whole-tree harvesting of a coniferous forest

Abstract: The degree and extent of soil compaction, which may reduce productivity of forest soils, is believed to vary by
the type of harvesting system, and a field-based study was conducted to compare soil compaction from cut-to-length
(CTL) and whole-tree (WT) harvesting operations. The CTL harvesting system used less area to transport logs to the land-
ings than did the WT harvesting system (19%–20% vs. 24%–25%). At high soil moisture levels (25%–30%), both CTL
and WT harvestings caused a significant increase of soil resistance to penetration (SRP) and bulk density (BD) in the track
compared with the undisturbed area (p < 0.05). In the center of trails, however, only WT harvesting resulted in a signifi-
cant increase of SRP and BD compared with the undisturbed area (p < 0.05). Slash covered 69% of the forwarding trail
area in the CTL harvesting units; 37% was covered by heavy slash (40 kgm–2) while 32% was covered by light slash
(7.3 kgm–2). Heavy slash was more effective in reducing soil compaction in the CTL units (p < 0.05). Prediction models
were developed that can be used to estimate percent increases in SRP and BD over undisturbed areas for both CTL and
WT harvesting systems.

Introduction
With an increasing demand for fire hazard reduction and
ecosystem restoration treatments in the Inland Northwest,
USA, multiple entries of heavy equipment into forest stands
are often required to achieve forest management objectives
(Han et al. 2006). Managers faced with choosing between
different harvesting equipment options and methods in di-
verse soil conditions require information on expected soil
impacts in order to minimize the impact on soil physical
properties (Wronski and Murphy 1994). Soil compaction oc-
curs as a result of applied loads, vibration, and pressure
from equipment that is used during harvesting and site prep-
aration activities (Adams and Froehlich 1984). Soil compac-
tion can be characterized as a breakdown of surface
aggregates, which leads to decreased macropore space in
the soil and a subsequent increase in the volume of soil rel-
ative to air space, leading to an increase in bulk density
(BD) and soil resistance to penetration (SRP) (Adams and
Froehlich 1984; Pritchett and Fisher 1987; Gomez et al.
2002). A decrease in soil macroporosity can impede root
penetration, water infiltration, and gas and nutrient exchange
(Quesnel and Curran 2000), and these changes can result in
a reduction, increase, or no change in tree regeneration and
growth.
In the Inland Northwest, whole-tree (WT) and cut-to-
length (CTL) harvesting systems are commonly used in
mechanized harvesting operations. CTL harvesting is be-
coming increasingly popular, but about 65% of the current
infrastructure continues to be based on WT harvesting

(Ponsse 2005). Debate over the relative merits of each sys-
tem has recently been renewed in relation to fuel reduction
treatments and small wood harvesting. CTL harvesting has
the potential to significantly reduce site-related problems
such as soil compaction and loss of nutrients that can occur
with WT harvesting. The CTL harvesting process creates a
slash mat in front of the machine with tree limbs removed
during tree processing at the stump. This slash mat distrib-
utes the weight of the harvester or forwarder over a larger
area and reduces direct contact between the machine tire
and the soil surface. In addition, CTL harvesting can mini-
mize ruts by using slash to reinforce skid trails and protect
against compaction (Eliasson and Wa¨sterlund 2007). The
WT harvesting system uses a skidder to drag the entire tree
to the landing for processing after felling. The use of WT
harvesting is popular among fuel reduction proponents be-
cause fire hazard is effectively reduced by removing whole
trees from high-density stands. WT harvesting, however,
has high potential for soil compaction and disturbance be-
cause skidder travel tends to sweep duff and litter from
trails, exposing bare mineral soil (Hartsough et al. 1997).
Overall, soil impacts are a function of both the degree of
soil impact (percent change in soil condition) and the extent
of soil impact (percentage of area affected). The degree of
soil compaction is related to soil texture (Page-Dumroese et
al. 2006), soil moisture, harvesting system (Adams and
Froehlich 1984), amount of logging slash (Wronski 1980;
McMahon and Evanson 1994), and number of machine
passes (Soane 1986; McDonald and Seixas 1997). William-
son and Neilsen (2000) indicated that soils in dry forests or
those formed on coarser gravelly parent material resisted
compaction more than soils in wet forests or those formed
from finer-grained materials. Soil moisture at the time of
machine traffic also has a major influence on the reduction
and redistribution of pore space as soils are compacted
(Adams and Froehlich 1984). Dry soils are more resistant to
changes in pore size and distribution but this resistance is
reduced as soil moisture increases (McDonald and Seixas
1997; Han et al. 2006). One of the critical factors affecting
the degree of soil compaction is the number of machine
passes in a ground-based system. Maximum soil compaction
normally occurs within the first 10 passes of a harvesting
machine (Gent and Ballard 1984), with the greatest impact
occurring in the first few passes (Froehlich et al. 1980; Han
et al. 2006).
The extent of soil impact is also influenced by the har-
vesting equipment and system used. For example, a single
logging operation using crawler tractors or rubber-tired skid-
ders typically produces compacted soils on 20% to 35% of
the area harvested (Adams 1990). Steinbrenner and Gessel
(1955) found that skid roads comprised 26% of a tractor-
logged site. Lanford and Stokes (1995) compared skidder
systems with forwarder systems and found that skidder sys-
tems disturbed a greater area and compacted more soil than
forwarder systems. McNeel and Ballard (1992) found that in
units using CTL harvesting, trails occupied less than 20% of
the harvested area, and more than 13% of the area experi-
enced only light disturbance. Bettinger et al. (1994) ob-
served
that
logging trails
occupied
23%
of the
total
harvested area in a CTL unit.
Our field-based study was performed to broaden existing
knowledge of the degree and extent of impacts of CTL and
WT harvesting systems on fine-textured soils in northern
Idaho. The specific objectives were to (1) quantify the ex-
tent of trail area used for primary wood transport, (2) meas-
ure the degree of soil compaction caused by harvesting
activities, (3) assess the potential of a slash mat to reduce
soil compaction on CTL harvesting fields, and (4) develop
prediction models to estimate the percent increase in soil
compaction from baseline data after CTL or WT harvesting.
Methods
Site description
The study site was established on a Potlatch Company
forest stand about 4 miles northwest of Deary in northern
Idaho (46850’27@N, 116840’42@W), USA. The forest stand
was
composed
of
Douglas-fir
(Pseudotsuga
menziesii
(Mirb.) Franco), grand fir (Abies grandis (Dougl. ex D.
Don) Lindl.), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex
Loud.), and Western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.). The
study site was 19.5 ha with an average tree diameter at
breast height (DBH) of 27 cm, an average tree height of
20 m, and a ground slope ranging from 2% to 32%.
Study area soils were Andosols in the WRB (FAO) classi-
fication and consisted of the Helmer series (ashy over
loamy, amorphic over mixed superactive, firigid, Alfic Un-
divitrand) or the Vassar series (ashy over loamy, amorphic
over isotic, Typic Vitricryand) (Soil Survey Staff 1999).
Helmer soils are located at toeslopes and footslopes and are
moderately
well
drained
with
a
shallow
fragipan
on
slopes >25%. Vassar soils, formed in loess and volcanic ash
overlying material weathered from granite, gneiss, or schist,
were usually found on slopes <15%. The bedrock in the
study stands was situated at 130–140 cm. The study site
had a mean annual precipitation of 750 mm and an average
annual air temperature of 6 8C. This area was first harvested
in 1943 using manual felling and tractor skidding.
Study design and harvesting operations
Two units within the study area were selected. Each unit
was divided into two subunits for the two different harvest-
ing systems (Fig. 1). CTL and WT harvesting systems were
randomly assigned within each unit (CTL 1 and WT 1; CTL
2 and WT 2). Harvest units and subunits were selected to
have similar slope, aspect, soil, and stand composition.
The harvest prescription for the study area was clear-
cutting. Harvesting took place between May and June
2005 using either CTL or WT harvesting. CTL harvesting
operations used a Valmet 500T harvester (machine mass
21 800 kg) and a Valmet 890 forwarder (machine mass
16 800 kg, maximum permissible load 18 000 kg). For the
WT harvesting operations, a Timbco T435 feller-buncher
(machine mass 26 000 kg), a CAT D-518 track-based skid-
der (machine mass 12 600 kg), a PC 220 Komatsu pro-
cessor (machine mass 23 400 kg), and a PC 200 Komatsu
loader (machine mass 21 400 kg) were used. General har-
vesting trails were laid out by harvester and feller-buncher
operators before harvesting based on topography and land-
ing locations along the hauling road. Because of changes
in technology since the last harvesting operation, only two
of the old skid trails could be effectively used for this op-

eration; other old trails were not readily useable with the
newer CTL and WT harvesting systems. Farbo (1996) pro-
vides a detailed chronological and geographical record of
185 Potlatch logging camps from 1903 to 1986, but this
record does not contain detailed information on old skid
trails.
Data collection and analysis
After harvester and feller-buncher operations, all trails in-
stalled by harvesting equipment (feller-buncher and har-
vester) were sketched on the map to count the number of
machine passes on each trail. Trails were divided into inter-
vals of 15 to 30 m prior to skidding and forwarding activ-
ities. The lengths of the intervals were marked on nearby
landmarks such as stumps, logs, and residual trees and were
also marked on the trail map. We followed the forwarder
and skidder at a safe distance and counted the number of
passes over each section of the trail. In this study, move-
ments of the harvester and feller-buncher were not included
in the number of machine passes, since one pass of a
tracked machine does not significantly impact this soil type
(Han et al. 2006). A machine pass was defined as one round
trip (one round trip = one trip empty + one trip loaded) re-
gardless of whether the forwarder or skidder was fully or
partially loaded with wood.
After harvesting, GPS data were collected with a Trimble
Geo XT unit at every 15 m along the centerline of the trails
to create a post-harvest trail map. The width of each trail
was measured every 15 m to determine the average width.
In the CTL block, width of the trail center and width of the
wheel track were also measured, since the forwarder tended
to repeatedly travel the same track. The skidder tracks of the
WT subunits were more diffuse and not easily delineated,
but there were good indications (i.e., ruts) of the wheel track
and center area within the trails. The GPS and trail width
data were used to calculate trail area used for primary wood
transport in each harvest unit. From GPS data and the
sketched map including number of passes, a trail map by
machine pass category was created using ArcGIS 9.1 (ESRI
Inc. 1999; Fig. 1).
A Rimik CP40 recording cone penetrometer (Agridry,
Toowoomba, Australia) with a base cone area of 113 mm2
was used to measure SRP. Readings in kilopascals (kPa)
were automatically recorded at 25 mm increments as the pe-
netrometer was manually inserted to a depth of 300 mm.
Transects were installed across the center on all skid trails
every 30 m. On each transect, we measured SRP at the trail
center, in both tracks, and in reference sampling points (off-
trail area). Three replicates of SRP were taken at each point.
A total of 2907 SRP measurements were collected in all
subunits (Table 1). Davidson (1965) reported that SRP can
be measured correctly only when the cone penetrometer is
used at or near soil field capacity. Our SRP measurements
were collected when soil moisture conditions (25%–30% at
7.5 cm soil depth) were close to field capacity.
Soil bulk density was sampled along the same transects as

SRP, but transects were located at every 90 m across the
centerline. On each transect, BD samples were collected at
the center, from one of the tracks (left or right), and from
the reference area (off-trail area). We assumed that the refer-
ence area had not been driven on by harvesting machines
because the forest floor was intact and there was no indica-
tion of soil compression. A core sampler (147 cm3) was
used to collect BD samples at depths of 7.5 cm, 15 cm, and
22.5 cm. Soil cores were placed in plastic bags for transport
from the field. In the laboratory, soil samples were weighed,
oven-dried at 105 8C for 24 h, and reweighed. Net wet and
dry masses were recorded to the nearest 0.01 g. BD was cal-
culated with the gross soil dry mass and volume of the tube
and was reported in megagrams per cubic metre. Soil mois-
ture contents were calculated from each BD sample and ad-
ditional soil cores were taken to monitor soil moisture
during harvesting operations. A total of 954 soil BD samples
were collected (Table 1).
During harvesting operations and data collection, soil
moisture contents were relatively constant, ranging from
25% to 30% at 7.5 cm soil depth. However, soil moisture
contents in CTL subunits were slightly lower than those in
WT subunits (23%–25% vs. 29%–30%). In all subunits,
average soil moisture contents were highest in the upper
soil layers and decreased with increasing soil depth. There
was intermittent light rain for 4 days during the harvesting
operation, but it did not cause significant changes in soil
moisture at any soil depth.
Logging slash was also surveyed along the same transects
as the BD samples and SRP data. Slash was classified into
three different levels: bare (no slash), light (<7.3 kgm–2),
and heavy (<40.0 kgm–2). Slash mass was calculated using
the downed woody debris survey method outlined by Brown
(1974).
Data analysis was performed using Statistical Analysis
System (SAS) (SAS Institute Inc. 2001) and Statistical Pack-
age for the Social Sciences (SPSS) (SPSS Inc. 1998). Data
analysis was performed separately for units 1 and 2, since
the reference values of the two units were clearly different
(Table 2). Data were evaluated for normality before running
the analyses. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to com-
pare the degree of soil compaction between the two different
harvesting systems. The Kruskal–Wallis and multiple com-
parison tests were performed to test for differences among

the three sampling regions (track, center, and reference).
These tests were performed separately for each harvesting
system (CTL and WT) and at each soil depth (7.5 cm,
15 cm, and 22.5 cm). The effect of slash was tested using a
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and regression
analysis was used to develop the models that estimate the
percent increase of SRP or BD. In prediction models, the
forward selection method was used to search a suitable sub-
set of explanatory variables. The significance level was set
to 5% (a = 0.05).
Results and discussion
Degree of soil compaction in the trails
Soil resistance to penetration (SRP)
In the reference areas, SRP readings ranged from 913 to
1191 kPa at 7.5 cm soil depth and increased with increasing
soil depth in both units (Table 3). At all soil depths, there
was a significant difference in SRP readings between units
1 and 2 (Tables 2 and 3) although both units had the same
forest stand and soil texture (ashy silt loam). However,
within each unit, CTL and WT subunits had similar SRP
readings at all soil depths except for 7.5 cm. At this depth,
SRP in the WT subunits was significantly higher than that in
the CTL subunits (p < 0.05). Because of this initial differ-
ence between CTL and WT subunits at 7.5 cm soil depth,
we used the percent increase of SRP resulting from harvest-
ing activities to compare SRP readings between CTL and
WT subunits.
In both units and with both types of harvesting, we noted
an increase of SRP in the center and track of the trails com-
pared with the reference area (Table 3 and Fig. 2). WT har-
vesting resulted in a significant increase of SRP in both the
center and the track areas as compared with the reference
area (p < 0.05). In the CTL subunits, however, only the
SRP readings in the track area were significantly higher
than those in the reference area at all soil depths (p < 0.05).
In the center of the trail, WT subunits had higher SRP
values than CTL subunits at all soil depths except for
7.5 cm in unit 2 (Fig. 2). In unit 1, SRP in the CTL subunit
increased 24%–28% at all soil depths, compared with the
reference area. In the WT subunit, SRP increases ranged
from 39% to 42% for all soil depths (Fig. 2). In unit 2, we
found similar percent increases of SRP but the values were
lower than those for unit 1, where initial SRP readings were
lower than those in unit 2. This result indicated that initial
soil compaction level strongly affected the degree of soil
compaction following harvesting operations. In both units,
WT harvesting caused more soil compaction at the center
of trails than CTL harvesting, particularly below 15 cm soil
depth. In harvesting operations, the forwarder in the CTL
blocks remained in the wheel tracks created during previous
trips and did not drive on the center of the trails. These re-
sults are consistent with those of other studies (Allbrook
1986; Han et al. 2006; Page-Dumroese et al. 2006). Han et
al. (2006) found similar results on other fine-textured soils
in the Inland Northwest, USA, where CTL harvesting did
not create significant soil compaction in the center of the
trail compared with the reference areas. However, the skid-
der used in WT harvesting did not use the same tracks and

caused a high degree of soil disturbance across the entire
skid trail. Allbrook (1986) also found that WT harvesting
on a sandy loam soil at high soil moisture contents caused a
significant increase of SRP in the center of the trails.
In the wheel track, percent increases of SRP were higher
in CTL blocks than in WT blocks (p < 0.05; Fig. 2). In both
units, the CTL subunit had an SRP increase of 90%–150%,
while the increase in SRP in the WT subunit was 59%–
101%. Additionally, increases of SRP were larger in the top
soil layer (within 7.5 cm of the soil surface) and smaller in
deeper soil layers (Fig. 2). Other studies have reported the
percent change of SRP following CTL and WT harvesting.
Han et al. (2006) reported that in fine-loamy soils with
21%–30% soil moisture, SRP readings increased up to
260% in the track after CTL harvesting. Allbrook (1986)
found that on a sandy loam soil with a moisture content of
38%, WT harvesting resulted in a 157% increase of SRP in
the track. Williamson and Neilsen (2000) reported that SRP
after WT harvesting increased by 167% under wet condi-
tions on a sandy loam soil. Compared with past studies, this
study found a smaller increase of SRP. Although soil mois-
ture conditions were comparable between this study and past
studies, this study was performed on a silt loam soil while
past studies were conducted mostly on sandy loam soils.
Sandy loam, loam, and sandy clay loam soils are more
easily compacted than silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay
soils under similar soil moisture conditions (USDA 1996).
In this study, SRP readings in the track of the trail ranged
from 1877 to 2779 kPa in the CTL subunits and from 1793
to 2324 kPa in the WT subunits. High SRP readings such as
those found in our study may be close to the limiting level
for root and seedling growth. For example, seedling growth
is restricted at SRP values of 2500 kPa in dry soil conditions
(Greacen and Sands 1980). Sands and Bowen (1978) re-
ported that a critical soil resistance of 3000 kPa in sandy
soils was sufficient to prevent radiata pine root growth.
Based on our results, root and seedling growth could be re-
stricted in the wheel tracks of both harvesting systems, par-
ticularly when the soil is dry.
Soil bulk density (BD)
Average BD values for the trail center, wheel track, and
reference area are summarized in Table 4. In the reference
area, BD values were similar between CTL and WT sub-
units at all three soil depths (p > 0.05). In both units, the
top soil layer had the lowest BD value, ranging from 0.86
to 0.91 Mgm–3, and the values increased steadily with in-
creasing soil depth, up to 1.27 Mgm–3 at 22.5 cm (Table 4).
In CTL subunits there were no significant differences in
BD between the center of the trail and the reference area at
any soil depth (Table 4). In the wheel tracks, however, both
harvesting systems caused significant increases of BD com-
pared with the reference area. The largest increase in BD
was observed at the 7.5 cm soil depth: 34%–39% in the
WT subunits and 27%–28% in the CTL subunits (Fig. 3).
In wheel tracks in both units, WT harvesting resulted in a
greater increase in soil compaction at all soil depths than
CTL harvesting, but differences between CTL and WT har-
vesting were not significant (p > 0.05). The different trends
of SRP and BD could be explained by slight differences in
soil moisture content between CTL and WT subunits.
Although SRP and BD were measured at CTL and WT sub-
units during the same periods, the CTL subunits had lower
moisture contents than the WT subunits. Lower moisture
contents in the CTL subunits could contribute to higher
SRP owing to higher frictional forces. The percent increase
of BD in this study was comparable to those reported in past
studies (McNeel and Ballard 1992; Williamson and Neilsen
2000). In CTL harvesting, McNeel and Ballard (1992) re-
ported that the average wheel track BD increased up to
20% more than the measurement from the adjacent control
sites on a sandy loam soil. Williamson and Neilsen (2000)
reported that after WT harvesting, BD increased by 40% in
wet soil conditions. However, other studies (Allbrook 1986;
McNeel and Ballard 1992; Lanford and Stokes 1995) ob-
served a slightly lower percent increase in BD than this
study. Allbrook (1986) found that WT harvesting on soil
with 38% moisture resulted in a 23% increase in soil BD in
the wheel track of trails. The differences from past studies
may have been caused by a combined effect of soil mois-
ture, soil texture, harvesting system, and initial soil proper-
ties (i.e., initial BD) (Froese 2004). Han et al. (2006)
investigated the effect of soil moisture on soil compaction
by running CTL harvesting machines at three different lev-
els of soil moisture. They reported that soil moisture was a
major factor affecting the compactability of soils.
Heavy harvesting equipment may decrease soil macro-
porosity, leading to poor water infiltration and gas exchange
and thus negatively affecting soil biological activity and root

growth. Lacey and Ryan (2000) reported that if bulk density
is increased more than 15%, soil compaction may restrict
root growth. Bulk density values that may limit root growth
appear to vary with soil texture, tree species, and experi-
mental conditions (Miller et al. 2004). Forristal and Gessel
(1955) estimated that 1.25 Mgm–3 was the upper limit of
BD for root growth in sandy loam soils, whereas Heilman
(1981) suggested that root-limiting BD was closer to 1.7–
1.8 Mgm–3 in sandy loam to loam-textured soils. Cullen et
al. (1991) observed no root penetration at BD over 1.9 Mgm–3.
In this study, BD measurements in the wheel track after har-
vesting ranged from 1.10 to 1.36 Mgm–3 in the CTL subunits
and from 1.13 to 1.43 Mgm–3 in the WT subunits, indicating
that new trees growing in the track area of the skidding and
forwarding trails may have difficulty achieving root penetra-
tion in the compacted soils.
The relationship between soil resistance to penetration
(SRP) and bulk density (BD)
For this study, soil resistance to penetration and bulk den-
sity were measured to estimate the degree of soil compac-
tion in each harvesting unit. Although the two different
methods were applied at the same sampling points, results
from SRP readings in the wheel tracks were not consistent
with those from our BD cores. In several past studies, the
relationship between SRP and BD was reported for several
soil texture classes (Allbrook 1986; Clayton 1990; Vazquez
et al. 1991; Froese 2004; Ampoorter et al. 2007). Allbrook
(1986) and Clayton (1990) stated that SRP was related pos-

itively to BD. They also found that compacted soils exhib-
ited high increases in SRP, yet only small increases in BD.
In our study, we found trends similar to those of past stud-
ies, but BD was not strongly correlated with SRP (r2 = 0.30;
Fig. 4). The poor correlation between SRP and BD could be
explained by soil moisture, organic matter content, rock
fragments, and field variability. Vazquez et al. (1991) sug-
gested that strong correlations between SRP and BD are lim-
ited to homogeneous soils under controlled conditions. Soil
resistance to penetration is measured as the friction between
the cone and soil particles when a cone penetrometer is
pushed into the soil. Therefore, the most important factor af-
fecting soil resistance to penetration is soil moisture (Bennie
and Burger 1988). In our study, the low correlation could be
attributed to slight differences in soil moisture content be-
tween CTL and WT subunits.
The poor correlation between SRP and BD could also be
explained by high spatial variability. In our study, measured

SRP and BD had large standard deviations within each sub-
unit despite three subsamples per sampling point and about
1000 samplings (Tables 1, 3, and 4). Although three replica-
tions for SRP were performed at the same sampling point,
values of SRP among three replications varied without an
apparent cause at some sampling points. Silva et al. (1989)
suggested that field analyses of soil data are difficult be-
cause of spatial variability. For example, organic matter con-
tent and its distribution in a soil would affect soil physical
properties including compactability (Zhang et al. 1997).
Importance of slash to mitigate compaction
CTL harvesting and the creation of a slash mat could be
an effective way to minimize soil compaction (McMahon
and Evanson 1994; McDonald and Seixas 1997; Han et al.
2006). However, the trail area that is not covered by slash
may be more severely impacted owing to direct contact be-
tween the machine track and the soil surface. In our study,
slash covered 69% of the forwarding trail area in the CTL
harvesting subunits, with 37% of the trail area covered by
heavy slash (<40.0 kgm–2) and 32% of the trail area cov-
ered by light slash (<7.3 kgm–2).
In measurements of SRP, the buffering effect of slash on
mineral soil compaction was found when heavy or light
slash was added to the equipment track in unit 1, but slash
was not effective in unit 2 (Fig. 5). In unit 1, heavy slash
reduced the impacts of ground traffic by 210% at 7.5 cm
and 113% at 15 cm as compared with bare ground (no
slash). In terms of BD, only heavy slash helped to reduce
the machine-caused impacts at up to 15 cm soil depth in the
track of forwarding trails (Fig. 6). In both units, light slash
appeared to be effective in minimizing soil surface impacts
from harvesting activities, but this result was not significant
(p > 0.05; Figs. 5 and 6). A small amount of slash did not
provide enough cushioning in wet soil to absorb the ground
pressure and vibration of the harvesting equipment. Light
slash tended to be crushed into pieces and could no longer
distribute and absorb the impact of the machine. Han et al.
(2006) reported similar results when a light slash mat
(<7.5 kgm–2) was left in a CTL harvesting on wet soil. Ja-
kobsen and Moore (1981) reported that the critical amount
of slash required to protect soil is 18 kgm–2. It appears that
slash levels will likely have to be adjusted for each soil tex-
ture class and moisture level (Han et al. 2006). Other studies
have shown that the effectiveness of slash is an interaction
of the amount of slash and the number of machine passes
(McDonald and Seixas 1997; Han et al. 2006). Initially,
slash mats provide an adequate soil buffer, but with increas-
ing machine passes the slash mat breaks down and becomes
less effective at minimizing soil impacts from machine traf-
fic. In our study, no significant effect of slash on SRP read-
ings was shown in the center of forwarding trails (p > 0.05).
Spatial extent of skid and forwarding trails
Knowledge of the area used for skidding or forwarding
trails is important in assessing damage to the soil from har-
vesting operations. The trail area usually varies with terrain,
tree size and volume, harvesting methods, moisture condi-
tions at harvesting, equipment type, and harvesting system
(Bettinger et al. 1994; Landsberg et al. 2003; Miller et al.
2004).
In this study, only the trail areas used for primary wood
transport (i.e., skidding or forwarding) were used to quantify
the extent of trails and soil compaction (Fig. 1). Although
the two different harvesting systems were applied in similar
terrain, tree density, and moisture conditions, CTL harvest-
ing created less trail area for primary wood transport (19%–
20% of total harvest block) than did WT harvesting (24%–
26% of total harvest block) in both units (p < 0.05). The pri-
mary difference in trail area between the two harvesting sys-
tems is due to the post-harvest trail width. In both units trail
length was not significantly different between CTL (532–
561 mha–1) and WT (534–553 mha–1) harvesting, but the
average trail width in the WT subunits (4.47–4.63 m) was
greater than that in the CTL subunits (3.61–3.63 m) (p <
0.05; Table 5).
In the CTL blocks, track width was easily discernable,
since the forwarder repeatedly traversed the same area
within the trail and did not cross the center area. It was dif-
ficult to delineate the track area from the rest of the skid
trail area in the WT harvesting units because when the trees
were skidded the previous track was erased. The average
width of the center area between tracks in the forwarding
trails was 1.78–1.80 m.
When past studies evaluated compacted areas at a CTL
harvesting site, they generally included the entire trail, not
distinguishing between the center and the track of the trail
(McNeel and Ballard 1992; Gingras 1994; Lanford and
Stokes 1995). However, this study found that the center of
the trail and the undisturbed area were not significantly dif-
ferent in terms of SRP and BD (Tables 3 and 4). Therefore,
although the whole forwarding trail after CTL harvesting oc-
cupied a large area of the unit, when only the impacted track

area was considered, the spatial extent of the compacted
area was only 10% of the harvested area.
In both units, GIS analysis allowed us to determine the
percentage of trail area in each of the number of machine
pass categories (Fig. 1). The collection of machine pass
data is difficult, but provides a visual representation of heav-
ily trafficked areas and the extent of the most severe soil
compaction. It also provides a database representing historic
use of the site for managers. This information may be used
to select harvesting systems and trails in future logging op-
erations, and can also assist in establishing plans for tree re-
generation in the harvested area. In this study, the highest
percentage of trail area in the CTL subunits fell in the 4 to
5 pass category (32%), while the ‘‘less than 5’’ pass cate-
gory was highest (34%) in the WT subunits. The combined
0 to 20 pass categories accounted for about 85% of the total
trail area in the WT subunits. In the CTL subunits, the com-
bined 3 to 10 pass categories accounted for 75% of the total
trail area (Fig. 1). In both harvesting units, about 70% of the
total trail area was defined as severely compacted because
most soil compaction occurred after a few passes of a laden
logging machine; approximately 80% of soil compaction
was in the top soil layer.
Prediction models to estimate potential soil impacts
For both harvesting systems, we developed prediction
models to estimate the percent increase of SRP and BD
based on the number of machine passes, distance from land-
ing area, initial SRP or BD, and slash added to the trail (Ta-
bles 6 and 7). This information is useful when forest
managers develop strategies to prevent unacceptable levels
of soil damage that may degrade soil productivity.
In both harvesting units, our models for SRP (r2 = 0.53 to
0.67) provided better fits to the data than those for BD (r2 =
0.36 to 0.55) (Tables 6 and 7). The percent increase of SRP
and BD increased with an increase in the number of ma-
chine passes. However, the distance from the landing area
and initial SRP showed a negative relationship with the per-
cent increase of SRP, meaning the percent change was less
pronounced as distance from the landing increased.
For all three soil depths, our models indicate that the
number of machine passes is highly correlated with in-
creases in SRP in both CTL and WT harvesting systems
(Fig. 7). However, this is not the case for BD: in the wheel
track, most soil compaction occurred after a few passes of a
laden logging machine, and 70% of soil compaction in the
top soil sampling level was achieved after only five machine

passes in the CTL block (Fig. 7). In the WT block, 80% of
soil compaction in the top 7.5 cm of soil occurred after only
10 machine passes (Fig. 7). Soil compaction continued to in-
crease with additional passes in both harvesting units, but
there was a lower level of increase or no further increase
after five passes in the CTL harvesting sites and 10 passes
in the WT harvesting sites. Rollerson (1990) reported similar
results (most soil compaction occurred during the first 10–20
passes) after WT harvesting, whereas Williamson and Neil-
sen (2000) found that 62% of final soil compaction occurred
after only one pass on skid trails. Han et al. (2006) also
found that there was a rapid increase in SRP up to the sec-
ond pass of a fully loaded forwarder during CTL harvesting.
The initial values of SRP and BD were highly negatively
correlated with their respective percent increases in the pre-
diction models (Fig. 8). Percent increases were greater in
soils with lower initial SRP and BD. Page-Dumroese et al.
(2006) also reported that as initial BD increased, the level
of change decreased. These results can be useful in deter-
mining the limitations on harvesting as a function of soil
moisture content and initial soil BD or SRP readings. High
initial SRP and BD values under dry-season conditions may
result
in
less
soil
compaction
after
operations
(Page-
Dumroese et al. 2006). Similar results were observed by
Williamson and Neilsen (2000) and Han et al. (2006).
They also suggested that scheduling harvesting operations
during drier conditions could minimize soil impacts.
The prediction model we developed shows that the per-
cent increases in SRP and BD are negatively correlated
with the distance from the landing area (Fig. 9). Trails close
to the landing area receive higher density machine traffic,
which results in greater compaction, than areas farther from
the landing area.
Conclusion and management implications
Soil compaction is a common consequence of mechanized
forest harvesting operations, especially when soil moisture is
high (around 30%). This study was conducted to compare
the degree and extent of soil compaction between CTL and
WT harvesting systems in northern Idaho, USA. At high
moisture levels, both CTL and WT harvesting caused a high
degree of soil compaction in the track of the trails. CTL har-
vesting caused less soil compaction in the trail center and

used less area for primary wood transport compared with
WT harvesting. Therefore, WT harvesting may require more
careful planning and layout than CTL harvesting when forest
managers design a harvesting plan using a ground-based har-
vesting system. Slash in the CTL harvesting unit appears to
be effective in minimizing soil compaction, but only 37% of
the CTL forwarding trails were covered by heavy slash
(<40.0 kgm–2). Therefore, careful planning of the slash mat
and ensuring its continuity on the skid or forwarding trails is
critical to limiting the severity of compaction.
Although harvesting technology changes, this study sup-
ports the use of designated and historic skid trails. Soils
with high initial BD were compacted less than those with
low initial BD. Since most soil compaction occurred after
the first few passes of machines used for skidding or for-
warding, restriction of traffic to designated skid trails would
be an effective strategy to minimize soil compaction on ash-
cap or fine-textured soils that have low initial BD. There-
fore, designing harvesting operations with due consideration
to strategies such as slash treatments could help limit soil
compaction in areas close to log landings.
