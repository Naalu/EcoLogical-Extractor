Introduction
For the purpose of vegetation management, soil seed 
banks are viable seeds stored in litter (Oi horizon), 
duff (Oe+a horizon), or mineral soil that can germi-
nate when germination requirements are met (Bakker 
and others 1996, Thompson 1987). Seed banks provide 
propagules that may influence plant community chang-
es after disturbance events and management activities 
(van der Valk and Pederson 1989). Not all plant species 
form large and persistent soil seed banks. Species that 
are short-lived aboveground and associated with distur-
bance often develop the largest and most persistent seed 
banks (Koniak and Everett 1982; Roberts 1981; Wienk 
and others 2004). For example, the native biennial 
spreading fleabane (Erigeron divergens) and the non-
native biennial common mullein (Verbascum thapsus) 
are abundant in seed banks of ponderosa pine (Pinus 
ponderosa) forests near Flagstaff, Arizona (Abella and 
others 2007, Korb and others 2005). However, some na-
tive perennials, such as White Mountain sedge (Carex 
geophila), mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia montana), 
and muttongrass (Poa fendleriana), also occur in these 
seed banks.
Soil seed banks are important for vegetation man-
agement in ponderosa pine forests in at least four ways. 
First, seed banks may provide on-site seed sources for 
species considered undesirable (for example, exotic 
species) for site colonization after management activi-
ties such as tree thinning. Second, they may provide 
seed sources for early successional species and species 
considered desirable (for example, perennial grasses) 
that hasten vegetation recovery after disturbance. Third, 
seed banks can provide seedlings for the establishment 
and maintenance of some aboveground plant popu-
lations in the absence of major disturbance. Fourth, 
seed banks lacking desirable species may indicate that 
seeding or other treatments are necessary to meet man-
agement objectives for understory vegetation. Locally 
calibrated estimates of seed bank size and composition 
could assist resource managers in determining pos-
sible understory responses to management activities. 
Knowledge of these seed bank characteristics could be 
used to predict which exotic species could become man-
agement concerns or for deciding whether to seed native 
species based on their abundance in seed banks (Glass 
1989). Although on- or off-site seed dispersal from ex-
isting vegetation is also important (Wienk and others 
2004), several studies have found partial correlations 
between seed bank composition and species colonizing 
sites after disturbance (Korb and others 2005, Springer 
and Hastings 2004).
Estimating Soil Seed Bank Characteristics 
in Ponderosa Pine Forests Using 
Vegetation and Forest-Floor Data
Scott R. Abella and Judith D. Springer
Abstract—Soil seed banks are important for vegetation management because they contain propagules of 
species that may be considered desirable or undesirable for site colonization after management and disturbance 
events. Knowledge of seed bank size and composition before planning management activities facilitates proactive 
management by providing early alerts of exotic species presence and of abilities of seed banks to promote 
colonization by desirable species. We developed models in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in northern 
Arizona to estimate the size and richness of mineral soil seed banks using readily observable vegetation and forest-
floor characteristics. Regression models using three or fewer predictors explained 41 to 59 percent of the variance in 
0- to 2-inch (0- to 5-cm) seed densities of total and native perennial seed banks. Key predictors included aboveground 
plant species richness/10.8 ft2 (1 m2), litter weight and thickness, and tree canopy type (open or closed). Both total 
and native perennial seed banks were larger and richer in plots containing: (1) species-rich understories, (2) sparse 
litter, and (3) tree canopy openings. A regression tree model estimated that seed bank density of native perennials is 
14-fold greater if aboveground plant richness exceeds eight species/10.8 ft2, forest-floor leaf litter is < 1 inch (2.5 cm) 
thick, and tree canopies are open.

Our objective was to develop a first approximation 
of models to estimate seed bank density and species 
richness using soil and aboveground vegetation vari-
ables that are more easily measured in the field than the 
seed bank characteristics themselves. Our models were 
developed for ponderosa pine forests in a local study 
area. Thus, the models require more extensive testing 
before extrapolation to other ponderosa pine forests 
that potentially differ from our study area in species 
pools and in other factors affecting seed banks.
Methods
Study Area
We conducted this study on forty-five, 82 × 66 ft (25 
× 20 m), 0.12-acre (0.05-ha) plots in the southern half 
of the Northern Arizona University Centennial Forest. 
The Centennial Forest consists of 640-acre (259-ha) 
sections that alternate with U.S. Forest Service sec-
tions within the Coconino National Forest, about 5 to 
15 mi (8 to 24 km) southwest of the city of Flagstaff 
in northern Arizona. The maximum distance between 
plots was 10 mi (16 km). Forests in the study area 
are pure ponderosa pine with occasional Gambel oak 
(Quercus gambelii). Understory vegetation is domi-
nated by grasses, sedges, and forbs. Plot elevations 
ranged from 7,072 to 7,472 ft (2,156 to 2,278 m), with 
slope gradients less than 10 percent. Plots were located 
and stratified by a terrestrial ecosystem classification 
following methods in Abella and others (2007). Five 
plots were located within each of three randomly 
selected mapping units of each of the 536, 570, and 
585 terrestrial ecosystem survey soil types. Soils 
in these types are primarily classified as Typic and 
Mollic Eutroboralfs (Miller and others 1995). Annual 
precipitation at the Flagstaff airport, about 10  mi  
(16 km) east of the study area, averages 21 inches  
(54 cm). Approximately 50 percent of this precipita-
tion is snow (1950 to 2006 records; Western Regional 
Climate Center, Reno, NV). July high temperatures 
average 82oF (28oC), and January low temperatures 
average 16oF (-9oC).
Field Sampling
Plots spanned a range of overstory characteristics 
and were located either in openings or in dense patches 
of young trees (fig. 1). Locations for plots were estab-
lished by randomly selecting a geographic coordinate 
within each soil mapping unit, and then selecting 
vegetation patches closest to that coordinate using 
field reconnaissance. Density of trees greater than 0.4 
inches (1 cm) in diameter at breast height ranged from 
0 to 1,392 trees/acre (3,440 trees/ha) among plots. 
Basal area ranged from 0 to 274 ft2/acre (63 m2/ha). 
We measured the diameter of every tree (> 0.4 inches 
[1 cm] in diameter) on each plot and classified tree 
canopy types as primarily open (usually near old trees 
> age 120 years based on increment boring) or closed 
(dense tree patches). These general canopy types are 
readily recognized in the field (fig. 1) and have been 
used in several previous studies (for example, Vose 
and White 1987).
In each plot, we established a total of fifteen, 10.8-ft2 
(1-m2) subplots per plot. Subplots were systematically 
located at 2, 16, 41, 66, and 80 ft (0.5, 5, 12.5, 20, 
and 24.5 m) along the southern, central, and northern 
82-ft (25-m) plot lines. In these subplots, we measured 
litter (Oi horizon) thickness to the nearest 0.04 inch 
(0.1 cm) and visually estimated areal percent cover (at 
0.1, 0.25, 1, or 5 percent intervals) of each plant spe-
cies rooted in the subplots. We estimated tree canopy 
cover to the nearest 5 percent using a densitometer 
(Geographic Resource Solutions, Arcata, CA). We 
also collected a 0- to 2-inch (0- to 5-cm) sample of the 
mineral soil seed bank in each subplot using a 1.6-inch 
(4.2-cm) diameter metal corer. Each sample was 4.3 in3 
(70 cm3), and we composited samples on a plot basis 
for a plot seed bank sample of 64 in3 (1,050 cm3). O 
horizons can trap seeds (Abella and Covington 2007; 
Korb and others 2005), but we focused on mineral soil 
seed banks because O horizons were sparse on some 
plots. From soil pits at the southwestern and north-
eastern plot corners, we collected a composite 0- to 
6-inch (0- to 15-cm) mineral soil sample for determin-
ing soil texture (hydrometer method; Dane and Topp 
2002). We measured litter weight by collecting litter 
samples in 5.4-ft2 (0.5-m2) frames at soil pit locations. 
We then oven dried these samples at 158oF (70oC) for 
24 hours.
Plot and seed bank sampling occurred from June 
through August 2003. Based on published phenolo-
gies in the region (Clary and Kruse 1979), seedbank 
collections occurred before most species disperse 
seeds in late summer or fall. Thus, collections likely 
primarily represent the persistent seed bank (Baskin 
and Baskin 1998), although it is possible that some 
early flowering species contributed current-year seeds 
to samples.
Greenhouse Seed Bank Procedures
On the same day each sample was collected, we 
placed 7 in3 (120 cm3) of the composite seed bank sam-
ple from each plot in a greenhouse maintained at 75oF

3
(24oC). We placed samples in a layer about 0.4 inches 
(1 cm) thick on top of 18 in3 (300 cm3) of sterile pot-
ting soil in 43-in3 (700-cm3) square pots. We randomly 
arranged pots on greenhouse benches and watered the 
samples daily. The greenhouse was maintained with 
natural lighting, but we also provided samples with 
four hours of supplemental artificial lighting during 
fall and winter months (October through February). 
We identified and counted emerging seedlings (as 
a measure of seed density) every two weeks for six 
months. To meet possible chilling requirements for 
some species, we stored the remainder of samples 
(57  in3, 930 cm3 from each plot) at 23oF (-5oC) for 
four to six months. We then placed 7 in3 (120 cm3) of 
chilled sample from each plot in each of four sepa-
rate pots and treated these samples procedurally the 
same as the unchilled samples. Seed density between 
chilled and unchilled samples was not appreciably dif-
ferent, so we pooled data from these separate samples 
into 37-in3 (600-cm3) plot samples for calculating 0- 
to 2-inch (0- to 5-cm) seed densities/ft2 (0.09 m2) and 
species richness/0.13 ft2 (0.01 m2). We report richness 
for this sample area computed from our sample vol-
ume because species-accumulation curves are needed 
for extrapolating richness to larger volumes and areas 
(Bigwood and Inouye 1988). Plant nomenclature and 
classification of species as native or exotic followed 
NRCS (2004).
Statistical Analysis
The seed bank characteristics we analyzed in this 
study included: (1) total seed densities/ft2 (0.09 m2), 
(2) total species richness/0.13 ft2 (0.01 m2), (3) native 
perennial seed densities/ft2, and (4) native perennial 
species richness/0.13 ft2. We first examined bivariate 
correlations between these seed bank characteris-
tics and soil and aboveground vegetation variables 
(table 1). We then used multiple regression and re-
gression trees as exploratory models to estimate seed 
bank characteristics from these variables with a sam-
ple size of 45 plots. Analyses were performed with 
the software JMP (SAS Institute 2002). For multiple 
regression, we used a forward stepwise procedure 
for identifying predictor variables. Regression trees 
are nonparametric models that partition data into 
increasingly homogenous subsets and provide di-
chotomous keys to estimate a dependent variable at 
different values of predictor variables (Breiman and 
others 1984). The JMP version allows users to de-
termine the number of splits, so we stopped splitting

when adding more predictors resulted in increases of 
< 0.05 in R2. We employed JMP’s k-fold crossvalida-
tion (k = 5) to compute a cross-validated overall R2 
(1 - [crossvalidated sum of squares error / corrected 
sum of squares]).
Results
Of 49 total species detected in seed bank samples, 
10 percent were exotic and 43 percent were native 
perennials. Total average seed density was 54 seeds/
ft2 (0- to 2-inch layer; 583 seeds/m2) on closed tree 
canopy plots and 149 seeds/ft2 (1,611/m2) on open 
plots. Exotic species contributed 19 percent of these 
total seed densities on both closed and open plots. 
Common mullein constituted 78 (closed plots) and 
88 (open plots) percent of total average exotic seed 
density. Native perennials comprised 15 (closed plots) 
and 22 (open plots) percent of the total average seed 
density for all species. The most abundant native pe-
rennials in seed banks included White Mountain sedge, 
spreading sandwort (Arenaria lanuginosa), mountain 
muhly, muttongrass, and lobe-leaf groundsel (Packera 
multilobata).
Total seed densities in mineral soil seed banks were 
positively correlated with aboveground plant species 
richness/10.8 ft2 (1 m2; Pearson r = 0.54) and plant 
cover (r = 0.34). However, these seed densities were 
negatively correlated with ponderosa pine tree density 
(r = -0.40), basal area (r = -0.39), and litter thickness 
and weight (r = -0.47 for both). Similar to total seed 
densities, native perennial seed densities exhibited 
the following correlations with vegetation and forest-
floor variables: aboveground plant richness (r = 0.54) 
and cover (r = 0.45), ponderosa pine tree density (r = 
-0.38) and basal area (r = -0.27), and litter thickness 
(r = -0.39) and weight (r = -0.40). Total and native 
perennial species richness in seed banks had relation-
ships with these vegetation and forest-floor variables 
similar to those of seed densities. Additionally, neither 
seed density nor species richness were strongly corre-
lated (|r| <0.32) with 0- to 6-inch (0- to 15-cm) percent 
sand, silt, or clay.
Aboveground species richness, tree canopy type 
(open or closed), and litter weight explained 49 per-
cent of the variance in seed bank total seed densities 
and species richness in multiple regression models (ta-
ble 2). These three predictors explained 41 percent of 
the variance in native perennial seed densities. Fifty-
two percent of the variance in native perennial species 
richness was explained by these predictors and tree 
canopy percent cover.
Regression trees explained 47 to 59 percent of the 
variance in seed density using two or three predictors 
(fig. 2). Similar to multiple regression, aboveground 
species richness and tree canopy type were important 
predictors in these models. Litter thickness, rather than 
litter weight as in multiple regression, also was an im-
portant predictor. The greatest seed densities occurred 
on plots containing thin litter layers, high aboveground 
plant richness, and open canopies.
Discussion
The basic insights gained from the regression mod-
els include: (1) densities and species richness of seeds 
in mineral soils increased with decreasing forest-floor 
litter weight and thickness; (2) both total and native 
perennial seed densities and species richness in min-
eral soils were highest in areas with high aboveground 
plant species richness/10.8 ft2 (1 m2); and (3) patches 
with open canopies, typically near old trees, supported

aPlant species richness represents aboveground vegetation. Tree canopy type corresponds to open old-tree patches (0) or dense 
patches of small trees (1).
bCumulative proportion of variance explained for the dependent (y) variable based on stepwise predictor selection.
cAs an example, the equation for estimating total seeds/ft2 is the following: y = 100.9756 + 7.0217(aboveground plant species/10.8 ft2) 
+ 32.2178(canopy type) – 15.5909(litter weight). Metric conversions are as follows: seed bank seeds/ft2 = seeds/0.09 m2, seed 
bank species/0.13 ft2 = species/0.01 m2, and aboveground plant species/10.8 ft2 = species/m2.

larger and richer soil seed banks than patches of denser 
canopies containing many closely spaced small trees 
(figs. 1, 2).
Several factors could cause mineral soil seed 
banks to be smaller in areas with thick and heavy lit-
ter. Seeds may become trapped in litter so that fewer 
reach mineral soil (Korb and others 2005) or retain 
viability. Litter abundance increases in areas of high 
pine density, which may decrease seed banks by de-
creasing aboveground vegetation that provides seed 
inputs. This conjecture is consistent with the strong 
positive relationship we observed between seed bank 
density and aboveground plant richness. Aboveground 
richness itself was negatively correlated with pine 
density (r = -0.66) and basal area (r = -0.52). Our find-
ing of larger and richer seed banks in openings usually 
near large, old trees concurs with Vose and White’s 
(1987) data on seed rain by understory vegetation. 
These authors found that grass + forb seed rain aver-
aged more than 10 times greater below openings than 
below dense tree canopies in ponderosa pine forests 
near Flagstaff, Arizona (fig. 3). These data suggest 
that many seeds in our seed bank samples probably 
originated from relatively recent inputs by aboveg-
round vegetation. However, some seeds, such as those 
of common mullein that are long-lived in seed banks, 
were possibly deposited in our samples long ago (Warr 
and others 1993).
Regression models explained 41 to 59 percent of 
the variance in seed bank densities using three or 
fewer predictor variables (table 2, fig. 2). Imperfect 
measurement of predictors, plot-scale disturbance his-
tory, or other unmeasured factors could have resulted 
in unexplained variance. Our method of locating plots 
was not intended to assess the effects of disturbance 
history on seed banks. Increasing our understanding of 
relationships between disturbance history and contem-
porary seed banks would probably improve our ability 
to estimate seed bank size and composition (Korb and 
others 2005).
Management Implications
Our study and previous research (Vose and White 
1987) suggests that positive feedbacks exist between 
soil seed banks and aboveground vegetation. Seed 
banks, overall and specifically for native perennials, are 
richer and larger in patches where aboveground under-
story vegetation is most abundant. Unfortunately, this 
indicates that seed banks are less useful for increasing

and White (1987).

native understory vegetation in dense pine stands 
where existing understory vegetation is most depau-
perate. Our findings suggest that seed banks of some 
native perennials can be enhanced by increasing the 
vigor and richness of understory vegetation containing 
these species. Management techniques for accomplish-
ing this could include tree thinning, reducing grazing 
pressure especially during periods of seed production, 
prescribed burning timed to maintain seed production, 
or actively planting or seeding understory species.
