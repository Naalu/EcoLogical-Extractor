Abstract—The Grand Canyon Forest Partnership (GCFP), lo-
cated in Flagstaff, AZ, has implemented a 16-inch diameter breast
height cutting cap in the Fort Valley Restoration (Phase One)
Project to secure the support of environmental organizations for
urban interface forest restoration and fuels reduction projects.
This paper provides insights into the economic impacts of this
limitation by applying a simulated cap to realistic inventory,
logging, and revenue models developed from an earlier represen-
tative project—the GCFP’s 332-acre Fort Valley Research and
Demonstration (R&D) project. The simulation was possible on
only four of the nine R&D units, as these were the only units that
had trees greater than or equal to 16-inch d.b.h. available for
cutting. The simulated cutting cap resulted in implementation
cost increases of 5 to 19.4 percent, harvested fiber decreases of 10
to 39 percent on a volume basis, and reductions in operator net
returns ranging from 22.3 to 176 percent. The primary market for
harvested material, at the time of this analysis, was low-value
firewood and pallet stock that was supplemented by occasional
sales to high-value users of large diameter logs. The 16-inch cap
limited the operators’ ability to broker logs to these large diameter
users (for example, small volume viga manufacturers located in
the Phoenix, AZ, metropolitan area) who would pay upward of
$200 per ccf. Projections showed, however, that under more favor-
able market conditions, such as that of a regional pulp mill or
oriented strand board plant, the operators (and consequently the
GCFP) could better sustain, economically, the 16-inch cutting cap.
Introduction ____________________
The Grand Canyon Forests Partnership (GCFP), in
Flagstaff, AZ, is a collaborative effort between the Coconino
National Forest, Grand Canyon Forests Foundation, North-
ern Arizona University, and a number of other governmen-
tal and nongovernmental organizations. The GCFP seeks to
reduce the risk of catastrophic fire and restore forest eco-
system health through practices that are ecologically

sound, economically viable, and socially acceptable. Its
implementation strategy includes thinning of forest stands,
introducing low-intensity fire, restoring meadows, and
thoughtful minimization of trails and roads.
The GCFP finished its first treatment project, known as
the Fort Valley Research and Demonstration (R&D) Project,
during 1999. This 332-acre project is an adaptive manage-
ment experiment for researching presettlement reference
conditions, contemporary pretreatment conditions, and the
impact of four thinning alternatives on three forest stand
types. Thinning was limited to trees less than 22 inches in
diameter measured at breast height (d.b.h.). This project
serves as a demonstration site, providing on-the-ground
evidence and information so that the public can effectively
contribute, in a learned manner, to the process of treating
the urban-wildland forest interface in the greater Flagstaff
region.
The GCFP has been planning and working toward its next
treatment activity, the 1,700-acre Fort Valley Restoration
(Phase One) Project. This project is an interesting one in that
the GCFP implemented a cutting cap to limit thinning to
only those trees smaller than 16 inches d.b.h. By implement-
ing this cap, the GCFP responded to the concerns and forest
management desires of regional environmental organiza-
tions (SWFA 1996, 1998; Suckling 2000) and demonstrated
that GCFP’s intent is on forest fuels reduction and restora-
tion, and not commercial logging.
GCFP’s ability to treat forest stands over the 100,000-acre
urban wildland interface, however, is highly dependent
upon economics. Implementation is expensive, and this
project must eventually become financially sustainable;
independent, to some degree, of Federal dollars. The GCFP
realizes that the same material that is thinned from the
forests as part of the restorative stand treatment can be
recycled as a marketable resource. Wood fiber, in a favorable
market environment, has the potential to fund and sus-
tain forest treatment programs. A cutting limitation like
the 16-inch cap, however, can have negative financial
repercussions.
This paper provides insights into these economic impacts
by simulating the effects of a cap on stand conditions,
thinning models, and fiber markets that are representative
of the conditions of the greater Flagstaff urban-wildland.
The process and results of this simulation included:
• Collecting and characterizing representative stand pa-
rameters, which are summarized below in the section
titled “Fort Valley Research and Demonstration Project.”

• Amassing realistic thinning information and building
representative mathematical models; tasks that are
summarized in the section titled “The Cost to Treat.”
• Quantifying fiber markets representative of real re-
gional conditions and incorporating this information
into the models. The results of these activities are
presented in the section titled “Revenue Expectations.”
Fort Valley Research and
Demonstration Project ___________
The R&D project is north of Flagstaff near Highway 180
and Snow Bowl Road at an elevation of 7,400 to 7,600 ft
above sea level. This project consists of three areas that are
representative of different stand configurations—a yellow
pine area with more than five yellow pine trees per acre, a
mixed yellow pine and blackjack area with less than two
yellow pine trees per acre, and a blackjack area. (Yellow
pines are ponderosa pine trees characterized by yellow bark
and are larger in size and older than 150 years. Blackjacks
are younger and smaller ponderosa pine trees with black
bark.) The two yellow pine areas lie within the Fort Valley
Experimental Forest, while the blackjack area lies in the
Coconino National Forest along the eastern boundary of the
experimental forest. Figure 1 is a map of this project.
Each treatment area is subdivided into four units that
range from 32 to 41 acres. The four units are differentiated
by the type of the proposed treatment, designated as: 1.5-3,
2-4, 3-6, and control. Although these prescriptions provide
for different levels of thinning, they are anchored to the
presettlement condition as their template. Common to each
treatment is that all living presettlement trees, standing
snags, and trees greater than 22 inches d.b.h. are retained
(Flagstaff Urban/Wildland Interface Treatment Guide-
lines, 1998). In addition, all treatments called for the re-
moval of all trees 4 inches d.b.h. and smaller. The reader can
find additional information about these types of treatments
and their effects in the articles by W. Covington and others
(1997, 1998).
The Treatments
The 1.5-3 treatment is known as a full restoration pre-
scription. For every direct evidence of a dead presettlement
tree (stumps, snags, downed trees, and stump holes), 1.5
replacement trees are left whenever large (>16 inches d.b.h.)
and vigorous replacement trees are available within a 30 ft
radius of the evidence. If the only available good quality
replacement trees are smaller than 16 inches, then three
trees are marked for retention. When the available trees
within the 30 ft search radius are not acceptable due to
Figure 1—Map of the Fort Valley Research and Demonstration Project.

quality or mistletoe infection, the search radius is extended
to 60 ft.
The 2-4 treatment is known as an intermediate level of
thinning where more trees per presettlement evidence are
retained. In practice, two large or four small dominant and/
or vigorous trees are left for every evidence.
The 3-6 treatment is a minimal thinning plan that results
in an even greater density of replacement trees where three
large or six small trees are left per evidence.
The control units are untreated and will be used for
comparative purposes.
Existing Stand Character
An inventory of the marked Fort Valley Research and
Demonstration Units was started on September 14, 1998,
and completed on November 11, 1998. This work formed the
starting point for the analysis of the 16-inch cutting cap
economic impacts by providing a reliable projection on the
total amount of wood thinned in 1-inch size classes. Only a
summary of the inventory is provided here. Details and
comprehensive analysis can be found in the report by Larson
and Mirth (1999).
The tree stand condition prior to thinning is given in
table 1. The sampling technique to determine this condi-
tion consisted of counting trees and measuring tree diam-
eters over 33–1/100 acre samples per unit. This provided an
80 percent probability that the estimate of the average
total number of trees per acre per unit will fall within the
limits shown on the table.
The blackjack units, located outside the Fort Valley Ex-
perimental Forest, had been previously harvested for large
trees and had been thinned from below (Fulé and others
1999). Consequently, the inventory reflects a small percent-
age (ranging from 8.3 percent to 23 percent of the total stem
count) of existing trees in the 4-inch and under classes.
(The trees within each d.b.h class have a possible breast
height diameter that range from 0 to 0.9 inches. In example,
a 5-inch d.b.h. class could include 5-inch trees as well as
5.9 inches and any tree in between.) The majority of
existing stems are found in the 5 to 15-inch classes; ranging
from 70 to 92 percent of the total unit tree counts. The
number of existing 16-inch and larger trees is small; ac-
counting for only 3.7 percent of the overall tree population of
all three units.
The blackjack/yellow pine units are denser than the black-
jack units due to large numbers of less than 5-inch trees,
reflecting a lack of precommercial thinning in the Experi-
mental Forest. The less than 5-inch trees represent 59 to 75
percent of the total number of standing trees. These black-
jack/yellow pine units have a smaller percentage (16.6 to
31.2 percent) of 5-inch to 15-inch trees, even though the
absolute numbers are similar to that found in the blackjack
units. The blackjack/yellow pine units contain greater num-
bers of larger (16 inches and greater) trees, averaging 28.0
trees per acre (tpa).
In terms of the numbers of very small and very large trees,
the yellow pine units were similar in character to the
blackjack/yellow pine units. The population of existing trees
that was less than 5 inches accounted for 49 percent of the
trees in unit 10 to 73 percent in unit 12. The number of 16
inches and greater trees averaged 23.1 tpa.
Treatment Effects
Tables 2, 3, and 4 summarize the effects of thinning as
part of the GCFP restoration plan. The projected cutting
rate is given on a total number of trees per acre basis and on
a fiber volume basis of 100 cubic foot per acre (ccf/a).
Currently, the less than 5-inch trees cannot be economically

used as a marketable resource and, although they are part
of the tpa cut projections, they are not represented in the
merchantable fiber volumes. This very small material was
cut, scattered on the ground throughout the units, and
lopped to less than 2 ft in height.
The potential fiber harvested from these units is calcu-
lated on a diameter class basis that permits analysis of the
16-inch cutting limitation. As shown in tables 2 through 4,
had the cutting limitation been imposed on this R&D project,
it would have impacted the fiber returns from only four
(units 2, 4, 6, and 7) of the nine cutting units. On a 100 cubic
foot per acre (ccf/a) basis, the available 16 to 21.9-inch trees
represented—respectively over units 2, 4, 6, and 7—26.8,
10.0, 19.0, and 39.4 percent of the total merchantable fiber
potential.
The Cost to Treat ________________
Thinning Models
Two thinning strategies that closely replicated the pro-
cesses and equipment setups of two of the actual three
operators that performed the thinning of the Fort Valley
R&D project were modeled for this 16-inch cap analysis.
These models included:
1. Whole tree mechanized harvesting (WT):
(a) This scenario uses a mechanized system consisting
of a tracked feller-buncher, whole-tree skidders, a
delimber, and loader to process the merchantable
5-inch and greater trees.
(b) The submerchantable trees less than 5 inches d.b.h.
were hand felled, scattered, and lopped. (In this
context, lopping refers to the cutting of downed
trees and limbs that project higher than 2 ft above
the ground level.) We presumed that this precom-
mercial activity was subcontracted out to a local
sawyer operator.
2. Hand felling of all trees (HD):
(a) This scenario considers the hand cutting, limbing,
and bucking of the 5-inch and greater trees that are
then forwarded to the landing using an articulated
rubber-tired skidder with a log grapple.
(b) The merchantable activity is simultaneously accom-
panied by the cutting, scattering, and lopping of the
very small, nonmerchantable trees. This model as-
sumes that a subcontractor completes all cutting
and related processing, regardless of tree size.
The HD operation modeled here is fundamentally differ-
ent than the WT one. For comparative purposes, the HD
operation was modeled as a direct cost only operation;
neglecting overhead, profit, ancillary logging-related ex-
penses, equipment depreciation, and so forth. This is in
contrast with the WT model that incorporated all ideal
business expenses including 10 percent for profit and 11
percent for administrative overhead. Model details are
found in the paper by Larson and others (2000), or the
unpublished report by Larson and Mirth (1999).
Like the actual contracted R&D work, the different opera-
tional models were applied to the different stand types.

Stand data from units 2 and 4 (the blackjack units) were
used as input to the WT model. Units 6 and 7 data (the
blackjack/yellow pine units) were coupled to the HD model.
Because our focus is to gain insight into the 16-inch cutting
cap effects, the work presented here is limited to only those
four units (1, 4, 6, and 7) with available trees in the 16 to <
22-inch d.b.h. classes.
Results ________________________
Through the application of stand data to the appropriate
thinning models, operational cost projections are made and
summarized in tables 5 and 6. Two scenarios are presented,
allowing ready analysis of the impacts of the 16-inch cutting
cap relative to implementation costs. Scenario 1 considers
the cost implications of cutting all unmarked trees in the
merchantable d.b.h. size classes from 5 inches to less than
22 inches. The contrasting scenario 2 considers that only
trees less than 16 inches are cut.

Larson and Mirth
Projected Economic Impacts of a 16-Inch Tree Cutting Cap for Ponderosa Pine Forests Within the Greater Flagstaff Urban-Wildlands
The tabulated cost summaries are presented in three
ways:
• $/unit—the total cost to truck all merchantable fiber to
processing mills. Different mill distances were used for
the different operators, because each operator histori-
cally served different fiber users. A haul distance of 118
miles was used for the WT operator. This mileage
represents a weighted travel average, moving wood to a
once active pulp mill and to a saw log buyer. (Neither of
these purchasers exists today. The sawmill closed in
December of 1998. The paper mill converted to a 100
percent recycled product, eliminating the need for pulp-
wood.) Similarly, the HD weighted average haul dis-
tance varied between 60 to 100 miles, depending upon
the distribution of log sizes. The main purchaser of the
HD fiber was a firewood and pallet stock manufacturer
located 60 miles away, but occasionally, the HD opera-
tor would haul larger logs to a viga producer 140 miles
away.
• $/acre—an expression of the total costs including truck-
ing on a per acre basis.
• $/ccf—an expression of the total costs including truck-
ing on a per 100 cubic foot of extracted merchantable
fiber.
An examination of $/unit or $/acre data from tables 5 and
6 erroneously suggests that the imposition of a 16-inch cap
reduces cutting costs. A better context, however, for assess-
ing the cap impact is the cost per extracted fiber basis. It is
a number that can be directly compared to its revenue
potential that thereby offsets implementation costs. For
example, in unit 2, 26.8 percent of the projected extracted
fiber (on a ccf basis) comes from trees 16 inches and larger.
Upon imposition of the cutting cap, implementation costs
are shown to increase by $15.49/ccf (or 19.4 percent). Simi-
larly, unit 4 realizes an implementation cost gain of 5.0
percent associated with a 10 percent loss of potential har-
vested fiber. Unit 6 sees a 7.3 percent increase in cost due to
a 19 percent reduction in available fiber. Unit 7 realizes a 10
percent cost increase due to a 39 percent fiber reduction.
These results are consistent with the known relationship
that “logging costs per cubic foot are higher for smaller
removal volumes per acre” (Hartsough and others 1998).
The net revenue loss, however, will be larger than that
suggested by implementation cost increases as the larger
than 16-inch trees command a better selling price than the
smaller diameter trees. This revenue impact due to the 16-
inch cap is discussed further in “Revenue Expectations.”
Revenue Expectations ___________
GCFP’s ability to treat the urban-wildland forests is
highly dependent upon the local operators’ ability to profit-
ably market the harvested trees. A true picture of the
implementation economics and the impact of the 16-inch cap
is not complete without a revenue analysis that is grounded
in either historical or current market conditions.
Prior to December 1998, the WT operator sold his small
diameter logs as pulpwood (smaller diameter logs that are
suitable for use in making pulp—the main component in
paper production) and the larger logs as saw logs for cutting
into boards and lumber. As of winter 1999 when this
revenue analysis was completed, the WT operator did not
have a regular buyer of harvested wood fiber. Except for a
few truckloads of larger diameter logs sold as viga (high-
quality poles peeled from large diameter logs that are used
in Southwestern roof and ceiling architectural systems)
stock or saw logs, most of the logs from units 1, 2, and 4 were
eventually sold in late spring 1999 at a discount to Northern
Arizona Wood Products for firewood, posts, or poles.
The HD operator historically sold wood to a broad range of
markets. During winter 1999, however, the harvested logs
were sold into the firewood, pallet stock, and viga markets.
For this revenue analysis on the impact of the 16-inch
cutting cap, two market conditions were projected—a favor-
able one of pulpwood and saw logs, and a subsistence one of
firewood and pallet stock that is bolstered by a low volume
regional viga market. This analysis, however, neglects the
cost of operator down time that does occur due to oversupply
in these limited volume markets. A summary of the total net
return projections that includes revenue from the sale of
fiber, stumpage fees, thinning, and precommercial costs is
provided in tables 7, 8, 9, and 10 for the WT and HD
operators. These tables provide both a generalized sense of
the impact and also a detail analysis on a per unit basis. The
general impact trends are summarized here:
• There is a decrease in stumpage fees paid out by the
operator as there is less wood fiber harvested.
• Harvesting costs change, decreasing if presented on a
per area basis, but increasing if on a per merchantable
volume basis.
• The revenue opportunity does not change as a function
of cutting restrictions within the small diameter prod-
uct categories, but decreases significantly in the larger
diameter products. As a consequence, the net returns to
the operator(s) are likewise severely impacted.
• The large diameter products subsidize the lower value
small diameter products. This bolstering is particularly
important to the operators selling fiber within a subsis-
tence market where the main opportunity for small
diameter logs is a very low value product.
Table 7 summarizes the financial impacts of the 16-inch
cap for the WT operator under a market condition that is
considered favorable (albeit currently nonexistent for opera-
tors in the Flagstaff area) as the small diameter wood is sold
at a relatively high price as pulpwood. The projected impact
of a cutting cap to the operator is net return reductions of
96.8 percent over unit 2 and 22.3 percent over unit 4. Recall
that the WT thinning model included profit, overhead, and
other reasonable business expenses. Because of this, and
because net returns were always positive, the modeled WT
operator could tolerate the 16-inch cap in a market that pays
a reasonable price for small diameter wood.
This is not the case, however, for the WT operator in a
marginal market of firewood, pallet stock, and vigas as
shown in table 8. The projected impact of a cutting cap is
quantified in terms of net return reductions of 176.2 per-
cent over unit 2 and 58.8 percent over unit 4. Table 8
suggests that the modeled WT operator could not afford the
16-inch cap in a low-value small-diameter market with a
negative net return that completely cancels any profit
opportunities.

Tables 9 and 10 show a similar impact trend for the direct
cost HD model as that seen for the full cost WT model. In a
favorable market, the cutting cap reduces projected returns
by 86.1 percent over unit 6 and 57.2 percent over unit 7. In
the subsistence market, the reductions are, respectively,
162.5 percent and 83.8 percent over units 6 and 7. These
reductions, however, are particularly severe in the subsis-
tence market for this direct cost model excludes overhead,
profit, depreciation, insurance, opportunity loss, mobiliza-
tion, and roadwork. The cutting cap moves the operator from
an adequate financial situation to a losing one where he
cannot finance the indirect operational costs.

The quality of the fiber market is an important variable on
the overall impact of a cutting cap. A favorable regional
market that can pay a reasonable price for small diameter
logs—distinguished by higher value products such as pulp
for paper products, oriented strand board, or medium or high
density fiber board—is one that might support a cutting cap.
A subsistence market—distinguished by low value products
such as firewood, pallets, or arts and crafts—cannot with
current thinning technologies and administrative proce-
dures support the cap. A comparison of “with cap mill
revenues” between tables 7 and 8 and between tables 8 and
9 readily demonstrates this market quality factor. The
subsistence market yields gross revenues that are 73.4 to
83.2 percent of what the favorable market is projected to
provide. This is roughly comparable to the difference in
small diameter fiber price between the low-value use versus
the higher value use.
Conclusions____________________
The results presented in this paper were developed by
simulating a cutting cap over various models built from a
representative forest restoration project, the Fort Valley
R&D Project, that involved the thinning of trees that were
less than 22 inches d.b.h. This simulation work suggests the
following:
• The cost to conduct a forest thinning program to reduce
the risk of catastrophic fire and restore forest ecosystem
health is substantial.
• Establishing a cap that prohibits the cutting of 16
inches d.b.h. and greater has a negative effect on the
economics of a forest thinning project.
• The number of 16- to 21.9-inch trees available for
cutting in the original Fort Valley R&D Project repre-
sents only a small percentage of the standing large
trees. However, these trees represent a disproportion-
ately large percent of the total volume to be cut with
profound effects on project economics.
• The economic effect of the 16-inch cap is related to the
health of the regional wood fiber market. A healthy
market with several users that pay fair prices can
support a forest restoration program even with a cap. A
weak, limited market for wood fiber probably cannot
support the operators, if a cap is imposed.
• This study suggests that a healthy market is one that
can pay, on a weighted average, between $70/ccf to $95/
ccf within a 100 mile haul radius.
