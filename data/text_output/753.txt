In ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.)
forests of the Southwest, ecological restoration
treatments have been initiated that include
thinning dense stands of young trees and apply-
ing low-intensity fire (Covington and Moore
1994, Covington et al. 1997, Moore et al. 1999).
Although reestablishment of ecological func-
tion is theorized to flow from overstory struc-
tural manipulation and the reintroduction of
surface fire, ecological interactions, particu-
larly between arthropods and understory plant
hosts, have been minimally researched.
In 1999 I began a study to examine various
factors affecting regeneration of Ceanothus
fendleri Gray in areas undergoing ecological
restoration treatments. Ceanothus fendleri is a
shrub common in the understory of ponderosa
pine forests in the Southwest. It is a preferred
browse of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus
hemionus Rafinesque; Urness et al. 1975), a
nitrogen fixer (Story 1974), and a provider 
of structural heterogeneity in predominantly
grassy and herbaceous understory communi-
ties. Resprouting of C. fendleri after distur-
bances such as fire is common (Pearson et al.
1972, Ffolliott et al. 1977, Vose and White
1991). Its seeds are forcibly ejected from de-
hiscing capsules and likely remain in forest
floor seed banks for years until stimulated by
heat from fire to germinate (Kearney and Pee-
bles 1951, Reed 1974, Krishnan 1989). Large
ungulate use of understory forage can increase
after forest thinning (Patton 1974), and her-
bivory on C. fendleri can be intense and con-
strain flower and fruit production (Huffman
and Moore in preparation). Other factors that
likely affect C. fendleri regeneration and vary
with forest condition include seed predation
and parasitism.
Prior to this study, rates of seed parasitism
and predation had not been reported for C.
fendleri, although nearly complete predispersal
consumption of seed crops by invertebrates
has been reported for overstory ponderosa
pine (Blake et al. 1985). The objectives of my
research were to (1) collect preliminary data
on predispersal seed parasitism for Ceanothus
fendleri in areas thinned for ecological restora-
tion objectives and (2) identify common insect
species infesting C. fendleri seeds. Information
concerning processes that affect ovule and
seed fate can help resource managers predict
rates of ecological recovery in communities
undergoing restoration treatments.
METHODS
The study was conducted from 1999 to
2000 on the Fort Valley Experimental Forest
(latitude 35°16′N, longitude 111°41′W) in
Coconino County approximately 10 km north-
west of Flagstaff, Arizona. The site is approxi-
mately 2300 m above mean sea level and has
flat to gently rolling topography with slopes

A SEED CHALCID (EURYTOMA SQUAMOSA BUGBEE) PARASITIZES
BUCKBRUSH (CEANOTHUS FENDLERI GRAY) SEEDS
IN A PONDEROSA PINE FOREST OF ARIZONA
David W. Huffman1
ABSTRACT.—Predispersal seed parasitism rates were quantified for buckbrush (Ceanothus fendleri Gray) in 3 Arizona
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forest units that had been thinned for ecological restoration objectives. The
chalcidoid wasp Eurytoma squamosa Bugbee (Eurytomidae) was responsible for 35% of total seed loss in a single year.
These findings represent an expansion of the known range and host list for E. squamosa and increase our understanding
of factors that may constrain regeneration of C. fendleri in Southwest ponderosa pine forests.
Key words: predispersal seed predation, range expansion, Hymenoptera, Eurytoma squamosa, Ceanothus fendleri,
ecological restoration, plant-insect interactions, parasitism.

generally less than 20%. Annual precipitation
averages 52 cm, of which approximately half
falls as snow in late winter. Soils are moder-
ately well drained and classified as Brolliar
stony clay loam (Meurisse 1971) developed
from tertiary basalt parent material.
Overstory vegetation is nearly pure pon-
derosa pine with scattered occurrence of
Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.). Com-
mon understory species include bunchgrasses
Festuca arizonica Vasey, Muhlenbergia montana
(Nutt.) A.S. Hitchc., Elymus elymoides (Raf.)
Swezey, and Blepharoneuron tricholepis (Torr.)
Nash; forbs Lupinus spp., Erigergon spp., Eri-
gonium spp., Achillea millifolium L., and Anten-
naria spp.; and woody shrubs Ceanothus fend-
leri and Rosa woodsii Lindl.
Large mammalian herbivores present on
the site are mule deer and elk (Cervus elaphus
Linnaeus). Livestock were excluded from the
study site.
Overstory trees were thinned in February
1999, which reduced tree density in three 15-ha
experimental forest restoration units to approx-
imately 111–120 trees per hectare. In May
1999, I established 60 plots (4 m2 in size) cen-
tered on Ceanothus fendleri shrubs in each of
the 3 restoration units (180 shrub plots total).
Ceanothus fendleri plants on these plots pro-
duced no fruit in 1999. Therefore, I collected
seeds from C. fendleri shrubs growing on
microsites adjacent to the restoration units and
monitored parasite emergence from these seeds
until June 2001. Adult parasites emerging were
captured and immediately preserved in 70%
isopropyl alcohol. Specimens were sent to Dr.
Robert Zuparko at the California Academy of
Science (CAS), San Francisco, California, USA,
and to the USDA Systematic Entomology Lab-
oratory (SEL; specimens identified by E. Eric
Grissell, Research Entomologist), Bethesda,
Maryland, USA, for identification.
Fruit developed on 11 total C. fendleri plots
in July 2000. To capture seeds as fruits dehisced,
I installed seed traps constructed from bridal
veil material (mesh size <2 mm) tied around
fruiting stems. Twenty-three traps were installed
on 1 to 5 stems per plot and each enclosed 1 to
14 fruits.
Seeds collected from traps were separated
from plant debris and counted in the labora-
tory. Seeds were classified as “developed” or
“undeveloped.” Developed seeds were approx-
imately 2 mm in diameter, had smooth, full
seed coats, and were glossy brown in appear-
ance (Fig. 1a). In contrast, undeveloped seeds
were typically smaller than 2 mm and flat-
tened; additionally, they had wrinkled, yellow-
ish seed coats (Fig. 1b). Seeds were examined
under a dissecting scope (10–20X) for parasite
emergence holes or other signs of infestation
and then dissected to determine embryo con-
dition and presence of parasite larvae/pupae.
RESULTS
Parasite specimens collected as they emerged
from 1999 seeds were all from a single chalci-
doid wasp species, Eurytoma squamosa Bug-
bee (Eurytomidae; Figs. 1c–d). Although emer-
gence was not specifically studied, I observed
adult wasps emerging up to 20 months after
the 1999 seed collection.
A total of 144 seeds were recovered in 2000
from traps installed on C. fendleri fruiting
stems. Each trap yielded 1 to 24 seeds. Fifty
percent of the seeds captured were undevel-
oped (Table 1), and in these seeds no parasite
larvae or signs of infestation were found.
Parasitism was responsible for 35% of the
total seed loss and 71% of the loss of devel-
oped seeds (Table 1). No clear trends were ob-
served for rate of parasitism and number of
seeds per trap or seeds per plot. Parasite emer-
gence holes in developed seeds were approxi-
mately 0.5 mm in diameter (Fig. 1e). Embryonic
tissue of seeds with emergence holes was com-
pletely consumed, leaving the seeds hollow.
Seeds housing parasite larvae showed no
external signs of infestation. Emergence hole
appearance (i.e., size and shape) was consis-
tent between seeds trapped in 2000 and those
collected in 1999. Likewise, characteristics of
larvae within dissected seeds of both collec-
tions were consistent. We found no evidence
of other parasitic species associated with C.
fendleri seeds.
The majority of developed seeds that had
not been parasitized were filled with appar-
ently healthy embryos (Fig. 1f, Table 1). How-
ever, approximately 3% of these showed no signs
of parasitism but were hollow nonetheless.
DISCUSSION
These results represent an expansion of the
known range and host list for Eurytoma squa-
mosa. Prior to this study, this wasp species was
not known to occur in Arizona or on Ceanothus

fendleri. Occurrence of the species has been
reported in Idaho, Washington, and Califor-
nia, USA (Bugbee 1967). In these states its
hosts are other species of Ceanothus including
C. divaricatus, C. thyraiflorus, C. cordulatus,
C. velutinus, and C. sanguineus. For C. san-
guineus in Idaho, E. squamosa and 2 other
phytophagous insects were responsible for an
average loss of 9–27% of total seeds in fruits
over a 3-year period (Furniss et al. 1978).
Another Eurytoma species (E. greggii Bugbee)
has been reported to infest >80% of the seeds
of Ceanothus greggii Gray in chaparral ecosys-
tems of Arizona (Bugbee 1971). Seed chalcids
are well-known parasites of seeds of commer-
cial tree species such as ponderosa pine in

northern Arizona (e.g., Blake et al. 1985), but
little research has quantified parasitism on
understory plants.
With the data presented here, long-term
effects of seed parasitism on Ceanothus fend-
leri regeneration are difficult to determine.
Traits such as innate dormancy suggest that C.
fendleri utilizes a seed bank strategy similar to
congeneric species (Quick 1935, Reed 1974,
Conard et al. 1985, Krishnan 1989). However,
resprouting after disturbance is also common
(Ffolliott et al. 1977, Vose and White 1991).
Thus, although my data suggest that E. squa-
mosa constrained replenishment of seeds in
soil seed banks, temporal patterns of seed par-
asitism and the relative importance of sprout-
ing versus seedling recruitment for C. fendleri
persistence are not yet clear.
Presettlement characteristics of C. fendleri–
E. squamosa interactions are not known. Plausi-
bly, frequent surface fires common in ponder-
osa pine forests prior to Anglo and Hispanic
settlement of northern Arizona (ca 1876; Fulé
et al. 1997) could have functioned to control
larval populations of E. squamosa in dispersed
seeds. Fires heating C. fendleri seeds in soil
seed banks may have caused wasp mortality
while stimulating seed germination. Thus, future
research could address questions related to
fire or heat effects on parasite and seed sur-
vival and seed germination. Studies illuminat-
ing presettlement conditions with respect to
plant–insect interactions could help ecologists
and land managers expand their understand-
ing of ecosystem dynamics and, in turn, make
informed decisions concerning forest restora-
tion and management.
