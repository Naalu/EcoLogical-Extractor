Fire regime in a conservation reserve in
Chihuahua, Mexico
Peter Z. Fulé, José Villanueva-Díaz, and Mauro Ramos-Gómez
Abstract: Fire regime characteristics were reconstructed from fire-scarred trees in the Tutuaca reserve, a newly desig-
nated protected area in the Sierra Madre Occidental of western Chihuahua. The reserve was created to protect thick-
billed parrot nesting habitat (large snags) and a relict forest of Chihuahua spruce (Picea chihuahuana Martínez). We
collected fire-scarred samples from conifers (Pinus ayacahuite Ehrenb., Pinus durangensis Martínez, and Pseudotsuga
menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) in three 25-ha sites arrayed at different watershed positions, from a low site adjacent to the
spruce trees up to the watershed divide. Fire analysis periods began in 1702, 1704, or 1761 and continued through the
final fire in 1955 (two sites) or 1995. All sites had frequent fire regimes (mean fire interval (MFI) 3.9–5.2 years; MFI
for years in which 25% or more of the samples were scarred: 6.9–8.4 years). Almost all fires occurred before cambial
growth began or early during the season of cambial growth. Fire years were significantly dry, and the years immediately
preceding fire were significantly wet. After 1955, no further fires occurred at two of the three study sites, a pattern
similar to that observed elsewhere in northern Mexico. The third site had fires in 1987 and 1995. The extended fire-
free period in portions of the Tutuaca landscape may result in fuel accumulation and eventually in severe wildfire. For
effective conservation of fire-susceptible habitat features, managers should seek to incorporate surface fire as a manage-
ment tool.
Résumé : Les caractéristiques du régime des feux ont été reconstituées à partir des arbres portant des cicatrices de feu
dans la réserve de Tutuaca, une nouvelle aire protégée dans la Sierra Madre occidentale de l’ouest de l’État de Chihua-
hua. La réserve a été créée pour protéger l’habitat de nidification (chicots de forte dimension) de la conure à gros bec
ainsi qu’une forêt ancienne d’épinette de Chihuahua (Picea chihuahuana Martínez). Les auteurs ont collecté des échan-
tillons de cicatrices de feu chez des conifères (Pinus ayacahuite Ehrenb., Pinus durangensis Martínez et Pseudotsuga
menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) dans trois sites de 25 ha établis dans différentes parties d’un bassin versant; allant d’un site
situé au bas, adjacent aux épinettes, jusqu’à la ligne de partage des eaux. La période d’analyse des feux a débuté en
1702, 1704 ou 1761 et continué jusqu’au dernier feu en 1955 (deux sites) ou 1995. Les feux étaient fréquents dans
tous les sites (l’intervalle moyen entre les feux est de 3,9 à 5,2 ans; l’intervalle moyen entre les feux où 25 % ou plus
des échantillons portaient des cicatrices de feu est de 6,9 à 8,4 ans). Presque tous les feux sont survenus avant que dé-
bute la croissance du cambium ou tôt dans la saison de croissance du cambium. Les années où il y a eu des feux ont
été particulièrement sèches et celles qui ont immédiatement précédé ces années ont été particulièrement humides. Après
1955, aucun autre feu n’est survenu dans deux des trois sites étudiés, une situation qui a été observée ailleurs dans le
nord du Mexique. Le troisième site a subi des feux en 1987 et 1995. La longue période sans feux dans des portions du
paysage de Tutuaca pourrait entraîner l’accumulation de combustibles et éventuellement de sévères feux de forêt. Les
aménagistes devraient chercher à incorporer le brûlage dirigé comme outil d’aménagement pour réussir à conserver les
caractéristiques des habitats sensibles au feu.

Introduction
The Sierra Madre Occidental, the mountain range that
stretches from central Mexico to the southwestern United
States, supports ecosystems of extraordinary biological di-
versity (Rzedowski 1992; Bye 1995). The mountains repeatedly
served as glacial refugia and migration corridors (Axelrod
1986); remnants from the most recent cold epoch still persist
in the form of rare relict forests of Chihuahua spruce (Picea
chiahuahuana Martínez) (Ledig et al. 2000). Though humans
have lived in the Sierra Madre Occidental for thousands of
years, the impacts of roads, livestock, and industrial-scale
logging only became widespread in the mid-20th century.
But by 1996, Lammertink and coworkers found that old-growth

forests persisted only in isolated fragments representing <1%
of the landscape. Fire and other disturbances, logging, over-
grazing, overhunting, erosion, population growth, have lead
to identification of these regions as a critical conservation
priority (Biodiversity Support Program 1995; Consejo Nacional
para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad 2002).
Fire ecology has been little studied in northern Mexico,
but changes in fire regimes have been quantified at a few
sites in the Sierra Madre Occidental (Fulé and Covington
1997, 1999; Kaib 1998; Swetnam et al. 2001; Heyerdahl and
Alvarado 2003). These forests had frequent surface fire re-
gimes, in some cases continuing up to the present. At most
sites, however, fire regimes were disrupted in the mid-20th
century, and forests entered extended fire-free periods, pri-
marily because of heavy livestock grazing. Fire exclusion
can threaten forest sustainability, because accumulated fuels
can support uncharacteristically severe wildfires. Recent 40-
to 70-year periods of fire exclusion in the Sierra Madre Oc-
cidental were associated with increased tree regeneration and
tree density, changes in species composition and tree spatial
patterns, and forest floor fuel buildup (Fulé and Covington
1994; Fulé et al. 2000). Two such sites recently burned with
high-intensity fires (Fulé and Covington 1998; Fulé et al.
2000), a distinct change from predisruption fire behavior, al-
tering or even supplanting natural successional trajectories
(Romme et al. 1999). Severe fires killed many or all overstory
trees, exposed soils to erosion, and altered successional path-
ways to favor sprouting species and shrubs (Fulé et al. 2000;
Barton 2002).
The Tutuaca reserve, established in pine–oak forests in
western Chihuahua in 2000, is a prototype of a new ap-
proach to forest protection. Rather than a government-funded
National Park or Biosphere Reserve (e.g., Halffter 1978), the
Tutuaca reserve was created through a civil agreement to de-
fer timber harvesting and manage for long-term conserva-
tion; landowners were compensated with funds contributed
by several nongovernmental organizations (Enkerlin-Hoeflich
2000). Two critical ecosystem elements protected at Tutuaca
are vulnerable to fire: the large old snags that serve as nest
sites for thick-billed parrots and a relict Chihuahua spruce
forest.
We selected a watershed of pine–Douglas-fir forest in the
center of the Tutuaca reserve, next to the relict spruce stand,
as a study area to answer the following questions: (1) What
were the characteristics of the past fire regime (fire fre-
quency, seasonality, synchrony) across sites located in differ-
ent watershed positions and elevations? We expected fires to
move readily up the drainage, but that the site at the top of
the watershed would capture additional fires burning up
from the adjacent watershed. (2) Have fire patterns changed,
especially through recent fire exclusion? (3) What is the
strength and pattern of the influence of climate on fire?
Finally, we sought to suggest ways in which this information
could be applied to management for long-term conservation
of the reserve.
Materials and methods
Study area
The study sites were located within the Tutuaca Natural
Protected Area, also referred to as “Cebadillas” or “Bisaloachic”.
The reserve is located in the Sierra Madre Occidental in
Municipio
Temosachic,
western
Chihuahua
(28°39′N,
108°17′W). Soils are of volcanic origin with parent materials
of rhyolite and pyroclastic rock, shallow, and rocky except
in
valley
bottoms
(Instituto
Nacional
de
Estadística,
Geografía, e Informática 1999). Climate was classified as
temperate, semicold, subhumid climate with summer rains
(Dirección General de Geografia del Territorio Nacional 1981).
Dominant tree species include Pinus durangensis Martínez,
Pinus ayacahuite Ehrenb., Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)
Franco, Quercus spp., and Arbutus spp.
The Tutuaca reserve was selected from among the few areas
identified by Lammertink et al. (1996) and field surveys as an
active breeding site for the endangered thick-billed parrot or
guacamaya (Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha) (Monterrubio-Rico
and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004). It includes the key nesting site
for an international partnership between the Species Survival
Plan Management Group in the United States, and several
institutions in Mexico (Lamberski and Healy 2002). The
land is owned by two “ejidos”, civil organizations with com-
munal land tenure, the ejidos Tutuaca and Conoachic. The
forest has been selectively harvested in the past, but the area
retains more large trees and large snags than most Madrean
forests. A relict stand of Chihuahua spruce, also an endan-
gered species, is located along the bottom and northeast-facing
slopes of Arroyo Piceas in the Tutuaca reserve. By creating
the reserve, conservationists hoped to protect these habitats
and eventually develop a nonconsumptive economy supported
by ecotourism and scientific studies.
We established three fire scar sampling sites on the north
slope of the Arroyo Piceas to characterize fire regimes in the
vicinity of the spruce forest. Each site was 25 ha in size, to
have a common basis of sampled area for consistent compar-
isons (Falk and Swetnam 2003), and the sites represented a
range in elevation and slope position (Table 1). The LOW
site was at the bottom of the drainage and next to a forest
road. The HIGH site was located on steep slopes at the top
of the drainage, adjacent to the TOP site, which lay atop the
watershed divide.
Field and laboratory methods
Fire-scarred tree sampling was done in August 2003. Each
study site was thoroughly searched for fire-scarred trees.
Partial cross-sections were cut from scarred “catfaces” on
trees, snags, logs, and stumps of conifers apparently contain-
ing the oldest and (or) most extensive fire records. Samples
from living trees were collected as partial cross-sections, a
method that does not require felling the tree and that rarely
causes lasting damage to large pine trees, such as those we
sampled (Heyerdahl and McKay 2001). Samples were mapped
when collected and were well distributed throughout the
study sites (Fig. 1). Characteristics of the sampled trees are
summarized in Table 2.
In the lab, samples were mounted and surfaced until cell
structure could be seen clearly under a microscope. Samples
were crossdated (Stokes and Smiley 1968) using characteristic
patterns of narrow marker years. A master tree-ring chronol-
ogy developed in Bisaloachic (Tutuaca) was also used in
crossdating (J. Villanueva-Diaz, unpublished data). After ini-
tial dating, ring widths of all samples were measured to
check dating with the Cofecha program (Holmes 1983). The

season of fire occurrence (Baisan and Swetnam 1990) was
estimated based on the relative position of each fire lesion
within the annual ring according to the following categories:
early earlywood, middle earlywood, late earlywood, latewood,
and dormant. Dormant season scars were assigned to the
year of the following earlywood (i.e., spring fires), a convention
that appears valid for the spring drought – summer monsoonal
climate pattern of northern Mexico (Fulé and Covington 1997,
1999; Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003). The season was listed
as “not determined” when it could not be distinguished clearly.
Fire history data were analyzed with the FHX2 software
(Grissino-Mayer 2001). Analysis at each site began with the

first year with an adequate sample depth (Grissino-Mayer et
al. 1994), defined as the first fire year recorded by 10% or
more of the total sample size of recording trees at each site.
“Recording” trees are those with open fire scars or other inju-
ries (e.g., lightning scars), leaving them susceptible to repeated
scarring by fire (Swetnam and Baisan 1996). Beginning dates
were 1761 (LOW), 1702 (HIGH), and 1704 (TOP). A com-
mon fire-history end-date of 2003 was used.
Fire-return intervals were analyzed statistically in differ-
ent subcategories or “filters”. First, the statistical distribution
of fire intervals using all fire years, even those represented
by a single scar, was assessed. Then only those fire years
were included in which, respectively, 10% or more, and 25%
or more, of the recording samples were scarred. In contrast
with the all-scarred category, these filters capture fires that
were relatively larger and (or) more intense than those fires
that scarred only one or a few trees (Swetnam and Baisan
1996, 2003). The 25% scarred category has been shown to
agree relatively closely with point-based fire interval analy-
sis (Baker and Ehle 2001), perhaps better reflecting the eco-
logical impact of the fire regime at any given point within a
study area. The statistical analysis of fire-return intervals in-
cluded the minimum, maximum, and mean fire intervals (MFI,
average number of years between fires) and the Weibull me-
dian probability interval (WMPI), used to model asymmetric
fire interval distributions and to express fire-return intervals
in probabilistic terms (Grissino-Mayer 1999). After assess-
ing each study site individually, all the data were combined,
and the complete distribution of fire-return intervals was de-
scribed using the same three filters: all scars, 10% scarred,
and 25% scarred.
The relationship between climatic fluctuations and fire oc-
currence was evaluated with superposed epoch analysis, us-
ing software developed by Grissino-Mayer (2001). A locally
developed Douglas-fir tree-ring chronology served as a proxy
for climate. The residual earlywood chronology explained
51% of the winter–spring (October–May) precipitation vari-
ance of climatic stations for northwestern Chihuahua and
northeastern Sonora for the period 1950–1990. The precipi-
tation reconstruction covers the 1472–2002 period and shows
the presence of extreme droughts, especially in the 1860s,
1550s, and 1490s (J. Villanueva-Diaz, unpublished data).

within the scarred ring.

The power spectrum for the reconstructed precipitation indicated
a significant variance concentration at 4 years, which is re-
lated to the warm phase of the El Niño - Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) influence on this part of Mexico (Stahle et al. 1998).
In the superposed epoch analysis, the climate values in all
fire years (81 fire events) were averaged and compared with
the average climate values in a window of 5 preceding and 2
succeeding years. Bootstrapped distributions of climate data in
1000 random windows were used to create confidence intervals.
Results
We collected a total of 93 fire-scarred samples, 79 of
which were crossdated and used for analysis (Table 2). Nearly
two-thirds of the samples were collected from dead trees,
mostly downed logs and stumps. Most samples were from
Pinus durangensis, some from Pinus ayacahuite and
Pseudotsuga menziesii. There was little difference in aver-
age sample tree diameter between sites, with an overall aver-
age of 44.8 cm.
A total of 724 fire scars was dated, and the season of fire
occurrence was estimated on 58% of the scars (Table 3).
Dormant-season scarring was the most common (47% overall).
Early-earlywood and middle-earlywood scarring occurred nearly
equally, representing 25% and 26% of the fire scars, respec-
tively. Fewer than 2% of the scars occurred in the late early-
wood and none were found in latewood.
Fires were frequent at all three sites from the onset of ade-
quate sample depth (Fig. 2) through the mid-20th century
(Fig. 3). Although each site contained sample trees predating
1600 A.D., with the earliest fire date in 1572, adequate sam-
ple depth for statistical analysis was only reached in 1702
and 1704 at the HIGH and TOP sites and not until 1761 at the
LOW site. Fires recurred at mean intervals of 3.9–4.5 years,
using all scars (Table 4). The filtered fire scar data, using the
25% scarred criterion, averaged 1.5–2.2 times longer, with
MFI values ranging from 6.9 to 8.4 years. Weibull median
probability interval (WMPI) values were very similar to MFI
values; the greatest discrepancy at any site or filter category
was a 1.0-year difference. All sites had a minimum of only
1 year between fires, but fire-free maxima ranged from 10 to
22 years (all scars) or 20 to 39 years (25% scarred). The av-
erage per-sample fire intervals (or “point” fire intervals; Baker
and Ehle 2001) were roughly twice as long as the 25%
scarred MFI, ranging from 13.8 to 15.2 years.
In ponderosa pine forests, Baker and Ehle (2001) sug-
gested that the interval between the tree pith and the first
scar should be considered a true fire-free interval, analyzed
in the same manner as the intervals between subsequent
scars on a recording sample. This concept is not widely ac-
cepted (for discussion, see Fulé et al. 2003; Stephens et al.
2003; Swetnam and Baisan 2003), but the data on pith to
first-scar intervals are presented here to contribute to the
minimal existing data on this topic. Twenty-one of the 79
crossdated samples (27%) included the tree pith. The average

interval from pith to the first recorded scar was 52.3 years,
minimum 9 years, maximum 138 years. Eleven of the 21
samples had pith to first-scar intervals <50 years, ranging
from 9 to 46 years.
Fire events were commonly recorded on numerous sam-
ples, leading to the relatively small difference between the
all-scar MFI and the 25% scarred MFI. In addition, fires
were often synchronous across sites (Fig. 3). Since there
were relatively few fire dates that did not appear in all sites,
the MFI for ALL sites, shown in the lower section of Table 4,
was only slightly lower than the individual-site MFI values:
3.1-year all-scar MFI and 7.6-year 25% scarred MFI. Thus
the fire history of the entire study area, 75 ha, was very sim-
ilar to the fire histories of each individual 25-ha site.
Unique fire dates were assessed by comparing fire events
between sites. Of the 63 fire dates in the period 1761–1955,
30 fires (48%) were recorded at all three sites. The LOW
and TOP sites each had 8 unique fire dates, each represent-
ing 13% of the total number of events. No unique fire dates
were found at the HIGH site. Three fires (5%) burned only
at the LOW + HIGH sites, 12 fires (19%) burned only at the
HIGH + TOP sites, and 2 fire dates (3%) were recorded only
at the LOW + TOP sites.
The pattern of frequent, synchronous fires was broken in
the mid-20th century. All three sites burned in 1945, fol-
lowed by a 10-year fire-free gap and another synchronous
fire in 1955. No fires were recorded in the HIGH or TOP
sites after 1955, creating a 48-year interval (1955–2003) that is
approximately 1.8–4.8 times longer than any previous fire-free
period since the beginning of the 18th century. In contrast, a
fire at the LOW site in 1987 scarred two-thirds of the sample
trees, and another fire in 1995 scarred 2 trees. The longest
fire-free period at the LOW site was 32 years (1955–1987),
and the interval since the most recent fire was only 7 years
(1995–2003).
Fire years were significantly dry (<99% confidence inter-
val), as shown by superposed epoch analysis (Fig. 4). The
years immediately preceding fire were also significantly wet
(>90% confidence interval). Eight fire years coincided with
positive extremes of the Southern Oscillation Index, as re-
constructed from tree rings in the Sierra Madre Occidental
by Stahle and Cleaveland (1993), indicating cool, dry condi-
tions. In six of these years, fires occurred at all the three
sites (1801, 1862, 1904, 1909, 1921, 1925). In 1805, fire oc-

Note: Analysis was carried out from the first fire date with a depth of recording samples of 10% of total sample size, until the final fire date. All three
sites recorded fires in 1955; thereafter only the LOW site recorded fires. Statistical analysis was carried out in three categories: (1) all fire years, including
those represented by a single fire scar; (2) fire years in which 10% or more of the recording sample trees were scarred; and (3) fire years in which 25%
or more of the recording sample trees were scarred. MFI, mean fire interval.

corded only at the TOP site. Only one fire event occurred in
a year with a negative Southern Oscillation extreme (warm,
moist conditions; Stahle and Cleaveland 1993): 1844, when
a fire occurred at the TOP site.
Discussion
Fire frequency and spread
Surface fires recurred frequently in the Arroyo Piceas and
adjacent
watershed.
The
MFI
values
and
minimum–
maximum fire intervals at the Tutuaca reserve were similar
to fire regime characteristics across several other sites in the
Sierra Madre Occidental (Fulé and Covington 1997, 1999;
Kaib 1998; Swetnam et al. 2001; Heyerdahl and Alvarado
2003) and elsewhere in the greater Southwest, defined as the
southwestern
United
States,
and
northwestern
Mexico
(Stephens et al. 2003; Swetnam and Baisan 2003). Fires ap-
peared to have spread readily across all three study sites in
most years, as shown by the fact that there was little differ-
ence (generally <1 year) between the MFI values at any indi-
vidual site (25 ha each) versus the MFI calculated for all
sites together (75 ha). Although fires were relatively syn-
chronous, with nearly 50% of fire dates recorded at all three
sites, the TOP site did not reflect an unusual number of
unique dates, even though its position at the watershed di-
vide would seem to be suitable for importing fires from two
drainages. Because the LOW site had an equal number of
unique dates as the TOP site (8 fires), we interpret the overall
pattern as approximately one-half large synchronous fires
and one-half smaller fires, apparently affecting all the water-
shed positions in similar ways.
Fire regime disruption
All three Tutuaca sites showed a change in fire frequency
after 1955, with fire ceasing entirely at two sites. Throughout
western North America, frequent-fire regimes in long-needled
pine forests have been interrupted by extended fire exclusion,
beginning in the 19th century in the southwestern United
States (Swetnam and Baisan 2003), and extending to north-
western Mexico by the mid-20th century. Heyerdahl and
Alvarado (2003) found MFI <4 years and fire cessation be-
ginning around 1950 at Salsipuedes (Ejido Largo). This site
is the only previously published fire history from Chihuahua,
near Madera, approximately 100 km north of the Tutuaca
study area (Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003). At three sites in
the Sierra de los Ajos, Sonora, Dieterich (1983) and
Swetnam et al. (2001) reported MFI values of 4.0–5.9 years
(all scars), increasing to 5.9–9.6 years for the 25% scarred
distribution. The onset of fire exclusion crossed a range of
dates in the Ajos, from 1916 to 1972. In the Sierra San
Pedro Mártir, Baja California, MFI values ranged from 3.9
to 9.2 years in the 1700s and 1800s (all scars), from 9.6 to
22 years (25% scarred); widespread fires ceased after 1946,
although a few individual trees were scarred in apparently
small fires thereafter (Stephens et al. 2003). Further south in
Durango, seven sites studied by Heyerdahl and Alvarado
(2003) and nine sites studied by Fulé and Covington (1997,
1999) displayed strikingly similar MFI values (almost all
within 3–6 years) but a broad range of fire exclusion dates.
Four sites ceased burning in the 1930s, three in the 1940s,
two in the 1950s, two in the 1970s–1980s, and surface fires es-
sentially continued up to the present at the remaining five
sites.
The primary reason for fire exclusion in northern Mexico
is believed to be land-use change, especially increased live-
stock grazing, associated with land redistribution following
the Mexican Revolution. Heyerdahl and Alvarado (2003)
graphically illustrated the juxtaposition of widespread grants
of land for ejidos with steep decline in sites with fires be-
tween 1930 and 1960. Historical records document increased
grazing coincident with fire exclusion at both the Sierra San
Pedro Mártir in Baja California (Stephens et al. 2003) and
La Michilía Biosphere Reserve in Durango (Fulé and
Covington 1999). Even in the United States, where active
fire suppression has played a greater role than in Mexico in
eliminating fire (Rodríguez-Trejo and Sierra-Pineda 1992),
fire exclusion associated with grazing began as early as the
1820s in Arizona (Savage and Swetnam 1990).
Fire and climate
Fire years were significantly dry, as reflected in the super-
posed epoch analysis and the correspondence with the dry
phase of ENSO, but the years immediately before fires were
significantly wet. Observing the same phenomenon in the
southwestern United States, Swetnam and Baisan (2003)
suggested that fire spread was favored when a dry year fol-
lowed a moist year, with high fine fuel production. A similar
mechanism is possible at Tutuaca, where perennial grasses
were the predominant understory vegetation. Northern Mex-
ico is strongly affected by the ENSO climate pattern (Stahle
and Cleaveland 1993; Stahle et al. 1998; Villanueva-Díaz
and McPherson 2002), and fire occurrence in northern Mexico
has been linked to ENSO (Fulé and Covington 1997, 1999;
Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003; Stephens et al. 2003), as in
the southwestern United States (Swetnam and Betancourt
1998) and southern South America (Kitzberger et al. 2001).
Extreme fire weather conditions were associated with El
Niño in 1998 in central and southern Mexico, when nearly
600 000 ha burned in uncontrollable wildfires (Rodríguez-
Trejo and Pyne 1998).
In much of the greater Southwest (southestern United States,
and northwestern Mexico) and in southern South America,
fire frequency was reduced in a period from the late eigh-
teenth to the early nineteenth centuries (LEENT, roughly
1790–1830) (Grissino-Mayer and Swetnam 2000; Stephens
et al. 2003). This reduction may be related to low-frequency
changes in ENSO variability (Kitzberger and Veblen 2003)
that resulted in a decrease in Southern Oscillation Index ex-
tremes in the Sierra Madre Occidental (Stahle and Cleaveland
1993). For example, in northern Baja California, the fire re-
gime appeared to change from one of relatively frequent but
patchy fires before 1790, to an extended gap that was nearly
fire-free till around 1830, followed by less frequent but
widespread fires until the mid-19th century (Stephens et al.
2003). In contrast, at Tutuaca there is no evidence of a gap
in fire occurrence in LEENT (Fig. 3). However, fires did be-
come highly synchronous beginning about 66 years later in
the record: from 1896 to 1955, every fire date was recorded
at every site. No obvious gap or change in synchrony around
LEENT is evident in the small number of fire histories from
Chihuahua and Durango (Fulé and Covington 1997, 1999;

Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003), though few sites have adequate
sampling depth before 1800. It would be valuable to assemble
additional fire regime reconstructions across the latitudinal
and elevational ranges of northern Mexico to determine the ex-
tent and scale of climatic teleconnections with fire regimes.
Management implications
The main implications arising from this study are that fre-
quent fire played a long-term role in the ecosystem, the pat-
tern of fire occurrence has changed in recent decades, and it
will be important for managers to develop strategies for man-
aging future fires. These observations are not only relevant
for the Tutuaca reserve but are likely to be useful in related
sites in Mexico, the western United States, and Central Amer-
ica, as pine–oak forests adapted to surface fire regimes are
among the most common, and most threatened, forest eco-
systems in these regions (Biodiversity Support Program 1995).
Not enough is known about the fire ecology of Madrean
forests, as is true of Mexican forests in general (Rodríguez-
Trejo and Fulé 2003), and the sites in this study do not com-
prise a comprehensive sampling of the reserve or the region.
Nonetheless, the trends observed here are a useful starting
point. The three study sites in the Arroyo Piceas were quite
similar to each other in their pre-1955 fire regime characteris-
tics. While they may not fully represent the range of fire re-
gimes in the reserve, they provide a detailed picture of the
fire disturbance regime in the landscape surrounding the spruce
forest. It would probably be safe to consider the other pine–oak
forests in the vicinity as being similar in fire regime, at least
until additional sites can be studied.
The variability in post-1955 fire patterns indicates that
some areas of the reserve have not burned for as long as
48 years, much longer than any previous fire-free interval in
the fire-scar record. This extended fire-free interval raises
the possibility that fuels are accumulating in several ways.
At the stand level, forest floor, coarse woody debris, ladder
fuels (small trees under taller trees), and canopy fuels have
been shown to build up in Madrean forests under fire exclu-
sion, leading to severe wildfires (Fulé et al. 2000; Barton
2002). Perhaps more importantly, these types of changes in
individual stands can have a cumulative impact of increasing
the continuity of high and homogeneous fuel loads across
landscapes (e.g., White and Vankat 1993), leading to broad-
scale burning. Even assuming that stand-replacing fire oc-
curred previously to some extent in the spruce stands, the
fire-susceptible spruce trees that survived centuries of sur-
face burning all around them could succumb to a larger fire
that carries through their mesic habitat. As an isolated popu-
lation, even one fire event could permanently remove the
spruce from the reserve.
Climate change forecasts for northern Mexico, while far
from uniform in their predictions, are consistent in suggesting
that future conditions will be warmer and drier (Magaña et
al. 1997; Villers-Ruiz and Trejo-Vázquez 1998), causing veg-
etation to shift northward and upward in elevation (Villers-Ruíz
and Trejo-Vázquez 1998; Shafer et al. 2001) and increasing
the frequency and severity of extreme drought years. If the
duration and severity of fire seasons also increases (Flannigan
et al. 2000, 2001), it may be very difficult not only for
spruce but for all the temperate forests to persist in their cur-
rent elevational ranges. However, dense forests with heavy
fuel loads will be especially vulnerable to these changes,
whereas open pine–oak forests undergoing frequent burning
are likely to be more resistant.
To conserve the most options for the future, managers
should seek to reduce the probability of catastrophic loss of
the reserve’s forest. Fire should be actively suppressed in the
spruce forest and wherever intense burning threatens the large
snags and trees that are required by the thick-billed parrots.
But fire should be used wherever possible to begin to restore
a frequent surface regime to gain ecological benefits and reduce
risk of stand-replacing fire (e.g., Wagle and Eakle 1979;
Pollet and Omi 2002). The use of fire, whether ignited by
managers or through accidental or lightning ignition, should
be accomplished within the context of a fire management
plan (Rodríguez-Trejo 1996). It may be necessary to protect
valuable snags with firelines. Expertise in prescribed burning
is available nearby, through research at the Madera experimen-
tal station (Alanís-Morales et al. 2000). Conservationists and
scientists associated with the reserve may also be able to offer
assistance. Thinning of small trees, together with burning, can
help create a fire-resistant landscape as well (Agee et al. 2000).
There are caveats associated with the reintroduction of
fire. First, prescribed fires that escape because of poor plan-
ning or inexperience can have devastating ecological conse-
quences, just like a wildfire, but even more severe social
consequences, since the managers would be perceived to be
at fault. Second, historical information such as the fire re-
gime statistics presented in this study should be interpreted
in the context of modern management goals. A historical av-
erage fire-return interval every 4–5 years does not necessarily
mean that managers should emulate this pattern (Tiedemann
et al. 2000); it may be the case that desirable ecological con-
ditions could be maintained with a longer interval (e.g., Fulé
et al. 2003). Finally, Baker and Ehle (2001) called attention
to the fact that historical fires did not burn every square
metre of ground; neither should fire managers seek to create
a uniformly blackened landscape.
Protected lands around the world serve multiple objectives
and are impacted by numerous biological and social forces.
The Tutuaca site serves as one example of the interconnection
between disturbance and habitat, because recent anthropogenic
fire exclusion and future fire management decisions are im-
portant factors affecting sustainability. The importance of the
Tutuaca reserve extends beyond its boundaries and even be-
yond the rare species it conserves. The reserve represents a
new approach to conservation in Mexico that bypasses lim-
ited governmental funding to foster direct, mutually benefi-
cial interactions between conservationists and landowners. A
variety of ecological and social research initiatives should be
developed to support this important advance. Because of the
powerful role of fire, additional studies of forest structure, fu-
els, and fire patterns should complement experimental forest
restoration studies to develop the base of knowledge needed
for long-term conservation at Tutuaca and other fire-adapted
forest reserves around the world.
