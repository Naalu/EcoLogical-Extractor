restoration treatments in northern Arizona, USA

Abstract
Ecosystem restoration is emerging as a dominant ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum) forest management
objective in the semi-arid southwestern USA. Restoration consists predominantly of mechanical thinning in overly dense
stands and reintroduction of ground ﬁre, and therefore can meet a variety of community and agency objectives associated with
forest ecosystem health, wood production, ﬁre protection, recreation and scenic beauty. Ecosystem restoration and long-term
multi-aged stand management creates the growing space, microclimate and seedbed conditions necessary for natural
regeneration via density reduction and regular understory burning. Several long-term research studies have demonstrated
regeneration >100 seedlings/ha within a few years of overstory treatment when a relatively dense overstory canopy is left as a
seed source; based on the literature, the reduced density of overstory seed-producing trees following restoration treatment still
supplies sufﬁcient viable seed over time for regeneration. Our remeasurement data of treated sites showed only 18–41
seedlings/ha in the absence of ﬁre due perhaps to the reduced density of seed-producing overstory trees or lack of adequate
(ﬁre prepared) seedbed. Repeated prescribed burning of surface fuels can enhance the seedbed, but limits seedling survival
typically during the ﬁrst two decades. Survivors develop into ﬁre resistant saplings at 10 cm stump diameter and 3 m height.
Seedling density in a restoration study plots that has received two burning treatments, in 1992 and 1998, was only 12
seedlings/ha. Seedling density in the 30 growing stock level treatments at Taylor Woods averaged only 7 seedlings/ha
following one burning cycle. However, even this relatively low natural regeneration rate is sufﬁcient to supply the 3.6 trees/ha/
decade needed to sustain tree densities like those present before Euro-American settlement. # 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

1. Introduction
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum
Engelm.) ecosystems in the southwestern USA are
semi-arid forests with 50 cm of precipitation/year.
Regeneration under native, presettlement (prior to
Euro-American settlement) conditions prior to around
1876 was limited by drought, competition with grass-
land vegetation, frost heaving, and browse by rodents
and ungulates (Pearson, 1950; Schubert, 1974; White,
1985; Harrington, 1987; Covington and Moore, 1994).
Open spaces among trees were maintained by regular
surface ﬁres ignited by lightning and/or indigenous

thought to have been rare (Cooper, 1960; Covington
and Moore, 1994), and the species is therefore poorly
adapted to stand-replacing events (e.g. cones are not
serotinous). Given periodicity of seed years and
regular surface ﬁres, regeneration rates averaged only
3.6 trees/ha/decade, but presumably were sufﬁcient to
maintain the structure of these stands, with densities
estimated at <100 trees/ha (Mast et al., 1999). That
study identiﬁed four decades between 1600 and 1800
that had no representatives in the dendrochronological
record.
Beginning in 1876, large-tree logging, livestock
grazing and disruption of the natural frequent-ﬁre
regime resulted in the long-term survival of a pulse of
regeneration previously unseen in the southwest
(Covington and Moore, 1994). After only three
decades, Lang and Stewart (1910) documented 268
new trees/ha, a 337% increase in stand density. Some
areas on the Coconino Plateau now have >2000 trees/
ha (Covington and Moore, 1994). These stand
conditions present major ecosystem health and wild-
ﬁre control issues for the region, and the ﬁre seasons of
1996 and 2000 bear witness to abnormal density and
related fuel accumulations in these forests. As land
managers move to restore many of these areas to
presettlement conditions (or something that is sustain-
able and that approximates those conditions), forest
scientists need to look again at issues of pine
regeneration and growth rates. Will currently observed
regeneration rates sufﬁce for sustainability?
Tree regeneration rates are regulated by the
presence of sufﬁcient seed-producing adults, periodi-
city of their cone/seed crops, predation on cones/
seeds, seed viability rates, seedbed conditions and
germinant survival, and early seedling growth rela-
tive to microclimate, ﬁre and competitive stresses.
Periodicity of ponderosa pine cone/seed crops and
predation on cones/seeds are major limitations of
regeneration in the Southwest (Pearson, 1950; Schu-
bert, 1974; Rietveld, 1978). Mature trees produce
1 kg of seed only every 3 years on average
(Schubert, 1974); as much as 100% of the seed is
non-viable and/or preyed upon during intervening
years (Blake et al., 1985). Once on the ground, most
seed is consumed by rodents in intervening years
(Heidmann et al., 1982). In general, sufﬁcient seed
is therefore available for new regeneration only once
or perhaps twice/decade.
The periodicity of spring and summer drought
combined with vegetation competition and allelopathy
cause severe seedling mortality once seeds germinate
(Pearson, 1950). Rietveld (1975) determined that
grass communities must be disturbed through mechan-
ical means or ﬁre over at least 50% of the ground
surface to ensure adequate even-aged management
stocking—but restoration and/or low-density multi-
aged management would require much less regenera-
tion. Grass, forb and sedge production respond
strongly to levels of canopy closure (Moore and
Dieter, 1992) producing a trade-off between resources
for new germinants and competition. In addition,
Rietveld (1975)
and
Harrington
(1987)
suggest
reductions in ponderosa pine germination rates and
radicle
development
associated
with
phytotoxic
grasses and Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), respec-
tively. Cormier (1990) found that natural regeneration
of ponderosa pine on limestone soils following
shelterwood harvesting could be best predicted from
time since harvest (positive coefﬁcient, up to 16
years), residual basal area following harvest (nega-
tive), and site index (positive). These represent the
time necessary to have sufﬁcient seed production with
early germination conditions, availability of growing
space following disturbance and inherent site quality,
respectively.
The role of ﬁre in long-term pine regeneration rates
is also important. In low-intensity prescribed ﬁre
treatments in northern Arizona, Harrington and
Sackett (1990) found partial to full consumption of
litter over 75% of the ground surface; mortality of
seedlings <0.3 m in height was high in these areas.
Gaines et al. (1958) recorded 98% mortality in
ponderosa pine seedlings (<0.3 m height) and 70%
mortality in saplings (>0.3 m in height to <2.5 cm
dbh) following prescribed ﬁre treatment. Surviving
seedlings and saplings came predominantly from the
25% unburned ground surface, and from saplings
>1.2 m in height, which have survival rates >50%
(Gaines et al., 1958).
Given requirements for ponderosa pine germination
and regeneration growing space (Schubert, 1974) and
current forest conditions in much of northern Arizona,
decades could pass (and have passed) without
vigorous regeneration. For a silviculturist, the short-
age of young vigorous trees in these forests is as
troublesome as the lack of large presettlement trees.

The objective of this paper is to review this conceptual
framework for ponderosa pine regeneration and to
evaluate whether pine regeneration following ecolo-
gical restoration treatments in southwestern ponderosa
pine forests will be sufﬁcient to sustain the ecosystem.
We examine data from local long-term research
installations together with recent remeasurements,
both with and without prescribed surface ﬁre treat-
ments, and compare them with the known age
structure of presettlement forests.
2. Methods
Seedling data were collected from two neighboring
long-term research installations in northern Arizona:
the Taylor Woods level of growing stock (LOGS) and
Gus Pearson natural area (GPNA) ecological restora-
tion study sites. Both sites are located 15 km north-
west of Flagstaff, AZ (at 3581601100N, 11184403000W)
on the Coconino National Forest, and are pure
ponderosa pine overstories. Soils are basalt- and
volcanic cinder-based forming a ﬁne montmorillonitic
complex of frigid Typic Argiborolls and Argiboralfs
with an average site index of 25 m in 100 years
(Minor, 1964). Slopes are gentle (<5%) with southern
and western aspects. This speciﬁc area receives an
average of 57 cm of precipitation annually, with about
half in the form of winter/spring snowfall and half in
late summer rains following an extensive dry period
from May to July. Elevation is 2240 m with 94 frost-
free growing days. The understory is dominated by
native grasses
(mostly
Arizona
fescue,
Festuca
arizonica and mountain muhly, Muhlenbergia mon-
tana) and a variety of herbaceous species; Ceanothus
fendleri is the only common shrub.
Taylor Woods LOGS study site was established in
1962 and, for every 10 years since, replicate 0.5 ha
plots within the study area have been maintained at a
range of growing stock levels (GSLs) within an even-
aged management strategy (Ronco et al., 1985). We
examined the plots that have 30 and 60 GSL
treatments, which are characterized as heavy regular
thinnings corresponding to 6.9 and 13.8 m2/ha of
basal area at 25 cm quadratic mean diameter. Both
thinnings produced modest pine regeneration and
grass responses beginning with the ﬁrst harvesting
activity in 1962. Overstory tree information has been
measured periodically using standard mensurational
techniques (Ronco et al., 1985). We visually estimated
percent cover of grass and herbaceous plants in
September 1997 and again in 1998 with eight
randomly located subplots per treatment area using
1 m2 sampling frames. A prescribed ﬁre treatment was
introduced into this study area in October 1998 when
half of each replicate plot was burned with a light
surface ﬁre (maximum ﬂame length <1 m).
The GPNA is a 3 ha research site established in
1992 to test a range of ecosystem responses to two
ecological restoration treatments in a ponderosa pine
ecosystem (Covington et al., 1997). ‘Partial restora-
tion’ was a mechanical thinning of the overabundance
of smaller diameter trees (<50 cm dbh) that developed
from a 1919 regeneration event. ‘Full restoration’ was
an identical thinning that included mechanical repla-
cement of pine surface fuels with grass and herbac-
eous fuels followed by a light prescribed surface burn.
The complete restoration treatment area was burned a
second time in the fall of 1998; both burns had
maximum ﬂame length <1 m. Fig. 1 presents the stand
diameter distribution following mechanical overstory
thinning in the GPNA, combining the partial and full
restoration areas. The restoration left 12.6 m2/ha of
basal area, 25% of which is in the 75–105 cm diameter
classes. This presettlement restoration prescription
serves as one model for ponderosa pine restoration in
the southwest and is a likely target for treating much of
the forested area in the Flagstaff wildland-urban
interface. Over- and understory measurements have
been taken periodically since the original treatment in
1992.
Current overstory densities at the GPNA restoration
site are similar to (and bracketed by) those at the
Taylor Woods study site (Table 1). These overstory
densities yield similar understory grass and herbac-
eous plant responses despite the differences between
the objectives of the management: restoration of
multi-aged stand structure versus maintenance of
even-aged structure. Such understory plant responses
to overstory density and thinning have been previously
demonstrated in the Southwest (e.g. Moore and Dieter,
1992).
We conducted a 100% survey of the area for
ponderosa pine seedlings at least 20 cm in height in
both study areas in 1999, both in the burned and
unburned subplots at Taylor Woods and in the partial

273

and full restoration treatments at the GPNA. Pine
seedlings were tallied by species, 15 cm height class,
and one of three condition codes based primarily on
damage severity from ﬁre (in burned subplots): living,
declining—partial scorch, and recent death—full
scorch. Diameters were also recorded for tallied
seedlings at Taylor Woods. Charred and scorched
remnants
of
seedlings,
most
with
needles
still
attached, served as evidence of pre-burning seedlings.
Overall density and damage rates were summarized
for each area and expanded to a per area basis.
Other data presented in this paper are manipulations
of others’ published data. We summarized data
presented in much greater detail in Sackett (1984).
Also, presettlement tree density and diameter dis-
tribution from Covington et al. (1997) and Mast et al.
(1999) were ﬁt into an uneven-aged (multi-aged)
silvicultural framework based on BDq: basal area,
maximum diameter, and q-ratio (Smith et al., 1997).
Speciﬁcation of BDq for a stand is an attempt to
balance standing tree density with expectations for
growth and mortality up to some maximum diameter.
Such an uneven-aged silvicultural approach is a
logical ﬁt given the conceptual intent of ecological
restoration (e.g. sustainable forest cover) and resulting
overstory diameter distribution.
Finally, for purposes of evaluating regeneration
requirements, we assumed minimum estimates of
Fig. 1. Ponderosa pine diameter class distribution (bars) following presettlement restoration treatment at the GPNA in northern Arizona, with
an overlaid line showing a proposed multi-aged BDq distribution (12.4–105–1.24) to approximate presettlement basal area, density and
maximum diameter.

positive factors affecting regeneration rates (e.g. seed
production) and maximum estimates of negative
factors (e.g. ﬁre mortality). Thus, conservative but
realistic assessments of potential regeneration issues
are identiﬁed, which can be addressed with future
research as necessary.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Regeneration requirements
A
BDq
of
12.4–105–1.24
(55–42–1.24)
was
assigned as the best approximation to presettlement
conditions and stand diameter distribution following
ecological restoration treatments (Fig. 1). Many areas
in northern Arizona have an even lower density of
trees in the 45–65 cm diameter classes given past
harvesting practices. Such stands ﬁt this BDq more
closely up to 65 cm, but lack even more trees >70 cm.
Given spatial variability in density of the largest
ponderosa pine trees within the landscape, this BDq
can alternatively be viewed as 9.5–75–1.24 with up to
25% of stand basal area carried above the 70 cm
diameter limit without any restraint on actual diameter
class distribution or maximum tree size. At the lower
end of the distribution (Fig. 1), multiple regeneration
events over several decades are necessary to supply
<25 cm diameter trees required by this BDq; however,
that regeneration is more likely now than prior to
restoration given the availability of new growing space
on the site.
The restoration distribution and BDq (q ¼ 1:24)
shown in Fig. 1 is consistent with observed mortality
rates of ponderosa pine >30 cm dbh (Pearson, 1950;
Mast et al., 1999), and this diameter is the ﬁrst
requirement for assessing regeneration requirements.
Given 8.8 trees/ha 35 cm in diameter and a radial
growth rate of 1.6 cm/decade (US Department of
Agriculture Forest Service, unpublished data from the
Taylor Woods site), these trees require about 30 years
to grow into the 45 cm diameter class. Pearson (1950)
observed a mortality rate of 10% for these diameter
classes well below the 20% mortality implied by a q-
ratio of 1.24. Observed mortality rates increased for
larger trees (Pearson, 1950). Radial growth rates
slowed with increasing diameter such that the 55 and
65 cm diameter classes match exactly. A q-ratio of
1.24 underestimates mortality for diameter classes
>65 cm.
3.2. Regeneration densities
Observed regeneration densities in these two long-
term study sites (Table 1) conﬁrmed the importance of
both reduced overstory density at Taylor Woods (due
to shading and resource competition) and presence of
ﬁre (for seedbed preparation). The 30 GSL treatment
at 65 trees/ha contained twice the number of seedlings
as the higher density 60 GSL treatment (188 trees/ha).
The low-density partial restoration treatment (79 trees/
ha) had a comparable regeneration density to the 30
GSL treatment. These regeneration densities were low
by many standards, particularly in other parts of the
world with other management objectives; however,
they are more than sufﬁcient to supply either the BDq/
restoration diameter distribution (Fig. 1) or the
minimum requisite 3.6 trees/ha/decade determined
by Mast et al. (1999).
Regeneration appeared successful despite a reduc-
tion in the number of seed producing trees following
thinning, and their ability to produce and distribute
viable seed. Heidmann et al. (1982) established a
requirement for 12 seed-producing trees/ha >65 cm
dbh to achieve full stocking—an even-aged manage-
ment objective of 1000 seedlings/ha over 70% of a
treatment area. Target regeneration for restoration or
multi-aged management objectives is less than one-
tenth
of
this
even-aged
management
objective,
suggesting a requirement of only one or two large
seed-producing tree/ha which is provided by ecolo-
gical restoration treatments. The location of these
trees and ability to disperse seed obviously affects
regeneration location, but not its frequency at a
landscape scale.
3.3. Role of ﬁre
Pre-burn seedling density in 1998 in the full
restoration treatment was 96 seedlings/ha, twice that
of the partial restoration. Sackett (1984) found a
greater than three-fold increase in seedling density in
burned areas relative to control areas, 6420 versus
2057 seedlings/ha, respectively, which he measured 1
year following burning in 1976. That year happened to
be a good seed year within that decade. Eighty-three
J.D. Bailey, W.W. Covington / Forest Ecology and Management 155 (2002) 271–278
275

percent of the seedlings in the burned plots had
germinated on mineral soil (Sackett, 1984). Two years
later, densities had fallen to 1235 and 0 seedlings/ha,
respectively, in burned and control areas. Table 2
summarizes
regeneration
data
following
another
excellent seed year in 1983 (adapted from Sackett,
1984). Burning has been recognized as important for
ponderosa pine regeneration as early as Pearson
(1923).
Though burning enhances the seedbed for ponder-
osa pine, it also limits short-term survival of seedlings
given crown scorch and cambium injury. Survival
rates measured at Taylor Woods (Table 3), with a large
range of seedling/sapling size, were similar to those
published by Sackett (1984). All saplings >5 cm
diameter at stump height and >2 m in total height were
still alive following surface ﬁre despite evidence of
scorch at their bases. Harrington and Sackett (1990)
and Gaines et al. (1958) similarly recorded little to no
mortality of larger saplings (>10 cm dbh). Fire
mortality was slightly higher (76%) at the GPNA
complete restoration treatment where most (78%) of
the seedlings were <60 cm in height, having germi-
nated since 1992 (Table 3). The GPNA treatment area
was extremely dense (3095 trees/ha) prior to treatment
and had little advance reproduction from prior to 1992
to carry over into the restoration (Covington et al.,
1997). Fire mortality was lower (only 5 of 14, 36%) in
these seedlings >60 cm in height. There were no
seedlings/saplings greater than 1 m in height to
compare to saplings at Taylor Woods. The survival
rates shown in Table 2, adapted from Sackett (1984),
are based on seedlings/saplings of unknown size.
4. Conclusions and management implications
Ecological restoration and multi-aged management
of southwestern ponderosa pine forests will not suffer
from a shortage of pine regeneration. Our data, along

with that in the literature, establishes that adequate
regeneration will be available most decades for most
areas following ecological restoration and/or multi-
aged management treatments that include regular
prescribed ﬁre. Most decades (including the 1990s for
our data) have provided one or two good seed years for
a sufﬁcient number of residual overstory trees, and
there is no reason to expect this to change in the near
future. These good seed years have compensated for
and will continue to overwhelm natural levels of seed
loss and predation. Mechanical thinning of the
overstory and prescribed surface ﬁre provide the
necessary growing space for germination and early
seedling growth in the order of thousands of seedlings/
ha, given ﬁre to assist with seedbed preparation and
temporary disturbance of understory communities.
The
heavy
thinning
associated
with
ecological
restoration and/or low-density multi-aged manage-
ment provides a near-maximum amount of growing
space for an extended time period. Low but still
adequate densities of seedlings regenerate even with-
out ﬁre given sufﬁcient overstory thinning.
A hypothetical scenario and some simple mathe-
matics demonstrate that regeneration densities would
not fall below that required for ecological restoration
and/or low-density multi-aged management. Assume
that a restoration treatment leaves 5 stems/ha of
advanced regeneration and is followed by two good
seed years/decade producing 1000 seedlings/ha and
good growth rates for 40% of those seedlings (0.5 cm
radial growth/year). Assume 90% survival of larger
(>5 cm) seedlings and 25% survival of smaller
seedlings through two prescribed surface ﬁres/decade.
With these assumptions, regeneration density stabi-
lizes
over
the
long
term
at
400
seedlings/ha,
approximately 100 of which are 5–10 cm in diameter
and well stationed to move into the overstory diameter
distribution. These seedlings/saplings are more than
sufﬁcient to provide the 3.6 or 17 seedlings/ha
required for presettlement restoration or multi-aged
management, respectively. Seeding, germination and
growth rates would have to be reduced substantially
below those in the literature to approach even 17
seedlings/ha.
Periodic regeneration failures are likely, however,
on some hectares during some decades. Mast et al.
(1999) report four decades from 1600 to 1800 A.D.
without representation in the dendrochronological
record for this area. However, both ecological
restoration and low-density multi-aged management
systems can accommodate periodic failures during
natural biotic and climatic cycles, even with modest
anthropogenic change (e.g. global change and inva-
sion by exotic plants). Only sustained conditions
that are well outside the known historical range of
natural variability for southwestern ponderosa pine
ecosystems threaten the sustainability of natural
regeneration. Indeed, the current overabundance of
smaller diameter pine trees and related biomass/fuel
accumulations are such a deviation from the range
of natural variability in many of our southwestern
forests. This condition is a far greater threat to sus-
tainable ponderosa pine regeneration and forms the
impetus for ecological restoration and multi-aged
management.
