Executive Summary 
 
In 2014, the Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI) at Northern Arizona University was 
contracted by the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest and the White Mountain Stewardship 
Project (WMSP) Monitoring Board to address four of the prioritized ecological monitoring 
questions developed for the WMSP (Sitko and Hurteau 2010). The questions were:  
 
1. Is there a difference between pre-treatment crown fire potential and post-treatment 
desired fire behavior across selected analysis areas?  
2. What proportion of treated acres exhibited a change in Fire Regime Condition Class 
(FRCC)?  
3. Are patch sizes of denser (i.e., untreated or lightly treated) areas connected? What is the 
range of areas and sizes of these patches?  
4. Are exotics/invasive species present at landings and burn piles?  
 
The ERI worked closely with Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest staff to identify projects 
and obtain available maps, data, and other information to addresses these questions for WMSP 
treatments across six task orders (“projects”) completed in 2013 and 2014. Treatment effects 
were based on estimates of pre-treatment conditions (Question 1) and analysis of field data 
(Questions 1 and 4) as well as remotely sensed data derived from post-treatment imagery 
(Questions 2 and 3). This report summarizes findings related to the four monitoring questions. 
We also provide electronic files of project area maps, plot locations, plot photos, and raw field 
data archived on a separate compact disc. 
 
 
Analyses of field and remotely sensed data indicated the following:  
 
1. In general, WMSP treatments resulted in reduced canopy fuel loading and potential fire 
behavior across the project areas. Although potential fire behavior was generally reduced 
by treatments, resulting stand structure was further interpreted in light of forest 
restoration goals. WMSP treatments effectively reduced potential fire behavior and 
appeared to restore more natural structural characteristics. Future treatments could more 
explicitly utilize NRV concepts such as tree spatial distribution, age structure, and species 
composition—obtained from site-specific pre-settlement evidence.  
2. WMSP treatments implemented in 2013 and 2014 moved the landscape along a trajectory 
toward stands that are more similar to historic conditions. The changes are very small, 
which is expected at the rate treatments are being conducted. Most of the WMSP 
treatments occurred in the ponderosa pine forest type, which evolved with frequent fire 
and is currently in much denser conditions across the intermountain West today than 
historically. Treatments in these forests can have multiple benefits: fire risk reduction is a 
primary objective of WMSP, but restoration objectives can also be met with tree density 
reduction and the creation of openings for a more diverse and resilient understory plant 
community. 
3. WMSP treatments retained untreated and lightly treated, higher canopy cover patches but 
these patches showed low connectivity across project areas. Although little information is 
available to guide restoration prescriptions at emulating natural landscape patterns, high 
cover patches may provide habitat for canopy dependent species such as tassel-eared 

2 
 
squirrels, but retaining these patches may also compromise other restoration goals related 
to decreasing crown fire hazard, improving understory production, and enhancing soil 
function.  
4. In answering the question of whether invasive plant species are found on landings and 
slash piles, we did find a very small number of plants/populations on these microsites, but 
we did not find evidence to indicate that these sites had conditions that were more 
favorable to establishment than any other type of microsite. Difficulty in retrospectively 
identifying slash piles and landings led us to develop a methodology wherein microsites 
were categorized where invasive plants were found. Microsite conditions included type of 
ground cover and amount of sunlight in the vicinity of non-native occurrences. Nearly all 
recorded occurrences of invasive plants were either in full sun or partial sun and on 
recently burned areas. No invasive plants were found in heavily shaded microsites. 
Fourteen percent of recorded occurrences of invasives were on roads or skid trails. Bull 
thistle (Cirsium vulgare) was the most widespread species. Our monitoring data indicate 
that most invasive plants in the WMSP are found in a gradient ranging from bare mineral 
soil to litter and in partial to full sun.

White Mountain Stewardship Project Treatment Areas 
A total of six White Mountain Stewardship (WMS) Task Orders (hereafter “projects”) were 
treated in 2013 and 2014 and identified for monitoring in 2014 (Table 1.1). Four projects were 
located on the Alpine Ranger District and two were located on the Springerville Ranger District. 
Project maps provided by U.S. Forest Service staff showed treatment unit boundaries and project 
locations. Project areas ranged from 595 to 4,452 acres in size. One to six cutting units were 
selected for sampling in each project for a total of 19 cutting units. Most cutting units within 
project areas (80%) were between 40 and 225 acres in size. No pretreatment monitoring data 
were identified for any of the 2013 or 2014 projects. Stand structure sampling methods followed 
protocols described in Sitko and Hurteau (2010).  
 
 
As per WMSP pre-treatment sampling protocol, one to six cutting units (hereafter “unit”) 
within each project were randomly selected for monitoring. The number of cutting units that 
were selected for sampling was based on the size of the cutting unit. For projects that were 300 
acres or less in size, one cutting unit was selected. For projects that were 300 to 1000 acres in 
size, three cutting units were selected. For projects greater than 1,000 acres, there was one 
additional cutting unit selected for each 500 acres. Selected cutting unit boundaries were 
digitized from hardcopy maps using a geographic information system (GIS; ArcGIS 9.3). 
Acreage of units was determined, and based on unit size three to six plots were allocated. 
Sampling intensity was one plot per 20 acres with a minimum of three plots and a maximum of 
six plots per unit (Table 1.1) (Sitko and Hurteau 2010). Sample plot locations were randomly 
selected using the Hawth’s Tools extension for ArcGIS. Sample plot locations are provided in 
electronic data files accompanying this report.  
 
Field Sampling Protocols 
Maps and global positioning systems (GPS) were used in the field to navigate to sample plot 
locations. At each location, a 0.10-acre circular sample plot was established. Plot centers were 
demarcated for long-term remeasurement using an 8-inch piece of steel rebar driven into the soil. 
Aluminum tags indicating unit and plot number were attached to rebar. In addition, a reference 
tag indicating direction and distance to plot center was attached to the base of a large, live tree in 
each plot. 
 
Variable radius sampling (10 basal-area factor) was used at each plot center to estimate 
stand basal area (BA; ft2 ac-1) of live and standing dead trees (Avery and Burkhart 2002). Tree 
species was recorded as well as diameter for all “in” (tallied) trees. For all live tallied trees, total 
height and height to base of live crown was recorded. In addition, linear distance to each cut 
stump was measured and a plot radius factor was used in combination with stump diameter to 
determine a limiting distance for stump tallies. Cut stumps were categorized as “thinned” if they 
appeared to have been cut as part of WMSP treatments. Tallies and diameters of thinned stumps 
were used to estimate pre-treatment stand conditions. One transect (50 ft) was installed at each 

5 
 
plot to sample woody surface fuels. Each transect was oriented on a due east azimuth (90ᵒ) from 
plot center. Surface fuels were tallied by moisture-lag classes (1, 10, 100, and 1,000-hrs) 
following methods given in Brown (1974). The largest class (i.e., 1,000-hr fuels) was further 
separated into sound and rotten categories.

Tree regeneration (i.e., seedlings < 4.5 ft in height) was tallied by species within a 0.025-acre 
plot centered on the sample location point. Lastly, canopy cover (%) was estimated at each plot 
using a densitometer. One categorical canopy cover reading was taken every 6.5 feet along a 
65.6-ft transect oriented on a south (180ᵒ) azimuth for 10 total measurements at each plot. 
Number of under canopy “hits” was multiplied by 10 to estimate canopy cover for each plot. 
 
Analysis 
To analyze changes in potential fire behavior within WMS cutting units, we used NEXUS 2.0 
crown fire analysis software (www.fire.org). We ran the NEXUS model using inputs from post-
treatment plot measurements and compared outputs to those of modeling runs using estimated 
pre-treatment conditions. In addition, we generated basic stand structure and fuels summaries for 
pretreatment and post-treatment periods. Variables summarized were species importance, trees 

6 
 
per acre (TPA), BA, mean diameter (QMD), crown base height (CBH), crown fuel load (CFL), 
canopy cover, and canopy bulk density (CBD). Pre-treatment estimates of forest structure (TPA, 
BA, CFL, and CBD) were made by reconstructing tree sizes from cut stumps observed on field 
sample plots. Crown base heights for cut stumps were estimated by using regression equations 
developed from diameter at stump height and crown base height relationships for sampled live 
trees. 
 
Canopy bulk density (and CFL) was estimated using equations found in Cruz et al. 
(2003). We also used the lowest quintile live crown base height from post-treatment plot 
measurements and pre-treatment estimates. Pretreatment and post-treatment fire weather 
extremes (98th–100th percentile conditions) using the dates of June 6–12, 2011 were obtained 
from the Remote Automatic Weather Station (RAWS) in Greer, Arizona (020404). We selected 
these conditions to represent an extreme fire behavior period as these were the observations 
recorded during the Wallow Fire on these dates. Fuel moistures for these conditions were 
generated by FireFamilyPlus (www.firemodels.org). We also used 33 miles per hour as the wind 
speed at 20 feet to parameterize NEXUS model runs. This wind speed was the average daily 
speed at 20 feet recorded June 6–12, 2011 at the Greer RAWS. We used Fuel Model 10 for 
pretreatment and Fuel Model 2 for post-treatment NEXUS simulations (Scott and Burgan 2005).  
 
Results 
 
Four of the six (67%) of WMSP projects in 2013 and 2014 were implemented in ponderosa pine 
(Pinus ponderosa) or ponderosa pine–Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) forest ecosystems. 
Cutting units in two of the six projects contained one or more species other than ponderosa pine. 
The Nobel and Burro projects contained white-fir (Abies concolor), aspen (Populus tremuloides), 
Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and southwestern white pine (Pinus strobiformis). Ranges 
for mean project area stand density, BA, and tree diameter before treatment were 209–349 TPA, 
133–205 ft2 ac-1, and 13–18 in., respectively. Table 1.2 shows cutting unit-level, pretreatment 
summaries.  
Thinning reduced stand density and basal area on all projects, and increased mean 
diameter on four of six projects. Ranges for post-treatment stand density, BA, and mean diameter 
for all projects were 0–105 TPA, 0–57 ft2 ac-1, and 0–16 in., respectively. Thinning reduced 
stand density and basal area on all sampled cutting units, and increased mean diameter on 16 of 
19 cutting units (84%). Ranges for post-treatment stand density, BA, and mean diameter were 0–
173 TPA, 0–93 ft2 ac-1, and 0–21 in., respectively. Table 1.2 shows cutting unit-level, post-
treatment summaries. 
Effects of thinning on stand structure generally translated to reductions in canopy fuels 
(Table 1.2). Thinning reduced crown fuel loading and canopy bulk density on all projects. Crown 
base height was increased on four of the six (67%) projects. Reduced canopy fuel loading 
resulted in reductions in predicted fire behavior. Table 1.3 shows cutting unit level fire behavior 
model outputs. All of the projects showed a change from active pretreatment crown fire potential 
to passive post-treatment crown fire potential. Treatments reduced rate of spread on all projects 
(100%). Both fireline intensity and flame length were reduced and crowning index was increased 
by treatments in all projects (Table 1.3). The greatest reductions in predicted fire behavior were 
found on units where tree density and basal area were lowest post-treatment.

Discussion 
 
In general, treatments resulted in reduced canopy fuel loading and potential fire behavior across 
the project areas. Although potential fire behavior was generally reduced by treatments, resulting 
stand structure can be further evaluated in light of forest restoration goals. 
 
Two central goals of the White Mountain Stewardship Project are to restore forest health 
and reduce the threat of uncharacteristic wildfire (Sitko and Hurteau 2010). Prior to Euro-
American settlement and the intensive land uses that commenced in the late 19th century, 
ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer forests of the Southwest were generally less dense and 
more open in structure than forests of today (Covington and Moore 1994). These open forest 
conditions both supported and were a product of frequent surface fires burning through fine 
understory fuels (Covington 2003). With settlement and intensive land use, historical fire 
regimes were disrupted and forest structure eventually became drastically altered (Moore et al. 
1999). Restoration of forest health in its most basic form calls for treatments that result in stand 
structures that fall within natural ranges of variability (NRV). NRV characterizes ecosystem 
function prior to degradation (i.e., fire regime disruption in southwestern frequent-fire forests). 
For example, forest reconstruction analysis and historical surveys have indicated that density and 
basal area of stands ranged about 11–137 TPA, and 16–124 ft2 ac-1, respectively, before 
settlement (Stoddard 2011). It should be noted that 75% of the reconstructed values fall between 
about 22 and 74 TPA, and between 38 and 81 ft2 ac-1 BA (Stoddard 2011). These central areas of 
the probability distributions would be suitable guides for developing basic restoration 
prescriptions where site-specific reference information is lacking. In addition, Reynolds et al. 
(2013) provide an appropriate set of NRV-based objectives for restoring resilience to 
southwestern ponderosa pine and warm/dry mixed conifer ecosystems. 
Based on field data from sample plots, 100% of the cutting units and projects were 
outside NRV for TPA prior to treatment (Table 1.2). After treatment, none of the projects 
exhibited TPA higher than NRV, and one cutting unit in the Burro project and two cutting units 
in the Nobel project fell below the NRV. This was due to the Wallow Fire that caused 100% 
mortality prior to treatment in these cutting units. Due to high mortality, these cutting units were 
salvage logged; thus, they do not provide information relevant to the monitoring questions for 
the WMSP.  Mean TPA in 83% of the projects were within the central area of the NRV 
probability distribution. Before treatment, 100% of the projects showed BA outside NRV (Table 
1.2). Treatments reduced BA in 100% of the projects to within NRV; with the exception of the 
cutting units that were burned in the Wallow Fire (Table 1.2). Of the six projects, five showed 
BA to be within the central area of the NRV probability distribution.  
Treatments increased mean diameter on the majority of the projects (Table 1.2). This 
indicated that smaller trees that comprise ladder fuels were removed in thinning prescriptions, 
and diameter distributions were shifted toward larger classes on most projects. Several studies 
have indicated that stand structures prior to fire regime disruption were typically comprised of all 
sizes and ages of trees and not dominated by smaller, younger trees as shown in most 
contemporary forests (Fulé et al. 1997, Mast et al. 1999, Roccaforte et al. 2010).  
In summary, WMSP treatments effectively reduced potential fire behavior and appeared 
to restore more natural structural characteristics. Future treatments could more explicitly utilize 
NRV concepts and site-specific pre-settlement evidence. Some additional focus on NRV 
concepts such as tree spatial distribution, size/age structure, percent canopy cover and species 
composition would complement restoration efforts. Descriptions provided by Reynolds et al. 
(2013) provide a good framework for incorporating NRV.

Analysis Extent 
The area used in this analysis was the administrative boundary of each of the Ranger Districts 
that wasn’t significantly burned by the 2011 Wallow Fire within the Apache-Sitgreaves National 
Forest. Both the Springerville and Alpine RD saw significant acreages of high to moderate 
severity fire. While the return of fire can improve ecological departure of systems, the high 
severity fire in ponderosa pine and dry mixed conifer are out of the natural range of variability 
for these systems. The impact of these fires is further discussed below in the Fire Regime 
Condition Class section. Most importantly, assessing the impact of the Wallow Fire was 
outside the scope of this original project. We targeted the Lakeside and parts of the Black 
Mesa Districts where White Mountain Stewardship Projects were implemented in 2013; 
unfortunately, no WMS treatments were implemented in the Black Mesa District in 2013.  
 
Over 40 forest, woodland, and grass/shrub types (plant association groups, modified to 
Biophysical Setting (BpS)) were found across the Lakeside RD. However, White Mountain 
Stewardship treatments were consistently implemented in no more than four BpS’s with majority 
of treatments implement in the Southern Rocky Mountain Ponderosa Pine Woodland BpS (Table 
2.1).

Fire Regime Condition Class  
The Fire Regime Condition Class (FRCC) concept was developed to help land managers assess 
ecological conditions. FRCC is a landscape metric that incorporates a simple designation of the 
degree of departure of current vegetation composition and fire regimes from historical vegetation 
composition and fire regimes. FRCC can only be assessed at landscapes large enough to 
incorporate a “natural disturbance event.” Therefore, changes within smaller projects need to be 
cumulatively addressed in the larger landscape. A 100-acre treatment does not change FRCC.  
 
The FRCC Departure index is developed using reference conditions from the historical 
range of variability (HRV), within which dynamic ecosystems generally remain over time 
(Morgan et al. 1994). Reference conditions in the Southwest were created by local experts and 
available literature for many ecosystems with Vegetation Dynamic Development Tool (VDDT) 

12 
 
(LANDFIRE mapping process). Although FRCC encompasses both departure in system 
structural conditions and departure in fire regime, the standardized index used across the U.S. 
incorporates only structural condition departure. This is done by assessing the current 
distribution of a coarse delineation of successional (or seral) stages for each vegetation type and 
comparing with the expected distribution from reference conditions (Schmidt et al. 2002). 
 
We used the FRCC Ecological Departure standardized index to develop the departure of 
current forest structure stage distributions from historic successional stage distributions. Across 
much of our federal lands, late successional stages are much rarer on the landscape than 
historically as a result of past harvest management. Much of our forested federal lands are 
composed of trees classified as “mid-successional,” but represent a range of densities.  
 
Condition Class simply categorizes the ecological departure index into three categories 
(Table 2.2, conditional class 1 = 1–33% departure; condition class 2 > 33% departure and < 66% 
departure; and condition class 3 > 66% departure; Rice et al. 2007). The higher the condition 
class, the more altered the system is, implying significant alteration of stand and landscape 
function.  
 
Table 2.2. Condition Class index (Hann et al., 2003). 
 
Condition Class 
Description of Potential Risks 
Condition Class 1  
Within the natural (historical) 
range of variability of vegetation 
characteristics; fuel composition; 
fire frequency, severity and 
pattern; and other associated 
disturbances. 
Fire behavior, effects, and other associated 
disturbances are similar to those that occurred 
prior to fire exclusion (suppression) and other 
types of management that do not mimic the 
natural fire regime and associated vegetation 
and fuel characteristics. Composition and 
structure of vegetation and fuels are similar to 
the natural (historical) regime. Risk of loss of 
key ecosystem components (e.g. native species, 
large trees, and soil) are low. 
Condition Class 2  
Moderate departure from the 
natural (historical) regime of 
vegetation characteristics; fuel 
composition; fire frequency, 
severity and pattern; and other 
associated disturbances. 
Fire behavior, effects, and other associated 
disturbances are moderately departed (more or 
less severe). Composition and structure of 
vegetation and fuel are moderately altered. 
Uncharacteristic conditions range from low to 
moderate; Risk of loss of key ecosystem 
components are moderate. 
Condition Class 3  
High departure from the natural 
(historical) regime of vegetation 
characteristics; fuel composition; 
fire frequency, severity and 
pattern; and other associated 
disturbances. 
Fire behavior, effects, and other associated 
disturbances are highly departed (more or less 
severe). Composition and structure of 
vegetation and fuel are highly altered. 
Uncharacteristic conditions range from 
moderate to high. Risk of loss of key ecosystem 
components are high. 
 
Mapping and Assessment Tools 
The technical team used the LANDFIRE data layers to assess pre-treatment conditions on the 
Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest and to capture the reference conditions. We used the 
administrative boundaries of the Ranger Districts for the analysis area. The data layers used 
included:

b. lists appropriate landscape level for each BpS 
 
Assumptions and Known Issues 
1. Biophysical Setting (BpS): The BpS includes the area’s native species — determined 
according to our best understanding of the historical or natural range of variation, 
including disturbances. Each BpS can be associated with a Fire Regime (see Table 1), 
describing the characteristic fire frequency and severity for that BpS. Known issues in 
Region 3 for LANDFIRE mapping include BpS designation and scaling errors. Where 
there was a lack of ground data to inform the national mapping effort, LANDSAT 
imagery was difficult to interpret and assign appropriately. As a result, BpS maps are best 
used at district-level to regional scales, and not for project-level planning. Local data sets 
are best for project planning. LANDFIRE BpS’s were used for this analysis because 
successional stage data, needed for FRCC Ecological Departure mapping, were not 
available from local data sets. The Condition Class (CC) analysis was done for each BpS 
(e.g., ponderosa pine) where White Mountain Stewardship projects were implemented in 
2011, within each Ranger District.  
2. Current Succession Classes: To efficiently use the mapping tool, each vegetation type 
was broken down into different successional classes. For example, ponderosa pine was 
broken into five successional classes (Table 2.3): 
 
Table 2.3. Successional classes for ponderosa pine.

B 
MSC 
Mid-successional closed = “middle aged” stands characterized in ponderosa 
pine by pole-sized trees. Closed refers to canopy cover — in this case, 
closed canopies are characterized by canopies with greater than 40% closure 
(many of these stands have interlocking crowns). 
C 
MSO 
Mid-successional open = “middle aged” stands characterized in ponderosa 
pine by pole-sized trees. Open refers to canopy cover – in this case, open 
canopies are characterized by canopies with less than 40% closure. 
D 
LSO 
Late-successional open = old-growth stands characterized in ponderosa pine 
by the large diameter, orange-bark trees. Open canopy as above. 
E 
LSC 
Late-successional closed = old-growth stands characterized in ponderosa 
pine by the large diameter, orange-bark trees. Closed canopy as above. 
 

14 
 
The distribution of these successional stages across the landscape was calculated for 
current forests for each vegetation type, and then compared with historic successional 
stage distributions for each vegetation type. The historic successional stage distributions 
are not spatially explicit, but in tabular form. A departure index was calculated for each 
vegetation type based on the similarity of these distributions (see results Tables 5–6. See 
www.frcc.gov for more information on the departure index calculations).  
3. Known Issues of LANDFIRE Region 3 successional class include mis-classifications into 
the late-successional, closed-canopy successional stage (Code E). The height cut-offs of 
late successional in this region were 10 m (~33ft). Therefore, any stand with tree heights 
over 33 feet were classified as late-successional. Ground data confirm that multiple “mid-
successional” stages were mis-classified as “late-successional” because of this height cut-
off. 
4. Landscape Analyses Units: Ranger District classification, no known issues. 
5. Historic successional stage distribution can be estimated from a variety of data; the best 
data are found in stands still existing with their natural fire regime intact. If no intact 
stands are available, historic stand structure is calculated from dendrochronology studies 
(tree ring counts), fire history studies, and/or ecological modeling. We used the 
LANDFIRE regional modeling results (2009) to determine historic successional stage 
distributions. Known issues include small data availability for non-ponderosa pine forest 
types with greater utilization of local expert knowledge. 
 
Results 
 
The results from the Condition Class mapping tool were summarized to assess departure across 
all treated vegetation types (BpS’s) for each Ranger District on the Apache-Sitgreaves NF.  
 
Treatment Effects on Ecological Departure 
White Mountain Stewardship treatments were developed from Apache-Sitgreaves NF; spatial 
data were either acquired from the forest, or digitized from paper maps received from forest 
staff. 
 
Because FRCC is a landscape metric, large areas of the landscape would need to see 
changes to show significant differences in pre-treatment and post-treatment ecological departure. 
What can be expected from smaller treatment areas are small shifts that can suggest trends along 
the ecological departure scale. 
 
The Wallow Fire impacted the ecological departure scale dramatically. Assessing 
this change was out of the scope of this analysis. However, high severity fire moves 
successional classes to Early Successional (ES). Historic distributions suggest an overage of 
10% of ponderosa pine and mixed conifer systems were in ES stages at any one time. 
Increases well above this would increase the ecological departure. 
 
In the Lakeside RD, assumptions were made to determine treatment impacts on 
successional stage distributions. Because White Mountain Stewardship treatments focus on 
smaller diameter tree removal and reductions in canopy cover and ladder fuels, we can make 
assumptions that treatments move stands from closed canopy to open canopy (Table 2.4). 
Treatments do not affect mid- or late-successional stage transitions — the mid- and late-
successional transitions are surrogates for “age of stand” and are time dependent. A clear-cut 
treatment would move mid- or late-successional stands to early successional; however those are 
not typical of White Mountain Stewardship treatments.

Trends 
2013 White Mountain Stewardship treatments in the Lakeside District did move the forest along 
a trajectory toward less departed stands and more similar to historic conditions. The changes are 
very small, which is expected at the rate of treatments. All of the WMS treatments occurred in 
the ponderosa forest type, which evolved with frequent fire and is currently in much denser 
conditions across the Intermountain West today than historically. Treatments in these forests can 
have multiple benefits: fire risk reduction is a primary objective of WMS, but restoration 
objectives can also be met with small diameter tree removal and the creation of openings for a 
more diverse and resilient understory. 
 
Future Analysis 
The FRCC Departure Index is a landscape metric. As such, it is best assessed in large time 
frames, at least every five years. Knowledge of treatment effects is important to understand the 
transitions between successional stages. In addition, local data corrections to LANDFIRE data 
seem to be the best source for accurate successional stage determinations. We expect that some 
more recent R3 data layers may better inform this analysis, including the R3 Mid-scale 
Vegetation Analysis.  
 

16 
 
Additional Issues 
The use of a standardized index brings up a variety of concerns. Above, we clarified potential 
uses of a condition class analysis. A primary area of concern is the misconception that a 
Condition Class analysis is equivalent to a fire risk map; a CC analysis includes no information 
on fuels and is based entirely on overstory canopy information. (For more detail, see Safford and 
Schmidt’s Historic Reference Mapping for the Tahoe and Modoc NF, 2005, Region 3.)

3. Are patch sizes of denser (i.e., untreated or lightly treated) areas 
connected? What is the range of areas and sizes of these patches (WMSP 
monitoring question 8)? 
 
Joe Crouse and Dave Huffman 
 
Methods 
 
To address this monitoring question, we analyzed post-treatment forest canopy cover on six 
project areas (Task Orders, see Ch 1.) treated under the WMSP in 2014. We used Landsat 8 
imagery, Path 35, Row 36, acquired June 6, 2014. This imagery was the best (cloud and haze-
free) post-treatment dataset available. 
 
 
Project boundary spatial data layers provided by USFS were used to clip the Landsat 
scene. Canopy cover data collected during the 2014 field season were used to “train” a canopy 
cover classification performed with the imagery. We used this supervised classification to 
identify four canopy cover classes: 1) 1–20%, 2) 21–50%, 3) 51–80%, 4) 81–100% and 5) non-
forest. Classified maps were then analyzed using FRAGSTATS (McGarigal et al. 2012). Outputs 
examined to address the WMSP monitoring questions were average (area-weighted; see Turner 
et al. 2001), minimum, and maximum patch sizes. Because the monitoring question is focused on 
connectivity of “untreated or lightly treated areas,” we assumed that these were represented by 
patches of canopy cover class 3 and 4 (51–100%). In addition to the above patch metrics, we 
analyzed the proportion of the project area comprised of cover classes 3 and 4 and calculated an 
index of connectivity according to methods described in Turner et al. (2001). This index provides 
an estimate of the relative mean patch size and is calculated as: 
 
 
 
Ci = LCi / (pi * E) 
 
where Ci is connectivity index for patch type i; LCi is the size of the largest patch of type I; pi is 
the proportion of the landscape in patch type i, and E is the extent of the analyzed landscape. 
Thus, for any patch type, greater connectivity is indicated as Ci approaches 1.0 (relative patch 
size increases). Conversely, low connectivity is indicated by values of Ci close to 0 (dispersed 
smaller patches).

White Mountain Stewardship Project areas ranged 282–1,241 acres in size; most (67%) were less 
than 600 acres (Table 3.1). Mean patch size of cover classes 3 and 4 (51–100% cover) across all 
areas post-treatment ranged 0.2–4.7 acres. Eighty-three percent of the projects showed cover 
class 3 and 4 mean patch sizes of less than two acres (Table 3.1). Maximum cover class 3 and 4 
patch sizes ranged 0.8–9.5 acres. Sixty-seven percent of the sites showed maximum cover class 3 
and patch sizes less than seven acres with only one site greater than nine acres (Table 3.1). As a 
proportion of the project area extents, cover classes 3 and 4 made up 1.8–18.8%. Most (67%) 
project areas showed >5% in cover classes 3 and 4 (Table 3.1). Although some projects showed 
larger patch size, connectivity was generally low (Table 3.1). All connectivity index values were 
less than 0.39 (Table 3.1).

Discussion  
 
Connectivity of untreated and lightly treated areas was generally low (67% of the project areas 
had connectivity values of ≤ 0.16) across the WMS project areas treated in 2013. Low 
connectivity index values of cover class 3 and 4 (51–100% canopy cover) patches suggests that 
patches of this class were small and scattered. The Nobel and Quakie projects, with connectivity 
values of 0.39 and 0.35 respectively, were slightly less fragmented than the other project areas. 
The WMSP monitoring question addressed here implies that stakeholders desire connectivity of 
higher canopy cover areas, likely due to concerns over habitat of canopy-dependent wildlife 
species (Andrén 1994). For example, Prather et al. (2006) recommended patches of >395 acres 
where canopy cover is >40% be retained in forest treatment areas for tassel-eared squirrel 
recruitment in northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests.  
 
 
Although such considerations may seem overly focused on individual species and fail to 
acknowledge many other goals of ponderosa pine forest restoration (e.g., characteristic fire, 
understory plant production, soil processes, hydrologic function, etc.), little information is 
available concerning reference landscape patterns that may be used as guides for restoration 
treatments. Most information on canopy cover prior to Euro-American settlement and fire regime 
disruption has been summarized at scale of the site or tree group. For example, Sánchez Meador 
et al. (2011) reconstructed presettlement canopy cover on 2.5-acre ponderosa pine and pine-oak 
plots in northern Arizona and found cover ranged 10.2–18.8%. Similarly, White (1985) reported 
that canopy cover in presettlement ponderosa pine groups averaged 21.9%. No studies to date 
have documented presettlement high canopy cover in large patches.  
 
In summary, WMSP treatments retained untreated and lightly treated, higher canopy 
cover patches but these patches showed low connectivity across project areas. Although little 
information is available to guide restoration prescriptions at emulating natural landscape 
patterns, no research to date has indicated large patches of closed-canopied forest prior to 
historical fire regime disruption. Such high cover patches may provide high quality habitat for 
canopy dependent species such as tassel-eared squirrels, but retaining these patches may also 
compromise other restoration goals.

4. Are exotics/invasive species present at landings and burn piles 
(WMSP monitoring question 11)?  
 
Judy Springer and Rob Strahan 
 
Introduction 
 
Invasive non-native plant species may invade disturbed areas following tree thinning, prescribed 
burning, or wildfire due primarily to increased availability of resources (including sunlight, 
nutrients and moisture) and decreased competition. Most of these species are early successional 
or ruderal species and capitalize quickly on available resources. Determining if there are certain 
land management practices that are contributing to increased abundance or invasion of these 
species is key to modifying thinning and burning practices in an effort to decrease their spread 
following ecological restoration treatments.   
 
The original question asked by the White Mountain Stewardship Project Board was 
designed to determine if non-native invasive species were present at landings and burn piles. Due 
to the difficulty we encountered in 2012, when retrospectively identifying landings and slash 
piles following the Wallow Fire, the ERI modified the question to also examine if these species 
are more commonly found in the WMSP area in various microsites (type of ground cover and 
amount of sunlight), and in what density. The White Mountain Stewardship Project offered an 
opportunity to monitor for invasion on a landscape scale. 
 
Methods 
 
Monitoring Design 
Project areas, task orders, and sample plots used in this study are described above in Chapter 1 
(Chancellor et al. this report). Data were collected from two Forest Service Ranger Districts, 19 
cutting units, and 85 plots (three to six plots per cutting unit). Each plot (1 hectare in size) was 
established as a long-term monitoring plot, with a monumented center and a reference tree for 
relocating the center. On each randomly located plot, we measured overstory characteristics, 
surface fuels, and regeneration. We also conducted an assessment to determine if invasive non-
native species were present on the plot, and if so, we recorded microsite and a rough estimate of 
density and abundance of each subpopulation. Difficulty in retrospectively identifying slash piles 
and landings following wildfire led us to develop a methodology where microsite characteristics 
were evaluated at each occurrence of an invasive species. Microsite conditions included type of 
ground cover and amount of sunlight in the vicinity of non-native occurrences. 
 
From the plot center, we laid out a 100-m tape in all four cardinal directions to form four 
triangular quadrants, for a total plot area of 5,000 m2. We then searched each quadrant for the 
non-native species of concern (listed in Appendix A of this report), using roughly a 5 x 5-m unit 
in which to estimate density (low density = <10 individuals, medium density = 10–50 
individuals, high density = 50–100 individuals, and very high = >100 individuals). Observations 
were also recorded for the predominant microsite and whether the plants were clumped together 
(dense), uniformly distributed, scattered, or widely scattered. Photographs of plants or 
populations were collected for documentation, and specimens were collected to confirm 
identification.  
Species to be inventoried were obtained from the Field Guide to Noxious and Invasive 
Species Known to Occur or are Potentially Occurring on the Apache-Sitgreaves National 

22 
 
Forests (White 2008) (listed in Appendix A). Although included on the list of species of 
concern, Verbascum thapsus (common mullein) was not included in surveys because of its 
ubiquitous and generally ephemeral nature in aboveground vegetation on the landscape. In 
addition, we did not collect data on non-native species, such as Taraxacum officinale (common 
dandelion) that are not listed by the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest as a species of concern.  
 
Analysis 
To understand the scale at which invasive species were found we examined the data at both the 
district and cutting unit levels. For each level we calculated the percentage of plots on which a 
given species occurred at that level. We also calculated the average density of each species based 
on an ordinal variable ranging from 1 to 7. Each variable represents a density score describing 
densities ranging from occurrences of a single individual to 100+ individuals (i.e., unit density 
1=1, 2=2–5, 3=6–10, 4=11–25, 5=26–50, 6=51–100, 7=100+). For each species we calculated its 
average density per plot at the district and cutting unit level using the midpoint of each unit 
density score. 
 
Results 
 
Bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare), a prolific wind-dispersed species, was the most widespread 
invasive species, inventoried in 11 cutting units in both districts (Table 4.1). It was more 
concentrated in the Springerville District (8.2 plants per acre on average) than in Alpine (Table 
4.2). However, only a small area of the Alpine District was inventoried, comparatively. Bull 
thistle is fairly ubiquitous in the Springerville District in areas inventoried in 2014 and was found 
in a total of 19 plots in the district. The only areas where it was not widely scattered include the 
Burro cutting unit (Springerville 2), MCT (Springerville 54) and much of the Quakie cutting unit 
(Springerville 3, 4, and 10), although there was a population detected in Quakie cutting unit 1 
(plot 1).  
Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) was detected in all six plots of the Nobel 2 cutting unit 
(Alpine District). Density was very high in that cutting unit and averaged roughly 2,900 plants 
per acre in the Alpine District, although it was concentrated in Nobel 2. 
Musk thistle (Carduus nutans), a wind-dispersed species, was widely scattered in Nobel 
2, 4, and 6 in the Alpine District and Springerville HA 7 and 9 and Springerville MCT 47 and 63 
in the Springerville District. Goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica) has not been detected in previous 
years, but it was recorded in three plots in 2014 in the Alpine Nobel 2 cutting unit. Erodium 
cicutarium (common stork’s-bill) was mostly concentrated in Alpine Nobel 4 and 6, but there 
were a few scattered occurrences in other plots. Common purslane (Portulaca oleracea) was 
recorded in only one plot in the Springerville District. Although this species was listed as a 
species of concern, there is strong evidence indicating it was present in North America in pre-
Columbian times (Byrne and McAndrews 1975).

Overall, Nobel 2 (Alpine District) had the highest diversity and density of invasive 
species, with four species recorded. MCT 62 (Springerville) also had high diversity (five species 
recorded). The Quakie cutting unit had the lowest density and occurrences of non-native species, 
with bull thistle recorded on only one plot. 
 
Although at least one occurrence of an invasive species was recorded on every plot in the 
Alpine District (Table 4.2), no invasive plants were recorded on 75% of plots in the Springerville 
District. Densities of all species were also quite low in that district.

Most recorded occurrences of invasive species were either in full sun or partial sun. The 
majority of invasives were recorded in areas of full sun and bare mineral soil (Table 4.3), but a 
substantial amount of invasives were found in areas of partial sun and a mix of litter and bare 
soil. Non-natives were found in predominately shaded areas only 2% of the time in the Alpine 
District. As mentioned earlier, previous evidence of slash piles is difficult to detect in areas that 
have been burned. Invasive species were located on landings 1.4% of the time in the 
Springerville District. No invasives were detected in areas where current or former slash piles 
were located, in either district. However, this finding could be a result of a low number of 
landings or slash piles occurring in the plots (invasives were encountered on only two landings, 
and no invasives were recorded on areas with evidence of slash piles). In contrast, invasives were 
recorded much of the time in areas that had been thinned, where logging slash was apparent 
(18% of occurrences in the Alpine District and 51% of occurrences in the Springerville District).

Cheatgrass, musk thistle and common stork’s-bill were most commonly found in areas 
with evidence of recent burning (99%, 79%, and 89% of the time, respectively). Bull thistle was 
recorded in burned areas 15% of the time. An average of 29% of recorded invasives were found 
on skid trails or roads across both districts. Invasive species found next to nurse objects were 
relatively infrequent. There were only two recorded instances of invasives adjacent to a boulder 
and 11 occurrences next to a log.  
 
Discussion 
 
Through our monitoring efforts, we observed non-native invasive species growing primarily in 
areas with full sun and on bare mineral soil. Since we collected microsite data only in the vicinity 
of occurrences of invasive plant species, inferences cannot be made about the microsites where 
these species were not found. In other words, there may be relevant microsite characteristics that 
preclude the establishment of non-native plant species that we could not identify through our 
monitoring, since we did not collect data in areas that were devoid of invasive species.  
Bull thistle is widely scattered throughout the study area. Seed production in this species is fairly 
prolific with hundreds of seeds per flowerhead, and possibly hundreds of heads per plant. Seeds 
fall to the ground around adult plants in downy masses, from which they are easily dispersed by 
the wind. Our monitoring of microsites in 2014 indicated that these wind-dispersed seeds are 
probably captured by slash, litter, logs and soil depressions. However, we have no way of 
determining if bull thistle was present prior to tree thinning.  
 
 
Following wildfires and ecological restoration activities of thinning and prescribed 
burning, adult bull thistle plants do not remain for long in the aboveground vegetation. However, 
it is quite possible that this species will form a persistent soil seed bank, which may allow plants 
to colonize an area following soil disturbance. According to the Fire Effects Information System 
(Zouhar 2002b), there is some evidence to indicate that deeply buried seeds experience induced 
dormancy and break dormancy when exposed to sunlight. Regardless of the mechanism of 
invasion at a site, whether it is through wind-dispersal or from a buried seed bank, the presence 
of bull thistle should be expected following thinning and burning activities across the landscape.  

26 
 
 
Cheatgrass is particularly prevalent in the Nobel 2 cutting unit, primarily in recently 
burned areas. According to Zouhar (2003), cheatgrass can establish from seeds stored in the soil 
or transported on-site. It is also well-known to be highly adapted to a frequent fire regime.  
 
Like bull thistle, musk thistle was widely scattered. This species also produces copious 
amounts of seed and establishes easily in high light environments (Zouhar 2002a). Conditions 
following fire are favorable to its establishment, and incidents of rapid colonization after fire 
suggest that seeds may be stored in soil and germinate after the overstory is removed, as well as 
possibly being transported on-site (Zouhar 2002a). 
 
 
Key Findings 
 
 Most recorded occurrences of invasive species were either in full sun or partial sun. 
No invasives were found in predominantly shaded microsites.  
 The majority of invasives were recorded in areas of full sun and bare soil, but 
invasives were also found in areas of partial sun and litter as the predominant 
ground cover.  
 Most occurrences of invasive species (with the exception of bull thistle) were 
recorded in recently burned areas. 
 Less than 2% of the recorded occurrences of invasives were from areas with 
evidence of landings or slash piles, but 14% of occurrences of invasive species were 
recorded on roads or skid trails.
