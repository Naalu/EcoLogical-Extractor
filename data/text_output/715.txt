Accomplishments 
· 
Summary:  Sixty-six of the approximately 140 original historical plots (or 47%) have 
been relocated on eight National Forests thus far.  Of these 66 relocated plots – 0 (0/13) 
are spruce-fir, 13 (13/29) are mixed conifer, and the remainder 53 (53/98) are dominated 
by ponderosa pine (at least historically pine dominated).  This study focused on the 
ponderosa pine-dominated plots, of which we have relocated over 54%.  NOTE:  This 
total does NOT include those historical plots located on the Long Valley Experimental 
Forest near Clint’s Well, AZ. 
· 
Total historical plots remeasured since 1997 is now 22 (22/98 or 22%); of these, 20 plots 
were stem-mapped (x,y locations of all trees ≥ 9.14 cm DBH) on four National Forests. 
· 
Remeasurement (1.01 ha subplots) of six additional historical plots occurred during this 
project period (CIBS1B, COCS5B1, COCS5B2, COCS5C1, COCS5E2, PECS1A); 
Another subplot, COCS3A, was burned in 2000 and a new subplot was relocated within 
the larger plot.  
· 
Five-year remeasurement of six 1.01 ha subplots was also completed during this period 
(CIBS1A, CIBS2A, COCS1A, COCS1B, COCS2A, COCS2B) 
· 
Remeasurement and remapping of entire plot extent for four historical plots: COCS1A 
(2.6 ha), COCS5B1 (1.9 ha), COCS5B2 (1.2 ha), COCS5C1(1.2 ha); the full extent of 
COCS1B, COCS2A, COCS2B, COCS4A (3.2 ha), COCS4B (3.2 ha), COCS5A2 (1.2 
ha), and COCS5B3 (1.2 ha) are scheduled to be mapped this summer (2004).  Stem-
mapped data over large areas such as these will be used to analyze spatial patterns for 
ponderosa pine on a variety of soil types. 
· 
Remeasurement of three historical subplots that burned in wildfires of 2000:  The 
subplots, located in Arizona (a portion of COCS3A and all of COCS3B subplot burned in 
the Pipe Fire) and New Mexico (JEMS2A burned in the Cerro Grande Fire); all three had 
been re-measured (1998-1999) before the wildfires occurred.  All three plots were 
remeasured one-year (2001) post-burn; and again three years (2003) post-burn.  Data are 
currently being analyzed for burn severity and recovery.  Also, modified Whittaker plots 
were sampled on the burns in 2001; modified Whittaker plots on COCS3A and COCS3B 
were remeasured (and sample size increased) in 2003. 
· 
Continued data entry of historical ledger data (1909 till late 1930s-1940s for all 21 plots); 
ledger data entry completed for all years for COCS1A; we continue to enter ledger data 
for other plots and dates. 
· 
Continued analysis and development of forest overstory reconstruction model.  Growth 
rates are being analyzed before and after initial harvest on plots.  
· 
Data collection for model refinement includes: DBH vs. DGH (diameter at ground 
height) relationships; and decay rates (size data on dead material) 
· 
Continued development of macro to visualize stands at different ages using known spatial 
coordinates of trees using the SVS computer program.

· 
Data collection and initial analyses on permanent herbaceous understory plots includes  
remeasurement of 102 permanent herbaceous understory plots (each 1.5 x 3.0 m) 
established in 1914 on eight intensive overstory plots in Arizona.  Mapped spatial  
locations of plants on 20 of these plots.  Mapped spatial locations of herbaceous plants on 
11 plots (each 1 x 1 m) on Woolsey plot COCS3B- recovery from burn.  Located 48 of 
60 understory plots (each 1 x 1 m) at 5 sites around Flagstaff (the ‘Hill plots’); mapped 
spatial locations of plants on all plots. 
· 
Entered ± 800 historical images into the Fort Valley Experimental Station collection on 
the Rocky Mountain Research Station (RMRS) image database; these images have been 
uploaded onto a USFS website (http://www.rmrs.nau.edu/imagedb/index.shtml) to be 
visited by managers and scientists interested in reference conditions and historical 
ecology.

Executive Summary 
In this study, we relocated and remeasured a subset of the oldest known forest inventory 
plots in the American Southwest, established between 1909-1920s in Arizona and New Mexico.  
We used a combination of dendroecological and repeat forest inventory approaches to evaluate 
changes of forest structure and ecosystem function at decadal scales. 
Sixty-six of the approximately 140 original historical plots (or 47%) have been relocated 
on eight National Forests thus far.  Of these, 66 plots – 0 (0/13) are spruce-fir, 13 (13/29) are 
mixed conifer, and the remainder (53/98) are dominated by ponderosa pine; 31 plots are less than 
0.2 ha (0.5 ac).  This study focused on the ponderosa pine-dominated plots, of which we have 
relocated over 54%.  Twenty-two plots (22%) were relocated and remeasured between 1997-
2003 on four National Forests in Arizona and New Mexico.  Fifteen of these 22 plots from both 
AZ and NM are our most complete data set to-date and were used to evaluate changes in forest 
structure and reconstruction techniques (Objectives 2, 3, 4).  In addition, one plot (COCS1A) was 
used as a prototype to model structure temporally and examine indicators of ecosystem change 
(biomass, nutrients, fire susceptibility) (Objective 5) and quantify spatial patterns (Objective 6).  
Tree structural remains are important in forest reconstruction to determine fire history 
and structural characteristics of past stand conditions (Fulé et al. 1997, Mast et al. 1999); or to 
determine the effects of partial cutting on tree composition and stand growth (Deal and Tappeiner 
2002).  The precision of these analyses is highly dependent on field identification of 
presettlement evidence, dendrochronological proficiency, and relationships utilized in "reverse" 
growth and decay modeling.  We recognize former tree structures (e.g., snags, stumps, down logs, 
stump hole) in the field with a high degree of precision (Moore et al. 2004), however, a large 
source of error was linked to the imprecise reconstruction of tree diameters to their former size.  
In addition, overestimation of tree sizes, coupled with uncertainties about death/cut dates, lead to 
overestimates of past tree density in this study.  We reduced these errors by using historical 
ledger accounts of death dates, but our reconstruction model still resulted in size overestimations. 
Overstory structure on COCS1A has changed significantly between 1876 and 2002.  A 
selective harvest in 1894 significantly reduced the stand density, total basal area (BA), and 
quadratic mean diameter.  Since plot establishment in 1909, density and BA have increased to 
levels greatly exceeding those found in 1876.  Canopy cover, overstory biomass, leaf area index, 
overstory nutrients, and forest floor depth are predicted to have increased as BA increased.  
Levels of all of these variables in 2002 exceeded the predicted levels in 1876.  Understory 
production is predicted to have declined as BA increased, and was lower in 2002 than at any other 
date.  In 2002, the overstory was dominated by small trees (< 20 cm DBH), many of which first 
grew to a height of 40 cm between 1900 and 1939.  The crowning indices rose at harvest in 1894, 
and then decreased over time.  Reduced crowning indices reflect higher potential to support an 
active crown fire, because the wind speed needed to carry a fire through the crown was lowered.  
The spatial pattern differences between the historical (1909-reconstructed [as if 
harvesting had not occurred in 1894] and 1909-actual) and contemporary (2002) data sets on 
COCS1A were pronounced.  Historically, this site exhibited dense clumps of trees averaging 0.02 
ha in size alternating with sparsely populated interspaces between clumps.  The partial harvest in 
1894 homogenized the plot with respect to tree size by removing many of the largest diameter 
trees and changing the amount and distribution of tree sizes across the plot.  At fine scales, the 
size of clumps was largely unaffected by harvesting; while at coarser scales, the clumpiness of the 
residual trees was increased because the harvest removed all of the trees in large patches.  In 
2002, the pattern was characterized by clumps that span large areas with few interspaces.   
The tree harvests of the late 19th and early 20th century, together with fire exclusion, 
overgrazing, and climate change, altered the trajectory of stand development, ecosystem function, 
and spatial pattern of ponderosa pine stands in northern Arizona.  Managers interested in 
reference conditions or restoration treatments should incorporate these historical factors in their 
decision making.

Project Title 
 
Quantifying Forest Reference Conditions for Ecological Restoration: The “Woolsey” Plots 
 
Introduction 
 
Coniferous forest ecosystems of the Southwest have undergone dramatic changes in 
forest structure since Anglo-American and Hispanic settlement of the region , particularly in the 
ponderosa pine type (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws. var. scopulorum) (Cooper 1960, Stein 
1988, Covington and Moore 1994a, 1994b, Heinlein 1996, Fulé et al. 1997, Mast et al. 1999).  
Structural and functional changes in ponderosa pine and lower mixed conifer systems were driven 
by an irruption of pine and fire-intolerant tree species regeneration resulting from disruption of 
the frequent, low-intensity fire regime, livestock overgrazing, and high-grade logging (Pearson 
1910, Arnold 1950, Cooper 1960, Stein 1988, Savage and Swetnam 1990, Savage 1991, 
Covington and Moore 1994b, Swetnam and Baisan 1996, Heinlein 1996).  Ecologists and natural 
resource professionals generally agree that these changes have occurred and continue to occur 
throughout North America's frequent fire ecosystems; however, surprisingly little quantitative 
information is available about the magnitude and extent of these changes (Covington et al. 1994).  
Forest reconstruction techniques, which include dendroecological analysis of live and dead trees, 
suggest that tree densities on pine and pine-oak study sites in northern Arizona increased 2-7 
times since EuroAmerican settlement (Covington and Moore 1994b, Fulé et al. 1997, Mast et al. 
1999).  Similar increases in tree numbers were reported for forests throughout the southwestern 
region (Johnson 1994).  
In this study, we relocated and remeasured a subset of the oldest known forest inventory 
plots in the American Southwest, established from 1909-1920s in Arizona and New Mexico.  We 
focused on those plots dominated by ponderosa pine.  We used a combination of 
dendroecological and repeat forest inventory approaches to evaluate changes of forest structure 
and ecosystem function at decadal scales (Biondi 1999).  Historical records in the USFS Rocky 
Mountain Station - Fort Valley archives allowed detailed comparisons between historical and 
present-day forest attributes.  Information from historical, permanent plot research provides 
valuable data on forest dynamics prior to contemporary management practices and can help 
describe the natural range of forest structure (Minnich et al. 1995, Biondi 1996, Biondi 1999, 
Kipfmueller and Swetnam 2001).  These data can, in turn, be used to evaluate ecological changes 
and guide management prescriptions (Kauffmann et al. 1994, Morgan et al. 1994, Landres et al. 
1999, Moore et al. 1999, Kipfmueller and Swetnam 2001).  
  
Objectives 
Specific objectives of this research project were to: 
1. Relocate permanent plots; remeasure a subset of ponderosa pine-dominated permanent plots 
established in the early 1900s so as to achieve an adequate sample size, and thus be able to 
analyze this unique data source.  
2. Quantify forest structural (tree density, size, and age) and compositional differences on a 
subset (n=15) of permanent plots between the original plot establishment date (1909-1913) and 
our remeasurement date (1997 – 1999).  These data were collected in 1997-99, but information 
was not published.  Publication in a refereed journal was an objective of this study.  
3.  Reconstruct forest structure on a subset of plots at its establishment date (1909-1913) using 
dendrochronological techniques.  Compare the reconstructed (modeled) and the historical (actual) 
forest structure for each plot to determine the precision, errors, and limitations of our 
reconstruction techniques and models.   
4.  Reconstruct forest structure at the date of fire exclusion (circa 1876-1890), showing forest 
structural conditions at the time of disruption of the long-term, frequent-fire regime (a.k.a. 

 
 
 
 
7
presettlement).  Compare species composition, tree densities and size distributions to 1909-1913 
and contemporary conditions. 
5.  Use the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS; Teck et al. 1996) to determine and link stand 
structural changes with functional changes (tree biomass, carbon and nitrogen storage, 
herbaceous production, fire susceptibility, etc.) on one prototype plot (COCS1A) from the time of 
fire regime disruption (circa 1876) and initial plot establishment (1909) until the present.              
6.  Compare basic spatial pattern changes on one prototype plot (COCS1A) from initial plot 
establishment to present. 
 
Background 
In 1909, T.S. Woolsey, Jr., Assistant District Forester and Chief of the Office of 
Silviculture, District 3 (Southwestern District now Southwest Region 3), USFS; and G. A. 
Pearson, Director, Fort Valley Forest Experiment Station (Flagstaff, AZ), USFS, drafted a set of 
instructions that led to establishment of a network of permanent plots in ponderosa pine, mixed 
conifer, and spruce-fir forests of the Southwest (Pearson 1910, Woolsey 1911, Woolsey 1912).  
Between 1909 and the early 1920s (2 plots established in 1933, 1940, respectively), 
approximately 82 plots ranging in size from two to six hectares (ha) “intensive plots” to larger 32 
ha “extensive plots” were established to evaluate stand growth, commercial potential, and natural 
regeneration of ponderosa pine, mixed conifer, and spruce-fir stands (Woolsey 1911, Pearson 
1923, 1933).  Approximately, 72% (59 of 82) of these plots were located in the ponderosa pine 
type of Arizona and New Mexico (Table 1.1).   
An important criterion for plot establishment included location on areas where a timber 
sale had occurred within the last five years that followed current (early 1900) national forest 
harvest practices.  Harvests may have been by a private timber company prior to or may have 
occurred simultaneously with plot establishment.  In either case, the harvest must have followed 
the general practice in the national forests in which one-third of the merchantable volume was 
left, mainly in the form of immature trees (Pearson 1933).  “So-called sample plots were 
established on logged over areas in order to ascertain how fast residual stands would grow, 
whether they could produce merchantable timber, and whether natural restocking would take 
place” (Pearson 1933, p. 272).   
All live conifers ≥ 9.14 cm (3.6 in) diameter at breast height (DBH; 1.37 m or 4.5 ft) 
were measured and, for 20 plots, the spatial locations of all trees were recorded (stem-mapped).  
Data were recorded only for conifers that were commercially valuable in the early 1900s, 
although other species occurred on the site. Additional data recorded included species, age class, 
height, diameter, and condition class.  Also, the location and diameter of standing dead trees, 
logs, and cut stumps were recorded on several plots. 
 
General Methods 
 
Study Area 
 
The study area for this report included the network of 140 original permanent plots on the 
National Forests of Arizona and New Mexico (USFS Southwestern Region; now USFS Region 
3).  Between 1997 and 2002, we used historical descriptions of plot locations and searched these 
areas for original tree tags and monumented plot corners.  Sixty-six of the approximately 140 
original historical plots (or 47%) have been relocated on eight National Forests thus far.  Of these 
66 plots – 0 (0/13) are spruce-fir, 13 (13/29) are mixed conifer, and the remainder 53 (53/98) are 
dominated by ponderosa pine (or at least historically dominated).  Thirty-one of the original 140 
plots are less than 0.2 ha (0.5 ac) in size.  This study focused on the ponderosa pine-dominated 
plots, of which we have relocated over 54%.  NOTE:  This total does NOT include those 
historical plots located on the Long Valley Experimental Forest near Clint’s Well, AZ.

Out of the 53 pine-dominated plots we were able to relocate during this period, we 
selected a subset for remeasurement and detailed analysis.  Criteria used for selecting the subset 
for analyses were: 1) historical stem map (tree locations) existed, 2) overstory trees were 
historically dominated by ponderosa pine (≥ 70% of the plot BA in the early 1900s), and 3) in 
cases of extreme disturbance (e.g., roads, urban development, etc.) that a minimally disturbed 
1.01 ha subplot could be captured.  We accepted plots that had received a precommercial or 
selective thin or light surface fire.  We identified 21 plots that met all criteria thus far (including 
had stem map), and 22 plots have been remeasured to-date (Objective 1).  General plot locations 
are located in Fig. 1.1 and Table 1.1.  Fifteen of these 22 plots from both AZ and NM are our 
most complete data set to-date and were used to evaluate changes in forest structure and 
reconstruction techniques (Objectives 2, 3, 4).  Descriptions and disturbance history of these 15 
plots are listed in Table 1.2.  The Arizona plots (COC prefix) examined in this study fall within 
the Colorado Plateau physiographic region, while the New Mexico plots fall within two 
physiographic regions, the southern tip of Southern Rocky Mountains (JEM plots), and Basin and 
Range (GILA).  The CIB plots, located southwest of Magdelena, NM, lie in an interesting 
transition zone between the Colorado Plateau to the north and the Basin and Range to the south 
(Chronic 1987).  The plots examined in detail for this study represented six ponderosa pine 
habitat types of the Southwest (Moir 2000).  
Field Measurements 
We used survey and forest inventory methods originally employed at plot establishment 
in the early 1900s.  Historical stem maps were used to reestablish the original plot layout of 
continuous 1 chain by 1 chain quadrats (0.04 ha or 0.10-ac; Fig.1.2).  Most of the original plot 
corners and many of the interior markers were evident and aided in plot reestablishment.  In order 
to achieve our secondary objective without bias, the historical maps were not consulted again 
until contemporary measurements were completed.  This allowed us to test our ability to locate 
and identify structural evidence of the former stand after 80+ years of change.  
The original plots examined for this study were “intensive” plots; therefore, they ranged 
in size from 2.0 to 6.1 ha in size.  We standardized remeasurement by delineating one 1.01-ha 
(2.5 ac) subplot within each historical plot. Each subplot was subdivided into 25 grid cells, each 
cell was one square chain (20.1 x 20.1 m; 0.10 acre; or 66 ft on the side), which duplicated the 
original plot layout and facilitated remeasurement.  The 1.01 ha subplot will hereafter be referred 
to as “plot”.  An area of 1.01 ha: 1) ensured that presettlement ponderosa pine tree groups (0.1 to 
0.3 ha in size; White 1985) were captured in the data, 2) reduced edge effect thereby minimizing 
problems of comparisons with the historically mapped data, and 3) allowed remeasurement of a 
relatively large unit within time and funding constraints.  For consistency, the northwest corner of 
the original plot was randomly selected as the origin for establishment of each contemporary plot.  
If this corner was disturbed, then alternate origins were selected by progressing clockwise to 
successive corners of the same plot. 
Grid cells within each 1.01 ha plot were searched and all evidence of living or dead tree 
structures, either presently or at some past time reaching at least 1.37 m height, were numbered 
and tagged. Structures included live trees, snags, logs, stumps, and stump holes.  Species, DBH, 
and condition class (1-9; see below) were recorded for all structures.  Diameters were measured at 
DBH to the nearest tenth of an inch with a diameter tape and then converted to metric units.  If 
the original tree tag still existed, however, we measured diameter at the nail and tag.   
Trees were cored at 40 cm above ground level to determine tree age.  Ponderosa pine, 
Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco), white fir (Abies concolor 
Gord. & Glend.), limber pine (Pinus flexilis James), or southwestern white pine (Pinus 
strobiformis Engelm.) with DBH ≥ 37 cm or ponderosa pine of any size with yellowed bark 
(White 1985, Mast et al. 1999) were considered potentially presettlement trees or at least 
established at the time of original plot establishment.  All living potentially presettlement or

original plot establishment trees were cored for determination of age and past size.  Trees that 
established after the original plot establishment date were randomly sampled at a sampling rate 
that averaged 20%. 
Tree condition classes followed a classification system commonly used in ponderosa pine 
forests (Maser et al. 1979, Thomas et al. 1979).  The nine classes were:  1) live, 2) fading, 3) 
recently dead, 4) loose bark snag, 5) clean snag, 6) snag broken above breast height, 7) snag 
broken below breast height, 8) dead and down, 9) cut stump, and 10) stump hole (class added in 
2000). 
The spatial location of each tree was measured using a criterion laser.   
 
Definitions 
To make the best comparisons possible with the historical data, tree structures were 
classified into broad age classes (Table 1.3).  We used the descriptions provided by White (1985) 
to classify trees as postsettlement and presettlement in origin. These classifications were thought 
to correspond well with Woolsey’s (1911) description of trees as “blackjack” and “yellow pine”, 
respectively.  Woolsey (1911; p. 5-6) wrote, “Blackjack is merely the form which yellow pine 
assumes before it reaches 125 or 150 years, during which period its bark is dark red-brown or 
blackish, with narrow furrows, in strong contrast to the lighter, widely furrowed bark of mature 
trees”. 
 
Location of Historically Measured Trees 
When remeasurement was completed, we used the original maps to systematically visit 
the location of each historically measured tree and evaluate our success in locating these same 
trees after 80 - 90 years.  We identified historically measured trees on the basis of their mapped 
locations in conjunction with the bark characteristics, sizes of trees, and presence of historical tree 
tags.  Historically measured trees that were missed during remeasurement were recorded and 
notes were made regarding tree attributes (historical and current) or condition classes (e.g., live, 
dead and down, no evidence).  Hereafter, these trees are labeled “missing”. 
 
 
Analyses and Results 
 
 
NOTE:  Analyses, results and discussion are described separately for each 
study objective below.  More specific methods are also added to each objective when 
necessary. 
 
Objective 1:  Relocate permanent plots; remeasure a subset of the permanent plots 
so as to achieve an adequate sample size  
 
Analyses:  no specific analysis for this objective. 
 
 
Results and Discussion:  Sixty-six of the approximately 140 original historical plots (or 47%) 
have been relocated on eight National Forests thus far.  Of these 66 plots – 0 (0/13) are spruce-fir, 
13 (13/29) are mixed conifer, and the remainder 53 (53/98) are dominated by ponderosa pine (or 
at least historically dominated).  This study focused on the ponderosa pine-dominated plots, of 
which we have relocated over 54%.   
  Of these ponderosa pine plots, 30% (29/98) are located in a cluster approximately 35 km 
southwest of Flagstaff, AZ (known as the COCS5 or Coulter Ranch plots; Table 1.1). In addition, 
thirty-one of the original 140 plots are less than 0.2 ha (0.5 ac) in size (99% are ponderosa pine) 
(Table 1.1); we have not and probably will not focus much attention on these small plots.   

 
 
 
 
10
Twenty-two ponderosa pine-dominated plots were relocated and remeasured (22/98 or 
22%) between 1997-2002 on four National Forests in Arizona and New Mexico; of these, twenty 
plots were stem-mapped.  Five-year remeasurements have occurred on six plots (originally 
relocated and measured in 1997-1998; and remeasured in 2002-2003).  Three plots remeasured in 
1998 were burned in wildfires in 2000 so we collected 1- and 3-year post-burn measurements to 
track individual tree response to crown fire.  Fifteen of these 22 plots are our most complete data 
set to-date; and this complete set was used to evaluate changes in forest structure and 
reconstruction techniques (see objectives 2, 3, 4) for this study.  In addition, one plot (COCS1A) 
was used as a prototype to model structure temporally and to examine indicators of ecosystem 
change (biomass, selected nutrients, fire susceptibility, etc.) (see objective 5) and to quantify 
spatial patterns (see objective 6).  
 
Objective 2: Structural and compositional changes on 15 plots in AZ and NM  
 
Woolsey plot data were collected from 1997-1999 on 15 plots in Arizona and New 
Mexico as part of a project funded by the USFS Rocky Mountain Research Station - Research 
Joint Venture (JV) Agreement 28-JV7-939.  Data collection and preliminary analyses were 
reported as part of a USFS JV agreement (Moore et al. 2000).  Error correction, final data 
analyses, and manuscript publication (Moore et al. 2004) were part of the deliverables for this 
study and final report.  Please see abstract below.  A reprint of the manuscript will be forwarded 
to the Ecological Restoration Institute when it arrives in April, 2004.

Abstract.  We compared historical (1909-1913) and contemporary (1997-1999) forest 
structure and composition on 15 permanent plots in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex 
Laws.) forests of Arizona and New Mexico.  We used the same sampling methods as in the early 
1900s and compared stand density, diameter distributions, species composition, and broad age-
classes from the two periods.  Stand density (trees ≥ 9.14 cm DBH) significantly (p < 0.001) 
increased on plots from an average of 77.4 trees per plot (s = 49.9) at plot establishment in 1909-
1913 to 519.1 trees per plot (s = 252.3) at remeasurement in 1997-1999.  Basal area significantly 
(p < 0.001) increased from 8.0 m2 per plot (s = 3.5) to 28.5 m2 per plot (s = 10.1).  Contemporary 
tree diameter distribution shifted towards smaller size classes as demonstrated by a significant (p 
= 0.001) decrease in quadratic mean diameter from 38.5 cm (s = 7.5) in 1909-1913 to 28.6 cm (s 
= 7.1) in 1997-1999.  Broad age-classes yielded an average of 61.5 (s = 49.5) residual live trees 
classified as “blackjack” ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa < 150 yrs) and 13.3 (s = 11.9) “yellow 
pine” (P. ponderosa ≥ 150 yrs) in 1909-1913.  In 1997-1999, 416 live trees (s = 229.6) were 
“blackjack” and 57.2 (s = 28.5) trees on average were “yellow pine”.  Twelve of the 15 plots were 
not invaded by other tree species (remained pure ponderosa pine type), while composition shifted 
slightly on three plots towards more shade-tolerant and fire-intolerant species.  Ninety-one 
percent of the historically (1909-1913 or older) mapped tree structures (live trees, snags, logs, 
stumps, etc.) were relocated, which suggested that the forest reconstruction field techniques are 
reliable within 10%.  Dramatic increases in tree densities may represent an increased potential for 
bark beetle epidemics and stand replacing wildfire over large areas in the Southwest.

Objective 3:  Reconstruction of forest structure at plot establishment on 15 plots in 
AZ and NM;   and  
 
Objective 4:  Reconstruction of presettlement structure on 15 plots in AZ and NM  
 
 
By:  A. J. Sánchez Meador and D. W. Huffman 
 
Background and Methods:   Tree structural remains are important in forest 
reconstruction to determine fire history and structural characteristics of past stand conditions 
(Fulé et al. 1997, Mast et al. 1999); or to determine the effects of partial cutting on tree 
composition and stand growth (Deal and Tappeiner 2002).  The precision of these analyses is 
highly dependent on field identification of presettlement evidence, dendrochronological 
proficiency, and relationships utilized in "reverse" growth and decay modeling.  While a potential 
source of error in stand reconstruction approaches is the failure to recognize the evidence of 
former tree structures or locations in the field (e.g., snags, stumps, down logs, stump hole, etc.), 
additional error can be linked to the imprecise reconstruction tree diameters to their former size.  
These types of errors could lead to over- or underestimates in tree sizes and incorrect estimates of 
pre- or postsettlement forest stand densities (Fulé et al. 1997, Mast et al. 1999, Moore et al. 
2004).  Our objective in this portion of the study was to use contemporary data from historically 
measured forest plots in Arizona and New Mexico from 1909-1913, combined with historical 
data and accounts of past harvesting activities, to reconstruct stand conditions at plot 
establishment (1909 – 1913) and fire exclusion dates (1876 – 1890), and then to test the precision 
of our forest reconstruction techniques. Specifically, we wanted to compare our reconstructed 
stand conditions at plot establishment to those recorded in the historical data in an effort to 
identify and quantify estimate error.  
We reconstructed forest structural conditions at the date of plot establishment (Objective 
3), and at the approximate date of fire exclusion (Objective 4).  Reconstruction techniques used in 
southwestern ponderosa pine forests include field identification of tree structural evidence (snags, 
logs, stumps, etc.), dendrochronological measurement of increment cores from stumps, logs, and 
living trees, direct measurement of remnant woody evidence, backwards radial growth modeling 
(Fulé et al. 1997), and decomposition modeling (Rogers et al. 1984).  
Previously, Moore et al. (2000, 2004) found that relocating mapped and recorded trees 
from subplots established between 1909 through 1913 had an associated error rate of 5.7% for 
Arizona and 11.5% for New Mexico subplots. The majority of the missed trees were small (< 
30.0 cm DBH in 1909 – 1913) for all subplots (AZ: 78%, NM: 85%). Additionally, many of the 
missed trees had died before our remeasurements (AZ: 66%, NM: 47%).  It was also found that 
many of the missed trees existed as highly decomposed structures (i.e., stump holes). 
Diameter reconstruction of historical trees that were still alive on Arizona and New 
Mexico subplots at remeasurement overestimated DBH by an average of 11.9 % and 1.7%, 
respectively.  Moore et al. (2000) also reported large errors (> 60 %) for diameter reconstruction 
of trees for which increment data were unavailable (rotten tree centers, incomplete cores, etc) and 
considered this result “unexpected.” Further investigation leads one to believe this phenomenon 
may be a result of the regression equation (ERI Grand Canyon National Park experimental block 
data collected in January 1998, n = 315, r2 = 0.45; Fulé et al. 2002) used to grow these trees 
backward in time.  In addition, the equations developed by Fulé et al. (2002) were developed to 
model growth of mature trees (based on data from trees ≥ 100 yrs up to several hundred yrs) for 
presettlement tree reconstruction; and it is likely that these older trees grow more slowly than the  
younger trees that potentially dominated the Woolsey plots.

Diameter reconstruction of trees that died (natural mortality or harvesting) after plot 
establishment (1909-1913) can be problematic.  Often the error associated with reconstructing 
dead structures is unknown; however the use of long-term plots can make us aware of the 
magnitude and trend of these errors.  Error for diameter reconstruction of trees that were alive at 
plot establishment but were snags and dead and downed at remeasurement was previously 
computed for the Arizona and New Mexico subplots (Moore 2000). For Arizona subplots, the 
reconstructed size of these trees was overestimated by 1.5% when moved through decay classes 
at the 50th percentile rate. Using the same methods, New Mexico trees were underestimated by 
7.9% for the 25th decay percentile.  
One of the largest difficulties encountered when reconstructing past stand conditions is 
estimating death date of trees harvested after plot establishment (1909 – 1913) that have 
undergone years of decomposition.  When these plots were initially established, the original 
intent was to harvest each subplot only once prior to or simultaneous with plot establishment 
(Woolsey 1911). Unfortunately, this was not the case and some plots received multiple harvests 
after establishment (Moore et al. 2004). We utilized historical records and additional ledger data 
to determine the most accurate death date for each tree and then incorporated these into the 
modeled reconstructions for each Arizona and New Mexico subplots (Table 3.1).  We assigned 
trees to their correct death dates on the basis of 1) lists of tree numbers cut (intermediate 
harvests), and 2) physical characteristics of stumps (diameter, stump height, cutting method, etc). 
 
Results and Discussions: Reconstruction of Plot Establishment Structures:  The 
resulting density, size characteristics, and error associated with assignment of cut dates are 
summarized in Table 3.2 for the reconstructions incorporating more accurate cut dates (Modeled). 
Reconstructed subplot densities were higher than those recorded on historical maps. Total number 
of reconstructed trees on subplots represents the sum of: (1) historically measured trees, (2) trees 
historically existing on subplots yet too small (< 9.14 cm) to be mapped at original plot 
establishment, (3) trees that had died or had been cut prior to plot establishment, and (4) large live 
trees for which no increment core existed.  Thus, if a tree’s DBH was overestimated when 
reconstructed to 1909-1913 then that tree was included in the plot totals for tree size and density, 
when in reality it would have been too small in 1909-1913 to have been measured. 
The reconstructions of the Arizona plots resulted in plot density overestimates of 21-162 
trees per subplot (Table 3.2: Modeled) even with the more accurate harvest date information. 
Since the harvested trees’ death dates were determined, the resulting overestimation must have 
come from snags and dead and downed trees for which death dates were inaccurately estimated, 
and from the backwards radial growth modeling of reconstructed dead material and large live 
trees for which no increment data was available. Furthermore, the regression equation used 
increases the error associated with the decomposition estimates and confounds determining if the 
true source of the overestimation is tree size. We are confident that assigning the correct tree 
death dates increased the accuracy of the number of trees reconstructed at plot establishment, but 
it must be noted that this resulted in larger errors associated with those trees’ sizes than found by 
Moore et al. (2000). 
Reconstructed tree densities on New Mexico subplots had no clear trend when related to 
those recorded on historical maps (Table 3.2: Modeled). Totals resulted in error rates that ranged 
from an underestimate of five trees (JEMS2A) to an overestimate of 222 trees (GILAS1A) per 
plot.  
Overestimation of tree size, together with death date and cut date uncertainties, may lead 
to overestimates of past tree density.  Our reconstruction techniques minimized cut date 
uncertainties based on historical ledger accounts, but still overestimated tree size and, therefore 
density. Possible refinements of the reconstructions process might include further error analysis 
associated with the decay functions and the backwards radial growth regression utilized. Further

investigation in these areas of the model may allow better accuracy in stand density 
reconstruction. 
 
Results and Discussions: Reconstruction of Presettlement Structures:  Information 
gained from analysis of size reconstruction of decomposed snags and dead and downed trees 
previously found by Moore et al. (2000) were used to parameterize the reconstruction live tree 
diameters at fire exclusion dates (AZ: 1876, NM: 1890). For plots, the model was set to move 
trees through decay classes at the appropriate percentile (AZ: 0.50, NM: 0.25), to cut post-plot 
establishment trees as outlined (Table 3.1), and to cut trees harvested before plot establishment in 
the year they were harvested (1891-1913). The resulting DBH estimates were not adjusted as 
previously done. Resulting Arizona plot presettlement densities ranged from 32 to 157 trees per 
plot (≈ TPH) in Arizona to 117 to 277 for New Mexico (Table 4.1).  Slightly lower presettlement 
densities have been reported, ranging from 56-60 TPH near Woolsey plots in northern Arizona 
(Covington and Moore 1994, Mast et al. 1999).  Increases in density from fire exclusion to the 
present ranged up to 29-fold, although plots COCS4A and COCS4B showed only slight increases 
(Figure 4.1; Table 4.1).  
Diameter distributions (all live trees > 1.4 m in height; ≥ 9.14 cm DBH) reveal that the 
largest increases have occurred in the smallest size classes over this approximate 120-year period.  
Figure 4.1 shows a comparison of diameters for trees reconstructed at fire exclusion and 
contemporary (1997-1999) dates. Tree recruitment since fire exclusion has shifted diameter 
distributions to negative exponential forms.  
 
Summary: 
 
Tree structural remains are important in forest reconstruction to determine fire history 
and structural characteristics of past stand conditions (Fulé et al. 1997, Mast et al. 1999); or to 
determine the effects of partial cutting on tree composition and stand growth (Deal and Tappeiner 
2002).  The precision of these analyses is highly dependent on field identification of 
presettlement evidence, dendrochronological proficiency, and relationships utilized in "reverse" 
growth and decay modeling.  While a potential source of error in stand reconstruction approaches 
is the failure to recognize the evidence of former tree structures or locations in the field (e.g., 
snags, stumps, down logs, stump hole, etc.), additional error can be linked to the imprecise 
reconstruction tree diameters to their former size.   
Overestimation of tree size, together with death date and cut date uncertainties, may lead 
to overestimates of past tree density.  Our reconstruction techniques minimized cut date 
uncertainties based on historical ledger accounts, but still overestimated tree size and tree density 
on the plots  Possible refinements of the reconstructions process might include further error 
analysis associated with the decay functions and the backwards radial growth regression utilized.

Objective 5:  Ecosystem changes from 1876 to 2002:  A case study of COCS1A 
 
By:  D. W. Huffman, J. D. Bakker, D. M. Bell, and M. M. Moore 
 
 
Background and Methods: 
Readers’ note:  In objectives 2-4 the analyses were restricted to a smaller subplot (1.01 
ha) of this larger one.  Objectives 5 and 6 analyze the entire plot area of COCS1A (2.59 ha) and 
the results therefore differ slightly from those reported in earlier objectives.   
Temporal and spatial modeling requires a tremendous amount of data and computing 
power.  If a mistake is made, it is difficult to find the error if many plots are analyzed 
simultaneously.  Therefore, we chose to examine a single plot for objectives 5 (ecosystem 
changes) and 6 (spatial pattern changes) so that we might work through all of the techniques and 
procedures and set up analytical routines on this prototype plot.  Temporal and spatial analyses 
will be extended to additional plots soon. 
The plot we chose for this case study was COCS1A (see Fig. 1.2 in General Methods).  
COCS1A is located on the Fort Valley Experimental Forest approximately 10 km NW of 
Flagstaff.  The overstory vegetation is ponderosa pine and the understory vegetation is 
predominantly perennial bunchgrasses.  The elevation is 2240 m.  The soils are Mollic 
Eutroboralfs and Typic Argiborolls, primarily with clay loam and stony clay textures. This plot is 
6.4 ac or 2.59 ha (160 x 160 m) in size.      
COCS1A was established in 1909 (the first plot established by Gus Pearson).  It was 
harvested prior to plot establishment in 1894 by Greenlaw Lumber Company.  In 1909 the entire 
plot had 134 residual trees (52 TPH). This plot was also thinned from below in 1941.  
 
Objective 5:  We examined how documented changes in overstory structure have affected 
ecosystem function such as overstory biomass accumulation, nutrient storage, understory biomass 
production, and fire behavior.  Forest structural and ecosystem changes were examined for the 
following points in time: 1) 1876 (fire exclusion date) using tree numbers and sizes obtained via 
the reconstruction techniques explained in Objective 4;  2) 1909-1949 in 5-year increments using 
tree numbers and sizes obtained from historical ledgers; and 3) 2002 (our remeasurement; based 
on 2001-2002 data).  All analyses were conducted on trees ≥ 9.14 cm DBH.  All production 
estimates have been converted to SI units for presentation and discussion.  Ledger data are stored 
in the Fort Valley Archives, USFS RMRS, Flagstaff, AZ. 
Additional methods and analyses for changes in overstory structure, overstory biomass, 
overstory nutrients, understory production, and fire behavior are described in the following 
paragraphs. 
 
Overstory Structure:  Data collection for basic overstory structure was described in the 
‘General Methods’ section.  Basic overstory variables calculated at each date listed above include 
stand density (TPH), basal area, quadratic mean diameter, and Reineke’s Stand Density Index 
(Avery and Burkhart 2002). 
 
The crown area of each tree was calculated using an allometric equation relating crown 
radius to tree diameter (Table 5.2).  The crown area of each tree was summed to yield a total 
crown area, and the total crown area was divided by the total plot area (25,900 m2) to yield the 
proportion of the plot occupied by crowns.  This method of calculating canopy cover yields a 
high estimate, as it does not account for crown overlap. 
The diameter and age (center date at 40 cm height) distributions of the plot at present 
were examined using all trees > 1.4 m tall (in comparison, all other analyses here focus on trees ≥ 
9.14 cm DBH).

Overstory Biomass:  We used allometric equations relating foliage, branch, bark, 
stemwood, and coarse root weight to tree diameter (Table 5.1) to estimate component biomass of 
trees.  
Changes in leaf area index (LAI; m2/m2) over time were estimated using equations that 
relate fascicle weight to tree diameter, and fascicle surface area to fascicle weight (Table 5.1).  
Number of fascicles per tree was estimated by dividing foliage weight per tree by weight per 
fascicle.  We calculated projected leaf surface area per tree by taking the product of the number of 
fascicles per tree and one-sided fascicle area surface area (Cable 1958).  LAI was estimated by 
summing fascicle surface area of all trees and dividing by the total plot area (25,900 m2). 
 
 
Overstory Nutrients:   We estimated nutrients (kg/ha) stored in trees using values for 
average nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) content of biomass components for 
ponderosa pine trees in southwestern Idaho (Clayton and Kennedy 1980). We found no other 
published studies providing a comprehensive analysis of component nutrient content.   However, 
values given by these authors for nitrogen content were similar to those reported for ponderosa 
pine tree components in northern Arizona (Klemmedson 1975) and foliage in the Great Basin 
(Poth and Fenn 1998).  Nutrient percentages used are given in Table 5.2.  
 
Understory Biomass:  Understory production (kg/ha) was estimated using allometric 
equations developed at Gus Pearson Natural Area (< 1 km from COCS1A), the Wild Bill Range, 
and the Beaver Creek Watershed (Table 5.3).  We used three equations to see if they are 
predicting similar trends in production over time.   
Forest floor depth (cm) was predicted using equations developed in fire-excluded forests 
at the Beaver Creek watershed and other sites throughout northern Arizona (Table 5.3). 
 
Fire behavior:  The Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) and the Fire and Fuels Extension 
(FFE-FVS) were used to examine temporal changes in forest structure and historical and 
contemporary fire behavior from 1876 to 2002.  The Southwestern Ponderosa Pine Model of the 
Central Rockies GENGYM Variant was designated as the most appropriate for ponderosa pine 
stands in Northern Arizona (Dixon 2001).  ‘Suppose’ Vers.1.16, a graphical interface for FVS, 
was used to import data and run stand simulations.  Changes in stand structure were considered 
based on stand density (TPH) and basal area (m2/ha) as determined above in “Overstory 
Structure”.  FFE-FVS was used to quantitatively analyze fire behavior using crowning index 
(km/h) as an indicator of potential for extreme fire behavior.  Crowning index depends on canopy 
bulk density (driven by tree growth and density), slope steepness (a static environmental 
condition), and surface fuel moisture (a product of local weather conditions) (Beukema et al. 
2003).   
 
Forest inventory data required formatting before it could be inputted into FVS.  Inventory 
data was modified using Format4FVS V1.1.  Minimum FVS data for individual trees included 
tree number, DBH, tree species, and tree status (dead or alive); tree height and crown ratio were

Historic weather data were located for the Flagstaff Remote Automated Weather Station 
(RAWS) for 1968-2003 (USDA 2004).  All analyses were based on June weather since June is 
historically the driest and most fire-prone month for much of northern Arizona.  Estimates of 50th 
and 97th percentile fire weather conditions based on RAWS data included diurnal high 
temperature, 20 foot wind speed, and fuel moistures for 1, 10, 100, and 1000 hour fuels; estimates 
were made using Fire Family Plus V3.04.  These weather conditions were taken as proxies for 
moderate and severe fire weather conditions, respectively.

Results: 
Overstory Structure:  Our reconstruction predicted that the stand density (trees ≥ 9.14 cm 
DBH) at fire exclusion (1876) was 110 TPH.  Harvesting in 1894 reduced the density by more 
than half; density at plot establishment (1909) was 51 TPH.   Between plot establishment and 
today, stand density increased more than 11-fold to 574 TPH in 2002 (Fig. 5.1a).  However, 86% 
of this increase had already occurred by 1949, when the density was 494 TPH. 
Basal area at fire exclusion was about 21 m2/ha.  Harvesting in 1894 removed about two-
thirds of this area so that the basal area at plot establishment was only 5.8 m2/ha.  Since then, 
basal area has increased 6-fold to 38.6 m2/ha today (Fig. 5.1b).  Basal area has continued to 
accumulate and is not leveling off as tree density did.  Basal area in 1949 was equal to that at fire 
exclusion and only 54% of that in 2002. 
Quadratic mean diameter (QMD) was highest (49.4 cm) at fire exclusion and then 
declined to a low of 22.4 cm in 1924 before slowly rising again (Fig. 5.2a and Fig. 5.3).  By 2002, 
QMD was 29.3 cm.  Reineke’s Stand Density Index was 319 at fire exclusion and 98 at plot 
establishment, and has since risen to 720 in 2002 (Fig. 5.2b).  Canopy cover declined from 30% 
at fire exclusion to 9% in 1909 and then rose to 59% today (Fig. 5.2c). 
Figure 5.3 also illustrates changes in diameter distributions for COCS1A from fire 
exclusion to 2002 using 5 cm diameter classes.  This figure includes a comparison of 1909 actual 
data and reconstructed data (as if the 1894 harvest had never happened on this plot).  TPH, basal 
area, QMD, and diameter distribution trends are similar to those seen in figures 5.1, 5.2, and 5.4. 
The 2000 diameter distribution was dominated by small trees (Fig. 5.4a); in addition to 
the 574 TPH ≥ 9.14 cm DBH there are another 177 TPH which are < 9.14 cm DBH.  The 2000 
age distribution is dominated by a regeneration pulse from the early 1900s; 42% of trees reached 
a height of 40 cm between 1900 and 1919 (Fig. 5.4b). 
NOTE:  The “dip” in the overstory structure variables and other variables that follow 
(biomass, nutrients, etc.) in 1944 is due to two major factors: 1) harvesting of some trees on this 
plot in 1941, and 2) not recording ingrowth in 1944 (all ingrowth after 1939 was recorded in 
1949). 
  
Overstory Biomass:  Total tree (≥ 9.14 cm DBH) biomass decreased from 169,924 kg/ha 
in 1876 to 33,431 kg/ha in 1909 (Fig. 5.5a). After 1909, total tree biomass showed a roughly 
linear increase until 2002 when it reached 202,465 kg/ha.  Thus, from date of fire exclusion and 
plot establishment to contemporary conditions, total tree biomass increased by 19 and 600%, 
respectively.  The proportion of biomass allocated aboveground has increased from 78% in 1876 
to 81% in 1909 and 82% in 2002. 
Leaf area index decreased from 1.9 m2/m2 in 1876 to 0.6 m2/m2 in 1909 (Fig. 5.5b).  
From plot establishment to 2002, LAI increased to 3.8 m2/m2.  
 
Overstory Nutrients: N stored aboveground in trees decreased from 608 kg/ha in 1876 to 
129 kg/ha in 1909 (Fig. 5.6a).  Foliage accounted for 12.5% (76 kg/ha) of the N in 1876 and 16% 
(21 kg/ha) of the N in 1909.  Aboveground P decreased from 15 kg/ha at fire exclusion to 4 kg/ha 
at plot establishment (Fig. 5.6b).  Potassium also decreased, from 125 kg/ha in 1876 to 28 kg/ha 
in 1909 (Fig. 5.6c). 
Since 1909, N has increased to 799 kg/ha in 2002, which represented an increase of more 
than 600% since plot establishment.  N levels in 2002 are 31% higher than those in 1876 (Fig. 
5.6a).  The foliage accounted for 17% (138 kg/ha) of the N in 2002.  Foliar N has increased 550% 
since plot establishment and 82% since fire exclusion.  P and K showed similar changes; 
aboveground storage in trees was 23 kg/ha and 176 kg/ha in 2002 for the two nutrients, 
respectively.  For P, this represented increases of 475% and 53% since plot establishment and fire 
exclusion dates, respectively.  For K, increases were 528% and 41% since plot establishment and 
fire exclusion, respectively (Fig. 5.6b and 5.6c).

Understory Biomass:  The equation developed at the Wild Bill Range has a different 
form than the other two at low basal areas (Fig. 5.7a).  The equation developed on the Beaver 
Creek watershed was based on average annual production values for each plot and is less affected 
by interannual climatic variation than the other two equations (Bojorquez-Tapia et al. 1990).  The 
prediction from this equation is very similar to the average of the three equations, on which we 
based our analyses (Table 5.3). 
Understory production more than doubled between 1876 and 1909, and this variable is 
predicted to be only 64 kg/ha (6.4 g/m2) at present.  This represents a reduction of 54% compared 
to the predicted production in 1876 and a reduction of 83% compared to the predicted production 
in 1909. 
The forest floor is predicted to have been about 2.5 cm in 1876 and to have declined to 
1.5 cm in 1909 (Fig. 5.7b).  Since plot establishment, the predicted forest floor depth has 
increased to 2.5 cm in 1949 and to 3.4 cm at present. 
 
 
Fire Behavior:  50th and 97th percentiles for June 1968-2003 fuel moisture, wind speed, 
and temperature for the Flagstaff Weather Station are found in Table 5.4.  Crowning indices for 
moderate (50th percentile) and severe (97th percentile) fire weather are shown in Fig. 5.8.  Under 
these conditions, crowning index rose between 1876 and 1909 and then declined rapidly until the 
1930’s, after which reductions occurred more slowly (Fig. 5.8).  Similar trends are evident for 
both moderate and severe fire weather, though crowning indices were always lower for severe 
than moderate fire weather.  
 
Discussion: 
Overstory Structure:  Stand density, basal area, and quadratic mean diameter decreased 
from fire exclusion (1876) to 1909 (Fig. 5.1, Fig. 5.2) due to the harvest that occurred in 1894.  
This harvest extracted over 50% of the trees and two-thirds of the basal area on this plot.  The 
reduction in QMD from fire exclusion to 1924 (Fig. 5.2a) also reflects the combined effects of 
tree harvest and ingrowth of ponderosa pine regeneration.  Since then, small trees have died due 
to self-thinning and the QMD has risen slightly.   
Much of the change in stand density had already occurred by 1950 (Fig. 5.1a).  Basal area 
has continued to increase in a linear fashion and is almost twice as large now as at fire exclusion, 
before any harvesting had occurred (38.6 vs. 21.0 m2/ha, respectively).  Similarly, canopy cover 
is more than twice as large now as at fire exclusion (Fig. 5.2c). 
The age distribution is dominated by trees that reached a height of 40 cm in the early 
1900s.  Several authors (e.g., Savage et al. 1996) have suggested that the 1919 regeneration pulse 
produced many of the trees that are present in today’s forests.  However, assuming that a tree 
takes at least 3 years to reach 40 cm height, more than half of the trees on COCS1A germinated 
prior to 1919 (i.e., have a center date < 1922). 
Moore et al. (2004) compared the historical (1909) and contemporary (1997) forest 
structure on a 1 ha subplot of this site.  On this subplot, stand density and basal area were lower at 
plot establishment (26 TPH, 3.0 m2/ha) than on the entire plot as reported here (51 TPH, 5.8 
m2/ha; Fig. 5.1).  Conversely, stand density and basal area in 1997 were higher on the subplot in 
1997 (703 TPH, 42.2 m2/ha) than on the entire plot in 2002 (574 TPH, 38.6 m2/ha).  These 
differences are due primarily to two factors.  First, the northwest corner of the site where the 
subplot is located is on a basalt outcrop at slightly higher elevation than the rest of the plot.  
Contemporary tree densities are more than 20% higher on the subplot than on the plot as a whole. 
Second, stand densities are declining due to continued tree mortality.  On the subplot, 13 
trees (1.8%) ≥ 9.14 cm DBH died between 1997 and 2002.  Eight trees grew to be ≥ 9.14 cm 
DBH during this period, so the net result was a reduction of five trees, from 703 TPH to 698 
TPH.  An additional 27 small trees died and no trees grew to be > 1.4 m tall, so the density of 
trees < 9.14 cm DBH declined from 239 TPH in 1997 to 204 TPH in 2002.

Overstory Biomass:   Tree biomass on COCS1A at fire exclusion date (169,924 kg/ha) 
reflected the relatively low density (110 TPH) yet high QMD (49.4 cm).  Larger trees contributed 
disproportionately to stand biomass, as reflected in the high wood-foliage biomass ratio (25.9). 
Tree biomass in aboveground components (131,813 kg/ha; exclusion of coarse root biomass) was 
approximately 60% greater than that estimated for 1876 by Covington et al. (2002) (81,500 
kg/ha) for a site near ours.  However, estimated tree density and biomass at fire exclusion was 
nearly twice as high on COCS1A: 110 vs. 60 TPH and 21 m2/ha vs. 10.6 m2/ha, respectively 
(Mast et al. 1999, Covington et al. 2001).  We are aware of no other studies that have estimated 
presettlement biomass for ponderosa pine forests. 
The removal of large trees during the 1894 harvest was reflected by a reduction in wood-
foliage biomass ratio (19.2) in 1909.  The wood-foliage biomass ratio declined to 15.1 in 1949 
and then rose to 17.6 in 2002 as a selective harvest in 1941, together with natural mortality, 
encouraged diameter growth of individual trees. 
Aboveground biomass increased from 1909 (27,097 kg/ha) to 2002 (165,461 kg/ha) with 
large pulses of tree establishment and stand growth.  By 2002, aboveground biomass was within 
28% of the value reported by Covington et al. (2001) for 1992 conditions on their site.  
Contemporary woody plant biomass in a northern Arizona ponderosa pine and Gambel oak 
(Quercus gambelii Nutt.) stand ranged from 405 kg/ha to 81,654 kg/ha as ponderosa pine basal 
area ranged from 0 m2/ha (forest opening) to 23 m2/ha (Clary 1978).  Klemmedson (1975) 
estimated biomass of a dense (22,500 TPH) ponderosa pine stand near COCS1A to be 189,870 
kg/ha.   
Changes in overstory biomass since fire exclusion represent alteration of forest structure 
from open stands dominated by large trees, to closed stands of smaller, younger trees.  This was 
clear in our examination of LAI dynamics.  Leaf area index doubled from 1.9 at fire exclusion to 
3.8 in 2002.  Thus, contemporary conditions reflect stands of smaller trees with a high proportion 
of foliage and leaf area as compared to large trees that have proportionally more stem wood 
(Cable 1958).  The increased proportion of nutrients stored in the foliage in 2002 compared to 
1876 (Fig. 5.6) further illustrates this change.  Maximum LAI for ponderosa pine stands appears 
to range from 4.2 to 9.0 m2/m2 and to be determined by site productivity (Grier and Running 
1977, Gholz 1982, McLeod and Running 1988). The changes we estimated may indicate stand 
conditions of decreasing tree growth efficiency.  For example, Oren et al. (1987) showed that tree 
growth efficiency (stem volume production per unit of foliage area) decreased exponentially in 
ponderosa pine trees as LAI increased from 0 to 4 m2/m2. Decreased growth efficiency may 
indicate limitations in tree storage reserves and production of chemical that may provide defense 
against pests and pathogens (Waring and Schlesinger 1985).          
 
Overstory Nutrients:  Our values of 609-799 kg/ha of aboveground N were 
approximately twice those reported for a dense stand of young ponderosa pine near COCS1A 
(Klemmedson 1975) but 2-3 times lower than those reported by Covington et al. (2001).  This 
difference may be due to an error in Covington et al. (2001) when they apparently used 11.1% for 
foliar N, when the value should have 1.0%.  Other than this discrepancy due to an error, 
differences between our estimates and those of other researchers are likely due to real differences 
in stand conditions as well as differences in values used in calculations.   
Changes from 1876 to 2002 in N storage (Fig. 5.6) suggest an increasing proportion of N 
stored in foliage as compared with N in wood.  However, as tree recruitment in COCS1A 
approaches zero, growth of existing trees and self-thinning of the stand will likely begin to reduce 
the proportion of aboveground N stored in tree foliage (Covington et al. 2001).  In general, 
changes in overstory nutrient storage suggest diminished nutrient turnover and decreased nutrient 
availability to other ecosystem components such as understory plants and non-arboreal herbivores 
(Covington and Moore 1994, Kaye and Hart 1998, Covington et al. 2001).

Understory Biomass:  Understory production is reduced at present compared to both fire 
exclusion and plot establishment.  However, the predicted values presented here must be regarded 
as rough estimates.  In particular, the equations predict understory production from basal area but 
do not account for the distribution of basal area in the stand.  This is illustrated by comparing the 
overstory structure in 1876 and 1949.  Basal area was equal at both times (Fig. 5.1b) but density 
was more than 4 times larger in 1949 (Fig. 5.1a), indicating that there were many small trees.  
Further analysis of this issue is required but beyond the scope of this report. 
The forest floor has increased in depth (Fig. 5.7b), suggesting that it is becoming an 
increasingly important pool of nutrients.  In fact, the forest floor was likely even shallower in 
presettlement times than reported here, as the allometric equations used to predict it (Table 5.3) 
were developed in fire-excluded forests.  The frequent fire regime during presettlement times 
would have consumed much of the forest floor, reducing the amount of forest floor present in 
1876 below the values calculated here. 
 
 
Fire Behavior:  The dramatic increase in crowning index (reduced likelihood of active 
crown fire) between 1876 and 1909 (Fig. 5.8) is most likely a result of the 1894 harvest.  
Crowning indices remained higher than in 1876 until 1924, indicating that the likelihood of active 
crown fire was also lower.  After this time, both extreme and moderate crowning indices begin to 
approach observable wind speeds for Northern Arizona.  The decreasing crowning index since 
1909 indicates rapid development of active crown fire conditions and the potential for movement 
of fire from stand to stand, a driving factor in medium to large fires (Atkins and Lundberg 2002).  
As slope and weather conditions were held constant during this analysis, increasing tree density 
(and hence crown bulk density) is the cause for increasing crown fire potential.   
It is important to note that the fire weather was derived from daily weather data for the 
month of June from 1968-2003 and then applied to inventory years from 1876, 1909-1949, and 
2002.  Reconstructions of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (AD 1700 to 1978) for the 
Southwestern United States indicate that summer season (June – August) weather was drier 
during the second half of the 20th century when compared to the first four decades of the century 
(Swetnam and Baisan 1996).  Though June weather may not follow the same trend, overall fire 
season weather would have been milder during the early-20th century.  Even though localized 
weather conditions may have varied from regional reconstructions, the drier conditions in the 
late-20th century may have contributed to lower than actual crowning index for the time period 
under consideration and thus exaggerated fire behavior. 
 
Summary: 
 
Overstory structure on COCS1A has changed significantly between 1876 and 2002.  A 
selective harvest in 1894 significantly reduced the stand density, total basal area, and quadratic 
mean diameter.  Since plot establishment in 1909, density and basal area have increased to levels 
greatly exceeding those found in 1876.  Canopy cover, overstory biomass, leaf area index, 
overstory nutrients, and forest floor depth are predicted to have increased as basal area increased.  
Levels of all of these variables in 2002 exceeded the predicted levels in 1876.  Understory 
production is predicted to have declined as basal area increased, and was lower in 2002 than at 
any other date. 
 
The dip in all variables in 1944 is due to two major factors: 1) harvesting of some trees 
on this plot in 1941, and 2) not recording ingrowth in 1944 (all ingrowth after 1939 was recorded 
in 1949). 
In 2002, the overstory was dominated by small trees (< 20 cm), many of which first grew 
to a height of 40 cm between 1900 and 1939. 
The crowning indices rose as a result of the 1894 harvest and then decreased over time.  
The potential to support an active crown fire has increased greatly, and is higher at present than in 
1876 or 1909.

The tree harvests of the late 19th and early 20th century, together with fire exclusion, 
overgrazing, and climate change, altered the trajectory of stand development of ponderosa pine in 
northern Arizona.  These factors must be taken into account in ponderosa pine restoration 
treatments.

Objective 6:  Spatial pattern changes from 1909 to 2002:   A Case study of COCS1A 
 
By:  M. M. Moore, A. J. Sánchez Meador, and J. D. Bakker 
 
Introduction: 
Few studies have examined the spatial patterns of ponderosa pine in northern Arizona.  
Pearson (1910) was the first to mention that ponderosa pine, particularly the regeneration, is not 
uniform, but rather occurs in groups.  Cooper (1960) attempted to quantify the spatial structure in 
ponderosa pine on the White Mountain Apache Reservation.  He used contiguous quadrats and 
found that the trees were aggregated into distinct groups that ranged from 0.06 to 0.14 ha (0.15 to 
0.35 ac), and that tree reproduction established in groups of about the same size in the 
interspaces.  Cooper (1961) used Clark and Evans’ R to examine tree aggregation and the effect 
of spacing on growth of individual pine trees.  He discussed four scales of patterns in ponderosa 
pine forests from the individual and small groups of trees to the stand-level patterns.  Cooper 
(1961) concluded that trees in younger stands (around 40 years) had a tendency to aggregate and 
that trees in older stands (around 80 years) had a tendency to be more regularly distributed.  
However, this result was mixed, and many of the results were not statistically significant.  White 
(1985) examined ponderosa pine presettlement tree patterns (live trees ≥ 106 yrs) in the Gus 
Pearson Natural Area, an unharvested stand <1 km from COCS1A.  He used Clark and Evans’ R 
to determine that stems of these older trees were strongly aggregated and that most occurred in 
groups of three or more trees (3 to 44 stems) occupying areas ranging from 0.02 to 0.29 ha.  The 
focus of White (1985) was to examine the even- or uneven-agedness of these older tree groups.  
Biondi et al. (1994) used variograms and kriged maps to examine the spatial structure of stem 
diameter (DBH), basal area, and basal area increment in the Gus Pearson Natural Area.  They 
found that stem size was spatially autocorrelated over distances up to 30 m, which they 
interpreted as a measure of average patch diameter.  They also concluded that because patch 
diameter remained constant though time, the observed increase in tree density was due to an 
increased number of patches, not to an areal increase of existing patches. 
We examined the spatial patterns of trees on one plot, COCS1A (Fig. 1.2, and Fig. 6.1; 
6.4 ac, 2.59 ha, 160 x 160 m) at plot establishment (1909 unharvested [reconstructed structure as 
it would have been if harvesting had not occurred in 1894]; Sánchez Meador unpublished data; 
and 1909 harvested [actual structure post-harvest]) and in contemporary times (2001-2002).  We 

 
 
 
 
42
refer to these three scenarios as ‘Reconstructed-Establishment’, Actual-Establishment’, and 
‘Actual-Contemporary’, respectively.  Forest structural conditions in Actual-Establishment in 
1909 and Actual-Contemporary in 2002 are described in Objective 5. 
 
Spatial Statistics Background and Analysis:    
Point pattern and surface pattern analyses were conducted on live trees ≥ 9.14 cm DBH.  
We describe each spatial statistic and analysis in the following paragraphs.  All analyses were 
conducted using the S+SpatialStats module (MathSoft 2000), a spatial analysis library (Reich and 
Davis 2003) developed for S-Plus (Version 6.1; Insightful Corporation 2002), and spatial 
correlation software developed by Richard Duncan (Duncan and Stewart 1991). 
Point pattern analyses explore the mapped positions of points (stems of live trees in our 
case) on a plane using “plot-less sampling” and determine whether the spatial distribution of the 
trees is random (also called complete spatial randomness or CSR), clumped (also called 
aggregated), or uniform (also called regular or over dispersed) (Upton and Fingleton 1985, 
Legendre 1993).  The point pattern techniques included in this report include two nearest-
neighbor distance (NND) indices (Clark and Evans’ R [Clark and Evans 1954] and Pielou’s Index 
[Pielou 1959, Pielou 1977]).  Values of Clark and Evans’ R < 1 indicate an aggregated 
distribution, values > 1 indicate a uniform distribution, and R = 1 indicates a random distribution.  
Pielou’s Index is interpreted as the inverse of Clark and Evans’ R (i.e., values < 1 indicate 
uniform distribution and values > 1 indicate an aggregated distribution).  These two measures 
also differ in that Clark and Evans’ R examines the distribution associated with distance from a 
random tree to its nearest neighbor, while Pielou’s Index examines the squared distance from a 
randomly generated point to the nearest tree.  We used 100 random points for 1909 data and 1000 
random points for 2002 data for Pielou’s Index.  Both NND indices were corrected for edge 
effects.  For each NND index, a z-test was used to determine whether the spatial distribution was 
significantly (α = 0.05) non-random. 
One of the major problems of NND indices is that they convey whether vegetation is 
clumped, uniform, or random, but they do not give any information on the size or spacing of the 
clumps involved in the pattern (Dale et al. 2002).  According to Pielou (1977), Clark and Evans R 
is related to the intensity of the pattern, while Pielou’s index is related not only to the intensity 
and but also to the grain.  Neither index provides information about scale. 
The third point pattern technique included in this study was Ripley’s K(t) statistic (Ripley 
1976, Ripley 1977).  This is a second-order statistic related to plant-to-all-plant techniques (Dale 
1999) based on distances between pairs of points (live trees) and the number of points within a 
certain radial distance (t) of each point. We reduced the error induced by edge effects in this 
analysis by using a maximum distance of 80 m (half of the minimum dimension of the plot; Boots 
and Getis 1988).  Visual interpretation is simplified using a variance stabilizing transformation of 
K(t) to L(t)-t.  The graphs of L(t) resemble a correlogram; values >0 indicate clumped and values 
<0 indicate uniform spatial distributions.  To test for significance of the L(t) observed values, a 
Monte Carlo approach was used where the observed results were compared with the frequency 
distribution from 100 random trials, therefore, the confidence limits are set at α = 0.01 (Upton and 
Fingleton 1985).  Ripley’s L(t) distribution is the cumulative frequency distribution of 
observations at each point-to-point distance; because it preserves distances, it can quantify 
intensity of pattern at multiple scales (Upton and Fingleton 1985, Dale 1999).   
As mentioned above, point pattern indices examine the distribution of points (trees) 
across space, but oftentimes we are interested in characterizing variation in a continuous variable 
(e.g., tree size, growth rates, heights) as a function of position in a geographic area.  Surface 
pattern analysis is a broad area of statistics that, in general, describes the spatial structure of a 
variable and tests for the presence of spatial dependence (autocorrelation; the tendency of a 
variable to be correlated with itself at finite distances) (Rossi et al. 1992, Legendre and Legendre 
1998).  We used the univariate structure functions of autocorrelation (as a correlogram) and 

 
 
 
 
43
semivariance (as a variogram) to quantify the spatial dependence of individual tree basal area 
(cross-sectional area of the stem at breast height; m2) on COCS1A.  A 1 m lag distance (the 
geographic distance between two samples) and an 80 m maximum lag distance (half of the 
smallest plot dimension) was used in all statistical tests described below.  For more information 
on the conceptual and mathematical relationships between these spatial analysis methods, the 
reader is referred to Legendre (1993), Dale (1999), and Dale et al. (2002). 
Spatial autocorrelation in a variable is basically derived and behaves in the same way as 
the familiar correlation coefficient, whereby some index of covariance is computed for a series of 
lag distances.  We used Moran’s I (Moran 1950, Legendre and Legendre 1998) as the index of 
covariance in this study.  A correlogram is a plot of the correlation coefficient (Moran’s I) against 
lag distance; I ranges from +1 (perfect positive spatial correlation) to -1 (perfect negative spatial 
correlation); 0 indicates no spatial correlation. Each correlogram was tested for global 
significance; individual autocorrelation statistics (α = 0.05, Bonferroni corrected to account for 
number of distance classes) were tested only if the global test was significant (Legendre and 
Legendre 1998). 
Semivariance examines the spatial variability of an observed variable at each lag 
distance.  The term semivariance means “half of the variance” and is half of the averaged squared 
difference of all pairs of points separated by a given distance (Rossi et al. 1992).  A variogram is 
a plot of semivariance against lag distance.  There is no formal test of significance for a 
variogram; it simply describes the spatial structure of the data.  The key points of interest are the 
range (the lag distance at which the asymptotic value of the variogram is reached), sill (the 
semivariance associated with the asymptotic value of the variogram), and nugget (the 
semivariance when the lag distance is 0). 
We used kriging to further aid in data interpretation.  Kriging uses the variogram to 
interpolate or predict the variable of interest at points not measured originally.  We set the pixel 
size to 5x5 m for all kriged maps.  In these maps, individual tree basal area is interpolated across 
the site and shading is used to indicate areas where individual trees have high basal area or low 
basal area.  Contours are drawn to delineate areas with uniform individual tree basal areas, and 
thus, closer contours contain the greatest variation in individual tree basal area. 
 
Results:   
Both nearest-neighbor indices indicate that live trees ≥ 9.14 cm DBH were clumped 
(aggregated) on COCS1A at plot establishment in 1909 (both reconstructed and actual) as well as 
in 2002.  Clark and Evans’ R showed a stronger tendency of trees to clump (R = 0.58; p = 0.0) 
and a smaller average distance to the nearest neighbor (4.1 m) in 1909-actual as compared to 
1909-reconstructed (R = 0.82; p = 0.0; distance to nearest neighbor = 4.5 m).  Contemporary 
patterns (2002) also exhibited clumpiness, but the tendency for trees to aggregate was not as 
strong (R = 0.91; p = 0.0) and the average distance to the nearest neighbor was much smaller (1.9 
m) than in 1909. 
Pielou’s Index also indicates that the spatial arrangement of trees was significantly 
clumped (p = 0.0) under all three scenarios.  Trees were more clumped in plot establishment 
1909-actual than in plot establishment-reconstructed (Pielou’s Index = 2.73 and 2.18, 
respectively).  Contemporary patterns (2002) were still clumped but the strength of the 
aggregation was diminished (Pielou’s Index = 1.51) compared to both 1909 scenarios. 
Ripley’s K indicated that although spatial patterns were present in all three scenarios, the 
trends differed.  In both 1909 scenarios, there was a distinct peak in aggregation of trees from 7.0 
to 8.5 m (Fig. 6.2a, 6.2b).  This peak indicated that clumps of trees were approximately 0.02 ha in 
size; the fact that the lag distance of the peak changed little indicates that the size of these clumps 
was minimally affected by the harvest.  However, the height of this peak was much larger for plot 
establishment-actual than for reconstructed, suggesting that the 1894 harvest increased the 
aggregation of the residual trees.  In 1909-reconstructed, trees were aggregated to about 34 m and 

 
 
 
 
44
uniformly distributed beyond about 53 m (Fig. 6.2a).  Clumps of trees were more than 80 m apart 
(i.e., there were no additional significant positive L(t) values out to the maximum distance tested).  
In 1909-actual, however, trees were clumped at all spatial scales up to the maximum distance 
tested (Fig. 6.2b), indicating that harvesting increased the clumpiness of trees.  In 2002, the trees 
remain clumped at all spatial scales up to the maximum distance tested (Fig. 6.2c), although the 
distinct small (0.02 ha) clumps from 1909 are no longer apparent. 
Global tests of Moran’s I indicated that trees were spatially autocorrelated on the basis of 
individual tree basal area in all three scenarios (p = 0.026, 0.011, and 0.000 for reconstructed-
1909, actual-1909, and actual-2002, respectively), meaning that smaller trees are more likely to 
be near one another and larger trees are more likely to be near one another than expected by 
chance alone.  Bonferroni corrected individual autocorrelation statistics, however, were 
significant only at the fine scale (up to 15 m) in reconstructed-1909 scenario, and only at 5 m in 
the actual-1909, but were significant in contemporary-2002 across most lags until 80 m (Fig. 6.3).  
In 2002, spatial autocorrelation (clumps of similar sized trees) extended to about 17 m and then 
dropped to 0, suggesting that there was no spatial structure between tree basal area and distance 
after that point (Fig. 6.3c). 
Variogram results and parameter estimates (range, sill, nugget) for individual tree basal 
area (m2) on COCS1A for 1909 (reconstructed and actual) and 2002 are shown in Figure 6.4.  
Trees were spatially autocorrelated up to 27.9 m in reconstructed-1909, and up to 34.4 and 34.7 
m, respectively in actual-1909 and actual-2002.  The high partial sill in 1909-reconstructed 
reflects the much higher variation in this data set (Fig.6.4a) than in actual-1909 (Fig. 6.4b) or 
2002 (Fig. 6.4c). The nugget (unresolved variation at very fine scales) was similar for all three 
scenarios. 
Kriged maps illustrated the spatial pattern of individual tree basal area across the plot 
(Fig. 6.5).  Lighter shading indicates areas with larger trees and closer contours indicated areas 
with greater variation in individual tree basal area.  Individual tree basal area was much more 
variable in reconstructed-1909 (Fig. 6.5a) than in actual-1909 (Fig. 6.5b), indicating that the 1894 
harvest reduced the variation in basal area.  In 2002, values ranged from very low individual tree 
basal area (small trees; darker shading) to larger individual tree basal areas (larger trees; lighter 
shading) (Fig. 6.5c).  The areas of largest individual tree basal area differ between all three 
scenarios.  The total basal area on the site cannot be calculated directly from these maps as it is a 
function of both the individual tree basal area and the number of trees per hectare. 
 
Discussion:  
Our results quantify the notion that ponderosa pine stands of northern Arizona have 
become more spatially homogeneous since the early 1900s.  The differences between the 
historical and contemporary data sets are pronounced.  Historically, this site exhibited dense 
clumps of trees averaging 0.02 ha in size alternating with sparsely populated zones or interspaces 
between clumps (Fig. 6.2a,b).  In contrast, the pattern in 2002 was characterized by clumps that 
span large areas (Fig. 6.2c).  Tree density has greatly increased over the last 90+ years (Objective 
5; Moore et al. 2004) and it is thought that the majority of tree recruitment has occurred in the 
shade of existing trees (Pearson 1910) and in the interspaces (available growing space) between 
existing clumps.  Pielou (1977) suggests that this is also a shift from high-intensity, fine-grained 
pattern to one of low-intensity and coarse-grained pattern. 
The partial harvest in 1894 homogenized the plot with respect to tree size by removing 
many of the largest diameter trees and changing the amount and distribution of tree sizes across 
the plot.  However, the spatial effects of the partial harvest in 1894 varied with the scale of 
consideration.  At fine scales, the size of clumps was largely unaffected (Fig. 6.2a, 6.2b).  At 
coarser scales, the clumpiness of the residual trees was increased because the harvest removed all 
of the trees in large patches (e.g., north-central, central, and southwest areas of Fig. 6.1b).  This is

also reflected by Clark and Evans’ R, which resulted in higher aggregation for 1909-actual than 
1909-reconstructed (R = 0.58 and 0.82, respectively). 
Individual autocorrelation statistics were significant at small lag distances, which suggest 
a positive spatial relationship and a greater chance of trees of similar sizes occurring together at 
fine-scales in both reconstructed-1909 and actual-1909 (Fig. 6.3a,b).  This spatial relationship of 
tree size and small lag distances held true up to 15 m and 5 m for the reconstructed-1909 and 
actual-1909 scenarios, respectively.  This result suggests that the late 1800s harvest on this plot 
changed the spatial pattern by grouping similar sized trees into smaller groups (from 0-15 m pre-
harvest to 0-5 m post-harvest). The correlogram was also significant in contemporary-2002 up to 
25-30 m, increasing the patch or clump size of trees since the early 1900s.  Undoubtedly, the 
doubling or tripling of patch size over the last 90+ years is due to the large recruitment of trees 
during this time period (Biondi 1996, Savage et al. 1996).   
The semivariogram showed a similar pattern, increasing variance with increasing 
distance out to 28-35 m (Fig. 6.4), indicating that there is a spatial pattern associated with tree 
size.  The range changed remarkably little between 1909 and 2002, however, particularly in light 
of the 10-fold increase in tree density (Objective 5). 
Spatial pattern results from this study on COCS1A are similar to the studies cited in the 
Introduction above.  For example, the range changed relatively little between 1909 and 2002 (Fig. 
6.4) and the magnitude of aggregation has declined (Clark and Evans’ R).  However, we found 
that trees were aggregated prior to harvest and that harvesting amplified the clumpy nature of 
ponderosa pine.  This aggregation has continued to contemporary times (2002) but the 
aggregation is due to several factors including the late 1800s tree harvest selection patterns and 
the establishment patterns of the large pine regeneration pulses during the 1900s.   
 
Summary:   
The spatial pattern differences between the historical (reconstructed-1909 and actual-
1909) and contemporary (2002) data sets on COCS1A are pronounced.  Historically, this site 
exhibited dense clumps of trees averaging 0.02 ha in size alternating with sparsely populated 
zones or interspaces between clumps.  In contrast, the pattern in 2002 was characterized by 
clumps that span large areas with few interspaces.  The partial harvest in 1894 homogenized the 
plot with respect to tree size by removing many of the largest diameter trees and changing the 
amount and distribution of tree sizes across the plot.  However, the spatial effects of the partial 
harvest in 1894 varied with the scale of consideration.  At fine scales, the size of clumps was 
largely unaffected by harvesting; a coarser scales, the clumpy nature of the residual trees was 
increased because the harvest removed all of the trees in large patches.

Figure 6.1.  COCS1A (6.4 ac, 2.59 ha, 160 x 160 m) with original stem maps for trees ≥ 9.14 cm 
DBH of:  (a) reconstructed-1909 (as if it had not been harvested), n = 220; (b) actual-1909 (as it 
existed post-harvest), n = 134; (c) contemporary-2002, n = 1,487. Points represent individual tree 
locations (point size is proportional to stem diameter and is on a different scale from tree 
coordinates for visual clarity).  The northern half of the plot is uphill with occasional exposed 
basalt outcrops, while the lower-half is downhill, with finer textured soils. 
 
Figure 6.2.  COCS1A - Ripley’s K statistic (transformed as [L(t)-t]) as a function of lag distance 
for: (a) reconstructed-1909, n = 220; (b) actual-1909, n = 134; (c) contemporary-2002, n = 1,487. 
The horizontal dashed line is the expected line under CSR (random) and the dashed lines on 
either side of it are the upper and lower confidence limits (α = 0.01) from 100 simulations of 
CSR.  Calculated values that fall outside of the confidence interval are statistically significant; 
values > 0 indicate aggregation and values <0 indicate uniform (regular) spatial distribution. 
 
Figure 6.3.  COCS1A – Correlograms of Moran’s I against lag distance for:  (a) reconstructed-
1909, n = 220; (b) actual-1909, n = 134; (c) contemporary-2002, n = 1,487.  The variable 
analyzed was individual tree basal area (m2; trees ≥ 9.14 cm DBH).  Values may range from +1 
(perfect positive spatial correlation) to -1 (perfect negative spatial correlation); 0 indicates no 
spatial correlation. Triangles indicate lag distances with significant autocorrelation (α = 0.05, 
Bonferroni corrected). 
 
Figure 6.4.  COCS1A – Variograms of individual tree basal area (m2) against lag distance for: (a) 
reconstructed-1909, n = 220; (b) actual-1909, n = 134; (c) contemporary-2002, n = 1,487 Note 
that the ‘sill’ reported here is a partial sill (difference between the semivariance of the nugget and 
of the asymptote); the ‘true’ sill is the sum of the nugget and the partial sill. 
 
Figure 6.5.  COCS1A – Kriged maps of individual tree basal area (m2) on 5x5 m blocks for: (a) 
reconstructed-1909, n = 220; (b) actual-1909, n = 134; (c) contemporary-2002, n = 1,487. Points 
represent individual tree locations (point size is proportional to stem diameter and is on a 
different scale from tree coordinates for visual clarity).  Kriged maps use semivariogram data 
from Figure 6.4 and display the concentration of individual tree basal area across the plot.  
Lighter “shades of gray” indicate areas with larger trees and closer contours indicate areas with 
greater variation in individual tree basal area.  For reference, a tree of 0.06 m2 basal area is 28 cm 
DBH, one of 0.32 m2 basal area is 64 cm DBH, and one of 0.64 m2 basal area is 90 cm DBH.
