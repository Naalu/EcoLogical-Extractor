A 4-Year Look: Lessons Learned
from the Southwest Regions’ Five
Collaborative Forest Landscape
Restoration (CFLR) Projects 
Stakeholders and Forest Service personnel from the
Uncompahgre Plateau, Colorado Front Range,
Southwest Jemez Mountains, Zuni Mountain Project,
and Four Forest Restoration Initiative CFLR sites
convened in the fall of 2013 for three days of cross-
project learning, field trips and discussions on the
challenges and solutions to restoring forests at the
landscape scale. The meeting was hosted by the
Uncompahgre Plateau collaborators, who also shared
one of the most interesting stories of collaboration.
Their partnership hasn’t had any appeals or litigation
on collaboratively developed projects. They attribute
this to three factors: A strong relationship between the
stakeholders and the Forest Service, their
collaboratively developed “Restoration Principles”
and, finally, lots of time together in the field.
 
At the conclusion of the meeting, the participants
developed recommendations that would improve

Greater USFS regional office
involvement: Increased communication and
engagement is needed between the projects
and the regional offices.
Improve monitoring and adaptive
management policies: The Forest Service
should standardize land management guidance
on adaptive NEPA, multi-party monitoring, and
data management. Legal and procedural
guidelines should be created that outline how
stakeholders and land managers can revise
desired conditions within a signed NEPA
decision, based on monitoring results and
adaptive management.
Support private industry to carry out
restoration: Private industry remains essential
to carrying out publically funded projects that
are reducing fire risk for communities across the
arid Southwest and lowering the cost of
suppressing wildfires.  However, the timelines,
locations and appropriations for planning
restoration treatments on national forests are
often out of synch with those required by private
sector industry to effectively complete
restoration treatments. To solve this problem
the USFS could use the CFLR collaborative
framework to directly incorporate industry needs
into the project planning process.
Reduce budgetary “borrowing”
problems: Currently CFLR projects are partially
funded by redirecting dollars from other forests
and forest management activities, contrary to
the CFLR’s original intent to be in addition
to base budgets. This has led to shortfalls and
problematic “borrowing” from other forest
management activities in order to accomplish
CFLR management objectives. Adequate

Wildlife research biologists present findings from a
study that examines effects of restoration treatments
on summer habitat-use patterns of female mule deer.
Researchers found that maintaining a surface fire
regime stimulates herbaceous understory vegetation,
providing an important dietary component for mule
deer.

Ecologists sampled 48 soil profiles in three vegetation
types at eight sites in northern Arizona ponderosa
pine forests to help inform thinning prescriptions.
Results suggest that soil development patterns should
be considered when choosing which trees to leave on
the landscape during thinning operations.

These wildlife ecologists examined the effects of

ERI Research
The upcoming field season promises to be a full one
for ERI staff and summer field technicians. Several
new projects will be initiated to examine ecosystem
responses to restoration and hazardous fuels
reduction treatments.
This summer the ERI will be establishing a new long-
term study of restoration of mixed conifer forests near
the Mogollon Rim on the Coconino National Forest.
This work will be part of the ERI’s Long-term
Ecological Assessment and Restoration Network
(LEARN), and used to broadly assist restoration
planning for this important and diverse ecosystem.
Complementing this study, the ERI will support the
graduate research of Kyle Rodman, who will
reconstruct the spatial patterns of mixed conifer trees
and tree groups that existed prior to historical
exclusion of frequent surface fire.
On the Kaibab National Forest, the ERI will begin
monitoring long-term effects of restoration on
hydrological and other ecosystem responses in a
collaborative project with Salt River Project. This
research will provide new watershed level information
and can be used to track outcomes of the Four Forest
Restoration Initiative (4FRI) project. In another
collaboration, the ERI will begin monitoring changes in
mixed conifer forest structure and potential fire
behavior on sites treated as part of the Flagstaff
Watershed Protection Project (FWPP). Data from this
study, along with responses of Mexican spotted owl
populations recorded by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, will be used to inform adaptive management
of spotted owl Protected Activity Centers (PACs).
Lastly, understory plant community conditions will be
recorded at a pinyon-juniper woodland study site,

where restoration treatments were done 10 years ago.
 
Restoration treatment
alternatives will be studied in
overly dense mixed conifer
forests.
Agency Outreach
The mild winter weather of 2013-2014 enabled ERI’s
Outreach group to continue data collection and
analysis on several key U.S. Forest Service projects
in the Southwestern Region. The group also
participated in various CFLRPs and provided science
support to restoration implementation efforts.  A few
highlights include:
Pineleno Ecosystem Restoration Project — Safford
Ranger District (RD), Coronado NF:  Design and
layout of a Restoration Demonstration Area that will
be harvested in 2015 and feature an interpretive trail
system through a mixed conifer vegetative ecosystem
that has active Red squirrel middens and a unique
management and fire history.
Mixed conifer LEARN study plots — Mogollon Rim
RD, Coconino NF: Together with ERI’s research and
development group, initiated identification of potential
long-term study sites that will provide information
about treatment alternatives in Mexican spotted owl
(MSO) habitat located in mixed conifer ecosystems.

Prescott NF MSO Habitat Treatment Study —
Bradshaw RD, Prescott NF: Initiated studies to
determine historical reference conditions in MSO
PACs and CORE areas, focusing on treatment
alternatives and the role of fire in these areas.
“Bridge the Gap” Restoration Projects Monitoring
Plan – Apache-Sitgreaves NF: Participation in
developing a forest-wide Monitoring Plan for multiple
restoration projects. This Monitoring Plan will guide
the monitoring and adaptive management efforts on
20,000 acres annually for the Bridge Projects within
the second 4FRI analysis area, until the 4FRI NEPA
process is completed and resultant strategies are
implemented.
Arizona Prescribed Fire Council: ERI assisted
several other partners in Arizona to establish a council
to help provide education and implementation of
prescribed fire in Arizona. For more info visit

The W.A. Franke College of Business (FCB) at
Northern Arizona University is on the cutting edge of
business schools in Arizona. It is also home to the
Arizona Rural Policy Institute (RPI), which is one of
four units of the Alliance Bank Business Outreach
Center, authorized and funded in part by the U.S.
Department of Commerce Economic Development
Administration. RPI leverages the vast capabilities of
NAU staff, students, facilities, research entities, and
other resources to publish research outcomes in
policy reports, surveys, and economic impact studies
and provides technical assistance to communities for
policy implementation.
 
The ERI has partnered with the Arizona Rural Policy
Institute and the W.A. Franke College of Business on
several research projects examining the local and
regional economic impacts of U.S. Forest Service
stewardship contracting as well as the full cost
accounting of catastrophic wildfires. Recent white
papers that resulted from this work include “A Full
Cost Accounting of the 2010 Schultz Fire” and
“Workforce Needs of the Four Forest Restoration
Initiative Project: An Analysis.” RPI is also currently
working on a cost avoidance study with ERI and other
stakeholders for the Flagstaff Watershed Protection
Project, which was put in place by a recent bond issue
approved by the citizens of Flagstaff.
