Abstract.
Awareness of the environmental footprint of building construction and use has led to increasing
interest in green building. Defining a green building is an evolving process with life cycle inventory and life
cycle impact assessment (LCIA) emerging as key tools in that evolution and definition process. This study
used LCIA to determine the environmental footprint associated with manufacturing 38-  138-mm redwood
(Sequoia sempervirens) decking from sustainably managed northern California redwood forests. Primary
survey data were collected from four redwood mills that represent 90% of redwood lumber production. The
primary data were then weight-averaged on a per-unit basis of 1 m3 of planed redwood decking (380 oven-
dry kg/m3) to calculate material flows and energy use. All of the raw material consumption and environ-
mental outputs were assigned to dry planed redwood decking and none to coproducts. The gate-to-gate,
cumulative energy consumption associated with manufacturing 1 m3 of planed redwood decking from
1.8 m3 of incoming logs was 1.36 GJ/m3 with 19% of the energy provided by burning wood residues.
Emission data produced through modeling the production process found that the estimated biomass and
fossil CO2 emissions were 20.9 and 52.9 kg/m3, respectively. Based on the carbon content of redwood of
53%, a cubic meter of 38-  138-mm redwood decking product stores 201 kg of carbon and if released

into the atmosphere would emit 738 kg of CO2. The amount of carbon stored in redwood decking is
equivalent to about 10 times the total CO2 emissions released during the manufacturing process.
Low carbon emissions during the manufacturing process and carbon storage during the service life of
a redwood deck are positive environmental attributes that should be considered when selecting a
decking product.

INTRODUCTION
Buildings consume approximately 41% of all
energy used in the US (USDOE 2012). Although
much of that energy is used during building occu-
pation, there is increased interest in decreasing
the embodied energy, the amount of energy used
in the production of a building material, as part
of the overall goal of decreasing the environ-
mental footprint of a building. Green construc-
tion practices have evolved substantially during
the past 30 yr in an effort to decrease energy
consumption, improve overall building perfor-
mance, and move toward more sustainable prac-
tices. In practice, green building started as a
series of prescriptions that experts thought were
the most critical to move construction toward
sustainability goals. Green building has now
expanded to include life cycle analysis that pro-
vides insight on how to improve energy and
material efficiency throughout the material pro-
duction and building construction and operation
while lowering overall environmental burdens
throughout the building’s entire life cycle.
Identifying building materials that possess posi-
tive environmental attributes is one result of the
increased interest in green building practices.
These practices may include using building mate-
rials with lower environmental impacts as well
as reusing or reducing the use of building mate-
rials capable of performing the same function.
The green building market for new nonresidential
construction in 2013 was originally expected to
triple to about $96-140 billion from $42 billion
in 2008 (MHC 2010). However, a newer fore-
cast made by McGraw Hill Construction (MHC
2012) indicates that the green building market in
2013 is expected to be $98-106 billion, on the
low end of the original forecast made in 2008.
This was most likely the result of the slow US
economic recovery during this time. Despite the
soft US economy, the percentage of new US res-
idential and nonresidential construction being
built green is forecasted to make up 45% of the
market by the end of 2016 (MHC 2012). In addi-
tion, building codes and standards such as the
International Green Construction Code (IgCC)
are implementing performance-based decision-
making based on scientific approaches including
life cycle analysis (Bowyer et al 2012).
There are a number of green building certifica-
tion systems in the US with the most well known
being LEED, ICC-700 National Green Building
Standard, Green Globes, IgCC, CA Green Con-
struction Code (CalGreen), and ASHRAE 189.1
(Ritter et al 2011). These green building certifi-
cation systems are based on a variety of param-
eters, and in recent years, there has been
increasing interest in using life cycle inventory
(LCI) and life cycle assessment (LCA) data as
an objective scientific basis for quantifying the
relative environmental benefit, or “greenness,”
of projects built using these certification systems.
This trend represents a shift away from prescrip-
tive-based toward performance-based certifica-
tion systems. In anticipation of the adoption of
such policies and their market implications, a
number of industries have initiated efforts to
develop LCI data for their products (Puettmann
and Wilson 2005; Puettmann et al 2010a; FAL
2010, 2011). Whole building LCA tools, such as
the ATHENA Impact Estimator for Buildings,
are becoming a necessary part of determining
a building’s environmental impact and are
increasingly becoming part of green building
certification systems (ASMI 2014). Developing
metrics to measure sustainability are part of the
green building process.

LCA can be used to provide a measure of building
sustainability. As part of an LCA, LCI measures
the inputs and outputs of the energy, material,
and waste associated with a product within a
specified system boundary. LCI that measure
from resource extraction through manufactur-
ing, use, and disposal are called cradle-to-grave
LCI. If only a subset of these steps is evaluated,
the LCI may be called a cradle-to-gate, gate-to-
gate, or gate-to-grave analysis. The goal of this
study was to document a gate-to-gate LCA of
redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) decking lumber
from incoming logs to dry planed redwood deck-
ing in northern California. A companion study
(Han et al 2014) examined the life cycle of
upstream processes from the seedling through
to harvest of redwood logs. In the companion
study, Han et al (2014) discuss the sustainable
forest harvesting practices conducted by the red-
wood industry by adhering to forest certification
standards and to the California Forest Practice
Rules, one of the most stringent forest harvest-
ing regulations in the US. Sustainable harvesting
is critical because it highlights the climate change
mitigation value of long-lived wood products
through their carbon storage capacity.
The LCA tracked all steps in the production of
redwood decking from the logs in the log yard
through the manufacturing process including
sawing, drying, and planing. We evaluated the
material flow, energy consumption, and emissions
for the redwood decking manufacturing process
on a per-unit basis (ie functional unit) of 1 m3.
Primary data were collected by visiting the major
redwood sawmills and administering a ques-
tionnaire. Peer-reviewed literature provided sec-
ondary data per Consortium for Research on
Renewable Industrial Material (CORRIM) guide-
lines (CORRIM 2010). Wood mass balances
were constructed with a spreadsheet algorithm
using data from primary and secondary sources.
From material and energy inputs and reported
emissions, SimaPro 7 software (PRe´ Consultants,
Amersfoort, The Netherlands) was used to model
the estimates for raw material consumption and
environmental outputs on a per-functional-unit
basis (PRe´ Consultants 2014). The study used the
US LCI database for secondary LCI data inputs
such as fuels and electricity (NREL 2014).
This study includes life cycle impact assessment
(LCIA) impact categories of global warming
potential (GWP) (kg CO2-eq), acidification
potential (AP) (kg SO2-eq), respiratory effects
(RE) (PM 2.5-eq), eutrophication potential (EP)
(kg N-eq), ozone depletion potential (ODP) (kg
CFC-11-eq), and smog potential (SP) (kg O3-eq)
(Bare 2011). Other impact measures included
the cumulative (total) energy demand (primary
energy) (MJ-eq), including both the biomass and
fossil fuel contributions, which were calculated
and reported directly from LCI flows. We also
tracked fresh water consumption (in liters) and
renewable and nonrenewable material resource
consumption (nonfuel resources). Impact cate-
gories and other impact measures were reported
per cubic meter of production.
Redwood
decking
is
the
primary
product
manufactured from redwood logs although fenc-
ing, siding, sashes, doors, blinds, and millwork
are also made (Wiemann 2010). According to
Binam (2013), 12 redwood mills produced
614,000 m3 of redwood lumber in 2010, which
was about a 20% increase from 2009 (USDOC
2011; Binam 2013, 2014). Redwood decking pro-
duction has declined substantially during the past
several decades, with annual production volumes
in 2012, 2001, 1994, and 1968 of 0.637, 1.33,
1.91, and 2.29 Mm3, respectively (Barrette et al
1970; USDOC 1995, 2006, 2011; Binam 2013,
2014). However, for 2009-2010, much of the
increase in redwood decking production has
been attributed to the increase in new residential
single-family construction. Units of single-family
residential construction on a seasonally adjusted
annual rate increased about 20% from 358,000 in
January 2009 to 429,000 in December 2010
(USDOC 2014). Redwood decking is used in
both new residential construction and repair and
remodeling of existing residential buildings.
Regardless of the current housing market, which
is expected to fully recover this year, increasing
environmental concerns regarding the building
industry will continue to define “green building”
materials and practices.

METHODOLOGY
Scope
This study covered the processing of redwood
logs arriving at the sawmill gate into redwood
decking leaving the sawmill (ie gate to gate),
following ISO (2006a, 2006b). LCA data from
this stage of the redwood decking production
process were used to facilitate a comparative
LCA between redwood decking and other non-
wood decking materials (Bergman et al 2013)
and to develop a business-to-consumer environ-
mental
product
declaration
(an
LCA-based
ecolabel) (AWC 2014). To construct the full
LCA, this LCA manufacturing stage was linked
to the forest resource (Han et al 2014) through
log transportation (upstream) and product trans-
portation (downstream). Figure 1 shows the pro-
cess flow for the gate-to-gate manufacturing of
redwood decking. This LCA manufacturing stage
provided a gate-to-gate analysis of the cumula-
tive energy of manufacturing including resource
(ie log) transportation.
In 2011, four redwood mills, representing 90%
of redwood lumber production, were visited.
The surveyed mills provided detailed annual
production data for 2010 for their production
facilities, including on-site energy consumption,
electrical usage, log volumes, and decking pro-
duction. The survey instrument administered at
the redwood sawmills can be found in the
Appendix of Bergman et al (2013).
Functional Unit

the unit processes to include in the LCA and

helped standardize the material flows, energy
use, and emission data. This study selected a
functional unit of 1 m3 of decking material
38 mm thick and no spacing between deck
boards. One cubic meter of dry redwood decking
equates to 26.3 m2 at 38 mm thick. Results were
reported per cubic meter of planed redwood
decking. Based on US industry measurements,
the following conversions were used for green
and dry wood decking: 2.36 and 1.62 m3 per
thousand board feet (bf), respectively. The differ-
ent conversions were used because wood shrinks
as it dries from its green state to its final dry state
and is then planed (Bergman 2010).
System Boundary
Selection of the system boundary helps track the
material and energy flows crossing the boundary
precisely. To track flows tied to redwood decking
production, two system boundaries were consid-
ered. One—the cumulative system boundary—is
represented by the solid line shown in Fig 2 and
includes both on- and off-site emissions from
the materials and energy consumed within
the redwood decking manufacturing process.
Energy and material resources used for the gen-
eration and production of transportation and
boiler fuels and grid electricity were included
within the cumulative system boundary and were
considered off-site. Off-site emissions include
emissions released during the production of grid
electricity, during the transportation of logs to
the mill, and during the production of the fuels
consumed on-site for process energy and trans-
portation. The on-site system boundary (repre-
sented by the dotted line shown in Fig 2)
covered emissions occurring only at the mill
from the four unit processes involved: log yard,
sawing, drying, and planing. Energy consump-
tion associated with log transportation was
included as a separate upstream process. Ancil-
lary material data such as lumber packaging,
motor oil, paint, and hydraulic fluid were col-
lected and were part of the analysis.
Data Quality
To ensure high-quality data, the original goal of
this study was to survey a minimum of 50% of
the redwood production capacity in the US.
According to Binam (2013), 12 redwood mills
produced 614,000 m3 of redwood lumber in 2010.
The annual production of the four California
redwood sawmills surveyed was 552,000 m3,
representing approximately 90% of the total
redwood lumber production in the US in 2010,
which was well above the original goal.

The weight-averaged annual production for the
four redwood sawmills was 174,000 m3 with a
range of 44,300-239,000 m3 of rough green
redwood
lumber.
The
weight-averaged
log
diameter was 27 cm, log length was 6.2 m, and
kiln capacity was 2830 m3. One mill did no
kiln-drying. Green chips comprised the greatest
proportion of wood residue produced at 147 oven-
dry (OD) kg/m3 planed dry redwood decking
(Table 1).
The researchers collected process-specific (ie pri-
mary) annual data from each sawmill wherever
possible. The primary data obtained from the
four
surveyed
mills
were
weight-averaged
(Milota 2004). Following CORRIM (2010)
guidelines, a mass balance (from material input
to material output for each sawmill), energy
comparison with other wood products, and a
sensitivity analysis were conducted to quantify
uncertainty in data quality.
The method used for this study was consistent
with the Mahalle and O’Connor (2009) LCA
study for western red cedar (Thuja plicata)
decking because of the large price differential
(10 to 1) between western red cedar decking
and coproducts. As is the case for western red
cedar decking, redwood decking also has a large
price differential relative to its coproducts. For
this reason, all emissions (ie environmental out-
puts) as well as the energy and material con-
sumed were assigned to the redwood decking
and no environmental burdens were assigned to
the redwood residues, including green sawdust,
chips, hog fuel, bark from sawing logs into
rough green decking, and dry shavings from the
planing process.
The LCI flows and environmental impacts of
this no-allocation approach are similar to the
revenue-allocation approach because the revenue
of redwood decking far exceeds the revenue gen-
erated from the wood residues. In the revenue-
allocation approach, the environmental burdens
are assigned based on the revenue generated
from the products and the coproducts (ie wood
residues). The coproducts are made up of green
and dry wood residues resulting from processing
the redwood logs into redwood decking.
A sensitivity analysis was conducted that allo-
cated LCI flows and environmental impacts on a
mass basis to redwood decking and its associ-
ated wood residues. The analysis determined
the difference between the no-allocation and
mass-allocation approaches. The mass-allocation
method is generally preferred for assigning
environmental outputs because the final wood
products have much greater mass than any of
the coproducts generated during the manufac-
turing
process
(CORRIM
2010;
Puettmann
et al 2010a).

sawing, drying, and planing. Energy generation
is considered as an auxiliary process.
Log yard. Diesel logging trucks transported
the redwood logs from the forest landing to the
sawmill log yard. Log transport data were not
included in the LCA results but were reported
separately. The log yard operation therefore
started with the logs already in the log yard,
with inputs and outputs evaluated when moving
the logs from the yard to the sawmill. On arrival
at the log yard, logs were scaled using the
Scribner short scale in thousand bf. In some
seasons and for some mills, logs stored in the
log yard were sprayed with a water sprinkler to
prevent checking or splitting. Log stackers or
front-end loaders were used to transport logs
from the log yard to the sawmill. Inputs included
logs with bark, electricity, water, fuel, and lubri-
cants. Outputs included logs with bark and
emissions from burning the fuels used by the
log yard machines.
Sawing. Sawing began when the logs arrived
at the debarker. In the sawing process, incoming
redwood logs were sawn into 38-  138-mm
rough green decking. Sawing logs is typically a
major source of electrical consumption for pro-
ducing lumber products such as redwood deck-
ing (Puettmann and Wilson 2005; Puettmann
et al 2010a). The rough green decking lumber
was then tallied (to measure production volume)
and, if necessary, stickered for drying. Outputs
from the sawing process (less the bark) include
rough green decking lumber (59.9%), wood chips
(22.7%), sawdust (9.5%), hog fuel (5.0%), and
shavings (1.9%). Hog fuel is comprised of a
mixture of the wood residues. Two of the saw-
mills reported that they grind their wood resi-
dues into hog fuel, and another reported that
they grind all wood residues together before
measuring them. After grinding, all green wood
residues left the system boundary with 71%
trucked off-site for use in boilers that generate
grid electricity, 25% sent to operations that
ground them into mulch, and the remaining 4%
was made into other wood products. In contrast,
many sawmills burn their wood residues to
generate process energy for their kiln driers
(Puettmann and Wilson 2005; Puettmann et al
2010a). Once sawing is complete, there are three
processing options for the rough green decking
lumber, including 1) planing on all four sides
and selling as green planed decking (7.6%);
2) selling as-is as rough green lumber (28.4%);
or 3) drying, planing, and selling as dry planed
decking (64.0%).
Drying. Rough green decking is first air-
dried to minimize kiln-drying (which is an
energy-intensive process) (Denig et al 2000;
Bergman 2010). Second-growth redwood has a
high moisture content of about 127% dry basis
(Isenberg et al 1980; Simpson 1991). Air-
drying is typically done to bring that moisture
content down to the FSP, which is about 30%.
Drying redwood decking lowers the total mass
of the lumber and decreases the volume of the
boards after they dry below the FSP (although
the mass of the wood per board remains con-
stant). Sawmills account for wood shrinkage
when sawing the logs into green lumber.
Depending on customer demand, some redwood
decking is kiln-dried before the FSP is reached.
Of the original 100% rough green decking pro-
duced, 64% was dried. After air-drying, 57% of
the incoming rough green decking was kiln-dried
to 15-19% MC. Therefore, 36.5% (¼ 64% 
57%) of total redwood decking was kiln-dried,
whereas the remaining product, 27.5% (43% *
64%), was just air-dried. Of the rough dry
decking, 1.02% was shipped rough without
being planed.
Planing. After drying, rough dry decking is
usually planed on all four sides, which produces
planer shavings, a dry wood residue. Inputs into
the planing process include dry rough redwood
decking, whereas outputs include dry planed
redwood decking (98%) and dry planer shavings
(2%). The dry planer shavings are used to fuel
an on-site wood boiler that generates energy for
the kiln dryer. Most redwood decking is sold
as dry planed decking (62.4%), whereas the
remaining 1.6% is sold as dry rough redwood
decking. Dry planed redwood decking includes
328
WOOD AND FIBER SCIENCE, JULY 2014, V. 46(3)

both air-dried decking (25.9%) and kiln-dried
decking (36.5%).
Auxiliary energy generation. The auxiliary
energy
process
provided
process
(thermal)
energy. Thermal energy used at the plant was
provided by burning a mix of natural gas and
dry wood residue generated from the planing
process. Thermal energy was also produced in
the form of steam and was used in the dry kilns.
Another major source of energy was derived
from off-site (grid) electricity, which released
emissions off-site. Outputs from this upstream
process included steam from the boilers, com-
bustion gases from the drying process, solid
waste (wood ash), and air emissions (eg CO2,
CO) from combustion.
Coproducts from the redwood decking produc-
tion process included both materials that were
sold off-site and wood residues that were burned
on-site for energy generation. In this study,
byproducts are also referred to as coproducts
because all wood residuals whether used on-site
or sold off-site had further use and were not
landfilled. In this study, when referring to logs,
lumber, and coproducts, the term green was used
in the context of freshly cut materials.
Project Assumptions
Higher heating values. This study converted
fuel from its volume or mass basis to its energy
value. Higher heating values (HHV) is the pre-
ferred method in the US to calculate energy
values (EIA 2014). HHV represents the (gross)
energy content of a fuel with the combustion
products at 25C with all water vapor brought
to liquid form.
Log conversion factor. Log volume is mea-
sured using the Scribner log scale, which reports
volume in thousand bf. This volume was con-
verted to cubic meters using a log conversion
factor of 5.37 m3/thousand bf (Fonseca 2005),
and that solid wood measure combined with
average specific gravity was used to determine
the mass balance.
Project Limitations
Omissions of life cycle stages, processes, and
input or output flows. Human labor and the
manufacturing LCA of the machinery and infra-
structure were outside the system boundaries
and therefore were not modeled in this analysis.
Cutoff rules. All materials used in the logging
and manufacturing process were tracked. Accord-
ing to the North American product category
rule, if the mass/energy of a flow is less 1% of
the cumulative mass/energy of the model flow,
it may be excluded provided its environmental
relevance is minor. This analysis included all
energy
and
mass
flows
for
primary
data
(FPInnovations 2011).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Detailed primary data on mass flow, energy con-
sumption, and fuel types were obtained from
the redwood mill surveys and collated with
upstream process data for grid electricity and
other inputs included in the SimaPro and data-
bases to produce LCI and LCIA data for red-
wood decking. We used SimaPro 7 to model the
weight-averaged survey data to estimate non-
wood raw material use and emission data on a
1-m3 unit basis. With SimaPro 7, the life cycle
data were compiled into impact measures using
the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment
of Chemical and other environmental Impacts
(TRACI) (Bare 2011) impact estimation method.
Product Yields
Mass balance. The results of a mass balance
analysis that was used to confirm the data qual-
ity obtained from surveys and site visits of the
redwood sawmills are summarized in Table 1.
In performing the mass balance for redwood
decking, all unit processes located within the
site system boundary were considered. With a
weight-averaged approach for the four surveyed
mills, 648 OD kg (1.8 m3) of incoming redwood
logs, with a green density (127% MC) of 803 kg/
m3, produced 1.0 m3 (380 OD kg) of planed
Bergman et al—LIFE CYCLE IMPACTS OF MANUFACTURING REDWOOD DECKING
329

redwood decking. The sawing process yielded
388 kg of rough green decking. No loss of wood
material occurred during the drying process.
Planing the rough lumber into surfaced decking
decreased the 388 OD kg of rough dry decking to
380 OD kg of planed dry redwood decking (a 2%
decrease in mass). All 8 OD kg of dry shavings
produced on-site were burned to produce thermal
process energy in the on-site boiler. Overall, an
average redwood log was decreased to 58.6%
(380 of 648) of its original mass during its con-
version to planed dry redwood decking. The hog
fuel listed as 32 OD kg/m3 is a mixture of wood
residues generated from the sawing process and
was not used on-site.
Carbon storage. Redwood decking stores
carbon during its service life. The carbon con-
tent for redwood has been estimated at 53% of
OD mass (Jones and O’Hara 2012). When this
carbon content factor of 0.53 and the molecular
weight ratio of CO2 (44 g/mole) and carbon
(12 g/mole) are used to calculate, the carbon
stored in 1 m3 (380 OD kg) of redwood decking
if released into the atmosphere would produce
738 kg of CO2.
Electrical Grid Composition
Table 2 shows the composite grid used in
SimaPro 7 to model the environmental effects
from using grid electricity. For redwood deck-
ing produced in northern California, the com-
posite electrical grid is comprised of the CAMX
2008
(50%)
and
the
NWPP
2008
(50%)
regional grids (EPA 2012). The CAMX 2008
and NWPP 2008 grids provide power to lower
and upper northern California, respectively.
Natural gas (35.9%), hydro (27.0%), and coal
(19.3%) are the three main contributors to the
composite electrical grid.
Energy Consumption
Overall. Redwood decking production requires
both electrical and thermal energy inputs for
processing logs into decking. Electrical energy
was required for the log yard operations, sawing,
drying, and planing unit processes. Electricity
for the sawmills was obtained off-site from the
combined NWPP/CAMX power grids (50/50) as
shown in Table 2. Thermal energy was only
used during the drying process. The mill surveys
reported that most thermal energy was produced
on-site, although one mill used waste steam
from a nearby wood-fired power plant. Primary
energy was not included in the electricity values
in Table 3. Primary energy is energy embodied
in natural resources such as biomass and fossil

fuels before conversion into useful energy.
Table 3 shows the SimaPro 7 input values
derived from a weighted average of the sawmill
survey data.
Survey results showed that 221 MJ of process
energy was consumed per cubic meter of red-
wood decking produced. Total electrical con-
sumption was 91 kWh/m3 of final product. For
the log yard operations, sawing, drying, and
planing, the consumption of the grid electrical
energy was 1.1, 67.7, 10.7, and 20.5% of the
total, respectively. Based on this breakdown,
the four unit processes used 1.0, 61.9, 9.8, and
18.7 kWh of grid electricity per cubic meter of
redwood decking produced. The major sources
of process energy were derived from the wood
fuel generated on-site during the planing process
(76.0%), from piped-in steam produced from
burning wood biomass off-site (17.6%), and
from natural gas (6.5%).
Electricity comparison. Electricity consump-
tion of 91 kWh per cubic meter of redwood
decking produced is similar to the value of
99 kWh/m3 found for manufacturing northeast
and north–central (NE/NC) US softwood lumber
(Bergman and Bowe 2010) and approximately
33% lower than the published value for western
red cedar decking (118 kWh/m3) (Mahalle and
O’Connor 2009). None of these values included
primary energy resources. Table 4 summarizes
the ancillary material consumed during the deck-
ing manufacturing process as well as amounts of
these materials used.
Cumulative energy. Table 5 shows the cumu-
lative energy consumption for a cubic meter of
planed dry redwood decking. Cumulative energy
values were determined using the HHV shown in
Table 6. Cumulative energy consumption for
manufacturing redwood decking was 1.34 GJ/m3
with wood fuel comprising about 18.8% of the
total energy input. Natural gas (33.9%) and coal
(22.5%) were the two largest energy resources
consumed during the manufacturing process,
largely because of their preponderance (35.9
and 19.3%, respectively) of regional electricity
grid production (Table 2). As shown in Table 5,
coal consumption increased as a percentage
compared with natural gas. This increase in coal
percentage occurred despite the natural gas con-
sumed at the mills because coal is only about
50% as efficient when burned to generate grid
electricity. Because coal is only 50% as efficient
as natural gas when generating grid electricity,
twice as much coal is needed as natural gas on a
per-kilowatt basis.

Bergman et al—LIFE CYCLE IMPACTS OF MANUFACTURING REDWOOD DECKING
331

Kiln-drying lumber products is energy-intensive
with the primary boiler fuel being derived from
the wood residue generated on-site (Puettmann
and Wilson 2005; Puettmann et al 2010a). Low
wood fuel consumption, as reported for redwood
decking, indicates that little kiln-drying occurs
and when it does occur, the energy input is
decreased because of the initial air-drying of
the decking lumber. Only 9.91 OD kg of wood
fuel per cubic meter of redwood decking
produced was burned for thermal energy used
on-site. Additional wood fuel amounting to
1.15 OD kg/m3 was consumed to kiln-dry the
wood stickers that are used as spacers when
stacking the redwood decking for drying. Red-
wood decking is not the only wood product to
have a low energy consumption profile. Douglas-
fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) used for structural
lumber is usually not kiln-dried. Thus, the energy
profile for green Douglas-fir looks similar to
that of redwood decking (Milota et al 2005;
Puettmann and Wilson 2005).
Energy comparison. Most wood products
consume more energy per cubic meter of final
product during the manufacturing process than
does redwood decking. In the Pacific Northwest
(PNW) of the US, the cumulative allocated
energy consumption for manufacturing 1 m3 of
planed dry softwood lumber is 3.364 GJ/m3 of
which 47% comes from wood fuel (Milota et al
2005). The values listed in Milota et al (2005)
and Puettmann et al (2010b) use mass allocation
to estimate energy consumption. This study allo-
cates all primary energy to the redwood decking
and none to the residues. Primary energy is
defined as the energy embodied in the original
resources such as natural gas and coal found in
the earth before conversion. However, the cumu-
lative energy used to manufacture redwood deck-
ing is 1.34 GJ/m3, which is only 40% of the
energy used to produce softwood lumber in the
PNW (Milota et al 2005). The low cumulative
energy for redwood decking can be attributed
largely to the minimal use of kiln-drying, which
is the most energy-intensive part of producing
dry lumber. Assigning primary energy con-
sumption and environmental outputs to both the
primary product and its associated wood resi-
dues (ie mass allocation) would further decrease
the energy values for redwood lumber.
Mass-allocation approach. As indicated in
Table 7, allocating by mass to both the product
and wood residues lowers the cumulative energy
consumption substantially. Cumulative energy
dropped to 0.951 GJ/m3 from 1.34 GJ/m3, about
a 29% decrease. This decrease was largely driven
by allocating electrical consumption between
rough green decking and the wood residues gen-
erated during the sawing process. Rough green
decking made up about 54% of the incoming log
(including bark) with the remaining log converted
into chips, sawdust, shavings, bark, and hog fuel.
This mass allocation decreased coal consumption
from 11.5 to 7.7 kg/m3. Hydro and nuclear power
use decreased similarly. Coal, hydro, and ura-
nium were only consumed to generate grid elec-
tricity, unlike wood fuel and natural gas, which
were used on-site for boiler fuel.
Fresh Water Consumption
Fresh water was used primarily for spraying the
logs in the log yard and for cooling the saw, with
most of the water being recycled back into hold-
ing ponds for reuse. Three of the four surveyed
redwood mills reported that they sprinkle their
logs with water to maintain freshness and to
prevent the logs from checking and splitting in
the hot summer sun. Fresh water consumption

rates were based on responses obtained from all
four sawmills. Surface and ground water con-
sumption were found to average 187 and 22 L/m3
of planed dry redwood decking with 86% of the
water being recycled (Table 3).
Resource Transportation
Redwood logs are transported from the forest
with diesel-powered logging trucks. Logging
trucks collect the redwood logs (127% MC) at
the forest landing and transport the logs an aver-
age of 54 km to the sawmill log yard. No other
material transported to the mill was reported to be
more than 1% of the mass of the incoming logs.
Therefore, resource transport was determined
to include only log transport for the purposes of
any calculations. Energy impacts for the resource
transport module have been reported separately.
The cumulative energy consumption during
the log transport phase was calculated to be
111 MJ/m3, and this value must be added to the
combination of forest management activities
and lumber production to calculate the cradle-
to-gate cumulative energy.
Environmental Emission Profile
Gate-to-gate. Table 8 lists the cumulative
environmental outputs generated during the pro-
duction of 1 m3 of redwood decking for the
on-site (mill only) and base-case (no-allocation)
system boundaries (Fig 2) along with the cumu-
lative outputs using a mass-allocation approach.

For the base-case cumulative system boundary,
biogenic CO2 and fossil CO2 emissions were
20.9 and 52.9 kg/m3, respectively. Fossil CO2
for the base-case cumulative case was about
seven times (52.9/7.6) the fossil CO2 emitted
on-site because the only sources of on-site fossil
CO2 came from the equipment used at the mill
facility (eg front-end loaders and forklifts).
Also, mercury emissions to the air dropped by a
factor of 86 (0.171/0.002) because coal grid
electricity, the primary source of mercury emis-
sions, occurred outside of the mill.
Coal power plants are major emitters of mercury
in the US (Pirrone et al 2010). The amount of
sulfur dioxide emitted is similar to mercury,
because its emissions correlate to coal power
production. Biogenic (biomass-based) CO2 emit-
ted from mill operations is about 67% of the
cumulative total with the remaining 33% com-
ing from wood fuel that is burned off-site to
provide thermal energy for the dry stickers that
were used as spacers between the decking dur-
ing the drying process and from steam produced
from wood fuel that was piped into the sawmill
from outside the system boundary. The alloca-
tion of biogenic CO2 emissions was approxi-
mately equal between the stickers and the piped
steam, mainly because kiln-drying the stickers
requires substantial amounts of energy. Solid
waste (wood boiler ash), such as biogenic CO2,
is generated during the consumption of wood
fuel during the manufacture of redwood decking.
There is only a slight variation in biogenic CO2
emissions between the no-allocation and mass-
allocation approaches. This slight variation occurs
because most biogenic CO2 is released during
the drying process from burning wood fuel on-site
for steam production (ie thermal energy), which
happens after the log breakdown into decking
and its associated green wood residues.
Unit processes. Table 9 portrays the air emis-
sion profiles for each unit process. Air emissions,
especially carbon emissions, are of primary
importance to many “green building” stake-
holders because carbon emissions are tied to
energy consumption and global warming. There-
fore, decreasing energy consumption during the
manufacture of building materials would aid in
decreasing the overall environmental impact of
the building. As expected, the kiln-drying pro-
cess released the most biogenic CO2 emissions,
17.6 kg/m3 of the total 20.9 kg/m3. This can be
attributed to the fact that wood fuel was burned

in the boilers to supply heat for kiln-drying
the redwood decking. In addition, the sawing
process consumed the most electricity and gener-
ated the most fossil CO2 emissions, 30.7 kg/m3
of the total 52.9 kg/m3. Other emissions, includ-
ing methane, mercury, and sulfur dioxide, are
linked to grid electricity consumption because
coal burning makes up 22.1% of the composite
grid (Table 2). Sawing released some biogenic
CO2 (3.0 kg/m3) because the wood energy con-
sumed during production of the stickers that are
used to space the decking during drying was
allocated to the sawing process. In this study,
the redwood decking was considered to be
stickered before going to the drying process
(both air-drying and kiln-drying).
An air emission comparison shows that redwood
decking generates less greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions than most other US softwood products.
For example, Puettmann et al (2010b) reported
fossil and biogenic CO2 emissions for Inland
West softwood lumber of 71.7 and 116 kg/m3,
respectively. In addition, Bergman and Bowe
(2010) reported fossil and biogenic CO2 emis-
sions for NE/NC softwood lumber of 65.1 and
187 kg/m3, respectively. The NE/NC included
log production emissions, whereas the Inland
West estimates did not. Regardless, the reported
values show the higher impacts of the drying
process if the wood product is mostly kiln-dried
instead of air-dried.
The distinction among sources of CO2 emissions
is made because GWP is reported in kg CO2
equivalents using the default TRACI impact
assessment method (Bare 2011; Branda˜o and
Levasseur 2011). This default method does not
count the CO2 emissions released during the
combustion of woody biomass during produc-
tion. Other emissions associated with wood com-
bustion such as methane or nitrogen oxides,
however, do contribute to and are included in
the GWP impact category. This approach to
reporting the impacts of biogenic CO2 is consis-
tent with the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate
Change (IPCC 2006) inventory reporting frame-
work in that there is no assumption that biomass
combustion is carbon-neutral but that net car-
bon emissions from biomass combustion are
accounted for under the Land Use Change and
Forestry Sector and are therefore ignored in
energy emissions reporting for the product LCA
to prevent double counting.
Impact Categories and Impact Measures
With the LCI flows from the individual unit pro-
cesses for the no-allocation approach, six envi-
ronmental impact categories were estimated
using TRACI 2.1 (PRe´ Consultants 2014).
Tables 10 and 11 show that GWP, AP, and RE
were highest for the sawing process whereas
ODP and EP were highest for the drying pro-
cess. Most fossil CO2 was generated during the
sawing process from burning coal and natural
gas for grid electricity, which translated into a
higher GWP. AP followed GWP because of the
fossil fuel usage for electricity. High RE impacts
can be attributed to refining natural gas. For
the drying process, burning wood for thermal
energy and refining diesel for fuel contributed
the most to ODP, whereas burning diesel and use
of coal for electricity production on the grid con-
tributed the most to EP. In addition, the log yard

process contributed the most to SP because con-
sumption of diesel burned in log yard equipment
is greater than in any other unit process. Mass-
allocation impacts were not shown but were
lower, as expected (about 38.4% less than the
no-allocation impacts on average for the six envi-
ronmental impact categories).
Carbon Balance
The carbon balance associated with the produc-
tion of redwood decking was calculated by esti-
mating the amount of carbon found in wood and
bark using a carbon content of 53% and allocat-
ing it to the wood material uses shown in Table 1.
Table 12 shows the carbon balance for 1 m3 of
dry planed redwood decking and all coproducts.
Seventy-one percent of redwood sawmill resi-
due is used for generating electricity in off-site
wood power plants to supply power to the elec-
trical grid. If the wood residue was not available,
nonrenewable resources (eg coal and natural gas)
would be required to make up the difference.
Additional carbon benefits accrued from using
the wood residue to offset power production, but
this energy impact was not considered in the
analysis. Nearly 53% of the carbon contained in
the redwood logs (including the bark) remains
stored in the redwood decking. The carbon
stored in the final product (201 kg) outweighed
all wood residue generated and is a long-term
carbon benefit because the carbon is sequestered
within the product for as long as it remains in

decking if emitted into the atmosphere as CO2

emissions released during its manufacturing.
CONCLUSIONS
Wood products store carbon while in service.
The amount of carbon stored in redwood deck-
ing if emitted into the atmosphere as CO2 is
approximately 10 times greater than the total
CO2 emissions released during manufacturing.
Low carbon manufacturing emissions and the
carbon storage inherent in redwood decking
during its service life are positive environmental
attributes that should be strongly considered
when selecting a decking product.
During the entire life cycle of wood products,
the manufacturing stage typically consumes the

most energy and releases the highest GHG emis-
sions because of the electricity used for sawing
and the energy-intensive nature of the kiln-drying
process. The release of GHG emissions is
especially high when fossil fuels are consumed
to generate steam (ie thermal energy) for the dry
kilns. Wood product manufacturing in general
typically consumes far more fossil and wood
fuel than was reported for redwood decking per
functional unit of 1 m3. This disparity between
products arises because most wood manufactur-
ing facilities, including those processing hard-
woods, kiln-dry their lumber while it is still
green. Air-drying redwood decking prior to kiln-
drying dramatically lowers energy consumption
during the manufacturing process and thus sub-
stantially lowers GHG emissions.
Air-drying also affects variation in results between
LCA allocation methods. The difference between
no-allocation and mass-allocation methods has
only a small impact on biogenic CO2 emissions
because most coproducts (ie wood residues) were
removed during the sawing process, at which
point almost 70% of the energy has already
been expended. However, biogenic CO2 is just
one of many environmental outputs that need to
be considered.
Overall, the selection of the allocation approach
does affect most of the environmental outputs
assigned to the final product. Mass allocation
for wood products results in lower environmental
burdens being assigned to the final products than
a no-allocation approach. This occurs for red-
wood decking because although it makes up
about 53% of the volume of the incoming log,
the final product carries the entire environmen-
tal burden in a no-allocation approach. There-
fore, conducting both a mass- and no-allocation
approach would show the differences if any in
the environmental outputs.
