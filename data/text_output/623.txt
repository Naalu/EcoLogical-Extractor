Before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources 
U.S. Senate 
 
 
Hearing on Forest Health Problems in the National Forests 
 
July 22, 2003 
 
 
Chairman Domenici, and members of the Committee, thank you for this opportunity to 
testify on forest health problems and to offer some solutions. Many of you have seen me 
before this Committee in the past.  I look forward to the day when my testimony will no 
longer be needed because we are implementing restoration treatments at the pace and 
scale commensurate with the problem. 
 
My name is Wallace Covington.  I am Regents’ Professor of Forest Ecology at Northern 
Arizona University and Director of the Ecological Restoration Institute.  I have been a 
professor teaching and researching fire ecology and restoration management at NAU 
since 1975.  I am a member of Governor Janet Napolitano’s Arizona Forest Health 
Advisory Council.  My role on that committee is to help develop guiding principles for 
the design and implementation of restoration-based fire fuel reduction and forest health 
projects based on the best available science.  In addition I am a member of the National 
Commission on Science for Sustainable Forestry. 
 
I have a Ph.D. in forest ecosystem analysis from Yale University and an M.S. in ecology 
from the University of New Mexico. Over the past 27 years I have taught graduate and 
undergraduate courses in research methods, ecological restoration, ecosystem 
management, fire ecology and management, forest management, range management, 
wildlife management, watershed management, recreation management, park and wildland 
management, and forest operations research.  I have been working in long-term research 
on fire ecology and management in ponderosa pine and related ecosystems since I moved 
to Northern Arizona University in 1975.  In addition to my publications on forest 
restoration, I have co-authored scientific papers on a broad variety of topics in forest 
ecology and resource management including research on fire effects, prescribed burning, 
thinning, operations research, silviculture, range management, wildlife effects, 
multiresource management, forest health, and natural resource conservation.

I will focus my remarks on two important changes that are needed to reverse the 
trend of increasing catastrophic wildfires.  
 
 First, we need to move forward with large scale restoration-based fuel 
treatments that are commensurate with the threat of catastrophic fire 
 
 Second, we need to use comprehensive restoration-based treatments as opposed 
to just thinning trees.  If we don’t we are merely treating a symptom, 
condemning ourselves to be plagued by continuing problems in the future, and 
will lose the opportunity to solve many of the problems associated with degraded 
forest ecosystems—including bark beetles and disease 
 
We need to move forward with large scale restoration-based fuel treatments that are 
commensurate with the wildfire threat 
 
The accelerating increase in the severity and size of wildfires in the West indicates that 
average annual losses over the next two decades will be in excess of 5-10 million acres 
per year.  Using the reasonable assumption that preventative restoration treatments should 
at least be at the pace and scale of losses to severe stand replacing fire, one would 
conclude that we should be treating 5-10 million acres per year.  Our current pace and 
scale is woefully inadequate given the scope of the problem.  Unless we accelerate 
treatments rapidly and immediately we will never get ahead of the problem.   
 
The fires of 2000, 2002 and now 2003 have focused policy attention on the need to create 
defensible perimeters around communities in the wildland/urban interface.  Without a 
doubt communities should be a priority for protection.  However, defining a community 
as only homes misses the whole reason why people live in forest communities.  
 
My hometown, Flagstaff, Arizona is a tourist dependent community.  In the summer it is 
a cool haven for people from Phoenix to escape oppressive heat.  In the winter it is a 
playground for skiers and snow-based recreation.  The town is populated by people who 
often choose to make less money in return for the non-monetary value of living in an 
exquisitely beautiful place. A fire of the magnitude of the Rodeo/Chediski fire—almost 
half a million acres—would destroy one of the communities most important natural 
assets.  The aesthetic and economic value of the forest is immeasurable.  Imagine 
Flagstaff, Santa Fe, New Mexico, Durango, Colorado or any other mountain town 
surrounded by a sea of blackened trunks.  The spiritual, social and economic value of 
being there is gone.   
 
Besides the inextricable link of people to the forest, there are many important 
environmental and resource benefits provided by forests, such as water, wildlife, 
recreation and wood fiber.  To protect these values will require landscape scale 
treatments in the greater forest.

The need for landscape assessments to identify key elements of the landscape for 
protection 
 
The logical and efficient way to strategically and comprehensively address the threat of 
unnatural wildfire is to look at the problem from a landscape perspective.  Using a 
collaborative community process with a definite timeframe, we can identify important 
elements of the landscape for protection, identify the location and type of restoration fuel 
breaks that would reduce the risk of unnatural fire, and prioritize areas for treatments.  
Areas that are at highest risk or where we can gain the greatest advantage for fire 
protection would logically be treated first.   This type of approach is not widely used but 
should be so that limited resources are used effectively.  
 
Adaptive management provides the proper framework for action 
 
Working at the landscape scale concerns some individuals and organizations.  However, 
there is an approach that will ensure that we are learning from and evolving treatments 
based on best available information—it is a “learning by doing” approach known as 
active adaptive management. No one is talking about tinkering here and this isn’t just 
some new fangled academic idea.  Adaptive management is rooted deep in theory and 
practice, having sprung from the evolutionary operations approach long used in 
optimizing complex chemical engineering problems.  Crawford S. Holling (University of 
Florida) and Carl Walters (University of British Columbia) and their intellectual 
“offspring” have developed this approach as a tried and true procedure for solving 
complex resource management problems, monitoring and evaluating a range of policy 
options, and then feeding resulting knowledge back into the ongoing resource 
management endeavor.   
 
There are quantifiable approaches to adaptive management.  However, a “soft systems” 
approach might be most appropriate for restoration of ponderosa pine and related 
frequent fire landscapes.  This is an approach used by the Greater Flagstaff Forests 
Partnership.  The Partnership is attempting to plan and implement restoration-based fuel 
reduction projects on 100,000 acres in and around Flagstaff.  The Partnership is engaged 
in planning for its third major treatment—an area of 30,000 acres.  Information learned 
from the monitoring of earlier treatments applied in 1998 is being used to design the next 
series of treatments.   
 
The safest way to advance treatment design and implementation is to apply scientifically 
rigorous adaptive management principles.  By scientifically rigorous I mean that the 
design of landscape scale restoration treatments must be based on: 
 
1. Comprehensive awareness of solid science (not ideologically driven, 
selective citation of existing knowledge). 
2. Implementing large-scale, adaptive management experiments to test ideas. 
3. Monitoring fundamental parameters to determine treatment effectiveness. 
4. Objective scientific analysis of the results.

5. Further adaptation of management experiments suggested by these 
monitoring observations. 
6. Sharing, publicizing and publishing results for lay audiences, policy makers, 
resource management professionals, and the scientific community. 
 
We need to use comprehensive restoration-based treatments as opposed to just 
thinning trees.  If we don’t we are merely treating a symptom, condemning 
ourselves to be plagued by the problem again in the future, and will lose the 
opportunity to solve many of the problems associated with degraded forest 
ecosystems 
 
I am gravely concerned that in our urgency to treat forests quickly, we will do it 
incorrectly by focusing solely on removing trees.  If we do that we will squander the 
opportunity to provide a comprehensive solution to all the problems confronting 
degraded forests.   
 
We have been in open revolt against nature in the dry forests of the West since 
settlement. It is time to start managing in harmony with natural tendencies.  Science-
based forest restoration treatments are consistent with natural tendencies.  
Comprehensive restoration is superior to forest thinning alone for one significant 
reason—restoration treatments simultaneously improve forest health (the underlying 
cause of catastrophic fire) while reducing fire risk.  Restoration treatments permit the safe 
reintroduction of low intensity ground fire that we can let burn without threatening 
people and homes and most importantly plays a vital role in restoring the forest.  
 
Restoration has many benefits 
 
The benefits of ecological restoration and diligent land stewardship in ponderosa pine and 
related ecosystems are many and they are sustainable indefinitely.  Ecological restoration:  
 
1. Eliminates unnatural forest insect and disease outbreaks—such as the current 
bark beetle epidemic  
2. Enhances native plant and animal biodiversity 
3. Protects critical habitats for threatened or endangered species 
4. Improves watershed function and sustainability 
5. Enhances natural beauty of the land 
6. Improves resource values for humans, not just for current, but also for future 
generations

Designing restoration treatments 
 
There is no “one size fits all” restoration treatment. Intelligent restoration treatments are 
based on the historic conditions of the land.  We know that ponderosa pine forests in the 
Southwest burned frequently with the net effect of killing small trees and enhancing 
fewer, large trees.  We know that the real diversity of the ponderosa pine forest is below 
your knees in the grasses and shrubs and that they need fire and light to survive.  We also 
know that the Southwest is prone to periods of sustained drought and that there are only 
so many trees per acre that can be sustained in an arid climate.  
 
Ecological restoration should strive towards emulating, insofar as is practical natural 
ecosystem patterns and processes.  In the discipline of ecological restoration we refer to 
these natural conditions as “reference conditions”.  In most cases for ponderosa pine 
forests this includes fewer trees per acre; retaining older trees and removing the excess 
trees thus opening up the forest canopy to promote increased numbers and species of 
plants and grasses.   
 
Research across the Intermountain West has shown that restoration treatments 
substantially reduce fire hazard by thinning trees to decrease tree canopy density, break 
up interconnected canopy fuels, raise the crown base height, and then reduce accumulated 
forest floor fuels and debris with prescribed fire.  Where tree density is great, fire alone is 
inadequate.  Without thinning, fire can lead to increased mortality, especially among old 
growth trees.  This is the typical case over most of the ponderosa pine type throughout 
the West. 
 
Restoration thinning enhances the productivity (growth) of trees, allowing young trees to 
develop old-growth characteristics such as large size and full crowns.  Perhaps most 
importantly, restoration has been shown to increase rapidly the productivity of native 
understory grasses and herbs, the species that make up 90-99% of the plant biological 
diversity in western fire-adapted forests.  The resources provided by abundant understory 
vegetation—seeds, flowers, fruits, and cover—translate into key wildlife habitat 
components.  For example, the number of butterfly species and individuals increased 
within two years in Arizona sites that had received ecological restoration treatments.   
 
Our research in cooperation with land management agencies and community groups  
shows that restoration treatments are operationally sound.  There are some very simple 
restoration-based sideboards for designing alternative prescriptions that are 
straightforward and well supported.  They include:  
  
1. Retain all trees which predate settlement 
2. Retain postsettlement trees needed to re-establish presettlement structure 
3. Thin and remove excess trees 
4. Rake heavy fuels from base of trees 
5. Burn to emulate natural disturbance regime 
6. Seed with natives/control exotics

 We know what to do and it makes economic sense 
 
I have great faith in our scientific understanding of how to restore degraded forest.  Yet I 
am frustrated that with so much knowledge at hand we remain mired in ideological 
disputes.  Recently, the School of Forestry at Northern Arizona University completed an 
economic study analyzing the cost of restoration versus taking no action in ponderosa 
pine forests.  This preliminary analysis shows that it is cost effective to spend up to 
$505/acre to restore forests to prevent catastrophic fire and avoid associated fire 
suppression costs.  In other words, if we spend money to restore forests now, we will 
avoid spending that much on just suppression, rehabilitation and lost timber value in the 
future.  This figure doesn’t even take into account what is spent on lost property, lost 
property taxes, lost fire fighter lives and the full reality of losses associated with 
catastrophic fire.  Based on this figure, a back of the envelope assessment shows that to 
treat the condition class 3 lands identified in the Intermountain West (and we really 
wouldn’t want to treat all those acres of different forest types) it would cost $6 billion 
dollars.  With our annual suppression costs rising to above $1 billion per year, and an 
annual federal budget that exceeds two trillion dollars the logic to spend the money and 
get this done is overwhelming. 
 
In conclusion I want to say exactly what I have said to Congress before.  Knowing 
what we now know, it would be grossly negligent for our generation not to move 
forward with large scale restoration-based fuel treatments in the dry forests of the 
West.  Inaction is clearly the greatest threat to the long-term sustainability of these 
western ecosystems.
