Summary
1. Westoby’s [Plant and Soil (1998), 199, 213] Leaf-Height-Seed (LHS) plant strategy scheme
quantiﬁes the strategy of a plant based on its location in a three-dimensional space deﬁned by
three functional traits: speciﬁc leaf area (SLA), height, and seed mass. This scheme is based on
aboveground traits and may neglect strategies of belowground resource capture if root function-
ing is not mirrored in any of the axes. How then do ﬁne roots ﬁt into the LHS scheme?
2. We measured 10 functional traits on 133 plant species in a ponderosa pine forest in northern
Arizona, USA. This data set was used to evaluate how well the LHS scheme accounts for the
variation in above and belowground traits.
3. The three most important plant strategies were composed of multiple correlated traits, but
SLA, seed mass, and height loaded on separate principle components. The ﬁrst axis reﬂected the
widely observed ‘leaf economics spectrum’. Species at the high end of this spectrum had high
SLA, high leaf and ﬁne root nitrogen (N) concentration, and low leaf dry matter content. The
second axis reﬂected variation in seed mass and ﬁne root morphology. Plants at the positive end
of this spectrum were plants with large seeds and low speciﬁc root length (SRL). The third axis
reﬂected variation in height and phenology. Plants at the positive end of this spectrum were tall
species that ﬂower late in the growing season.
4. Leaf N concentration was positively correlated with ﬁne root N concentration. SRL was
weakly positively correlated with SLA. SRL was not correlated with ﬁne root N concentration.
Leaf litter decomposition rate was positively correlated with the leaf economics spectrum and
was negatively correlated with the height and phenology spectrum.
5. Leaf traits, seed mass, and height appear to be integrating properties of species that reﬂect
much of the variation in plant function, including root function. Fine root N concentration was
positively mirrored by the leaf economics spectrum, and SRL was inversely mirrored by seed
mass. The leaf and height axes play a role in controlling leaf litter decomposability, indicating
that these strategy axes have important consequences for ecosystem functioning.

Introduction
Plants are multifaceted organisms that have evolved ecolog-
ical strategies for sustaining populations in resource-limited
environments (Grime 1979; Craine 2009). Plant strategies
can be quantiﬁed by measuring functional traits (Grime
et al. 1997; Reich et al. 2003), which are the properties of
plants that impact plant ﬁtness (Violle et al. 2008) and
ecosystem processes (Lavorel & Garnier 2002). Compari-
sons of functional traits across taxa have provided insight
into the primary functional gradients among plants (e.g.
Grime et al. 1997; Reich et al. 1999; Craine et al. 2001; Dı´az
et al. 2004). One important gradient describes differences in
resource acquisition (Reich, Walters & Ellsworth 1997),
known as the ‘leaf economics spectrum’ (sensu Wright et al.
2004a), which runs from plants with quick returns on
investment in nutrients and dry matter [i.e. plants with
leaves that have high photosynthetic rates, short life spans,

high SLA, and high leaf nitrogen (N) concentrations] to
plants with slower returns on their investments. This
multi-trait spectrum (or strategy axis) is only one out of
potentially many spectra important to plant growth, repro-
duction, and survival (Reich et al. 2003; Craine 2009).
Westoby (1998) proposed a simple ‘Leaf-Height-Seed’
(LHS) scheme that operationally quantiﬁes the strategy of a
plant species by its location in a three-dimensional space
deﬁned by three functional traits: speciﬁc leaf area, height,
and seed mass. Speciﬁc leaf area (SLA, leaf area per unit
dry mass) represents variation along the leaf economics
spectrum and is indicative of a species’ ability to respond to
opportunities for rapid growth (Reich et al. 1999). Plant
height at maturity has been related to competitive ability
and fecundity (Keddy & Shipley 1989; Aarssen & Jordan
2001). Seed mass reﬂects variation in dispersal capability
and cotyledon-stage seedling survivorship (Westoby, Leish-
man & Lord 1996; Jakobsson & Eriksson 2000). This LHS
plant ecology strategy scheme is potentially useful since it
requires the measurement of only three easy-to-measure
traits. However, plant strategies are thought to be gradients
in multiple correlated traits rather than gradients in single
traits (Reich et al. 2003). Moreover, any plant strategy
scheme based entirely on aboveground traits may neglect
strategies of belowground resource capture if root function-
ing is not mirrored in any of the three axes. How then do
ﬁne roots ﬁt into the LHS scheme?
Root traits are harder to measure and have received far
less attention than aboveground traits, despite the fact that
most of the biomass and production in perennial-dominated
ecosystems is belowground, and that many important eco-
system processes are tightly coupled with plant roots and
rhizospheres (Aerts & Chapin 2000). There is some evidence
for a ‘root economics spectrum’ analogous to tradeoffs seen
in leaves (Eissenstat & Yanai 1997). For example, ﬁne root
N concentration scales positively with leaf N concentration
(Craine & Lee 2003; Tjoelker et al. 2005; Kerkhoff et al.
2006). A recent analysis by Kembel et al. (2008) indicates
that there are at least two gradients of root function. The
strongest gradient suggests that species with fast relative
growth rates have high leaf and root N concentrations,
shorter-lived roots, and high SLA, indicating that roots and
leaves are functionally coordinated. The weaker orthogonal
axis described variation in speciﬁc root length. Speciﬁc root
length (SRL, root length per unit root dry mass) of ﬁne
absorptive roots has been suggested to be the belowground
analogue to SLA (Cornelissen et al. 2003). SRL is indicative
of the potential rate of water and nutrient uptake and is
considered to be a morphological index of belowground
competitive ability (Lambers, Chapin & Pons 1998). SLA
and ﬁne root SRL were uncorrelated among a set of grass-
land species despite the positive association between leaf
and ﬁne root tissue chemistry (Tjoelker et al. 2005). Some
studies have illustrated positive relationships between rela-
tive growth rate (which scales positively with SLA; Lambers
& Poorter 1992) and SRL (Reich et al. 1998; Wright &
Westoby 1999), whereas others have reported opposite
trends (Boot 1989; Lambers & Poorter 1992) or even no
relationship (Poorter & Remkes 1990; Huante, Rincon &
Gavito 1992). If an independent root economics spectrum
exists, then the LHS scheme may need additional dimen-
sions (Westoby et al. 2002; Westoby & Wright 2006), but if
leaf and root traits are functionally coordinated, then the
LHS scheme will be supported because variation in root
traits will be mirrored by aboveground traits.
Functional traits not only deﬁne plant strategies for sur-
vival, they are thought to inﬂuence important ecosystem
processes (Chapin et al. 2000). Decomposition of leaf litter
is one critical step in the internal recycling of limiting nutri-
ents. Decomposition rates are partly controlled by tissue
nutrient concentration and the density of structural material
in the leaf (Cornwell et al. 2008), suggesting that the leaf axis
in the LHS scheme controls leaf litter decomposition rates.
We quantiﬁed 10 functional traits on 133 plant species
that commonly occur in southwestern USA Pinus ponderosa
var. scopulorum P. & C. Lawson (ponderosa pine) forests. In
addition to SLA, height, seed mass, SRL, leaf N and ﬁne
root N, we measured four additional traits that can inﬂuence
plant ﬁtness: leaf phosphorus concentration, which has been
shown to be an important component of the leaf economics
spectrum (Wright et al. 2004a); ﬂowering date and duration,
which summarize phonological aspects of a species’ life his-
tory (Grime et al. 1997); and leaf dry matter content
(LDMC, ratio of leaf dry mass to fresh mass), which is indic-
ative of the amount of structural material in a leaf (Garnier
et al. 2001; Kazakou et al. 2006). We asked the following
questions: (1) Is the LHS scheme supported when multiple
traits, including root traits, are assessed simultaneously in a
multivariate framework? (2) Are root traits correlated with
leaf traits? (3) Do the LHS axes explain variation in leaf litter
decomposition rates?
Materials and methods
STUDY SYSTEM
This is the ﬁrst study to document functional traits for the common
plant species found in the widespread semi-arid ponderosa pine forest
ecosystem in the southwestern USA. Water and nitrogen are the pri-
mary limiting resources in this ecosystem. Frequent low-intensity sur-
face ﬁre was historically the most important disturbance agent
(Moore, Covington & Fule´ 1999). These ﬁres maintained a savanna-
like system where clumps of large trees persisted amidst a matrix of a
grassy understory, but ﬁre suppression over the last century has
caused tree densities to increase dramatically. In dense forest stands,
the ponderosa pine overstory suppresses understory production and
diversity (Laughlin et al. 2008). In open stands, the understory is
dominated by both C3 and C4 bunchgrasses and forbs, which com-
prise the majority of the species pool.
This study was conducted on a 12 000 ha landscape in the Co-
conino National Forest near Flagstaff, Arizona, USA. The mean
annual precipitation of Flagstaff is 56 cm and the mean annual
temperature is 7Æ7 C (Kohn & Welker 2005). Southwestern USA
ponderosa pine forests occur across a broad edaphic gradient and
therefore have a large species pool (Laughlin & Abella 2007). We

chose to study 133 species that were detected either historically or cur-
rently on a set of long-term permanent plots. These species span 33
taxonomic families and 95 genera, and includes 88 C3 forbs, 13C3
grasses, nine C3 legumes, three C3 shrubs, two C3 trees, 14 C4 grasses,
and four CAM forbs. All nomenclature follows the USDA NRCS
Plants Database (http://plants.usda.gov/) accessed in 2009.
FUN CTIONAL TRAITS
Plants were sampled from the same study sites from which the species
list was generated. In cases where species occurred at more than one
site, traits were measured at multiple sites. Following the recommen-
dations of Cornelissen et al. (2003), we measured traits on robust, un-
grazed plants grown in well-lit environments. When measuring traits
on species that are adapted to shady conditions (e.g. Carex geophila,
Thalictrum fendleri), we tried to sample individuals in canopy open-
ings. Sampling began in May 2008 and ended in September 2008. The
Flagstaff region received c. 47 cm of precipitation during the water
year of 2008 (http://www.wrcc.dri.edu) and the Palmer Drought
Severity Index for the same time period was c. 0Æ7 (http://
www.ncdc.noaa.gov), each indicating that plants were sampled
during a climatically average year.
We measured a core set of functional traits that reﬂect aspects of
each species’ ability to disperse, establish, acquire water and nutrients,
and photosynthesize (Weiher et al. 1999; Cornelissen et al. 2003). For
all 133 species we measured SLA, height, seed mass, SRL, leaf N con-
centration, ﬁne root N concentration, leaf phosphorus concentration,
and LDMC. Julian ﬂowering date and ﬂowering duration were also
obtained for each species. We measured leaf litter decomposition
rates on 103 species. See Table S1 in electronic Supporting Informa-
tion for mean trait values for every trait on all species in the study.
SLA is the ratio of leaf area to dry weight expressed as mm2 mg)1.
SLA was measured on ten to twenty individuals when the species was
ﬂowering. We non-randomly selected one fully expanded, healthy leaf
from each individual for this measurement. One-sided leaf area was
measured using the Agvis Imaging System (Decagon Devices, Pull-
man, WA, USA) within 5 h of harvesting. The leaf petiole and rachis
on compound leaves were retained for this measurement. Leaves were
oven-dried for 72 h at 55 C prior to obtaining dry weights.
Canopy height is the height of the foliage (not the height of the
inﬂorescence) of a species measured in cm. Height was measured on
robust ﬂowering individuals and therefore reﬂects an average maxi-
mum height for each species.
Seed mass is the oven-dry mass of an average seed expressed in mg.
When possible, seeds were harvested from several individuals of each
species. Seeds housed inside ﬂeshy fruits (e.g., Rosa woodsii) were
removed from the fruiting structures, and if a pappus was present it
was removed (Weiher et al. 1999). Mean seed mass was determined
by weighing the total mass of between 20 and 100 individual seeds
(depending on the species), then dividing the total dry weight by the
number of seeds in the sample.
Leaf dry matter content (LDMC) is the ratio of leaf dry mass to
fresh mass expressed as mg mg)1. LDMC was not measured on the
same leaves that were used to measure SLA. LDMC was measured
on leaves harvested from two individuals of each species, and variance
of this trait within each species was very low (see also Weiher et al.
1999). Following Garnier et al. (2001), the shoots were harvested and
placed in humid plastic bags in the ﬁeld. Within 5 h, we re-cut each
stem under water, and keeping the cut ends submerged, stored them
in a refrigerator for 24 h to fully rehydrate the leaves. This procedure
is necessary because LDMC is sensitive to hourly ﬂuctuations in leaf
water status (Garnier et al. 2001). After bringing the leaves back to
room temperature, we weighed the rehydrated leaves to obtain ‘fresh
weights’. Leaves were then oven-dried for 72 h at 55 C prior to
obtaining dry weights.
Foliar concentrations of nitrogen (Nmass) and phosphorus (Pmass)
were determined on at least three (often ﬁve) individual replicates
per species. Fully expanded, healthy leaves were harvested from the
entire axis of a plant when it was ﬂowering. Samples were oven-
dried for 72 h at 55 C, then ground to <0Æ5 mm using a Wiley
Mill (Thompson Scientiﬁc, Swedesboro, NJ, USA). Foliar Nmass
was analyzed on a Flash EA 1112 Elemental Analyzer (CE Elan-
tech Inc., Lakewood, NJ, USA) at the United States Department
of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research
Station (RMRS) Analytical Lab in Flagstaff, Arizona, USA. To
determine Pmass, we digested ground leaf matter with sulfuric acid,
potassium sulphate and copper sulphate in a block digestor to con-
vert the phosphorus in the samples to orthophosphate. These sam-
ples
were
analyzed
on
a

(Lachat
Instruments, Inc., Milwaukee, WI, USA) at the USDA Forest Ser-
vice RMRS in Flagstaff, Arizona, USA.
Speciﬁc root length is the ratio of ﬁne root length to dry mass
expressed as m g)1. Speciﬁc root length was measured on three indi-
viduals of each species during the latter part of the growing season.
We excavated entire root systems from the soil with shovels and trow-
els, and gently washed soil from the roots in the laboratory with clean
water rinses. Following the standardized protocol of Cornelissen
et al. (2003), we used the ﬁne (<2 mm) absorptive roots (i.e. unsuber-
ized, often with evidence of root tips or hairs) in our determination of
SRL. Only a subsample of ﬁne roots from each individual was used in
the measurement. This method yields a measure that better mirrors
its aboveground analogue SLA (Cornelissen et al. 2003). The vast
majority of the ﬁne roots that we harvested were <0Æ5 mm. Root
length was measured using the software WINRHIZO V. 2003a (Regent
Instruments, Nepean, Ontario, Canada). Roots were then oven-dried
for 72 h at 55 C prior to obtaining dry weights.
Fine root Nmass was measured on the same roots used in the deter-
mination of SRL. After drying for 72 h at 55 C, ﬁne roots were
ground to <0Æ5 mm in a Wiley Mill and were analyzed on a Flash
EA 1112 Elemental Analyzer at the USDA Forest Service RMRS in
Flagstaff, Arizona, USA.
Mean Julian ﬂowering dates and ﬂowering duration for each spe-
cies were determined using regional ﬂoras that describe the ﬁrst and
last months that a species is in ﬂower. For example, Artemisia carru-
thii ﬂowers from August through October, which corresponds to the
Julian days 213 through 304. Therefore, the mean Julian ﬂowering
day = (213 + 304) ⁄ 2 = 259,
and
the
ﬂowering
duration =
304)213 = 91 days. Data primarily came from McDougall (1973),
but for some species we used data from the Intermountain Flora
(Cronquist et al. 1986+) or the Flora of North America (Flora of
North America Editorial Committee 1993+).
Species-speciﬁc leaf litter decomposition rates were quantiﬁed
using litterbags (Harmon, Nadelhoffer & Blair 1999) inside an
experimental exclosure at the G. A. Pearson Natural Area (located
10 km northwest of Flagstaff, Arizona, USA) from October 2007
to September 2008. Green (i.e. non-senesced) leaves were collected
from living plants from 103 species. Litterbags had an inside area
of 20 · 20 cm constructed with window screen material (1 · 2 mm
mesh). Approximately 2 g of leaf dry mass were placed in these
bags. Decomposition rates were determined for 103 of the 133 spe-
cies in the study. The most dominant species (n = 53) had two
independent replicates, and the remainder of the species (n = 50)

were not replicated. Litterbags were placed on the surface of the
forest ﬂoor in an open, well-lit environment. After the harvest, we
removed any soil particles from the decomposed litter with brushes
prior to drying at 55 C for 72 h to obtain oven-dry weights. The
decomposition rates reported here reﬂect the proportional mass loss
over a 1-year period.
DATA ANALYSES
We evaluated Westoby’s (1998) LHS scheme by subjecting the large
species-trait matrix that included root traits to a principal compo-
nents analysis (PCA). If the LHS model is robust, then SLA, height,
and seed mass will each load highly on the ﬁrst three components,
respectively, and root traits will either load on the ﬁrst three axes, or
they will contribute to additional dimensions. Following Westoby
(1998), all variables were log10-transformed because trait values can
vary by orders of magnitude, and because traits are often lognormally
distributed between species. We calculated the eigenvalues and eigen-
vectors of the correlation matrix (see Table S2 in electronic Support-
ing Information) using SAS-JMP version 8.0. Decomposition rate was
not included as a variable in the matrix because rates were determined
for only 103 species. We used ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD (Honestly Sig-
niﬁcant Difference) post-hoc tests to determine how plant functional
types (C3 forbs, C3 legumes, C3 woody plants, C3 graminoids, C4
graminoids, and CAM forbs) differed in each of the three major axis
scores.
We evaluated the relationship between leaf and ﬁne root traits. The
results of the PCA informed our evaluation, but we also used regres-
sion analysis to determine the strength and sign of the relationship
between: SLA and SRL; leaf Nmass and ﬁne root Nmass; and ﬁne root
Nmass and the leaf economics spectrum (quantiﬁed by the axis scores
of the ﬁrst principal component, see Results). We also evaluated the
relationship between SRL and ﬁne root Nmass.
We used simple linear and backward multiple regression analyses
to evaluate the relationships between leaf litter decomposition rate
and four leaf traits (SLA, LDMC, leaf Nmass, leaf Pmass) to determine
which trait or combination of traits were the best predictors of decom-
position rate. In addition, we used linear and multiple regression to
determine whether any of the ﬁrst three principal components (i.e.
plant strategy axes) were correlated with leaf litter decomposition
rate.
Results
THE LEAF-HEIGH T-SEED STRATEGY SCHEME
The 133 plant species exhibited broad ranges in each of the
10 functional traits (see Table S3 in electronic Supporting
Information). Three principal components accounted for
58% of the total variance of the species-trait correlation
matrix (Table 1).
The ﬁrst principal component (PC1) accounted for 25%
of the total variance and represented an axis of resource
acquisition and turnover consistent with the leaf economics
spectrum. Species found at the positive end of this spectrum
exhibited high SLA, leaf Nmass, and ﬁne root Nmass, and
low LDMC (Fig. 1, Table 1). SLA exhibited the highest
loading on PC1.
The second principal component (PC2) accounted for an
additional 20% of the total variance and represented varia-
tion in seed mass, root morphology, and leaf Nmass. Species
found at the positive end of PC2 had large seeds, low SRL
and high leaf Nmass (Fig. 1, Table 1). Seed mass exhibited
the highest loading on PC2 (Table 1).
The third principal component (PC3) accounted for an
additional 13% of the total variance and represented varia-
tion in height, ﬂowering date and ﬂowering duration. Spe-
cies found at the positive end of PC3 were tall species that
ﬂowered late in the season for only a short duration (Fig. 1,
Table 1). Height exhibited the highest loading on PC3
(Table 1).
Plant functional types accounted for some of the varia-
tion in axis scores (Fig. 2). C3 forbs, C3 legumes, and CAM
forbs were located at the high end of the leaf economics
spectrum (PC1), whereas C3 woody plants and both C3 and
C4 graminoids were located at the low end (Fig. 2a). Plant
functional types accounted for 31% of the variation of PC1.
C3 legumes and C3 woody plants were located at the high
end of the seed mass spectrum (Fig. 2b). C3 graminoids had
larger seeds and lower SRL than C4 graminoids (Fig. 2b).
Plant functional types accounted for 40% of the variation
in PC2. Other than C3 woody plants being taller than most
other species in the ﬂora, plant functional types accounted
for only 11% of the variance in PC3 (Fig. 2c).
LEAF AND F INE ROOT TRAITS
Leaf Nmass was positively correlated with ﬁne root Nmass
(Fig. 3a). Similarly, the leaf economics spectrum, as repre-
sented by the ﬁrst principal component, was positively cor-
related with ﬁne root Nmass (Fig. 3b). Fine root Nmass
loaded most strongly on PC1 (Table 1).
Speciﬁc root length was not correlated with ﬁne root
Nmass (Fig. 3c, P = 0Æ65), and SRL was only weakly posi-
tively correlated with SLA (Fig. 3d). Speciﬁc root length
loaded most strongly on PC2 (Table 1).

PLANT STRATEGIES AND LEAF LI TTER DEC OM POSITION
Using data measured on 103 species, leaf litter decomposi-
tion rate was positively correlated with SLA (R2 = 0Æ07,
P = 0Æ0078), leaf Nmass (Fig. 4a, R2 = 0Æ18, P < 0Æ0001),
and leaf Pmass (R2 = 0Æ04, P = 0Æ0339), and was negatively
correlated with LDMC (Fig. 4b, R2 = 0Æ22, P < 0Æ0001).
A multiple regression model with LDMC (partial r2 = 0Æ10,
P < 0Æ0001) and leaf Nmass (partial r2 = 0Æ07, P = 0Æ0026)
as predictors explained 27% of the variance in decomposi-
tion rate (proportion mass loss = 0Æ34 + logLeafN · 0Æ29
– logLDMC · 0Æ31).
The leaf economics spectrum (i.e. PC1) was signiﬁcantly
positively correlated with decomposition rate (Fig. 4c). The
seed mass and root morphology spectrum (i.e. PC2) was not
signiﬁcantly correlated with decomposition rate (R2 = 0Æ04,
P = 0Æ053). The height and phenology spectrum (i.e. PC3)
was weakly negatively correlated with litter mass loss
(Fig. 4d). A multiple regression model with PC1 (partial
r2 = 0Æ18,
P < 0Æ0001)
and
PC3
(partial
r2 = 0Æ08,
P = 0Æ0020) as predictors explained 26% of the variance in
leaf litter decomposition rate (proportion mass loss =
0Æ64 + PC1 · 0Æ04 – PC3 · 0Æ04).
Discussion
Westoby’s (1998) Leaf-Height-Seed plant ecology strategy
scheme was well supported in this multi-trait analysis of 133
species. The three principle strategies were composed of
multiple correlated traits, but SLA, seed mass, and height
loaded on separate axes. The LHS scheme also accounts for
belowground plant function since root traits were correlated
with aboveground traits.
The leaf economics spectrum is one important axis of spe-
cialization in this ﬂora, and it likely plays a role in control-
ling productivity, litter decomposition, and N cycling. The
leaf economics spectrum represents a fundamental tradeoff
between species with traits that confer rapid acquisition of
resources and rapid turnover of biomass vs. species that efﬁ-
ciently conserve their slowly acquired resources. This axis
reﬂects a gradient in litter decomposition rate because spe-
cies with high SLA, low LDMC and high leaf Nmass (e.g.
Chenopodium graveolens, Oxalis sp., Chamaesyce serpyllifo-
lia) decompose more rapidly than species at the opposite
end of the spectrum (e.g., trees, such as Pinus ponderosa and
Quercus gambelii).
Leaf Nmass is well known as a predictor of litter decompo-
sition rate (Cornwell et al. 2008), but the ability to predict
decomposition rates from LDMC is relatively new. Quested
et al. (2007) found that community-aggregated LDMC was
the best predictor of community litter decomposition rates.
Our results show that LDMC was negatively correlated with
decomposition rate, and that LDMC is an important com-
ponent of the leaf economics spectrum (Wilson, Thompson
& Hodgson 1999). LDMC is likely a good predictor of

species that occur in southwestern USA ponderosa pine forests. Only the ﬁrst two principal component scores are plotted here explicitly. Labels

decomposition rate because it has been shown to be posi-
tively correlated with lignin concentration (Kazakou et al.
2006), which is slow to break down. Predicting decomposi-
tion rate from LDMC alone may be especially useful since
LDMC is simpler to measure and less expensive than mea-
suring leaf nutrient concentrations. These results suggest
that plant strategies, such as the leaf economics spectrum,
can have signiﬁcant consequences for ecosystem processes,
such as carbon and nutrient cycling (Cornwell et al. 2008).
There was a clear positive link between leaf Nmass and ﬁne
root Nmass. The positive relationship is one of the few con-
sistent linkages between leaf and root traits (Craine & Lee
2003). Because leaf Nmass is known to inﬂuence decomposi-
tion rates (Cornwell et al. 2008), species with rapidly
decomposing leaf litter will likely also have rapidly decom-
posing ﬁne roots. Species with high ﬁne root Nmass also have
short root lifespans (Kembel et al. 2008), and species with
high root tissue density also have high LDMC (Wahl & Ry-
ser 2000). These results imply that there is functional coor-
dination between roots and shoots (Grime 1979), but SRL
does not reﬂect this coordination.
The second axis of specialization in this ﬂora reﬂects a
gradient in seed mass and SRL. Variation in seed mass
reﬂects the fundamental tradeoff between seed output and
seed size (Henery & Westoby 2001) and between seed size
and persistence in the seed bank (Thompson, Band &
Hodgson 1993). Annual plants, such as the two Drymaria
spp., are examples of small-seeded species that produce
many seeds that emerge from the soil seed bank each year
during the wet season. This axis also represents a gradient
from species with high SRL and low seed mass to low SRL
and high seed mass. Reich et al. (1998) found that seed mass
and SRL were also inversely correlated among nine boreal
tree species, but the relationship was less pronounced in
other studies (Gross, Maruca & Pregitzer 1992; Huante,
Rincon & Gavito 1992). Perhaps small-seeded species
require high SRL in order to rapidly obtain water and min-
eral nutrients in the absence of endosperm reserves. Seed-
lings may have different SRL than adult plants, so this
interpretation is somewhat confounded by ontogeny. Sev-
eral studies have suggested a negative relationship between
seed mass and relative growth rate (Hunt & Cornelissen
1997; Reich et al. 1998; Wright & Westoby 1999), but the
pattern is not universal (Shipley & Peters 1990). Species
with high SRL exhibit a root morphology that is conducive
to more rapid acquisition of water and mineral nutrients
(Lambers, Chapin & Pons 1998), which should allow the
species to grow faster in productive environments (Grime
et al. 1997). If this interpretation is correct, then SRL
should have been positively correlated with the leaf eco-
nomics spectrum. Other studies have shown strong correla-
tions between SRL and SLA (Reich et al. 1998; Wright &
Westoby 1999) for seedlings grown in pots. However, SRL
and tissue Nmass were uncorrelated in this study and in
another comparative analysis (Tjoelker et al. 2005).
What can explain the lack of covariance between SRL
and the leaf economics spectrum? SRL is a composite met-
ric of both ﬁne root diameter and tissue density. Species
with identical SRL may have different diameters and tissue
density, indicating different functional responses to gradi-
ents in resources. Unfortunately, data on tissue density is
not available for comparison in this study. Furthermore,
SRL is but one simple aspect of belowground resource cap-
ture and does not take into account total root mass, root-
to-shoot ratio, root turnover, distribution of ﬁne roots
throughout the soil proﬁle, root architecture, or foraging

tion along the (a) leaf economics spectrum (PC1), (b) seed mass and
SRL spectrum (PC2), and (c) height and phenology spectrum (PC3).
The three shrubs and two trees were combined into a ‘C3 woody
plants’ group for simplicity. Each of the three ANOVA tests were signiﬁ-
cant (P < 0Æ05), and signiﬁcantly different pairwise contrasts
(Tukey’s HSD) are indicated by different lowercase letters.

ability into resource-rich soil patches, all of which are
important determinants of belowground resource capture
(Kembel et al. 2008; Hodge 2009). The lack of covariance
between SRL and leaf traits does not necessarily mean that
root and leaf function are uncoordinated. Given the meth-
odological problems with measuring SRL (Ryser 2006),
other metrics may be better indicators of root function.

ple, scale positively with leaf traits (Wahl & Ryser 2000;
Craine et al. 2001).
The third axis represented a gradient from tall plants that
ﬂower late in the growing season to short plants that ﬂower
early in the growing season. Pinus ponderosa is the tallest
species in the forest and suppresses understory diversity and
productivity (Laughlin et al. 2008). Tall herbs, such as Bahia
dissecta, require the full growing season to attain their maxi-
mum height, whereas species like Noccaea montana and An-
tennaria rosulata ﬂower early in the season and are short in
stature. Height was not completely independent of seed mass
because tall species generally had large seeds (Dı´az et al.
2004). The height axis was negatively correlated with leaf lit-
ter decomposition rate perhaps because tall species require
more structural material and may have higher leaf lignin
content (not measured in this study) than short species.
Plant functional types are important categories used by
ecologists to determine how plants respond to perturba-
tions and environmental gradients. Plant functional types
accounted for much less than half of the variance in each
of the major axes of specialization, and although the mean
values within types can differ from each other, there is
large overlap in trait ranges. Given this considerable over-
lap, we concur with Wright et al. (2004b), and urge cau-
tion when assigning mean trait values to plant functional
type
categories
in
vegetation
models.
Given
recent
advances in our ability to model continuous trait variation
among species (e.g., Garnier et al. 2004), future research
should evaluate how the functional composition of com-
munities, especially with respect to the leaf-height-seed
spectrums, inﬂuences ecosystem function.
Plant strategy axes are gradients of multiple correlated
traits (Craine 2009). However, leaf traits, seed mass, and
height at maturity appear to be fundamental and integrat-
ing properties of species that reﬂect much of the total varia-
tion in plant function, including root function (Westoby
1998; Westoby & Wright 2006). Though root morphology
could not adequately be predicted from leaf morphology,
root tissue chemistry aligned with the leaf economics spec-
trum (Wahl & Ryser 2000; Kembel et al. 2008). The leaf
and height axes can be used to predict leaf litter decomposi-
tion rate, indicating that plant strategies have important
consequences for ecosystem functioning.
