The Ecological Restoration Institute is dedicated to the restoration of fire-adapted forests and woodlands. ERI provides services that support the social and 
economic vitality of communities that depend on forests and the natural resources and ecosystem services they provide. Our efforts focus on science-based 
research of ecological and socio-economic issues related to restoration as well as support for on-the-ground treatments, outreach and education.

Changes in Forest Dynamics 15 Years After a Wildfire 
in a Mountainous Ecotone, Arizona, USA 
 
 
Introduction 
It is predicted that southwestern forests will undergo accelerated vegetation shifts due to changing 
disturbance patterns and climate. Wildfire and climate change effects on forest composition are most 
likely to be observed in transition zones, where species are near their environmental limits. In 2001, 
during one of the most extreme drought periods over the last few decades, the Leroux Fire in Arizona 
burned across a ponderosa pine-mixed conifer ecotone with variable severity. This fire provided a ra-
re opportunity to assess wildfire–drought interactions on forest structure. We re-measured sample 
plots established prior to (2000) the Leroux Fire and used monitoring data to examine stand dynamics 
and tree regeneration over the 15 years post-fire. Our objective was to investigate climate–disturbance
-related changes in forest structure and to test the importance of burn severity on these responses.  
Research Findings 
 Results showed extensive secondary tree mortality 
(38–41 percent) between 2002 and 2016 that nearly 
equaled initial post-fire mortality in three of four fire 
burn-severity classes (low, moderate, high). 
 Overstory species composition in 2016 tended to shift 
toward drought and fire tolerant species composition, 
such as ponderosa pine. 
 Drought intolerant species such as aspen experienced 
disproportionately higher mortality (46–62 percent 
tree loss) than other species across all burn severities.  
 Climate summaries indicate that drought condition 
and higher than average temperature occurred over 
the study period. Average daily temperatures for the 
2001 to 2010 decade were the highest on record since 
1900.   
 Ponderosa pine was the most drought tolerant species 
on the site. However, it too experienced mortality (34 
percent tree loss between 2002 and 2016) and was 
likely affected by exceptionally warm and dry condi-
tions.  
 Tree regeneration in 2016 occurred on <38 percent of 
the plots and mainly included aspen sprouts. By 2016, 
however, aspen densities were lower than pre-fire ob-
servations in all severity classes except low-burn se-
verity. Ponderosa pine regeneration was observed in 
only one unburned plot in 2016.

Conclusions 
 
The 2001 Leroux Fire burned mainly as low (52 percent) to moderate severity (29 percent). The fire 
resulted in decreases in tree density and basal area, which is due to both substantial initial and sec-
ondary tree morality. By 2016, 15 years after the fire, overstory composition tended to shift toward 
drought and fire tolerant species. High mortality (>65 percent) of limber pine and Douglas-fir, along 
with minimal regeneration of these species, suggests either a long period of recovery to mixed-
conifer forest or a type change. Variable aspen regeneration and sparse conifer regeneration led to 
non-forested openings and isolated aspen stands. The Leroux Fire provided an example of post-fire 
forest community changes likely driven by higher than average temperature and drought. Results 
from our study demonstrate wildfire and climate change interactions that may accelerate shifts in 
structure and composition within the ponderosa pine–mixed conifer ecotone.
