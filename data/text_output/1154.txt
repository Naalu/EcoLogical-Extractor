Prior research suggests that Indigenous fire management buffers climate influences on wildfires, but it is unclear
whether these benefits accrue across geographic scales. We use a network of 4824 fire-scarred trees in South-
west United States dry forests to analyze up to 400 years of fire-climate relationships at local, landscape, and
regional scales for traditional territories of three different Indigenous cultures. Comparison of fire-year and prior
climate conditions for periods of intensive cultural use and less-intensive use indicates that Indigenous fire man-
agement weakened fire-climate relationships at local and landscape scales. This effect did not scale up across
the entire region because land use was spatially and temporally heterogeneous at that scale. Restoring or em-
ulating Indigenous fire practices could buffer climate impacts at local scales but would need to be repeatedly
implemented at broad scales for broader regional benefits.

INTRODUCTION
Fire is a fundamental ecological process with impacts across geo-
graphic scales from ecosystems (1) to the Earth system (2). In
recent decades, wildfires across the globe have stressed human soci-
eties and infrastructure and driven biome transformations often re-
sulting in reduced ecosystem services including carbon storage (3),
runoff control (4), and biodiversity (5). This is the result of a century
of land-use changes, including active fire suppression and acceler-
ating climate changes. By contrast, Indigenous people coexisted
with wildfire for centuries or millennia before Euro-American col-
onization (6). Improved understanding of Indigenous fire histories
may support growing calls for integration of traditional and modern
fire management practices wherever and whenever possible (7).
Paleoecological, neo-ecological, and anthropological research
indicates that in at least some contexts, Indigenous fire management
includes benefits to biodiversity (8, 9), weakening of climate linkag-
es with fire activity (e.g., the importance of climate effects on fuel
types, accumulation, and moisture content) (10, 11), and reductions
in fire intensity (12). These studies have tended to focus on local- to
landscape-scale impacts of traditional fire management. However,
the geographic and temporal scales of human activities are variable
and heterogeneous (13). Some paleoecological studies have
suggested that climate, not cultural burning, was the key driver of
fire activity at regional to continental scales (14, 15) and that Indig-
enous influences on fire were ephemeral in particular areas (16, 17).
An assessment of cross-scale impacts of Indigenous fire manage-
ment on fire-climate relationships would assist contemporary fire
policy and management strategies by benchmarking our expecta-
tions of supporting cultural burning by Indigenous practitioners
or increasing anthropogenic (prescribed and deliberate) burning
in general. We use the term “fire-climate relationships” to describe
the mechanistic way by which properties of interannual climate in-
fluence fuel production and fuel aridity. We assess the strength of
these relationships by testing for statistically significant patterns in
interannual hydroclimate relative to tree-ring dated fire years across
periods of varying Indigenous cultural influence.
Here, we use a network of 4824 fire-scarred trees in the South-
west United States (Arizona and New Mexico) to explore the pat-
terns of fire-climate relationships across geographic scales and
across traditional territories of three different Indigenous cultural
groups (Fig. 1). Dry conifer forests dominated by ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa) and related species in the Southwest United
States are one of the most sampled contexts for tree-ring–based
fire histories. Fire scars are created at the base of these thick-
barked trees when fire raises temperatures high enough to kill the
cambium on only part of the tree. After the damage, the tree heals
by growing new tissue from the margins of the damaged area, thus
enabling the annual dating of the fire damage via dendrochronolog-
ical examination (18). Regional syntheses of tree-ring climate and
fire history reconstructions of widespread fire years across the
Southwest (19), California (20), and the entire western United
States (11) indicate that fire activity in fuel-limited dry pine
forests was strongly driven by the broad-scale, regional controls of
hydroclimate, at least partially entrained by the El Niño Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) (21). Specifically, one to three wet years
before a dry fire year produced sufficient fuels for fire to spread
(prior wet) and cured them to burn (fire-year drought). Although

much recent attention has been drawn to the relationships between
drought, vapor pressure deficit, and area burned in the western
United States in recent decades (22, 23), interannual climate
drivers on fuel production are still evident in modern fire activity
in the Southwest (24).
Here, we test the prevailing hypothesis that Indigenous societies
had only local, ephemeral impacts on fire regimes and that these
impacts were undetectable at landscape and regional scales. Previ-
ous studies that focused on measures of fire frequency have strug-
gled to unambiguously identify Indigenous fire management in fire
history data (25, 26). We propose to test this by focusing on fire-
climate relationships across geographic scales and three cultural
landscapes (referred to as Navajo, Jemez, and Apachería). The
primary mechanism by which Indigenous land and fire manage-
ment could influence fire-climate dynamics is through impacts on
fuels, affecting fuel patchiness and heterogeneity (through
anthropogenic pyrodiversity) or fuel removal (via grazing). We
further test the hypothesis that Indigenous impacts on fire
regimes, when present, varied on the basis of cultural and economic
practices. Human activities impinge upon fire and fuelwood uses
and fuel removal. Specifically, large populations of settled farmers
(Jemez) might supplement the burn area but decrease burn patch
sizes (6, 11, 27), mobile pastoralists (Navajo) might reduce fire ac-
tivity by removing fuels via grazing (28–30), and mobile hunter-
gatherers (Apache) might have undetectable impacts because their
populations were smaller and dispersed across a wide area, thereby
affecting fuel loads the least (26, 31).
Cultural landscapes
The Southwest United States has a rich and complex Indigenous
cultural history. Native peoples of the Southwest maintain oral his-
tories and traditions that connect culture, language, animals,

people, plants, and other resources to home landscapes since time
immemorial. History, ethnography, and archaeology document
spatial and temporal variability in the timing, intensity, and charac-
ter of land use and settlement by different groups across the region.
Documentation of traditional fire knowledge and practices,
however, is largely incomplete due to the historical and ongoing
consequences of colonialism, hence the importance of long-term
archaeological and paleofire studies in collaboration with Indige-
nous descendent communities. We concentrate on three subregion-
al areas of the Southwest where distinct groups that have unique
languages, cultures, and economies define cultural landscape
study units. Three cultural landscapes (Navajo, Jemez, and Apache-
ría) were used to define the landscape scale of analysis and to serve
as units of observation to cluster tree-ring sites (table S1) for com-
parisons of local-scale records (Fig. 2). Historically or archaeologi-
cally defined periods of light and intensive Indigenous use are used
to define time periods for comparative analysis at local, landscape,
and regional scales.
Diné (Navajo) people have traditional homelands and contem-
porary reservations in the Four Corners area of northwestern New
Mexico, northeastern Arizona, southwest Colorado, and southeast
Utah (32). Historically, Diné lived in small, family-based commu-
nities organized around sheep pastoralism, hunting, gathering, gar-
dening, and domestic dwellings called hogans (33). Earliest
archaeological and historical evidence suggest that, by 1500 CE,
the center of hogan-building, pastoral Diné life, and culture was
in an area called the Dinetah in the Largo and Gobernador basins
of northwestern New Mexico. By the mid-1700s, the cultural center
for pastoral Diné populations shifted westward with increased use
of the Chuska and Lukachukai mountains, partially in response to
overhunting in the Dinetah and the abundance of large game and
good forage for domestic sheep in the forested mountains, among
other factors (34). Previous studies have suggested that Navajo pas-
toralism reduced fire activity in pine forests (28), although burning
practices may also have kept fires burning frequently in heavily trav-
eled areas (29). For our analysis, the Navajo landscape includes the
Defiance Plateau, Chuska, and Lukachukai Mountains, which have
394 fire-scarred tree samples from 62 sites (median area = 5 ha per
site, mean area = 9.0 ± 15.6 ha per site) across dry conifer forests
dominated by ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga men-
ziesii) with widespread fire years between 1520 and 1879 CE
(Fig. 2A) (29, 30).
Hemish (Jemez) people have lived in the region of the southwest-
ern Jemez Mountains since migrating to the area from an ancestral
homeland in southern Colorado (35). Hemish people were farmers
and hunters who were organized into dozens of pueblo villages
across the pine forests and woodlands on the south-facing mesas
of the Jemez Plateau. Archaeological and paleoecological evidence
indicates that at least some Hemish people were living, farming, and
burning in the area since 1100 CE (6). By the mid-17th century,
Hemish people were forced off the forested mesas by a Spanish co-
lonial policy of Congregación (27). In the wake of this active colo-
nialism and missionization, Hemish populations were reduced by
more than 85%. Previous studies indicated that Hemish fire man-
agement (ignitions and fuel use) resulted in a fire regime character-
ized by small fires and may have reduced fire-climate relationships
(6, 11). For our analysis, the Jemez landscape includes the area of
Hemish agricultural activity and greatest land-use intensity, in the
southwestern quarter of the Jemez Mountains, which has 456 fire-
scarred tree samples from 48 sites (median area = 1 ha per site, mean
area = 12.3 ± 35.3 ha per site) with widespread fire years between
1516 and 1896 CE (Fig. 2B) (6, 11, 36–38).
Ndée (Apache) people have traditional homelands stretching
from central Arizona across New Mexico and into Texas and
through southeast Arizona into northwest Mexico (39). Ndée are
generally grouped into loosely connected bands that varied in
their degree of reliance upon gardening and raiding (40). Western
Apaches and Chiricahua Apaches have overlapping homelands in
the western part of Ndée traditional territories (Fig. 2C) (41). In
Apachería, Ndée were mobile hunter-forager-gardeners who sea-
sonally lived in and used pine forests for hunting, gardening, and
wild plant management. Fire use in gathering, gardening, and
hunting is well documented among Western Apaches because
these practices persisted into the 20th century (42). Apaches were
often the subject of colonial military persecution from the
Spanish, Mexican, and American governments, which drove them
to be even more highly mobile and minimize evidence of their pres-
ence to reduce pursuit. We concentrate on two mountain ranges
(Chiricahua and Pinaleño Mountains) as areas of Apachería that
were important loci to Western Apaches (43) and Chiricahua
Apaches (44) and that remained at a distance from Euroamerican
settlement until after the establishment of the San Carlos and
Fort Apache Indian Reservations in the 1870s. Together, Chiricahua
and Pinaleño Mountains have 502 fire-scarred tree samples from 72
sites (median area = 100 ha per site, mean area = 83.9 ± 34.3 ha per
site) and widespread fires between 1573 and 1894 CE (45–50).
Here, we use archaeological and historical evidence to define
periods of (i) intensive land use and settlement when Indigenous
fire management would have been most pronounced and (ii)
periods with light, qualitatively different, or undetectable land use
when Indigenous fire management would have been least influen-
tial (Table 1). For the Navajo landscape, we identify a period of in-
tensive use by pastoral Diné people as they moved westward out of
the Dinetah area after 1760 CE (34). For the Jemez landscape, we
identify a period of intense use before Congregación and population
decline (i.e., before ca. 1650 CE) (27). In the sky island landscapes of
Apachería, Ndée land use likely varied on the basis of the intensity

of warfare (51). We identify periods of light use during heightened
warfare (51) when traditional cultural burning would have been
risky because it would have exposed the locations of Apache
bands, although fire may have been used to facilitate escape or
destroy forage for pursuing cavalry. By contrast, intensive-use
periods in Apachería occurred during peacetime when traditional
land-use and burning practices would have been less risky (51).
Ethnography suggests some common forms of burning in wild
plant management, hunting, and garden maintenance, as well as
potential religious and other cultural uses of fire across Diné,

Hemish, and Ndée groups despite different cultures, languages, and
economies (6, 42). We use the term “Indigenous fire management”
to include all land-use practices by Indigenous people that affect ig-
nitions, fuels, fire behavior, or fire spread, such as anthropogenic
burning and wood harvesting for various cultural purposes (6),
and pastoral land use (29). Discerning intentionality is a challenge
for archaeologists, and whether these practices were done to delib-
erately manipulate fire regimes cannot be known with certainty. The
importance here is that their net effect was to influence fuels, igni-
tions, and fire spread. In this way, the past century of grazing,
logging, and active fire suppression are all part of recent fire man-
agement, even if these activities were not explicitly part of policy or
performed to deliberately modify fire regimes (52). For all fire-
climate analyses, we only use fires that occurred after 1500 CE
and before 1900 CE to exclude periods of low sample depth due
to the fading record problem (before 1500 CE) and after the
impacts of widespread fire exclusion due to overgrazing, logging,
curtailment of Indigenous fire practices and confinement to reser-
vations, and fire suppression (after 1900 CE).
RESULTS
Across the entire Southwest U.S. dataset (N = 4824 trees and
N = 451 sites; table S1) and over the entire record from 1500 to
1900 CE, climate exerted strong controls on fire activity. Seasonal
climate was significantly wetter in 1 to 3 years before regional
fires (>10% trees scarred) and significantly warmer and drier
during the year of fires, corroborating previous observations
(Fig. 1, C to G) (11, 21). We call this the “canonical pattern”
wherein wet years before fires were important for producing abun-
dant and continuous fuels that would carry surface fires widely
during unusually warm and dry years. These patterns were
evident when using each of four different hydroclimate reconstruc-
tions and the temperature reconstruction, so we use the Palmer
Drought Severity Index (PDSI), which integrates temperature and
precipitation for our analyses. The canonical pattern is partly
driven by ocean-atmospheric phenomena that create global-scale
teleconnections, the epitome of broad-scale climate controls on
fire regimes (53).
Local sites were grouped by cultural landscape to examine vari-
ability in site-level fire-climate patterns across the three different
landscape contexts. At these small (ca. 5 to 100 ha) local scales,
climate drivers of fire were rarely significant during periods of in-
tensive cultural use but were more consistently significant at most
sites during periods of light use (Fig. 2, D to F). This pattern was
statistically significant at the P < 0.05 level for every landscape but
the Navajo area (Table 2 and tables S2 and S3). In the Navajo area,
sites with significant fire-climate relationships were more common
during the light-use period (72%) than the intensive-use period
(53%), but this difference was not significant at the P < 0.05 level.
In aggregate, while climate drove local fire activity at nearly all cul-
tural landscape sites during periods of light use (85.1% of all sites
across cultural landscapes), significant climate drivers were only ob-
served from a minority of sites during intensive cultural periods
(32.3% of all sites; Fisher’s exact test, P < 0.0001).
At the landscape scale (i.e., Navajo, Jemez, and Apachería study
units), fire-climate relations differed during periods of intensive and
light use, but not in the same ways as the local-scale patterns. In all
cultural landscapes, periods with light use displayed statistically sig-
nificant canonical wet-dry patterns (Fig. 3, B, E, and H). During in-
tensive-use periods, prior-year wet conditions were not a significant
driver of fire activity, but fire-year drought was, despite cultural,
economic, and population size variability among the three cultural
areas. This pattern of weakened prior wet conditions during inten-
sive-use periods occurred across all climate variables, even as signif-
icant fire-year drought and warm conditions persisted (figs. S1 to
S3). This suggests that the fire-year climate conditions that drove
widespread landscape-scale fire years were similar across intensive-
and light-use periods (Fig. 2, J to L) but that Indigenous fire man-
agement, by changing the timing of ignitions to periods of less
abundant fuels, reduced the significance of wet conditions and
fuel production before fire years.
The landscape-scale patterns are not unique features of the
climate during these periods because t test comparisons of PDSI
and ENSO across intensive- and light-use periods reveal no signifi-
cant differences for all cultural areas (Fig. 2, B to D and J to L). The
exception is at Jemez when examining ENSO (t = −2.6844,
df = 132.35, P = 0.008194) where Niño 3 conditions during the in-
tensive-use period were significantly cooler (−0.085 ± 0.848,
N = 151) than during the light-use period (−0.056 ± 0.869,
N = 250). The difference is slight and would actually suggest a
more common role for La Niña and drought than is evident
during the Jemez intensive-use period (Fig. 3, D and E).
Using cultural periods of intensive and light use to partition the
Southwest U.S. regional-scale dataset (all 4824 trees across the
region), every period demonstrated the canonical pattern of signifi-
cantly wetter climate in the 1 to 3 years before fire, and significant
drought during the fire year, regardless of the intensity of use
(Fig. 4). Therefore, the influence of Indigenous burning on fire-
climate relationships is undetectable at this scale. The dilution of
human influences results from variability in the timing and loca-
tions of the most intensive Indigenous fire management. Land
use was spatially heterogeneous because the resources that people

used and managed were not evenly distributed, generating consid-
erable spatial variability in human impacts on ignitions and fuels.
The intensive-use periods are different for the Navajo and Jemez
landscapes, and each of these only partially overlaps with the inten-
sive-use period in Apachería (Fig. 2 and Table 1). It follows that for
any given period, the regional-scale record is composed of a mix of
local sites with reduced climate influences and sites with significant
fire-climate relationships, but even during periods of intensive use
at a given cultural landscape, the number of local sites with muted
climate drivers was always lower as the geographic scale broadened.
DISCUSSION
Our work further indicates the lessons that can be learned from the
historical ecology of Indigenous burning practices over centuries or
longer, particularly in contexts like the Southwest United States that
have experienced centuries of colonial impacts on traditional eco-
logical knowledge and practices (27). The past is full of lessons for
contemporary society to coexist with wildfire (54–56). Integrations
of archaeology, history, dendrochronology, and paleoecology offer
unique opportunities to enrich our understanding of coupled
human-natural fire regimes and their consequences. As climate
change (57), land-use histories (12), and settlement patterns (58)
make human communities more vulnerable to fire, the past can

offer a spectrum of possibilities to reduce those vulnerabilities (6,
11, 20, 59, 60).
Fire-climate relationships across the western United States indi-
cate that interannual wet-dry switching exerted strong controls on
fire activity in dry pine forests for at least the past five centuries (11,
61). Our regional synthesis of the Southwest United States corrob-
orates these patterns. During all cultural time periods analyzed here,
regional-scale fire activity was preceded by 1 to 3 years of above
average moisture followed by significant drought during the year
of burning. This was also true of local- and landscape-scale fire
activity in periods when Indigenous land use, and presumably fire
management, was light. However, in all cultural areas, regardless of
differences in language, cultural practices, and economy, when In-
digenous occupation and land management was most pronounced,
fire-climate relationships were buffered at local and landscape
scales. Local burning was probably in small patches, reducing
surface fuel continuity but retaining unburned fuel capable of
burning in future fires (6, 10, 11, 62)—a classic feature of anthropo-
genic pyrodiversity (62). Previous research has observed that fires
were more frequent during Hemish fire management, but fewer
trees were scarred during fires (Fig. 3F) and fewer sites recorded
fires (Fig. 2H) than during light-use periods (6, 11, 27). This indi-
cates frequent but relatively small, patchy fires during intensive land
use. A similar pattern may be evident in the Navajo dataset (Figs. 2G
and 3C), whereas Apache wartime (light use) fires have been ob-
served to be synchronous and widespread (51, 63). Light grazing
—predominantly on the Navajo landscape—may have had a
similar effect as Hemish patch burning on the heterogeneity of land-
scape fuel loads, although more intensive grazing would have sub-
stantially reduced fire spread (28, 30).
At the landscape scale, drought remained a potent driver of fire
activity even during intensive use, suggesting that even in heteroge-
neous fuelscapes created by Indigenous patch burning, climate
could overcome limitations in fuel continuity and promote spread-
ing fires. These observations corroborate prior research that Indig-
enous patch burning can buffer—but not entirely eliminate—local-
to landscape-scale climate influences on widespread fire activity
(10). We show that this effect is scale dependent. Locally, the buf-
fering of climate influences was strongest. At the landscape scale,
climate impacts were moderated, but drought persisted as an impor-
tant influence on fire activity. At the regional scale, the canonical
climate pattern continued to be the primary driver of fire activity
through time. The repetition of this cross-scale variation in fire-
climate drivers across all cultural regions and periods hints at a
common cause—human impacts on fire regimes were scale depen-
dent, in space and time (13). This scale dependency means that pa-
leofire records composited and assessed at regional scales can mask
important, localized Indigenous influences on fire activity and the
ecological and social influences of this management (13).
This study highlights both the lacuna of our knowledge about
Indigenous fire management practices in the western United
States and the benefits of collaborative research between archaeolo-
gists, paleoecologists, and Indigenous communities and scientists
(54, 56). Colonialism by Euro-Americans has affected access to tra-
ditional lands and, in many cases, traditional fire practices of Indig-
enous people around the world (64). Working together, scientists
and Indigenous communities can develop new approaches to recon-
struct traditional practices and document the ecological effects of
Indigenous practices (64).
These results also have implications for modern fire manage-
ment and policy. In the wake of recent wildfire disasters—fires
that damages homes, infrastructure, water sources, and kill
humans—there have been calls to restore traditional Indigenous
burning practices in western North America (7, 65) and elsewhere
(66). Indigenous-managed pyrodiversity offers the opportunity to
reduce fire hazard (6), support fire-sensitive plant and animal
species (8), reduce carbon emissions (67), and empower Indigenous
people (7, 65, 68). Our results show that a further benefit of support-
ing, restoring, or emulating Indigenous burning practices, including

modern prescribed burning efforts, would be the buffering of the
impact of increasing fuel aridity on fire activity. To achieve land-
scape and regional scale fire-climate buffering, however, these
applied burning practices would need to be conducted often and
at the scales of interest or in strategic locations that have particularly
important influence on landscape-scale fire behavior (69). Land
managers have struggled to accomplish this goal (70), but future
management aims for increasing prescribed burning by more
than an order of magnitude (56, 71). As was the case in recent cen-
turies, climate will continue to play a strong role in influencing fire
activity even in the best-case management scenarios. However, In-
digenous burning, prescribed burning, and managed wildfire at the
appropriate scales (7, 65) can all contribute to undermine climate as
a “force multiplier” in our wildfire challenges as we endeavor to get
more “good fire” on the ground (22, 72).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All fire-scar chronologies used in the analysis are archived in the
International Multiproxy Paleofire Database (IMPD) and were
compiled as part of the North American Fire Scar Network
(NAFSN) (73, 74). All Superposed Epoch Analyses (SEAs) were
conducted using the burnr (75) library [function sea()] in the R pro-
gramming environment (76). SEA isolates the climate reconstruc-
tion values for each fire event year (lag 0), and prior (lags −1 to −4)
and posterior years (lags 1 and 2), calculates mean values for these
lag years for all fire events in a particular period, and then assesses
their statistical significance against bootstrapped resampling of a
random set of “event” years of the same sample size from the
entire dataset. In this fashion, SEA reveals the statistically significant
patterns of prior-year and fire-year climate for any single temporal
or spatial domain. At each spatial scale and for time periods ana-
lyzed, we used SEA (21, 75) of fire years and four reconstructions
of hydroclimate: (i) summer PDSI (77), (ii) standardized winter
precipitation anomalies (78), (iii) standardized summer precipita-
tion anomalies (78), and (iv) the Niño 3 index of ENSO (79), as
well as regional temperature anomalies (80), to analyze fire-
climate relationships. Interpolated drought and seasonal precipita-
tion were delimited to the geographic extent of the landscape
defined by the extent of tree-ring sample locations.
Fire-scar chronologies were aggregated from individual tree-ring
sites for landscape- and regional-scale collections of individual tree
records. Individual fire scar sites (i.e., the local scale) were over-
whelmingly, but not exclusively, small (mean area = 48 ± 247.1
ha, median area = 3.5 ha), representing individual tree stands to
patches of forest. Local, landscape, and regional groupings were fil-
tered to isolate all presuppression fire years (1500 to 1900 CE), and
archaeological and historical records (27, 34, 51) were used to define
intensive- and light-use periods for the Hemish, Diné, and Ndée
(Table 1). The composite record for analyses at the regional scale
included 4824 individual trees for 451 sites in Arizona and New
Mexico (table S1). Landscape-scale datasets had between 48 and
72 sites and 394 and 502 trees for each cultural landscape (Table 2).
For the local-scale analyses, the tree-ring site was the fundamen-
tal unit of analysis and observation, but sites were grouped by cul-
tural landscape for comparison and aggregate analysis. For sites, all
fire years were analyzed with SEA using the PDSI paleoclimate
dataset (77) for intensive- and light-use periods. The presence/
absence of statistically significant departures from average climate
conditions was classified into three categories: (i) one to three
prior years of above average moisture, (ii) above average drought
in the fire year, or (iii) canonical wet-dry switching. These three
types of fire-climate relationship were then tallied for all sites that
had at least five trees, had at least five fires, and had undergone rig-
orous quality control to reduce the impact of misdated fire years for
the cultural period of interest (tables S2 and S3). Sites were grouped
by landscape-scale cultural areas (Navajo, Jemez, and Apachería; see
Figs. 1 and 2), and the number of sites with and without significant
climate relationships was summed for each cultural period for four-
cell Fisher’s exact tests for each landscape to determine whether
fire-climate relationships were significantly more common in
light-use periods than in intensive-use periods at P < 0.05. We cal-
culated percentages of sites with significant climate drivers for each
period and each landscape using these tallies. Table 2 reports the
percentage (and number) of sites with statistically significant
climate drivers for the intensive- and light-use periods, and the
Fisher’s exact test results for that landscape. Tables S2 and S3
present the tallies for sites/periods with or without significant
climate drivers used in the Fisher’s exact tests.
At the landscape and regional scales, trees were the fundamental
unit of measure. For analysis, these were aggregated by cultural
landscape (for the landscape-scale) or the entire region (regional
scale). For landscape and regional analysis, widespread fire years
were those years represented by at least 10% of recording trees
scarred within the entire landscape when a minimum of 11 record-
ing trees were present in the aggregate record. A recording tree is
one that was scarred that year or had been previously scarred.
Thus, a fire year at the landscape and regional scales refers to fires
at a larger spatial extent than that represented in local-scale fires.
SEA was done for each cultural period for landscape- and region-
al-scale aggregations to identify the presence/absence of signifi-
cantly wet years before widespread fire events and significantly
dry fire years. SEA with all climate variables can be found in figs.
