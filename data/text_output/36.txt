ABSTRACT: Intensive thinning prescriptions intended to restore historic forest structure have produced
heavy broadcast slash fuel loads in northwestern Arizona, sometimes leading to high tree mortality
following prescribed burning. Mechanical slash compression with a D-6 bulldozer to reduce the severity of
fire effects on residual trees was evaluated. Ten of 42 measured trees (24%) died within 2 years after
burning of broadcast slash, and crown scorch of trees without slash compression treatment averaged 26%.
In contrast, no trees died after burning of compressed slash and crown scorch averaged 3%, even though
the total fuel loading was indistinguishable from the broadcast slash treatment. The practice of raking fuels
away from the boles of old-growth trees also contributed to reduced scorch as compared to younger,
unraked trees. Slash compression is a viable method of reducing mortality, offering ecological and
economical tradeoffs. Benefits include the ability to reduce large quantities of slash, safeguarding old-
growth tree survival while rapidly achieving open forest structure. Costs include paying for equipment
operation as well as the possibility of damage to soils or plants. West. J. Appl. For. 19(3):149–153.

Thinning and prescribed burning are widely advocated to
reduce hazardous fuels and restore historic forest conditions
in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests (Lynch et al.
2000, Covington 2000). Even when large trees are prefer-
entially retained, thinning residues substantially increase
woody fuel loadings (Fule´ et al. 2002a). There are tradeoffs
among the common methods of slash disposal. Slash re-
moval takes foliar nutrients off site and is not economically
feasible in remote areas of the Southwest. Piling concen-
trates fuels in pile locations, reducing the general level of
heat and increasing the window of safety for prescribed
burning. Piles are often burned under snow in the winter.
However, soils are severely heated under piles, facilitating
establishment of exotic plants (Korb 2001). Machinery used
for piling can scrape and compact soils and damage under-
story plants. Broadcast slash burning retains nutrient-rich
ash on the site and disperses soil heating. However, burning
of broadcast slash can result in excessive mortality of re-
sidual trees because of high fire intensities caused by “red”
slash fuels (dried needles or leaves).
Crown scorch and bole char are among the leading
causes of long-term mortality in ponderosa pine (Wyant et
al. 1986, Ryan 1982). Orozco and Carrillo (1993) found that
burning red slash during periods when heavy fuels were
saturated and duff was moist reduced fire intensities by
limiting fuel consumption to 1- and 10-hour fuels. This in
turn reduced crown scorch and prevented cambial and root
damage resulting from deep smoldering fire. Dormant sea-
son burns have also been found to greatly reduce mortality
even if large percentages of individual crowns are scorched
(Harrington 1987).
A landscape-scale forest restoration project was imple-
mented at Mt. Trumbull, in northwestern Arizona, begin-
ning in 1995 (Moore et al. 1999). The Bureau of Land
Management, in cooperation with Northern Arizona Uni-
versity and the Arizona Game and Fish Department, has
carried out thinning followed by prescribed burning. Burns
were conducted during the dormant season and fuels were

raked away from the boles of all of the old-growth trees to
prevent cambial girdling (Sackett et al. 1996) but several
fires still resulted in unacceptable levels of mortality, pri-
marily due to crown consumption and/or scorch. In this
study, we tested a slash compression treatment using a
bulldozer to reduce mortality from prescribed burns. We
hypothesized that slash compression would reduce flame
lengths and fire intensity, thereby reducing prescribed fire
mortality caused by crown scorch.
Methods
The study site is located near Mt. Trumbull on the
Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) Arizona Strip Dis-
trict, within the Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monu-
ment (lat. 36°22 N, lon. 113°7 W). Dominant trees were
ponderosa pine and Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), with
scattered pinyon pine (Pinus edulis), New Mexican locust
(Robinia neomexicana), Utah juniper (Juniperous os-
teosperma), and numerous shrub species. Soils are derived
from volcanic parent materials. Annual precipitation aver-
ages 50.5 cm and occurs primarily in the winter as snow and
during the summer monsoon from Jul. to Sept. Prior to
European settlement in 1870, surface fires were common,
with a mean interval of 5 to 7 years, similar to most other
southwestern ponderosa forests (Moore et al. 1999).
Control (standard burning of broadcast slash) and slash
compression treatment areas, approximately 4 ha each, were
selected in a thinned stand. Slope averaged 13% in the
control and 18% in the treatment areas. All old-growth
(pre-1870) ponderosa pine trees were retained. In addition,
approximately three younger (post-1870) trees were re-
tained within a 9- to 18-m radius of each snag or stump that
provided evidence of a dead pre-1870 tree. The purpose of
this thinning prescription was to provide a close match in
forest density and spatial pattern to the structure that was
present before fire exclusion (Covington et al. 1997, Fule´ et
al. 2001). Species other than ponderosa pine were not
thinned. Prior to thinning, the stand averaged 880 trees/ha
with basal area 30.1 m2ha. Ponderosa pine made up 84% of
basal area, Gambel oak made up 13%, and pinyon and
juniper comprised the remainder. Stand structure has not yet
been remeasured following treatment. However, similar
treatments in an adjacent stand reduced forest density by
67% and basal area by 47% (Waltz et al. 2003).
Commercial thinning of merchantable timber had been
conducted in the slash treatment and control areas in
1998–1999, leaving broadcast slash. After the commercial
thin, excess submerchantable trees, 25 cm diameter at
breast height (dbh), were felled, lopped and scattered as
slash. Forest floor material was raked approximately 0.5 to
1 m away from the boles of all old-growth trees in both
treatment areas to protect old trees from cambial girdling
(Sackett et al. 1996). The purpose of the raking was to
remove the bulk of fuels that could create severe heat due to
smoldering combustion, but the raked areas were not
cleared to mineral soil.
We selected individual ponderosa pine trees (focal trees)
to serve as plot centers for fuel load estimates prior to
broadcast burning. Focal trees were divided into two cate-
gories, old-growth trees (pre-1870, the time of European
settlement and fire exclusion) and post-1870 trees. Old-
growth trees were defined as mature ponderosa pines with
characteristic yellow bark and rounded crowns (Figure 1).
All the old-growth trees in each of the treatment and control
areas were selected as focal trees (N  22 in the slash
compression treatment and N  19 in the control). Because
the density of the younger, post-1870 trees was higher than
the density of old-growth trees, younger trees (N  20) were
selected in each of the treatment and control areas by
randomly choosing 20% of the post-1870 trees.
With the focal tree serving as plot center, three 6.1-m
fuel transects were extended from the base of the tree along
the 0°, 120°, and 240° azimuths. Fuel loads were measured
using planar transects (Brown 1974) with coefficients de-
veloped for southwestern ponderosa pine (Sackett 1980).
Fuels were tallied according to established time lags re-
quired to change the moisture content of the fuel (Brown
1974). Fuels were classified as1-hour (0–0.6 cm diameter),
10-hour (0.7–2.5 cm diameter), 100-hour (2.6–7.6 cm di-
ameter) and 1,000-hour (7.6 cm diameter). Within each

transect, 1-hour, 10-hour, and 100-hour fuels were tallied
within alternate 0.61-m increments. The purpose of the
alternating tally increments was to capture fuel loads at
different distances from the focal tree boles. One-thousand-
hour fuels were tallied along the entire transect. Slash
depths and forest floor depths were measured at 0.3, 1.5,
4.6, and 6.1 m along each transect. Slope, aspect, total
height, ground to live crown height, crown radius, and dbh
were recorded for each focal tree.
In the slash compression treatment, a D-6 bulldozer was
driven over the cured slash to break down the vertical
arrangement. Each unit area of the forest floor where slash
was present was driven over approximately once, except
where it was necessary to backup to maneuver the bulldozer
between the trees. We did not remeasure fuels after com-
pression, because the planar transect method is designed to
measure woody fuels laying on or above the forest floor
(Brown 1974). The compaction of fuels by the bulldozer,
pushing some woody material into the forest floor, would
have lead to a false impression of reduced fuels if measured
by a planar transect, when in fact none of the fuels were
removed. By measuring fuels after thinning and raking but
before slash compression, we were able to assess whether
fuel loads were similar in control and treatment areas.
Burning was carried out on Apr. 3, 2000, with a combi-
nation of backing fire and short (3–4.5 m) strip headfires.
Both treatments were categorized as fire behavior fuel
model 11 (light logging slash). The temperature ranged
from 15–21 °C. Relative humidity ranged from 23 to 28%.
Winds were 0–6 km/hr from the west. Average flame
lengths were 0.6 m in the slash compression treatment,
0.6 m in the broadcast slash. Average maximum flame
lengths were 1.1 m in the slash compression treatment and
1.3 m in the broadcast slash. Different observers in each
treatment area measured the flame lengths.
Focal trees were remeasured during the summer of 2001
and again in the winter of 2002. Tree condition—live,
declining, or dead—was observed. Bole char heights, crown
scorch heights, and the volume of crown scorch were also
measured.
Since the focal trees were located within geographically
distinct treatment areas, the treatments could not be ran-
domly assigned and the trees are pseudoreplicates rather
than independent experimental units (Hurlbert 1984). This
is a common issue in fire studies, because experimental
creation of small interspersed plots of different burning
treatments is often logistically impossible (van Mantgem et
al. 2001), so cause-and-effect relationships cannot be in-
ferred in a statistical sense. However, within the constraints
of this study we carefully matched trees and sites and
measured variables with clear causal links: preburning fuels
and postburning scorch, char, and mortality.
Variables were tested for conformity with analysis of
variance (ANOVA) assumptions and were square-root or
natural-log transformed where necessary. Results were
compared with two-way ANOVA tests on treatment and
tree category (  0.05). Multivariate ANOVA was used
for the suite of intercorrelated woody fuel variables.
Tukey’s posthoc tests were then conducted to compare
treatments separately on old-growth and post-1870 trees.
Results
Before burning, tree diameter and total height measure-
ments were not significantly different between treatment
sites before burning, although pre-1870 trees were signifi-
cantly larger than the younger trees (Table 1). However, the
ground-to-live-crown distances were indistinguishable be-
tween treatments and tree categories. Lighter woody fuels (1
to 100 h) were relatively similar across treatments and tree
categories, except that the 10-hour fuels were significantly
heavier below post-1870 trees in both treatments. Woody
fuel loading was highest in the largest size class (1,000 h)
and ranged from 34% to 70% higher under post-1870 trees
than pre-1870 trees. Average forest floor depths did not
differ by treatment or tree category, but slash depths were
greater under post-1870 trees (Table 1).
The broadcast burn resulted in high mortality, with 24%
of all focal trees dying by the winter of 2002 (Table 2).
Mortality by tree category in the broadcast burn was 14%
for old-growth trees (3 of 22) and 35% for post-1870 trees
(7 of 20). In contrast, no trees died in the slash compression
treatment in the first two growing seasons following burn-
ing (Table 2).
The weighted average of crown volume scorched in the
broadcast burn was 25.7%, with significantly higher scorch

(38.6%) in post-1870 trees (Table 2). In contrast, the aver-
age crown volume scorched was 3% in the slash com-
pression treatment. Maximum scorch heights exceeded 9 m
in the broadcast burn and averaged 3.1 m on post-1870
trees, as opposed to maximum heights of 3.1 m in the
compression treatment and average values of 0.5 m. Max-
imum bole char was not significantly different among treat-
ments (Table 2).
Discussion
Fuel loads and tree characteristics were essentially the
same in both treatment and control areas after the thinning
and fuel raking activities were completed, but the slash
compression treatment was associated with a major reduc-
tion in fire severity: broadcast slash burning resulted in
25% tree mortality, in striking contrast to zero mortality in
the slash compression treatment. Trees in the broadcast burn
also had greater scorch heights and volume of scorched
canopy.
The difference in fire effects suggests that fire-caused
mortality may be influenced more by the vertical arrange-
ment of the uncompacted slash than simply by gross fuel
quantity. A simple mechanism would be that higher fire
intensity in well-aerated cured fine fuels could have facili-
tated convection into the canopies of residual trees, resulting
in high crown scorch. When vertical fuel arrangement was
decreased in the slash compaction treatment, crown scorch
was greatly reduced. However, although fire effects differed
greatly between the two areas, fire line observers recorded
identical flame length measurements. Since crown scorch is
directly related to flame length (Agee 1993), the discrep-
ancy between visual estimates and postfire scorch measure-
ments indicates that periodic observations of flame length
may be inadequate to develop a meaningful assessment of
fire behavior. The fact that two different observers recorded
data on the two study areas may have contributed to
inconsistency.
In northern Arizona, the recommendation to rake fuels
away from the boles of old-growth ponderosa pine trees
arose in response to high mortality from cambial girdling at
the Chimney Spring Interval Burning study site in northern
Arizona (Sackett et al. 1996). Sackett et al. (1996) and
Covington et al. (1997) found that cambial temperatures
measured with thermocouples remained below lethal levels
when fuels were raked away. In contrast, Swezy and Agee
(1991) suggested that raking might harm vulnerable shallow
roots by piling additional fuels on the rooting zone. In the
present study, where raking occurred around old-growth
trees in both the broadcast burn and the slash compression
treatments, woody fuel and forest floor depths tended to be
lower under the pre-1870 trees (Table 1). No old-growth
trees died after the slash compression, and the old-growth
mortality was only 40% that of younger trees in the broad-
cast burn. These results suggest that old trees received some
benefit from raking, although 14% still died in the broadcast
burn. Longer term data were presented by Kolb et al.
(2001), indicating that no old-growth trees died as a result of
prescribed burning in a study near Chimney Spring, AZ,
when fuels were removed.
Managers should be aware, however, that tree mortality
following burning is not a simple issue. High mortality was
encountered after burning raked old-growth trees on shal-
low lava soils at Mt. Trumbull (Fule´ et al. 2002b), while
relatively low mortality occurred after burning unraked old-
growth trees on limestone soils at Grand Canyon National
Park (Kaufmann and Covington 2001).
Mechanical slash compression is a viable slash treatment
for most high-intensity forest thinning operations in the
Southwest. It will increase the total cost of the treatments by
adding the cost of machine and operator time. There may be
some undesirable ecological effects associated with equip-
ment operation, such as additional soil disturbance (Korb et
al. in press). These effects were not addressed in our study,
although no increase in exotic species on the slash compres-
sion site was noted (P.Z. Fule´, personal observation, 2002).
Weighed against these costs, however, is the fact that many
forest restoration projects are explicitly aimed at conserving
rare ecological elements such as old-growth trees. In these
circumstances, slash compression may be a relatively eco-
nomical alternative, especially as compared to more-inten-
sive methods such as piling or complete removal.
Managers may choose to carry out intensive, single-entry
forest restoration treatments because they can rapidly re-
duce fuel hazards (Fule´ et al. 2001) and restore herbaceous
production (Covington et al. 1997), tree growth (Feeney
et al. 1998), and other desirable stand characteristics. A
negative consequence of rapid treatment is the increase in
short-term fuel loading, much of it loosely arranged volatile
red slash, increasing the potential for severe fire effects.

Slash treatment alternatives such as mechanical compres-
sion will become more important to land managers because
of the intensifying push to improve forest health and reduce
fire hazard on larger and larger acreages of western lands
over short periods of time.
