Abstract.
Forest landscapes across western North America (wNA) have experienced exten-
sive changes over the last two centuries, while climatic warming has become a global reality
over the last four decades. Resulting interactions between historical increases in forested area
and density and recent rapid warming, increasing insect mortality, and wildfire burned areas,
are now leading to substantial abrupt landscape alterations. These outcomes are forcing forest
planners and managers to identify strategies that can modify future outcomes that are ecologi-
cally and/or socially undesirable. Past forest management, including widespread harvest of
fire- and climate-tolerant large old trees and old forests, fire exclusion (both Indigenous and
lightning ignitions), and highly effective wildfire suppression have contributed to the current
state of wNA forests. These practices were successful at meeting short-term demands, but they
match poorly to modern realities. Hagmann et al. review a century of observations and multi-
scale, multi-proxy, research evidence that details widespread changes in forested landscapes
and wildfire regimes since the influx of European colonists. Over the preceding 10 millennia,
large areas of wNA were already settled and proactively managed with intentional burning by
Indigenous tribes. Prichard et al. then review the research on management practices histori-
cally applied by Indigenous tribes and currently applied by some managers to intentionally
manage forests for resilient conditions. They address 10 questions surrounding the application
and relevance of these management practices. Here, we highlight the main findings of both
papers and offer recommendations for management. We discuss progress paralysis that often
occurs with strict adherence to the precautionary principle; offer insights for dealing with the
common problem of irreducible uncertainty and suggestions for reframing management and
policy direction; and identify key knowledge gaps and research needs.

INTRODUCTION
Western forests are rapidly changing
Starting in the mid-1980s, area burned in seasonally
dry forests of western North America (wNA) began a
steady rise (Westerling et al. 2006), despite increasing
investment in fire suppression (Calkin et al. 2005). Sea-
sonally dry forests are those pine, dry or moist mixed-
conifer, and cold forests that are available to burn most
years during the wildfire season (refer to forest type defi-
nitions
and
discussion
in
Hessburg
et al.
2019).
Increased burned area is attributed to combinations of
warmer seasonal temperatures, longer wildfire seasons,
drier summers, below-average winter precipitation and
earlier
snowmelt,
and
increasing
human
ignitions
(Westerling et al. 2006, Morgan et al. 2008). The inci-
dence of large wildfires has likewise increased across
wNA over the last three decades (Schoennagel et al.
2017, Parks and Abatzoglou 2020), while burned area in
the Inland Northwest and American Southwest has risen
most noticeably over the last two decades (Westerling
2016). These increases are occurring not only in dry pine
and mixed-conifer forests, but also in moist and cold

forests, and in nearby nonforest vegetation (preforest,
grassland, shrubland, and sparse woodland; Parks et al.
2015). Based on climate change predictions, burned area
in wNA will at least double or triple by mid-century
(McKenzie et al. 2004, Westerling et al. 2011).
While increase in burned area is strongly associated
with climatic warming, changes to other aspects of wild-
fire regimes (Table 1) more directly reflect the influence
of human activities. For example, in many wNA forests,
land and resource management decisions and actions led
to abrupt and persistent declines in fire frequency (and
hence, burned area) beginning more than 170 yr ago.
Decreased fire frequency led to increased continuity and
accumulation of live and dead fuels (Stephens et al.
2009), both of which contribute to increases in fire sever-
ity as burned area increases (Parks and Abatzoglou
2020). Likewise, while human-caused ignitions continue
to contribute to increasing burned area (Balch et al.
2017), they also reflect contemporary land development
and access patterns. With ongoing fire suppression,
lengthening wildfire seasons, and the increased likeli-
hood of extreme fire weather, fire effects are broadly
becoming more severe than those experienced in the last
two centuries (North et al. 2015, Parks and Abatzoglou
2020). As a result, forests developing after large contem-
poraneous wildfires little resemble forests evolving under
a more characteristic wildfire regime (Keane et al. 2002,
Hessburg et al. 2005, Coop et al. 2020).
The challenge of larger and more intense wildfires
The increasing impacts that large and intense wildfires
will have on social and ecological systems will be the
major challenge facing managers of seasonally dry for-
ests over the 21st-century. Prolonged smoke production
and human health effects, chronic soil erosion and mass
wasting, degraded water supplies, loss of cultural and
natural resources, increased greenhouse gas emissions
and reduced carbon storage are all growing issues (Spies
et al. 2014). Management capacity to influence how
much area burns will be somewhat limited (cf. Taylor
et al. 2016), but fuel reduction treatments, including pre-
scribed burning, coupled forest thinning and prescribed
burning, and managed wildfires, are proven methods to
influence the ecological impacts of wildfire, and mitigate
impacts of extreme fire events on social systems (Taylor
et al. 2016; Prichard et al. 2021). To date, mechanical
fuel reduction treatments have been applied to small
portions of wNA forested landscapes (Barnett et al.
2016, Vaillant and Reinhardt 2017, Kolden 2019, Kolden
and Henson 2019). One reason is that land allocations
amenable to mechanical treatments (via their enabling
legislation) represent a dwindling fraction of public
lands (Fig. 1); another is a lack of sufficient experience
with prescribed burning and managing wildfires in front
or backcountry locations. However, scaling-up a broad
variety of fuel reduction treatments can tip landscape
dynamics in favor of more benign fire behavior and
effects (Stevens et al. 2014, Parks et al. 2016, Taylor
et al. 2016, Ager et al. 2020).
The assertion of regional-scale adaptation needs
The need for broad-scale climate and wildfire adapta-
tion across wNA is predicated on two main assertions.
The first is that most seasonally dry forest landscapes,
and some drier coastal forests (Hessburg et al. 2019),
have significantly changed over at least the last two cen-
turies under the influences of curtailed Indigenous burn-
ing before 1850 (Kay 2000, Stewart 2002); wildfire
exclusion (beginning with domestic livestock grazing in
the mid-1850s, Belsky and Blumenthal 1997); and dec-
ades of selection cutting of large, old, early seral tree spe-
cies (Hessburg and Agee 2003, Lydersen et al. 2013). The
resultant stand- to landscape-scale changes in forest
structures and fuels have left these seasonally dry forests
vulnerable to the direct and indirect effects of climate
warming, drought, and wildfire (Allen et al. 2002, Noss
et al. 2006, Keane et al. 2018, Bryant et al. 2019, Hess-
burg et al. 2019). The second assertion is that climate
change and wildfire adaptation treatments implemented
at large regional landscape scales can effectively moder-
ate many ecosystem transitions, conserve greater area
and heterogeneity of forest successional conditions (Mor-
itz et al. 2013, Coop et al. 2020), better foster native bio-
diversity (Raphael et al. 2001, Bisson et al. 2003, Isaak
et al. 2010, Rieman et al. 2010), and maintain essential
and desirable ecosystem services and processes (e.g., see
Dale et al. 2001, Millar et al. 2007, Hurteau et al. 2014).

forestlands often devolves into value-laden discussions
and politicized views of appropriate contexts and frames
of reference (Peery et al. 2019). Here, we define inten-
tional management as the planned application of silvi-
cultural and prescribed fire treatments and managed
wildfire to meet a variety of specific landscape-level
objectives in predefined conditions and contexts. This
can include opportunities in Indigenous communities
for more decentralized stewardship practices related to
resource tending, subsistence activities, and spiritual or

religious observances (Norgaard 2014). In contrast,
under passive management (i.e., continued fire suppres-
sion with little intentional forest or fuel management),
many assume that existing conditions and processes will
naturally sort out an effective remedy without benefit of
intentional management (Carey 2006).
Owing to extensive 20th-century harvest of large trees
and old-growth forests, public trust in forest manage-
ment eroded. In response, an emphasis emerged to con-
serve the victims of that history, large trees and old
forests, and native species and their habitats, by minimiz-
ing further forest management actions. This emphasis is
commonly underscored with policies that emphasize
riparian and terrestrial habitat reserves and related con-
servation areas (Spies et al. 2019, Stephens et al. 2019),
by legal injunction of active management projects (Pri-
chard et al. 2021), and by maintaining a relatively small
footprint of areas available for active management
(Fig. 1). Opposition to active forest management is
reflected in statements like “active forest management is
unwarranted because the effects of fire exclusion and
forest changes are overstated; . . .is ineffective and coun-
terproductive; . . . should be focused on the wildland
urban interface; or wildfires alone can do the work of
fuel treatments.” On the other hand, support for active
management from the commercial sector suggests that
“forest thinning alone can mitigate wildfire severity; for-
est thinning and prescribed burning can solve the prob-
lem; or managed wildfires hold no real promise.” Each
statement polarizes debates and oversimplifies the prob-
lems and the solutions (Prichard et al. 2021). Given
rapid climate change and a legacy of excluding most nat-
ural and Indigenous ignitions, effective forest landscape
restoration and adaptation strategies are more complex
and nuanced than any of these statements imply.
Advocacy and objectivity: is it one or the other?
The polarization and politicization of scientific evi-
dence impedes implementation of effective land manage-
ment plans, policies, and management by raising the
volume of the disagreement; obscuring the line between
facts, opinions, and legal requirements; creating the
impression that knowledge is more uncertain than it is;
and increasing the time to resolution. Wellerstein (2018)
argue that the premise of science as apolitical is simply a
myth, since all science takes place and is supported within
a highly political environment. Nonetheless, when scien-
tists affiliate themselves with one-sided or partisan views
and activism, they inevitably minimize their value and
that of the applied science (Lackey 2007, Pielke 2007).
Scientists are increasingly asked to comment on forest
policy and management recommendations. Facilitating
communication among stakeholders of public land man-
agement by providing practical access to the best-
available science can more effectively ensure scientifically
credible decision-making (Komatsu and Kume 2020).
However,
while
some
encourage
scientists
to
be
responsible informants for species or ecosystem conser-
vation (e.g., Lach et al. 2003), others worry that their
objectivity in conservation or ecological research may be
compromised (e.g., Scott et al. 2007), especially during
volatile times, and with arguments that are already
polarized or politicized.
Garrard et al. (2016) argue that scientists are not com-
promised when they transparently evaluate policies or
recommendations for their consistency with the best
available science, its weight of evidence, and any associ-
ated uncertainties. A systematic evaluation of best avail-
able science would include careful examination of
Indigenous and western data, information, knowledge,
and wisdom from a variety of locally and regionally rele-
vant sources (Varghese and Crawford 2020). Garrard
et al. (2016) further suggest that in the face of serious
societal, economic, or existential issues, “the standard of
debate about conservation is impoverished when scien-
tists with relevant knowledge remain silent outside the
pages of their academic journals.”
Peery et al. (2019) provide a framework for evaluating
agenda-driven science and a case example of controversy
in the scientific literature that has impacted management
of the California spotted owl and its habitats. They dis-
cuss professional norms for scientist engagement with
management and policy issues and conclude “that inten-
tionally engaging in activities outside of these profes-
sional norms to promote desired political outcomes, as
part of either the production or dissemination of science
. . .constitute[s] agenda-driven science.”
Recent controversy involving the creation and dissem-
ination of agenda-driven science is creating uncertainty
for forest managers and policy-makers throughout
wNA. Contributing to the controversy are publications
that challenge the significance of forest condition and
wildfire regime changes, and the advisability of proactive
management without addressing the core arguments
(e.g., compare Hessburg et al. [2020] and Mildrexler
et al. [2020] and their discussion of trade-offs between
wildfire dynamics, carbon sequestration, and forest
adaptation to climate warming). To aid those engaged in
designing, evaluating, and implementing science-based
adaptation options, we examine the strength of evidence
pertaining to these topics.
We first provide a framework for characterizing and
evaluating changes in forest conditions and fire regimes
in Hagmann et al. (2021). We then review the strength of
evidence documenting changes or lack thereof. Similarly,
in Prichard et al. (2021), we review the strength of evi-
dence surrounding the usefulness of various passive and
active management treatments to provide remedies to
current conditions. We then discuss 10 key questions
related to application of methods as viable treatments.

scale assessments of variation in historical fire regime
and forest vegetation conditions. These insights build on
more than a century of assessment of changing fire
behavior and forest landscape conditions. Beginning in
the 1930s, fire histories based on tree-ring and fire-scar
records
have
provided
high-resolution,
cross-dated,
multi-centenary evidence of the spatial point patterns of
fires, which have enabled precise interpretations of fire
frequency associated with recorder trees. While fire-scar
records remain a primary means of exploring historical
fire ecology, more recently developed methodologies and
multi-proxy assessments have expanded the potential to
evaluate broader temporal and spatial patterns. New
insights into complex relations between variations in cli-
mate, fire, and vegetation emerge from multi-proxy and
trans-disciplinary studies that combine sedimentary pol-
len and charcoal records (Higuera et al. 2007), large-
scale tree cohort analyses (Schoennagel et al. 2011),
early 20th-century land system inventories and surveys
(Hagmann et al. 2013, 2014, Levine et al. 2017), land-
scape reconstructions from historical black and white
photographic imagery (oblique, panoramic, stereo photo
pairs, Hessburg et al. 1999, 2000, Stockdale et al. 2015,
2019), forest inventories and land system surveys (Wil-
liams and Baker 2012, cf. Fule et al. 2014, Odion et al.
2014, cf. Stevens et al. 2016), and simulation modeling
of landscape succession and disturbance regimes (Keane
et al. 2004, 2018, McGarigal and Romme 2012). Addi-
tionally, trans-disciplinary studies that employ fire-scar
research,
climate,
archaeological,
and
ethnographic
studies show that many different Indigenous cultures
were significant contributors to the magnitude and
extent of fire influence on the wNA landscape (e.g., see
Taylor et al. 2016, Lightfoot et al. 2013).
Over the past two decades, a series of publications
using novel techniques has suggested that 19th- to 21st-
century changes in western forests and their fire regimes
have been less substantial than a much larger and more
diverse body of scientific evidence has long indicated.
Hagmann et al. (2021) provide a comprehensive review
of these papers and studies that directly evaluated them.
They show that methods and inferences in these articles
failed independent validation by other research groups
and lend their support to the findings of the larger body
of evidence.
The evidence for change in forest conditions
Hagmann et al. (2021) relied on several hundred
research articles from research groups throughout wNA
that examined historical changes to seasonally dry for-
ests patterns and processes to illustrate key departures
from conditions that existed prior to European coloniza-
tion. They found that changes in forest successional
landscapes are significant in all forest types, whether dry,
moist, or cold. Changes are prominent at tree, patch,
and local and regional landscape levels, and these
changes explain important shifts in numerous habitats
and ecosystem processes. Conditions of nonforest vege-
tation (grasslands, shrublands, sparse woodlands) are
likewise altered as a consequence of fire exclusion and
forest encroachment. While some forest and nonforest
ecosystems may not have been directly altered by fire
exclusion, the magnitude of changes suggests that it is
likely that all were indirectly impacted by alteration of
the landscape ecology and disturbance regimes that sur-
round them. Based on a preponderance of scientific evi-
dence, there can be little doubt that long-term fire
exclusion and other associated social-ecological influ-
ences contributed to extensive modification of land-
scapes across wNA, and that the magnitude of the
departures in fire regimes and landscape conditions has
increased the vulnerability of contemporary forested
landscapes to fire and drought-related stressors.
The evidence for change in fire regimes
Hagmann et al. (2021) also review the evidence for
changes in the dimensions of fire regimes (Table 1). Fire
exclusion has reduced fire frequency in all forest types,
with the degree of change generally declining with
increasing elevation, owing to orographic effects on
moisture and temperature, and topo-edaphic effects on
insolation. As a consequence, surface and ladder fuel
abundance
generally
increased
in
historically
fuel-
limited frequent-fire forests, while forest cover at higher
elevations expanded and became more successionally
homogenized (Fig. 2). In both cases, crownfire vulnera-
bility increased. Long-term fire exclusion reduced the
total amount and spatial distribution of wildfires result-
ing in a nearly universal fire deficit in forests (Parks
et al. 2015, Parks and Abatzoglou 2020).
ADAPTING FORESTS TO WILDFIRES AND CLIMATE CHANGE
Prichard et al. (2021) address 10 key questions sur-
rounding active forest management, address the assump-
tion that historical fire regimes were “natural” rather
than cultural, and describe conditions where specific
management actions are appropriate and effective for
adapting current forests to wildfires and climate change.
The authors again use a strength of scientific evidence
approach to show why the answers to the 10 questions
are relatively straightforward. In addition to evaluating
the efficacy of diverse treatments to moderate expected
fire severity, they discuss these questions in the context
of their consistency with more holistic climate- and
wildfire-adaptation
strategies
that
are
designed
to
achieve many social and ecological benefits. Moreover,
they discuss how methods designed to achieve a single
objective often fail given contemporary goals for multi-
objective landscape management. We summarize their
responses to the 10 questions here.
1) Are the effects of fire exclusion overstated? If so, are
treatments unwarranted and even counterproductive?
Xxxxx 2021
Article e02432; page 5

Prichard et al. (2021) dispute all parts of this
question. They reveal four crucial components in
their
answer,
not
the
least
of
which
is
that
increasing forest resilience and resistance to wild-
fires and climate change provides positive societal
and ecosystem benefits, which overwhelm uncer-
tainties
about
prior
historical
conditions.
They
also show that intentional forest management is
effective and corrective where practiced, but its
pace
and
footprint
are
insufficient
to
current
needs.
2) Is forest thinning alone sufficient to mitigate wild-
fire
hazard?
Whether
forest
thinning
achieves
adaptation objectives depends on several factors,
including its timing, location, rate, and spatial
scale. Reducing canopy layering and density limits
crownfire potential, but unless the abundance and
connectivity of surface fuels and fuel ladders is
also reduced, thinning can have limited effective-
ness in mitigating wildfire severity, and may make
matters worse. In forest thinning for adaptation to
climate change and wildfires, emphasis is placed
on
residual
forest
structure,
composition,
and
understory fuels rather than on the trees that are
removed (Larson and Churchill 2012, Churchill
et al. 2013).
3) Can forest thinning and prescribed burning achieve cli-
mate adaptation? Coupled thinning and prescribed
burning treatments are proven approaches to mitigat-
ing wildfire severity in many seasonally dry forests,
but they are not appropriate to all forest types, land
allocations, and conditions. These treatments require
regular maintenance application of prescribed or cul-
tural burning to maintain low surface fuel levels and
remove developing fuel ladders. The vast scale of
ongoing fuel reduction necessitates wise use of natu-
rally ignited future fires during moderate fire weather
as well.
4) Should active forest management, including forest thin-
ning, be concentrated in the wildland urban interface
(WUI)? Fuel treatments in the WUI are critically
important as is reducing continued development in
high fire danger areas (Balch et al. 2017, Radeloff
et al. 2018). People living in the WUI have ample
incentive to reduce their vulnerability to wildfires
(Cohen 2000), and many resources are available to

loss of nonforest, and lack of forest successional heterogeneity.

help them do so (Syphard et al. 2012; resources avail-
able online).7,8 However, this logic, concentrating
treatments in WUI, fails to address interconnected-
ness between social and ecological systems in land-
scapes beyond the WUI. Examples include wildfire
emissions and broad-scale smoke movement in the
atmosphere; water quality and quantity provided by
municipal watersheds distant from population cen-
ters; ember attack on WUI areas from wildfires burn-
ing several kilometers away; wildfire effects on power,
WIFI, and broadband transmission and distribution
networks; and tribal connections to ancestral territo-
ries and resources. It also avoids core decisions
related to human social values for forested landscapes
and long-term ecosystem dynamics. Alternatively,
intentional forest management both within and
beyond the WUI offers the greatest social and ecolog-
ical benefits.
5) Can wildfires on their own do the work of fuel treat-
ments? Many forests are experiencing rapid WUI
expansion,
leaving
land
managers
and
citizens
increasingly unwilling to accept the risks of managed
wildfires In the backcountry, some wildfires are
allowed to burn under specified conditions to achieve
incident and resource management objectives. How-
ever, the effects of fire exclusion are varied and exten-
sive, and managed wildfire is a spatially imprecise
tool. To increase predictability of outcomes, applica-
tion during benign to moderate fire weather may be
preferred;
this,
however,
necessitates
numerous
follow-up treatments to meet objectives, and it broad-
ens the period of landscape vulnerability to more
extreme wildfires. Considering the narrow seasonal
operating window and spatial imprecision concerns,
managed wildfires cannot be a cure-all, but can be
one of several options in a broader toolkit.
6) Is the primary objective of fuel reduction treatments to
assist in future firefighting response and containment?
The central objective of fuel treatments is to moder-
ate fire behavior when fire inevitably returns, not to
stop fire spread or reduce ignitions If fuel treatments
simply improve suppression success, less area is
burned in the short term but more area will escape
control in the future, resulting in deferred risk and
contributing to larger and more often severe wild-
fires.
7) Do fuel treatments work under extreme fire weather?
Many studies show that fuel reduction treatments are
effective at moderating subsequent fire severity, even
under extreme weather Far fewer experimental or
empirical studies challenge this premise. Moreover,
there is strong evidence that some prior burn and
reburn mosaics reduce landscape contagion, which
limits subsequent spread and severity of wildfires.
8)Is the scale of the problem too great? Can we ever catch
up? Given the scale of the area burned by wildfires
each decade compared to area treated, some surmise
that fuel treatments are futile Nevertheless, a large
body of work shows that fuel reduction treatments,
including portions of some past wildfires, effectively
mitigate subsequent fire behavior and effects. It fol-
lows that strategies can be developed to increase rather
than decrease the role of fuel reduction treatments.
The key to defining the locations, spatial scale, timing,
rate of treatment, and methods used is the desired
forest–nonforest conditions that result, their degree of
adaptation to changing climate and fire regime condi-
tions, and the degree of comfort with spatial uncer-
tainty of outcomes. Moreover, coupling Indigenous
cultural burning, fuel reduction, and prescribed fire
treatments furthers Indigenous fire stewardship and
food security (Sowerwine et al. 2019a,b), and recovers
opportunities for tribal engagement in resource man-
agement within their ancestral territories (Long and
Lake 2018, Long et al. 2020).
9) Will planting more trees in wNA forests help to miti-
gate climate change? Widespread tree planting has
been proposed as a key climate change mitigation
(Bastin et al 2019). This premise has poor scientific
support in many fire-prone regions of the world (e.g.,
Grainger et al. 2019, Lewis et al. 2019, Veldman
et al. 2019). An increasing body of evidence reveals
that proactive management to restore more resilient
forest and nonforest structure and composition over
large areas, and diversifying tree planting species
mixes, can more effectively maintain or increase car-
bon stores relative to the effects of modern wildfires
(e.g., see Hof et al. 2017).
10) Is post-fire management needed or even ecologically
justified? Prior to fire exclusion, historical land-
scapes in seasonally dry regions of wNA were the
product of complex mosaics of low-, moderate- and
high-severity fire patches, which yielded highly vari-
able patterns of surviving forest and scattered fire
refugia (ie., unburned patches that functioned as
seed sources for postfire tree regeneration in their
vicinity).
After
contemporaneous wildfires,
this
mosaic is often simplified by large high-severity fire
patches, and fire refugia are operationally burned
out in closing suppression actions. Within one to
two decades after a high-severity fire, dead wood
accumulations
contribute
to
uncharacteristically
high surface fuel loads. Post-fire removal of the dead
understory stems (i.e., those that had previously col-
onized the landscape during the lengthy period of
fire exclusion) by harvest or reburning can mimic
this historical reburn influence, thereby minimizing
surface
fuels
in
some
developing
new
forests
(Stevens-Rumann and Morgan 2016), and reducing
future
wildfire
vulnerability
(Coppoletta
et al.
2016). The ecological justification for this post-fire
removal of the smaller dead understory trees can be

observed in the low surface fuel loads associated
with the frequent reburning of pre-management era
landscapes and modern-day wilderness areas. It is
also clearly revealed in intentional Indigenous cul-
tural burning practices. Indigenous fire stewardship
actively mediated post-fire landscape effects to stag-
ger the availability of desired resources and species
over time, and ensure their quality, quantity, and
abundance (Boyd 1999, Lake and Christianson
2019).
STRATEGIES FOR ADAPTING WESTERN LANDSCAPES
Changes in forested landscapes throughout wNA are
somewhat unique geographically, as are the stories of
change. To consider appropriate climate and wildfire
adaptation strategies, managers are compelled to evalu-
ate current vegetation and fuel conditions, the influences
that precipitated changes in conditions, the magnitude
of the changes, ecological and social constraints to adap-
tation, patch to landscape vulnerability to changing cli-
matic and wildfire regimes, and nonnative species and
any sensitive or endangered species concerns.
Stephens et al. (2010) recommend four strategies for
adapting western landscapes to changing climatic and
wildfire regimes, and they can be applied in a variety of
contexts. They define resistance work as that which miti-
gates expected wildfire effects and protects valued
resources, while realignment work modifies existing con-
ditions to restore key ecosystem patterns and the pro-
cesses they drive. Creating resilient conditions improves
the natural capacity of an ecosystem to respond favor-
ably when unplanned disturbances occur. Finally, they
present response work as any intentional facilitation to
achieve socially and ecologically desirable results that
are otherwise difficult to achieve. Each of these strategies
can play a role in proactive management going forward.
Where their application also considers Indigenous cul-
tural adaptations to climate, vital ecosystem processes,
and active cultural use of fire, there will be greater likeli-
hood that resulting vegetation conditions are strongly
linked to culturally valued resources and services (Power
et al. 2018).
Whether reactive or proactive fire management
Modern wildfire suppression extinguishes essentially
all fire starts except those that overwhelm fire sup-
pression capacity and can only be extinguished when
aided by a significant change in the weather (North
et al. 2015). Fires burning under extreme fire weather
often burn vast areas, much larger than the current
footprint of managed wildfires and other fuel treat-
ment projects. As a consequence, wildfires that escape
initial
suppression
efforts
burn
under
the
most
extreme fire weather conditions and do most of the
vegetation management in wNA ecosystems (Calkin
et al. 2005, North et al. 2015). Appropriately designed
thinning, burning, and managed wildfire treatments,
that are tailored to topo-edaphic conditions would be
helpful additions to this scenario (sensu Taylor and
Skinner 2003, Hessburg et al. 2015). Such treatments
would prepare landscapes for wildfires that will inevi-
tably follow.
Managing wildfires that burn under extreme fire
weather is a blunt management response, which most
often results in failure to meet resource management or
conservation objectives. Science-based strategies for for-
est and fuel management are well known, but lack of
social license and sufficient financial and personnel
resources currently limit fuel reduction programs to a
small percentage of wNA forestlands (Hessburg et al.
2020). Increasing costs of fire suppression and lack of
control during large fire growth days reveals a reactive
management posture that is progressively prone to fail-
ure, despite ever-increasing investments (North et al.
2015, Stephens et al. 2020). Thus, a business-as-usual
approach to wildfire in fire-prone regions will not solve
the current wildfire dilemma (Moreira et al. 2020).
Strategic management of regional landscapes is needed
that establishes topographically sensible (sensu Povak
et al.
2018
and
Taylor
and
Skinner
2003),
fire-
maintained, control and anchor points (e.g., see Wei
et al. 2019). This would improve fire manager usage of
future wildfires as adaptation tools.
A more proactive and evidence-based management
goal is to restore active wildland fire regimes and land-
scape resilience to climate change, and actively enable
future wildland fires, prescribed and cultural burning,
and managed wildfire to provide a higher standard of
social-ecological work. To achieve this goal, massive
progress and investment are needed (Madeira and Gart-
ner 2018) to transition management from a reactive to a
proactive, forward-looking stance. Such an approach
allows for the direct adaptation of wildfire regimes by
intentionally crafting landscape patterns that drive more
benign fire behavior and less severe drought effects. This
will require radically increasing the areal extent of
restorative and adaptive fuel reduction treatments as is
appropriate to conditions and land allocations. It will
also require increased use of natural wildfire ignitions
(as above) under moderate fire weather conditions, to
recapture the once extensive moderate influences of
wildfires, and then maintain that progress with con-
trolled (prescribed and cultural) burning and thinning as
needed.
The nested character of regional landscapes holds
adaptation clues
The hierarchical organization of historical wNA land-
scapes influences countless ecosystem functions, includ-
ing scale-dependent spatial and temporal controls that
drive wildfire behavior and effects, and the cross-
connection between levels of organization. Characteris-
tics of this organization and its influence on ecosystem

functions can inform realignment of current systems
with early 21st-century and projected future climates
(Hessburg et al. 2016, 2019). Three important ideas
associated with that nested structure are that (1) at a
fine spatial scale, species traits and adaptations drive
within-patch structure, composition, and response to
disturbances; (2) cross-connections between fine-scale
patch structure and composition and meso-scale land-
scape patchworks influence fire frequency and severity
because they form the percolation surface where distur-
bance propagates, and the manner of propagation; and
(3) cross-connections between non-forest and forested
landscapes mediate broad spatial patterns of fire behav-
ior attributes and their effects. These three ideas help
shape a scientifically supported landscape adaptation
framework (Hessburg et al. 2015, 2019).
Additionally, we are learning through integration of
western science with traditional ecological knowledge
that Indigenous fire use and broader landscape steward-
ship practices were upheld in tribal communities as
human
services
for
ecosystems.
Indigenous
tribes
acknowledged and promoted multi-generational contri-
butions to foster landscape resistance and resilience.
Trans-generational fire use also promoted post-fire
recovery of landscapes and habitats where culturally val-
ued drought-tolerant, fire-adapted plant species were
adversely influenced by a fire (Huffman 2013).
BEYOND THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE
The precautionary principle holds that when the
potential for adverse effects is unknown or difficult to
quantify; the burden of proof rests on the proponent of
an activity to demonstrate that lack of harm is the most
likely outcome. However, it is virtually impossible to
demonstrate lack of harm for most any activity, includ-
ing no action, especially in a rapidly changing environ-
ment. Moreover, one-sided, or single-issue application of
the principle can overlook desired ecosystem services,
species, and processes that proactive work could have
protected. Given human influence on climate and wild-
fire regimes the world over, a no-action alternative that
purports to let so-called natural processes like modern
wildfires operate unfettered is grossly misleading. These
processes are operating within a human-influenced tem-
plate globally, and their regime characteristics and fuel
conditions have been altered by humans, increasing the
likelihood that large portions of many modern wildfires
are unnatural.
Modern wildfire management dominated by fire sup-
pression is perceived by many as a no-action alternative
when compared to active restoration and adaptation in
planning and management. However, active suppression
of 98% of wildfire ignitions (North et al. 2015) hardly
qualifies as no action, as we have shown earlier. The
small proportion of wildfires that escape containment all
too often rapidly and indiscriminately convert forest to
non-forest conditions. This is an altogether unevaluated
planning outcome, and the recovery of forest structure
and processes can take decades to centuries, if it occurs
at all. Furthermore, fire suppression costs currently
exceed US$2 billion annually, not including loss of life
and property, and detrimental impacts to lifeways,
human health, and livelihoods, while the total annual-
ized economic burden of wildfires ranges from US$71
billion to US$347 billion (Thomas et al. 2017; data
available online).9
The precautionary principle is indeed useful guidance,
but it must be applied equally to what are often mistak-
enly perceived as no-action alternatives. Lacking this
clarity, broad application of the precautionary principle
as a conservation approach can result in greater long-
term harm than more ecologically intuitive remedies, as
can be seen within the Northwest Forest Plan area of the
eastern Cascade and Klamath Mountain regions (Spies
et al. 2019, Stephens et al. 2019). There, networks of
late-successional reserves (LSRs) for the northern spot-
ted owl in seasonally dry, historically frequent-fire for-
ests increase the likelihood of their elimination by
extreme wildfire events (Henson et al 2013, Spies et al.
2018, 2019). There is simply too much at stake to require
unattainable certainty about potential risk of harm or
losses (Wood and Jones 2019).
The precautionary principle can become the “paralyz-
ing principle” given irreducible uncertainty about risk of
loss associated with action and no-action alternatives
(Sunstein 2003). The loss of ˜30 million mature and old
pine trees during a recent extreme drought in south-
central California (Asner et al. 2016) is a stark reminder
of the pitfall of requiring unduly high certainty despite
decades of established science showing the efficacy of
treatments that foster resilient forest structure and com-
position (Henson et al. 2018, Fettig et al. 2019). Absent
150–170 yr of frequent fires, overgrown forest density
conditions produced a massive and predictable die-off
event,
facilitated
by
tree-killing
bark
beetles
and
drought, that proactive implementation of climate- and
wildfire-adaptation strategies could have mitigated (Ste-
phens et al. 2018, Fettig et al. 2019). Remedying such
conditions would have required careful consideration of
changes over the period of fire exclusion, the effects of
climatic changes looking forward, and any related ESA
(Endangered Species Act) concerns.
Dealing with uncertainty
There is much uncertainty to science, including that
surrounding our knowledge of historical and contempo-
rary forest ecology, future conditions, and adaptive for-
est management. In that light, active forest management
projects with objectives of restoring more resilient and
resistant structure and composition can be assessed
using

uncertainty associated with proactive versus reactive
treatment alternatives. For example, in the context of
changing wildfire regimes and climatic conditions, what
are the uncertainties, trade-offs, and likely consequences
to U.S., Canadian, and Mexican Indigenous and non-
indigenous people, infrastructure, ecosystems, native
species and habitats of
1) Restoring active fire regimes to dry, moist, and cold
forest ecosystems,
2) Continued fire suppression in these same forest
types,
3) Proposed proactive, reactive, and no-action manage-
ment alternatives,
4) Post-fire forest regeneration under action and no-
action alternatives, and
5) Post-fire harvest/non-harvest of the younger fire-
killed trees to mimic reburns?
REFRAMING MANAGEMENT AND POLICY
As demonstrated in literature reviews, the disturbance
ecology of an ecosystem may still be the most valuable
lens through which climate-related events and outcomes
may be understood (Long 2009, Newman 2019, Frank-
lin and Johnson 2013). Over millennia, Indigenous fire
use in many areas amplified fire frequency to reduce the
likelihood of more extreme wildfires and their effects on
culturally valued resources and conditions. This cultur-
ally modified disturbance regime increased the resilience
and resistance of vegetation and landscape conditions to
changing climatic conditions and associated distur-
bances.
More recently, ecological forestry principles recognize
the value of management planning that incorporates the
influence of natural disturbance processes on forest
dynamics (Franklin et al. 2018). Additionally, as shown
by Indigenous experience, natural lightning ignitions can
be supplemented to achieve desired conditions. In uncer-
tain times, management might better focus on the long-
term persistence of that native biodiversity that evolved
within the local, culturally enhanced, disturbance regime,
and will likely go extinct with rapid or extreme changes to
those regime properties (Newman 2019). Where possible,
adapting local landscapes to conserve key aspects of cul-
turally enhanced disturbance regimes could be vital to
preserving functioning ecosystems and to the native bio-
diversity that requires non-extreme disturbance for its
continued existence (Franklin and Johnson 2012, North
et al. 2014), even where single-species conservation and
broader ecosystem goals may appear to be in conflict at
other scales (Henson et al. 2013).
Managers and scientists have repeatedly proposed
management directions that incorporate knowledge of
disturbance ecology and methods that adequately mimic
and recover local disturbance regimes; however, socioe-
conomic challenges have impeded widespread implemen-
tation of these strategies (Long 2009). Effective direction
would be proactive rather than reactive, recognizing that
just as with human society, all desired ecological out-
comes are not possible in the same place, at the same
time.
Recommendations
In this light, what constitutes adaptation of wNA for-
ests in these uncertain times? Is bias for action rather
than inaction recommended?
Scientific knowledge is always growing and incom-
plete. However, a preponderance of evidence suggests
that proactive management can prepare many land-
scapes for future wildfires and the maintenance work
they can provide. This would also reduce emphasis on
high-maintenance solutions and the overarching and
increasingly burdensome role of wildfire suppression
and its expenditures.
Emphasize whole landscape and multi-scale adaptation.—
Stand management as applied to western U.S. and Cana-
dian public lands typically emphasizes forested areas
where there are commercial opportunities for mechani-
cal treatments in specific stands of trees. This focus
misses many locations where proactive treatments may
be most useful to adapting an entire landscape. Con-
ducting whole landscape evaluations of forest condi-
tions, fire regime departures, and expected future climate
and weather conditions can powerfully aid in defining
those places that would most benefit from adaptation
treatments (North et al. 2009, Hessburg et al. 2013,
2016, Meyer et al. 2021).
Ongoing collaborative partnerships also recommend
that emphasis on timber volume production from pub-
lic lands has a negative influence on partner support
for projects and trust maintenance (Hessburg et al.
2020), and it tends to force the hand of managers to
rank commercial treatments over others that may be
more truly adaptive. Alternatively, management and
planning that emphasizes area restored and adapted
could build trust and a broader base of support, while
still providing timber volume to sustain rural mills
and economies (Rummer et al. 2005). Increasingly,
collaborative restoration partnerships with Indigenous
communities, having tribes as part of the leadership
and management, can increase opportunities for rein-
stating tribal stewardship practices, with tribes, local
communities, and the broader society as beneficiaries
of active management that achieves shared values
(Lake et al. 2018, Long and Lake 2018).
Large and old trees.—Most research reveals that broadly
conserving large and old fire-resistant trees and replac-
ing those that were removed or killed by harvest,
drought, insects, pathogens, and wildfires provides a
strong backbone of resilient structure and habitat to sea-
sonally dry pine and mixed-conifer ecosystems (Spies
et al. 2018, 2019).

Clumped and gapped trees.—As is appropriate to local
seasonally dry forest types, restoring tree clump and gap
patterns, and increasing area of these conditions will
provide a solid patch-to-local landscape bet-hedging
strategy in a warming future with increasing burned area
(Larson and Churchill 2012, Churchill et al. 2013,
LeFevre et al. 2020).
Successionally
heterogeneous
forests.—Successional
heterogeneity, whether fine-, meso-, or coarse-grained,
was an historical consequence of patterns of environ-
mental productivity and fire–climate interactions with
vegetation. It reinforced a continual shifting of diverse
but similar patterns of heterogeneity at each scale of
observation. As is appropriate to forest types and phys-
iographic domains, restoring and maintaining forms of
this heterogeneity will encourage a wider variety of wild-
fire and habitat outcomes, and reduce the need for
aggressive fire suppression in many areas (Perry et al.
2011). This can be accomplished by adapting current
spatial patterns of seral stages to more frequent burning
and reburning (Stephens et al. 2020). Indigenous and
Western knowledge can jointly aid in determining how
best to adapt current and projected future conditions.
Using the topo-edaphic template.—Throughout wNA,
topography, geomorphology, lithologies, and soils pro-
vide the template for spatially varying forest cover types,
structural conditions, and their variations (Taylor and
Skinner 2003, Hessburg et al. 2015). Fire exclusion and
other influences have weakened connections to this tem-
plate. Realigning spatial patterns of nonforest and forest
successional pattern conditions (e.g., open vs. closed
canopy, fire-tolerant vs. intolerant species) to this tem-
plate will aid in adapting landscapes to changing climatic
and wildfire regimes. For example, restoring non-forest
and low-density forest cover patches to south-facing
slopes and ridgetops and higher-density forest cover
patches on north aspects and valley bottoms are exam-
ples of strengthening connections to the topographic
template (Hessburg et al. 2015, 2019). These underlying
conditions continually co-create the environments for
disturbance and revegetation as the climate changes
(Taylor and Skinner 2003, Hessburg et al. 2015, 2016).
Forests and their nonforests.—Meadows,
shrublands,
savannahs, and preforest conditions result from natu-
ral succession, disturbance dynamics, and reburning
(Prichard et al. 2017). Restoring more characteristic
nonforest-forest
patterns
in
and
among
all
forest
types at fine, meso, and broad scales could signifi-
cantly realign primary ecosystem processes, carbon
storage, and hydrologic regimes with the warming cli-
mate (Shakesby and Doerr 2006). As recent history
has shown, many pre-fire-suppression era nonforest
areas throughout wNA became forested absent active
fire regimes during the mild mid-20th-century cli-
matic period (Hessburg et al. 2019).
RESEARCH NEEDS
The reviews of Hagmann et al. (2021) and Prichard
et al. (2021) show deepening understanding of the fire
and landscape ecology of wNA forests; however, sub-
stantive knowledge gaps remain. Here, we discuss the
following research needs that emerged from this review:.
1) Fortifying future vegetation and wildfire projections
with insights from landscape ecology research Most
continental to regional projections of climate influ-
ence on biotic conditions and physical processes use a
range of intuitive climatic drivers to explain responses
to warming (Rosenzweig et al. 2008, Parks et al.
2015, Abatzoglou and Williams 2016). Outcomes are
presented as ostensibly unaffected by bottom-up or
meso-scale spatial variation in biotic, environmental,
disturbance history, or topoedaphic conditions inher-
ent to the system(s) of interest. From the standpoint
of
landscape
ecology
theory
and
practice,
this
approach misses key cross-scale interactions between
the climate system and highly varying biophysical set-
tings, which are known to modify climate system
inputs and alter spatial and temporal patterns of real-
ized conditions (Wu and Loucks 1995). Hurteau
et al. (2019) for example, showed that future projec-
tions of burned area under climate change, which
accounted for interactions among prior fires on sur-
face and canopy fuel availability, reduced area burned
by 14.3% in the Sierra Nevada compared to projec-
tions where only climate drivers were considered.
Hybrid research and modeling are needed among cli-
mate change scientists and landscape ecologists to
improve projections of vegetation and burned area
changes, and species ranges.
2) Multi-proxy evidence is more informative than single
proxy Observing and integrating knowledge of the
multi-level dimensions of forest landscapes and their
wildfire regimes provides deeper insight into how pat-
terns influence processes, and it improves change
detection (Hagmann et al. 2021). Some regions are
already represented by multi-level studies, but in
some cases, they could be better integrated. Multi-
scale and multi-proxy historical reconstructions are
still needed for other regions of wNA to better under-
stand variations in forest–nonforest relations and suc-
cessional heterogeneity that are better aligned with
changing climatic and wildfire regimes. With these
insights, managers and policy-makers will be better
able to understand how warming and drying may
affect adaptation strategies.
3) More wildfire–forest dynamics carbon research is
needed Recent studies show that strategies for adapt-
ing current forests to wildfires and climate change
may result in more terrestrial carbon storage than
business-as-usual scenarios. The reason is that large
fuel buildup under fire exclusion renders forest car-
bon stores vulnerable to large, high-severity fire
Xxxxx 2021

events (Liang et al. 2018, Hurteau et al. 2019). This
nascent inquiry area deserves significant investment
and increased scope to determine suitable landscape
management strategies, and where they may best
apply.
4) Disturbance–fish-and-wildlife-habitat connections As
Newman (2019) suggests, native species and their
habitats are tied to disturbance regimes of local and
regional landscapes. Our current knowledge of these
species-disturbance regime linkages is weak in many
areas and could be much better understood. Even
where 25 yr of research is available for one of the
most intensively studied bird species, that knowledge
is not preventing population declines for Northern
Spotted Owls (Spies et al. 2019, Stephens et al.
2019). As a result, Henson et al. (2018) advocated a
coarse-filter approach that incorporates disturbance
ecology in management for spotted owl habitat.
Understanding and managing spatial domains to
restore these more functional disturbance regimes is
an intuitive coarse-filter conservation strategy for ter-
restrial and aquatic species.
5) A role for decision support tools Predicting future veg-
etation, climate, and wildfire conditions, and trade-
offs among various habitats and resources across a
set of potential management scenarios is intellectu-
ally and computationally challenging. Considering
the large number of data layers, the one-to-many and
many-to-one interactions among conditions repre-
sented by these layers, and variation in these relation-
ships by scenario thwarts careful evaluation by even
the best planning intellects. Decision support tools
are designed for this complex and integrated planning
environment and are useful for evaluating trade-offs
among changing conditions, outcomes, and manage-
ment scenarios (Kangas and Kangas 2005, Reynolds
et al. 2014). Using such tools, managers and scien-
tists can observe trade-offs and related positive and
negative cascades associated with varied management
scenarios and discover their primary drivers.
6) Innovation and investment in multi-party monitoring
and adaptive management Adaptive forest manage-
ment has been recommended by scientists and man-
agers
for
decades
(Lee
1999),
however,
it
has
functioned more as an abstraction than an applied
reality (Bormann et al. 2007). While adaptive man-
agement provided the core of Indigenous landscape
management methods (Anderson 2013), there are
several key reasons for delayed application in con-
temporary
management.
Adaptive
management
depends on watchful learning; what we today call
ecosystem monitoring, which can be time consuming
and expensive, and results often come after lengthy
delays. Sufficient monitoring is rarely budgeted for,
and consequently, an adaptive process is inhibited.
Without agreement on the monitoring questions and
goals of management, disputes remain unresolved.
Innovation and investment are needed in this area to
develop better methods of multi-party goal setting,
and efficient and inexpensive means of monitoring;
for example, multi-scale photography or remote sens-
ing in addition to intensive plot and survey applica-
tion. Another monitoring approach proposed by
Tribes is to use cultural keystone species as indicators
of ecosystem integrity and function (Garibaldi and
Turner 2004). Results from monitoring a representa-
tive subset of forest conditions and projects could be
extrapolated to similar conditions. This would enable
more rapid learning and implementation, which are
core concerns. Effective learning of this sort will
become more essential as expanding human popula-
tions search for better ways to live sustainably on
increasingly dynamic wNA landscapes.
CONCLUSIONS
Here, we have described how policy and management
choices of the last two centuries yielded forest conditions
throughout much of wNA that are vulnerable to the
effects of rapid climatic warming, including increasing
fire and drought severity. We summarized core messages
of Hagmann et al. (2021) and Prichard et al. (2021),
detailing widespread changes in forested landscapes and
wildfire regimes since the influx of European colonists,
and addressing popular questions about the capacity of
management practices to reverse or mitigate the worst
effects of these changes. We address concerns about the
influence of agenda-driven science and reiterate that the
precautionary principle can become the paralyzing princi-
ple given uncertainty about the risk of losses associated
with action and no-action alternatives. We discussed the
near impossibility of demonstrating lack of harm for
most any action, including inaction, especially in a
rapidly changing environment.
We provided recommendations for reframing forest
and fire management and their related policy underpin-
nings, emphasizing (1) whole landscape and multi-scale
adaptation; (2) protection of large and old fire- and
drought-tolerant trees and old forests; (3) restoration of
clumped and gapped tree patterns at fine and meso spa-
tial scales; (4) creation of successionally heterogeneous
forests; (5) use of topography to realign current condi-
tions to the biophysical template; and (6) restoration of
nonforest conditions. Climate change will create more
nonforest and more young open canopy forest condi-
tions (Parks et al. 2016, Hessburg et al. 2019, Coop
et al. 2020); the opportunity for management is to place
those conditions and patch sizes in locations that pro-
vide the greatest social and ecological benefits while con-
serving and recruiting old trees and old forest where
possible.
Some today call for cultivating pyrodiversity to
advance biodiversity (Parr and Andersen 2006, Taylor
et al. 2012, Bowman et al. 2016). However, not all
heterogeneity is equally well adapted to the topogra-
phy, soils, and varied environmental settings and fire

regimes of wNA landscapes, and thus may endanger
native biodiversity. Climate and wildfire adaptation
requires structural and compositional patterns and
pattern variations that are in synch with biophysical
settings, reinforce the desired fire regimes, and reduce
undesirable impacts of climatic warming to socioeco-
logical communities.
We close our review with a short list of research
needs. Key among them is the need to better under-
stand the disturbance regimes that native plants and
animals evolved with and through which persistence
occurred even as we act proactively to restore pat-
tern–process interactions and adapt these landscapes
to warming climate. Most legal battles concerning for-
est management today are about native biodiversity,
old tree or old forest conservation, conservation of
threatened and endangered species, and impacts of
timber harvesting. Yet, native species and their habi-
tats are tied to disturbance regimes of local and regio-
nal
landscapes
and
their
pattern
variations.
Our
current knowledge of these species-disturbance regime
linkages is weak, yet these dynamics might become a
focal
means
of
biodiversity
conservation
(Henson
et al. 2013).
Finally, we discussed how some of these climatic
and fire regime effects were common to landscapes
inhabited by the Indigenous people of wNA, and in
closing, we return to those ideas. Because of signifi-
cant vulnerabilities linked to native wildfire regimes,
Indigenous people intentionally managed wildfire for
millennia to provide a broad variety of life-supporting
resources, food and medicine security, protect lifeways,
sacred places, and deeply held traditions, and to
increase personal safety. This intentional management
was a transgenerational commitment; prior genera-
tions took responsibility for the quality and abun-
dance
of
desired
conditions
they
passed
on
to
subsequent
generations.
Since
the
mid-1850s,
the
majority of EuroAmerican colonists and present-day
citizens have neither practiced this intentional manage-
ment nor passed on a transgenerational commitment.
Yet, we are ever more dependent as a society on the
ecosystem services that functional fire-adapted land-
scapes provide. Given the known risks of modern
wildfires and climate change, embracing the role of
fire and a return to intentional transgenerational man-
agement is of critical importance.
