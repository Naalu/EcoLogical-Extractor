Effects of an Intense Prescribed Forest Fire: Is It
Ecological Restoration?

Abstract
Relatively intense burning has been suggested as a possible
alternative to the restoration of pre-European settlement
forest conditions and fire regime in mixed conifer forests, in
contrast to thinning of trees and light prescribed burning. In
1993 a management-ignited fire in a dense, never-harvested
forest in Grand Canyon National Park escaped prescription
and burned with greater intensity and severity than
anticipated. We sampled the burned site and an adjacent
unburned site (270 ha each) 6 years after the fire to assess
burn effects on tree structure (species composition, size and
age distributions, regeneration, and snags), forest floor
fuels, and coarse woody debris. Tree structure before fire-
regime disruption (1879 CE) was reconstructed with
dendroecological techniques. By 6 years after burn the fire
reduced average tree density (331 trees/ha) and basal area
(28.5m2/ha) to levels similar to pre-European reference
conditions (approximately 246 trees/ha and 28.5m2/ha).
Mortality was concentrated in fire-susceptible species,
especially white fir, restoring dominance by fire-resistant
ponderosa pine. Forest floor fuels were reduced, and
regeneration by aspen and understory plants was vigorous.
Densities of large snags and logs were high. However the
fire also killed a high proportion of old-growth trees,
especially aspen. Burning created more spatial variability in
forest structure than was present before fire-regime disrup-
tion by killing many trees in some areas of the site but few
in other areas. The intentional use of severe burning would
be challenging to managers because of the increased risk of
escaped fires, but the ecological outcome of this particular
wildfire was not inconsistent with ecological restoration
goals for this ecosystem type.
Key words: aspen (Populus tremuloides), Grand Canyon,

Introduction
Several different approaches have been suggested for restor-
ing surface fire to western forests from which fire has been
excluded for over a century. As described by Stephenson
(1999) for Sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum [Lindl.] Buch-
holz) forests, process restoration advocates have sought to use
fire as the primary tool to restore conditions similar to those
of historical forests, while structural restoration advocates
argued for deliberate thinning to restore near-historical forest
structure before burning. Although the terms process and
structural restoration are an oversimplification of a nuanced
reality (Moore et al. 1999; Stephenson 1999), they are a useful
framework for comparison. In a simulation study applying the
forest gap model FACET in mixed conifer forest of the Sierra
Nevada, Miller and Urban (2000) tested these two restoration
approaches and added a third alternative: (1) simple reintro-
duction of surface fire at the historical frequency (process
only); (2) tree thinning (structural manipulation) followed
by reintroduction of fire; and (3) intense prescribed fires,
killing a number of trees, followed by surface fire reintroduc-
tion. They concluded that all three options eventually restored
forests within the range of natural variability (RNV) (Landres
et al. 1999), although much more time was required under the
first alternative. However Miller and Urban (2000) recog-
nized that the simulation results were uncertain because the
fire behavior model they used could not simulate canopy
burning, leaving unresolved the practical question of whether
either low- or high-intensity prescribed fires (alternatives 1
and 3) could actually be applied in fire-excluded forests with-
out initiating a crownfire.
The debate over restoration approach is highly relevant
in the 2,950,000 ha of ponderosa pine (species names are
summarized in Table 1) and lower mixed conifer forests in
the Southwest (Fiedler et al. 2002; O’Brien 2002). In New
Mexico over 90% of these forests are considered at mod-
erate or high risk for crownfire due to dense stand struc-
ture and accumulated fuels (Fiedler et al. 2002). Over two
decades of experimentation with fire reintroduction (alter-
native 1) show that prescribed fire at frequent intervals can
be conducted effectively, but established young trees are
very resistant to thinning from surface fires (Peterson et al.
1994; Sackett et al. 1996). Hence the trajectory of forest
change does not move toward RNV, even in a multi-
century simulation with the FIRESUM ecological process
model (Covington et al. 2001). In contrast, experiments
with structural manipulation—tree thinning—followed by
surface fire (alternative 2) have been shown to rapidly

restore many key structural and functional forest attributes
(Scott 1998; Lynch et al. 2000; Fule´ et al. 2001, 2002a).
Long-term simulation indicated that these conditions
could be maintained after the original manipulation simply
by burning at historical intervals (Covington et al. 2001;
Fiedler et al. 2002; Fule´ et al. 2002a). However there are
constraints to the thinning-and-burning approach, includ-
ing the high cost of thinning (Lynch et al. 2000; Fule´ et al.
2002a), soil damage associated with mechanical equipment
and slash disposal, exotic species, deleterious effects on
some wildlife species (Tiedemann et al. 2000; Germaine &
Germaine 2002), management policies restricting tree
cutting in places such as national parks and wilderness
areas, and finally the sheer scale of forest area at risk.
Thus it would be helpful to have quantitative information
about
other
restoration
options,
such
as
Miller
and
Urban’s (2000) alternative 3: structural change achieved
by intense prescribed fire rather than thinning.
A simulated test of this alternative is beyond the cap-
abilities of fire behavior and effects models, and Sackett
et al. (1996) pointed out the practical difficulties of actu-
ally experimenting with intense burning. Therefore the
best data with which to assess intense burning comes from
an actual example. We selected a 1993 prescribed fire in a
ponderosa pine/mixed conifer forest in Grand Canyon
National Park that burned more intensely than antici-
pated. The Grand Canyon forest has never been har-
vested, and most of it has had over a century of fire
exclusion (White & Vankat 1993; Wolf & Mast 1998),
leading to substantial increases in forest density (Fule´
et al. 2002b). The area is valuable as a study site because
extensive analysis of past and present forest structure and
fire regime has been carried out (Fule´ et al. 2002b, 2003).
We measured paired burned and unburned sites to test
the hypothesis suggested by Miller and Urban (2000):
intense burning would be expected to preferentially kill
small and fire-susceptible trees and reduce surface fuels
and canopy cover, restoring a forest structure similar to
the RNV. This hypothesis was bounded by two alter-
native hypotheses: (1) fire would have relatively little
effect on forest structure, because trees would resist
mortality (e.g., Sackett et al. 1996; Covington et al.
2001), or (2) fire would have excessively severe effects,
altering forest structure in a manner inconsistent with the
RNV and leading to long-term ecological degradation
(e.g., Barton 2002).
Methods
Study Area
On 20 September 1993 a 490-ha prescribed fire unit called
Northwest III was ignited by Grand Canyon National Park
staff in ponderosa pine, aspen, and mixed conifer forests
on Swamp Ridge, Kaibab Plateau, in northern Arizona
(36200N, 112150W). Species names are summarized in
Table 1. Surface fuels averaged 37.3 Mg/ha of woody debris
and 28.3 Mg/ha of forest floor litter and duff (Duhnkrack
1993). On the day of ignition temperatures ranged from
15.6 to 20 C, and relative humidity ranged from 15 to 32%.
Unanticipated high winds gusting up to 48 km/hr led to
relatively intense fire behavior beginning on 22 Septem-
ber, including tree torching and spotfires. The status of the
fire was converted to a wildfire on 23 September 1993 and
was suppressed by 30 September without escaping the
original fire boundaries (Nichols et al. 1994).
Paired study sites were selected in the geographic center
of the burned area (burn) and an adjacent unburned area
(unburn), 270 ha each, separated by a road. Elevation
ranged from 2,427 to 2,549 m. Soil information was derived
from
an
ongoing
soil
survey
(A.
Dewall,
National
Resource Conservation Service, personal communication,
2002); soils were tentatively classified as the Elledge family
(fine, mixed, superactive, and mesic Typic Paleustalfs).
Average annual precipitation at the North Rim ranger
station (elevation 2,564 m) is 64.7 cm, with an average
annual snowfall of 356 cm. Temperatures range from an
average July maximum of 25.1C to an average January
minimum of 28.2C (Western Regional Climate Center,
http://www.wrcc.dri.edu).
The
unburned
study
area
(Swamp Ridge) was included in a study of forest structure
and fire regime over an elevational transect on the Kaibab
Plateau. Before 1879 CE, the fire regime was one of
frequent surface fires, often covering large areas. The
Weibull median probability interval, a statistic often used
to assess the average frequency of fire recurrence (Swetnam
& Baisan 2003), was 5.06 years and 8.70 years for
fires scarring 25% or more of the sample trees, assumed

to be larger fires (Fule´ et al. 2003). No post-1879 fire was
recorded on the site in park records nor was there evidence
in the form of fire scarring, except for fire scarring on a
single sample tree in 1954 (Fule´ et al. 2003). The elimina-
tion of surface fires after 1879 was most likely the result of
heavy grazing by domestic livestock introduced by Eur-
opean settlers (Altschul & Fairley 1989), removing herbac-
eous fuels, followed by fire suppression policies when the
area was set aside as a reserve in 1893 and then a National
Park in 1919 (Fule´ et al. 2003).
Before fire exclusion, the frequent fire regime included
both lightning- and human-ignited fires. Because it is gener-
ally difficult to estimate the cause of a fire from fire-scarred
tree data, the role of human-ignited fires has been inade-
quately quantified in southwestern forests. However, Baisan
and Swetnam (1997) and Allen (2002) used evidence from
lightning density, fire seasonality, and comparison of popu-
lated with unpopulated areas to suggest that human-ignited
fires may have played a relatively minor role because of
saturation by lightning in southwestern uplands. The Grand
Canyon region was not pristine (sensu Denevan 1992) in the
sense of an absence of people before European settlement;
in fact, the region has a very long history and pre-history of
human presence (Altschul & Fairley 1989). However in
contrast to areas where burning by indigenous inhabitants
fundamentally regulated the fire regime (e.g., Australia
[Lewis 1994] and California [Anderson 1996]), the scale of
changes in forest ecosystem structure and disturbance
regime at Grand Canyon associated with European settle-
ment far exceeded the pre-European range of variability
(Fule´ et al. 2002b, 2003). Thus the date of European settle-
ment/fire-regime disruption is a useful reference point
against which to compare forest change due to recent
human influence, rather than a switch between alternative
anthropogenic fire regimes.
Field Methods
Sampling plot centers were located on a systematic 300-m
grid placed over each sampling site. The unburned site was
sampled in July and August 1998, and the burned site was
sampled in June and July 1999. We allowed a 6-year period
after the fire to capture tree mortality, because conifers
often take several years to die following fire (Sackett et al.
1996; Kaufmann & Covington 2001). Sampling plots were
0.1 ha (20 3 50 m) in size, oriented with the 50-m sides
uphilldownhill to maximize sampling of variability along
the elevational gradient and to permit correction of the
plot area for slope. Plot corners and centers were marked
with 30-cm iron stakes sunk flush to the forest floor, and
the distance and bearing from a tagged reference tree to
the center was recorded. Tree species and authors are
summarized in Table 1. Trees greater than 15 cm diameter
at breast height (dbh) were measured on the entire plot
(1,000 m2), and trees between 2.5 and 15 cm dbh were
measured on one-quarter plot (250 m2); all trees were
tagged and tree condition was noted (1, live; 2, declining;
3, recent snag [standing dead tree]; 4, loose bark snag; 5,
clean snag; 6, snag broken above breast height; 7, snag
broken below breast height; 8, downed dead tree [also
called log]; and 9, cut stump) (Thomas et al. 1979). All
living and dead trees potentially old and large enough to
have become established before European settlement
(circa 1880) were identified as potentially pre-settlement
trees in the field. All conifers with dbh greater than
37.5 cm or ponderosa of any size with yellowed bark
(White 1985) were considered potentially pre-settlement
trees. All living potentially pre-settlement trees and 10%
of all post-settlement live trees were cored for the deter-
mination of age and past size. Seedling trees, those below
2.5 cm dbh, were tallied by species, condition, and height
class in a 50-m2 subplot.
Canopy cover measured by vertical projection (Ganey &
Block 1994) was recorded at each of the 332-point inter-
cept locations along two 50-m point intercept transects
along the outer plot edges. Forest floor and woody debris
were measured along four 15.24-m planar intersect trans-
ects (Brown 1974) placed in random directions every 10 m
along the plot centerline. Woody debris was recorded by
timelag/size classes described by Anderson (1982), where
the term timelag refers to the average time needed for the
debris to come into equilibrium with atmospheric moisture
content: 1-hr timelag (woody fuels .0 and ,0.64 cm in
diameter), 10-hr (0.642.54 cm), 100-hr (2.557.62 cm),
and 1,000-hr (.7.62 cm, divided into sound and rotten
categories). Litter (L layer, undecomposed material) and
duff (F and H layers, decomposing material or humus)
were measured every 1.52 m along each transect. Eight
photopoints were established at each plot from the corners
and quarter corners.
Laboratory Methods
Plot areas were corrected for slope. Tree increment cores
were surfaced and crossdated (Stokes & Smiley 1968) with
local tree-ring chronologies. Rings were counted on cores
that could not be crossdated, especially younger trees.
Additional years to the center were estimated with a pith
locator (concentric circles matched to the curvature and
density of the inner rings) for cores that missed the pith
(Applequist 1958). Fuel loadings were calculated from the
planar transect data (Brown 1974; Sackett 1980). Pre-settle-
ment forest structure was reconstructed at the time of dis-
ruption of the frequent fire regime, 1879 (Fule´ et al. 1997,
2002b). Tree size at the time of fire exclusion was recon-
structed for all living trees by subtracting the radial growth
measured on increment cores since fire exclusion. For dead
trees, the date of death was estimated based on tree condi-
tion class using diameter-dependent snag decomposition
rates (Thomas et al. 1979). To estimate the growth between
the fire exclusion date and death date, we developed local
species-specific relationships between tree diameter and
basal area increment (r2 5 0.45 to 0.90). An analogous

process of growth estimation was used to estimate the past
diameter of the small proportion of living pre-settlement
era trees for which an intact increment core could not be
extracted due to rot.
Assessment of fire effects is based on the assumption that
the burned and unburned sites were similar before burning,
because no pre-fire data exist. This assumption is reasonable
in light of the close proximity, shared management history,
and similar topography of the sites. Comparisons of forest
variables between sites were made with multivariate analysis
of variance (SYSTAT, SPSS, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.). Alpha
level was 0.05. Variables were square-root transformed
where necessary to meet ANOVA assumptions of normality
and homoscedasticity. Following a statistically significant
ANOVA result, treatment means were compared with a
post hoc Tukey’s test.
The Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) (Van Dyck 2000),
Central Rockies/Southwestern Ponderosa Pine variant, was
used to simulate stand development in the burned and
unburned sites for the next 50 years. Three different scenarios
were compared: (1) fire exclusion; (2) repeated prescribed
burning of the burn site; and (3) removal of aspen regenera-
tion to simulate severe browsing by ungulates. The prescribed
burning was simulated with the fire/fuels extension (FFE) to
FVS. Burns were set at 15-year intervals with wind speed at
8.5km/hr, dry fuel moisture level, and ambient temperature
18.3C. We chose the 15-year burning interval as a compro-
mise between the historical fire frequency (59 years) versus
budget and logistical constraints on management. An 8-year
interval was also tested for comparison. Severe ungulate
browsing occurred historically on the North Rim in the
1920s (Rasmussen 1941; Mitchell & Freeman 1993), and
exceptionally heavy browsing of aspen remains common in
forests with high elk populations (Dahms & Geils 1997; White
et al. 1998; Ripple & Larsen 2000). In contrast to most wes-
tern forests, elk have been absent from the North Rim for
most of the twentieth century, but a small herd has become
established recently (R. Sieg, Arizona Game and Fish Depart-
ment, personal communication, 2002).
Results
The burned site was significantly lower in tree density and
basal area than the unburned site (Table 2). Total tree den-
sity in the burn averaged 35% that of the unburned site, but
the density difference was predominantly in smaller diam-
eter trees, because the burn basal area was 69% that of
the unburned site. The reductions were concentrated in fire-
susceptible species. White fir and aspen were the two most
common species in the unburned site, making up 77% of tree
density, but these species made up only 48% of tree density
in burn. Fire-resistant ponderosa pine and Douglas fir aver-
aged somewhat lower in density and basal area in burn than
in the unburned site, but the differences were not statistically
significant. The maximum pine density at any plot, 594 trees/
ha, occurred in the burn. Pine made up 60% of the total basal
area in the burn but only comprised 48% of the basal area in
the unburned site. Engelmann spruce was encountered only
in the burn at low density (,12 trees/ha), and New Mexican
locust was encountered only in the unburned site, also at low
density (,6 trees/ha). Structural variability was greater in
the burn site, which included plots with no living trees. In
contrast, the minimum values of density and basal area at the
unburned site were 309 trees/ha and 18.5m2/ha, respectively.
The sites differed significantly in log density but not in snag
density. The burned site averaged 5.0 logs .30cm in diameter
per hectare and only 1.0 log .50cm in diameter per hectare,
significantly fewer than the 43.5 logs .30cm and 21.2 logs
.50cm in diameter per hectare in the unburned area. The
burned site averaged 63.3 snags .30cm in diameter per hec-
tare and 22.8 snags .50cm in diameter per hectare, not sig-
nificantly different fromthe averages of 45.1 snags .30cmand
24.3 snags .50cm in diameter per hectare in the unburned
area.
Canopy cover in the burn (30%) averaged less than half
the canopy cover in the unburned site (63.2%) (Table3).
Seven percent of sample plots in the burn had no canopy
cover and 50% of plots had canopy cover below 32%, which
was the minimum value of canopy cover in the unburned
site. Seedling or sprout densities (Table4) were nearly equal

across the two sites for the smallest size category (,30 cm
tall). Seedlings or sprouts between 30 and 200 cm were only
35% as dense in burn as in the unburned site, a ratio drop-
ping to 23% for regeneration .200 cm tall, but the differ-
ences were not statistically significant.
Forest floor litter was significantly higher in burn, but
duff was significantly lower (Table 5). All categories of fine
and coarse woody debris were significantly lower in burn,
except for large sound woody debris (1,000 hr), which was
nearly equal in both sites. Total woody debris was 87%
higher in the unburned site than in the burn.
Spatial patterns of forest structure showed strong con-
trasts between the sites (Fig. 1). Levels of structural vari-
ables
were
relatively
evenly
distributed
across
the
unburned site, but the lowest values of canopy cover,
duff depth, and tree density were grouped in the burn
(Fig. 2). The west side of the burn had five contiguous
plots with canopy cover ,15%. As a first approximation
of patch size, these aggregated plots represent an area of
45 ha or 30% of the study site. Three of these plots also
had basal area ,15 m2/ha, and four of these plots had a
density of ,100 trees/ha. In contrast, the highest values of
structural variables tended to occur on the east side of the
burn, but the pattern was less grouped and no distinct
patches of dense forest structure were evident. Regener-
ation density (seedlings and sprouts) had a distinctly different
pattern, with patches of dense regeneration occurring
sporadically across the landscape of both the burned and
the unburned sites.
The fate of old-growth trees is important both for their
ecological roles and for their importance in dendroecol-
ogical forest reconstruction. Because the sites have never
been harvested, a relatively high proportion of trees of
pre-1879 origin (old-growth) are still living: 43% of the
pre-1879 trees in the unburned site were alive in 1998.
However fewer old-growth trees were alive in the burn:
66.3 trees/ha compared to 107.9 trees/ha in the unburned
site. Most of the difference was in old-growth aspen, 3.7
and 39.5 trees/ha in burned and unburned sites, respec-
tively. Living old-growth ponderosa pine trees were nearly
equal in density, 53.9 and 50.9 trees/ha in burned and
unburned sites, respectively. The unburned and burned
sites were also similar in the density of old-growth snags
that died relatively recently (condition classes 3 through 5,
as defined in the Field Methods), 30.1 and 27.7 trees/ha,
respectively, as well as older or broken snags (condition
classes 6 and 7), 64.0 and 51.6 trees/ha, respectively. Den-
sity of downed old-growth trees was nearly three times
higher at the unburned site, however (52.2 trees/ha vs.
18.1 trees/ha in the burn).
Reconstructed forest structure in 1879, at the end of the
frequent fire regime, was significantly less dense in the
burned than the unburned site, but aspen was the only
individual species with a significant difference in recon-
structed density (Table 6). Tree density in the burned site
was 77% that of the unburned site; basal area was only
69%. As with the other variables measured in this study,
these
differences
might
represent
actual
differences
between the two sites or the effect of the fire in consuming
dead wood that is important for accurate forest reconstruc-
tion. Under the assumption that both sites were similar
before the fire, 17% of the burned site (five plots) had
current basal area values below the minimum basal area
value reconstructed in 1879 in the unburned site. Four of
these plots were contiguous, approximately representing a
patch of 36 ha (13% of the study site).
Simulated stand development for 50 years under the first
scenario, no fire, maintained high basal area at the
unburned site and caused basal area to increase to high
levels, greater than 40 m2/ha, in the burned site (Fig. 3). In
contrast repeated prescribed burning at a 15-year interval
maintained low basal area at the burned site, approxi-
mately 20 m2/ha. Repeated prescribed burning in the
unburned site was also predicted to result in low basal
area, approximately 23m2/ha. Burning at an 8-year interval

led to similar results but slightly lower basal area (data not
shown). In the third scenario, with aspen regeneration
removed, basal area in both the burned and unburned sites
reached high levels close to 40m2/ha, similar to the
first scenario. However the forest was increasingly dominated
by conifers as the aspen failed to regenerate: the propor-
tion of tree density made up by aspen dropped from 8 to
24% at the start of the simulation in the burned and
unburned sites, respectively, to ,4% in both sites after
50 years.
Discussion
Reliability and Consistency of Data
A central problem in fire ecology research is the scarcity of
replicated experimentation (Whelan 1995). In the present
study the burn was not randomly assigned or replicated,
and pre-burn data were not collected, constraining the
scope of inference. We assessed fire effects by comparing
the two sites under the assumption that the burned and
unburned sites were essentially equivalent before the fire,
allowing the unburned site to serve as a reference or con-
trol area. While this assumption is reasonable, there could
have been pre-existing differences between sites, and the
variability
of
effects
between
independent
fires
is
unknown, because the sampling plots in this study are
pseudoreplicates (van Mantgem et al. 2001). The study of
unreplicated perturbations is nonetheless valuable in cir-
cumstances where even limited information is needed for
management decisions (including the possible decision to
undertake an experiment) (Eberhardt & Thomas 1991).
A second issue related to data reliability is the direct
consumption of evidence of pre-1879 forest structure. The
reconstructed 1879 forest structure at the unburned site
was highly consistent with the data measured in the
earliest survey of the Kaibab Plateau, by Lang and Stewart
(1910) (Fule´ et al. 2002b). Under the assumption that
burned and unburned sites were similar before the fire,
approximately 34 dead and downed old-growth trees/hec-
tare may have been burned without trace, comprising
about 60% of the difference in reconstructed 1879 forest
structure between the sites. Tree evidence of past forest
structure was probably lost in all categories of dead trees
(snags and logs). The burned area had reconstructed forest
density amounting to 77% of the unburned density and
69% of the unburned basal area, suggesting that roughly
one-third
of
the
pre-1879
structural
evidence
was

destroyed by the fire. In a harvested forest, where much of
the evidence would have been in the form of dry and
decomposing stumps, the loss might have been proportion-
ally much greater. It would not be logical to address
Bonnicksen and Stone’s (1985: 479) challenge that ‘‘we
are burning the past in our National Parks’’ by trying to
prevent fire indefinitely, but there is a good basis to argue
that time is running out to capture important data on fire
regimes and forest structure, because the loss of dendro-
ecological evidence to fire and decay may ultimately lead to
greater uncertainty or even misinterpretation of the RNV.
Consistency is the third important issue associated with
the interpretation of this study: would another fire in simi-
lar forests burn in the exact same way? Probably not,

because the characteristics of canopy burning and spotting
are highly uncontrollable and unpredictable even to
experienced fire managers. Fires in similar North Rim
forests under similar prescriptions have spanned the
range from surface fire (e.g., the adjacent Northwest I
and Northwest II prescribed fires) to severe crownfire
(e.g., the Outlet escaped prescribed fire). However, while
the overall effects encountered in the burned site are
unlikely to be replicated precisely in another fire, the
range of effects provides a useful basis for assessing the
impact of intense burning and addressing the research
hypotheses.
Assessment of Alternative Hypotheses
In several important respects, the effects of the burn were
consistent with Miller and Urban’s (2000) hypothesis of
structural change toward RNV conditions after intense
burning. Quantitative reference data can be applied for
direct comparison with forest structure in the burn. Using
the reconstructed 1879 forest structure in the unburned
site as the point of comparison, post-burn tree density,
331 trees/ha, was within 1.2 standard deviations of the
density, 246 trees/ha. Average post-burn basal area was
identical to the 1879 value (28.5 m2/ha). Ponderosa pine
was the dominant species after the burn, comprising 41%
of tree density and 60% of basal area, compared to 54 and
75%, respectively, in the reconstructed forest. In contrast,
white fir was numerically dominant in the absence of fire
in the unburned site, and ponderosa pine made up ,50%
of basal area. Quadratic mean diameter averaged 33.1 cm
in the burn, close to the reconstructed value of 38.4 cm and
well above the unburned value of 23.6 cm. These differ-
ences suggest that fire-susceptible species and smaller trees
were preferentially killed in the burn. Post-burn conditions
of canopy cover and forest floor/woody debris were con-
sistent with the expectations of relatively open canopy
conditions (30%), thin duff layers (1.3 cm), and low levels
of rotten woody debris (13.6 Mg/ha).
These values can be compared to modern reference sites
at Powell Plateau and Rainbow Plateau, at slightly lower
elevation (approximately 2,300 m) on the rim of the Grand
Canyon where twentieth-century fire exclusion had mini-
mal impact: canopy cover averaged 49.1%, duff depth
1.9 cm, and rotten woody debris 3.7 Mg/ha (P. Z. Fule´
et al., unpublished data; Fule´ et al. 2002b). Finally, these
structural changes were accomplished without the negative
impacts usually associated with mechanical intervention:
roads, soil compaction, logging damage, and introduction
of exotic species. Instead, understory plant communities in
the burn were vigorous and nearly entirely composed of
natives (K. Huisinga 2000, Northern Arizona University,
personal communication).
Although the average conditions supported Miller and
Urban’s (2000) hypothesis, the variability in post-burn for-
est structure was greater than in 1879. The standard error of
the mean (SEM) for tree density, 57 trees/ha, was 4.4 times
greater than the SEM in 1879, 12.9 trees/ha. Similarly, the
SEM for post-burn basal area was 2.7 times higher than the

on dense forest structure in the absence of fire. Aspen regeneration
mortality led to increased conifer dominance. Only repeated burning

1879 value, 4.9 and 1.8 m2/ha, respectively. This variability
was spatially aggregated, especially in the relatively defor-
ested patches at the western end of the burn. As many as
90% of the old-growth aspens may have been killed by the
fire. These comparisons underscore the complexity of eval-
uating alternative forest structures in a restoration context.
Even though average post-burn values of forest density and
basal area were very similar to reference conditions at the
stand scale, habitats at finer scales may be very different.
The two bounding hypotheses—little effect of the fire
versus excessive fire severity—were supported to a limited
extent within the heterogeneous effects of the fire. Some
portions of the site had relatively little tree mortality, with
post-fire maximum density reaching 1,242 trees/ha, in con-
trast to the western side of the fire where heavy mortality
occurred. However, the patches of high mortality were
relatively small (one sample plot representing approxi-
mately 9 ha with complete mortality and seven plots repre-
senting approximately 63 ha of canopy cover ,15%) and
regeneration averaged over 2,800 seedlings or sprouts per
hectare on the low-canopy plots; hence there was no evi-
dence of large-scale conversion to a non-forest vegetation
type, as observed by Barton (2002) in southern Arizona.
Implications for Management
The future scenarios, contrasted with FVS simulation
modeling, illustrate the importance of active management
in restoration and conservation of southwestern forests.
The Northwest III fire caused a significant shift in forest
structure toward reference conditions, but the effects dis-
appeared within 50 years in the absence of fire. Recurring
fire, even at relatively long intervals, was projected to
maintain open forest characteristics. Like many other
U.S. land management agencies, Grand Canyon National
Park has an active policy of ‘‘wildland fire use for resource
benefits,’’ under which lightning-ignited fires can be
allowed to burn within certain constraints. However it is
relatively unlikely that the burned site would be re-burned
exclusively with naturally ignited fires that are allowed to
spread. The area remains surrounded by dense forest with
heavy fuel loads along the park boundary, a location of
special sensitivity to Park Service managers (Pyne 1989),
making it difficult for managers to allow lightning fires to
burn. Therefore, intentional prescribed burning of the
burned site should be a high priority. When aspen regen-
eration was removed, simulating the effect of elk herbiv-
ory, the proportion of aspen dropped to unprecedented
levels (,4%) within 50 years (aspen comprised 28% of
trees in the reconstructed forest), but total basal area still
rose to high levels.
The Northwest III fire marked an important turning
point in forest management at Grand Canyon National
Park. Pyne et al. (1996) outlined a historical series of
‘‘problem fire types’’ that forced paradigm shifts in Amer-
ican fire policy at approximately 20-year intervals. For
example, the Wilderness fire era of the 1970s and 1980s
was a period of prescribed burning and prescribed natural
fire (a policy of allowing some lightning-ignited fires to
burn), which underwent serious reconsideration after the
Yellowstone fires of 1988. At Grand Canyon, the North-
west III fire was the realization of earlier predictions
(Davis 1981) that fuel loads on the North Rim were too
high for consistent control by prescribed burning. A post-
fire review concluded that some level of mechanical treat-
ment was a useful option (Nichols et al. 1994), facilitating
an experiment to test combinations of thinning and burn-
ing on the North and South Rims (Covington et al. 1997).
Evaluating the results from the first treatment block in this
experiment, Fule´ et al. (2002a) recommended that tree
thinning could be used along roads and boundaries in the
park to create defensible fire buffers, permitting fires in
the interior of burn blocks to burn with greater intensity.
In retrospect, the present study has suggested that the
effects of the Northwest III fire were broadly consistent
with restoration of RNV conditions. Deliberate use of
intense burning will likely always pose a greater challenge
for managers than underburning, because of the greater
risk of escape and the perception that the burning may
damage the forest. But administrative and public support
can be enhanced if careful measurement of ecological
effects shows that such burning can meet restoration
goals. In remote settings like Grand Canyon, large-scale
management tests of intense prescribed fire within secure
boundaries may prove to be a more fruitful direction for
adaptive management experimentation than continuing
attempts to underburn dense, fire-excluded forests.
