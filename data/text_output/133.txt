07/16/2002 
Wallace Covington, director of the Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona 
University, will be on Capitol Hill today to give testimony before a Senate committee 
about the need to increase the pace and size of forest restoration treatments.  
Covington's testimony will focus on the implementation of the National Fire Plan. He 
says that, so far, the Fire Plan has not resulted in the implementation of large-scale, 
comprehensive restoration treatments that are required to prevent catastrophic fire.  
Covington is scheduled to testify at the Senate committee hearing at 11:30 a.m., Arizona 
time. The hearing is expected to be broadcast on CSPAN.
