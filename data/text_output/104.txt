container stock 
can be outplanted 
without thawing

A B ST RACT 
In this study, we outplanted frozen-stored container stock in 
operational settings and found minimal effects of thawing 
regime on seedling performance over 2 y. We monitored the 
performance of 1+0 container stock of 3 coniferous species 
(lodgepole pine [Pinus contotta var. latifolia (Pinaceae)], western 
larch [Larix occidentalis (Pinaceae)], and interior spruce [Picea 
glauco and P. engelmannii hybrid complex (Pinaceae)]) planted 
with frozen or thawed root plugs at 2 sites. Differences in 
chlorophyllfluorescence between frozen and thawed seedlings 
disappeared within 3 d of outplanting, and differences in bud­
burst phenology disappeared within 6 wk of outplanting. 
Frozen seedlings had slightly lower diameter and biomass than 
thawed seedlings but did not differ in condition, height, or stur­
diness ratio over 2 growing seasons. Interspecific and environ­
mental differences accounted for much more of the variation in 
measured attributes than did plug temperature treatment. 
Eliminating the thaw stage from the seedling production 
process can yield significant operational advantages.

NOMENCLATURE 
USDA NRCS (2004) 
P
rompt refore station is critical in ensuring the sus­
tainability of forestry in harvested areas and is valu­
able for restoring ecosystem health following crown 
fire or other natural disturbances. Many plants used 
in reforestation are produced in nurseries, where seedling  
quality and performance are optimized through control over  
tree size, root-to-shoot ratio, nutrient status, and health.  
Seedling quality and vigor can be affected by many aspects of  
the seedling production process, including harvest. storage.  
thawing regime, transportation, and outplanting technique  
(McKay 1997). Much attention has focused on determining  
when to harvest seedlings and how long to store them  
(Kozlowski and Pallardy 2002). Seedlings are often stored at  
below-freezing temperatures (- 2°C [28 OF]; the conventional  
practice in British Columbia) or at above-freezing temperatures  
(2 to 4 °C [36 to 39 OF)). Doing so provides flexibility in sched­ 
uling delivery to outplanting sites (Rose and Haase 1997).  
Frozen storage offers several advantages over cool storage, 
including reduced loss of carbohydrate reserves (Ritchie 1982; 
Wang and Zwiazek 2001), maintenance of cold hardiness 
(Schaberg and others 1996). and diminished likelihood of 
storage molds (Sutherland and others 1989). Seedlings are 
packaged into bundles before entering frozen storage. Con­
ventional bundling techniques wrap a number of container 
seedlings together, causing the root plugs to freeze together.

Before outplanting, these seedlings must be thawed so that they 
can be separated without damaging their root plugs. Technolo­
gies are now available to package seedlings individually so that 
they can be separated while frozen. Elimination of the thaw stage 
from the seedling production process would streamline the 
operation and improve the logistics of seedling delivery. 
Recent studies have demonstrated that conifer seedlings can 
tolerate a variety of thawing practices (Rose and Haase 1997; 
Maki and Colombo 2001). Many studies have shown that 
seedlings with frozen plugs (frozen seedlings) can be planted 
directly into the ground with little effect on short-term physi­
ology or first-year growth (Camm and others 1995; Pleistad 
and Kohmann 2001; Kooistra and Bakker 2002). A few studies 
have reported some negative effects of rapid thawing (Helenius 
and others 2004; Helenius 2005), though positive effects have 
also been demonstrated (Silim and Guy 1998). Overall, these 
results suggest that seedling health and survival are minimally 
affected by whether thawing occurs before outplanting. 
The study by Kooistra and Bakker (2002) was conducted in a 
nursery environment, which is substantially different from the 
environments into which seedlings are outplanted operationally. 
For example, the seedbed received uniform site preparation, and 
seedlings were irrigated and fertilized. In addition, soils were 
warmer (I8 to 32 °C [64 to 90 OF]) at the time of outplanting 
than is usually experienced operationally in northerly latitudes. 
In this study, we extend the results of Kooistra and Bakker 
(2002) to operational settings. We used frozen and thawed con­
tainer stock of 3 coniferous species, replicated the experiment at 
2 sites, and monitored seedling performance for 2 growing sea­
sons after outplanting.Wewere particularly interested in the rel­
ative magnitude of the effect due to plug temperature compared 
with the effects of species identity and large- and small-scale 
environmental differences among sites and blocks. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Experimental Design 
Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Doug!. ex. Loud. var. latifolia 
Engelm. ex S. Wats. [Pinaceae]: seedlot 60151), western larch 
(Larix occidentalis Nutt. [Pinaceae]; seedlot 60717), and inte­
rior spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss and P. engelmannii 
Parry ex Engelm. hybrid complex [Pinaceae] : seedlot 60148) 
1+0 seedlings were grown using standard operational methods 
in 80-ml (5-in 3) containers (Styroblock" 410 for larch, Cop­
perblockr?' 410 for pine and spruce; containers produced by 
Beaver Plastics, Edmonton, Alberta). In fall 2001, seedlings 
were harvested, graded, bundled in groups of IS, boxed, and 
placed in frozen storage at -2°C (28 OF). During bundling, 
a layer of nursery grade plastic wrap was placed between 
the seedlings in each bundle so that they could be separated 
268 
while frozen. 
In spring 2002, root growth capacity (RGC) was measured 
for 30 seedlings per species using Burdett's (1979) index of 
root growth. RGC was significantly lower for spruce than for 
larch and pine (mean values of 3.9, 4.7, and 4.6, respectively), 
but RGC values >2 are considered viable for operational pur­
poses in British Columbia (Kooistra, unpublished data). 
Bundles were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 plug temperature 
treatments in spring 2002: seedlings were outplanted either 
with thawed root plugs (thawed seedlings ) or with frozen root 
plugs (frozen seedlings). Seedlings for the thawed treatment 
were held for 5 d at 10 to 15°C (50 to 59 OF) before outplant­
ing. Frozen seedlings were kept in the freezer until outplanting. 
All seedlings were kept in the dark in the freezer and/or cooler. 
The field portion of the experiment was conducted at 2 sites 
(South Fork and Styx Creek) 60 km (37 mil apart in the inte­
rior Douglas-fir (IDF) biogeoclimatic zone, moist warm vari­
ant (mwl). Both sites are on crown land in Riverside Forest 
Products' operating area in the southern interior of British 
Columbia. South Fork is located on a northeast aspect at 1230 
m (4035 ft) elevation and was clear-cut harvested in winter 
2002. Styx Creek is located on a southwest aspect at 1090 m 
(3575 ft) elevation and was clear-cut harvested in autumn 
2000. Sites did not receive any site preparation but were fenced 
to prevent grazing and trampling by livestock. Soils at both 
sites are brunisols with a restrictive layer at about 35 em (1.1 ft) 
and a mor humus form . South Fork has silty loam to loamy 
sand soils with 50% coarse fragments, while Styx Creek has 
loamy sand soils with 25% coarse fragments (Riverside Forest 
Products, unpublished data). 
A portable weather station recorded temperature and pre­
cipitation at each site during the 2002 growing season. Precip­
itation from June to September 2002 was 62.4 mm (2.5 in) at 
Styx Creek and 24.7 mm (1.0 in) at South Fork. Logistical con­
straints prevented us from maintaining the weather stations 
during the 2003 growing season, but the region experienced 
drought conditions both years. 
At each site, the experiment had a randomized complete 
block design with 9 blocks and 6 treatment combinations (3 
species x 2 plug temperature treatments). Each treatment com­
bination consisted of a bundle of 15 seedlings outplanted in a 
row. Rows were 2.5 m (8.2 ft) apart, and seedlings within each 
row were 0.5 m (1.6 ft) apart. A total of 810 seedlings (9 blocks 
x 6 treatment combinations x 15 seedlings/bundle) were out­
planted at each site. Frozen seedlings were kept in coolers prior 
to outplanting while thawed seedlings were kept in the cartons 
used by the BC Ministry of Forests to ship seedlings to out­
planting locations around the province. Seedlings were out­
planted by 1 person at Styx Creek and 2 people at South Fork. 
The Styx Creek site was outplanted on 15 May 2002 between 
0900 and 1400 hours. Air temperatures at the time of outplanting 
were 7 to 12°C (45 to 54 OF), and the sky was overcast with sunny 
breaks. The South Fork site was outplanted on 24 May 2002

between 0900 and 1200 hours. Air temperatures at the time of 
outplanting were 8 to 12 °C (46 to 54 of), and the sky was partly 
cloudy.Outplanting occurred near the end ofthe typical planting 
season for this biogeoclimatic zone (MoF 1998). In particular, 
envirorunental constraints (snow on site) prevented earlier out­
planting at South Fork; the recent snowmelt resulted in much 
wetter soils at the time of outplanting than at Styx Creek. 
Warming Trends 
We examined the temperatures of seedling root plugs (Tp) 
and the soil (T5) using a method modified slightly from that of 
Kooistra and Bakker (2002). Tp was measured by placing a 
temperature probe at a s-cm (2-in) depth between 2 out­
planted seedlings held together by elastics. We used 2 probes 
per treatment combination in each of 3 blocks, for a total of 36 
probes per site. Readings were taken every 15 min for at least 7 
h after planting. After the temperature measurements were 
complete, the elastics were removed and seedlings replanted 
separately. Tp did not differ among species or blocks (data not 
shown ), so the mean Tp was calculated for each plug tempera­
ture treatment in each site. 
Soil temperature (T5) was measured at a s-cm (2-in ) depth 
with 1 probe in each block where Tp was measured. Measure­
ments were made at IS-min intervals. The temperature differ­
ence (Td) between the soil and root plugs was calculated as: 
o 
reeve 
y 
ree 
tesaie 
For frozen seedlings, this temperature difference is negative 
and rises toward zero as the root plug thaws. For thawed 
seedlings , the temperature difference is smaller and may be 
positive or negative. 
Seedling Performance 
Seedling performance was followed for 2 growing seasons 
after outplanting. Variables used to assess performance 
included chlorophyll fluorescence, budburst phenological 
stage, seedling condition, and growth parameters. Seedlings 
used to assess warming trends did not differ from other 
seedlings in performance measures (data not shown) and were 
included in all analyses. 
Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements provide a rapid, 
nondestructive physiological test of a seedling's photosyn­
thetic capacity (Binder and others 1997; Maki and Colombo 
2001; Rose and Haase 2002). Fluorescence measurements 
compare the basic fluorescence in the dark with the maximum 
fluorescence when exposed to a saturating light (Fv/Fm) and 
are reported as quantum yield. We used an EARS-PPM fluo­
rometer (EARS, Delft, The Netherlands) with a modulated 
(7.2 kHz ) 637 nm light to measure fluorescence and a = 1800 
W/m 2 saturating light (Anonymous 1993). At each site, fluo­
rescence measurements were taken on the top third of the

ures MANOVA to assess the overall effects of site, species, and 
plug temperature treatment as well as changes in these factors 
over time. Significant MANOVA results were followed by uni­
variate ANOVA tests to identify the response variables in which 
significant differences existed. We treated site, species, and plug 
temperature as fixed factors in the analyses. Blocks were treated 
as a random factor nested within sites and used as the error term 
to test the site effect. For factors with > 2 levels, Fisher's LSD was 
used to identify which levels differed significantly. 
Budburst phenological stage and seedling condition are 
nominal variables and could not be analyzed using ANOVA. 
Instead, we used contingency analysis to determine whether 
the proportions of seedlings in each category varied among 
sites, species, and plug temperature treatments. These analyses 
used seedlings from all blocks to ensure adequate sample sizes 
and were repeated for each assessment date. 
All analyses were conducted using IMP software (version 
5.1.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina) with a =0.05. 
RESULTS 
Warming Trends 
Soil temperatures ranged from 6 to 11°C (43 to 52 OF) at 
South Fork (mean = 8 °C [46 OF]), and from 8 to 13°C (46 to 55 
OF) at Styx Creek (mean = 10 °C [50 OF]). Root plugs of thawed 
seedlings were within 4 °C (7 OF) of soil temperatures at the time 
of outplanting (Figure I). At South Fork, the warming trend of 
thawed seedlings was best described as a linear function of time 
since outplanting with a slight positive slope. At Styx Creek, a 
third order polynomial function fit the data best. The fit lines 
were always within 2 °C (4 OF) of soil temperature. 
Root plugs of frozen seedlings were cooler than the soil at the 
time of outplanting and exhibited lags before their temperatures 
began to rise (Figure I). The warming trends at both sites were 
best described as third order polynomial functions of time since 
outplanting. The initial temperature difference (Td) was greater 
and root plugs warmed faster at South Fork than Styx Creek. 
The fit lines were within 2 °C (3.6 OF) of soil temperature after 
about 5 h at South Fork and 7 h at Styx Creek. 
Seedling Performance: Chlorophyll Fluorescence 
Chlorophyll fluorescence varied between plug temperature 
treatments (F= 8.01, P = 0.006), species (F = 509.85, P < 0.001), 
and sites (F = 34.30, P < 0.001). In addition, interactions of time 
with plug temperature treatment, species, site, the species x plug 
temperature interaction, and the site x species interaction were 
significant (P :s 0.01). Fluorescence values were significantly 
lower for frozen than thawed seedlings for the first 2 nights after 
outplanting and tended to be lower for frozen seedlings on the 
third night (F = 2.87, P = 0.094) but did not differ between plug 
temperature treatments on subsequent nights (Figure 2). Fluo-

Seedling Performance:  
Budburst Phenology and Seedling Condition  
Plug temperature had a significant effect on budburst for 3 
wk after outplanting, as thawed seedlings advanced in phenol­
ogy faster than frozen seedlings (Figure 3). The magnitude of 
the plug temperature effect diminished over time (4-d: X2 = 
199.6, P < 0.001 ; I-wk: X2 = 142.6, P < 0.001; 3-wk: X2 = 19.1, 
P < 0.00 I), and was undetectable after 6 wk (X2 = 2.5, P = 
0.48I). The effect of plug temperature treatment on phenology 
was more pronounced for larch than for pine or spruce. 
Budburst differed significantly among species and sites. 
Larch advanced in phenological stage faster than pine or spruce, 
and more pine seedlings were dead or damaged than larch or 
spruce seedlings (Figure 3). Seedlings at South Fork advanced 
faster than those at Styx Creek, though the proportion of dead 
or damaged seedlings was also higher at South Fork after 6 wk.

as "good" (Table 2) and seedling condition did not vary among

plug temperature treatments, species, or sites. After 2 growing 
seasons, seedling condition still did not vary between plug tem­
perature treatments (X.z = 2.1, P = 0.714) but varied among 
species (X2 = 40.9, P < 0.001) and sites (Table 2). Mortality was 
highest in larch, and more pine seedlings were assessed as "fair" 
than for other species. These differences were especially pro­
nounced at South Fork, so seedlings were assessed to be in better 
condition at Styx Creek (X2 = 33.4, P < 0.001). 
Mean survival was 99% after 1 growing season and 96% 
274 
after 2 growing seasons. Larch accounted for 57% of the mor­
tality, spruce for 29%, and pine for 14%. Interim visits to assess 
seedling condition indicated that mortality occurred during 
the winter (due to rodent herbivory) and during July droughts 
in both growing seasons. 
Seedling Performance: Growth Parameters 
Seedling height did not vary between plug temperature 
treatments (F =0.42, P = 0.517) but varied among species (F= 
215.09, P < 0.001) and blocks (F = 1.78, P = 0.049), and with 
the site x species interaction (F = 5.48, P = 0.006). Interactions 
of time with species and with the site x species interaction 
were significant (P < 0.001) but the interaction with plug tem­
perature treatment was not (F = 0.05, P = 0.955). Larch grew 
the most, and spruce the least (Figure 4). Height growth 
varied more between sites for larch than for pine or spruce, 
resulting in significant site x species interactions in both 
growing seasons. 
Seedling stem diameter varied between plug temperature 
treatments (F= 5.21, P =0.025) but varied much more among 
species (F = 88.36, P < 0.001), sites (F =47.43, P < 0.001), and 
blocks (F =4.29, P < 0.001). The site x species interaction was 
also significant (F = 3.18, P= 0.047). Interactions of time with 
species, block, and the site x species interaction were signifi­
cant (P < 0.02) but the interaction with plug temperature 
treatment was not (F = 2.28, P = 0.109). At the end of the sec­
ond growing season , mean stem diameter was 0.6 mm (0.02 
in) smaller for frozen than thawed seedlings (Figure 4). In 
comparison, mean second-year stem diameters varied 4.2 mm 
(0.17 in) between sites, 4.0 mm (0.16 in) among species, and 
7.9 mm (0.31 in) among blocks. Stem diameter growth 
varied more between sites for larch than for pine or spruce, 
resulting in a significant site x species interaction in the second 
growing season . 
Seedling biomass differed slightly between plug tempera­
ture treatments (F = 3.20, P = 0.078) but varied much more 
among species (F= 10.18, P < 0.001) and blocks (F = 3.15, P < 
0.001), and with the site x species interaction (F = 6.55, P = 
0.002). Interactions of time with block, species, and the site x 
species interaction were significant (P < 0.001). At the end of 
the first growing season, mean biomass was 0.29 g lower for 
frozen than thawed seedlings (Figure 4). In comparison, mean 
biomass varied as much as 0.77 g among species and 2.37 g 
among blocks. 
Seedling sturdiness ratio (SR) did not vary between plug 
temperature treatments (F = 0.79, P = 0.376) but varied 
among species (F= 73.31, P< 0.001) and sites (F= 105.38, P < 
0.001). Interactions of time with species, site, and the site x 
species interaction were significant but the interaction with 
plug temperature was not. SR was significantly lower at South 
Fork than Styx Creek (Figure 5) and was lowest for pine.

DISCUSSION 
Warming Trends 
Soils at these sites were cooler than in the study by Kooistra 
and Bakker (2002), and root plugs of frozen seedlings took 
longer to approach soil temperature (Figure 1). These lags in 
warming are attributed to the heat absorbed by water within 
frozen root plugs as it changes state from a solid to a liquid. The 
rate of thawing in frozen root plugs is inversely related to the soil 
temperature: less latent heat is available in cooler soils so thaw­
ing occurs at a lower rate and more time must elapse before 
roots can become physiologically active. If frozen seedlings were 
planted in near-freezing soils, the amount of time required for 
thawing to occur could be more substantial. The cool soil tem­
peratures at these sites have temporary effects on the plants 
because soil warms during the summer. In boreal sites, plant 
growth, particularly belowground, can be reduced by soils that 
remain cool for the entire growing season (Helenius 2005). 
Plug temperatures were measured using paired seedlings, so 
the warming trends reported here underestimate the rate at 
which the root plugs of individual seedlings thaw. Single root 
plugs contain less ice and have higher surface area to volume 
ratios and therefore warm more rapidly than the paired root 
plugs used in this study. The 80-ml plug volume used in this 
experiment is one of the most common sizes used in British 
Columbia, though root plug volumes used operationally range 
from 65 to 340 ml (4 to 21 in3) (MoF 1998). Larger root plugs 
take longer to warm (Kooistra and Bakker 2002) . 
Seedling Performance 
Frozen and thawed seedlings differed physiologically before 
and immediately after outplanting, though these differences

rapidly disappeared. Fluorescence values were lower for frozen 
than thawed seedlings (Figure 2), reflecting the more rapid 
photosynthetic activation of thawed seedlings . Larch exhibited 
lower fluorescence values in this study than in an earlier study 
in a nursery setting (Kooistra and Bakker 2002), though values 
were up to the range reported in the earlier study after 4 nights. 
Fluorescence values for pine were roughly equivalent with 
those from the nursery study, while values for spruce began 
higher in this study than in the nursery study. By the end of the 
measurement period, fluorescence values were within the 
range observed for conifer seedlings (Nippert and others 2004; 
Ritchie and Landis 2005; CM Kooistra, personal observation), 
though larch values were slightly lower because the foliage had 
not finished its spring growth. 
Fluorescence measurements are a valuable way of rapidly 
assessing the physiological status of a seedling (Binder and 
others 1997; Rose and Haase 2002). For example, fluorescence 
measurements at Styx Creek declined for the first 3 nights fol­
lowing outplanting (Figure 2), likely in response to drying site 
conditions. The soils at Styx Creek are shallow and were dry at 
outplanting, and it did not rain until 4 d after planting, after 
which the fluorescence values of all species rose. The dry con­
ditions at Styx Creek may also explain the more rapid pheno­
logical development of seedlings at South Fork (Figure 3). 
Seedling phenology was also strongly affected by plug temper­
ature treatment. In particular, thawed larch seedlings advanced in 
phenology more rapidly than frozen seedlings (Figure 3), as was 
shown in an earlier nursery study (Kooistra and Bakker 2002) and 
is frequently observed operationally. The rapid phenological 
development of thawed larch seedlings predisposes them to 
injury, particularly to damaged swollen buds during transport 
and to solarization of foliagethat flushes in closed cartons prior to

Figure5. Sturdiness ratio (mean ± SO) of frozen (filled symbols) and thawed (open symbols) seedlings of larch (circles, solid lines), pine (triangles, 
dotted lines), and spruce (squares, dashed lines) outplanted at South Fork (left) and Styx Creek (right) . Sturdiness ratios were calculated at the time

outplanting. The slower phenological development of frozen 
larch seedlings is therefore advantageous from an operational per­
spective. Similarly, Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) 
seedlings that are rapidly thawed break bud slower (Helenius 
2005) and maintain higher freezing tolerance (Fleistad and 
Kohmann 2001) than seedlings that are slowlythawed. The slower 
phenological development of rapidly thawed seedlings could be 
advantageous when outplanting in the early spring or in areas 
with a risk of late frosts. 
The effects of plug temperature treatment on phenology 
were short-lived: we observed no differences in phenological 
stage between frozen and thawed seedlings of any species 6 wk 
after outplanting (Figure 3). Two years after outplanting, 
seedlings from both plug temperature treatments were thriv­
ing, and > 85% of seedlings were rated as "good" (Table 2). As 
in a previous study (Kooistra and Bakker 2002), larch com ­
prised the majority of seedlings that died. Compared to the 
other species, pine was in the best condition at Styx Creek but 
the worst condition at South Fork (Table 2). 
Significant site x species interactions indicate that species 
responded differently to environmental conditions at the 2 
sites. In particular, larch exhibited more variation in growth 
parameters between sites than the other species (Figures 4, 5). 
Larch also shows a greater response than pine to different 
watering regimes (Kooistra and Bakker 2002). Pine grew as tall 
or taller on these sites as it did in a seedling nursery at a lower 
elevation (Kooistra and Bakker 2002) where conditions were 
warmer and drier than lodgepole pine prefers. 
Plug temperature treatment caused a small but significant 
276 
reduction in seedling stem diameter and biomass (Figure 4) but 
no effect on sturdiness ratio (Figure 5). Biomass and sturdiness 
ratio both integrate height and stem diameter, but biomass is 
more affected by stern diameter than height (Table l) whereas SR 
weights them equally. Plug temperature treatment had no effect 
on seedling height in this study (Figure 4), whereas Helenius and 
others (2004) reported that rapid thawing (7 h at 12 °C [54 of]) 
negativelyaffected height growth in the first 2 yearsat I of 2 sites. 
Overall, much more of the variation in growth parameters was 
attributable to interspecific differences and to large- and small­
scale environmental differences (that is, differences among sites 
and blocks) than to plug temperature treatment. Similar results 
are evident in other published studies: Fleistad and Kohmann 
(2001) report differences between seedlots in frost hardiness and 
bud break, and Helenius and others (2004) indicate that seedling 
height after 3 y differed by about 10em between sitesbut by about 
5 em between thawing regimes within sites.Environmental differ­
ences willbe increasingly expressed in the growth and phenology 
of seedlings and will further mask initial differences attributable 
to nursery culture (Grossnickle and Folk 2003). Even differences 
in stock type have less of an effect on seedlings than differences 
among outplanting locations (Jones and others 2002; Campbell 
and others 2003). 
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS 
Seedlings outplanted with frozen root plugs took several hours 
to thaw and warm to soil temperature. Fluorescence measure­
ments indicated that seedlings outplanted with thawed root 
plugs were functioning at a higher level of physiological activ-

ity than those outplanted with frozen root plugs, though this 
difference disappeared within 3 d of outplanting. Frozen 
seedlings advanced in budburst phenology slower than thawed 
seedlings. Over 2 growing seasons, frozen seedlings had slightly 
lower stem diameter and biomass than thawed seedlings, but 
condition, height, and sturdiness ratio did not differ between 
plug temperature treatments. Interspecific and environmental 
differences accounted for much more of the variation in meas­
ured attributes than did plug temperature treatment. 
This study demonstrated that seedlings of western larch, 
lodgepole pine , and interior spruce are tolerant of being out­
planted with frozen root plugs. Packaging seedlings individu­
ally before frozen storage and removing the thawing stage from 
the seedling production process would provide significant 
operational advantages with respect to cold storage manage­
ment, coordination of transportation to planting sites, and the 
logistics of planting operations.
