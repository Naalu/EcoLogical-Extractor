ABSTRACT 
LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF STAND-REPLACING WILDFIRES ON NUTRIENT 
CYCLING AND DECOMPOSITION IN SOUTHWESTERN PONDEROSA PINE 
FORESTS 
Valerie J. Kurth 
The frequency and size of stand-replacing wildfires in the western U.S. has 
increased in recent years as a result of complex interacting factors, including 
increased temperatures, drought frequency, and the build-up of forest fuels from a 
century of fire suppression. Stand-replacing fires are a relatively novel disturbance 
in southwestern ponderosa pine forests, so the long-term ecosystem consequences 
of this type of fire are uncertain. The objective of the research presented here is to 
improve our understanding of post-fire ecosystem functioning by examining 
controls on carbon (C) accumulation and release patterns from several different 
perspectives. The first study addresses post-fire nitrogen (N) cycling dynamics 
because N availability is a limiting factor to net primary productivity in these 
forests, so it may be critical to post-fire carbon accumulation. I quantified rates of 
net and gross nitrogen (N) mineralization and nitrification in burned and paired 
unburned forests representing a range of fire ages (2-34 years). The results 
demonstrate that fire effects on N cycling can persist for decades, and support the 
hypothesis that post-fire vegetation drives ecosystem processes such as N cycling. 
The second study examines communities of wood-decay fungi as a potential control 
on post-fire C release as C02 from decomposing wood. I identified the community 
structure of wood-decay fungi in burned and paired unburned forest representing a

range of burn years (2005,2000, 1996, 1984, and 1977). The results suggest that 
fire reduces species richness for up to 4 years, and it alters species composition for 
up to 32 years. However, composition was accompanied by substantial 
heterogeneity in both burned and unburned sites. A companion experiment using a 
subset of the fungal species demonstrated that fungi differ in their abilities to 
decompose wood, which may have implications for fungal succession and wood 
decomposition rates. The third study addresses the effect of wildfire and two 
common management treatments (thinning and thinning/burning) on the 
decomposition of fine roots over a 27-month period. Although I did not observe a 
significant effect of forest treatment, the overall decomposition rates of fine roots 
were faster than those of comparable leaf litter. This observation, coupled with the 
relatively high nutrient content of fine roots, suggests that fine root turnover is an 
integral part of maintaining soil fertility in these ecosystems. The overall results of 
these three studies have dual implications for forest management in this region. 
First, to maintain forested landscapes, managers should implement treatments (e.g., 
thinning) that reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire. Second, managers should 
prepare for this type of wildfire by prioritizing resources (e.g., watersheds, habitat, 
recreation) and anticipating post-wildfire ecosystem recovery.

CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION 
Recent alterations in global climate patterns, including increasing mean 
temperatures and drought severity, have the potential to alter natural disturbance 
regimes, as well as the direction of the post-disturbance ecosystem response 
(Savage and Mast 2005, Marshall et al. 2008). Severe drought conditions can trigger 
sudden and large-scale mortality events (Breshears et al. 2005), and are correlated 
with the rising frequency and amount of area burned by wildfires in the western u.S. 
(Westerling et al. 2003, Westerling et al. 2006). In particular, stand-replacing 
wildfires have long-term effects on ecosystem functioning, but specific post-fire 
recovery patterns are difficult to predict given the innate complexities within 
climate change and land management practices (Beschta et al. 2004, Marshall et al. 
2008, Williams et al. 2010). However, given that drought frequency and intensity 
are predicted to rise in the future (Seager et al. 2007; Easterling et al. 2003; Hoerling 
and Kumar 2003), we may expect to continue on the trajectory of more frequent 
stand-replacing wildfires. Therefore, it has become increasingly important to 
understand forest ecosystem response to these large-scale disturbances in order to 
provide appropriate information to land managers (Beschta et al. 2004). 
Ponderosa pine forests of the southwestern u.S. are sensitive to drought 
conditions and increasing mean temperatures (Williams et al. 2010). This sensitivity 
means that they are more likely to suffer from tree mortality due to water stress, 
and have higher susceptibility to mortality from more frequent bark beetle 
outbreaks and wildfires. Wildfires are of particular interest because of their ability

to rapidly alter ecosystem properties; specifically, fires combust large amounts of 
organic matter stored in living and dead plant biomass and release it to the 
atmosphere rapidly (Hurteau and Brooks 2011). Fires also lead to changes in 
microclimate, the deposition of nutrients in ash, a prolonged pulse of inorganic 
nitrogen (N), increased soil pH, and the potential to alter both plant and microbial 
community structure (Raison 1979, Neary et a1. 1999, Hart et a1. 2005). 
Furthermore, natural regeneration is often limited in southwestern ponderosa pine 
forests (Heidmann 2008), which gives rise to potential shifts in the overall 
vegetation community following stand-replacing wildfires, including changes to 
alternative stable states such as grassland or shrubland (Savage and Mast 2005). 
Southwestern ponderosa pine forests are uniquely suited to studying post-
wildfire ecosystem functioning for several reasons. First, these forests are 
widespread in the Southwest, comprising almost half of the commercial forested 
land in Arizona, Utah, New Mexico and Colorado (Schubert 1974). The land-use 
history of this region strongly influenced the wildfire regime, specifically a shift 
from low-intensity surface fires to stand-replacing wildfires since Euro-American 
settlement circa 1880 (Covington and Moore 1994). The historic fire regime was 
frequent, low intensity surface fires that maintained forests in an open structure 
with prolific understory vegetation. The introduction of land management practices, 
such as livestock grazing, timber harvest, and fire suppression by Euro-American 
settlers beginning in the late 1800s has led to a build-up of small diameter trees and 
an associated fire regime shift to infrequent, stand-replacing wildfires (Cooper 
1960, Covington et a1. 1997). Finally, research in this ecosystem is relevant to other

forests in the western U.S. because these land management practices, especially 
active fire suppression, are similarly applied across the region. 
The research in this dissertation uses southwestern ponderosa pine forests 
as a model ecosystem to examine post-wildfire ecosystem response from several 
different angles, all under the overarching them of carbon (C) and N cycling. In doing 
so, I hoped to gain a broad, but compelling perspective on post-wildfire ecosystem 
functioning. 
The research in Chapter Three explores changes in N cycling dynamics over 
time since stand-replacing wildfire using in situ measurements of net N 
transformations and laboratory measurements of gross N production. Nitrogen, as 
well as water, is limiting to net primary productivity in southwestern ponderosa 
pine forests (Wagle and Kitchen 1972, Heidmann et al. 1979); thus, its availability to 
plant growth may constrain post-fire net primary production (Le., C accumulation). 
Nitrogen transformations are strongly affected by wildfire, but the effects of stand-
replacing wildfire on N cycling in these forests have rarely been assessed (Grady 
and Hart 2006). Severe fires combust substantial amounts of the organically bound 
N, but fires also create a pulse of plant-available N, in the form of pyrogenically 
produced NH4+(White 1986, Covington and Sackett 1992, Wan et al. 2001, 
Smithwick et al. 2005). The fates ofthis NH4+ include: plant uptake, microbial 
assimilation (immobilization), fixation within clays, loss due to surface erosion, and 
conversion into N01- (Johnson 1992), another form of plant-available inorganic N. 
Nitrification rates are typically enhanced for 1-2 years after fire because there is 
abundant NH4+ substrate, plant uptake of NH4+ is typically low, and microclimatic

conditions, especially elevated pH and soil temperatures, are favorable for nitrifying 
bacteria (Raison 1979, Covington and Sackett 1992, Prieto-Fernandez et al. 2004, 
Turner et al. 2007). As burned areas become re-vegetated, demand for N from 
plants and microbes increases, resulting in an observed decline in nitrification rates. 
The temporal aspect of these processes is important because the majority of 
our knowledge concerning fire effects in southwestern ponderosa pine forests 
comes from prescribed burning studies. This body of research suggests a correlation 
between burning intensity and the magnitude of the inorganic N pulse (Kovacic et al. 
1986). Here we might predict that a high-intensity, stand-replacing wildfire in these 
forests would have a much more pronounced effect on N cycling than a lower-
intensity prescribed fire. Indeed, evidence from Grady and Hart (2006) supports 
such a relationship. Based on their findings, I hypothesized that inorganic N 
availability would remain high after a stand-replacing wildfire, but would gradually 
decline over time as regeneration proceeds, eventually resembling that of unburned 
forests. 
The research described in Chapter Four centers on communities of wood-
decay fungi as a potential control on post-fire wood decomposition (Le., C release) in 
southwestern ponderosa pine forests. Stand-replacing wildfires in these forests 
leave large amounts of C in the form of dead wood on the landscape. As this wood is 
decomposed by heterotrophic microbes, C is released to the atmosphere as C02. 
Research by Dore et al. (2008) demonstrates that burned forests in northern 
Arizona are net sources of atmospheric C for at least 10 years because rates of 
4

decomposition exceed C fixation by plants; thus, the fate of wood on these 
landscapes may be an important component to C cycles (Hurteau and Brooks 2011). 
In general, wood decomposition is controlled by abiotic factors (temperature 
and moisture), substrate (quality and quantity), and colonization by saprotrophic 
organisms (Harmon et al. 1986). We know comparatively little about the organisms, 
primarily basdiomycete and ascomycete fungi, that are responsible for much of 
wood decay. The literature review in Chapter Two summarizes our current 
knowledge about wood-decay fungi community patterns and emphasizes how little 
is known about these patterns. The research in Chapter Four explores the effect of 
stand-replacing wildfire disturbance on communities of wood-decay fungi in 
southwestern ponderosa pine forests, and examines the decomposition capabilities 
of a subset of the fungal species found in the observational portion of the research. 
This work differs from previous research in that it is the first instance where a 
combination of mycelial isolation and molecular techniques has been used for 
wood-decay fungi identification in these forests. This research is one of the few 
works to examine the effects of a high-severity wildfire, as opposed to a prescribed 
burn, on wood-decay fungal communities. 
The research in Chapter Five explores both management and wildfire effects 
on the decomposition of fine roots in southwestern ponderosa pine forests. The 
decomposition of fine roots is an important source of nutrients and organic matter 
for soils of many undisturbed ecosystems (McClaugherty et al. 1984, Silver and Vogt 
1993, Berg et al. 1998, Chen et al. 2002), but it may be especially important 
following a disturbance, such as management activities or stand-replacing wildfire.

This type of disturbance may cause an abrupt cessation in aboveground litter inputs, 
but the subsequent decay of fine root organic material belowground may serve as a 
buffer against these sudden declines in aboveground litter inputs (Fahey et al. 
1988). There is a relative dearth of fine root decomposition studies compared to 
those ofleaf decomposition for any ecosystem, and fine root decomposition has 
rarely been measured in ponderosa pine forests. However, if fine root 
decomposition rates exceed those of their comparable leaf litter, they may 
constitute a dynamic belowground pool of nutrients and soil organic matter in these 
ecosystems. 
This suite of studies integrates knowledge of two key ecosystem cycles (C 
and N) with a novel disturbance regime in southwestern ponderosa pine forests. 
Nitrogen cycles are examined over time since fire, while both above- and below-
ground C cycles are studied within communities of wood-decay fungi and fine root 
decomposition, respectively. The results fill important gaps in our knowledge of 
how stand-replacing wildfires influence ecosystem functioning in southwestern 
ponderosa pine forests, and they are especially important given the increasing 
frequency of this disturbance type in forests of the western u.s.

CHAPTER 2 
LITERATURE REVIEW: CURRENT RESEARCH IN WOOD-DECAY FUNGI 
COMMUNITY STRUCTURES 
Introduction 
Until recently, testing the hypothesis that microbial diversity was linked to 
ecosystem processes was alluring, but nearly impossible to rigorously examine 
because of the lack of appropriate tools. However, the recent introduction of DNA-
based molecular techniques has made tests of this hypothesis within reach of our 
scientific capabilities (Zak et al. 2006). For example, we now know that microbes 
exhibit biogeographical patterns (Fierer et al. 2007), and we know that differences 
in microbial communities can equate to functional differences (Strickland et al. 
2009). Transitioning from microbial community structure to ecosystem processes is 
a unique challenge, primarily because of difficulties in manipulating microbial 
communities (Mcguire and Treseder 2009). Despite this challenge, there is an 
increasing amount of attention drawn to this area of ecology. As such, it is important 
to reflect on the status of our current knowledge and synthesize what we have 
learned because this process may influence future research directions. 
I use wood-decaying fungi as a model for our understanding of microbial 
community patterns in this review for several reasons. First, relative to other 
microorganisms (e.g., bacteria and archaea), there is substantial information about 
fungal taxonomy, making it simpler to identify their community structure. Also, 
wood-decay fungi exhibit a vast diversity in their abilities to process wood (Boddy 
and Watkinson 1995, Worrall et al. 1997), implying that species compositional 
12

patterns influence associated rates of decomposition. Furthermore, assembly 
history patterns have already been shown to influence anteceding community 
structure, as well as affect decomposition rates of the wood substrate (Fukami et al. 
2010). Finally, a fundamental understanding of the decomposer community and 
how it influences rates of decay may be a critical, but currently lacking, component 
of global carbon (C) models (Cornwell et al. 2009, Mcguire and Treseder 2009). In 
this review, I begin by discussing some of the major factors that control fungal 
communities in wood. Then, I describe how molecular techniques can offer 
alternative information about these communities and suggest future directions for 
research. 
Controls on fungal diversity patterns 
The factors controlling wood-decay fungi community patterns are thought to 
be numerous. Specific information about a given species, such as its colonization 
strategy, substrate utilization, and both inter- and intra-species interactions are 
important considerations for community structure. Also, information about the 
wood environment, chemistry, state of decay, and landscape arrangement can all 
influence the abundance of a particular species and the community in which it is 
found (Rayner and Boddy 1988, Jonsson et al. 2008). Because of the plethora of 
potential factors and interactions, I have limited the scope of this review to a specific 
set of factors that have been demonstrated to affect fungal community structure 
patterns (RenvaIl1995). I have purposely not included extensive details about such 
factors as climate (temperature and moisture) and substrate (quality and quantity) 
because there are comparatively large amounts of information on their role in wood 
13

decomposition (Harmon et al. 1986). Instead, I focused on factors that appear to be 
important in the literature, but have not been included in a previous literature 
review. These factors include tree species, wood size, state of decay, and 
disturbance. 
Tree species vary widely in their wood chemistry and physical properties 
(Rayner and Boddy 1988, Cornwell et al. 2009), so it is not surprising that tree 
species exert strong influence on their fungal communities. For example, Lumley et 
al. (2001) incorporated an array of factors potentially driving fungal communities in 
aspen and white spruce forest, including climate and log variables (size, moisture 
content, species) into a multivariate analysis. Using mycelial isolation techniques, 
the authors found that tree species was the most important factor controlling fungal 
species composition. Kulhankova et al. (2006) reached similar conclusions using a 
molecular technique (temperature gradient gel electrophoresis; TGGE) in a 
hardwood forest. Also, Lindner et al. (2006), using sporocarp surveys in mixed 
hardwood stands, found that tree species was a strong predictor for the five most 
abundance fungal species encountered. Altogether, this research suggests that fungi 
exhibit a large degree of tree species preference. 
The size of decomposing wood is also a key factor in fungal community 
structure. In general, fungal species richness tends to increase with log diameter or 
volume, but smaller woody debris can support more species per unit volume 
because of its higher surface area to volume ratio (Kruys and Jonsson 1999, Allen et 
al. 2000, Heilmann-Clausen and Christensen 2004). Therefore, retaining a range of 
log diameters is usually recommended when managing for fungal species 
14

conservation purposes. Indeed, this was shown in a sporocarp survey in Norway 
spruce forest where Kruys et al. (1999) observed that uncommon species of fungi 
showed a preference for larger coarse woody debris (CWO). A related study also 
observed that certain species were confined to large diameter wood (Jonsson et al. 
2008). Lindner et al. (2006) found log diameter to be an important predictor ofthe 
five most abundant fungal species in a mixed hardwood forest. Other research 
suggests that fungal community composition on fine and coarse woody debris (FWD 
and CWO, respectively) is driven by different factors. Results from Bassler et al. 
(2010), using sporocarp surveys in a mixed hardwood forest revealed that, although 
species abundance was best predicted by surface area in both wood size classes, 
species composition was predominantly controlled by surface area in CWO but by 
microclimate in FWD. Collectively, these results demonstrate that wood size clearly 
influences the fungal community structure, but the interactions between size and 
other environmental variables may be difficult to tease apart. 
The state of wood decay is a consistent predictor of fungal community 
structure, but there is a lot of complexity in these patterns. Several studies have 
observed that the state of wood decay is the strongest predictor of fungal species 
composition using both mycelial isolation (Lumley et al. 2001) and sporocarp 
surveys (Fukasawa et al. 2009a, Pouska et al. 2011). However, other work suggests 
that state of decay may be less important to some fungal species. For example, 
Jonsson et al. (2008), using sporocarp surveys in Norway spruce (Pice a abies), 
revealed that early fungal colonizers were more affected by the state of decay while 
secondary colonizers were more likely to be influenced by log characteristics and 
15

arrangement. This suggests that predicting community composition in the later 
stages of decay may be constrained by environmental factors. 
An important consideration for the aforementioned research is the method 
used for species identification. For example, Rajala et al. (2010) observed that 
species richness peaked at intermediate stages of decay using sporocarps surveys, 
but at later stages of decay using denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE). 
Indeed, it is unclear how much general conclusions in the literature would change 
because of methodological differences (see discussion below). However, research 
using mycelial isolation and microscopic identification found that fungal species 
richness increased with the state of decay (Fukasawa et al. 2009b), suggesting that 
mycecial isolation and molecular techniques may yield comparable results. 
Intermediate stages of wood decay may facilitate the most distinct species 
composition, as well as the most species coexistence because of fungal succession 
patterns over time. Species with good dispersal capabilities that are able to quickly 
use the simpler forms of C in the wood would be expected to dominate initially, but 
as the simpler forms of C are used up, species composition would reflect substrate 
limitation in that those fungi capable of breaking down complex C (e.g., lignin) 
would dominate. Hence, species richness might be highest at intermediate stages of 
decay because the diversity of C substrates would be maximized and thus, open up 
more niche opportunities. Support for this pattern was revealed by Jonsson et al. 
(2008); using sporocap surveys, they observed the highest species coexistence at 
intermediate stages of wood decay. Also, Fukasawa et al. (2009b) observed that 
16

species composition was the most distinct at intermediate stages of decay using 
mycelial isolation in a beech forest. 
McGuire and Treseder (2009) suggest that species identity within microbial 
communities is most important in the later stages of decomposition when only the 
very recalcitrant forms of C remain. They point out that only certain fungal species 
with specific enzymatic capacities can process complex C structures, and, therefore, 
the species present on a given substrate is rate limiting to decomposition. It is also 
likely that, given the narrow range of these fungi, that wood in the late stages of 
decay may harbor more similar communities. Indeed, Rajala et al. (2010) observed 
this pattern and suggested it was a result of the community becoming more stable 
after airborne and other forms of colonization by spores was maximized. 
Forest disturbance, such as timber harvest, prescribed burning or wildfire, 
may have a range of consequences for fungal community structure, but few studies 
have addressed their impacts. Clear-cut logging in Fennoscandinavia had strong 
effects on fungal species composition, as determined by sporocarp surveys 1 to 4 
years following treatment (Junninen et al. 2008). However, the long-term (25 years) 
effects of slash removal following clear-cut in northern Sweden are presumed to be 
almost non-existent, since no differences in species richness or abundance were 
observed (Allmer et al. 2009). Controlled burning in northern coniferous forests 
favored certain species of fungi, causing short-term (::; 5 years) alterations in 
community composition (Olsson and Jonsson 2010, Berglund et al. 2011). A decline 
in species richness was observed in the first year following burning (Olsson and 
Jonsson 2010) in one study, but other studies showed that the number of species

recovered within 1 to 5 years following a burn (Berglund et al. 2011). Fungal species 
richness was also affected by wildfire and timber harvest in aspen and white spruce 
forest of northern Alberta, Canada, as measured by mycelial isolation. Both types of 
disturbance led to lower species richness in the recently disturbed forests (one 
year), while the highest species richness was observed in undisturbed forest 
(Lumley et al. 2001). 
Methodological approaches andfuture directions 
To date, methodologies for assessing communities of wood-decay fungi vary 
considerably. In climates where moisture is not limiting to sporocarp production, 
such as northern Europe, sporocarp surveys are predominantly performed as a 
rapid means of assessment (e.g., Bassler et al. 2010, Ovaskainen et al. 2010a, 
Berglund et al. 2011). However, sporocarp surveys only identify those fungi that are 
sporulating at the time of the survey, and, therefore, they do not necessarily 
represent the entire species richness. Also, in ecosystems that are moisture limited, 
sporocarp production is confined to wetter periods of the year, such as spring 
snowmelt or summer monsoon in the southwestern U.S. Because of these 
limitations, researchers may employ both mycelial isolation and molecular 
techniques. A relatively large number of wood-decay fungi can be cultured on media 
using mycelial isolation, wherein emerging fungi are placed in pure culture. 
Subsequent species identification depends on fungal morphology, which can be 
difficult because cultures typically only produce vegetative reproductive structures 
(conidia). An alternative is to use molecular techniques to identify the species in 
culture (Allmer et al. 2006).

Much of research on the molecular identification of fungi began with work on 
ectomycorrhizal fungi (Gardes et al. 1991), but is now applied to broader groups of 
fungi. Ectomycorrhizal DNA can be extracted from root tips, which avoids many of 
the complications that accompany extracts from soil and wood (e.g., inhibition by 
polyphenolic compounds); however, methods for extracting fungal DNA from soil 
and wood continue to improve. For fungi in general, the internal transcribed spacer 
region (ITS) of the ribosomal DNA is targeted for amplification by polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR). The ITS region is relatively small in size (600 - SOO base pairs), but 
high degree of variability, which enables one to distinguish fungal species by the 
nucleotide sequence (Gardes and Bruns 1993). Its location, between two highly 
conserved gene regions (S.SS and 2SS), facilitated the development of suitable 
primers for DNA amplification using PCR (Gardes and Bruns 1993). The primer 
pairs ITS1-F (specific for higher fungi), and ITS4-B (specific for basidiomycetes) or 
ITS4 (universal primer; Gardes and Bruns 1993, Jasalavich et al. 2000) are 
commonly used to amplify fungal DNA. 
Several DNA fingerprinting techniques, such as restriction fragment length 
polymorphism (RFLP), terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-
RFLP), denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE), and temperature gradient 
gel electrophoresis (TGGE), have been used as a culture-free method of assessing 
fungal communities in wood (see Zak et al. 2006 for further description). These 
techniques provide a profile of the community composition without the added effort 
of cloning (for DNA extracts that contain multiple species). However, DNA 
fingerprinting techniques tend to detect only the dominant taxa in a given 
19

community, and they do not permit the identification of unique fungal species (Zak 
et al. 2006). Furthermore, there is no national database of community profiles, 
which makes it difficult to draw comparisons across studies (Fierer et al. 2009). 
Recent work has sequenced the DNA bands from TGGE and DGGE analyses, which 
enhances the community information by identifying the fungal species, but these 
methods still only detect the dominant species (Kulhankova et al. 2006, Rajala et al. 
2010). T-RFLP techniques have made similar advances, and have the same 
disadvantage CAllmer et al. 2006, Allmer et al. 2009). Allmer et al. (2006) conducted 
a comparision ofT-RFLP, mycelial isolation followed by DNA sequencing, and 
sporocarp surveys, and assessed the limitations of each technique. Mycelial isolation 
detected the most species of the three methods, but it is impossible to know if other 
species were present but not culturable. T -RFLP detected only five species in total, 
and only one of these was unique for that method. 
The use of high-throughput sequencing (also known as pyrosequencing or 
454 sequencing) to identify microbial community structure from environmental 
samples is increasing in popularity because the cost is no longer prohibitive. The 
advantage of this type of sequencing is that one can submit a DNA extract containing 
mUltiple microbial taxa (e.g., from soil) and obtain thousands of sequences at a time. 
Therefore, one can be relatively certain of identifying all the species in the 
community while also obtaining a measurement of the relative abundance for each. 
The disadvantages of high-throughput sequencing are the possibility of sequencing 
errors and subsequent overestimations of diversity. 
20

Ovaskainen et al. (2010b) recently used 454 sequencing for the identification 
of wood decay fungal communities in Finnish spruce forests, and compared the 
results with two other methods (sporocarp surveys and DGGE). The 454 sequencing 
detected the greatest number of species (30), and 19 of these were not detected by 
either of the other methods. DGGE profiling detected the lowest number of species 
(9), and only one of these was unique to that method. Sporocarp surveys detected 
10 unique species not found using the other methods. The results show that high-
throughput sequencing is a promising technique and would be especially useful in 
arid climates, where sporocarp production is often moisture limited. 
In general, all the molecular techniques are limited by the strength of the 
database used to match the sequences observed. Zak et al. (2006) reviewed some of 
the databases used in microbial ecology; of these, the largest is GenBank, hosted by 
the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCB I; 
http://www.ncbLnih.gov/).This annotated database is comprehensive, but not 
curated, and, therefore, it has the potential to contain a high amount of errors. Also, 
despite containing over one hundred million sequences, researchers using the Basic 
Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) to match their sequences often encounter 
instances where a sequence does not align to any of the sequences in the database 
(Ovaskainen et al. 2010b, Rajala et al. 2010). Despite these issues, GenBank is 
extremely advantageous, both for its convenience and wide accessibility, and it 
provides some of the most up-to-date sequence information available for microbial 
ecologists. The continued submission of quality, annotated sequences by 
researchers will undoubtedly improve the resolution of the database in the future.

Clearly, there is no single best way to identify wood-decay fungal community 
structure. However, the combination of traditional (sporocarp surveys and mycelial 
isolation) and molecular techniques appears to yield the most comprehensive 
assessments. High-throughput sequencing can provide the most information with 
the least amount of effort, but in situations where the cost is prohibitive, cloning and 
direct sequencing may provide a comparative level of resolution with a considerable 
amount of effort. Community profiling techniques are advantageous when coarse 
measurements of community composition are required, but do little to advance our 
understanding of fungal diversity unless combined with another method, such as 
sporocarop surveys. 
Future work on wood-decay fungal community structure is promising 
because these communities are conveniently used as model communities to test 
ecological theory (e.g., Fukami et al. 2010, Ovaskainen et al. 2010a). Also, because 
not all communities are equal in their ability to process C (Fukami et al. 2010), a 
comprehensive understanding of wood-decay fungal communities could better 
inform global C models (Mcguire and Treseder 2009). In turn, this could lead to 
more realistic and potentially mechanistic global C models. Therefore, we can expect 
this field to evolve rapidly in the coming years because of the advantages in using 
wood-decay fungi as a model community, the importance for biodiversity 
assessments, and the relevance to global C cycles.

CHAPTER 3 
LONG-TERM ALTERATIONS OF NITROGEN CYCLING FOLLOWING SEVERE 
WILDFIRE IN SOUTHWESTERN PONDEROSA PINE FORESTS 
ABSTRACT 
Stand-replacing wildfires are a novel disturbance within southwestern 
ponderosa pine forests and, as a result, there are many uncertainties regarding their 
influence on post-fire ecosystem functioning. In particular, N cycling patterns may 
be altered to a greater extent under this fire regime relative to the historic, low-
intensity fire regime. However, few studies have examined the direct effects of this 
type of fire on N cycling, nor the long-term consequences. We used a stand-replacing 
wildfire chronosequence to examine the long-term dynamics of net and gross 
nitrogen (N) transformations following severe burning. To control for 
environmental variation among the burned sites, we established paired, adjacent 
unburned sites for each burn year. We tested direct effects of fire by comparing 
burned and unburned sites for each year, and we assessed long-term changes over 
time using the differences between each burned and unburned pair. We expected N 
transformations and pool sizes in burned areas to become more similar to 
comparable unburned forest as these areas become re-vegetated. Net N 
transformations continued to be affected by fire after 30+ years. Burned sites had 
consistently higher rates of net nitrification than unburned sites. Overall rates of net 
N mineralization were lower in burned than unburned sites, but net nitrification 
was a greater proportion of net mineralization in the burned sites. Burned sites had

higher N03- pools than unburned sites, but NH4+ pools were similar between burned 
and unburned sites. Gross rates of N mineralization were not different between 
burned and unburned paired sites, but burned sites had generally higher rates of 
gross nitrification than unburned sites. Overall, our findings indicate that the effects 
of high-severity wildfires on N cycling in these ecosystems persist for several 
decades, and we hypothesize that this is the result of altered vegetation dynamics in 
burned sites. These results may have long-term implications for the recovery of 
ecosystem N and associated rates of net primary productivity in these ecosystems.

INTRODUCTION 
The complex interactions between land management and climate change 
have led to pronounced changes in the wildfire disturbance regimes of coniferous 
forests in the western u.s. (McKenzie et al. 2004, Westerling et al. 2006, Williams et 
al. 2010). Wildfire is the most pervasive natural disturbance in these ecosystems 
(Agee 1998), and a century of fire exclusion, coupled with a warmer and drier 
climate, have culminated in widespread increases in the frequency and size of stand-
replacing wildfires throughout this region (Covington and Moore 1994a, Westerling 
et al. 2003, Westerling et al. 2006). Severe fires can alter a suite of community and 
ecosystem properties, including plant community structure (Hebel et al. 2009, Ojeda 
et al. 2010), primary productivity (Sabo et al. 2008), microbial communities 
(Smithwick et al. 2005), and the biogeochemical cycling of carbon (Wardle et al. 
2003, Rothstein et al. 2004, Kashian et al. 2006) and nitrogen (DeLuca et al. 2002, 
Grady and Hart 2006, Turner et al. 2007). Some coniferous forests are adapted to 
high-severity wildfires (e.g., jack pine, Pinus banksiana Lamb.; lodgepole pine, Pinus 
contorta Douglas ex Louden var. lati/olia Engelm. ex S. Watson), but others, such as 
southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum Engelm), are 
adapted to low-intensity surface fire regimes (Cooper 1960). For these forests, the 
relatively common occurrence of high-severity fires over the last -40 years 
(Covington et al. 1997) constitutes a major shift in their natural disturbance regime. 
Climate predictions suggest that stand-replacing wildfires will occur with increased 
in frequency in the future (Westerling et al. 2006, Marshall et al. 2008, Williams et

al. 2010); however, the long-term implications of this disturbance type on 
ecosystem functioning are uncertain. 
The effects of stand-replacing wildfires on nitrogen (N) dynamics are of 
particular interest because N, along with water, is limiting to cone production and 
diameter growth in southwestern ponderosa pine forests (Heidmann et al. 1979). As 
a result, the post-fire N availability may be critical to pine regeneration and net 
primary productivity (NPP). Historically, the relatively rapid turnover of N was the 
result of a frequent, low-intensity surface fire regime, which maintained forests in 
open stands with abundant herbaceous openings (Cooper 1960, Covington and 
Moore 1994a). Hart et al. (2005) hypothesized that this vegetation structure 
influenced the belowground microbial community, leading to the regulation of rapid 
N cycling. However, historic fire regimes in this region were virtually eliminated by 
practices introduced by Euro-American settlers: livestock grazing reduced 
herbaceous fuels that would carry a surface fire, and active fire suppression led to 
extended periods of fire exclusion (Covington et al. 1997). Current forests are 
characterized by high densities of small diameter trees (White 1985, Covington and 
Moore 1994b), and associated rates of net N transformations are less than half that 
of the historic regime, as suggested by forest restoration treatments (Kaye and Hart 
1998a). 
Although N transformations in southwestern ponderosa pine forests have 
been substantially altered due to a century of fire exclusion, the current regime of 
infrequent, stand-replacing wildfires has the potential to induce alternative 
trajectories in N cycling. Fires oxidize much of the N stored organically in biomass

(Johnson et al. 2005), but they also cause a temporary pulse in available N in the 
soil, which may facilitate post-fire regeneration (White 1986, Covington and Sackett 
1992, Wan et al. 2001). This pulse is initially comprised of pyrogenically produced 
ammonium (NH4+), which remains elevated for approximately 1 to 2 years following 
fire (Raison 1979, Covington and Sackett 1992, Prieto-Fernandez et al. 2004, Turner 
et al. 2007, Boerner et al. 2009). Associated with this is the enhancement of 
nitrification arising from the increased substrate availability (NH4+) and higher soil 
pH (Christensen 1973, Bauhus et al. 1993). Elevated levels of nitrate (N03-) are 
typically found within a few days of the fire and reach their maximum 
approximately 1 year after prescribed burning (Covington and Sackett 1992, Wan et 
al. 2001). Importantly, stand-replacing wildfires may have greater effects on N 
mineralization patterns than prescribed burning because they tend to burn more 
intensely (Kovacic et al. 1986, Covington and Sackett 1992). Indeed, Grady and Hart 
(2006) observed longer-term pulses in net N mineralization, seven years after a 
stand-replacing wildfire in a southwestern ponderosa pine forest. 
Given the multitude of studies that have been conducted on the short-term 
responses of wildfire, there is comparatively little known about the long-term 
effects on N cycling. Long-term studies employing a chronosequence approach 
showed declines in inorganic N availability over time since stand-replacing wildfire 
in northern boreal forests (DeLuca et al. 2002) and lodgepole pine forests (Turner et 
al. 2007). In contrast, patterns of initial decline and subsequent increase over time 
in net N mineralization and NH4+ concentrations following stand-replacing wildfire 
have been observed in jack pine forests (Yermakov and Rothstein 2006), and 
32

southern boreal forests (Brais et al. 1995). Regardless ofthe inconsistent patterns 
observed, these long-term studies all occur in forests that are adapted to stand-
replacing fire regimes. It is difficult to draw comparisons to southwestern 
ponderosa pine forest because stand-replacing wildfires are a novel disturbance to 
these ecosystems, and, therefore, N cycling response patterns may be altogether 
different. 
To assess long-term N cycling dynamics following stand-replacing wildfires 
in southwestern ponderosa pine forests, we measured net and gross N 
transformation rates along a wildfire chronosequence. Each burned site was paired 
with an adjacent site in unburned forest to better isolate the effect of time since fire. 
We hypothesized (1) that burned and unburned sites would have different rates of 
net N transformations because of inherent microclimate differences caused by the 
fire, and that these differences would be more pronounced during the summer 
monsoon season (mid-July to mid-September) when plant growth rates are 
maximized. Next, we hypothesized (2) that rates of net N mineralization and 
associated (NH4+) pool sizes would decline with time since fire as vegetation 
demand for N increases. To test this, we assessed the size of the differences between 
burned and paired unburned sites over time since fire. We expected the differences 
to become smaller over time as the burned sites began to resemble unburned 
forests. We also hypothesized (3) that rates of net nitrification and associated (N03-) 
pool sizes would decline with time since fire as a result of increase plant-microbe 
competition for NH4+ (Kaye and Hart 1997). Similar to hypothesis (2), we examined 
the differences over time since fire between burned and unburned paired sites. In 
33

addition, we calculated the relative proportion of net nitrification to N 
mineralization at each site and examined how the difference in the ratio at burned 
and unburned paired sites changed over time. We expected the differences in this 
ratio to decline over time and eventually resemble that of the paired unburned sites. 
Finally, we hypothesized (4) that rates of gross N mineralization would be low 
initially following fire because of C limitations resulting from combustion (Koyama 
et al. 2010), but these rates would increase over time since fire as C inputs from 
plant litter increase (Turner et al. 2007). Concurrently, we expected that post-fire 
rates of gross nitrification would be high initially following fire because of warmer 
soil temperatures and higher pH (Raison 1979, Hobbs and Schimel 1984), but would 
similarly decline with time since fire, eventually resembling rates in comparable 
undisturbed forest (Davidson et al. 1992). For both gross N transformations we 
expected these temporal trends to be reflected as a decline over time since fire, in 
the difference between burned and unburned forests. 
METHODS 
Study sites and experimental design 
We conducted this study across seven post-wildfire sites in ponderosa pine 
forests of northern Arizona, U.S. According to the Western Regional Climate Center 
(www.wrcc.drLedu), the Fort Valley weather station (within 23 km and at a similar 
elevation to all sites) received 65.4 cm of precipitation during the 12-month study 
period (01-July-2007 to 01-July-2008). The mean daily maximum air temperature 
for the same period was 17.2Â°C, and the mean daily minimum air temperature was -
3.7Â°C. The 30-year averages (1971-2000) for the station were 56.3 cmly of

precipitation, with mean daily maximum and minimum air temperatures of 16.3 Â°C 
and -3.6Â°C, respectively. Study sites were located on basaltic parent material and 
had each experienced one stand-replacing crown fire (> 95% tree mortality) within 
the last 60 years according to records at Coconino and Kaibab National Forests. 
We employed a chronosequence (space-for-time substitution) approach to 
examine the long-term effects of stand-replacing wildfires on these ecosystems. We 
chose to sample a broad temporal extent (seven sites over a 32-year period) rather 
than having replicated sites over a smaller number of years because this design was 
better suited to illustrating changes in N cycling dynamics over time. Two of the 
older wildfire sites (23 and 34 years) were salvage logged and replanted after the 
fire, which was the typical management practice at the time. The other sites did not 
receive active management after the fire. We acknowledge that the management 
difference compromises our study design to some extent. However, we considered 
the need for a clearer understanding of long-term post-wildfire ecosystem 
functioning, coupled with the limited number of suitable wildfire sites in this region 
to be the most important factors for conducting this research. Furthermore, a 
companion study performed at this chronosequence indicates that both live plant 
biomass C and woody debris C remained relatively consistent with time since fire 
(Ross et al., In review), suggesting that these management activities did not 
substantially compromise the chronosequence. 
Seven wildfire sites were selected encompassing a 32-year period between 
1973 and 2005 (Table 1). Each site was paired with an adjacent unburned patch of 
forest to better isolate the effects offire and reduce other sources of variation

(Johnson and Miyanishi 2008). Unburned sites were located in the nearest 
accessible unburned forest. Vegetation in the unburned sites consisted of ponderosa 
pine with some Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.) at lower elevations or mixed 
conifers (Pseudotsuga menzies;; (Mirb.) Franco and Pinus strobi/ormis Engelm.) at 
higher elevations. 
At each wildfire site, we established three, 200-m transects within the 
perimeter of the burn. Burn area heterogeneity prevented identical transect 
orientation and layout across all the sites, but we attempted to sample in a similar 
manner across all sites as much as possible; this included covering a similar areal 
extent at all the burned and unburned sites. Three, 10-m radius plots were located 
100 m apart along each ofthe three transects for a total of nine plots at each site (n 
= 9). Plots were at least 100 m from roads and 20 m from trails or old logging roads. 
At most ofthe sites, transects were at least 100 m from unburned forest; however, 
at the two most recent burns (time since fire: two and six years), the size and 
perimeter of the burn meant that plots were approximately 25 m from unburned 
forest. We collected above- and below-ground C data at each plot, including tree 
biomass C, herbaceous C, organic horizon C, woody debris C, and mineral soil total C, 
total N, pH, gravimetric water content (GWC), and bulk density, as described by Ross 
et al. (In review). 
Quantification of net N mineralization rates 
We measured in situ net N transformations (Le., net N mineralization and net 
nitrification) rates over two incubation periods spanning 12-months. The first 
incubation went from early July through October, 2007 (monsoonal period; growing 
36

season), and the second incubation went from November to early July, 2008 
(dormant season). We used the resin core method (DiStefano and Gholz 1986), as 
modified by Kaye and Hart (1998). This modification allows for the concurrent 
measurement of net N transformations in the forest floor (0 horizon) and mineral 
soil (0-15 cm) using the same resin core. The cores were incubated at a fixed 
distance (7.5 m) and angle from the plot center. We estimated net N mineralization 
by calculating the difference between the initial and final soil (NH4+ + N03-)-N pools 
plus the (NH4+ + N03-)-N adsorbed onto the mixed-bed, ion exchange resin (IER) bag 
fixed beneath the mineral soil core. We estimated net nitrification in a similar 
manner using the initial and final soil N03--N pools and the IER adsorbed N03--N. 
Forest floor net N mineralization and nitrification were estimated by placing a 
second IER bag on top of the mineral soil core and putting forest floor material on 
top of this bag. Rates were calculated using the difference between the initial and 
final forest floor N (NH4+ + N03- for mineralization; N03- for nitrification) pools, plus 
that component adsorbed onto the IER bag beneath the forest floor. There was not 
sufficient forest floor material at the wildfire sites to estimate N transformations, 
but we placed an IER bag on top of the mineral soil to ensure that inputs from 
throughfall were not included in the measurements. 
The soils were stored at 4Â°C (:5 5 days) until sieved field-moist Â«4 mm) and 
extracted. Thirty grams of mineral soil were extracted in 100 ml of 2 M KCI and the 
IER was extracted in 100 ml of 2 M KCI. The forest floor material was processed by 
removing items> 1cm in diameter, cutting up the remainder with scissors and 
homogenizing before extracting 5 g in 25 ml of 2 M KCI. Extracts were mechanically

shaken for one hour, filtered through preleached (with deionized water) Whatman 
#1 filters, and frozen until inorganic N concentrations could be analyzed. Extracts 
were analyzed for NH4+, and N03Â· on a Lachat AE Flow-Injection Analyzer (Lachat 
Instruments Inc., Loveland, CO, USA), using indophenol blue (Lachat Instruments 
Inc., 1990) and cadmium reduction-diazotization (Lachat Instruments Inc., 1992) 
methods, respectively. The mean bulk density for all four mineral soil cores taken 
during the study period (2 incubation periods, 1 initial and 1 final for each) was 
used to convert the mineral soil mass-based transformation rates to an areal basis. 
For the forest floor transformations, the mean bulk density computed from two 30 x 
30 em quadrats taken at each plot was used to convert mass-based forest floor rates 
to an areal basis. 
Quantification of gross N transformation rates 
We used the lSN isotope dilution method (Hart et al. 1994) to measure gross 
N transformation rates in a 24-hour laboratory incubation. For logistical reasons, we 
selected a subset of the burned and unburned chronosequence sites (5 of the 7 
original: 2,7,11,30, and 34 years since fire) and plots (6 plots ofthe original 9 at 
each site) for these measurements. In doing so, we reduced the number of analyses, 
which are both time consuming and expensive, while retaining enough sites to 
compare older to more recent fires. We conducted this measurement in mid-August 
because the soil was moist and warm from the summer monsoons, and we expected 
N transformations to be maximized during this period (Kaye and Hart 1998a). We 
also measured soil temperatures at these sites using data logger per site (Hobo 
Pendant Data Loggers; Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA, USA) at a depth of

5 cm in the mineral soil; values were recorded every 10 seconds for 3.5 weeks. All 
values were stored and mean soil temperatures were calculated for each site. 
We collected mineral soil (0-10 cm) for the gross N transformation 
incubation on 11-13 August 2008 by taking cores with an Oakfield sampler 
(Oakfield Apparatus, Inc.; Oakfield, WI, USA). The cores were 1.9-cm diameter and 
were taken from a 0.5 m2 area at a fixed (7.5 m) distance from the plot center and in 
the opposite direction from where the net transformation cores were incubated. We 
chose this location because we wanted to avoid soil disturbance created by 
companion research at the plots. Soils were kept on ice while in transport and 
refrigerated in the laboratory for 24-48 hours. All soils were sieved at field-moisture 
content Â«4 mm) on 13 August. On 14-August-2008, we weighed approximately 25 g 
of sieved soil into each of five specimen containers. The first sample was 
immediately extracted in 100 ml 2 M KCI, and the concentrations of NH4+ and N03-
were used to estimate initial pool sizes. The other four samples were divided into 
nitrification or mineralization groups at time 0 hours (to) or time 24 hours (t24). 
We injected 0.35 ml of a labeled solution, 15N03- as K15N03- or 15NH4+ as 
(15NH4+)zS04 (200 mg NIL; 99 atom % 15N enrichment) into the appropriate soil 
using a syringe and needle. Each 0.35 ml aliquot was divided into four equal 
proportions and injected into the soil at four evenly spaced locations. Each injection 
was made approximately halfway in between the soil surface and the bottom of the 
specimen container to ensure even distribution of the label. The solution injections 
added approximately 3.5 Ilg N/kg dry soil for both of the N species and increased 
the GWC by approximately 14%. The to soils were immediately extracted in 100 ml

of 2 M KCI. The t24 soils were incubated inside sealed glass Mason jars (-1 L) with 
distilled water at the bottom to maintain the moisture content. The jars were 
incubated for 24 h in the dark at 20Â°C before the soils were extracted in 100 ml2M 
KCI. All extractions were performed as described above for net N transformations 
and frozen until subsequent analysis on the Lachat (initial pool sizes) or preparation 
for 15N analysis. 
We performed the 15N analyses using the diffusion procedure described by 
Stark and Hart (1996). The 15N contents were determined on the diffusion extracts 
using an elemental analyzer interfaced to a continuous flow isotope ratio mass 
spectrometer (University of California, Davis, Stable Isotope Facility; PDZ Europa 
ANCA-GSL elemental analyzer interfaced to a PDZ Europa 20-20 isotope ratio mass 
spectrometer; Sercon Ltd., Cheshire, UK). We used the NH4+ and N03- pool sizes at to 
and t24, the atom % 15N excess at to and t24, and the equations of Kirkham and 
Bartholomew (1954) to calculate rates of gross mineralization and nitrification. 
Statistical Analyses 
All data were checked for adherence of the assumptions of regression and 
ANOVA using the Shapiro-Wilk's test for normality and the O'Brien test of equality 
of variance. Outliers in the net N transformation data were identified as points with 
studentized residuals outside the 99% confidence interval of the standard normal 
distribution, and were excluded from the analyses. This resulted in the removal of 
one or two outlying data points for each site and process. An a priori alpha level was 
set at 0.05. All statistical analyses were conducted using IMP statistical software 
(SAS Institute; version 5.0.1.2).

We examined the mineral soil characteristics (total C, total N, C:N, pH, and 
GWC) using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with time since fire (years) 
and treatment (burned or unburned) as the main effects. All of these analyses 
contained significant year X treatment interactions; thus, treatment differences 
were assessed for each year separately. 
We assessed the effect of fire on net N transformations in the mineral soil 
using a two-way ANOVA with time since fire (years), treatment (burned or 
unburned) as the main effects, and means were separated using Tukey's HSD. When 
a significant year X treatment interaction was encountered (net nitrification), we 
assessed treatment differences for each year separately using a one-way ANOV A. 
We examined the effect of season (growing or dormant) on net N transformations 
using a three-way ANOVA with time since fire, treatment, and season as the main 
effects; however, there were significant interactions between season and time since 
fire (P = 0.02), and between season and treatment (P < 0.0001). Thus, we proceeded 
by analyzing season and treatment for each burn year separately using a two-way 
ANOVA. We used Tukey's HSD to separate means for season and treatment; 
however, when significant season X treatment interactions occurred for a given time 
since fire year, we analyzed season and treatment separately for that year. 
We assessed changes in net N mineralization rates and NH4+ pools over time 
since fire by calculating the differences between the burned and unburned paired 
sites (burned - unburned). We then explored temporal patterns in the differences 
using linear regression. We examined patterns in net nitrification and N03- pool 
sizes in a similar manner. In addition, we calculated the ratio of net nitrification to

net N mineralization at each site; we then examined the differences in the ratios 
between burned and unburned paired sites over time using linear regression. 
Finally, we investigated the effect of fire on the NH4+ and N03- pool sizes using two-
way ANOV A, with time since fire and treatment as the main effects. 
We assessed the effect of fire on gross N transformations in the mineral soil 
using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with time since fire (years) and 
treatment (burned or unburned) as the main effects, and means were separated 
using Tukey's HSD. We analyzed changes in the gross N transformation rates over 
time by computing the difference between the burned and unburned paired sites 
(burn - unburned) and performing a linear regression with time since fire. In 
addition, we calculated the ratio of gross nitrification to gross N mineralization at 
each site; we then examined the differences in the ratios between burned and 
unburned paired sites over time using linear regression 
RESULTS 
The mineral soil characteristics varied between the burned and unburned 
treatments across the burn years (Table 3.1). The most consistent differences were 
observed for pH, wherein the burned soils had higher pH values than the unburned 
soils at all the sites except for year 23. Also, C:N ratios were lower in the burned 
soils than the unburned soils at years 6, 7, 11, and 30. 
Both time since fire and treatment (burned or unburned) had a significant 
effect on net N mineralization rates (P = 0.03 and P = 0.0002, respectively), and 
there was no significant interaction term (P = 0.44). Tukey's HSD did not reveal 
statistical differences between burned and unburned pairs for any of the burn years

(Figure 3.1A). Pools ofNH4+ were affected by treatment (P = 0.04), but not time 
since fire (P = 0.33; Figure 3.2A), nor was there a significant interaction (P = 0.14). A 
significant time since fire X treatment interaction was observed for net nitrification 
rates (P = 0.008); thus, we compared the treatments separately for each year. Net 
nitrification rates were significantly higher in the burned than the unburned sites 
for all years (P < 0.05; Figure 3.1B). Pools of N03- were affected by treatment (P < 
0.0001) but not time since fire (P = 0.11), nor was there a significant interaction (P = 
0.19). Nitrate pools were statistically higher in the burned sites than unburned at 
years 2, 23, and 30. We did not include the net N transformation rates in the organic 
horizon at the unburned sites in the net N transformation rate site estimate because 
adding them did not alter the overall patterns between treatments and time since 
fire; however, net N mineralization rates in the organic horizon ranged from 0.36 -
1.0 g N m-2 y-l, and net nitrification rates ranged from 0.09 - 0.27 g N m-2 y-l. 
Net N transformation rates were generally higher during the growing season 
(July - October) than the dormant season (November - June; Figures 3.3, 3.4). 
Differences between burned and unburned sites were evident for net nitrification 
during both growing and dormant season, except for year 23, when no seasonal 
differences were observed, and year 34, when there were no differences in the 
dormant season rates. Distinctions between burned and unburned sites were also 
more apparent during the growing season for net N mineralization (Figures 3.3A, 
3.4A). During the growing season, net N mineralization was higher at the unburned 
sites for all years except 6 and 30, while this pattern was only observed at year 7 
during the dormant season.

The differences in net N mineralization rates (burned - unburned) were not 
significantly correlated with time since fire (R2 = 0.29, P = 0.21; Figure 3.5A), and 
neither were the differences in NH4+ pool sizes (R2 = 0.05, P = 0.64; data not shown). 
Similarly, net nitrification rate differences and N03- pool size differences were not 
correlated with time since fire (R2 = 0.12, P = 0.45 and R2 = 0.26, P = 0.24, 
respectively; Figure 3.5B). The differences in the net nitrification: net N 
mineralization ratios were also not correlated with time since fire (R2 = 0.05, P = 
0.62; Figure 3.5). 
Rates of gross N mineralization varied with year (P = 0.01), but not with 
treatment (burned or unburned; P = 0.49; Figure 3.6A). In contrast, rates of gross 
nitrification varied by both year (P = 0.01) and treatment (P < 0.0001). Tukey's HSD 
revealed that burned and unburned pairs were significantly different from each 
other at years 7 and 30 (Figure 3.6B). The ratios of net nitrification to gross N 
mineralization were generally higher in the burned than the unburned soils (Figure 
3.6C) with the exception of year 34, when rates of gross N mineralization were very 
close to zero. The differences between burned and unburned rates of gross N 
mineralization and nitrification were not correlated with time since fire (HZ = 0.22; P 
= 0.43; R2 = 0.004; P = 0.92, respectively; data not shown), nor were the differences 
in the ratio of gross nitrification rates to gross N mineralization (R2 = 0.003; P = 
0.93; data not shown). The average daily temperatures were approximately 4Â°C 
warmer in burned than unburned soils (14.4 Â°C and 18.7 Â°C, respectively), though 
lack of replication prevented us from confirming this statistically. 
DISCUSSION 
44

This research provides new insights on the long-term N cycling patterns in 
southwestern ponderosa pine forests following a stand-replacing wildfire, which is 
a novel disturbance type in this ecosystem. Our results suggest that the effects of 
stand-replacing wildfire on both net and gross N transformation rates and inorganic 
N pool sizes persist for several decades in this ecosystem. Since soil N 
transformations closely parallel vegetation recovery following wildfire (Hobbs and 
Schimel1984, Hart et al. 2005, Koyama et al. 2010), the patterns we observed are 
potentially a reflection of an ecosystem state change driven by post-fire 
establishment. 
Our net N transformation results suggest that the effects of stand-replacing 
wildfires on N cycling dynamics in these ecosystems last longer than the length of 
our 34-year chronosequence. In support of our first hypothesis, annual rates of net 
nitrification were consistently higher in the burned sites than the paired unburned 
sites, and there was a strong burn effect on annual net N mineralization rates. This 
pattern was also observed for the NH4+ and N03Â· pool sizes, wherein levels of N03Â· 
were elevated at three of the burned sites, and NH4+ pools were generally affected 
by burning. The patterns we observed for net nitrification and N03Â· pool sizes may 
be explained by environmental conditions often observed in recently burned sites 
that facilitate nitrification, including higher pH and soil temperatures (Raison 1979, 
Hart et al. 2005). Our soil temperature data suggest that daily mineral soil 
temperatures in the burned sites are approximately 4Â° C higher than the unburned 
sites. Also, the mineral soils in the unburned sites were generally more acidic than 
the burned sites (Table 3.1), which may be inhibiting autotrophic nitrifiers (Johnson 
45

1992), and therefore, may also explain the patterns of elevated net nitrification 
rates. 
Net N transformation rates were two to three times as high during the 
growing season than the dormant season, confirming that N availability is highest 
when soil temperatures are elevated and soil moisture contents are sufficient, and 
coinciding with maximum plant growth rates. Also, differences between the burned 
and unburned pairs were more apparent during the growing season, which further 
supports our hypothesis (1). This was especially true for net N mineralization, 
where 5 of the sites had higher rates in the unburned than the burned sites during 
the growing season, and suggests that distinctions among the net N transformations 
may have been diluted when expressed at the annual scale. In general, the dormant 
season rates were more variable than the growing season rates, which may have 
made treatment differences harder to detect. Approximately half of the annual 
precipitation falls during the summer monsoon season (mid-July to mid-September) 
in this water-limited region (Schubert 1974); this, coupled with higher summer soil 
temperatures, would support higher soil microbial activity during this period (Kaye 
and Hart 1998b), . 
We did not observe a statistically significant time since fire association 
among the differences for either net N mineralization or net nitrification rates, nor 
for NH4+ or N03- pool sizes. In addition, the differences in the relative proportion of 
net N mineralization resulting from net nitrification (net nitrification: net 
mineralization ratio) remained relatively flat over time, demonstrating that net 
nitrification made a substantial contribution to net N mineralization rates in the 
46

burned sites throughout the length of our chronosequence. The lack of temporal 
trends in our data is contrary to our hypotheses (2 and 3) because we expected 
rates of N cycling and pools in burned forests to become similar to unburned forests 
over time since fire, suggesting a relatively slow post-fire recovery of N cycling in 
southwestern ponderosa pine forests. 
We observed a similar lack of temporal trend with time since fire in the gross 
N production rate measurements. Again, the differences over time remained 
relatively constant for both gross N mineralization and gross nitrification rates, 
suggesting persistent differences in mineral N production rates, and providing no 
support for our hypothesis (4). However, the gross N transformations are consistent 
with the net N transformations, suggesting that rates of NH4+ and N03- production 
are driving the observed patterns between treatments and over time since fire. 
It is notable that the ratios of nitrification:N mineralization are generally 
much higher for the gross than the net N transformations. This may have resulted 
from using field incubated, intact cores for the net N transformations and lab 
incubated, sieved soils for the gross N transformations. Nitrogen transformation 
rates measured in mixed soils are not necessarily representative of those in 
undisturbed soils (Booth et al. 2006). In our study, sieving may have increased 
substrate (NH4+) availability to nitrifiers, and thus, stimulating nitrification rates to 
a higher degree for the gross N transformation measurements. 
One potential explanation for the sustained effects of stand-replacing wildfire 
on net and gross nitrification rates is the effect of fire-deposited charcoal. Although 
the exact mechanism has not been identified, charcoal may affect soil processes 
47

through the sorption of phenolic compounds (Zackrisson et al. 1996) or by 
enhancing microbial activity (Pietikainen et al. 2000). DeLuca and Sala (2006) 
demonstrated experimentally that recently deposited charcoal can increase the 
nitrification potentials in unburned forest soils in northwestern ponderosa pine 
forests. However, this effect has not been demonstrated under field conditions. 
We speculate that limited tree regeneration following large, stand-replacing 
wildfires in this region has led to prolonged impacts on N dynamics, and this is 
primarily visible in elevated rates of nitrification. Ponderosa pine forests are known 
to take on various vegetation trajectories following stand-replacing wildfires, 
including grassland, shrub land, or dense forest (Savage and Mast 2005). Natural 
regeneration can be limited in these forests (Heidmann 2008) because it requires a 
specific combination of seed production, weather conditions, and a favorable seed 
bed (Gaines and Shaw 1958). Although cone production in ponderosa pine is 
enhanced by N fertilization (Heidmann et al. 1982), and, thus, may be facilitated 
after wildfire, the widespread fire-induced pine mortality would impede natural 
regeneration. Additioanlly, seedling establishment may depend on a host of other 
factors, including moisture conditions (Gaines and Shaw 1958) and specific 
mycorrhizal linkages (Booth and Hoeksema 2010). 
The post-wildfire vegetation trajectory is thought to drive microbially 
mediated ecosystem processes (Hart et al. 2005), and the shift in vegetation at the 
burned sites may have ecosystem consequences for N retention and cycling. The 
wildfire sites in the current study have little-to-no natural pine regeneration, and 
the resultant shift to an herbaceous-dominated plant community coincides with the 
48

prolonged changes in N transformation rates we observed. As burned sites become 
re-vegetated, we expect plants, especially trees, to be more effective competitors for 
N than heterotrophic microbes over the long term (Johnson 1992). However, a lack 
of tree regeneration at the burned sites in the current study may reduce overall 
ecosystem N demand. When coupled with the sustained increases in N 
transformations rates that we observed, the implication is that considerable N could 
be lost from the site via leaching of N03- or denitrification (Johnson 1992). This may 
be especially critical in ponderosa pine ecosystems because both of these processes 
are enhanced when soils are wet, and the wet growing (monsoon) season coincides 
with greater rates of N transformations in these soils. A major implication of 
progressive ecosystem N loss is an overall reduction in long-term NPP (Vitousek 
and Howarth 1991). 
Our findings contrast with some long-term studies of stand-replacing 
wildfires in the literature, where temporal trends in N availability and net N 
mineralization patterns were observed (DeLuca et a12002; Yermakov and Rothstein 
2006; Turner et al 2007). It is worth noting, however, that the aforementioned 
studies all occurred in northern coniferous forests that are adapted to stand-
replacing wildfire disturbance. Our results are more consistent with those of Duran 
et al. (2009) who observed long-term (> 17 years) effects of stand-replacing 
wildfires on net N transformations in Pinus canariensis forests of the Canary Islands. 
The authors attribute this pattern to changes in soil organic C quality and quantity, 
as well as a lack of understorey vegetation recovery leading to higher soil erosion 
rates.

We observed that elevated rates of net nitrification, and, in some instances, 
gross nitrification, after wildfire are sustained over a long time period in ponderosa 
pine forests. This result is somewhat unexpected given the abundant literature 
showing that prescribed burning effects on N transformations are relatively short 
term (-1 year) in these forests (Kovacic et al. 1986, Covington and Sackett 1992, 
Monleon et al. 1997). However, our results are consistent with those by Grady and 
Hart (2006) wherein they observed elevated rates of net nitrification seven years 
following stand-replacing wildfire in southwestern ponderosa pine forests. 
Furthermore, our results demonstrate that this is a multi-decadal effect. Thus, this 
novel disturbance regime can lead to long-term effects on N cycling dynamics in this 
ecosystem, which may have broader implications for ecosystem N retention and 
associated net primary productivity.

CHAPTER 4 
STAND-REPLACING WILDFIRES ALTER THE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF 
WOOD-DECAY FUNGI IN SOUTHWESTERN PONDEROSA PINE FORESTS 
ABSTRACT 
Increasing tree mortality patterns in the western U.S. due to drought, 
wildfire, and insect outbreaks have widespread implications for ecosystem carbon 
(C) cycling. In particular, the activity of heterotrophic microbes in dead, 
decomposing trees can represent a relatively long-term source of C02 to the 
atmosphere. We used southwestern ponderosa pine forests as a model system to 
investigate the effects of stand-replacing wildfires on the community structure of 
wood-decay fungi. We established a wildfire chronosequence to assess these effects, 
using a combination of culture-based and molecular approaches. Our assessment of 
the fungal decay communities revealed dominance by ascomycete fungi, which 
contrasts with previous studies that used sporocarps. Fire suppressed species 
richness for up to 4 years and altered species composition for the entire length of 
the chronosequence (32 years). An experimental incubation with a subset ofthe 
fungal isolates demonstrated that species varied in their capacity to decompose 
wood. Our results suggest that stand-replacing wildfires have long-term effects on 
fungal community composition, which may have associated consequences for wood 
decomposition and C cycling.

INTRODUCTION 
Tree mortality in the western U.S. has increased in recent years due to a 
combination of drought, insect outbreaks, and wildfire (Westerling et al. 2006, Van 
Mantgem et al. 2009), and these patterns may have profound implications for 
carbon (C) storage and cycling. Severe drought conditions can lead to sudden and 
massive tree species die-off (Breshears et al. 2005), and the climate factors that are 
associated with drought conditions (e.g., warmer spring and summer temperatures, 
lower precipitation) are also correlated with the increasing frequency and size of 
wildfires in the western U.S. (Westerling et al. 2003; 2006). Large, high-severity 
wildfires can have long-term consequences for ecosystem C cycles because they 
often kill trees but do not consume all the tree biomass; the C flux from 
decomposition of these dead trees often exceeds ecosystem photosynthesis rates for 
years to decades (Kashian et al. 2006). The quantity of C02 released by post-fire 
decomposition can be substantial, equaling three times the amount of emissions by 
the fire itself in some forests (Auclair and Carter 1993). The length of time that 
recently burned forests function as net C02 sources is uncertain; high-severity burns 
in mixed conifer and ponderosa pine forests of the Inland Northwest remain net 
atmospheric sources for 4-5 years (Meigs et al. 2009), whereas similar burns in 
southwestern ponderosa pine forests are likely to remain a net source for decades. 
(Dore et al. 2008, Hurteau and Brooks 2011). Clearly, a strong mechanistic 
knowledge of the controls on wood decomposition would enhance our 
understanding of ecosystem C dynamics following high severity wildfires.

Many of the factors that limit the decomposition of wood, including 
colonization by saprotrophic organisms, substrate quality and quantity, and abiotic 
environmental characteristics (Harmon et al. 1986), are likely altered by wildfire. 
Wildfire reduces fungal inoculum sources due to heat-induced mortality (Raison 
1979, Choromanska and DeLuca 2002, Korb et al. 2004); indeed, the maximum 
ground temperatures reached in forest fires range from 200
0 C to 300
0 C (Neary et 
al. 1999), while fungal mortality occurs at temperature <100
0 C (Dunn et al. 1985). 
Reductions of soil-based fungal inoculum by fire make dispersal abilities, either via 
airborne spores, animal transport, or migration of mycelium in the soil, critical to 
fungal establishment on wood. The distance and arrangement of the inoculum 
source are key factors to fungal colonization. For example, in spruce stands of 
central Sweden, the probability of colonization of stumps by basidiomycete fungi of 
the same genet decreased with distance from the point of establishment (Kirby et al. 
1990). Fungi that overcome dispersal limitations in a recently burned area are likely 
to encounter abundant wood substrate, but it will probably be at least partially 
charred. Charring decreases decomposition rates (Cornwell et al. 2009), but may 
provide greater habitat opportunities for microbes because of increased surface 
area (Pietikainen et al. 2000). Finally, post-fire changes in abiotic variables, 
primarily microclimate and nutrient availability, may also alter the responses of 
wood-decaying fungi. Wildfires generally cause an increase in land surface 
temperatures, and they alter chemical characteristics, notably by increasing the pH 
and nutrient availability (Hart et al. 2005); the interactions of all these variables 
may affect the establishment of fungi.

Although the environmental changes resulting from fire are likely to affect 
the diversity and community composition of decay fungi, few studies have examined 
the short- and long-term effects of fire on fungi (Cairney and Basitas 2007). 
Controlled burning in northern coniferous forests favored certain species of fungi, 
causing moderate to strong alterations in community composition (Olsson and 
Jonsson 2010, Berglund et al. 2011). A decline in species richness was observed in 
the first year following burning (Olsson and Jonsson 2010) in one study, but another 
study showed that the number of species recovered within 1 to 5 years following a 
burn (Berglund et al. 2011). The only study we know of that investigated the effects 
of wildfire on wood-decay fungi communities did not observe substantial 
community differences, only that species richness was lower one year after fire 
compared to undisturbed forest (Lumley et al. 2001). 
Fungal community composition of the early succession species may also have 
cascading effects on the composition of later succession fungal communities, and 
this may be reflected in rates of wood decay. Several experimental laboratory 
experiments have confirmed that complex species interactions, including a legacy of 
exudates in the wood, promote the growth of certain secondary fungal species and 
inhibit others (Niemela et al. 1995, Holmer et al. 1997, Heilmann-Clausen and Boddy 
2005). In addition, Fukami et al. (2010) demonstrated that the colonization history 
of fungi led to direct effects on the proportion of wood mass lost during the 
incubation period, suggesting that wildfire effects on fungal community composition 
may have functional consequences. Fungal community structure is thought to be 
more important in the later stages of decay, when the majority of the C remaining is

in the form of lignin (McGuire and Treseder 2009). However, it is clear that early 
successional decomposer communities are instrumental in determining subsequent 
species succession and may have large-scale implications for wood decomposition 
and C cycles (Fukami et al. 2010). 
Southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. scopu[orum Engelm.) 
forests are an excellent model ecosystem to examine wildfire effects on wood 
decomposition and C cycling for numerous reasons. First, ponderosa pine forests 
are widespread in the Southwest, comprising almost half of the commercial forest 
land in Arizona, Utah, New Mexico and Colorado (Schubert 1974). Also, the 
Southwest is predicted to suffer large-scale tree mortality due its high sensitivity to 
drought, predicted increases in ambient temperatures, and the related increases in 
wildfire frequency and bark beetle outbreaks (Williams et al. 2010). The land-use 
history in these forests also has strongly influenced the risk of wildfire and 
associated tree mortality. Historic forests underwent frequent, low-intensity surface 
fires, but the introduction of land management practices (cattle grazing, timber 
harvest, and active fire suppression) by Euro-American settlers led to a shift to 
infrequent, stand-replacing wildfires (Baker 1994, Fleischner 1994, Beschta et al. 
2004). Research on southwestern ponderosa pine ecosystems is relevant to other 
forests in the western u.S. because these land management practices are widely 
applied across the region, and climate models predict widespread drought 
conditions and warmer temperatures (Easterling et al. 2000, Hoerling and Kumar 
2003). Finally, the relatively common incidence of stand-replacing wildfires in the 
last -40 years (Stephens 2005, Littell et al. 2009) has provided the opportunity to 
73

construct a chronosequence of burned sites in which to examine the post-fire legacy 
of decaying wood. 
In this study, we compared the diversity and species composition of wood 
decay fungi associated with wildfires of varying ages to that of nearby unburned 
stands of ponderosa pine in northern Arizona. Relatively little is known about the 
fungi responsible for wood decay in these forests beyond sporocarp surveys 
(Gilbertson 1974), and evidence suggests that sporocarps may not be representative 
of the entire fungal community in wood (Allmer et al. 2006). Therefore, we used a 
combination of mycelial isolation and molecular techniques to identify wood-decay 
fungi community structure. We also measured the decomposition potentials of a 
subset ofthe species observed. We hypothesized (1) that fires would cause a 
decrease in fungal species diversity due to heat-induced mortality and dispersal 
limitations. Concurrently, we expected fire to cause alterations in species 
composition as a result of changes in environmental conditions. We also 
hypothesized (2) that fungal community structure would become more similar with 
increased time since fire, as the effects of fire on the environmental conditions 
diminish, and substrate quality becomes more limiting to fungi than dispersal 
abilities. Finally (3), we hypothesized that the species of fungi we isolated would 
vary in their ability to decompose the same substrate.

northern Arizona, U.S.A. (Table 4.1). Each site had experienced only one stand-
replacing crown fire (> 95% tree mortality) within the last 60 years according to 
forest records (range of burn years: 1977 - 2005). The burned sites were each 
paired with an adjacent unburned site to better isolate the effects of fire and reduce 
other sources of environmental and temporal variation (Johnson and Miyanishi 
2008). All sites were located on basaltic parent material. Woody vegetation in the 
unburned sites consisted of ponderosa pine with some Gambel oak (Quercus 
gambelii Nutt.) at lower elevations and Douglas-fir and southwestern white pine 
(Pseudotsuga menzies;; (Mirb.) Franco and Pinus strobiformis Engelm.) at higher 
elevations. Woody vegetation was limited to small shrubs at all the burned sites 
except at the 1983 burn site, where there were some small ponderosa pine trees. 
Only one of the five sites was subjected to salvage logging following the wildfire, 
the1983 fire. At this site, we sampled from an area on a slope that we are confident 
was not logged based on the lack of stumps and the prevalence of charred logs. 
Therefore, we are confident that the only major disturbance that the sites 
experienced was their respective stand-replacing wildfire. More detailed 
information on site characteristics can be found in Ross et al. (In review). Although 
Ross et al.'s measurements were taken at different locations within the sites than 
those sampled in our current study, all of our samples were taken within 1 km of 
their plots. 
The month we sampled (April, 2009) was drier than average, but 
temperatures were similar to 30-year averages (Western Regional Climate Center, 
Fort Valley Station; www.wrcc.drLedu). The region received 1.7 cm of precipitation

in April of 2009, and the cumulative total for that spring (January - April) was 8.3 
cm compared to the 30-year mean (1971- 2000) for April of 3.2 cm and 21.4 cm for 
the spring. The mean temperature during April 2009 was 4.20 C, while the 30-year 
mean April temperature was 4.50 C. The mean spring temperature for the months of 
January - April, 2009, was 0.90 C, and the 30-year spring mean temperature was 0.50 
C. 
Field sampling and laboratory analyses 
At each site, we selected areas to sample where the fire perimeter could be 
visually delineated. We then established a sampling swath inside the burned area 
between 100 and 300 m from the fire perimeter. Within this swath, we selected 6 
dead and downed tree boles (hereafter referred to as "logs") to sample. Logs were 
chosen based on several criteria: they were representative of those in the burned 
area in terms of size (length and diameter), state of decay (Maser et al. 1979), and 
they were spatially distinct (logs were sampled in groups of 2; each log pair was 
approximately 100 m from the others). Four cubic samples, each approximately 6 x 
8 x 1.5 cm, were removed from each log using a chainsaw or bow saw and a hatchet. 
One sample was taken at each end of the log, and the other two samples were evenly 
spaced across the length of the log. All samples were removed from the highest 
point along the side of the log. We recorded log length, diameter (both ends and 
middle), aspect, and state of decay. We calculated log volume using the formula for 
the volume of a frustum (V = n*length/3 (n 2 +rzz + rlrz), wherein "r" equaled the 
radius at either end.

We followed a similar procedure in each of the adjacent unburned areas in 
that we established a swath between 100 and 300 m from the burn perimeter. To 
reduce variation in fungal community composition that might be associated with log 
size and age, we sampled logs that were similar in size and state of decay as those 
we sampled in the burned area. All wood pieces were placed in polyethylene bags 
and transported on ice back to the lab and stored at 4Â° C until processing Â« 10 
days). 
To isolate fungi from within the wood samples, a small piece (5 x 5 x 10 mm) 
was removed from each wood sample using a coping saw. The wood sample was 
surface sterilized by briefly dipping in 70% ethanol and then burning off the ethanol 
with a flame. The wood segments were immediately placed on a sterile petri dish 
containing Hagem agar (Allmer et al. 2006) and monitored for hyphal growth. 
Emerging hyphae were placed in pure culture on Hagem agar and grouped by their 
morphology. A total of 240 wood pieces from 60 logs were plated (6 logs per site). 
Multiple representatives from each culture morphotype were selected for 
DNA extraction. A small portion of hyphae was scraped off the culture using a sterile 
knife (approximately 0.5 g) and placed in a 96-well DNA extraction plate. The DNA 
was then extracted using Qiagen DNEasy (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) plant kits 
according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the modification recommended 
for fungal tissue. The internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal DNA was 
amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the forward ITSIF (5'-
CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3') and reverse ITS4 (5'-
TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3') primer pair (Gardes and Bruns 1993). Restriction

fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) data were obtained following the methods of 
Gehring et al. (1998) using restriction enzyme digestion with HinjI and MboI, and 
morphological groupings were confirmed using the distinctive RFLP band patterns 
(RFLP types). 
The ITS region from no fewer than two representatives of each RFLP type 
was sequenced. Forward and reverse sequencing was performed on an ABI 3730 
Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) at the Environmental 
Genetics and Genomics Laboratory (Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ, 
USA). Sequences were aligned and edited using Geneious Pro software (Drummond 
et al. 2010). BLAST searches were also performed using Geneious and the GenBank 
database (http://www.ncbLnlm.nih.gov). Sequences with similar BLAST results 
were aligned using Geneious Consensus alignment to verify their similarity (>97.0% 
pairwise identity). Final morphological groupings were determined using the 
sequence results, and samples that did not amplify or did not yield a high quality 
sequence were grouped based on RFLP pattern and culture morphology. 
Fungal community composition was analyzed using PC-ORO software 
(McCune and Mefford 2006). Each log was considered a plot and species were 
collapsed into genera because it reduced the number of singletons. Collapsing 
samples into genera had no effect on the general conclusions drawn in other studies 
of wood-decay fungi (Crawford et al. 1990). We used a 2-way factorial PerMAN OVA 
(Anderson 2001) with treatment (burned or unburned control) and year of fire as 
the main effects. We encountered a significant treatment X year interaction (p = 
0.0002), so we subsequently analyzed the effects of treatment and year separately

using a multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP). An indicator species 
analysis (Dufrene and Legendre 1997) was conducted based on the year of burn and 
burned or unburned control. Because of the high diversity in the fungal 
communities, in addition to the inherent spatial variability, we set the a priori alpha 
level at 0.10 for the community analyses. 
Species richness and Shannon's diversity index (H'; computed in PC-ORO) 
were computed for each log (as a plot) and differences were analyzed using a 2-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) in IMP statistical software (SAS Institute; Version 
5.0.1.2). Treatment (burned or unburned control) and year of burn were the main 
effects. Upon encountering a significant treatment X time interaction (p = 0.009 for 
species richness, p = 0.021 for H'), we examined each burn/control pair separately 
for each fire year. Temporal changes in the burned sites were assessed for both 
species richness and H' using a one-way ANOVA with burn year as the main effect, 
and means were separated using Tukey's HSO. Species richness and H' were 
computed for each site, and these values were used to compare burned and 
unburned treatments using a paired t-test. Sampling effort was assessed by 
producing species accumulation curves for the burned and unburned treatments. 
The influence of environmental variables (log length, volume, aspect, organic 
horizon C and woody debris C) on fungal community composition was assessed 
using a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMOS) ordination in PC-ORO. The 
secondary environmental matrix was overlaid on the species matrix and 
correlations between the environmental variables and species composition were 
displayed as joint biplots (Murray et al. 2010). Correlations coefficients (r) ~ 0.669

(burned/unburned separately) or;?: 0.497 (burned and unburned together) were 
considered significant at alpha = 0.1 based on a table of critical values (df = 5 or df = 
10) Separate ordinations were performed for the burned sites, the unburned sites, 
and the combined dataset for the burned and unburned sites. 
Lab incubation to assess the decomposition capabilities of fungal isolates 
To further explore the role of individual species of fungi on wood 
decomposition, we experimentally measured the decomposition of standard pine 
dowels following inoculation with isolates of individual species that were frequently 
found in our field study. We selected 8 species that were dominant in a range of 
burn ages. We placed five (5 x 5 x 5 mm) cubes of hypha I-rich agar onto nutrient-
poor media (Bacto-Agar). We obtained pine dowels (8 mm diameter; 
www.dowelsondemand.com). cut them into 8 mm lengths, and sterilized them in an 
autoclave. Five pieces of wood were weighed together and then placed in the media 
such that each wood piece was situated next to one of the five agar cubes. In total, 
10 plates were made for each ofthe 8 morphotypes (n = 10). 
Plates were monitored for fungal colonization of the wood pieces for six 
months and 15 days before harvesting. The five wood pieces contained in each plate 
were removed from the petri dish and placed together in a small envelope. The 
wood pieces were dried at 60Â° C for 48 hours, and then any fungal hyphae 
remaining on the wood were scraped off using a sterile knife. The wood pieces were 
weighed and decomposition was measured as the percentage of initial mass loss. A 
one-way ANOVA was used to compare the percentage mass loss across the species 
and Tukey's HSD was used to separate differences.

RESULTS 
We isolated fungi from 222 ofthe 240 wood samples (92.5%), 109 from 
burned sites and 114 from control sites. Only one species of fungus was isolated 
from most ofthe wood samples (62%); ofthe remaining samples, 27% had two 
species isolated, 10% had three, and 1 % had four. 
We sequenced a total of 280 samples, and almost three-quarters (203) of 
them yielded high quality DNA sequences. We observed 68 distinct fungal taxa; 43 
were identified to species, five were identified to genus, one was identified to family, 
and the remaining taxa (20), mostly singletons, remained unidentified (Table 4.2). 
Of these, 42 were members of the division Ascomycota, five were members of the 
division Basidiomycota, and two were members of the Mucormycotina (formerly 
part of the Zygomycota). 
There was no consistent effect of burning on fungal species richness or 
diversity across all of the sites, but some sites differed significantly from their 
paired unburned controls. Mean site level species richness did not differ between 
burned (18.4 species) and unburned (16.4 species) treatments (p = 0.60). Similarly, 
Shannon's diversity did not vary between the burned (1.1444) and unburned 
(1.2012) treatments (p = 0.803). At the log spatial-scale, mean species richness was 
lower at the burned than the unburned site at the 2005 burn (p = 0.07), and it was 
higher at the burned than the unburned site in the 1984 burn (p = 0.0006). For the 
other three burns, species richness was similar at the burned and unburned sites 
(Figure 4.1). Shannon's diversity index at the log spatial-scale was higher in the 
burned sites than unburned sites at years 2000 and 1983 (Table 4.3).

Community composition showed more consistent differences between 
unburned and burned sites. Species composition differed significantly between four 
of the five burned and unburned site pairs (Figure 4.2). The indicator species 
analysis revealed several species as indicators for particular burn and year 
combinations. Aspergillus sp., Hypocrea sp., and unknown Phialophora were 
indicators of the 1984, 2005, and 1996 burns, respectively. In the unburned sites, 
Biscogniauxia mediterranea was an indicator of 1996, while both Byssochlamys nivea 
and Pezizomycotina spp. were indicators of 1984 (Table 4.4). 
Mean species richness (at the log level) varied by year in the burned sites (p 
= 0.002), as did H' (p = 0.007). Richness was significantly lower at the 2005 site than 
the 2000, 1996, and 1983 sites, but similar to the 1977 site. The 1997 site was 
similar to all of the other burned sites (Figure 4.2). An identical pattern was 
revealed for H'. Species richness was similar at all the unburned sites. Shannon's 
diversity index was higher at the 1996 unburned site than the 1983; the rest of the 
sites were similar to each other. Community composition at the burned sites varied 
with time since fire (A = 0.0985, P < 0.0001; Figure 4.3A); pairwise comparisons 
showed that community composition differed among all site pairs except for 1984 
and 1977. The unburned sites also were distinct from each other in community 
composition (A = 0.1178, P < 0.0001; Figure 4.38) except at the two most recent 
years, 2005 and 2000. None of the environmental variables (log length, diameter, 
aspect, organic horizon C and woody debris C) were significantly correlated with an 
ordination axis (axis 1 or axis 2) for ordinations using data from the burned, 
unburned, or burned and unburned sites combined. The species accumulation

curves for both the burned and unburned treatments exhibited an asymptotic trend 
(Figure 4.4). 
All of the fungal species tested were able to decompose the wood substrate, 
but the percent of initial mass that was lost ranged from 1. 7% to 11.1% and varied 
by species. The wood colonized by Hypocrea lixii was less decomposed than the 
other species tested, which were not significantly different from each other (Figure 
4.5). 
DISCUSSION 
Our findings partially support our first hypothesis, that wildfire would cause 
a decrease in species richness. Average species richness per log was lower at the 
most recent fire site (2005) compared with its paired unburned site (Figure 4.3). 
Although our sampling occurred four years following this fire, we were still able to 
capture limited evidence of a decline in richness caused by fire. Our findings 
contrast with other studies that documented fungal communities after prescribed 
burning in boreal forests. For instance, Ohlsson and Jonsson (2011) found that 
species richness was similar in burned and unburned plots four years post-burn, 
and Junninen et al. (2008) did not observe differences in species richness one year 
following fire. However, these studies examined the impact of prescribed burning, a 
much weaker disturbance than a high-severity wildfire. We also observed that the 
species richness at the 1984 burned site was higher than the unburned site. We 
attribute this to the high relative abundance of one species, Byssochlamys nivea, in 
the unburned site, which may indicate that this species is occupying a 
disproportionate amount of niche space compared to the paired burned site (Figure 
83

2D). Byssochlamys nivea is a known inhibitor of some fungal pathogens (Hoff et al. 
2004), which may enhance its abilities to outcompete other decomposer fungi. 
Fungal community composition differed in burned sites compared to their 
unburned pairs at all the sites except for the 1996 burn, providing support for our 
first hypothesis that community composition would differ as result of fire. Other 
researchers also have found that prescribed burning caused alterations in fungal 
species composition up to four or five years post-fire (Junninen et al. 2008, Olsson 
and Jonsson 2010, Berglund et al. 2011), but ours is the first research we know of to 
demonstrate altered community composition up to 32 years (1977) after a stand-
replacing wildfire. The relatively high number of species observed at the 1996 sites 
suggests a high degree of species co-existence. Similarly, Jonsson et al. (2008) 
observed higher species co-existence at intermediate stages of wood-decay, 
suggesting a higher degree of niche availability in these logs. The majority ofthe logs 
sampled at the 1996 sites were of the intermediate decay class 3. This could explain 
the high level of species co-existence at the 1996 sites; however, we are unable to 
demonstrate this empirically. 
We observed a high degree of heterogeneity in the species composition 
among the unburned sites, which could be a result of spatial or environmental 
variation across sites. Another source of variation among the unburned sites may be 
high levels of forest organic material in the unburned sites (as compared to the 
burned). Tedersoo et al. (2008) demonstrated that the most common 
ectomycorrhizal fungal species in decaying wood were also common in the forest 
floor material. Also, the forest floor may be an underestimated source of inoculum of 
84

wood-inhabiting species (Allmer et at. 2009). Together, these studies demonstrate a 
strong link between fungi in the litter layer and that in decaying wood. In our study, 
it is possible that organic material is such a rich source of inoculum in the unburned 
sites, and, as such, it facilitates a much larger degree of community heterogeneity 
than we expected. But, given this high degree of dissimilarity, we cannot be 
completely certain that the differences we observed in composition between burned 
and unburned sites are due to the effect of the fire, and not simply an artifact of high 
variability in this region. 
Post-fire fungal colonization may be limited by the relative scarcity of soil 
organic material in the forest floor in burned areas compared to unburned forests. 
Because pine regeneration is extremely slow following stand-replacing wildfires in 
southwestern ponderosa pine (Heidmann 2008), it is likely that levels of organic 
material will remain low for an extended period following this type of fire. Low 
levels of organic material were observed at our burned study sites by Ross et at. (In 
Review, Table 1), which may explain the long-term alterations in fungal species 
composition that we observed. 
We observed distinctive fungal species composition at the three recent burns 
(2005, 2000, and 1996), but similar compositions at the two older burns (1984 and 
1977; Figure 4.1), which provides support for our second hypothesis, that fungal 
communities would become more similar with time since fire. These results are 
consistent with Rajala et at. (2010) who observed a succession of fungal species 
over the course of log decay in spruce forests. The more decomposed logs had 
similar community composition. The authors suggest that airborne colonization by 
85

fungal spores is maximized after a certain point in wood decomposition, resulting in 
a more stable community structure at later stages of decay (Rajala et al. 2010). 
Our finding, that Hypocrea sp. decomposed wood about five times slower 
than the other seven species of fungi we tested, partially supported our third 
hypothesis (Figure 4.4). Members ofthe genus Hypocrea are cosmopolitan soil-
borne fungi also common on decaying wood (Druzhinina and Kubicek 2005). 
However, members of the order Hypocreales, to which the Hypocrea belong, do not 
possess strong abilities to decompose wood substrates (Worrall et al. 1997). This 
suggests that members of the genus Hypocrea are rapid colonizers and generalists, 
but may lack the enzymatic capacity to process complex C. We also observed that 
members of the Hypocrea genus were an indicator for the most recent burn (2005) 
and had a high relative abundance there (Figure 4.2; Table 4.4). Consistent with our 
findings, members of the anamorph of this genus, Trichoderma, have been observed 
in high abundance in soil following prescribed burning (Froelich et al. 1978). 
The remaining species that we tested experimentally all decomposed the 
wood to a similar degree, suggesting some functional redundancy among the species 
we tested. Similar studies have found more variability in decomposition abilities 
among fungal species. In a microcosm experiment, (Clinton et al. 2009) found that 
fungal species varied widely in their abilities to decay Nothofagus wood. Worrall et 
al (1997) tested a variety of fungi from different taxonomic orders and also 
observed varying degrees of ability to decay pine wood. Notably, they found an 
intermediate ability in members of the order Sordariales, of which three ofthe 
species we tested are members (Chaetomium sp., Coniochaeta ligniaria, and 
86

Neurospora terricola). In particular, we expected Coniochaeta ligniaria to 
demonstrate strong decomposition abilities since it is an ascomycete that produces 
some ofthe enzymes required for lignin degradation (Lopez et al. 2007). We also 
expected Penicillium corylophilum to exhibit high decomposition based on results by 
Allison et al. (2009),where they observed that Penicillium sp. exhibited strong 
abilities to decay spruce wood. However, our experiment was short-term and it only 
assessed the initial stages of decay, and, therefore, may not be indicative of longer-
term wood decay. 
The inferences we can draw from our single species incubations are also 
limited because we could not include interactions among species of decay fungi, 
which are complex and usually antagonistic (Boddy 2000). Although the precise 
mechnanism is not entirely understood, it is thought that the production of 
secondary metabolites by earlier colonizing fungi can have inhibitive or stimulative 
effects on the growth of successive colonizers in wood (Heilmann-Clausen and 
Boddy 2005). This predecessor legacy effect is substantial; indeed, it has been 
shown to influence fungal community structure and associated decomposition rates 
in wood (Fukami et al. 2010). Clearly, interspecific interactions are an important 
consideration for assessing a species decay capacity, and this is a factor that should 
be incorporated into future research. 
Our study is limited in that we were only able to identify those fungal species 
that grew in culture; therefore, our analysis missed any species that were not able to 
exploit the media. Extraction of fungal DNA directly from wood pieces followed by 
one of several advanced molecular techniques (cloning and sequencing, Terminal 
87

RFLP, DGGE, high throughput sequencing) would potentially be able to identify 
more species. However, when some of these methods were compared (sporocarp 
collection, culturing, and T-RFLP), the combination of sporocarps and culturing 
identified more species than T-RFLP; in fact, T-RFLP only revealed one taxa that had 
not been identified by either of the other two methods (Allmer et al. 2006). Further, 
the asymptotic trend in our species accumulation curves suggests that our culture 
work was able to adequately capture the fungal species present. This evidence, 
coupled with the high diversity we observed in the present study, makes us 
confident that we have identified real patterns in fungal community composition. 
This research is the first we know of to assess the community structure of 
wood-decay fungi in southwestern ponderosa pine forests using mycelial isolation 
and molecular techniques. Indeed, the only other assessment for this region was 
limited to sporocarop surveys and only included basidiomycetes (Gilbertson 1974). 
Our results show a dominance of ascomycetes compared to basidiomycetes in these 
logs; indeed, only two species (Dichomitus squalens and Gloeophyllum saepiarium) 
and one genera (Coniophora) overlap between the two studies. This comparison 
emphasizes the importance of utilizing both traditional and molecular techniques in 
characterizing wood-decay fungal communities, especially in semi-arid climates. 
The findings presented here are early reports for a field of ecology that is 
being transformed by the capability of molecular techniques to rapidly and 
accurately identify fungal communities. As such, our results will be useful for future 
hypothesis generating because they can be widely applied to wood decomposition, C 
cycling, and stand-replacing wildfire disturbance. Our results suggest stand-

replacing wildfire disturbance may have substantial, long-term impacts on these 
communities. Species richness recovered relatively slowly, as compared to studies 
of prescribed burning in boreal forests. Also, the species composition in the burned 
areas was persistently different from comparable unburned areas, up to 32 years 
after a wildfire. These findings may have wide implications for post-wildfire C 
cycling because differences in species composition may lead to alterations in wood 
decomposition rates (Fukami et al. 2010). In particular, the increasing frequency 
and size of stand-replacing wildfires in the western u.S. suggests that there will be 
larger amounts of C stored in the decaying wood in the future. Our research suggests 
a deficiency in current global C models that could be ameliorated with more 
information on the community structure of wood-decaying fungi (McGuire and 
Treseder 2010).

FIGURE LEGENDS 
Figure 4.1 Species richness of wood-decay fungi at each burned (closed bars) and 
unburned (open bars) at each ofthe five chronosequence sites. Asterisk indicates 
differences between the burn and unburned treatment at each year. Each bar 
represents the mean of six logs sampled per site, and error bars represent Â± 1 
standard error. 
Figure 4.2 Percent relative abundance of all the fungal species at burned (closed 
bars) and unburned sites (open bars) at each of the five chronosequence sites (A-E; 
2005,2000, 1996, 1984, 1977, respectively). Relative abundance was computed for 
each unburned and burned site separately. Species are arranged in order of 
decreasing relative abundance beginning with the unburned sites. Statistics shown 
(A and P values) are the results of MRPP analysis comparing the community 
structure at each burned and unburned area. 
Figure 4.3 Non-metric multidimensional scaling of wood-decay fungi community 
composition in burned (A) and unburned (B) sites. The final stress after 250 runs

Each centroid is the mean of a site in ordination space, and bars represent Â± 1 
standard error. Six logs were sampled per site and four wood pieces were taken 
from each log (n = 6). Results of MRPP analysis confirmed that the 2005, 2000, and 
1996 burns differed compositionally from each other, and the 1984 and 1977 burns 
were similar in composition. MRPP analysis on the unburned sites confirmed that 
the 2000 and 2005 sites were similar compositionally, while the 1996, 1984, and 
1977 were distinct.

WILDFIRE AND FOREST MANAGEMENT INFLUENCES ON FINE ROOT 
DECOMPOSITION AND SOIL MICROBIAL BIOMASS POOLS IN SOUTHWESTERN 
PONDEROSA PINE FORESTS 
ABSTRACT 
The decomposition of fine roots is an essential component of nutrient cycling 
in terrestrial ecosystems, but the rate of this flux and the factors that regulate it are 
poorly understood compared to our knowledge of aboveground leaf litter decay. We 
evaluated the effects of different forest management regimes on rates of fine root 
decomposition and associated soil microbial carbon (C) pools in southwestern 
ponderosa pine forests. We selected stands that had previously undergone various 
management treatments (unmanaged, thinned, thinned/prescribed burned, and 
wildfire) and installed steel-walled cylinders (trenches) into the ground to sever 
fine roots. We hypothesized that rates of fine root decomposition would increase 
with the degree of disturbance across the treated stands: highest at the wildfire site 
and lowest at the unmanaged site. Additionally, we hypothesized that microbial C 
would be lowest where the fine root decomposition rate was the highest because 
the trenches would prevent new belowground C inputs as a substrate for microbial 
maintenance and growth. To evaluate these hypotheses, we sampled soil inside the 
trenches at 5 and 27 months following trench installation, and measured fine root 
biomass and microbial biomass C pools. We compared these measurements to soil 
samples taken outside the trenches at the 5 month sample date and calculated fine 
root decomposition rates. Over the 27 -month period, rates of fine root

decomposition did not differ among management treatments, but herbaceous roots 
decomposed significantly faster than pine roots. Microbial C pools were lower inside 
the trenches at the wildfire sites than the unmanaged and thinned sites at 5 months, 
but pools were similar across all management treatments at 27 months. We 
observed a significant positive correlation between fine root decay constants and 
microbial C (r = 0.35; p = 0.01) across all the management treatments, suggesting 
that soil microbes are limited by root-derived labile C. The higher nutrient 
concentrations and rates of decomposition of fine roots than leaf litter in this region, 
coupled with the relatively comparable inputs of these two types of detritus to the 
soil, suggest that fine root turnover is integral to the maintenance of soil fertility in 
these forest ecosystems.

INTRODUCTION 
Fine root decomposition is an important source of nutrients and organic 
matter for soils in many forest ecosystems (McClaugherty et al., 1984; Silver and 
Vogt, 1993; Berg et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2002; Hart et al., 200Sa), but it may be of 
particular importance following disturbance. Natural or anthropogenic 
disturbances, such as wildfires, hurricanes, or tree harvest cause a reduction in 
aboveground litter inputs to the soil because of a reduction in stand growth; 
however, the belowground decay of fine root material following the disturbance 
may buffer the ecosystem against these sudden declines in aboveground nutrient 
return (Fahey et al., 1988). Decaying fine roots provide a flush of labile carbon (C) 
for maintaining microbial activity and soil organic matter pools. However, the 
pattern of fine root decay may depend on the type, severity, and spatial scale of the 
disturbance (Silver and Vogt, 1993). For example, landscape-level disturbances from 
high-severity wildfire may cause greater reductions in fine root biomass than 
smaller, more localized disturbances from tree thinning or prescribed burning (Hart 
et al., 200Sa; Dore et al., 2008; Selmants et al., 2008; Sullivan et al., 2008). 
Extended fire exclusion in southwestern ponderosa pine forests has led to 
significant changes in stand structure, which contribute to the increase of 
uncharacteristically large and severe wildfires in this region (Covington and Moore, 
1994). The goal of many recent forest management efforts in southwestern 
ponderosa pine is to reduce the likelihood of stand-replacing, catastrophic wildfires 
and to restore these forests to their historic stand structure, composition, and 
function (Covington et al., 1997; Allen et al., 2002). These management treatments,

primarily a combination of thinning and burning, promote higher quality litter 
inputs by increasing herbaceous productivity (Kaye et al., 2005; Sabo et al., 2008), 
however, comparatively little is known regarding how these treatments influence 
the turnover of fine roots. For instance, Hart et al. (2005a) did not observe 
differences in fine root decay between control and repeatedly burned plots, but 
their study was limited to one growing season. In similar forests, Selmants et al. 
(2008) found that fine root biomass decreased as a result of forest restoration 
treatments, but their study did not quantify the rate of fine root production or 
decay. 
Although fine root dynamics may significantly influence nutrient cycling 
following forest management activities, such as tree thinning and prescribed 
burning (Hart et al., 2005a; Kaye et al., 2005), few studies have evaluated fine root 
decomposition across a range of disturbances within a similar habitat (Fahey et al., 
1988; Silver and Vogt 1993; Hart et al., 2005). Fewer still have linked fine root decay 
to microbial C, despite evidence suggesting that the exclusion of fine roots can alter 
microbial community composition (Brant et al., 2006) and reduce C02 efflux and 
microbial biomass (Li et al., 2005). 
We assessed the linkages between fine root decay and microbial biomass C 
under the premise that if fine roots are a significant C source for microbes, then 
changes in fine root biomass should be closely coupled to changes in microbial 
biomass C. We employed several different forest management treatments in 
southwestern ponderosa pine as a framework for examining this link because the 
treatments (unmanaged, thinned, thinned and burned, and wildfire) provide a 
119

gradient of soil C availability, in both C quantity and quality (Grady and Hart, 2006). 
We hypothesized that rates of fine root decomposition would increase with the 
degree of disturbance across these stands: highest at the wildfire stand, 
intermediate in the thinned and thinned and burned, and lowest in the unmanaged 
stands. The basis for this prediction was twofold: 1) an increase in soil temperature 
and N availability that occurs in these forests with increasing disturbance (Hart et 
al., 200Sb; Grady and Hart, 2006), and 2) a concomitant increase in the relative 
cover of herbaceous understory species (Grady and Hart, 2006; Sabo et al., 2008), 
which have a higher substrate quality for decomposing organisms than pine roots 
(Kaye and Hart, 1998a). Higher soil temperature, N availability, and root litter 
quality in more disturbed stands should all contribute to faster rates of fine root 
decomposition (Gill and Jackson, 2000; Silver and Miya, 2001). We also 
hypothesized that, because soil microbial C pools are coupled to plant litter inputs 
(Zak et al., 1994; Grady and Hart, 2006; Li et al., 2010), changes in microbial C pools 
would covary with changes in fine root biomass. If soil microorganisms are truly 
maintained via access to fine root C, then we would expect to find a correlation 
between fine root biomass and microbial biomass C. We predicted that levels of 
microbial biomass C would be lowest in stands where decomposition is the fastest 
(wildfire), intermediate where decomposition is intermediate (thinned and thinned 
and burned) and highest where decomposition is the slowest (unmanaged).

METHODS 
Study site and forest treatments description 
This study was conducted in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. 
scopulorum Engelm.) forests in the Coconino National Forest of northern Arizona, 
USA, near the city of Flagstaff (35Â° 8' N, 111Â° 39' W). Historically (1909-2000), 
annual precipitation in this region averaged 56.6 cm and annual air temperature 
averaged 6.3Â°C (Fort Valley Arizona Meteorological Data (FVAMD), 2006). 
Precipitation during our study period (2004, 2005 and 2006) was 43.7 cm, 54.6 cm, 
and 38.6 cm respectively, and mean annual air temperature was 5.9Â°C, 6.5Â°C, and 
6.8Â°C respectively (FVAMD, 2006). Elevations across stands ranged from 2160 to 
2440 m. Monsoonal rains are common in the southwestern USA between 
approximately mid-July and September, with approximately half the yearly 
precipitation occurring during this season. 
Ponderosa pine is the dominant overstory vegetation in all stands except in 
the wildfire stands where the overs tory is absent (but was previously ponderosa 
pine). The understory community is dominated by Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica 
Vasey) and mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia montana Hitch.) in unmanaged, thinned, 
and thinned and burned stands, and by squirreltail (Elymus elymoides (Raf.) 
Swezey), foxtail (Hordeumjubatum L.) and cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) in 
wildfire stands (Sabo et aI., 2009). Soils are Typic Argiborolls and Mollic 
Eutroboralfs, with flow basalt and basaltic cinders as the parent materials (Miller et 
aI., 1995).

We used the experimental sites of Grady and Hart (2006), where plots were 
established across replicated stands with different management histories (e.g., 
thinning, thinning/burning) or wildfire}. The forest treatments were part of the 
Stand Treatment Impacts on Forest Health (STIFH) study, designed to evaluate the 
effects of thinning, prescribed burning, and wildfire on ecosystem structure and 
function (Bailey et al., 2001). A retrospective approach was employed to quantify 
the long-term effects of silvicultural treatments (as surrogates for forest 
restoration) and wildfire. 
We randomly selected four stands from each ofthe following four forest 
treatment groups (2:20 ha each within 750 km2 landscape area, and out of a 
potential pool'of 10 of each treatment group). 
â¢ 
Unmanaged stands (UN) - stands dominated by dense patches of even-aged, 
small diameter ponderosa pine trees Â« 40 cm diameter at breast height [1.37 
m]) that had not received a density altering treatment within the last 30 years, 
such that the stands had> 90% crown closure. Mean basal area in UN stands was 
35 m2/ha and tree density averaged 815 trees/ha. 
â¢ 
Thinned stands (TH) - stands of even-aged ponderosa pine trees as above, 
with greater than 30% basal area removed between 1988 and 1995, of which 
50% or more came from diameter classes < 30 cm. The percent of basal area 
removed in TH stands ranged from 32 to 59% with a mean of 40%. 
â¢ 
Thinned and burned stands (TB) - stands like those from TH above that also 
received a broadcast burn treatment within three to four years following

thinning (1989 to 1997). The percent of basal area removed in TB stands ranged 
from 33 to 70% and averaged 57%. 
â¢ 
Wildfire stands (WF) - similar to unmanaged stands prior to being consumed 
by the Hochderffer stand-replacing wildfire in 1996. Ponderosa pine tree 
mortality was greater than 90%. This wildfire site was selected because it 
occurred at about the same time as the other treatments. 
Sampling design 
Within each replicate stand of each treatment, we sampled from three plots, 
spaced between 150 to 1000 m apart. These plot data were averaged to calculate 
the responses for each of the four replicate stands in each treatment (n = 4). 
We used root trenches to assess fine root (~2-mm diameter) decomposition 
and associated changes in microbial C. These trenches were installed in May of 
2004. Their original intent was to sever all fine roots, and thus allow the partitioning 
of heterotrophic and autotrophic soil respiration rates (Hanson et al., 2000). The 
trenches consisted of thin-walled (-1.6 mm) steel cylinders, 20.3 cm in diameter. 
The cylinders were driven into the soil to a depth of 35 cm using a steel driving cap 
and a sledgehammer. Because of the methodological similarity between the 
cylinders and traditional trenches (e. g., Silver and Vogt, 1993), we will refer 
hereafter to the cylinders as "trenches." 
We made several assumptions to estimate fine root decomposition rates 
using the trenched plots. First, we assumed that the trench installation killed all fine 
roots, which allowed us to calculate decomposition as the difference between the 
root mass in the soil outside the cylinder (untrenched) and that inside the cylinder

(trenched). We also assumed that, by randomly assigning the trench locations, the 
fine root biomass was the same among the treatments before the trenches were 
installed. Finally, we assumed that the fine root biomass did not change outside the 
trenches (untrenched) from the time the trenches were installed until the first 
sampling date (after 5 months). Previous work in ponderosa pine forests in this 
region suggests that fine root biomass pools are not very dynamic over one growing 
season (Hart et al., 200sa). Furthermore, we tested the statistical similarity of fine 
root biomass outside the trenches at the two sampling dates (5- and 27-months) 
using a 2-way analysis of variance with sample date and forest treatment as effects. 
The fine root biomasses of the untrenched soils were statistically similar between 
these two time periods (p = 0.741), and there was no significant sample date x forest 
treatment interaction. Therefore, we are confident that fine root biomass outside of 
the trenches (untrenched) did not change substantially during the first five months 
following trench installation, and we proceeded to use the untrenched biomass at 5 
months as our initial fine root biomass pool size for estimating fine root 
decomposition. 
Fine root and microbial biomass 
We took two mineral soil cores (4.8 cm dia. x 15 cm depth) from inside and in 
the immediate vicinity (within 0.5 m) outside the trenches in October 2004 and 
August 2006 (5 and 27 months after trenching, respectively). One core from each 
trenched and untrenched pair was used for estimating fine root biomass. Two plots 
had herbaceous plants growing inside the trench at the 27 month sample date, and, 
thus, were excluded from all subsequent analyses.

We separated fine roots from the mineral soil using a hydro-pneumatic 
elutriator (Scienceware Bel-Art products, Pequannock, N.J., USA; Hart et al., 2005a). 
At the 5-month sampling, all roots, live and dead, were separated from other organic 
material using a shallow pan containing deionized water. At the 27-month sampling, 
the roots were further separated by vegetation type: pine and herbaceous. This 
separation was guided by root morphological differences between the two types of 
vegetation (e.g., the dichotomous branching structure of the pine roots versus the 
irregular branching patterns of the herbaceous roots; Kaye and Hart, 1998b). All 
fine roots were oven dried at 70Â°C for 48 h and then weighed. A decomposition 
constant (k, year-I) was calculated for each forest treatment assuming that mass loss 
fit a single exponential decomposition model (Olson, 1963). The decomposition 
constant was calculated for the total (live + dead) fine root biomass based on the 
difference between the untrenched fine root biomass at the 5-month reference time 
and the trenched fine root biomass at the two sampling times. The decomposition 
constants for the herbaceous and pine fine root biomasses were calculated using the 
difference between the trenched and untrenched biomass values at 27 months 
because roots were not separated by type at the earlier sample date. 
Soil samples taken from the second core from each trenched and untrenched 
pair were immediately extracted for microbial C using the chloroform (CHCb) 
fumigation-extraction method (Brookes et al., 1985; Vance et al., 1987; Haubensak 
et al., 2002). Soil samples were sieved Â« 4 mm), and approximately 30 g of field-
moist soil was extracted with 100 mL of 0.5 M KzS04. A second 30-g subsample of 
mineral soil was also placed inside a desiccator with a beaker containing 30 mL of 
125

ethanol-free CHCh. The desiccator was repeatedly evacuated to boil the CHCh and 
then left under vacuum for 5 days (Haubensak et al., 2002). After 5 days, the CHCh 
was removed from the soil by repeated evacuations and then soil subsamples were 
immediately extracted with 100 mL of 0.5 M KZS04. Extracts were shaken on a 
reciprocating shaker for one h, filtered with Whatman #1 filters (pre-leached with 
deionized water), and frozen until analysis. 
Organic C concentrations in un fumigated and fumigated extracts were 
determined by ultraviolet-enhanced persulfate oxidation using a Dohrmann DC-80 
Carbon Analyzer with infrared detection (Tekmar-Dohrmann, Cincinnati, OH, USA). 
Soil microbial C was computed by the difference between the unfumigated and 
fumigated extracts. We used a kec of 0.39 (Sparling et al., 1980) to convert 
fumigation C flushes to microbial C. 
Statistical analysis 
We analyzed fine root biomass, microbial biomass, and gravimetric water 
content (GWC) by forest management type across the three sample dates 
(untrenched,5 months after trenching, and 27 months after trenching). For these 
variables, we used repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) and 
Greenhouse-Geissner adjustments to account for autocorrelation over time, and 
tested for forest management treatment and time main effects and their 
interactions. Significant forest management treatment effects were followed by 
additional one-way ANOVAs for each sample date and Tukey's Honestly Significant 
Difference (HSD) mUltiple comparisons to separate treatment means. We also 
calculated Pearson's correlation coefficients to examine the relationship between 
126

fine root biomass and microbial biomass C pools across all forest management 
treatments. 
We analyzed the effects of forest treatment on the 27-month decomposition 
rate constants, k, using two approaches. For the total fine root decomposition rate 
constant, we used a one-way ANOYA with management treatment as the main effect. 
For the pine and herbaceous k values, we used a two-way ANOYA with root type and 
management treatment as the main effects, and their interaction. When the overall 
model was significant, Tukey's HSD mUltiple comparisons were used to separate 
means among treatments. All statistical analyses were performed using JMP 5.0.1.2 
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA), and an alpha level of 0.05 was used to determine 
statistical significance. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Fine root decomposition 
Substrate quality is an important driver of fine root decomposition (Gholz et 
al., 2000; Silver and Miya, 2001; Parton, et al., 2007), and we expected the 
previously observed differences in dominant vegetation across the treatment 
gradient (Sabo et al., 2009) to be reflected in the rates of fine root decomposition. 
Specifically, we expected the highly disturbed wildfire site to exhibit the highest rate 
of fine root decomposition because of its increased amounts of herbaceous 
vegetation, higher soil N availability and higher soil temperatures compared to the 
other three sites. However, our analysis demonstrated that forest management 
treatment did not affect fine root decomposition in this study. We subsequently 
analyzed the rates of pine and herbaceous decomposition separately by pooling 
127

each root type across all forest treatments at the 27-month sample date. In this 
analysis, we found that the herbaceous fine roots decayed faster than the pine (p < 
0.0001). Thus, the ostensibly low fine root biomass at the wildfire site (Figure 5.1) 
compared to the other treatments suggests that perhaps the low statistical power of 
our study (n = 4) limited our ability to detect management differences. 
The range of fine root decomposition rates we observed for ponderosa pine 
(wildfire = 0.10 y.l; unmanaged = 0.35 y.l; Table 5.1) are consistent with rates found 
for conifers at regional and global scales, as well as across methodologies. 
Decomposition rates of between 0.48 y.l (control) and 0.73 y-l (repeatedly burned) 
have been reported for southwestern ponderosa pine forests (Hart et aI., 2005a). In 
addition, the percent of fine root biomass remaining (data not shown) is also similar 
to values reported for ponderosa pine in the Pacific Northwest over a similar time 
period (Chen et aI., 2002). At larger scales, the decomposition rates we observed are 
comparable to those for conifer species in other temperate ecosystems (0.18 - 0.29 
y-l; Hobbie et aI., 2010), and the overall global mean for conifers (0.17 y-l; Silver and 
Miya, 2001). Since nearly all ofthe above-mentioned studies used the litterbag 
method, it is useful to note that the trench method we employed yielded comparable 
results to litterbags. 
Our research demonstrates that fine root turnover is a more important 
source of nutrients and soil organic matter in this ecosystem than comparable leaf 
litter. Although inputs from fine roots and foliage are similar in unmanaged and 
thinned southwestern ponderosa pine forests (Kaye et aI., 2005), the rates of pine 
fine root decomposition we observed are generally faster than those reported for 
128

ponderosa pine needle litter (Klemmedson, et al., 1985; Hart et al., 2005b). 
Furthermore, the net release of N from fine roots is higher than that of comparable 
needle litter during decomposition in these forests (Wright, 1996; Hart et al., 
2005b). Taken together, this evidence suggests that fine root inputs to nutrient 
cycling processes and soil organic matter may be greater than those from needle 
litter in these ecosystems. 
Coupling of fine root decomposition and microbial biomass C pools within 
forest management treatments 
Patterns in microbial C pools provide limited support for our hypothesis that 
microbial biomass C levels would be lowest at the wildfire stands, highest at the 
unmanaged stands and intermediate at the thinned and thinned/burned. Unlike fine 
root decomposition, microbial biomass C differed among management treatments 
(p = 0.02; Figure 5.2). The untrenched samples had the greatest treatment 
differences, wherein microbial biomass C was significantly lower at the wildfire site 
than the unmanaged and thinned sites. This pattern is consistent with previous 
findings by Grady and Hart (2006) for untrenched soils at the same study plots. 
Treatment differences in the current study were also evident at the 5-month sample 
date, where the wildfire site had lower microbial biomass C than the thinned site. 
Microbial biomass C decreased over time across all the management 
treatments (untrenched > trenched 5 months> trenched 27 months; p < 0.0001; 
Figure 2). This decline suggests a progressive constraint of labile C on soil microbial 
activity over the course of our study (Zak et al., 1994). Because fine root turnover is 
thought to cycle soil C more rapidly than associated aboveground plant litter (Ruess 
129

et al., 2003), it is likely that fine root material is an important source ofthis 
belowground labile C for soil microbes (Hart and Sollins, 1998; Li et al., 2010). The 
trenches limited new belowground C inputs from fine roots, and may have increased 
nutrient availability and soil moisture content (Fisher and Gosz, 1986), all of which 
are artifacts of the study design. However, we found a decrease in GWC over time 
inside the trenches (p < 0.001), but no effect of management treatment (Table 5.1). 
This suggests the lack of active roots inside the trenches did not increase the soil 
moisture content, which could have led to higher microbial biomass C and 
accelerated fine root decomposition. Furthermore, because both fine root biomass 
and microbial biomass C declined over time inside the trenches, we argue that soil 
microbes in these forests are highly constrained by belowground labile C inputs 
from fine roots (either from root exudation or decomposition), regardless of the 
management treatment imposed. 
To further explore the link between belowground microorganisms and C 
inputs from fine roots, we analyzed correlations between fine root biomass and 
microbial biomass C. There was a significant correlation between fine root biomass 
and microbial biomass C when all treatments were pooled together across all 
sample dates (Figure 5.3; r = 0.35, P = 0.01, n = 48); however, a substantial portion 
of the variation (-88%) was still unexplained. When the two variables were 
analyzed separately for each management treatment, only the unmanaged 
treatment had a significant correlation (r = 0.62; p = 0.03, n = 12). The thinned 
treatment was marginally significant (r = 0.46; P = 0.13, n = 12), while the 
thinned/burned and wildfire treatments were not Significantly correlated. This 
130

pattern suggests that the larger management disturbances (wildfire and 
thinning/burning) uncoupled the C supply as a controller of microbial biomass C, 
and this may explain some of the variation in the correlation analysis. We also think 
that the relationship between fine root biomass and microbial biomass C became 
weaker at the wildfire site because the same conditions we expected to enhance 
decomposition (higher N availability, surface temperatures and litter quality) were 
offset by the lower abundance of decomposers. Finally, the two variables may be 
controlled by different factors; our research shows that microbial biomass C is 
linked to fine root-derived labile C availability while fine root decomposition may be 
a function of changes in microclimate or substrate quality (Silver and Miya, 2001), 
both of which were not measured in our study. 
CONCLUSIONS 
This is one of few existing studies to quantify fine root decomposition and 
associated microbial biomass C pools under common forest management 
treatments, and our findings suggest that fine root turnover is an important 
component of nutrient cycling in these forests. Fine root decomposition may 
represent a substantial portion of terrestrial C fluxes and source of mineral 
nutrients (Silver and Miya, 2001; Fornara et al., 2009), and our research emphasizes 
the importance of considering belowground organic matter inputs and turnover 
when making management decisions. Despite the lack of statistical difference in fine 
root decomposition among the forest treatments, we found that herbaceous roots 
decomposed faster than pine; therefore, we recommend implementing silvicultural 
treatments that open forest canopies and encourage the development of herbaceous

understory to promote dynamic nutrient cycling. Furthermore, these treatments 
reduce the risks of catastrophic wildfires, which, in turn, reduce soil microbial 
biomass C and may have long-term implications for microbial community dynamics.

of forest management treatment. Forest treatment did not affect the fine root biomass (pine, herbaceous or total) or the 
associated rates of decomposition; however, when all treatments were pooled together, herbaceous roots decomposed 
significantly faster than pine roots (p < 0.0001; n = 16)

CHAPTER 6 
OVERALL SUMMARY AND MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS 
The results of my dissertation studies underscore the broad effects of stand-
replacing wildfire in southwestern ponderosa pine forests from several different 
ecosystem and community level perspectives. In particular, they demonstrate that 
severe wildfire influences nitrogen (N) cycling and wood-decay fungi communities 
for multiple decades, and may alter fine root decomposition rates via a shift in 
vegetation type from pines to herbaceous plants. Importantly, they suggest the 
effects of stand-replacing wildfires on these ecosystems are persistent, perhaps 
multi-decadal. The broad implications for management include both minimizing the 
risks of this type of wildfire (an uncharacteristic disturbance in these ecosystems), 
as well as adapting management practices for alternative stable states when type 
conversions result from stand-replacing wildfires. 
As suggested in Chapter Three, tree regeneration following stand-replacing 
wildfires in southwestern ponderosa pine forest is limited. In the past, burned areas 
were usually salvage logged and replanted, but planting resulted in varying degrees 
of success. Even the burned sites in this dissertation research that were successfully 
replanted have had limited recovery in their soil organic horizon. The paucity of tree 
regeneration and associated lower levels of soil organic material appear to be 
important controllers of the ecosystem alterations we observed. 
The results in Chapter Three suggest that elevated levels of nitrification at 
burned sites can be explained by these post-fire shifts in vegetation, which result in 
a dominance by herbaceous biomass. This may have implications for wider 
145

ecosystem functioning because of an overall decrease in plant demand for N 
compared to undisturbed forest. This decrease in plant-demand, coupled with 
elevated rates of nitrification, may result in long-term losses of N from the 
ecosystem via leaching of N03-. The consequence of this may be lower rates of net 
primary productivity and associated reductions in atmospheric C02 fixed by plants. 
Overall, this suggests that these wildfires lead to long-term effects on carbon (C) 
cycles, and this may be at least partially due to elevated rates of N cycling. 
In Chapter Four, I observed different fungal community structures in burned 
sites compared to unburned sites, which may be partially due to reductions in tree 
regeneration and associated soil organic material. Soil organic material is a rich 
source of fungal propagules and energy for heterotrophs in undisturbed forest, and 
the relative lack of it in burned areas may result in altered fungal community 
structure. Although the specific mechanisms are not well-understood, it is possible, 
given the complex interactions of fungi during succession and associated 
implications for wood decomposition rates, that the community-level differences we 
observed may result in ecosystem level differences in decomposition rates. This is 
an area of research that begs for more work because of the implications for global C 
cycles. 
The results in Chapter Five demonstrate the importance of wildfire-related 
vegetation shifts to organic matter turnover belowground. In one of few existing 
studies to quantify fine root decomposition rates, I observed that herbaceous roots 
decompose faster than pine roots. Although this was not reflected in a statistically 
significant treatment effect, it suggests that organic matter turnover and subsequent 
146

nutrient release may be more rapid in burned areas because of the higher substrate 
quality of herbaceous fine roots. Again, these results may have implications for 
global C cycles because of faster belowground organic matter turnover. 
The implications of this dissertation for management are two-fold. First, my 
research suggests that avoidance of catastrophic wildfires in this region may be the 
single best way to maintain forested landscapes. However, extended fire exclusion 
in this region has led alterations in stand structure, with associated consequences 
for ecosystem functioning (Kaye et al. 2005). Forest management practices in semi-
arid climates that utilize a combination of thinning and burning to treat high-density 
forest stands are likely to suffer less tree mortality during a wildfire than untreated 
forests (North and Hurteau 2011), which may mitigate some of the long-term effects 
of stand-replacing wildfires. Furthermore, these types of treatments restore some of 
the ecosystem functions of the historic fire regime. I suggest that the areas most 
vulnerable to wildfire be prioritized for treatments to be most effective at 
preventing catastrophic wildfires at the landscape level. 
Secondly, these results suggest that land managers need to be prepared for 
what to expect following stand-replacing wildfire. Our research supports the work 
of others in suggesting that many of these forests do not necessarily recover along a 
predictable successional trajectory back to a forested state. Instead, some burned 
areas appear to transition to alternative stable states, such as grassland or 
shrub land (Savage and Mast 2005), and this is reflected in both their N cycling and C 
storage. Therefore, managers should practice adaptive management in burned 
regions to maintain vital ecosystem functions (e.g., watershed and soil health and

al. 2010).
