Abstract: Open pile burning (OPB) forest residues have been limited due to several concerns,
including atmospheric pollution, risk of ﬁre spread, and weather conditions restrictions. Air Curtain
Burner (ACB) systems could be an alternative to OPB and can avoid some of the negative effects that
may result from OPB. The main objective was to compare the burning consumption rates and costs
of two types of ACB machines, the S-220 and BurnBoss. In addition, we tested a hand-pile burning
(HPB) consumption rate for a comparison with BurnBoss unit. The S-220’s burning consumption
rates ranged between 5.7 and 6.8 green metric ton (GmT)/scheduled machine hour (SMH) at a cost
between US $12.8 and US $10.8/GmT, respectively. Costs were 70% higher when using the BurnBoss
unit. Burning residue consumption rates and cost of disposal were considerably different: they were
highly dependent on machine size, species, and fuel age of forest residues. Particularly, BurnBoss test
burned over 40% more than HPB method and produced clean burn by airﬂow. The results from this
study suggest that ACBs can be a useful tool to dispose of forest residues piled in many forests areas
with less concerns of air quality and ﬁre escape risks.

1. Introduction
Forest residues include tree tops, limbs, and other tree parts generated from forest operations
and can provide opportunities for production of bioenergy and bioproducts such as briquettes or
biochar [1–3]. However, a low level of market demand for wood-based energy in the Northwestern
U.S. have caused forest residues to be piled and left in the forests and sawmills [4]. It is also often
ﬁnancially unviable to use forest residues due to high costs of collection and transportation, and low
market price [5,6]. In addition, leaving large piles of forest residues near houses or within public parks
have been a concern due to high risk of ﬁre hazard and other forest management issues (i.e., growing
and rehabilitation). For this reason, open pile burning (OPB) has been widely used in the Western
U.S. to dispose of forest residues, to reduce wildﬁre hazard, and improve forest and productivity [7,8].
This forest residues disposal method has been extensively used as it provides a cost-effective option
for disposal of forest residues [9,10].
However, OPB could be potentially damaging to forests by increasing the wildﬁre hazard and
obstructing regeneration [11,12]. This method has not only been shown to generate greenhouse gas
(i.e., carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2)) emissions and release particulate matter (PM)
to the health hazard levels, but it also emits nuisance of smoke and objectionable odor to an ambient
air [10,13]. For this reason, intentional burning of slash piles was often strictly controlled in public
and residential areas [13]. OPB also requires the prevention of embers from escaping as well as
monitoring weather conditions hourly: burning is allowed only if extremely narrow conditions are
met [14,15]. For example, when planning a pile burn, ambient temperatures have to be less than 32 ◦C,

the maximum wind speed should not exceed 8 km/h and relative humidity ought to be below 35%.
These requirements would prohibit OPB from 1 June to 14 November in most areas in the Western
U.S. Another drawback of OPB is the severe, undesirable effects on forest soil properties compared
to wildﬁres or broadcast burning [12,16]. The extreme ﬂaming temperatures (400 ◦C) with 60 h can
be intense and penetrate at 0–20 cm soil depth which can destroy the chemical and biological soil
properties [17]. Overall, the OPB method can result in poor air quality, smoke production, ﬁre escape,
and soil damage [7,18].
An alternative technology to dispose of forest residues is to use an Air Curtain Burner (ACB),
which is designed by Air Burners Inc., Palm City, FL, USA (also called as Air Curtain Destructor or
Incinerator; Figure 1). ACBs are divided into two main types, stationary (positioned at the centralized
landing area) and mobile applications (half-ton pick-up truck mounted system). These machines were
developed in compliance with US Environmental Protection Agency’s 40 Code of Federal Regulation
Part 60 regulation that determines allowable emissions from biomass burning [19,20].

Figure 1. The Air Curtain Burners used to test burning of forest residues in (a) S-220 in Jacksonville,
Florida; (b) BurnBoss in Groveland, California; and (c) BurnBoss installed with ember screen in Volcano,
California. The loader is used to load the forest residues in S-220 operation while BurnBoss operation
is loaded by hand.
ACBs have been primarily used to dispose of woody residues, such as stumps and root wads [21],
waste wood and landscape wastes [22], debris generated by hurricanes [23] and ﬂoating (water-borne)
woody debris from natural disasters (e.g., tsunami and heavy rainfall) [19]. Details on how the ACBs
FireBox efﬁciently burn woody materials is shown in Figure 2. These machines operate by blocking
various air pollutant emissions including greenhouse gases and PM by using a high velocity (1600–2000
revolution per minute; RPM) of airﬂow from the air blower part which is referred to as “air curtain”.
In addition, air pollutant emissions is returned by circulation of air ﬂow. Past studies showed that
ACBs can reduce CO and PM emissions by 80% compared to OPB and reduce smoke opacity [23,24].
In addition, it also minimizes escaping embers, soil damage, and burn scars by creating an air curtain
across the box [23,25,26]. Air Burners Inc. stated that adding air into the FireBox effectively improved
burning consumption rate since by adding more oxygen to the forest residue pile in the FireBox during
the burning [19]. As a result, ACB’s forest residues treatment method is considered as a clean and air
pollution control burning method to dispose of forest residues, but burning consumption rates and
cost of disposal of forest residues for different ACB systems are largely unknown.

Therefore, in this study, we examined an alternative method of disposing of forest residues using
an ACB (Figure 3). The overall objective was to determine the performance of ACBs and evaluate the
economic feasibility of burning slash piles using the S-220 and BurnBoss, which are ACB models that
are commonly used for forest residue disposal. Speciﬁcally, this study sought to: (1) determine the
forest residues burning consumption rate (green metric ton (GmT)/scheduled machine hour (SMH))
and cost of disposing forest residues ($/GmT) through ﬁeld-based experiments, and (2) establish the
logistics to an ACB burning operation. This study focused on disposal of forest residues resulting from
fuels reduction treatments in green waste yards near residential areas and public parks. In order to
assess the potential of BurnBoss units, we observed hand-built-pile burn’s consumption rate next to
the BurnBoss test at the same time.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. An ACB Burning System Set-Up and Description
During the study, we noticed that ACB operations followed ﬁve steps: putting the machine in
place, ﬁrst loading and kindling, air blower startup, loading (i.e., second loading), and burning it down

Forests 2017, 8, 296

to ash. For an initial set up of an ACB operation, these machines need to be placed on open, clear, ﬂat
ground (slope < 10%) with dry surface conditions [27]. The area should be located at least 30 m away
from the outer edge of burning materials and any ﬁre fuel [28].
Following the set-up, the operator needed to ﬁll up a space in the ground and the inside of the
FireBox with dirt to prevent the escape of smoke and embers since the FireBox is bottomless. The ﬁrst
loading, which is piled about 1/3 of the FireBox height consists of smaller materials (less than 10 cm in
diameter) for kindling, and is then ignited with diesel fuel and a propane gas torch. At this time in the
burning, greenhouse gases and smoke can temporarily be generated as the diesel fuel ignites, as there
is some wait time for the materials to ignite. If the operator uses clean materials with lower moisture
content (<20%) at this stage, there will be reduced emissions of CO and PM with the smoke [27,29,30].
For this reason, the materials used were not contaminated with dirt. Thus, prior to the start of air
blower, a number of preparation activities should be done, including site selection, set-up, and kindle
a ﬁre. Further, ﬁrst loading and kindling work can vary depending on operator and machines.
The next process for the burning is to turn on the air blower and load additional residues into the
FireBox as needed to maintain combustion until the materials are burned down to ash. It should be
noted that the second and following loadings should not be higher than the height of the box to retain
the emissions, ember, and smoke reduction by the air curtain [19]. These processes are dependent on
the type of ACB; S-type (i.e., S-220) and BurnBoss. S-220 burning operation, in which a large amount
of residues were fed to a 0.5-m height below the top at a time with 25-GmT amount of residues, had
a burn down time of approximately 14 h before the next experiment [31]. Thus, the S-220 or other
S-types of ACB are designed to run for one day (24 h). On the other hand, when loading fuels with the
BurnBoss, they should be added to 1/3 the depth of the FireBox and additional fuels added when there
is enough space [27,32]. These processes were repeated until the last materials were loaded. Once the
last materials were loaded, the last stage should take one or two hours to burn it down to ash. Thus,
BurnBoss unit can be operated for eight hours a day.
2.2. Description of ACBs Used in the Experiments
The S-220 was a mid-sized model equipped with a 45-kW diesel engine to blow air into the FireBox.
The dimensions of the FireBox used in the S-220 are 6.0-m × 1.9-m × 2.2-m (length × width × height)
with 0.7-m thick steel walls ﬁlled with thermo-ceramic materials. This machine type can efﬁciently
dispose of larger diameter (>20 cm) forest residues [26]. A potential average through-put of burning
ranges from 5 to 7 GmT/h at an average fuel consumption rate of 9.5 L/h [19].
The BurnBoss was a portable prototype machine that can be moved around with a half-ton
pick-up truck and a FireBox that is raised and lowered by a hydraulic lift system.
This unit
is only applied to off-road vehicles that do not exceed 60 km/h.
The FireBox dimensions are
3.7-m (L) × 1.2-m (W) × 1.2-m (H) with 0.1-m thick thermos-ceramic material walls. It had a small
(9-kW) diesel engine with a fuel consumption rate estimated at 1.1 L/h [19]. Generally, the burning
consumption rate of this technology is approximately 1/2 to 1 GmT/h. The BurnBoss unit was typically
loaded by hand with small (<20 cm) forest residues such as hand-pile residues and windrow along the
road during the burning process.
2.3. Description of Material Types Used in the Experiments
Burning tests were conducted using two ACB machines, S-220 and BurnBoss, in three different
locations. The ﬁrst test was conducted over three days (4–6 August 2015) on a S-220 unit in a green
waste yard located in Jacksonville, Florida. The S-220 unit was positioned at a designated location
such as large green waste disposal yard or a large open area for an extended time (>6 months or
year) and was used in conjunction with a rubber-tired front-end loader using a standard log grapple.
The species burned for this study were loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), laurel oak (Quercus laurifolia), sand
live oak (Quercus geminate), and myrtle oak (Quercus myrtifolia) trees. These materials were mainly
chunk woods ranging 20 to 40 cm in diameter and 1 to 3 m in length, collected from in-forest, mill

processing, and urban wood residues (Table 1). For the purpose of our study, we separated the wood
fuels into three different types (softwood, hardwood, and mixed species) at an amount of 25 GmT for
each burning trial test. There was no signiﬁcant difference in the size and moisture content of fuel
types (p > 0.05).

A second burning test was carried out over two days (26–27 March 2016) with a BurnBoss unit
in a community green waste yard area in Groveland, California (CA). Forest residues used for this
test were from urban and residential ﬁre hazard reduction and landscaping treatments, and consisted
of Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa, 80%) mixed with manzanita shrubs (Arctostaphylos glauca, 20%)
that were less than 6-months in age. A backhoe sorted and piled approximately 10 GmT of two
different fuel sizes; small-diameter fuels (<10 cm) and large-diameter fuels (10–20 cm). Larger than
10 cm fuels in diameter ranged from 1 to 2 m in length, while less than 10 cm materials were in
a variety of lengths and forms. The third burning experiment was conducted in a California State
Park camp ground located in Volcano, CA, USA over three days (13–15 June 2016). The BurnBoss
used for this test was equipped with a cage placed on the top of the FireBox to prevent any embers
from ﬂying from the FireBox (Figure 2). An ember screen is optional to buy and helps avoid the
spread of ember during the loading and burning process [19]. At this site, three different types of
fresh (less than one-month-old or immediately after felling and bucking fuels) and 12-months-old
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) residues from commercial thinning operations were burned (Table 1).
The 12-months-old residues burned were only large-diameter (10–20 cm). Fresh residues, which were
from drought or insect damage, were burned immediately after felling and bucking and included small
(<10 cm) and large-diameter (10–20 cm). Large fuels were generally around 1 m in length, but small
materials were in a variety of lengths and forms including leaves. There was a signiﬁcant difference in
the moisture content of fuel depending on age (p < 0.05).
In both BurnBoss tests, we compared burning consumption rates with hand-pile burning (HPB)
option when burning forest residues on a site. For the purpose of comparison of consumption rates,
the HPB was set next to the ACB unit observed at each day of burning (Figure 4). The HPB was
3.7-m wide × 1.2-m long × 1.2-m high.

2.4. Field Data Collection and Analysis
Prior to burning, the fuel material types were characterized by material species and diameter
for each experiment. To measure burning consumption rates, fuel weights were measured with a
PT300TM RFX portable wheel-load scale (Intercomp, Medina, MN, USA) installed on site. The weight
of testing material used for this study was pre-measured and prepared by the research collaborator,
following the researchers’ requests. Before each burning test, moisture content was measured with
a BD-2100 moisture meter (Delmhorst Instrument CO., Towaco, NJ, USA) by sampling 2 cm thick
cookies of fuel samples for the greater than 10 cm slash piles. For materials less than 10 cm in diameter,
we sampled portions of branches and needles to measure moisture contents. All samples were dried at
105 ◦C for 48 h since it was doubtful to measure a moisture content of fuels. Water content was not
statistically different between BD-2100 and sampling methods (p > 0.05). When performing each test
we also collected weather condition data such as air temperature, humidity, and wind speed using a
Kestrel 3000 (Nielsen-Kellerman Co., Boothwyn, PA, USA) (Table 1).
ACBs’ burning consumption rates (GmT/SMH) for each equipment and material were calculated
using a time and motion study method. The burning times were recorded to the hundredths of a
minute using a stopwatch. We recorded for second loading and burning time only, excluding the
time prior to starting the air blower and burndown stage. This is because the preparation process
was totally independent from operator control in the studied work phase. In addition, although
S-220 and BurnBoss use the same principal of ACB for its burning mechanism, loading and the last
stage, burndown, were different. For this reason, pure burning cycle times were recorded from air
blower startup to second loading (from turned on air blower to when last fuels were loaded) during
the ACB burning. The following describes how the S-220, BurnBoss, and HPB burning cycle times
were measured:
•
S-220 burning cycle time: For the S-220 burning test, we started recording the burning time when
the air blower was turned on and stopped right after the last materials were loaded. Further,
to determine the pure burning cycle time, second loading and waiting times sum up to gross-cycle
times and determine to SMH.
•
BurnBoss burning cycle time: For the BurnBoss burning test, we started recording the burning
time when the air blower was turned on and stopped right after the last materials were
loaded, producing comparable burning consumption rates (S-220 vs. BurnBoss). In addition,
we continuously recorded until the materials were burned down completely to ash, because we
also focused on feasibility to compare the burning consumption rates of BurnBoss with HPB.

Forests 2017, 8, 296

•
HPB burning cycle time: We started recording the burning time when a second loading started
and completed our time measurement when the materials were burned down completely to ash.
Thus, to determine the pure burning cycle time of HPB, second loading and perfectly combustion
times sum up to gross-cycle times and determine to SMH. Additionally, when there were partially
burned larger materials (>10 cm) in the pile, we picked them up and weighed them for evaluating
the burning consumption rate of HPB.
Every test started with a “cold start” method, which means that each burn started on the bare
ground (i.e., no ash from a previous ﬁre) and required the ignition of kindling, followed by the addition
of larger fuels until the ﬁre continued on its own.
The machine rate calculation methods were used to evaluate hourly machine costs for the
ACBs [33]. Fuel consumption rate, machine utilization rate, and wage were collected from the
contractors (Table 2). Overhead or indirect, proﬁt allowance cost, move-in, and transportation of
residues costs were not obtained. Thus, total system costs included only the operational costs associated
with supporting equipment (loader and personnel pick-up truck).

In addition, during the BurnBoss and HPB tests, we measured the ﬂaming temperature (◦C) using
a Therma CAM SC640 IR camera (FLIR Systems, North Billerica, MA, USA) and Amprobe IR-750
thermometer (Amprove, Everett, WA, USA) in 10-min intervals until ﬂame-out for each experiment.
We recorded above the top of the FireBox and piles.
3. Results
The inventory data in Table 3 describe an ACB’s burning consumption rates and cost. The S-220
unit was capable of burning rates of 5.7 to 6.8 GmT/SMH at a cost of US $12.8 and $10.8/GmT,
respectively (Table 3). These burning operations (softwood, hardwood, and mixed species) indicated
that combustion of softwood residues was 15% more efﬁcient than both materials. During these trial
tests, burning consumption rates strongly depended on the species. However, there was no signiﬁcant
difference in the moisture content of fuel sizes (p > 0.05).
In the BurnBoss tests in Groveland and Volcano, the machine’s combustion rate of disposal
ranged between 0.6 to 1.7 GmT/SMH at a cost between US $17.9 and $47.7/GmT, respectively (Table 3).
The results indicated that there was no considerable difference in burning consumption rate between
fuel size (diameter) less than 10 cm and 10–20 cm under less than 6-months age or fresh conditions.
However, noticeable differences were detected by fuel age (fresh vs. 12-months-old) in Volcano. When
burning 12-months-old residues after the fuel reduction operations, burning consumption rates were
70% greater compared to fresher fuels with a higher moisture content (27% and 36%). In addition,
costs were high (US $47.7/GmT) when disposing of the fresh material.

study (Table 3). However, the average combustion temperature was not signiﬁcantly different between
the two burning options (p > 0.05). The smoke as indicated by pictures, is low for BurnBoss burning,
which produced plumes with very low opacity only during the air blower start (Figure 4). For this
reason, the ACB burning system was more an efﬁcient and environmentally sound option to dispose
of forest residues.

4. Discussion and Conclusions
Utilizing forest residues for production of bioenergy and bioproducts effectively reduce the ﬁre
hazard and emissions from OPB, but collection and transportation of forest residues to power plants is
often cost-prohibitive [4]. For this reason, one of the options used to reduce a huge amount of woody
residues is to incinerate fuels. However, OPB has restrictions and challenges including ﬁre hazards
and emissions. The main contribution of this study was to introduce the environmental friendly forest
residue disposal option of using an ACB and evaluate the economic feasibility. Therefore, this study
was designed to evaluate two types of ACBs (S-220 and BurnBoss) and compare one with pile burning
using a variety of forest residue types. We focused on a burning consumption rate based on the time to
consume the materials loaded until the last materials are loaded. The ACB’s burning consumption
rates ranged between 0.6 and 6.8 GmT of forest residues/SMH at a cost US $47.5 and US $10.8/GmT,
respectively. The S-220 offers a higher (85%) burning consumption rate and incurs a lower cost than
the BurnBoss. The BurnBoss’s burning consumption rate was 40–80% greater than HPB in this case
study. In addition, BurnBoss burning produced much less smoke than the HPB.
We noticed that the S-220 unit was a good ﬁt with a centralized operation with forest residues
delivered for burning, while the BurnBoss could be frequently moved to the place where forest residues
are located. For this reason, we do not suggest that one of the machines might be more effective than the
other. However, it would be helpful to see the burning consumption rates and disposal costs of ACBs to
select an optimal unit that meets operational needs. The burning consumption rate of the BurnBoss unit
was smaller in quantity of fuels than the S-220 operation during our burning tests. A BurnBoss machine
can be cost-effectively used to access the location where a small volume of fuels (e.g., hand-piled slash,
small forest residues volumes along a roadside, and a few scattered drought/insect damaged trees
in public parks) are piled and left for disposal. However, these options are often not carried out on

Forests 2017, 8, 296

harvesting sites due to the inaccessibility of forest roads such as steep, narrow, and winding conditions
and tended to produce higher transportation cost of forest residues [34,35]. Particularly, in the Western
U.S., a typical chip-van had limited access to harvest units due to forest roads that were constructed for
a stinger-steered logging truck [35]. BurnBoss machines are easily transported with half-ton pick-up
trucks [19]. For this reason, this unit was effectively used to remove forest residues that were not
accessible with size reduction machines. In addition, it is effective for disposal of small volume of
fuels such as hand-pile slash, paper trays or small forest residues volumes along a roadside, and a few
scattered drought/insect damaged trees in public parks, which improves ﬁnancial viability. On the
other hand, the S-220 offers other applications and has the potential to succeed where there are large
amounts of fuels on landing areas and high wildﬁre risk areas without local bioenergy facilities.
The burning rate or ﬂammability was affected by species [36], moisture content or fuel ages [37,38],
and airﬂow rate [39].
The caloriﬁc heating values (CV), which is deﬁned as the amount of
generating heat energy while a fuel is completely burned, were dependent on the species composition
including differences in lignin content, hemicellulose, and density [40–42]. A softwood had a 10%
greater CV because of the higher lignin content and lower hemicellulose and density than most
hardwood [36,42,43]. Therefore, with S-220 burning activities, softwood burning rate was much higher
than hardwood and mixed fuel tests, which explains in part the increase in CV for softwood burning
relative to hardwood and mixed residues burning activities.
Moisture in fuels is one of the most important parameters in its combustion process and fresh
fuels will not burn easily [44]. Dimitrakopoulos et al. [45] found that slash piles wetted could lead to
a reduction in the combustion efﬁciency and obstruct ignition. During the BurnBoss tests, burning
consumption rates were 2–3 times greater when disposing of 12-months-old material (17% moisture
content) because the dry fuels require a shorter residence time to burn down to completion compared
to fresh materials. Even though several studies indicated that material properties including size and
volume were the primary factor driving burning rate [46], tree size did not have any effect in this case
study. Thus, we noticed that dried forest residues led to shorter times for the materials to burn down
completely to ash.
Previous studies have been carried out to observe the inﬂuence of airﬂow rate on burning
rates [47,48]. If the amount of air supplied is increased, the combustion rate is greater than a critical
ﬂow rate [47–49]. Particularly, the high velocity airﬂow creating the air circulation supplied an
oxygen-enriched environment in the FireBox that accelerated the burning process on ACBs burning
system [23,26]. In addition, the high airﬂow tends to be attributable to a greater burning rates causing
a larger high heat transfer from the ﬂame [24,39], even though the ﬂame temperature were not
signiﬁcantly different between the BurnBoss and HPB burning tests in this case study. On the other
hand, OPB of fuels was limited by the supply of sufﬁcient oxygen in natural (open-air) condition [50].
As a result, this high-speed air blower boosted and burned fuels more quickly and improved the
burning consumption rates since the airﬂow rate was better than natural conditions.
ACB machine application can block the fugitive air pollutant emissions into the atmosphere
since high velocity air created an air curtain on top of the FireBox [22,23,26]. Four previous studies,
Fountainhead Engineering, Inc. [22], Zahn [24], Schapiro [26], and Miller and Lemieux (2007) found
that ACB burning methods produced fewer greenhouse gases (i.e., CO), smoke (i.e., PM), and 90%
less opacity than OPB when the air blower velocity was 1600 or 2000 RPM. Therefore, ACB operations
were typically more efﬁcient (e.g., reduction air pollutant emissions and smoke) within an incinerator
compared with an OPB [19,23]. Further, it is expected that burning disposal methods will be adopted in
forests to reduce potential environmental and ﬁre hazards especially at the wildland-urban interfaces.
In conclusions, this was the ﬁrst study to evaluate the burning consumption rates and costs of an
ACB to better understand a centralized biomass disposal operation concept (S-220) and movable and
mounted on a pick-up truck prototype (BurnBoss) machines. This study’s ﬁndings have shown that
S-220 and BurnBoss burning had considerably different burning consumption rates and disposing costs.
Therefore, forest managers should consider the potential beneﬁts and limitations of each machine to

justify optimization efforts. For example, the BurnBoss is accessible to remote areas by a pick-up truck
and suited for disposing of small size and volume forest residues. The ACB burning option seems to be
commonly adopted in many forests to control emissions, smoke, and embers and to improve oxygen
and heat supply by high velocity of airﬂow during the burn. Thus, this technology would be much
more efﬁcient and reduces the negative environmental and societal impact of burning forest residues.
Further study is need to compare the weather condition, fuel age, amount of fuel load (i.e., second
loading volume) to ﬁnd the burning rates.
