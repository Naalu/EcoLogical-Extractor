Fact Sheet: Understanding Fire and Fire Behavior 
 
Fire always obeys the laws of physics, and is always made up of three elements: fuel, oxygen, 
and heat. How it behaves on the landscape can be unpredictable. Yet people can, to an extent, 
shape how fire moves through a landscape, even one as large as southwestern ponderosa pine 
forests. 
 
Wildland Fire Basics 
 
 Fire comes in different forms: it can smolder on the ground for days or race through tree 
crowns in minutes.1 Ground fires that burn mainly grasses and downed pine needles are 
considered typical for healthy ponderosa pine forests in the Southwest. Today, however, 
many fires in the region are crown fires that consume entire trees and pose a danger to human 
lives and communities.2

 Fire behavior changes with the fire’s environment. Topography, weather, fuel, and the fire 
itself all influence fire behavior. As these variables interact, fire behavior will change.  
 
 Fire spreads most rapidly downwind and upslope. The fastest-spreading part of the 
perimeter is called the front or head; the slowest-spreading part is called the back. The 
lateral portions, or flanks, spread at intermediate rates. Fires n the Southwest often move 
from southwest to northeast due to the prevailing winds during fire season in May and June. 
 
 Fire doesn’t spread only along its edge. In general, fire grows by igniting new fuel along its 
outer perimeter. However, it may spread more rapidly by producing embers or sparks that are 
carried by wind and the fire’s convection column. The 1967 Sundance Fire traveled 16 miles 
in 9 hours, created “spot fires” 10 to 12 miles from the place of origin, and overall moved at 
an average rate of 1 to 6 miles per hour.

 Fire can create its own environment. Heating from the fire can produce local winds, create 
atmospheric instability, and cause cumulus clouds to develop. In an extreme state, a “plume-
dominated fire” (e.g., the Rodeo-Chediski Fire, below right) can create a combustion cloud 
that produces lightning, rain, and dangerous downbursts of winds up to 60 mph, sending 
embers in all directions. 
 
 Southwestern uplands are highly flammable. In 
late spring and early summer dry conditions, high 
winds, and heavy fuel accumulations combine 
with lightning and human-induced fire starts to 
create ideal conditions for large, severe fires in 
many southwestern ponderosa pine forests. 
 
Home Protection and the Wildland –Urban 
Interface (WUI) 
 
 Buildings ignite when wildland fire comes within a few feet of flammable building 
materials.3 Houses most often burn when grass, wood piles, wood chips, and other fuels in 
the yard catch fire, but wind-borne embers can also ignite buildings that are much farther 
from the fire front. 
 
 Homeowners can minimize fire risk by reducing 
hazardous fuels around and adjacent to their homes 
to create “defensible space.” In addition, minimizing 
the use of highly flammable building materials (such as 
wood roofs and siding) can reduce the threat posed by 
wind-borne embers. These simple steps can allow homes 
to survive even some extremely severe wildfires.4 
Creating defensible space involves 
developing a series of management zones in 
which different treatments are used.5 
 
 
 Fuel breaks can be efficient and cost effective in protecting communities from 
catastrophic wildfire. However, they are not a replacement for a strategic fuels treatment 
program because they address neither homeowner responsibilities for fire-safe yards and 
houses nor the need to restore southwestern ponderosa pine forests on a landscape scale.6 
They also can be overwhelmed by wind-driven fires that produce embers and spot fires. 
 
 Community protection plans must incorporate landscape considerations. Such factors as 
topography, prevailing winds, and fuel patterns can allow fire to travel extremely quickly. 
Fire protection plans for towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods must consider such factors 
to be effective. 
 
 Buildings and other structures are not the only values at risk. Many southwestern 
communities rely on surrounding forests for tourism, recreation, aesthetics, resource 
extraction, watershed protection, and other values. Protecting only developed areas, and not

forests, raises the possibility that fire-safe towns will be set in a landscape of burned forests 
and degraded ecological values for many decades to come.
