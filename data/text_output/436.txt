Abstract 
Understory plant communities were measured at five Grand Canyon National Park study sites 
and one Kaibab National Forest study site. Average species richness ranged from 6.4 to 19.5; 
weighted richness (Simpson's Index) ranged from 2.6 to 7. Dense, fire-excluded forest sites on the 
North Rim had the lowest richness. Cumulative species curves indicated that approximately 50% of 
species were captured within 10 sampling plots. Forbs and graminoids were the most common growth 
'forms at all sites. The proportion of native species ranged from 79% to 98%. Four plant farnilies­
Poaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Schrophulariaceae-predominated. Most grasses were in the C3 
("cool season") category. One invasive exotic grass, Bromus tectorum, was encountered in low 
frequencies but remains a concern for further spread with fire. Plant community ordination indicated 
that sites were segregated and two environmental variables, canopy cover and tree basal area, were 
significantly associated with community trends.

Introduction 
Understory vegetation-herbaceous plants and shrubs-provides the great majority of plant 
biodiversity in southwestern forests and is significant in primary productivity, habitat resources, fuel 
for fire, and soil stabilization. Forest plant communities have become simplified and reduced in 
productivity as a result of livestock grazing and establishment of dense forest stands. However, the 
..Grand Canyon study sites provide an opportunity to study plant communities in unharvested forests, 
including two sites (Powell Plateau and Rainbow Plateau) where surface fire regimes have continued 
after Euro-American settlement. This report is a brief presentation of herbaceous and shrub findings. 
Study Sites 
Study sites and sampling design are described in the preceding two sections of this document. 
In all tables and figures, sites are listed from lowest to highest elevation. Site codes are as follows: 
Kaibab National Forest (KF) and Grandview (GV) on the South Rim, and Powell Plateau (PP), Fire 
Point (FP), Rainbow Plateau (RP) and Swamp Ridge (SR) on the North Rim.

Plant Communities in Grand Canyon Forests 
Methods 
Sampling protocol for herbaceous and shrub vegetation was modified from the National Park 
Service Fire Monitoring protocol (NPS 1992) as described in the preceding section of this report. 
Herbaceous vegetation , for the purposes of this report, includes all vascular plants that are non-woody 
in nature. Shrubs are also included in this report, but fungi, lichen, and mosses were not included. 
The point line-intercept method was used to collect herbaceous and shrub data on all plots. 
Measurements were taken every 30 em along two 50 m transects laid out on the long sides of a 50 x 20 
m rectangular plot (referred to as "transects" or "line transects"). The data were then converted to a 
frequency basis, according to the total number of points intercepted by a particular species out of the 
total number of possible points on a transect. Presence/abscence of species was also recorded within 5 
m to either side of each transect, forming two 10 m wide belts on each plot ("belt transects"). Heights 
were recorded for the tallest living plant encountered at the transect point. 
Data were collected over the field season in 1997 (late April-mid July)for the South Rim and 
in 1998 for the North Rim. Fire Point data were collected from early May to early June . Powell 
Plateau data were collected in mid-late June.Rainbow Plateau data were collected from mid-late July. 
Swamp Ridge data was collected from late July-early August. Collections later in the season are more 
likely to miss some of the earlier-flowering annuals, and early collections will miss species that 
depend on monsoonal moisture for flowering. These factors should be taken into account when 
comparing the various results in the report. 
Data analysis included calculations of plant and substrate frequencies, species richness, 
Simpson's Index (richness weighted by frequency), and cumulative species curves. Community 
ordination (non-metric multidimensional scaling, NMOS) analyses were done to contrast plant 
communities and identify trends associated with environmental variables. 
The taxonomic authority used was the USDA Plants Database (http://plants.usda.gov) (USDA 
2000). In certain cases, Intermountain Flora (Cronquist et al. 1972, 1977, 1984, 1989, 1994, 1997) 
and Arizona Flora (Kearney and Peebles 1960) were also used. 
Results and Discussion 
.." 
Multiple intercepts. The point line-intercepts had a total of 75,032 measurement points (226 
plots X 332 points per plot). Multiple plant intercepts often occurred at points along the transects, e.g., 
plant #1 above plant #2 above substrate. The most common category was substrate alone, which 
included litter, duff, soil, rock, wood, bole and scat. The second most common category was a plant 
growing over a substrate, counted as 2 intercepts at one point. MUltiple intercepts occurred ¥ follows: 
three intercepts at one point (substrate + 2 plants) occurred 4330 times. Four intercepts (substrate + 3 
plants) occurred 493 times. Five intercepts (substrate + 4 plants) occurred 48 times. Six intercepts 
(substrate + 5 plants) occurred 4 times. 
Plant/substrate cover. Litter (primarily needles, leaves and cones from tree and shrub 
species) and plants were the most frequent ground covers recorded along herbaceous transects (Figure 
1). The two North Rim sites with continued-fire regimes (PP and RP) had the greatest plant cover, 
over 40%. The South Rim sites (KF and GV) both had approximately 30% cover, despite the absence 
of livestock grazing on the National Park side since the late 1930' s. The fire-excluded North Rim sites 
(FP and SR - see previous chapters for explanation of the FP fire regime) had the least plant cover. 
Litter covered over 70% of the surface at FP.

Species richness. Three categories of species richness (number of species) were measured: 
line transect only, belt transect only and line transect plus belt transect (Table 1). Between 21 and 37 
additional species that were not on line transects were recorded on belt transects for each site (see 
Table 20 for a list of these species). The line transects were efficient in the field and provided useful 
cover and substrate data, but the finding that the belt transects were highly effective for finding 
additional species indicates that line transects alone were ineffective for plant community 
measurements. Especially where rare plants or species richness are of interest, other sampling 
methods should supplement the line transects. In another northern Arizona study site, modified­
Whittaker plots (nested quadrats up to 20 X 50 m) captured even more species than a line + belt 
transect methodology (LE. Korb, Northern Arizona University, personal communication, 2000). 
The highest species richness occurred at Grandview, but this site also had the most plots inventoried 
(67) and the largest area (603 ha). Richness was also calculated on a per-plot basis (Table 2).  
Average richness per plot ranged from 6.4 species at Swamp Ridge up to 19.5 species at Grandview;  
extremes ranged from 1 species at Swamp Ridge to 31 at Rainbow Plateau. Average species richness  
correlates little with the minimum and maximum species richness. Four of the sites (KF, GV, PP, and  
RP) had a minimum species richness on a per plot basis of 9 or 10. Maximum species richness on a  
per plot basis was highest at Rainbow Plateau (31) and Grandview (30) and lowest at Swamp Ridge  
(17) and Fire Point (19) . 
Species richness at the per-site and per-plot scale was relatively closely related: the per-plot  
average richness (Table 2) ranged from 11% to 15% of the per-site species total, except at SR (8%).  
Simpson's Index. Simpson's index (S1) is a widely used dominance measure of diversity. It  
emphasizes or gives weight to the most abundant or common species, and is not therefore a direct  
measure of species richness. Using the line transect methodology, abundance is considered to be  
equivalent to the frequency of encountering a given species along an herbaceous transect. Note that  
frequency does not represent a percentage of the whole plant community, because individual plants  
may be large enough to cross more than one line-transect intercept.  
The average Simpson's index ranged from a low of 2.58 at Swamp Ridge to a high of 6.97 at 
Grandview (Table 2). The minimum per-plot SI was 1.0 at Swamp Ridge and the maximum was 14.7 
at Powell Plateau. The SI weighting indicated differences between sites FP and SR. Both had 
, relatively low per-plot and total species richness, but the average SI value at FP was nearly twice that 
at SR, reflecting the higher abundance of plants at FP. 
Cumulative species curves. Species-area curves are used to determine the minimal sampling 
area that will capture the occurrence of all species at a site. The resulting graph of species richness on 
the y-axis and sampling area on the x-axis will eventually level off if the vegetation is sampled from a 
homogenous area (Kent & Coker 1992). In the present study, sampling plots were located on a 300 m 
grid, so each plot represented 9 ha but sampled only a small fraction of that area. Rather than develop 
a species-area relationship, therefore, we plotted the number of species per plot against the number of 
plots sampled (Figure 2). The point at which the curves level off indicates the number of plots 
corresponding to a complete census of species at the site. All sites captured 50% or more of the total 
species within about 10 plots. However, perhaps because of the proximity of the sampling sites to the 
canyon rims, a leveling off did not occur on any of the curves when the belt transect was included in 
the analysis. When the line transect alone was graphed, a leveling off appeared to Occur around 20 
plots at Rainbow and Powell Plateaus and at Swamp Ridge. At GV and RP, cumulative species curves 
were developed by following both north-south and east-west patterns along the sampling grids. These 
curves did not differ from curves developed from randomly chosen plots , indicating that unusually 
diverse plant communities were not spatially segregated within the sites.

Plant Communities in Grand Canyon Forests 
Growth habit. Growth forms (shrub, forb, graminoid) provide a measure of structural 
diversity and the suitability of a community as habitat for insects , birds, mammals and other wildlife. 
Shrubs and subshrubs provide fruits and browse for many species of wildlife, and they occur in low 
numbers throughout much of the ponderosa pine forest in the Southwest. Forbs, as defined in this 
study, are all herbaceous flowering plants other than graminoids, the grasses and grass-like plants 
(sedges and rushes). Forbs provide forage for herbivores, nectar for pollinating species of insects and 
birds, seeds for granivorous birds and mammals and cover for many animal species. Graminoids 
provide forage for ungulates and food for some insect species. Grasses are also an important source of 
fuel for fire. 
The most common growth forms by far along the herbaceous transects were forbs and 
graminoids (Figure 3). Graminoids were more frequent than forbs at all sites except Powell Plateau. 
Shrubs and subshrubs were minor contributors to the overall percentage of plant species on herbaceous 
transects, with the highest numbers at Powell Plateau. 
Nativity. All plants were categorized based upon their origin as native, introduced, or 
unknown-plants which either were identifiable only to the genus level or for which there is 
uncertainty in the literature as to their origin. Unknown species were a small fraction of the plants 
encountered « 1% to 4%) and were excluded from the analyses that describe percent native species 
(Table 3). Most of the unknown species were Cirsium sp., Amaranthus sp., Artemisia sp.,and 
Descurainia sp. Non-native species and their frequencies are listed in Table 21. 
Growth habit frequencies of native species (Figure 4) were similar to overall growth habit 
frequencies described above (Figure 3). However, native forbs were more abundant than native 
grasses at both Powell Plateau and Fire Point. The percentage of native species was lowest at Fire 
Point (78.8%) . At all other sites, it ranged from 90.7 at Grandview to 98.4% (Swamp Ridge) (Table 
4). Swamp Ridge had the lowest Simpson's index of diversity, but had the highest percentage of 
native species. Fire Point ranked 5th for diversity, and had a very high percentage of introduced 
species (21.2%). 
Height. Plant heights can be a factor in suitability of wildlife habitat and in fire behavior.  
Height data should be interpreted with caution because heights differ throughout the season due to  
..phenological and environmental factors affecting growth of plants, such as precipitation and  
"  herbivory . The minimum height entered into the database was 0.1 m, so this is the minimum height at 
all sites (Table 5). The maximum height was 8 m at Grandview for Amelanchier utahensis. The 
methodology has since been modified so that only species less than 1.37 m (breast height) are 
recorded. Species taller than 1.37 m were dropped from the analyses The mean height was lowest at 
Fire Point (0.12 m) and highest at Powell Plateau (0.20 m). 
<­
Plant families. The majority of species along herbaceous transects fell into 7 families (Table 
6): Poaceae (grasses), Asteraceae (composites), Fabaceae (legumes), Cyperaceae (sedges), 
Scrophulariaceae (snapdragons), Polygonaceae (buckwheats) and Dennstaedtiaceae (bracken ferns). 
Over 20% of intercepts along herbaceous transects at the South Rim sites (Kaibab National Forest, 
Grandview) are from the grass family. The grass family is well represented at Rainbow Plateau on the 
North Rim (19.5%), but legumes dominate the understory at Powell Plateau and Fire Point. The sedges 
dominate at Swamp Ridge (8.1%). 
Tables 7 through 10 show detailed species composition within four families (Poaceae,  
Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Scrophulariaceae), discussed below.

Plant Communities in Grand Canyon Forests 
Graminoids. Native graminoids (grasses, sedges, and rushes) made up a larger percentage of 
the plant community than introduced graminoids at all Grand Canyon sites (Table 7), although the 
non-native Poa pratensis (Kentucky bluegrass) was relatively common at Fire Point. The most 
common native species were Poa fendleriana (rnuttongrass), Elymus elymoides ssp. elymoides 
(squirreltail), Bromus ciliatus (fringed brome), and Carex occidentalis (western sedge). Introduced 
graminoids were relatively uncommon except for Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) at the South Rim 
(Grandview) and Poa pratensis (Kentucky bluegrass) at the North Rim (Fire Point, Rainbow Plateau). 
Although the frequency of Bromus tectorum was low at study sites where it occurred, the species is of 
concern because cheatgrass is a highly invasive exotic that has adapted well to frequent fire in the 
Pacific Northwest and Great Basin regions. It is also known to change fire regimes in areas of the 
western United States (Mosley et al. 1999). 
Carex occidentalis was almost 10 times as frequent as other graminoids at one North Rim site, 
Swamp Ridge. Because of the difficulty in determining Carex species vegetatively, the sites may 
contain other Carex species that we failed to distinguish. 
A characteristic of graminoids that factors into their abundance and productivity is their 
photosynthetic pathway. Studies by Hatch and Slack (1966), Downton (1970), and Black (1971) 
revealed that a 4-carbon pathway (C4) allows plants to produce more biomass especially in warm, dry, 
sunny areas. The presence of C4 grasses at a site may be indicative of conditions previously more 
open, warmer, and/or drier (Kerns 1999). Other species having only a 3-carbon photosynthetic 
pathway (C3) thrive in cool, moist, shady areas (Waller and Lewis 1979). Grasses with C3 pathways 
. dominated the graminoid community at both the South Rim and North Rim sites (Table 7). It appears 
that C3 graminoids thrive in the heavily-shaded understory of most present-day ponderosa pine forests. 
Very few C4 graminoids were recorded and most of these occurred at the lower elevation, hotter and 
drier sites at the South Rim (Kaibab National Forest, Grandview). At the cooler, wetter North Rim 
sites, only 2 species of C4 grasses tMuhlenbergia repens, Blepharoneuron tricholepis) were recorded, 
and no grasses with this pathway were recorded on the line transects at Fire Point or Swamp Ridge. 
Some historic data on grass composition exist from the park, although the specific locations of 
the studies are not known. Rasmussen (1941) observed that Muhlenbergia montana (mountain 
muhly), Blepharoneuron tricholepis (pine-dropseed) and Sitanion hystrix (squirreltail, synonymous 
with Elymus elymoides), were common on the Kaibab Plateau (North Rim) in climax ponderosa pine 
forests at the time of his writing. Muhlenbergia montana was not captured by transects on any North 
Rim site, and Blepharoneuron tricholepis was recorded only at Rainbow Plateau. On the belt 
transects, there were three occurrences of B. tricholepis at Powell Plateau and eight occurrences at 
Rainbow Plateau. This species was not recorded at Fire Point or Swamp Ridge. There was only one 
occurrence of Muhlenbergia montana recorded on the belt transects at the North Rim (Rainbow 
Plateau). Merkle (1962) listed the most common grasses at the North Rim (specific study-area 
uncertain) as Poafendleriana at 66% ofthe cover, Muhlenbergia montana (43%), Sitanion hystrix or 
Elymus elymoides (22%) and Blepharoneuron tricholepis (1%). 
. 
Composites. Composites provide an important nectar source for flies, bees and butterflies. 
Because their seeds are often wind-dispersed, and because individual.plants may produce copious 
amounts of seed, many species are early colonizers after disturbance, especially if bale mineral soil is 
available. Solidago, Erigeron and Cirsium were the most common genera of this family over all sites 
(Table 8). Many of these genera are difficult to determine vegetatively to species; thus they were 
often not identifiable to the species level. Solidago (goldenrod) was probably the most common genus 
at all sites. However, it did not occur on any of the transects at Fire Point. Gutierrezia sarothrae 
(snakeweed) was present only on the South Rim, and was more common in the Kaibab National 
Forest. Achillea millefolium var. occidentalis (western yarrow) was the most common species on the 
70  

Plant Communities in Grand Canyon Forests 
North Rim sites. It did not occur on the transects at the South Rim at either Grandview or the Kaibab 
National Forest. Artemisia tridentata (big sagebrush) was present on transects at Grandview and on 
Powell Plateau. 
Merkle (1962) reported the most common composites on the South Rim to be Solidago 
sparsiflora (35% of plant cover), Chrysothamnus depressus (30%), Artemisia pacifica (25%), 
Artemisia carruthii (20%), Cirsium wheeleri (15%), Artemisia tridentata (10%) and Antennaria 
parvifolia (10%). On the North Rim, the most common composites he found were Heterotheca villosa 
(25%), Antennaria parvifolia (17%), Artemisia carruthii (12%), Achillea millefolium (9%), Cirsium 
wheeleri (9%), Solidago sparsiflora (6%) and Vigiuera (=Heliomeris) multiflora (6%). Rasmussen 
(1941) listed some of the more common composites on the Kaibab Plateau as Erigeron dive rgens , 
Solidago sp., Artemisia ludoviciana, and Antennaria sp. Neither author clearly described the locations 
of their study sites so comparisons between their studies and the present study are difficult. 
Legumes. Legumes are often among the first species to appear aboveground (either 
germinating from the soil seed bank or sprouting vegetatively) at a site following disturbance and 
often begin to decrease as a component of the plant community over time (Arianoutsou and Thanos 
1996, Martinez-Sanchez et at. 1999); however, they may remain a major component of the community 
in some areas (Kazanis and Arianoutsou 1996). Legumes may also increase on sites that are regularly 
burned as opposed to those sites that receive a single burning treatment (Hendricks and Boring 1999). 
They are also noted for their nitrogen-fixing ability that tends to increase available nitrogen in soils 
(Hainds et at. 1999, Hendricks and Boring 1999). Other plants have been found to positively respond 
to this surplus of nitrogen. Legumes are also important nectar and seed sources. 
Distinct patterns are difficult to determine because of the variety of species found at each site 
although some trends are apparent. Lupinus argenteus/hillii (silver lupine) was by far the most 
common legume at the South Rim and appears to be more common there than at the North Rim Sites 
(Table 9). The most legume species were found at Grandview (14 species). White clover (Trifolium 
repens), a non-native, was found only at the South Rim sites. Aspen peavine (Lathyrus lanszwertii 
var. leucanthus) was abundant only at two sites, Powell and Rainbow Plateau. The abundance of 
legumes at Swamp Ridge was extremely low when compared to other sites. Only one species of 
legume (Lotus utahensisi occurred on the Swamp Ridge transects. Rasmussen (1941) mentioned that 
by the time of his publication, certain legumes had entirely disappeared from the Kaibab plateau due to 
severe overgrazing by domestic livestock and/or wild deer populations in the late 1800's and early 
..-
1900's. He listed the most common legumes from the climax ponderosa pine forests on the Kaibab 
Plateau as Lupinus barbiger (bearded or silky lupine), Lotus wrightii (Wright's deervetch), and 
Astragalus spp. Merkle (1962) listed the most common legume species from the North Rim as 
Lupinus hillii (55% of plant cover) and Lotus utahensis (18%). On the South Rim, the most common 
legumes he encountered were Lupinus hillii (8%) and Lotus wrightii (35%) . 
Snapdragon Family. Because of their longevity in the soil seed bank and their prolific seed 
production, members of the Scrophulariaceae occur often on recently disturbed sites (Kitchen and 
Meyer 1992, Davis et at. 1995, Nylehn and Totland 1999). Thus they are valuable as early colonizers 
following disturbance or restoration treatments. Many members of this family are also significant 
sources of nectar for insects and hummingbirds. Collinsia parviflora (blue-eyed Mary), an annual, 
was the most numerous species in this family at all sites on the North and South Rims, with the 
exception of Swamp Ridge (Table to). 'Various species of Penstemon (particularly P. barbatus and P. 
linarioidesi were also common at all sites except for Swamp Ridge. 
Historic frequencies of species in this family are unknown. Rasmussen (1941) mentioned 
Castilleja as a common genus on the Kaibab Plateau. Merkle (1962) described Penstemon 
71 

, Plant Communities in Grand Canyon Forests 
pachyphyllus as the only common species of this family on the South Rim in the Pinus ponderosa­
Artemisia tridentata forest. This species comprised 13% of the plant cover. 
Cacti. Cacti were recorded on belt transects but were not found on any of the line transects . . 
Of the 13 total occurrences of cacti, 12 were at Grandview and I was at Powell Plateau . At 
Grandview, the only species that were found included (4 hits), Escobaria (=Coryphantha) vivipara 
var. arizonica (II hits) and Opuntia sp. (I hit). The only species found on the belt transects at Powell 
Plateau was Escobaria (=Coryphantha) vivipara var. arizonica. 
Ferns. Ferns were uncommon in our survey of the ponderosa pine forest of the Grand 
Canyon. Only one species, Pteridium aquilinum (bracken fern) was recorded on either the line or belt 
transects , and only at Swamp Ridge. This species was encountered at 1.4% of the line transect points. 
Plant Communities. The NMDS ordination based on species abundance (Figure 5) indicated 
that Swamp Ridge and Northwest ill (a burned area immediately north of the SR site) were similar to 
each other in species abundance and composition, yet had distinctly separate communities. The 
Grandview and Kaibab National Forest plant communities are also similar to each other. The Powell 
and Rainbow Plateau community data points intermingled, indicating a community in which the two 
sites are indistinguishable from each other. Fire Point did not associate well with any of the other 
communities. Three vectors were fitted to the data: trees per ha (TPH), average canopy cover, and 
basal area (m2/ha). Canopy cover and basal area were highly significant «0.0001), indicating that 
these two variables were among those factors responsible for determining the composition of the plant 
community. Tree density was not significant. Because data were collected over two years, it is 
possible that the separation of communities is due to climatic factors rather than species composition. 
Indicator species for each site are listed in Table II. These species were most responsible for 
the clumping patterns observed for each community. Several species were found on all plot transects 
at each particular site. These species are listed in Table 12 and are all grasses or sedges . Species found 
at all sites (but not necessarily on all plots at each site) include Collinsia parviflora, Elymus elymoides, 
Eriogonum racemosum, Mahonia repens, and Poafendleriana. In addition, there were a large number 
of species observed only on the plots at one particular site. These species are listed in Table 13. 
These species are also important in determining the clumping of plant communities, as indicated by 
the NMDS ordination. 
Merkle (1962) described the plant communities in ponderosa pine forests of the North and  
South Rims. He described Gambel oak as a shrub on the South Rim, and mentioned that it was  
browsed heavily and killed in some cases. Few non-native species were recorded by Merkle in the  
ponderosa pine communities, perhaps due to time of collection, area covered, methodology or very  
small frequencies of these species . Descriptions of the most comon grasses and shrubs found by  
Merkle are listed above under the appropriate sections.  
Rare Species. It is important to consider the impacts of restoration efforts on rare species 
when design ing management plans. During the course of the monitoring at the Grand Canyon, very 
few rare plant species were encountered at the sites, most likely due to the scattered distribution of 
these species and the distance between plots (300 m between plots). Rare species that were observed 
include: Paronychia sessiliflora (creeping nailwort), Chrysothamnus depressus (longflower 
rabbitbrush), and Draba asprella var. kaibabensis (Kaibab whitiowgrass). Some rare species on the 
plots may have been overlooked due to time constraints, identification errors, or confusion with 
similar species. Rare species that are known to occur in the areas of our monitoring sites are noted in 
Table 14 (adapted from Brian 2000).

Trees. Tree species (Table 15) were excluded from all understory analyses. However, all 
tree species are listed in the comprehensive Grand Canyon species list (Appendix I). Trees were 
recorded only where they contacted an herbaceous transect intercept and were <1.37 m in height. 
Across sites, Quercus gambellii and Robinia neomexicana occurred at the highest frequencies. The 
most abundant trees at Swamp Ridge (Abies concolor, Populus tremuloides) were infrequent or did 
not occur at the other sites. 
Table 16 lists the occurrence of tree species on belt transects at all sites. Most of these species 
were captured by the point line-intercept transects with the exception of Robinia neomexicana at the 
Kaibab National Forest, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Pinus edulis at Grandview, Juniperus osteosperma 
(Powell Plateau), Abies concolor (Fire Point) , Pinus edulis and Populus tremuloides (Rainbow 
Plateau) and Prunus virginiana (Swamp Ridge). Sambucus nigra ssp. cerulea (blue elderberry) was 
collected in the vicinity of the study area at Grandview, but was never captured by a monitoring plot. 
Shrubs and subshrubs. In favorable conditions, some subshrubs can grow to be as tall as 
shrubs but are most often shortert-c.l m in height) and less robust. Subshrubs are usually woody at the 
base but sometimes are recorded as herbaceous plants. Species that were designated as subshrubs 
include Mahonia repens (Oregon grape), Gutierrezia sarothrae (snakeweed), Chrysothamnus 
depressus (longflower rabbitbrush), Paxistima myrsinites (mountain lover), Lonicera arizonica 
(Arizona honeysuckle), and Apocynum androsaemifolium (spreading dogbane). Species categorized 
as shrubs include Amelanchier utahensis (Utah serviceberry), Arctostaphylos pungens (pointleaf 
manzanita), Artemisia tridentata (big sagebrush), Ceanothus fendleri (buckbrush), Ericameria 
nauseosa ssp. nauseosa (rabbitbrush), Fallugia paradoxa (Apache plume), Juniperus communis 
(common juniper), Philadelphus microphyllus (littleleaf mockorange), Purshia mexicana (Mexican 
cliffrose), Quercus turbinella (turbinella oak), Ribes cereum (wax currant), Ribes leptanthum (trumpet 
gooseberry), Rosa woodsii var. ultramontana (=R. arizonicai (Woods' rose), Rubus sp. (blackberry), 
Symphoricarpos oreophilus (whortleleaf snowberry), Symphoricarpos oreophilus var. utahensis, and 
Tetradymia sp. (horsebrush). 
Shrub and subshrub frequencies at each site were much lower than forb and graminoid 
frequencies (Figure 3). At the South Rim sites (Kaibab National Forest, Grandview), shrubs and 
subshrubs were relatively similar in abundance. At the North Rim sites, shrubs were more frequent 
than subshrubs only at Powell Plateau. Mahonia repens was the most frequent subshrub recorded 
"  along herbaceous transects. Shrubs were relatively small with few over 3.6 m in height. Subshrubs 
were smaller and did not exceed 0.4 m in height. The number of shrubs, based on tree seedling or 
regeneration plots was limited to only two species (Table 17): Amelanchier utahensis (Utah 
serviceberry) at Grandview, and Sorbus dumosa (Arizona mountain ash) at Swamp Ridge. 
The number of belt transects containing shrubs at each site is listed in Table 18. Merkle 
(1962) listed the most common species at the South Rim as Chrysothamnus depressus (30% of plant 
cover), Berberis (=Mahonia) repens (20%), Cowania (=Purshia) mexicana (15%) and Artemisia 
tridentata (10%). At the North Rim, Berberis (=Mahonia) repens was most common (15%), followed 
by Rosa woodsii var. ultramontana (= R. arizonica)(8%), Ceanothus fendleri (7%) and 
Chrysothamnus depressus (7%) . Merkle stated that oak and cliffrose had been browsed in the 
-ponderosa-sagebrush community at the Grand Canyon and that shrubs were scarce in inc ponderosa 
pine-grassland community (1962) . Rasmussen (1941) detailed a decline of shrubs at the Kaibab 
Plateau, due primarily to a mule deer population eruption in the 1920's which diminished populations 
of Ceanothus fendleri, Symphoricarpos sp. and Rubus sp. The most common shrub in i~ .: ponderosa 
pine forests on the Kaibab Plateau in the late 1930's was Berberis (=Mahonia) repens. .srctostapkylos

nigra ssp. cerulea (blue elderberry), Ribes cereum var. pedicel/are (whiskey currant) and Holodiscus 
discolor (=Seriotheca glabrescens) (shrubby cream bush) were also common. 
Decline of shrubs in the ponderosa forests of northern Arizona may also be attributable to fire 
exclusion; however, data are scant. Ceanothus fendleri sprouting has been observed following 
prescribed burning in burned plots but not in unburned plots (David Huffman, personal 
communication, Northern Arizona University, 2000), and higher numbers of seedlings have been 
reported from more intensely burned plots (Vose and White 1987). General resprouting after fire has 
also been reported for this species (Pearson et at. 1972, Ffolliott et at. 1977). In addition , C fendleri 
I
seeds have been shown to require heat scarification for germination (Story 1974). 
.
; 
Moss, lichen, fungi and cryptogamic soil. Moss , lichen and fungi were excluded from all 
understory analy ses (Table 19). It is important to note that these groups were not consistently 
recorded across sites and years. Fungi are probably underrepresented because of sampling variation 
among field technicians. Of the data that were recorded, lichen and moss were the most frequent at 
both the South Rim and North Rim sites. Cryptogamic soils were observed only at Grandview. 
Because all these groups are good indicators of disturbance, changes in methodology and field 
identification training for technicians may be warranted. 
Belt transects. Table 20 lists species that were recorded on belt transects, but not on point 
line-intercept transects . Note that unidentified species on the belts may actually have been identified 
to species on the line transects and thus may be responsible for discrepancies (for example calling a 
species PoLygonum sp. on the line because the plant may only be a seedling and not identifiable to 
I 
species and then calling it PoLygonum douglasii on the belt because it is identifiable to species ­
I 
resulting in two species in the analysis). Some of the most common species in the ponderosa pine 
forest were not detected by the line transects (such as Muhlenbergia montana at Rainbow Plateau, 
Lotus wrightii at Swamp Ridge, Potentilla hippiana at Kaibab National Forest and Tragopogon dubius 
and Bouteloua gracilis at Powell Plateau). This analysis demonstrates the value of the belt transects 
for capturing additional species . 
Collections and species list. A species list was compiled for all of the plant species that  
were recorded on or near sites (Appendix I). Not all of these species were recorded on plots and some  
additional species from the nearby area were included as well. All plant collections that were archived  
in an herbarium are listed in Appendix II. The table lists the collection numbers of all plant specimens  
and to which herbarium they were donated.
