New ERI Series: Topics on
Restoration and Resiliency
The Ecological Restoration Institute developed a
new series called Topics in Restoration and
Resiliency to answer our most frequently asked
questions. Topics range from wildland ﬁre basics
to forest thinning treatment effects and ﬁre scar
and tree dating methods. Our goal is to
provide land managers and the public with a
better understanding of ERI science and the
implications for public land management. This
series is growing, so check our e-library often for
new releases!
