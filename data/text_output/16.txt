Abstract
In the 100 years following the arrival of Euro-Ameri-
can settlers in northern Arizona, Pinus ponderosa
(ponderosa pine) forests changed from open, low-den-
sity stands to closed, high-density stands. The in-
crease in tree density has been detrimental to the
vigor of old-growth trees that established before set-
tlement (presettlement trees). In this study, we exam-
ined whether the vigor of presettlement trees could be
improved by restoring the original stand structure by
thinning the ponderosa pines that established after
settlement (postsettlement trees). The restoration
treatment caused the following changes in the preset-
tlement trees and their environment in the first year
following thinning: an increase in volumetric soil wa-
ter content between May and August, an increase in
predawn xylem water potential in July and August, a
decrease in midday xylem water potential in June and
August, an increase in net photosynthetic rate in Au-
gust, an increase in foliar nitrogen concentration in
July and August, and an increase in bud and needle
size. The results show that the thinning restoration
treatment improved the condition of presettlement
ponderosa pines by increasing canopy growth and the
uptake of water, nitrogen, and carbon.
Introduction
B
efore Euro-American settlement in the southwest-
ern United States, Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa pine)
forests were characterized by a dense grass understory
and highly flammable leaf litter that carried low-inten-
sity ground fires every 2–20 years (Cooper 1960; Weaver
1974; Dieterich 1980; Arno 1988; Swetnam & Baisan
1996). These fires maintained relatively open forests
and savannas (Pearson 1950; Cooper 1960; Covington &
Moore 1994; Swetnam & Baisan 1996). Following settle-
ment by non-indigenous peoples, however, pines in-
vaded meadows and increased in density in forested ar-
eas because of fire suppression, a reduction of grass
cover caused by livestock overgrazing, and a good
seed-production year in 1918 followed by a favorable,
warm, wet climate for seedling establishment (Cooper
1960; Dieterich 1980; Madany & West 1983; Covington
& Moore 1994; Savage et al. 1996; Swetnam & Baisan
1996). This increase in tree density in southwestern
ponderosa pine forests has caused unhealthy character-
istics such as a decrease in the growth rate and an in-
crease in the mortality of old-growth trees (Sutherland
1983; Biondi 1996), an increase in ponderosa pine water
stress (Kolb et al. 1998), a decease in key resistance
mechanisms of ponderosa pine against insects (Kolb et
al. 1998), a stagnation of nutrient cycling rates (Coving-
ton & Sackett 1992; Kaye & Hart 1998), a decrease in the
growth and diversity of herbaceous plants (Covington
& Moore 1994; Covington et al. 1997; Dahms & Geils
1997), ecosystem simplification because of the domi-
nance of ponderosa pine (Covington & Moore 1994;
Covington et al. 1997), and an increase in fire severity
and size (Covington & Moore 1994).
There is presently much interest in improving forest
health by restoring the stand structure and disturbance
regime that was present before Euro-American settle-
ment in southwestern ponderosa pine forests. We have
initiated such a restoration project at the G. A. Pearson
Natural Area in northern Arizona, which contains a
relict old-growth stand of ponderosa pine in which the
effects of restoration treatments on a suite of ecosystem
characteristics are being examined (Covington et al.
1997; Kaye & Hart 1998; Feeney et al. 1998). Under-
standing the response of presettlement trees to restora-
tion treatments is an important component of this
project because of their great scarcity and value. The
term “presettlement” is used to refer to the old-growth
ponderosa pines that established in northern Arizona
before 1876 (the approximate date of settlement by
Euro-Americans), and “postsettlement” is used to refer
to ponderosa pines that established in northern Arizona
after 1876. Because the presettlement trees are old
(.121 years) and have been suppressed by competition
from the postsettlement trees for decades (Sutherland

1983), it is unknown whether they are responsive to res-
toration treatments.
This paper addresses whether restoration of pre-
Euro-American stand structure by thinning can reverse
the decline in vigor of the presettlement ponderosa
pines. Tree vigor was measured by canopy growth and
the uptake of essential resources (carbon, nitrogen,
phosphorus, and water).
Methods
Study Area
The study area is in a 4.7-ha portion of the G. A. Pear-
son Natural Area in the Fort Valley Experimental For-
est, Coconino National Forest. The site is located 14.5
km northwest of Flagstaff, Arizona, U.S.A. (11184493099
W, 3581691199 N). At an elevation of 2195–2255 m, the to-
pography of the site is level or very gently rolling, hav-
ing slopes of 0–5% with a south-southwest aspect
(Avery et al. 1976; White 1985; Covington et al. 1997).
The site has a relatively homogeneous climate, topogra-
phy, geology, soil parent material, soil type, biota, and
disturbance history (Avery et al. 1976; White 1985).
The study site has a cold and subhumid temperature
with a pronounced drought in May and June (Schubert
1974). Scattered late-summer afternoon thundershow-
ers starting in late June or July result in highly variable
annual precipitation. Precipitation in August, the wet-
test month, averages 82 mm. From 1909 to 1990, the av-
erage annual precipitation was 564 mm, the summer
maximum air temperature was 36.18C, the winter mini-
mum air temperature was 238.38C, and the mean an-
nual temperature was 6.08C (National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration 1990). Snow can accumulate
from November through March and accounts for about
half of the annual precipitation (Schubert 1974). The
frost-free growing season has averaged 94 days (Avery
et al. 1976).
The soil parent material at the study site is derived
from late-Tertiary basalt lava flows and volcanic cin-
ders. The soil is classified as a Brolliar stony clay-loam,
a fine, smectitic, Typic Argiboroll (Miller et al. 1995).
Trees at the study site are a naturally seeded, virgin
(i.e., never logged) stand of the southwestern variety of
ponderosa pine (var. scopulorum), also recognized as
type 237 by the Society of American Foresters (Eyre
1980). Typical of the Southwest, the stand structure at
the study site is currently uneven-aged with even-aged
postsettlement groups, varying in size from a few trees
to several hectares (Pearson 1950; Cooper 1960; Schu-
bert 1974), and uneven-aged presettlement groups (White
1985). The site index of the study area is 24.2–25.9 m per
100 years (Avery et al. 1976). The oldest pine in the Nat-
ural Area is greater than 600 years (Biondi et al. 1994).
Covington et al. (1997) described the ponderosa pine
stand at the study site as being dominated by pole-sized
trees (10–37 cm diameter at breast height [dbh], 74–116
years old) with scattered groups of presettlement trees
(37–105 cm dbh, 121–600 years old), dense thickets of
sapling-sized trees (,10 cm dbh, 57–73 years old), a few
scattered tree seedlings, and a few bunchgrass open-
ings. Understory vegetation is comprised mainly of Fes-
tuca arizonica (Arizona fescue), Muhlenbergia montana
(mountain muhly), Sitanion hystrix (squirreltail), several
forbs, and Ceanothus fendleri (Fendler buckbrush). A re-
construction of stand composition using dendrochrono-
logical techniques showed that tree density at the study
site has increased from about 59 trees/ha in 1876 to
about 3095 trees/ha in 1992 (Covington et al. 1997).
Livestock grazing occurred on the site from 1876 to
about 1920 (U.S. Forest Service, unpublished data).
Fires have not occurred in the area since 1876; before
that, low-intensity ground fires in the general area of
the study site occurred at an average interval of about 2
years (Dieterich 1980).
Restoration Treatment
In the fall of 1993, 2.76 ha of the study area was thinned
and 1.52 ha was left unthinned to serve as a control (Fig.
1). The thinning treatment removed most postsettle-
ment trees to emulate the more open stand conditions
typical before Euro-American settlement (Figs. 2 & 3).
Presettlement forest reference conditions were estab-
lished by stand reconstruction (Covington & Moore
1994; Covington et al. 1997). Tree ages were determined
by counting and cross-dating increment cores (Stokes &
Smiley 1968) from all presettlement trees and a 5% sub-
sample of all postsettlement trees. In the thinned block,
all presettlement trees were retained, as were postsettle-
ment trees 40.6 cm dbh or larger. Smaller-diameter
postsettlement trees that were near stumps, snags, and
downed presettlement logs were also retained to emu-
late the clumped pattern characteristic of presettlement
forests. Tree density in the thinned block was reduced
from an average of 2647 trees/ha to 151 trees/ha; tree
density in the unthinned control block remained at 4585
trees/ha.
Pretreatment Comparisons
Because average tree density differed between the con-
trol and thinned blocks prior to treatment, several pre-
treatment conditions were compared between blocks to
assess their degree of similarity prior to thinning (Table
1). Three sets of variables were used for the pretreat-
ment comparisons. First, mineral soil sampled before
thinning in 1993 was analyzed for organic matter con-
tent (OM), total nitrogen concentration [NT], and total

phosphorus concentration ([PT]). Second, xylem water
potential (CL) of 1-year-old needles from the lower
crown was compared among nine randomly selected
presettlement trees in the control block and 15 ran-
domly selected presettlement trees in the thinned block
in the summer of 1993. Third, dbh, 1989–1993 stem
basal area increment at breast height (BAI), age, and
three measures of competition were compared among
10 randomly selected presettlement trees in each of the
control and thinned blocks; these same 20 trees were
used for the posttreatment growth and physiological
measurements in 1994. Random selections of trees were
limited to presettlement trees with little crown dieback,
similar dbh, and a similar amount of pretreatment com-
petition.
Pretreatment competition on each presettlement tree
was measured by a diameter-distance competition in-
dex (CI) based on the sum of the ratios of the dbh of
Figure 1. Canopy maps of the study area within the G. A. 
Pearson Natural Area, Arizona, based on stand reconstruction 
(Covington et al. 1997): the reconstructed 1876 forest struc-
ture, pretreatment structure (1992, prior to the thinning treat-
ment), and posttreatment structure (1993, after the thinning 
treatment). Black areas represent the canopies of ponderosa 
pine trees.

western ponderosa pine forests since Euro-American settle-
ment, as shown by this view of G. A. Pearson National Area, 
Arizona, in 1992 (photography by the Ecological Restoration 
Program, Northern Arizona University).
Figure 3. This view in 1997 from the same location as in Fig-
ure 2 shows the effects of a thinning treatment that restored 
the stand to a tree density and structure similar to that docu-
mented for presettlement forests (photography by the Ecolog-
ical Restoration Program, Northern Arizona University).

each subject presettlement tree and its neighboring
trees, weighted by the distances between the subject
and neighboring trees (formula 1 in Lorimer 1983).
Neighboring trees were used in the CI if they occurred
within a circle with a radius of 40 times the dbh of the
subject tree (Sutherland et al. 1991). The three CIs calcu-
lated for each presettlement tree were CIPRE, which
measures competition from other presettlement trees
only; CIPOST, which measures competition from post-
settlement trees only; and CITOTAL, which measures
competition from both presettlement and postsettle-
ment trees.
Predawn CL for the pretreatment comparisons was
measured weekly during the 1993 growing season on
1-year-old needles from one lower canopy twig for each
tree. The needles were collected with a pole pruner
within about 2 hours before dawn. A plastic bag con-
taining a slightly moist paper towel was used to store
about 12 needles for each study tree. The bags of nee-
dles were kept in the dark in an insulated box at about
48C for less than 4 hours before measurement. CL was
measured with a pressure chamber (Model 1000, Plant
Moisture Systems, PMS Instrument Co., Corvallis, Ore-
gon, U.S.A.) by conventional techniques (Ritchie &
Hinckley 1975). An earlier experiment showed no sig-
nificant difference (p . 0.05) in CL between needles
measured immediately after collection from the tree
and those stored as described for up to 4 hours (data
not shown), which is similar to results for other conifers
(Kaufmann & Thor 1982). Also, the first three needles
having 
 
CL measurements within 0.1 MPa were aver-
aged and used as the CL for each tree (Schmid et al.
1991).
Pretreatment mineral soils were collected in the sum-
mer of 1993 to a depth of 15 cm from one location in
each of 52 plots randomly located in patches dominated
by presettlement trees, postsettlement trees, and bunch-
grass openings. The soil was air-dried and sieved to ,2
mm, and rock-free samples were ground with mortar
and pestle to a flour-like consistency. Soil OM was de-
termined by mass loss following ignition after heating
crucibles containing about 1 g of the soil at 5508C for 5
hours to consume the organic matter by oxidation (Chap-
man 1976). Soil [NT] and [PT] were determined colori-
metrically on a LACHAT flow-injection analyzer (Quik-
Chem AE Automated Ion Analyzer System, LACHAT
ZELLWEGER Analytic Instruments Inc., Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, U.S.A.) following modified micro-Kjeldahl
digestion procedures (Parkinson & Allen 1975; Jones &

thinned blocks, except for the age of the trees that were
used in the 1994 post-treatment comparisons (Table 1).
The 10 presettlement trees in the thinned block were
significantly younger than the 10 presettlement trees in
the control block. Because leaf physiological character-
istics of ponderosa pine can vary with tree age (Yoder et
al. 1994), tree age was used as a covariate to adjust
means to the same average age in all post-treatment
analyses that compared trees between thinned and con-
trol blocks. Overall, the results of the pretreatment com-
parisons show similar levels of soil resource availability
and tree-to-tree competition for the control and thinned
blocks prior to thinning.
Posttreatment Comparisons
Soil volumetric moisture content (u), CL, needle gas ex-
change, and foliar [NT] and [PT] were compared between
the 10 presettlement trees in the control block and the
10 presettlement trees in the thinned block in the first
growing season following thinning (May-August, 1994).
In September 1994, needle, stem, and bud length, bud
mass, and foliar [NT] and [PT] were compared across
canopy crown positions and between treatments.
Soil u was measured weekly, and CL and leaf physio-
logical characteristics were measured at 2-week inter-
vals. Measurements of u (Topp et al. 1982a,1982b; Run-
del & Jarrell 1989) were at the canopy drip-line and
southeast of each tree over 0–15 and 15–30 cm of min-
eral soil depth using a time domain reflectometry sys-
tem (Model 6050X1 Trase System I, Soilmoisture Equip-
ment Corp., Santa Barbara, California, U.S.A.). Midday
CL was measured for a randomly selected half of the
trees from each treatment block during the 90 minutes
before noon and, for the remainder of the trees, during
the 90 minutes after noon. Both predawn and midday
CL of all 20 trees were measured on the same day, ex-
cept for 28 July and 11 August, when midday CL was
measured on the following day. Time of measure-
ment—before noon or after noon—was not a significant
(p . 0.05) source of variation in midday CL (data not
shown).
Trees were sampled for 
 
CL by cutting one twig from
the lower canopy of each tree with a pole pruner. Only
twigs that were in full sun were sampled at midday.
Immediately after each twig was detached from the
tree, the previous year’s needles were cut from three
fascicles just distal to the fascicle sheath. A preliminary
experiment showed that the CL of needles cut within 20
seconds of twig detachment was not significantly dif-
ferent (p . 0.05) from the CL of needles cut directly
from the tree (data not shown). Measurements of CL
were restricted to needles that elongated in 1993 at all
sampling dates, except in August, when needles that
elongated in 1994 were also measured. Techniques for
measuring CL were similar to those described for the
pretreatment comparisons.
We measured needle gas exchange at midday at a
photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) greater than
1000 mmol/m2/second using the same detached twigs
sampled for the midday CL measurements. Light satu-
ration of net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and stomatal con-
ductance to water vapor (Gw) for ponderosa pine occurs
at a PPFD of about 600 mmol/m2/second (Bassman
1987; Kolb & Robberecht 1996). On cloudy days, a lamp
(75W halogen 12VDC) was used to maintain a mini-
mum of 1000 mmol/m2/second PPFD. Each needle gas
exchange measurement was made in less than 205 sec-
onds after twig detachment with six fully expanded
needles (i.e., two three-needle fascicles) from the most
distal needles of the age class. Another preliminary ex-
periment showed similar Pn and Gw for up to about 250
seconds for needles on detached twigs as for those on
twigs attached to the tree (data not shown). Gas ex-
change was also measured on needles that elongated in
the current year (1994) in August, when they were long
enough to fit into the measurement cuvette.
Pn and Gw were measured with a computer-controlled,
closed-system, portable infrared gas analyzer system
(LI-6200, LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska, U.S.A.). The
needle gas exchange measurements were made between
10:30 to 13:30 hours using the same schedule described
for the midday CL measurements. Time of measure-
ment (before noon or after noon) was not a significant
(p . 0.05) source of variation in Pn or Gw (data not
shown).
Pn was calculated on the basis of total needle surface
area by using the length and the average diameter of
the needles placed in the measurement chamber based
on an approximation of a cylinder consisting of three
isometric needle components (Svenson & Davies 1992).
Because there was a strong positive correlation between
treatment-by-date means of Gw and Pn (r 5 0.90, n 5 16,
p , 0.0001), only the Pn data are presented.
Foliage [NT] and [PT] were measured on needle sam-
ples of the same age class from the same twigs used for
other physiological measurements. Needles were ground
to pass through a 20-mesh screen with a Thomas-Wiley
intermediate mill (3383-L10 series, Thomas Scientific,
Swedesboro, New Jersey, U.S.A.). The [NT] and [PT]
were determined colorimetrically in a similar manner to
that used with the pretreatment soil samples. [NT] and
[PT] were calculated on the basis of needle surface area
to facilitate comparisons with Pn, and on the basis of
needle dry mass to facilitate comparisons with most
other studies.
In September 1994, sunlit twigs from upper-, middle-,
and lower-canopy positions of all 20 study trees were
sampled for an analysis of twig growth and needle [NT]

177
and [PT]. Twigs from the lower canopy and from some
of the middle canopy were sampled with a pole pruner.
The upper-canopy twigs and the balance of the middle-
canopy twigs were sampled by means of 12-gauge buck
shot and a shotgun. Two twigs from each canopy loca-
tion were collected, and the length, diameter, and oven-
dry mass of their terminal buds were measured. Stem
elongation and the length of the longest needles were
measured on both the 1993 and 1994 year’s growth on
these twigs.
Data Analyses
All statistical tests were conducted with a significance
level threshold of p < 0.05 by means of SAS software
(SAS Institute, Inc. 1989). A one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was used to compare control and thinned
treatment blocks for each of the eight dates. Tree age
was used as a covariate to adjust all means to a common
tree age for all variables except u. For the August sam-
ple dates, a two-way ANOVA was used with needle
age class (1993, 1994), treatment, and their interaction as
factors. For the September sampling over canopy posi-
tions, a three-way ANOVA was used to compare treat-
ments, crown positions, year of needle elongation (1993,
1994), and their interactions for needle [NT] and [PT]
and with tree age as a covariate. The other twig, needle,
and bud characteristics from September were analyzed
with a two-way ANOVA, with treatment, canopy posi-
tion, and their interaction as factors and tree age as a co-
variate. To adjust for any pretreatment differences in
twig and needle growth, maximum 1993 needle length
was used as an additional covariate for the analysis of
maximum 1994 needle length, and 1993 stem length as an
additional covariate for the analysis of 1994 stem length.
Results
The u0–15 decreased from May to mid-July, and then in-
creased during monsoonal rains in late July and August
(Figs. 4A and 4C). A similar temporal trend occurred
for u15–30, but with less soil water recharge from the
monsoonal rains (Fig. 4B). The u0–15 was higher in the
thinned treatment versus the control treatment on ev-
ery date and was significantly higher on six of the 15
dates (Fig. 4A). The u15–30 also tended to be higher in the
thinned treatment versus the control treatment, but the
differences were not significant (Fig. 4B).
Predawn CL varied between about 20.5 and 21.0
MPa, with the lowest values ocurring in mid-July and
late August (Fig. 5A). Predawn CL was significantly
higher in the thinned treatment than in the control
treatment on 16 July for 1-year-old needles and on 26
August for both 1-year-old and current-year needles
(Fig. 5A), with no significant differences between treat-
ments on other dates. Although predawn CL differed
significantly between 1-year-old and current-year nee-
dles in August, the treatment-by-needle-age interaction
was not significant, indicating similar differences in
predawn CL between the thinned and control blocks for
both needle ages.
Midday CL varied between about 21.3 and 21.7 MPa
and generally decreased throughout the season (Fig.
5B). Midday CL was significantly higher in the control
treatment than in the thinned treatment on 16 June and
26 August (Fig. 5B), with no significant differences be-
tween treatments on other dates. On 26 August, treat-
ment differences in midday CL depended on needle
age, as indicated by a significant treatment-by-needle-
age interaction. Specifically, midday CL for both nee-
dle-age classes was higher in the control than in the
Figure 4. Average volumetric water content (u) of the mineral 
soil over 0–15 cm (A) and 15–30 cm (B) for thinned and control 
treatments on 15 dates. Error bars show one standard error of 
the mean. Treatment means differed significantly (p < 0.05) on 
the dates marked with an asterisk. Daily precipitation for May

thinned treatment, but the difference was greater for
1993 needles (Fig. 5B).
Pn did not differ significantly between treatments ex-
cept on 26 August, when the Pn of both 1-year-old and
current-year needles was higher in the thinned than in
the control treatment (Fig. 6). Also, treatment differ-
ences in Pn approached statistical significance on 16
July (p 5 0.07), when Pn was again higher in the thinned
than in the control treatment (Fig. 6).
The [NT] of 1-year-old needles tended to be greater in
the thinned than in the control treatment in July and
August, but treatments differed significantly only on 16
July on the basis of needle area (Fig. 7). The [NT] of cur-
rent-year needles in August also tended to be higher in
the thinned treatment than in the control treatment, but
the differences were not significant. In August and Sep-
tember, current-year needles had significantly greater
[NT] than 1-year-old needles on the basis of needle mass
(Fig. 7B).
The [PT] of 1-year-old needles did not differ signifi-
cantly between thinned and control treatments except
on 16 June, when [PT] was higher in the control on the
basis of mass (Fig. 8). In August and September, cur-
rent-year needles had significantly greater [PT] than
1-year-old needles on the basis of needle area and mass
(Fig. 8).
In September, the length of the longest current-year
needles was significantly greater in the thinned than in
the control treatment (Table 2). There was also a signifi-
cant difference between thinned and control treatments
for bud growth. Buds were significantly longer, wider,
and heavier in the thinned than in the control treatment
(Table 2). Bud diameter also differed significantly across
canopy positions: the widest buds occurred in the up-
per canopy and the narrowest buds the lower canopy
(Table 2). The treatment-by-canopy-position interaction
was significant only for bud mass, for which the dif-
ference between the thinned and control treatments in-
creased from the lower canopy to the upper canopy
(Table 2). There were no statistically significant differ-
ences between treatments or canopy positions for stem
elongation. The [PT] and [NT] of needles also did not
differ significantly among canopy positions (data not
shown).
Discussion
Our leaf physiological data should be interpreted with
the caveat that all measurements were made in the
lower portion of the canopy of large trees. Of the physi-
ological variables that we measured, differences among
the lower-, middle-, and upper-canopy positions were
likely greatest for CL because of the decrease in CL that

often occurs with increasing tree height (Fredericksen
et al. 1996; Ryan & Yoder 1997). Exposure to sunlight
for much of the day was similar for these canopy po-
sitions of the presettlement trees because there was
little shading of the canopy by other trees, even in
the control treatment. Foliage [NT], a good predictor
of leaf gas-exchange characteristics (Kozlowski & Pal-
lardy 1997; Reich et al. 1997), also did not differ among
lower-, middle-, and upper-canopy positions. Thus, our
use of the lower canopy for the leaf physiological mea-
surements likely resulted in values of CL that were
greater (less negative) than would have been found
higher in the canopy. Our Pn values for the lower can-
opy may be greater than would have been found higher
in the canopy because of the greater CL in the lower
canopy.
Thinning of the postsettlement trees increased the
needle length and bud size of the presettlement trees,
indicating a negative influence of postsettlement trees
on the growth of presettlement trees. This conclusion
agrees with the results of two correlative studies at our
study site (Sutherland 1983; Biondi 1996), where growth
rates of the presettlement trees have declined since the
establishment of the postsettlement trees.
Because the postsettlement trees generally did not
shade the crowns of the presettlement trees, the nega-
tive influence of the postsettlement trees on the preset-
tlement trees likely resulted from competition for soil
resources. Of the characteristics that we measured,
competition for soil water between postsettlement and
presettlement trees best explains the positive growth re-
sponse of the presettlement trees to thinning of the
postsettlement trees. The u0–15 was consistently higher
in the thinned than in the control treatment, with signif-
icant differences on several dates. Because the majority
of conifer roots occur near the soil surface (Curtis 1964;
Vogt et al. 1987; Grier 1989; Jackson et al. 1996), thin-
ning of the postsettlement trees should have reduced
active tree-root density near the soil surface, making
more soil water available to the remaining presettle-
ment trees. Indeed, the larger difference in u between
treatments at the 0–15 cm depth compared with the
15–30 cm depth likely resulted from the presence of
most of the fine roots of the competing postsettlement
trees near the soil surface. Our results on the short-term
effects of thinning on soil water content agree with
most previous similar studies of conifers (Della-Bianca

Helvey 1975; Donner & Running 1986; Aussenac &
Granier 1988; Cregg et al. 1990; Stogsdill et al. 1991). Fi-
nally, significantly greater predawn CL in the thinned
than in the control treatment provides further evidence
that the thinning increased water availability to the pre-
settlement trees.
While the thinning treatment increased u0–15 and pre-
dawn CL on some dates, midday CL was significantly
lower in the thinned than in the control treatment on
two dates. This difference may have resulted from a
higher transpiration rate by the presettlement trees in
the thinned versus the control treatment as a conse-
quence of greater Gw.
Nitrogen is generally recognized as limiting ponde-
rosa pine growth in northern Arizona (Potter 1964;
Klemmedson et al. 1990). At our study site, Kaye &
Hart (1998) reported an increase in gross organic nitro-
gen mineralization and a decrease in gross nitrate im-
mobilization in the thinned treatment versus the con-
trol. Consistent with this increase in soil nitrogen
mineralization, presettlement trees in the thinned treat-
ment showed greater nitrogen uptake that resulted
from a small increase in needle [NT] combined with an
increase in needle length. Consequently, we conclude
that the postsettlement and presettlement trees were
competing for nitrogen, and that increased nitrogen up-
take was partially responsible for the stimulation of pre-
settlement canopy growth by the restoration treatment.
In contrast, there is no evidence that the postsettle-
ment and presettlement trees were competing for phos-
phorus. Needle [PT] did not differ significantly between
treatments except for one date, when [PT] was lower in
the thinned than in the control treatment, perhaps be-
cause of a growth dilution effect (Kozlowski & Pallardy
1997). Also, there is evidence suggesting that phospho-
rus may not be limiting to ponderosa pine at our study
site. In a greenhouse fertilizer trial using ponderosa
pine seedlings in soil from a ponderosa pine stand with
basalt-derived soil similar to that of our study, Potter
(1964) found no growth response to the addition of
phosphorus and concluded that it was not deficient.
Klemmedson (1994) and Wright (1996) studied soils
near our study site at the Chimney Springs Prescribed
Burning Interval Study, Fort Valley Experimental For-
est, and concluded that the soil was rich in phosphorus
due to the basal parent material.
The restoration treatment also increased carbon up-
take by the presettlement trees. On 16 July, Pn was
about 100% greater in the thinned treatment than in the
control treatment, and the difference approached statis-
tical significance (p 5 0.07). On 26 August, Pn differed
significantly between treatments and was about 40%
greater in the thinned treatment than in the control
treatment for 1-year-old needles and about 80% greater
for current-year needles. For current-year needles,
greater Pn (Fig. 6) combined with longer needle length
in the thinned versus the control treatment (Table 2) re-
sulted in a substantial increase in photosynthetic capac-
ity, which also contributed to the greater canopy growth
in the thinned treatment.
In summary, our results support our initial hypothe-
sis that restoration of the pre-Euro-American stand
structure by thinning would improve the vigor of an-
cient, presettlement ponderosa pines. Increased canopy
growth and increased uptake of water, nitrogen, and

suggest that appropriate forest management can be
used to maintain scarce, presettlement trees in the pon-
