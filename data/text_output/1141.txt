Climate change is altering the distribution of woody plants by influencing demographic processes and modifying 
disturbance regimes. Trailing-edge forests may be particularly vulnerable to these effects because they exist at 
warm, dry margins of tree distributions. To better understand recent climate-driven changes in trailing-edge 
forests, we used Landsat time series and 1558 field reference plots to develop annual land cover maps from 
1985 to 2020 in two large, biodiverse landscapes in central Arizona, USA. We then combined annual land cover 
maps with tree ring records and spatial data describing interannual climate, terrain, bark beetle (Curculionidae: 
Scolytinae) activity, wildfire, and harvest to quantify drivers of forest change. Throughout the two landscapes, 
forest extent declined by 0.3 % and 0.8 % from 1985 to 2020. However, considerable variation occurred within 
the study period, with abrupt (ca. 1–2 years) declines in forest extent followed by gradual (ca. 10 years) recovery 
on each landscape. Pinyon-juniper (Pinus edulis, Pinus monophylla, and/or Juniperus spp.) cover increased from 
1985 to ca. 2000 but declined after 2000, a period of extreme drought and regional tree die-off. In contrast, pine- 
oak (Pinus ponderosa and Quercus spp.) cover increased from 2000 to 2020, primarily due to declines in pon­
derosa pine and mixed conifer cover over the same period. Wildfire was a key driver of transitions from forest to 
non-forest cover in our study area, with the occurrence of multiple compounded drought years playing an 
important role in unburned areas. By driving transitions to alternative forest types or non-forest cover, distur­
bance and drought will increasingly shape forest dynamics and ecosystem transformations throughout the 
southwestern US.   
1. Introduction 
Anthropogenic climate change is altering plant demographics and 
amplifying climate-sensitive disturbances, with the potential to rapidly 
transform vegetation communities (McDowell et al., 2020). In forests of 
the western US, recent changes in climate have increased tree mortality 
rates (van Mantgem et al., 2009), altered fecundity (Clark et al., 2021), 
and reduced the probability of tree establishment (Andrus et al., 2018; 
Stevens-Rumann et al., 2018). At the same time, warming temperatures 
have triggered widespread bark beetle outbreaks (Curculionidae: Sco­
lytinae; Raffa et al., 2008, Bentz et al., 2010) and increases in severe 
wildfire activity (Parks and Abatzoglou, 2020; Singleton et al., 2019). In 
combination, these changes in ecosystem dynamics are altering forest 
extent and composition throughout western US forests (Batllori et al., 
2020; Coop et al., 2020; Homer et al., 2020). Because forests provide 
critical ecosystem services (Costanza et al., 2014), strategies that 
anticipate climate-driven changes in forest disturbances, recovery pro­
cesses, and comdrymunity dynamics will play an increasingly important 
role in forest management (Baker, 2021; Seidl and Turner, 2022). 
To develop plans for intervention, forest managers require an un­
derstanding of ecosystem transformations (i.e., a dramatic shift in 
multiple ecological characteristics of an ecosystem), their causal 
mechanisms, and whether accepting such transformations will lead to 
undesirable outcomes (Aplet and Mckinley, 2017; Crausbay et al., 
2022). Trailing-edge forests, which exist at the warm, dry margins of 
current forest distributions, may be the first to respond to a warming 
climate (Parks et al., 2019; Svenning and Sandel, 2013). These forests 
serve as a “canary in the coal mine”, acting as initial indicators of 
climate-driven transformation throughout western US forests. Lower 
treelines are broadly constrained by temperature and moisture

availability (Urza et al., 2020), and early warning signs of forest change 
such as recruitment failure have become increasingly common 
throughout trailing-edge systems (Davis et al., 2019; Rodman et al., 
2020). As climate change pushes additional forest populations and 
communities outside of their environmental niche (Loehman et al., 
2018; Rehfeldt et al., 2006; Turner et al., 2021), retrospective studies of 
trailing-edge forest dynamics will provide insight into the potential for 
future transformations across other less immediately vulnerable forests. 
Therefore, elucidating recent climate-driven shifts in trailing-edge sys­
tems is critical to improving the mechanistic understanding of forest 
transformation across a range of ecosystems. 
Ecosystem transformation in trailing-edge forests can be driven by 
processes operating at a range of spatial and temporal scales which can 
complicate monitoring and change attribution. For example, drought 
can lead to tree die-off events with variable effects across landscapes or 
regions (Breshears et al., 2005), whereas severe fires and harvests are 
comparatively small and have discrete boundaries (White et al., 2017). 
Similarly, wildfires rapidly alter forests, but bark beetle outbreaks may 
take several years to affect a single forest stand (Meddens and Hicke, 
2014; Rodman et al., 2021b), and forest recovery from some distur­
bances unfolds over decades (Baker, 2018; Haire and McGarigal, 2010). 
To monitor forest changes and their causal drivers, frequent and 
consistent measurements are valuable, particularly when these mea­
surements align with spatial and temporal scales of the processes of 
interest (Kennedy et al., 2014; Wiens, 1989). Landsat imagery is un­
matched in its temporal depth (ca. 1970s-present), with frequent revisit 
times (i.e., 16 days for each satellite), global spatial coverage, and a 
relatively high spatial resolution (ca. 15–120 m), making these data 
ideal for broad-scale forest monitoring (Wulder et al., 2019). Though 
Landsat-based methods to track annual changes in land cover are 
nascent (G´omez et al., 2016; but see Hermosilla et al., 2018), such 
detailed temporal information is critical when attributing changes to 
causal mechanisms such as drought and/or wildfire that operate annual 
or sub-annual time scales. 
The Mogollon Highlands Ecoregion (MHE) in Arizona and New 
Mexico, USA is a biogeographic transition zone located between upland 
ecosystems of the southern Colorado Plateau and desert ecosystems of 
the Basin and Range Province (Fig. 1; Fleischner et al., 2017). Increases 
in temperature and aridity have been widespread throughout the MHE 
in recent decades, and these trends are expected to continue at some of 
the greatest rates in western North America (Seager et al., 2013; Wil­
liams et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2020). Climate change has had notable 
effects on MHE forest ecosystems since ca. 2000 (Breshears et al., 2005; 
Guiterman et al., 2022; Woolman et al., 2022). However, like many 
transition zones, the MHE is an area of exceptionally high biodiversity 
(Araújo, 2002; Fleischner et al., 2017). Broad elevational gradients and 
rugged topography in this area create a landscape template that supports 
a mosaic of mesic and xeric plant communities. Such communities have 
a range of adaptive traits, leading to variable responses to warming and 
drying (Aubin et al., 2016; Marshall and Falk, 2020; Stevens et al., 
2015). For example, the MHE includes the warm, dry edge of montane 
tree species such as ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum 
[Englem.]), as well as the cool, wet edge of Madrean conifers (e.g., 
Juniperus deppeana [Steud.]) and oak species (Quercus spp.) that domi­
nate xeric southern ecosystems (Wilson et al., 2013). While Madrean 
species in the MHE might be expected to demonstrate resilience to 
drought and warming, montane tree species such as ponderosa pine 
might be particularly vulnerable. Thus, through both high climate ve­
locity and species diversity, the MHE offers an ideal case study of recent 
climate impacts in trailing-edge forest systems. 
To better understand ecosystem transformations in trailing-edge 
forests, we used Landsat time series (LTS) and a large field inventory 
dataset (n = 1,558 field plots) to develop annual maps of land cover and 
forest extent from 1985 to 2020 in two study landscapes in the MHE 
(Fig. 1). We then combined these maps with in-situ records of plant 
moisture stress (i.e., tree ring series) and spatial data describing inter­
annual climate, terrain, and disturbance to quantify potential drivers of 
cover type change. While we focused broadly on forest community-level

responses and changes among cover types, we also emphasized changes 
in cover types that included ponderosa pine, one of the most widespread 
and abundant tree species in the western US (Wilson et al., 2013) and a 
species of local management concern. We asked the following questions 
– Q1: How did forest extent change across two trailing-edge landscapes from 
1985 to 2020? Q2: How did the extent of individual cover types change 
throughout the study period and what are the most common types of transi­
tions among cover types? Q3: What are the most important drivers of tran­
sitions from ponderosa pine-dominated cover types to non-forest? Because 
trailing-edge forests are particularly vulnerable to climate and the 
early 2000s represented a period of extreme drought (Williams et al., 
2022), we expected that total forest extent (quantified using annual land 
cover maps) has declined in each landscape throughout the study 
period. We also expected that xeric cover types (e.g., pinyon-juniper and 
pine-oak), would be most resilient to drought, whereas mesic cover 
types (e.g., mixed conifer and ponderosa pine) would transition towards 
xeric cover types or non-forest. Finally, we expected that ponderosa 
pine-dominated cover types would be at the greatest risk of conversion 
to non-forest following severe disturbances (e.g., wildfires and bark 
beetle outbreaks), though drought would play an important role in un­
disturbed areas. 
2. Methods 
2.1. Study area 
Our study area is located in two landscapes on the Prescott and Tonto 
National Forests (hereafter, ‘Prescott’ and ‘Tonto’) in central Arizona, 
USA. Prescott and Tonto were defined based on administrative bound­
aries; specifically, the Bradshaw and the west side of the Chino Valley 
Ranger Districts on the Prescott National Forest, and the Payson and 
Pleasant Valley Ranger Districts on the Tonto National Forest. Tonto was 
further restricted to areas above ca. 1,600 m elevation and adjacent to 
upland plateaus because lower elevations adjacent to this landscape 
typically had little to no forest cover. We also excluded urban areas and 
highly developed lands within each landscape from our analyses. The 
final sizes of the study landscapes were 318,320 ha and 104,002 ha for 
Prescott and Tonto, respectively. Forests in the study area have been 
impacted by legacies of past land use since Euro-American colonization 
ca. 1860 – extractive logging, overgrazing, and fire exclusion (Huffman 
et al., 2020). Similarly, because Indigenous Peoples in the Southwest 
have managed forests and wildfire for millennia (Carter et al., 2021; 
Roos et al., 2021), their killing and forced displacement due to Euro- 
American colonization is likely to have had effects on current forest 
conditions, though such effects are not well understood in our study 
area. 
Prescott and Tonto span broad elevational gradients (c. 700–2,500 
m, USGS, 2021), which drive variation in mean annual temperature 
(9.7–19.3 ◦C), total precipitation (300–900 mm yr−1) (1991–2020 
climate normals; PRISM, 2022), and plant community composition. 
Common tree species in the MHE (ranked from wet to dry habitat as­
sociations) include white fir (Abies concolor var. concolor [Gordon] 
Lindley ex Hildebrand), southwestern white pine (Pinus strobiformis 
[Englem.]), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca [Mayr] 
Franco), ponderosa pine, two-needle pinyon pine (Pinus edulis 
[Engelm.]), one-needle pinyon pine (Pinus monophylla subsp. fallax) and 
juniper species (alligator juniper, Juniperus deppeana [Steud.]; Utah ju­
niper, Juniperus osteosperma [Torr.] Little; and one-seed juniper, Juni­
perus monosperma [Englem.] Sarg.). Oak species (e.g., Gambel oak, 
Quercus gambelii Nutt.; Emory oak, Quercus emoryi Torr.; and turbinella 
oak, Quercus turbinella Greene; Arizona white oak, Quercus arizonica 
Sarg.) are also present, and can attain tree or shrub form depending on 
age, site conditions, and browse pressure. While all coniferous trees (i.e., 
genera Abies, Juniperus, Pinus, and Pseudotsuga) are evergreen in our 
study area, oak species can be winter-deciduous (Gambel oak), drought- 
deciduous (Emory oak), or evergreen (turbinella oak and Arizona white 
oak). Manzanita (Arctostaphylus spp.) and Fendler’s ceonothus (Ceono­
thus fendleri A. Gray) are common woody shrubs, and sedges (Carex 
spp.), meadow grass (Poa spp.), and bottlebrush grass (Elymus spp.) are 
common herbaceous plants. 
2.2. Data collection and processing – training data for remote sensing 
image classification 
To train classifications of annual land cover maps, we collected 
reference data on 1,558 field plots in 2019 and 2020 (Table 1, Fig. 2, 
Appendix A). At each field plot, we identified one of five dominant land 
cover types based on the criteria in Table 1. Mixed conifer, ponderosa 
pine, pine-oak, and pinyon-juniper types had overstory (i.e., trees 
exceeding species-specific diameter thresholds) canopy cover ≥25 %, 
whereas non-forest had < 25 % overstory tree cover. We identified plot 
locations in a GIS using a stratified random sample of land cover types, 
canopy cover, and aspect (Appendix A). Upon navigating to each iden­
tified plot location, we determined the existing land cover type based on 
the field protocol described in Appendix A. To improve sampling rep­
resentation of the non-forest class, we supplemented field plots with 762 
points from manual image interpretation of 2019 National Agriculture 
Imagery Program (NAIP) data (NAIP, 2020), 1-m resolution images 
available through Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al., 2017). All in­
terpretations of 2019 NAIP imagery were performed by a single analyst 
and points were located selectively, spanning a range of non-forest 
conditions (i.e., shrub, grass, bare soil, roads, developed surfaces). We 
attempted to maximize geographic coverage within each landscape and 
identified an equal number of air photo points on the two landscapes. 
2.3. Data collection and processing – Spatial predictors of annual land 
cover types 
As a predictor of land cover types, we obtained and processed 
Landsat Tier 1 Surface Reflectance imagery collected from 1985 to 2020 
(Fig. 3, Appendix B). Within each Landsat scene, we masked pixels 
obstructed by clouds, shadows, snow, or water using the CFMask- 
derived quality assurance band (Foga et al., 2017). We then merged 
(using the pixel-wise median) scenes within spring (March 15-June 14), 
summer (June 15-September 14), and fall (September 15-December 14) 
seasons within each calendar year to develop composite images. We 
developed separate composites by season to differentiate between de­
ciduous and evergreen vegetation. Next, we used seasonal image com­
posites to calculate nine spectral indices as potential predictors of land 
cover (Table 2). To reduce temporal noise and fill occasional data gaps,

we developed hindsight-enhanced image time series (i.e., “fit-to-vertex 
values”) for all seasonal spectral indices using LandTrendr (Kennedy 
et al., 2018, 2010). Following Rodman et al. (2021a), we developed an 
additional set of predictors using spatial segmentation of each seasonal 
index, thereby reducing spatial noise and incorporating local context 
(Appendix B). In total, we developed 54 Landsat-derived spectral pre­
dictors of cover types in each year – 9 indices in each of 3 seasons, with 
and without spatial segmentation (i.e., 9*3*2 potential predictors). To 
characterize topographic conditions that might explain variation in land 
cover, we derived elevation, topographic position index (TPI; Weiss, 
2001), and the continuous heat load index (HLI; indicative of terrain- 
driven solar heating) (Theobald et al., 2015) from a ca. 10-m digital 
elevation model (USGS, 2021). We aggregated and aligned all spatial 
datasets to the same 30-m reference grid, extracting seasonal spectral 
indices (in the years of training data collection), elevation, TPI, and HLI 
values at the center of each field plot or air photo interpretation point. 
2.4. Data collection and processing – classification of annual land cover 
types 
Using spatial data extracted from training point locations, we 
developed Random Forest (RF; Breiman 2001) classifiers to predict land 
cover types across each landscape. Here, land cover classifications were 
derived from two individual RF models (i.e., a ‘two-stage’ classifier). 
Model 1 was used with all training data (n = 2,320) to assign pixels to 
forest or non-forest cover, based solely on spectral characteristics (Fig. 3; 
Table 2). Model 2 was used with only training data from forest or 
woodland classes (n = 1,329) to assign pixels to mixed conifer, pon­
derosa pine, pine-oak, or pinyon-juniper types based on spectral char­
acteristics and terrain variables (i.e., elevation, TPI, HLI) (Fig. 3; 
Table 2). Terrain variables were excluded from Model 1 because they 
created unrealistic patterns of non-forest cover throughout each land­
scape. For each RF model, we selected a parsimonious subset of 10–30 
spatial predictors using the Variable Selection Using Random Forests 
(VSURF) algorithm (Genuer et al., 2015). We accounted for class 
imbalance in the training datasets using a cost-sensitive learning 
approach, which places greater importance on the classification of 
training points from underrepresented classes (Zhu et al., 2018). We 
defined weights as the inverse of class prevalence using the following 
equation: 
ClassWti = 1/(ni/n)
(1) 
where n is defined as the sample size of the training data and i rep­
resents class i. We tuned RF parameters (e.g., minimum node size, 
number of variables at each split) using cross-validation in the ‘caret’ 
package (Kuhn et al., 2019) and developed final RF models in the 
‘ranger’ package in R (Wright and Ziegler, 2017). To visualize class 
separability in final models, we used non-metric multidimensional 
scaling in the ‘vegan’ package in R (Oksanen et al., 2019). Finally, we 
used permutation-based variable importance and accumulated local 
effect plots (ALE) in the ‘ranger’ (Wright and Ziegler, 2017) and ‘iml’ 
packages (Molnar et al., 2018), respectively, to interpret the influence of 
predictors retained in final RF models. 
Using spatial predictors (i.e., Landsat-derived seasonal indices and 
terrain variables) and final RF models, we developed annual land cover 
maps of Tonto and Prescott from 1985 to 2020. Annual predictive maps 
were developed by assigning pixels to forest or non-forest cover in Model 
1 and assigning Model 1-classified “forest” pixels to the predicted cover 
type from Model 2. To evaluate the predictive performance of final RF 
models and resultant maps, we used 20-fold cross-validation, where 5 % 
subsets of the training data were withheld in each fold to evaluate the 
accuracy of the final two-stage classification. We calculated the 
balanced accuracy of model predictions (most appropriate for an 
imbalanced training dataset) using the ‘yardstick’ package in R (Kuhn 
and Vaughan, 2021), but also present a confusion matrix in Table C.1 
following standard protocol (Congalton, 1991). 
2.5. Data collection and processing – Proxies for drought stress and 
disturbance 
To contextualize remotely sensed estimates of land cover change, we 
developed datasets describing variation in tree moisture stress and 
interannual climate. First, we created ponderosa pine tree ring chro­
nologies using increment cores from stands (n = 99 cores from 27 plots) 
without evidence of recent harvest or disturbance. Because tree ring 
data were collected in 2018, we only present the 1985–2017 period for 
our study area. Sampled trees ranged in size from 8.7 to 76.4 cm (me­
dian = 26.6 cm) in diameter at breast height (DBH; 1.37 m above ground 
level). In the laboratory, increment cores were mounted and surfaced 
following standard dendrochronological techniques (Stokes and Smiley, 
1996). We recorded annual ring widths using a measuring stage (0.001 
mm precision; Velmex, Bloomfield, NY) with Measure J2X software 
(VoorTech Consulting, Holderness, NH) and verified dating accuracy

using COFECHA (Holmes, 1983). To highlight tree ring growth re­
sponses to interannual climate, we detrended each series using 
smoothing splines with a fixed width of 63.3 years (i.e., 67 % of the 
mean series length; Klesse 2021) and merged individual series into 
standardized chronologies for each landscape using Tukey’s bi-weight 
robust mean (Cook and Kairiukstis, 1990). We performed detrending 
and developed chronologies in the ‘dplR’ package in R (Bunn, 2008). We 
also calculated the Forest Drought Stress Index (FDSI; Williams et al., 
2012) at a 4-km spatial resolution using data from the Parameter- 
elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM, 2022). 
Negative FDSI values are indicative of stressful conditions for trees in a 
given year relative to the longer-term (i.e., 1896–2007) average at a site. 
To describe disturbance activity in each landscape, we developed 
time series of the area affected by wildfire, bark beetles, and harvests. To 
calculate the annual area burned within each landscape, we obtained 
fire perimeters intersecting the study area from 1985 to 2020 from the 
USDA Forest Service (USFS, 2022), the Monitoring Trends in Burn 
Severity (MTBS) program (Eidenshink et al., 2007), and the National 
Interagency Fire Center (NIFC, 2022). Following Parks et al. (2018), we 
calculated fire severity using the relative differenced Normalized Burn 
Ratio (RdNBR; Miller and Thode 2007) with 30-m image composites 
from years immediately preceding and following fire occurrence. Within 
fire perimeters, we summarized burned areas as pixels with RdNBR > 0, 
and high-severity areas as pixels with RdNBR > 687 (Singleton et al., 
2021).We obtained harvest records from 1985 to 2020 from the Forest 
Service Activity Tracking System (FACTS) dataset (USFS, 2021a), using 
all activities that related to tree removal with a certified completion 
date. Lastly, we used data from Hicke et al. (2020) to describe the 
timing, occurrence, and severity of insect-caused tree mortality 
throughout each landscape. These data, derived from USDA Forest

Service Aerial Detection Surveys (USFS, 2021b) and calibrated against 
remotely sensed training data, were produced at a 1-km resolution from 
1997 to 2018. Gridded data describing insect activity outside of 
1997–2018 were unavailable for our study area. 
2.6. Analysis – Q1 and Q2, assessing changes in the extent of land cover 
types 
Using maps of annual land cover, we summarized the proportion of 
each landscape that was classified as a given land cover type in each year 
from 1985 to 2020. To calculate area proportions, we first calculated the 
mapped area of each cover type and then calculated the error-adjusted 
area proportion and 95 % confidence interval of the area estimate 
following Olofsson et al. (2014). We visually and qualitatively assessed 
the amount and timing of changes in each cover type and landscape. We 
also quantified temporal trends in each cover type using Kendall’s cor­
relation coefficient (τ; Kendall 1938), calculated as the rank correlation 
between year and area proportion. As a statistical test of τ (i.e., indi­
cating positive or negative monotonic trends in each time series), we 
used the modified Mann-Kendall trend test of Hamed and Rao (1998). 
2.7. Analysis – Q2, quantifying the types and rates of vegetation 
transitions 
To quantify annualized transition probabilities among cover types 
within each 30-m pixel, we developed a transition matrix by cross- 
tabulating identified cover types from each pixel in a given year (0 yr) 
with the identified land cover type in the subsequent year (+1 yr). This 
process was repeated using all 30-m cells in all pairs of consecutive years 
(i.e., 1985 and 1986, 1986 and 1987, etc.). The summarized transition 
matrix gives the probability of a pixel identified as one cover type 
retaining the same cover type (diagonal on the matrix) or transitioning 
to alternative cover types (off-diagonal) in an average year from 1985 to 
2020. Importantly, this matrix incorporates both ‘true’ and ‘false’ 
transitions (i.e., transitions due to misclassification in one or both of the 
years), and does not consider variation in rates of transition throughout 
the time series (i.e., non-stationarity). Despite these caveats, this 
approach is valuable as an overall indicator of which mapped cover 
types were likely to convert to others, and at what rates during the study 
period. 
2.8. Analysis – Q3, modeling causal drivers of transitions from forest to 
non-forest 
To describe changes in ‘ponderosa pine-dominated’ forests 
throughout each landscape, we visualized the combined area of mixed 
conifer, ponderosa pine, and pine-oak cover types in each year, along 
with tree ring chronologies, FDSI, and disturbance activity. To quantify 
drivers of conversion from ponderosa pine-dominated forest to non- 
forest, we developed a classification tree (CART) model (Breiman 
et al., 1984) in the ‘rpart’ package in R (Therneau et al., 2017) using a 
random sample of 100,000 points. At each point, we developed a 
response variable of ‘transition’ or ‘stability’ at an annual resolution 
from 1986 to 2020, which indicated whether a previously forested site 
transitioned to non-forest in a given year. Potential predictors of tran­
sitions from forest to non-forest in each point were the following: (1) 
FDSI in the focal year (0 yr), the year prior (-1 yr), and two years prior 
(-2 yr); (2) maximum fire severity in 0 yr and −1 yr; (3) presence of 
timber harvest in 0 yr or −1 yr; (4) terrain variables (TPI, HLI, and 
elevation); (5) the identity of the forest landscape (Tonto or Prescott); 
and (6) the identity of the cover type in 1985 (ponderosa, pine-oak, or 
mixed-conifer). We also tested total beetle-caused tree mortality in 0 yr 
and −1 yr for model inclusion in the subset of years for which these data 
were available (1997–2018), however, this predictor did not improve 
model performance. Because of the imbalanced response variable (i.e., 
more site years of ‘stability’ than ‘transition’), we weighted observations 
using the inverse of class prevalence. To reduce overfitting and maintain 
interpretability, we used a maximum depth of three. We used balanced 
accuracy from 20-fold cross-validation to summarize CART model 
performance.

3. Results 
3.1. Q1 – Classification model results and trends in forest cover 
RF classification models of land cover showed an overall balanced 
accuracy of 80.8 % and overall accuracy of 75.8 % in cross-validation 
(Table 3; Table C.1). While there was some confusion among ponder­
osa pine-dominated types (i.e., mixed conifer, ponderosa pine, and pine- 
oak), and between pinyon-juniper and non-forest classes (Table C.1), 
balanced accuracies for each cover type exceeded 70 % (Table 3). 
Furthermore, annual land cover maps matched the expected pattern of 
vegetation gradients throughout the study area and aligned with other 
gridded vegetation datasets (e.g., SW ReGAP, (Lowry et al., 2005); 
LANDFIRE, (Rollins, 2009)), but our maps had a finer temporal reso­
lution for use in land cover change analyses and change attribution. 
Based on annual maps, overall forest cover was relatively stable 
throughout the study period, with net declines of 0.8 % on Prescott and 
0.3 % on Tonto from 1985 to 2020 (Fig. 4). However, there were notable 
years of decline in forest area on each landscape. Specifically, 2002 
(−1.1 % net change) and 2020 (−3.7 %) were years of abrupt decline in 
overall forest area on Prescott, and 1990 (−4.5 %), 2002 (−2.6 %), and 
2020 (−1.9 %) were years of decline on Tonto. On each landscape, 
abrupt declines in forest area were typically followed by gradual re­
covery within ca. 10 years (Fig. 4e, k; Video 1). 
3.2. Q2 – Changes in the extent of each cover type and types of transitions 
Though total forest extent declined by <1 % from 1985 to 2020, 
patterns of change varied widely among individual land cover types and 
between landscapes (Video 1) and few cover types had significant 
monotonic trends (Fig. 4). For many cover types, the 2000s represented 
an important breakpoint, with opposing directions of change before and 
after this period. On Prescott, mixed conifer and ponderosa pine cover 
were relatively consistent through time; however, pine-oak fluctuated, 
with a net decrease of 1.8 % in 2002 and a 3.5 % increase from 2002 to 
2020 (Fig. 4a-c). Pinyon-juniper cover on Prescott increased by 7.3 % 
from 1985 to 2010 but decreased by 8.3 % after 2010 (Fig. 4d). On

Tonto, mixed-conifer and ponderosa pine cover decreased by 3.9 % and 
1.1 %, respectively, throughout the study period (Fig. 4g-h); pine-oak 
decreased by 7.6 % cover from 1985 to 2002, but increased by 9.0 % 
from 2002 to 2020 (Fig. 4i). Pinyon-juniper cover also fluctuated on 
Tonto, increasing by 11.6 % from 1985 to 2004 and decreasing by 7.7 % 
after 2004 (Fig. 4j). Overall, shifts towards more xeric cover types (e.g., 
pine-oak) have become more prevalent since the 2000s. 
Annualized transition rates also varied based on the initial cover type 
and between landscapes (Fig. 5). On average, cover types were more 
likely to retain the same identity than to transition to alternative types in 
a subsequent year (i.e., diagonal probabilities of 0.84–0.96 on Prescott 
and 0.86–0.95 on Tonto; Fig. 5). Pine-oak and pinyon-juniper cover 
were particularly stable, with low probabilities of transition to alterna­
tive cover types on each landscape (<10 % year−1). Though mixed 
conifer was relatively stable through time on the Prescott landscape 
(Fig. 5a), it had high probabilities of transitioning to alternative types on 
Tonto (>10 % year−1) (Fig. 5b). In contrast, ponderosa pine cover was 
relatively stable on Prescott, but likely to convert to other cover types on 
Tonto. Where transitions among cover types occurred, mixed conifer 
was most likely to transition to ponderosa pine or pine-oak cover across 
the two landscapes, and ponderosa pine was most likely to transition to 
pine-oak or pinyon-juniper. On each landscape, probabilities of transi­
tion to non-forest were ca. 2 % year−1 for most forested cover types, 
however, pine-oak had the lowest probability of transition to non-forest 
cover of any cover type. 
3.3. Q3 – Drivers of transitions from forest to non-forest 
Changes in mixed conifer, ponderosa pine, and pine-oak forest extent 
were qualitatively related to interannual climate and disturbance 
(Fig. 6). Ponderosa pine ring-width indices and FDSI were positively 
correlated (Pearson’s r = 0.74 on Prescott; r = 0.69 on Tonto), sup­
porting the use of FDSI as a proxy for plant moisture stress, and together 
defining drought periods in the study area (Fig. 6e-f). Notably, 2002 had 
the lowest FDSI and ring width index values throughout the study 
period, though several drought years occurred throughout the early

2000s. Such years were associated with increases in bark beetle and 
wildfire activity. For example, 2002 was a large fire year on Tonto, with 
5.4 % of the landscape burned (1.3 % at high severity) (Fig. 6h), and 
2003 was the largest year for bark beetle activity, with beetle-caused 
tree mortality on 2.9 % of Prescott and 10.8 % of Tonto (Fig. 6i-j). 
Data from Hicke et al. (2020) indicated that Ips spp. drove most of the 
beetle-caused tree mortality in the early 2000s (with a peak in 2003), 
primarily colonizing pinyon pine and ponderosa pine. FACTS data 
(USFS, 2021a) indicated that rates of harvest varied through time on 
each landscape; rates were lower but more consistent through time on 
Prescott, while Tonto had higher rates of harvest from 2008 to 2020. 
The CART model indicated that fire and drought (i.e., negative FDSI) 
were the best predictors of transition from mixed conifer, ponderosa 
pine, or pine-oak forest to non-forest cover (Fig. 7). Specifically, 66.6 % 
of the sites with an RdNBR ≥136 experienced a transition to non-forest 
in the first year after fire occurrence. In unburned areas and those that 
burned at low severity (i.e., RdNBR< 136), drought was a primary driver 
of conversion to non-forest. Notably, two short-interval drought years 
were more predictive of transitions to non-forest than were single 
drought events; 7.2 % of sites with droughts in the observation year 
(FDSI, 0 Yr < −0.012) and two years prior (FDSI, −2 Yr < −0.066) 
showed transitions to non-forest. In comparison, only 2.8 % of sites with 
a single drought event transitioned to non-forest. The balanced accuracy 
of the CART model was 71.7 % in identifying the locations and years of 
transition. 
4. Discussion 
Trailing-edge forests are among the most climatically vulnerable 
ecosystems in the western US (Parks et al., 2019), providing a natural 
laboratory to explore the causes and consequences of climate-driven 
forest transformation. Thus, an improved understanding of recent 
changes in the extent and composition of trailing-edge forests may 
inform forest management activities seeking to bolster adaptive capacity 
under future climatic conditions across a range of ecosystems. Herein, 
we developed annual maps of land cover in two trailing-edge landscapes 
in Arizona, USA and assessed the roles of interannual climate, terrain, 
and disturbance in driving land cover change. While forest cover was 
relatively stable from 1985 to 2020, we identified notable transitions 
toward more xeric plant communities since ca. 2000 (e.g., mixed conifer 
and ponderosa pine transitioning to pine-oak), mirroring broader-scale 
patterns in the western US caused by disturbance and drought 
(Batllori et al., 2020; Hill and Field, 2021; Stevens et al., 2015). When 
transitions to non-forest cover occurred in our study area, severe wild­
fire and drought were the major drivers of change. 
4.1. Q1 – Changes in forest extent from 1985 to 2020 
Contrary to our expectations of large, climate-driven declines in 
forest extent throughout trailing-edge forests of central Arizona, USA, 
total forest area remained relatively stable throughout the study period, 
with net declines of 0.8 % on Prescott and 0.3 % on Tonto. Across the 
coterminous US, remotely sensed estimates of forest area have shown 
decreases of 4.2 % from 1973 to 2000 and 2.6 % from 2001 to 2016, 
with comparatively greater changes in the western US (Homer et al., 
2020; Sleeter et al., 2013). Similarly, inventory data have documented 
> 10 % net declines in tree density throughout southwestern ponderosa 
pine forests since ca. 2000 (Woolman et al., 2022). In contrast, estimates 
across broader temporal extents suggest that forest cover has remained 
relatively stable across the US since the 1950s (Oswalt et al., 2019). 
Forest cover change reflects dynamic processes of disturbance and re­
covery that operate at varying temporal scales (Kennedy et al., 2014). 
Findings of individual studies are likely to differ based on their temporal 
extent, with longer-term studies better able to capture recovery dy­
namics (e.g., Hansen et al., 2013 vs. Song et al., 2018) as well as gradual 
population declines (Svenning and Sandel, 2013). Therefore, our finding 
of limited forest loss between 1985 and 2020 could partially relate to the 
extended time period of our analysis. However, such findings may also 
reflect the importance of shifts in dominance which maintain forest 
cover but lead to altered species composition. 
4.2. Q2 – Changes in composition and common transitions among cover 
types 
While we found that total forest extent only showed minor declines 
throughout the study period, we also identified important changes in 
species dominance throughout our study area. For example, pine-oak 
cover increased on each landscape from ca. 2000 to 2020, primarily 
due to transitions away from more mesic cover types such as ponderosa 
pine or mixed conifer. Oak species are becoming increasingly dominant 
in other seasonally dry ecosystems due to drought- and beetle-caused 
tree mortality in co-occurring conifers (McIntyre et al., 2015; Young 
et al., 2020). Similarly, severe wildfires can promote a shift towards oak 
species that can resprout from established root systems following topkill

(Coop et al., 2016; Guiterman et al., 2022, 2018); though some Madrean 
conifers (e.g., alligator juniper) are capable of resprouting, oaks typi­
cally do so more aggressively following fire (Barton, 1999; Ful´e and 
Covington, 1998). Disturbance- and climate-driven increases in oak 
dominance are not necessarily detrimental to ecosystems. Oaks are 
widely utilized for habitat and forage by myriad wildlife species (Ber­
nados et al., 2004; Reynolds et al., 1970; Tietje et al., 2005), are 
culturally important to many Indigenous Communities (Souther et al., 
2021), and may represent a more ecologically resilient cover type in the 
face of increasing wildfire and drought (Guiterman et al., 2018; Keyser 
et al., 2020). Indeed, of the land cover types analyzed, we found that 
pine-oak had the lowest probability of transition to non-forest cover. 
Transitions between pinyon-juniper cover and non-forest were also 
common throughout our study period. Specifically, we found increases 
in pinyon-juniper cover on each landscape from 1985 to the 2000s, with 
subsequent transitions toward non-forest through 2020. Throughout the 
20th century, woody plant cover has increased in many of Earth’s 
grassland and savanna ecosystems (Eldridge et al., 2011), and these 
trends have also been documented in parts of the western and south­
western US (Clifford et al., 2011; Weber-Grullon et al., 2022). In 
particular, many grassland and sagebrush communities have transi­
tioned towards pinyon-juniper cover since the early 1900s due to in­
creases in precipitation, elevated atmospheric CO2 and carbon 
fertilization effects, past land clearing or severe fire, cattle grazing, and/ 
or fire exclusion (Amme et al., 2020; Baker and Shinneman, 2004; 
Bradley and Fleishman, 2008; Romme et al., 2009). However, the early 
2000s represent a major deviation in climate from the previous decades. 
The combined effects of bark beetles and drought caused widespread 
tree mortality and dieback across pinyon-juniper communities (Bre­
shears et al., 2005; Clifford et al., 2011; Hicke et al., 2020). Thus, our 
finding of increases in pinyon-juniper cover in the 1980s and 1990s, 
followed by declines since the 2000s may be representative of larger- 
scale processes – woodland expansion throughout the 20th century, 
followed by extensive tree mortality and conversion to non-forest ca. 
2000s to 2020. Indeed, 2003 was a year of abundant bark beetle activity 
on each landscape, where Ips spp. and other drought-mediated beetles 
caused tree mortality in 2.9 % and 10.7 % of Prescott and Tonto, 
respectively, with comparatively greater effects on pinyon-juniper sys­
tems (Hicke et al., 2020). 
4.3. Q3 – Drivers of conversion from forest to non-forest 
While our analyses broadly focused on transitions among land cover 
types, we were particularly interested in factors driving shifts from 
ponderosa pine-dominated cover (i.e., pine-oak, ponderosa pine, mixed 
conifer) towards non-forest. When such transitions occurred, wildfire 
and drought were the two primary drivers in our study area, which 
supports prior research in similar systems (e.g., Guiterman et al., 2022; 
Stevens et al., 2021; Woolman et al., 2022). Wildfire is the dominant 
terrestrial disturbance and plays a central role in the distribution of 
vegetation (Bowman et al., 2009; McLauchlan et al., 2020). Recent in­
creases in total area burned and high-severity fire have been noted 
throughout the Southwest, primarily due to increasing fuel aridity 
attributed to anthropogenic climate change (Abatzoglou and Williams, 
2016; Singleton et al., 2019). Nearly all coniferous tree species in our 
study area require seed dispersal from live trees to recolonize severely 
burned sites (Baker, 2009; Burns and Honkala, 1990; Rodman et al., 
2021c). Thus, severe fires have the potential to drive rapid and persis­
tent conversion from conifer forest towards alternative species assem­
blages or non-forest cover types in the MHE, particularly when patch 
sizes exceed typical seed dispersal distances (Coop et al., 2020; Guiter­
man et al., 2022). Fire affected large areas of each landscape in specific 
years (e.g., 2017 and 2019 on Prescott; 1990, 2002, and 2012 on Tonto), 
which led to notable declines in ponderosa pine-dominated forest cover 
in our study area. Still, many burned areas returned to forested cover 
types within 10 years, a recovery rate that was surprisingly rapid when 
compared to other dry conifer forests across the western US (Bright 
et al., 2019; Vanderhoof et al., 2020). Thus, while fire was active on each 
landscape and was a primary driver of transitions to non-forest, fire 
activity has not yet caused widespread forest losses within our study 
area. Instead, recently disturbed landscapes may be transitioning to­
wards younger forests, smaller tree sizes, and more open stands (i.e., 
structural changes), though these changes are difficult to evaluate using 
Landsat-derived maps of land cover. 
In unburned areas, drought events were a primary driver of transi­
tions from forest to non-forest cover. Specifically, 7.2 % of sites that 
experienced two short-interval drought events (i.e., negative FDSI in −2 
yr and 0 yr) transitioned to non-forest. Drought has critical influences on 
the structure and composition of forested ecosystems (Allen et al., 2010; 
Batllori et al., 2020), and can drive tree mortality by promoting stress (e. 
g., carbon starvation) and stem hydraulic failure (Choat et al., 2018). 
Our finding of compounded (sensu Paine et al., 1998) effects of two 
short-interval drought events is also supported by ecological theory and 
empirical research. When initial drought events do not cause tree mor­
tality, they can still leave trees vulnerable to future die-off events, bark 
beetles, or wildfire (Anderegg et al., 2015; van Mantgem et al., 2013). 
Indeed, years of preceding tree growth are strongly predictive of tree 
mortality during drought (Ogle et al., 2000; Slack et al., 2021), and 
many conifers in the southwestern US demonstrate reduced radial 
growth for five or more years following severe drought events, evidence 
of legacy effects (Peltier et al., 2016). Droughts are likely to increase in 
frequency and duration over the upcoming decades (Rodman et al., 
2020; Seager et al., 2013; Williams et al., 2012). Thus, short-interval 
drought events will play an increasingly important role in climate- 
driven forest transformations throughout the southwestern US. 
4.4. Study limitations and future research needs 
Precise identification of land cover types and local drivers of type 
conversion cannot be achieved with remote sensing alone and is 
impossible without field-based observations. For example, even at a 30- 
m resolution, many pixels in each study landscape had a mixture of 
multiple cover types (i.e., ‘mixed pixels’), contributing to error and 
uncertainty in cover type classifications. In addition, differentiating 
among spectrally similar land cover types in a biodiverse forest land­
scape is a distinct challenge when using a limited number of spectral 
bands (e.g., six in Landsat TM). Thus, while we improved mapping ac­
curacy by incorporating biophysical predictors, seasonal image com­
posites, and spatial and temporal segmentation, mapping error is an 
important limitation to inference in this study. Complementary analyses 
pairing remote sensing with tree ring reconstructions of mortality dates 
(e.g., DeRose et al., 2011), or repeated field inventories (e.g., Woolman 
et al., 2022) would prove fruitful in future research, helping to reduce 
methodological uncertainties and providing additional context for 
observed trends. While we identified wildfire and drought as key 
mechanisms driving conversions to non-forest cover, bark beetle activity 
and harvest also likely played a role in observed patterns. Unlike maps of 
fire severity, which were developed at a 30-m resolution consistent with 
land cover maps, data describing bark beetle activity and timber harvest 
were developed at a coarser spatial grain (1-km; bark beetle maps) or do 
not describe variation in harvest within the larger treatment units 
(FACTS treatment data). This scale mismatch between the response and 
predictors may have limited our ability to adequately capture the effects 
of bark beetle activity and harvest in analyses. Finally, though our an­
alyses spanned nearly 40 years, this period may still be insufficient to 
capture some ecological processes, such as lagged responses to climate 
(e.g., Svenning and Sandel, 2013) or post-fire forest recovery in slow- 
growing forests (Baker, 2018). 
4.5. Management implications

uncertainties surrounding future trends in climate, and the legacies of 
past land use and land cover change, land managers and practitioners in 
the Southwest US are presented with difficult challenges. Considering a 
variety of management approaches ranging from ‘no action’ to 
‘aggressive intervention’ facilitates learning and hedges bets to account 
for a range of potential future scenarios (Aplet and Cole, 2010; Millar 
et al., 2007); such diverse management approaches can target different 
locations on the landscape where they might be most appropriate (Aplet 
and Mckinley, 2017). These ideas comprise the core of the resist-accept- 
direct (RAD) framework, which helps to identify where management 
intervention is either impractical or unnecessary (‘accept’), and where 
management intervention is warranted to reduce the risk of trans­
formation (‘resist’) or facilitate transitions to better-adapted commu­
nities (‘direct’) (Lynch et al., 2021; Schuurman et al., 2022). Trailing- 
edge forests in the Southwest US, like many transitional ecosystems, 
are biodiversity hotspots (Araújo, 2002; Fleischner et al., 2017). Because 
of its substantial diversity and high vulnerability to climate-driven 
changes, the MHE is a region of critical management concern. Howev­
er, as the predicted mid-century climate is expected to deviate from the 
climatic niche of many forest ecosystems in the MHE (Parks et al., 2019), 
accepting or directing transitions to alternate species assemblages and 
community types may be the most appropriate management objectives 
in these areas. Indeed, transitions towards more drought-adapted 
vegetation communities are already underway due to the effects of 
fire, drought, and other disturbances. These new communities may still 
provide important ecosystem services and have high ecological resil­
ience (e.g., oak-dominated systems; Coop et al., 2016). 
Still, where current conditions in trailing edge forests provide critical 
ecosystem services (e.g., habitat for threatened or endangered species), 
management actions to resist change may also be appropriate strategies. 
The present study indicates that fire and drought are key drivers of 
transitions to non-forest cover, thus management interventions aimed at 
these factors may be particularly important to reducing risks of trans­
formation. Mechanical thinning and prescribed fire have the potential to 
reduce fire severity and spread under moderate fire weather conditions 
(Cansler et al., 2022; Kalies and Yocom Kent, 2016; but see Korb et al., 
2020). However, these effects rely on fires burning into treated areas 
during their period of efficacy, and, given limited resources for imple­
mentation, must be weighed against the costs of treating areas adjacent 
to homes and other economically important resources (Schoennagel 
et al., 2017). Similarly, future climatic conditions are predicted to in­
crease fire risk and extreme fire weather, which may test the efficacy of 
thinning and prescribed fire over upcoming decades (Braziunas et al., 
2020; Clarke et al., 2022; Loehman et al., 2018). Forest density and 
drought have interactive effects on tree physiological processes and 
mortality (Bradford et al., 2022; Tepley et al., 2020); therefore, where 
resisting drought-mediated ecosystem transformation is an important 
priority, active (i.e., thinning) or passive (i.e., drought-caused mortality) 
reductions in tree density may also help to promote resistance in re­
sidual trees. 
5. Conclusion 
Using annual maps of land cover derived from Landsat time series 
and extensive field data, we demonstrated that total forest cover in two 
trailing-edge landscapes was largely stable from 1985 to 2020. How­
ever, there were notable shifts among cover types, with ponderosa pine 
and mixed conifer forests transitioning towards pine-oak communities, 
and pinyon-juniper types converting to non-forest ca. 2000s to 2020. 
Where transitions from forest to non-forest cover did occur, wildfire and 
drought were the major drivers of change. In the Inter-Mountain West, 
35.8 % of the total forested area is currently considered ‘trailing edge’ 
and may deviate from the climate space required for forest persistence 
by ca. 2050 (Parks et al., 2019). Because these forests are highly 
vulnerable to climate change, they present unique and difficult chal­
lenges to land managers, but also provide an opportunity to explore the 
causes and consequences of recent climate-driven forest changes. 
Remotely sensed monitoring approaches, such as those used in the 
present study, provide a cost-effective and scalable method of quanti­
fying changes in trailing-edge forests and other forest ecosystems 
worldwide, which will help to inform decision making (Millar and Ste­
phenson, 2015). Such information is critical because forests provide 
critical ecosystem services to humans and other species (Costanza et al., 
2014, UN FAO, 2015).
