Abstract 
Wildland fire sizes in the American Southwest have increased over the last few decades 
creating challenges for managing public lands, including habitat for Mexican spotted owls (Strix 
occidentalis lucida, MSO). The US Forest Service (USFS) Region 3 defines MSO habitat as 
pine-oak (Pinus spp.-Quercus spp.), mixed-conifer or forest stands dominated by Douglas-fir 
(Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and white fir (Abies concolor (Gordon & Glend.) Lindl. 
Ex Hilderbr.). The US Fish and Wildlife Service (1995) listed the MSO as “threatened” in 1993 
prompting the USFS to identify Protected Activity Centers (PACs) and reduce high-severity 
wildland fires therein, which can endanger MSO habitat. Understanding the trends of high-
severity wildland fires in MSO habitat since the species was listed provides another tool for 
managers to protect limited habitat for this species. I overlaid spatial data layers of fire severity 
and vegetation with 387 PAC boundaries to assess patches of high-severity burned area of fires 
>405 ha from 1992 through 2011 on MSO PACs on the Four Forest Restoration Initiative 
landscape. I used Fragstats to acquire average-weighted mean area of high-severity burn patches 
within each fire boundary and for individual PACs. I analyzed forest types burned by high-
severity fire and assessed impacts to MSO habitat. High-severity burn patches in MSO PACs 
occur at higher rates in fires >4,047 ha than fires <4,047 ha. Wildland fires burned some portion 
of 180 PACs, 86% of which were affected by high-severity fire. Given trends in size of wildland 
fires and high-severity burn patches I recommend extensive treatments outside PACs, maximum 
allowable treatments inside PACs, and aggressive fire suppression efforts of fires ≥4,047 ha.

Introduction 
 
 
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) listed the Mexican spotted owl (Strix 
occidentalis lucida; hereafter MSO) as “threatened” in 1993 citing threats to its habitat by 
“destruction or modification” and “overutilization” (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 1995). In 
more recent years concerns focused on stand-replacing wildfire (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 
2013).  Though not mandated by law to adhere to the recovery plan, federal and state 
management agencies protect habitat of “threatened” or “endangered” species (USDI Fish and 
Wildlife Service 1995) by adopting FWS recommendations. The FWS First Revision of the 
MSO Recovery Plan (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012) outlines management actions for 
three types of habitat used by the MSO: Protected Activity Centers (PACs), Recovery Habitat, 
and Other Forest and Woodland Types. Of these, the most important and regulated areas are 
PACs, which occur in an uneven patchwork across the landscape; ecosystems at lower elevations 
include pinyon-juniper (Pinus spp., Juniperus spp.) and pine-oak (Pinus ponderosa, Quercus 
spp.), whereas forests at higher elevations are deciduous-evergreen (Ganey and Balda 1989, 
Ganey 2004, Ganey et al. 2011). Recommended minimum PAC size is 243 ha, although the 
Recovery Plan (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 1995) does allow smaller PAC sizes. MSO 
select habitat with multi-layered canopies with high percent cover (>40) for nest and roost sites 
but are not as restrictive when selecting foraging locations (Ganey et al. 1999) although owls 
tend to avoid managed (e.g., thinned, burned with prescribed fire) forests when unlogged stands 
are available (Ganey and Balda 1994). Set inside a PAC boundary, the core designates a 40 ha 
section encompassing known locations of nests or potential nesting habitat (USDI Fish and 
Wildlife Service 1995). The PACs, and to a greater extent the cores, are protected by and from 
management actions to minimize disturbance to MSOs during reproduction as the recovery plan 

Normandin 4 
 
suggests limiting management actions temporally and spatially (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
2012). The FWS requests that all actions except the monitoring of mating or reproduction take 
place during non-breeding times from September to March (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
2012).  
 
The MSO is genetically unique from the Northern (Strix occidentalis caurina) and 
California spotted owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) (Barrowclough et al. 1999) with MSO 
being the smallest of the three. However, the three species are morphologically similar standing 
43-48 cm tall with a wingspan of 100 cm (Sibley 2014) and weighing approximately 500-600g 
(Gutierrez et al. 1995) with the female larger than the male (Sibley 2014). The MSO is not 
considered a migrating species.  
 
The habitat range for MSO occurs from southern Utah and southwestern Colorado 
through Arizona and New Mexico, including parts of west Texas, reaching the southern range in 
the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre Oriental in Mexico (USDI Fish and Wildlife 
Service 2004). Within the U.S., habitat for the MSO is primarily on federal lands and is divided 
into landscape scale sections designated as Ecological Management Units (EMU) (U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service 2012). In Arizona, the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) manages most designated 
habitat as it falls within the boundaries of USFS National Forests.  
Select national forests are the focus of the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (hereafter 
4FRI) started the planning process to restore “priority forest landscapes” (Four Forest 
Restoration Initiative. 2011. Memorandum of Understanding. 
<http://4fri.org/pdfs/MOU_with_signatures.pdf> Accessed 11 Oct. 2014). Developed from the 
Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, 4FRI treatments propose thinning 
ponderosa pine stands to mitigate uncharacteristically large wildland fires and allowing for a safe 

Normandin 5 
 
return of fire to the ecosystem (Four Forest Restoration Initiative. 2011. Management 
Recommendations for Firescape 3 of the First Analysis Area. 
<http://4fri.org/pdfs/documents/collaboration/management_recommendations_firescape3.pdf> 
Accessed 11 Oct. 2014).  
 
MSO habitat exists scattered throughout the 4FRI landscape, primarily in pine-oak and 
mixed conifer stands, much of which evolved with low-intensity, frequent fire (Weaver 1951, 
Swetnam and Baisan 1996, Heinlein et al. 2005). Over a century of fire suppression and 
domestic livestock grazing allowed overstocking of small trees, which serve as ladder fuels 
(Moore et al. 1999, Fulé and Laughlin 2007) has led to the need for restoration of these forests as 
FWS cites concerns for high-severity fire endangering MSO habitat (U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service 2012). Heinlein et al. (2005) documented such an increase in density in mixed-conifer 
forest in northern Arizona from 52 trees per hectare prior to fire suppression to over 1,606 trees 
per hectare. These conditions can facilitate the advancement of wildfire from the forest floor into 
the canopy endangering the vital structure of MSO habitat, especially if it burns at high-severity 
potentially leaving little more than dead trees and downed logs in an early seral stage forest 
(Brown et al. 2004). Fires across the western U.S. are starting earlier in the fire season 
(Westerling et al. 2006), which may be enhanced by projected increased temperatures and 
decreased moisture (Williams et al. 2010). Dennison et al. (2014) demonstrate trends of 
increasing number of fires per year and increasing fire size for the mountains of Arizona and 
New Mexico.  
 
Management actions to mitigate high-severity fires often include removal of ladder fuels 
while creating openings in the forest canopy. These treatment objectives may be in direct conflict 
with habitat selection by owls (see Ganey et al. 1999 and Ganey et al. 2003). Owls select 

Normandin 6 
 
roosting sites in closed canopy forests, possibly to avoid high daytime temperatures (Ganey and 
Balda 1989) and often select unmanaged forests instead of thinned stands (Ganey and Balda 
1994). Recommendations from the Recovery Plan (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012) allow 
≤20% of an EMU to be treated and suggest treatments in other forest and woodland types outside 
of PACs first to provide a buffer for PACs and recovery habitat. Guidelines stipulate PACs 
(outside the 40 ha core) can be treated and all thinning activities must be scheduled during the 
non-breeding season unless a determination has been made that resident owls are not breeding in 
a given year (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012).  
 
Over the last few decades, published literature on spotted owls shows broader 
understanding of sub-species genetic variation (Barrowclough et al. 1999), temperature 
sensitivity (Ganey et al. 1993), call identification and use (Ganey 1990), and home range and 
habitat use (Ganey and Balda 1989, Ganey et al. 1999, Ward and Salas 2000, May and Gutierrez 
2002, Ganey 2004). Although Bond et al. (2009) illuminated habitat use by California spotted 
owls in post-fire forests, little information exists in the published literature summarizing effects 
of wildland fire on MSO habitat (see Bond et al. 2002). Four years post-fire, California spotted 
owls used habitat with all burn severities; foraging activities included use of high-severity burn 
areas, which contained high levels of understory growth thought to benefit prey species and 
roosting in low severity burn areas that maintained higher live basal area and higher canopy 
cover percent than other moderate- or high-severity burned areas (Bond et al. 2009). Here, I 
provide an analysis of the extent of high-severity wildland fire in MSO habitat with the 
following objectives: 1) analyze trends of large wildland fire (>405 ha) from 1992 to 2011 in 
MSO habitat within the boundary of 4FRI in Arizona 2) quantify high-severity burn area using 
average-weighted mean area of high-severity burn patches for individual PACs in 4FRI MSO 

Normandin 7 
 
habitat from 1992 to 2011. Biologists may use this information coupled with owl populations to 
determine specific thresholds for tolerance of high-severity fire patches within MSO PACs. 
Planning for 4FRI is ongoing which may allow land managers to incorporate these results in 
treatments. 
 
Methods 
 
The study area for this project was the 4FRI landscape in Arizona, U.S.A. (Figure 1). The 
scope of the 4FRI collaborative restoration effort is 971,246 ha including all or part of the 
Coconino, Kaibab, Tonto, and Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests. Inside the 4FRI boundary the 
USFS identified 25 different categories of vegetation, which in total are dominated by ponderosa 
pine followed by stands of pine-oak. Higher elevations support stands of aspen (Populus 
tremuloides Michx.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), white fir (Abies 
concolor (Gordon & Glend.) Lindl. Ex Hilderbr.), and white pine (Pinus strobiformis Engelm.). 
At lower elevations pinyon-juniper stands prevail interspersed with grassland. Precipitation 
patterns for the area are bimodal with approximately 50% by winter snowfall and 50% by 
summer monsoon storms with annual mean precipitation approximately 50 cm. At the northern 
end of the 4FRI boundary Williams has an annual mean maximum temperature of 18°C and 
mean minimum temperature of 3°C. In the middle of the study area, Heber has an annual mean 
maximum temperature of 18°C and minimum mean temperature of 2.5°C. At the southeastern 
end of the 4FRI boundary Alpine has an annual mean maximum temperature of 17°C and a mean 
minimum temperature of -3.5°C (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 2014.

Flagstaff is the most populated city in the 4FRI area with the 2010 census recording 
>65,000 residents (City of Flagstaff. 2014. <http://www.flagstaff.az.gov/index.aspx?NID=1095> 
Accessed 21 Oct. 2014) with many smaller municipalities interspersed in the study area. The 
presence of so many human establishments creates wildland-urban interfaces and increases 
potential human-wildfire interaction and enhances the need for forest treatments. 
 
GIS Procedures 
 
I summarized the impact of wildfire on MSO PACs in the 4FRI area for a period 
encompassing two decades (1992 to 2011) corresponding with the time frame the MSO was 
listed as “threatened” using ArcMap (version 10.2.1.3497, ESRI 2013). Specifically, this study 
considered the intersection of MSO PACs and forest fires ≥ 405 ha (at the time of data 
acquisition, comprehensive data layers were only available for fires ≥405 ha from Monitoring 
Trends and Burn Severity website (www.MTBS.gov)) within the 4FRI boundary. 
I downloaded data layers for wildland fires ≥405 ha from MTBS.gov (MTBS Data Search and 
Distribution Tools. 2014. <http://www.mtbs.gov/data/customquery.html> Accessed 1 Feb. 2014) 
using the following criteria: years 1992 to 2011 (2011 was the most recent year all fires are 
represented on MTBS.gov), spatial = Arizona, size ≥ 1,000 acres (405 ha), administrative 
ownership= Forest Service, type = all, assessment type = both, and data version = both. Analysts 
create MTBS GIS layers by comparing pre- and post-fire satellite imagery, defining fire area by 
the “multi-spectral difference” between the images (Miller and Thode 2007). The USFS Region 
3 office provided the GIS data layer for MSO PACs for all of Region 3 (C. Bogart, GIS and 
Photogrammetry Unit Leader, USFS, Southwestern Region, personal comm. 31 Jan 2014). I 
compiled fire layers on a map showing MSO PACs within the 4FRI boundary. Fires that burned 

Normandin 9 
 
any part of a PAC (any intersection ≥1 pixel overlap of fire layer and PAC layer) contributed to 
the analysis. Due to influences of multiple fires overlapping individual PACs, I separated the 
fires into four groups (Table 1) so that any PAC would show an effect from only one fire in each 
fire group. For each fire group, I merged all fire boundaries onto one data layer then used the clip 
function in ARCMap to intersect the PACs layer with the merged layer of each of the four fire 
groups. This produced patches of burned area in individual, affected PACs from individual fires 
within each of the four fire groups. After clipping the PACs layer by each fire group layer, I 
recalculated areas of the PAC polygons to acquire area affected by each fire for any PAC burned. 
Downloaded data from MTBS.gov included raster layers delineating pre-classified burn severity 
areas for each fire. For the four fire groups, I used the mosaic-to-new-raster feature in ArcMap to 
compile rasters for each group of fires then converted these to polygons and extracted the high-
severity data for each group. Once high-severity burn data were acquired for each PAC, I used 
the clip function in ARCMap on the mid-level vegetation layer with this data to assess which 
vegetation types burned at high-severity. Areas burned by low and moderate-severity were not 
assessed due to the specific concern for high-severity fire by FWS (U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service 2012). 
  
I used the “class” category to evaluate high-severity pixels identified as class 4 in MTBS 
rasters converted to image files at 600 dots per inch. I put image files for 57 fires into Fragstats 
4.2 (McGarigal et al. 2012) to acquire an average-weighted mean area for patches of high-
severity burns within individual PACs and an average-weighted mean area for high-severity burn 
patches within entire individual fire boundaries.

Analysis 
 
To identify trends in wildland fire I calculated high-severity burn area within PACs and 
then standardized by percent of PAC area, since each PAC size is unique. I used a Kruskal-
Wallis non-parametric test (Breslow 1970) to test for differences between fire size classes with 
respect to percentage of high-severity burned area within PACs. Following statistically 
significant results (P<0.05), I used Mann-Whitney tests (DeLong et al. 1988) to make pairwise 
comparisons between fire size classes. Alpha levels for pairwise tests were adjusted using a 
Bonferroni correction (α < 0.05/10 = 0.005). Tests were conducted using SAS JMP PRO 
(version 10, SAS International Inc. 2012). I used a two by two contingency table (Table 2) to 
compare fire size and occurrence of high-severity fire within any PAC to assess probability for 
high-severity fire occurring in PACS within fires >4,047 ha. 
 
Results 
 
GIS data layers revealed 387 MSO PACs inside the 4FRI boundaries delineating 101,380 
ha of total PAC area with average PAC size of 259 ha. Wildland fires ≥405 ha from years 1992 
to 2011 affected 180 of 387 PACs (46%) (Table 3). Fires affected 38 PACs (10%) multiple times 
and four different fires affected one PAC. 
 
I obtained data for 278 fires in National Forests in Arizona; 124 of those burned at least 
partially inside the 4FRI boundary. Fifty seven fires (20%) burned some portion of at least one 
MSO PAC, and one fire (2011 Wallow Fire) burned within 72 PACs. Forty one fires showed 
high-severity burn patches in at least one PAC. Five years (1992, 1993, 1997, 1998, and 2001) 
did not have fires ≥405 ha that affected any MSO PAC (Figure 2). All five of the years that did 
not affect PACs were in the first half the 20-year period (1992-2001), while fire burned through 

Normandin 11 
 
some portion of a PAC in all of the last 10 years of this study. Fires per year showed an 
increasing trend as well as demonstrating recurrence of fires >150,000 ha (Figure 3). A trend of 
increased burned area on the 4FRI landscape developed in 2002 and continued through 2011, 
with obvious surges in hectares burned due to the Rodeo Fire in 2002 and the Wallow Fire in 
2011. Years analyzed produced a range of annual total burned area from 7,553 to 234,420 ha 
with a cumulative total of 586,488 ha. Cumulative high-severity burn in PAC area increased 
dramatically in individual years; in two separate fire years cumulative totals doubled (Pumpkin 
Fire in 2000, Wallow Fire in 2011) and in one fire year the cumulative total quadrupled (Rodeo 
Fire in 2002 a.k.a. Rodeo-Chediski Fire) (Figure 4). Fire at all severity levels in the 20-year span 
burned 43,977 ha of PAC territory (43% of total PAC area), of which 8,402 ha (19%) burned at 
high-severity.  
 
From 1992 to 2011, 9,345 ha of 48,776 ha (19%) designated PAC area in Coconino 
National Forest burned (all burn-severity types). In the portion of the Tonto National Forest 
inside the 4FRI boundary 5,326 ha of 13,749 ha (39%) of all PAC area burned. Fires burned 
through 847 ha of 1,432 ha (59%) of all PAC area within the portion of the Kaibab National 
Forest inside the 4FRI boundary and through 28,460 ha of 37,398 ha (76%) of all PAC area in 
the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests. PAC area burned at high-severity at the following 
percentages in each national forest: Coconino 1,207 ha of 48,776 ha (2%), Tonto 1,077 ha of 
13,749 ha (8%), Kaibab 308 ha of 1,432 ha (22%), and the Apache-Sitgreaves 5,811 ha of 
37,398 ha (16%).  
 
Average-weighted means for area of high-severity burn patches in individual fires ranged 
from 0.04 ha (Lost Eden Fire) to 896 ha (Rodeo Fire). Average-weighted means for area of high-
severity burn patches in all PACs from any one fire ranged from 0.04 ha (Reno Fire) to 83.6 ha 

Normandin 12 
 
(Pumpkin Fire). Average-weighted means for area of high-severity burn patches for individual 
PACs from any one fire ranged from <0.1 ha (PAC SPOW030101022 from the Reno Fire) to 
93.9 ha (PAC SPOW030105004 from the Rodeo Fire). Although no individual PAC experienced 
high-severity burn for 100% of the PAC area, 18 PACs had >50% area burned at high-severity. 
Analysis of average-weighted mean area of high-severity patch sizes within PACs shows patch 
sizes to be significantly larger in fires >8,094 ha. 
 
Within affected PACs in the 4FRI boundary, 57% of all vegetation area was designated 
as ponderosa pine or ponderosa pine-mix. The aspen-evergreen-tree-mix accounted for 7% and 
upper-evergreen-forest-tree-mix vegetation type accounted for 6% of all area. The remaining 22 
vegetation types each accounted for 3% or less of the total area within affected PACs. Post-burn, 
ponderosa pine vegetation type comprised 46% of all 4FRI PAC area burned by high-severity 
fire. Of all PAC hectares burned by high-severity fire, other vegetation types in the 4FRI area 
affected are aspen-evergreen-tree-mix at 17%, grass-forb-mix at 10%, upper-evergreen-forest-
tree-mix at 5%, white fir at 4%, and upper-deciduous-evergreen-forest-tree-mix at 4%. The 
remaining 19 vegetation categories combined for the balance of 13% of the high-severity burned 
area, each accounting for <4% of the total burned area. 
 
Since the MSO was listed as “threatened” fires <4,047 ha accounted for 111 of 124 fires 
that burned into a PAC in the 4FRI area. Fires <4,047 ha contributed <17% of high-severity 
burned area within PACs over the 20 years analyzed, whereas fires >4,047 ha accounted for 
>83% of high-severity burned areas within PACs in the study area.

Discussion  
 
One of two criteria proposed by the FWS to delist the MSO by the year 2022 stipulates 
owl nesting and roosting habitat must be stable or improving for 10 years based on habitat 
variables presented in the recovery plan. Desired conditions for MSO habitat include minimum 
canopy cover in pine-oak of 40% and mixed-conifer of 60% with small canopy openings (0.04 to 
1 ha) in nest/roost sites (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012). Although current conditions of 
most PACs meet those parameters, given the potential for stand-replacing fire within PACs, 
meeting proposed canopy cover percentages after treatments may be extremely difficult while 
maintaining viable MSO habitat. Although Bond et al. (2002) suggest MSO may have evolved 
with western forests and may be able to adjust to the effects of wildland fires in the short-term, 
the selection of unmanaged forests by the MSO (Ganey and Balda 1994) calls into question the 
amount of area to treat and what level of fuel and canopy cover to remove.  
 
The Recovery Plan (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012) guidelines on fire management 
acknowledges that prescribed and wildland fire use outside of PACs will be necessary to allow 
low- to moderate-severity fire to reduce fuels mitigating high-severity fires. Mechanical thinning 
concentrated outside of PAC areas may be required prior to returning fire to the landscape with 
projections for 4FRI treatments set at 121,406 ha over 10 years (Four Forest Restoration 
Initiative. Proposed Action for Four Forest Restoration Initiative. 2011. 
<http://4fri.org/documents.html> Accessed 15 Oct. 2014). The continued threat of large wildland 
fires exists (Agee and Skinner 2005, Fulé et al. 2007, Prather et al. 2008) until managers initiate 
4FRI prescriptions or other treatments. The increase of annual total PAC area burned by high-
severity fire (Figure 2) coupled with a decrease in percent of high-severity burned hectares in 
PACs relative to all hectares burned (Figure 5) indicates that annual burned forest area continues 

Normandin 14 
 
to increase in this study area. These larger fires require that finite, suppression resources protect 
higher value assets such as communities and residential structures in Wildland Urban Interface 
areas, drawing resources away from MSO habitat. Even smaller fires challenge fire managers to 
allot limited resources. Although habitat for “threatened” and “endangered” species is a 
consideration for incident commanders, safety of firefighters and the public is paramount 
followed by protection of property (B. Greco, Director of Outreach, Ecological Restoration 
Institute, personal comm. 17 April 2014).  
 
Cumulative totals of all severity (Figure 4) and high-severity burned (Figure 6) area in 
PACs show a trend for doubling of burned hectares in individual fire years. In 2000, due to 
substantial burning of five PACs, the Pumpkin Fire doubled the total PAC hectares burned by 
high-severity fire in the previous eight fire years. This trend increased during 2002, when the 
Rodeo-Chedeski Fire quadrupled the PAC area burned at high-severity, in only 15 PACs, 
totaling 3,537 ha burned. Prather et al. (2008) stated 55 PACs were affected by the Rodeo-
Chedeski Fire. Any PACs previously designated in the 4FRI area and now decommissioned 
could have elevated these totals. The 2011 fire year almost doubled the cumulative high-severity 
burn area making the final total for this study 8,393 ha burned by high-severity fire, representing 
>8% of all area designated as MSO habitat in PACs. Projected into the future following the 
demonstrated pattern from 1992 to 2011, total burned area at any severity could see above 86% 
of all designated PAC area affected by fire by the year 2031. Extending the pattern forward for 
high-severity burns results in 16% of PAC area lost. Including additional burned PAC area lost 
and unaccounted for in this study from the Rodeo-Chedeski Fire, total projected PAC area 
burned could easily exceed the total area currently designated as PACs. There is no way to 

Normandin 15 
 
definitively predict PAC area loss due to high-severity fire; however, continued loss of PAC area 
forces greater reliance on recovery habitat and other woodland and forest types.  
 
Average-weighted mean area of high-severity burn patches (Appendix A) varied 
throughout the range of fire sizes. The average-weighted mean area of patch sizes within PACs 
demonstrate a pattern when sorted by fire size (Figure 7) showing a definitive increase for fires 
>8,094 ha. Identifying specific levels of habitat destruction may be correlated with occupancy 
rates to illuminate post-fire MSO habitat selection.  
 
These results are based on the returns from searches and subsequent data layers from the 
MTBS website. Any fires not recorded or returned from the search would not be included in this 
analysis. Uncertainty exists in the mapping of fire boundaries either by satellite or on the ground; 
irregular burn patterns of wildland fire accentuate this uncertainty. Due to these uncertainties, 
inconsistencies may exist in mapping high-severity burns for individual fires. In addition, effects 
of moderate-severity fires may be underestimated creating an increased impact to MSO habitat 
not accounted for in this work. Regardless of the date a PAC was designated or fire occurrence 
during the study period, I assumed that area designated as a PAC has represented MSO habitat 
throughout the 20-year period analyzed. 
 
I caution in definitively extrapolating from this assessment as fires <405 ha were not 
included and would certainly affect total hectares and may affect percentages burned in similar 
analysis. Hypothetically, a high-severity fire as small as 40 ha in a PAC core could cause enough 
damage to nesting sites to render that PAC unsuitable for owl reproduction for years. This study 
did not include analysis of nesting or cores areas within any PAC. Additionally, I assumed PACs 
represented MSO habitat throughout the entire study period without consideration of actions 
possibly taken by USFWS and USFS to address environmental changes or newly acquired 

Normandin 16 
 
biologic information pertinent to MSO and its habitat. Biologists on two national forests 
involved with 4FRI acknowledged adjustments to PAC boundaries to address habitat loss and 
new information on specific owls (C. Thompson, Wildlife Biologist, Coconino National Forest, 
personal comm. 8 April 2014, and J. Wilcox Wildlife Biologist, Tonto National Forest, personal 
comm. 14 April 2014). Therefore, managerial adjustments to PACs over the entire MSO range 
might be expected. 
 
Management implications 
 
Given the trends of increasing number of fires per year and increasing size of fires shown 
by Dennison et al. (2014), without intervention wildland fires in the 4FRI area are expected to 
increase in size; forest treatments will be pivotal in securing MSO habitat by mitigating 
uncharacteristically large wildland fires. Throughout the area bounded by 4FRI, treatment efforts 
should carry on at the projected or an increased rate in all areas designated other woodland and 
forest types as well as recovery habitat reducing the possibility of wildland fire burning into 
adjacent PACs. Thinning treatments inside PACs should continue up to the maximum allowable 
area provided by the recovery plan (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012) and further research on 
the tolerance of MSO to disturbance by high-severity wildland fire in both the short and long-
terms is needed. In spite of recognizing the dangers of fires >4,047 ha, one of the greatest 
challenges will be to provide adequate resources to assist fire managers to quell wildland fires 
before exceeding that size and likely losing more designated MSO habitat.

Figure 4. Cumulative Protected Activity Center (PAC) area burned at all burn severities. After 
the 2002 fire year, the total PAC area burned almost doubled (4,948 to 9,812 ha). In the years 
2003 to 2011, cumulative hectares burned in PACs by all burn severities more than quadrupled 
to 43,922 ha with the spike in 2011 from the Wallow Fire.

coupled with the increase of PAC area burned in the same time period (figure 2) indicates fires 
are getting larger.

Figure 6. Mexican spotted owl Protected Activity Center (PAC) area burned by high-severity 
fire. The trend illustrates a series of years increasing the number of high-severity burned hectares 
in PACs by a factor of two, three or four. Fire year 2000 doubled high-severity burned area from 
the previous 9 years (312 to 867 ha). Fire year 2002 quadrupled cumulative totals from previous 
years of this study. In 2011, the Wallow Fire again almost doubled the cumulative PAC area 
burned at high-severity from 4,564 ha to 8,394 ha.

Figure 7. Average-weighted mean (AMU) by fire size. Using high-severity burn patch sizes from 
Fragstats, patch sizes for each Protected Activity Center (PAC) affected within individual fires 
were grouped by overall fire size. The elevated average for the largest fire-size group represents 
larger patch sizes in burned PACs affected by several of the largest of wildland fires. Graph 
shows AMU mean with SE bars.
