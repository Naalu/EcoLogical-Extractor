Old-Growth Descriptions for the Major Forest Cover Types 
in the Rocky Mountain Region1 
Mel S. Meh!2 
Abstract.-Old-growth descriptions have been developed for each of the 
major forest cover types in the Rocky Mountain Region of the Forest Service. 
Included with each description is aminimum list of tree and stand variables 
that characterize old growth. Additional attributes are listed that affect the 
quality of old growth. These descriptions will be used to locate, map , and 
inventory old-growth forests for forest planning. 
INTRODUCTION 
This document describes the old-growth forest 
conditions for the major forest cover types in the 
Rocky Mountain Region (Region 2) of the Forest 
Service. Region 2 covers the states of Colorado, 
Wyoming, South Dakota, Kansas and Nebraska. 
These old-growth descriptions are not precise 
definitions. There is a certain amount of subjec­
tivity in defining old growth. Old growth is con­
ceptual and difficult to define precisely. For that 
reason the term "description" was chosen instead 
of "definition." They describe the ecologically 
important structural features of old-growth forest 
ecosystems. They include a list of attributes 
measurable from stand-level inventories that 
characterize old-growth ecosystems. There are 
intangible elements, various functions and inter­
actions occurring in old-growth ecosystems and 
the composition of the understory vegetation that 
are not part of these descriptions. 
The following descriptions are the first attempt 
to describe old growth structurally by major 
forest cover type for Region 2. They form the 
collective knowledge of what is thought to de­
scribe old growth. These descriptions Will be 
dynamic and will be modified as we learn more 
about the dynamics of old-growth ecosystems and 
its need and influence on the landscape. 
Descriptions have been developed for the 
Engelmann spruce/subalpine fir,Douglas-fir, 
lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, aspen and pin­
yon-juniper forest cover types. Ponderosa pine 
grows in 3 distinct topographical areas in Region 
2: the Black Hills, front range of the Rocky Moun­
tains, and southwest Colorado, each with differ­
ent stand characteristics. Separate old-growth 
descriptions have been developed for each area.

The forest cover types are defined in the Soci­
ety of American Foresters (SAF) handbook Forest 
Cover Types of the United State and Canada, 
1980. These cover types are those by which most 
inventory and management is done. Descriptions 
for the minor forest types such as limber pine or 
white pine will be added in the future. 
These descriptions and associated attributes 
will be used to map and inventory old growth in 
the Region for Forest planning. They are general. 
For project level work detailed site specific analy­
ses may be needed. 
The descriptions follow a format developed by 
the National Old-Growth Task Group. 
Description 
Old-growth forests are unique ecosystems that 
are an important component of biological diver­
sity. Old growth occurs at some point in the later 
stages of the development of a stand (fig. 1). 
A stand that has reached an old-growth condi­
tion has developed a diversity of functions and 
interactions that did not exist in earlier stages. 
The later stages of development also differ from 
earlier stages by structure such as tree size, 
standing and down dead trees, number of canopy 
levels, age and the composition of the understory 
species. 
The age at which old growth develops and the 
structural attributes that characterize old growth 
will vary by forest cover type, climate, site condi­
tions and past disturbances. However, old growth 
is typically distinguished from younger growth by 
several of the following stand attributes: 
-large trees for species and site. 
- variation in tree sizes and spacing. 
- standing and down dead trees. 
- decadence in the form of broken or deformed 
tops or bole and root decay. 
- multiple canopy layers. 
- gaps in the tree canopy and understory 
patchiness. .

A stand may contain some trees that meet the 
criteria for old growth but the stand as a whole could 
lack the functions and interactions ofan old-growth 
ecosystem and would not be considered old 
growth. 
' 
Old growth encompasses both older forests 
dominated by fire-dependent species and forests 
dominated by shade tolerant species. Different 
stages or qualities of old growth will be recogniz­
able in many forest cover types. Sporadic, low to 
moderate severity disturbances are an integral 
part of the internal dynamics of many old-growth 
ecosystems. Canopy openings resulting from the 
death of overstory trees often give rise to patches 
of sm a11 trees, shrubs, and herbs in the under­
story. Frequent, low intensity fires are important 
for some species to maintain their dominance on 
a site. 
Old growth is not necessarily "virgin" or "pri­
meval". It could develop following human distur­
bances. It could also develop from man's indirect 
influence on the landscape by the control of fire. 
Attributes 
There are many attributes that could be used 
to characterize old growth, but these descriptions 
use attributes that are tree and stand-level 
characteristics such as diameter, canopy layers or 
patchiness. While there maybe some attributes 
that seem applicable to a11 cover types, there is 
not one universal set of attributes that can 
adequately describe old growth for a11 cover 
types. 
Each Region, as directed by the National Old­
Growth Task Group, was to use a basic set of 
attributes to describe old growth. These are 
referred to as the "standard" attributes. Where 
necessary each Region had the option to include 
"addition a l" attributes to more fully describe old 
growth. In combination they provide the mini­
mum requirements for determining if a stand is 
old growth. 
A special set of attributes called "quality 
attributes" have been added. These are items 
that further enhance the v;:Jlue of an old-g 
stand once it has been determined to be 01 
growth based on the above minimums. Th

Old growth may have evidence of past t 
ment including stumps, slash, down logs, 
fences and other improvements. However, 
may affect the quality of old growth. 
Development of Descriptions 
During the summer of 1990, workshops 
held in various locations throughout the F 
(fig 2). 
The purpose was to visit old-growth sitE 
discuss the tree and stand related attribu 
could describe these old-growth sites. Att€ 
at the workshops included District, Forest 
Regional staff and scientists from the Roc 
Mountain Research Station. Each worksh 
focused on a specific forest cover type. Fro 
workshops a list of tree and stand attribU 
each forest cover type was developed desc: 
of old growth. The description and list of I': 
tributes for the pinyon-juniper cover type 
adapted from Region 3.

The descriptions and lists were then sent out 
for review and comments to additional Regional 
arid Rocky Mountain Station staff and interested 
publics. 
SPRUCE-FIR - SAF COVER TYPE 206 
Narrative 
Engelmann spruce (Pica engelmannii) and 
subalpine fir (A bies lasiocarpa) comprise the 
spruce/fir forest cover type in the subalpine zone 
in the Rocky Mountain Region. Spruce-fir occu­
pies the highest and coldest forest area in the 
Region and is generally found from 9,000 to 
11 ,000 feet but may grow as low as 8,000 feet 
and as high as 12,000 feet or timberline. 
Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir are ex­
tremely shade tolerant compared to the other 
major forest species. By being shade tolerant they 
can reproduce under themselves and barring any 
major disturbance, perpetuate the stand. Subal­
pine fir is more shade tolerant than Engelmann 
spruce and may reproduce vegetatively by layer­
ing. In younger stands subalpine fir may be the 
major component of the forest type. However, it is 
shorter lived than Engelmann spruce. Conse­

quired for old growth, but provide for higher quality old growth if present. Any of the "must" 
criteria in excess of the minimums could also indicate a higher quality of old growth.

story may still have an abundance subalpine fir 
due to it's high tolerance to shade and vegetative 
layering. Engelmann spruce life span averages 
350 to 400 years with 500-year-old or more trees 
not uncommon. Trees over 250 years are not 
uncommon for subalpine fir but most are 150 to 
200 years old. It is quite susceptible to heart rot 
and generally dies at an earlier age than En­
gelmann spruce. 
Spruce-fir is climax in the range that it occu­
pies . No other tree species will replace it. The 
only time the stand would be replaced by another 
species is when a major disturbance like fire 
would occur, opening up the stand to sunlight. 
Less shade tolerant species then could occupy the 
site. Over time, up to300 years or so, the more 
shade tolerant Engelmann spruce and subalpine 
fir would re-dominate the site. 
After a stand replacingevent such as fire or 
clear felling, lodgepole pine or aspen will be the 
replacing species at the lower elevational range of 
spruce-fir. If there is a sufficient seed source, 
spruce-fir will begin to develop in the understory 
and the lodgepole will begin to break apart with 
the stand reverting back to spruce-fir. Where 
there is not a sufficient spruce-fir seed source the 
stand will remain in lodgepole pine or aspen. 
When at climax the stands are usually quite 
stable and will remain on the site indefinitely 
until replaced because of fire, logging, insect, 
disease, windstorm or other major disturbance. 
Description 
Spruce-fir old-growth stands are at climax and 
generally have a high number of large, old trees 
with an understory of shrubs and small subalpine 
firs. The percentage of canopy closure can vary. 
There is usually a considerable amount of stand-

ing dead and down trees making it quite difficult 
at times to walk through the stand (fig. 3). 
There can be lichens hanging from the tree 
branches and on the stems of the trees. It usually 
contains a mixture of different tree sizes provid­
. ing a variety of structure within the stand. The 
upper canopy would consist of a cohort of older 
trees that are slow growing. These older trees can 
be characterized as having dead or broken tops, 
having flattened and open crowns, containing rot 
and possibly having bark that is reddish in color. 
Other tree species could be present such as 
lodgepole pine or aspen but generally would be 
scattered within the stand and at the lower 
elevations.

INTERIOR DOUGLAS-FIR­ 
SAF COVER TYPE 210  
Narrative 
The interior Douglas-fir tPseudotsuga menziesii 
var. glauca) cover type occurs throughout Region 
109 

2 from 6,000 to 10,000 feet in elevation. It occurs 
Description 
as pure stands or in association with other spe­
cies such as Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir 
at higher elevations to lodgepole pine and aspen 
at its mid-elevational range and to ponderosa 
pine in its lower elevational range. In southwest 
Colorado, it grows with white fir and ponderosa 
pine were-it is also referred to as mixed conifer. 
Interior Douglas-fir is much different than the 
coastal variety of the Pacific Northwest. It grows 
in a drier climate and does not attain the growth, 
size or age of the Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga 
menziesii var. men.ziesii) of the Pacific coast. 
Douglas-fir is more shade tolerant than pine 
and aspen but less tolerant than Engelmann 
spruce or subalpine fir. When growing in associa­
tion with spruce-fir it will be seral giving way 
eventually to the more shade tolerant spruce-fir. 
When growing in association with ponderosa 
pine, lodgepole pine or aspen it often dominates 
these species becoming the climax species if 
succession is not interrupted by a major distur­
bance such as fire. 
Since Douglas-fir is shade tolerant, it can 
reproduce under its own canopy. This results in 
old stands of pure Douglas-fir that tend to be 
uneven-aged rather than single-aged. These pure 
stands most likely originated from fire. They 
remain over time because of Douglas-fir's ability 
to survive successive fires due to rapid growth, 
thick corky bark, ability to form adventitious 
roots and the longer fire interval on cool and 
moist north facing slopes. These stands generally 
reach a maximum age of 400 years old although 
some have reached an age of 700 years. 
Where Douglas-fir grows in pure stands, it is 
usually on cooler and damper north facing slopes. 
Along the front range of Colorado, these stands 
have been heavily damaged by a spruce budworrn 
infestation that began in the mid 1980's. 
Insects often modify the structure of older 
Douglas-fir stands, creating large gaps or patches 
and groups of dead trees. This produces a patchy 
stand of large trees with Douglas-fir seedlings 
and saplings growing in the gaps giving the stand 
more vertical structure and an uneven aged 
composition. 
At its lower elevational range, it has been 
easily accessible and influenced by post settle­
ment activities. It has been heavily utilized for 
mining timbers and lumber and for recreation. 
Consequently few stands of old-growth Douglas­
fir exist at lower elevations. However, its area is 
increasing-in the lower elevations as it is replac­
ing ponderosa pine especially on the cooler more 
moist north facing slopes. The frequent low 
intensity fires that kept Douglas-fir from becom­
ing established in the ponderosa pine type have 
been reduced, allowing Douglas-fir to become 
established under the ponderosa pine. 
An old-growth Douglas-fir stand would consist 
of an overstory of trees that are predominately or 
entirely Douglas-fir. On the cooler, more moist, 
north facing slopes it may be growing in associa­
tion with spruce-fir or white fir. On "dri er sites " 
old-growth Douglas-fir could be associated with 
ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine and aspen. Where 
the site is dry, the stand would be more open­
grown compared to a cooler, more moist site .such 
as a north facing slope or drainage bottom. Some 
dead standing trees and down dead trees would 
be present. Some of the overstory trees would 
have large and open branched, flattened or dead 
tops and contain some rot.

growth.

LODGEPOLE PINE - SAF COVER TYPE 218 
Narrative 
The lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. 
latifolia) cover type in Region 2 consists of exten­
sive stands of pure lodgepole pine or, to a lesser 
extent, stands in association with other species 
such as Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, or 
aspen. It occurs between 7,500 feet and 11,500 
110 

feet elevation but reaches maximum development 
in the upper montane and lower subalpine zones 
on south and west facing slopes between 9,000 
and 10,000 feet elevation. 
In contrast to the shade tolerant Engelmann
spruce and subalpine fir, lodgepole pine is shade 
intolerant and is an aggressive pioneer develop­
ing on sites recently opened up due to fire, insects 
and disease, windstorms, clearcutting or other 
major stand removing disturbance. Lodgepole
pine stands that are 350 to 400 years old exist 
but they are uncommon. The average life span of 
lodgepole pine is probably closer to 250 years or 
less because of the frequency of stand replacing 
disturbances such as fire. Fires are more frequent 
in lodgepole pine than spruce-fir as they occur in 
a warmer and dryer environment. 
Lodgepole pine is generally considered a seral 
species. That is, it will be replaced by the more 
shade tolerant Engelmann spruce and subalpine 
fir. Most lodgepole pine stands become estab­
lished after stand replacing events such as fire. 
As the lodgepole pine matures Engelmann spruce 
and subalpine fir will appear as the understory 
eventuaily replacing the overstory lodgepole pine. 
The stand will remain as spruce-fir until another 
stand replacing event occurs. 
There are instances when lodgepole pine can 
be considered climax. In areas where a seed 
source of more shade tolerant trees species does 
not exist or the site is marginal for other tree 
species, the lodgepole pine stand will not be 
replaced. If there is a stand replacing occurrence 
like fire the stand will re-seed with lodgepole 
pine. If not disturbed the stand will begin to 
develop gaps in the tree canopy as trees die. 
These gaps will allow sunlight to reach seedlings, 
renewing the stand but a stand with.a more 
varied structure. Over successive generations the 
stand would develop a structure more consistent 
of old growth in shade tolerant species. When fire 
was more prevalent few stands would have had 
the opportunity to reach this structure. 
When the overstory trees in a lodgepole pine 
stand begin to die and fall , the overstory probably 
will not persist for more than 50 years or so. 
Description 
Many people do not believe that lodgepole pine 
old growth really exists. Using a definition of old­
growth where astand must be climax would 
eliminate much of the Region's lodgepole pine as 
old growth. However, the seral lodgepole pine 
condition can exhibit old-growth characteristics 
albeit they may not last long in one place, but 
overall in a landscape this old-growth condition 
can exist for quite some time. Lodgepole pine is 
more dynamic in its landscape behavior than the 
more shade tolerant species such as Engelmann 
spruce or subalpine fir. 
In a seral condition lodgepole pine old growth 
would be described as having an overstory of 
large old trees without lower limbs, with dead or 
dying tops and with crowns that are sparse, open 
branched and somewhat flattened (fig 4). 
The stand would probably have mistletoe, rust 
or stem rot present contributing to the decadence 
of the overstory. The understory would consist of 
Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir. Depending 
on the age of the understory there could be a fair 
amount of structure and variation in tree diam­
eters within the stand. Some down material 
would be present, increasing as the overstory 
continued to degenerate. It is important to note 
that when the older lodgepole pine is replaced by 
the understory, the stand is no longer old growth. 
The stand would be a young spruce-fir stand. 
Where lodgepole pine is considered climax, old 
growth will again include large old trees lacking 
lower limbs and with dead or dying tops and 
crowns with sparse foliage, open branched, 
misshapened and somewhat flattened. It would 
probably have mistletoe, rust and/or stem rot 
present contributing to the decadence of the 
overstory. However, it wiil not have the spruce-fir 
understory. It wiil most likely have one canopy 
layer and thus not much structure. There prob­
ably would be very little variation in tree diam­
eter. There may be a lot or little down dead 
. material depending on how advanced the decline 
is of the overstory. In stands that are very old 
perhaps 300 or more years old, there may be a · 
fair amount of stand structure developed due to 
trees developing in openings created by trees in 
the original overstory that had fallen.

INTERIOR PONDEROSA PINE­ 
SAF COVER TYPE 237  
(Front Range)  
Narrative 
Front Range ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa 
var. scopulorurn) forests extend along the east 
slope of the Rocky Mountains from south of 
Pueblo on the Pike/San Isabel National Forest 
north to the Laramie Peak area on the Medicine 
Bow National Forest. It occurs at elevations 
between 6,000 and 8,000 feet, lower than the 
other Rocky Mountain conifers except for pinyon 
juniper and is well adapted to the warm dry sites 
. at these lowe r elevations. Although there are 
stands of pure ponderosa pine, it frequently 
occurs with Douglas-fi r and is often referred to as 
mixed conifer. 
. 
Ponderosa pine is shade intolerant. It occurs in 
stands that "are open-grown, often lower in stock­
ing than other conifers and interspersed with 
.meadows and parks. Fire has played a very 
important role in shaping ponderosa pine stands. 
In the past cool, light ground fir es would burn 
through ponderosa pine stands every 8-15 years, 
removing competing understory vegetation, down 
dead material and young trees. This resulted in 
developing irregular shaped stands with even­
aged groups of trees varying in si ze. Patchy 
distribution of clumps of trees varying in size, age 
and density are characteristic of naturally occur- . 
ring ponderosa pine forests. 
Where ponderosa pine is the sole species or fire 
is still part of the ecology, it can be considered the 
climax species. These stands develop into and 
remain as open-grown, irregular and uneven­
aged stands. Some stands with trees over 450 
years do exist but 300 to 350 year old trees are 
more common. 
Where fire has been excluded and the more 
shade tolerant Douglas-fir is present; ponderosa 
pine is generally considered seral. The open­
grown stands develop an understory of more 
shade tolerant species such as Douglas-fir. These 
more shade tolerant species will replace the 
ponderosa pine ifnot removed whether by fire or 
some other means. On si tes more marginal in 
growing conditions it can exist with other species 
and not be replaced by them. 
The lower elevations where ponderosa pine 
grows are easily accessible and have been highly 
influenced by man's activities compared to coni­
fers growing a t higher elevations. Consequently, 
most ponderosa pine sta nds have been harvested 
for mining timber, lumber and railroad ties and 
used heavily for recreation. As a result few 
stands of ponderosa pine over 150 years old exist 
except in isolated areas that were difficult to 
access. 
Description 
Where ponderosa pine is climax and fire has 
been present, stands will contain clumps of large 
uneven-aged trees with little understory or down 
woody material and few if any standing dead 
trees (fig. 5). 
Where fire has been controlled or less frequent 
there will be old large trees with smaller size 
trees in the understory giving the stand some 
structure. Dead down material will be present in 
varying amounts along with some standing dead 
trees. In both cases the large old trees will have 
irregular, open and large branched crowns and 
have lost their lower branches. The bark will al so 
be thick, have large and somewhat concave 
112  

plates and have a lighter color compared to 
younger trees. Burls and other deformities may 
be present including fire scars that could be 
completely healed over. 
Where ponderosa pine is seral due to the lack 
of frequent fires or the site is outside its normal 
range, stands will contain large trees with a 
multi-layer canopy and contain various amounts 
of standing and down dead trees (fig. 6). 
It has an understory component of smaller 
trees including the more shade tolerant Douglas­
fir filling in the openings between the groups of 
older ponderosa pine.

Rills of South Dakota and Wyoming and the Bear 
Lodge Mountains of Wyoming. Here it forms a

unique and isolated ecotype of the interior pon­
derosa pine type. It usually grows in pure stands 
at 3,600 to 7,000 feet in elevation. 
Old photographs show ponderosa pine growing 
in even-aged clumps or groups of trees apparently 
before the 1870's. These groups or clumps were 
separated by grassy areas or parks. This condi­
tion dominated the landscape and was similar to 
that of ponderosa pine in other parts of the Rocky 
Mountain Region where periodic low intensity 
fires removed competing vegetation and pre­
vented large numbers of trees from maturing. 
Where periodic, low intensity fires were not 
part of the ecosystem, ponderosa pine grew in a 
multi-storied and a more homogeneous and 
denser condition with standing dead and down 
trees. 
A few old ponderosa pine stands, about 350 
years old, remain in the Black Hills. Virtually all 
of the accessible areas have been cut over at least : 
once since the mid 1870's. The open-grown 
clumps of ponderosa pine have been converted to 
stands with an older overstory and a young 
understory through harvesting and intensive 
management. The amount of stocking has been 
dramatically increased with the control of fire.' 
Ponderosa pine is considered a climax species 
in the Black Hills. After fire or other distur­
bances, the stand may temporarily be replaced by 
other plant species but will soon return to pon­
derosa pine. 
Since little old-growth ponderosa pine remains 
in the Black Hills old growth will have to develop 
from existing stands. It will take active manage­
ment to return existing stands to an old-growth 
condition similar to that which dominated the 
landscape at pre-settlement. 
. Where old-growth stands do exist a dense 
understory of younger trees has developed due to 
the absence of fire. This is dramatically different 
from what existed as old growth prior to the 
1870's. 
Description 
Where periodic, low intensity fires have been 
part of the ecosystem, old-growth stands would 
consist of clumps or groups of trees with grasses 
in the openings between the clumps. They would 
contain large old trees with open branches, 
irregular and flattened crowns. The clumps or 
groups of trees would contain little down dead 
material and few small trees. 
Where periodic, low intensity fires have not 
been part of the ecosystem, old-growth stands 
would contain large old trees with open branches 
and irregular crowns. The stands would have 
multiple canopy layers made up of various aged 
trees. They would be well stocked with trees and 
contain standing dead and down trees.

INTERIOR PONDEROSA PINE­
SAF COVER TYPE 237 
(Southwest) 
Narrative 
Southwest ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa 
var. scopulorurn) occurs in Region 2 in the south­
west portion of Colorado, but covers extensive 
areas of Arizona, New Mexico and southern 
Utah. As with ponderosa pine elsewhere, it occurs 
at the lower elevations between 6,000 and 8,000 . 
feet. It reaches maximum development between 
7,000 and 7,800 feet where it is a climax forest. 
Southwestern ponderosa pine is shade intoler­
ant. It occurs in stands that are open-grown, 
often poorly stocked and interspersed with mead­
ows and parks. Fire has played a very important 
role in shaping ponderosa pine stands. In the 
past, low intensity fires would bum through 
ponderosa pine stands every 8-15 years, remov­
ing competing understory vegetation and down 
material. This resulted in irregular shaped 
stands of even-aged groups of trees varying in 
size, age and density. There is a greater variation 
in age groups than for ponderosa pine elsewhere 
as the occurrence of having good moisture, seed 
production and germination is quite infrequent. 
114 

Figure 7. Large open-branched crown of an old ponderosa pine tree on 
the San.Juan NF in southwestern Colorado. 
At the lower elevation limits, pinyon-juniper may 
grOW in association with ponderosa pine. 
Where ponderosa pine is the sole species or low 
stocking and frequent fires are still part of the 
ecosystem, it can be considered a climax species. 
Some stands with trees over 450 years do exist 
but more commonly contain trees 300 to 350 
years old. 
Where periodic low intensity fires have been 
eliminated from the ecosystem, allowing more 
shade tolerant species such as Douglas-fir or 
white fir to survive, ponderosa pine is seral. It 
will eventually be replaced by more shade toler­
ant species. The existing open-grown stands are 
developing understories of Douglas-fir, white fir, 
and blue spruce with Gambel oak filling in the 
openings. These old-growth stands will eventu­
ally be replaced by these species if fire or some 
other low intensity disturbance is kept out of the 
ecosystem. 
As with ponderosa pine elsewhere, it has been 
easy to access and has been heavily used since 
the mining days of the 1850's. It has been har­
vested for many things such as mine props, 
railroad ties, lumber, and firewood. Grasses 
growing in the open areas provided forage for 
livestock. Harvesting in the last 30 years or so 
has generally been by selection and has main­
tained the uneven-aged structure of old-growth 
stands. However, with the exclusion of fire, these 
stands are developing thick understories of 
Gambel oak, pine and Douglas-fir with abuildup 
of down dead material, providing excellent condi­
tions for catastrophic fires that could completely 
eliminate the stands. Ponderosa pine will be 
replaced by the more shade tolerant species such 
as Douglas-fir. The dense Gambel oak understory 
is also difficult to remove, further complicating 
ponderosa pine being returned to a pre-settle­
. ment old-growth condition through management. 
Description 
Where fire has been present, stands will be 
climax and contain groups of large; old trees with 
little understory vegetation or down woody 
material and few standing dead trees. The age 
difference of the groups of trees would be large. 
Where fire is less frequent there will also be 
.. smaller size trees in the understory giving the 
stand some structure with various canopy layers. 
Dead, down material will be present in varying 
amounts along with some standing dead trees. In 
both cases the large old trees will have irregular 
open, large branched crowns (fig, 7). The bark 
will be lighter in color, almost yellow, thick and 
some will likely have basal fire scars. 
Where ponderosa pine is seral, generally where 
fire has been controlled or outside of its optimum 
elevational range, stands will contain large trees 
with a multi-layer canopy with various amounts 
of down, dead material and standing dead trees

(fig. 8). It will have an understory component of 
smaller trees such as Douglas-fir, blue spruce, 
white fir and Gambel oak, filling in the openings 
between the groups of the large older ponderosa 
pine. Eventually these species will replace pon­
derosa pine. There would be varying amounts of 
dead, down material and some standing dead 
trees. The large old trees will h ave irregular 
open, large branched crowns. The bark will be 
lighter in color, almost yellow and thick or platy.

ASPEN - SAF ~OVER TYPE 217 
Narrative 
The aspen (Populus tremuloides) cover type 
occurs throughout Region 2 a nd is associated 
with both montane and subalpine vegetation. 
Aspen is found within a broad eleva tion a l and 
moisture gradient occurring on all aspects and 
slopes, with the most extensive aspen forests 
occurring between 8,500 and 10,000 feet eleva­
tion, similar in elevation to lodgepole pine. 
Aspen is the most shade intolerant tree species 
in the Rocky Mountain Region. Unlike the other 
major tree species in the Region, most aspen 
regeneration is by sprouting or suckering rather 
than by seeding. Aspen does produce seed but 
requires a bare mineral soil with constant mois­
ture to germinate. Rarely does this occur. Typi­
cally aspen regenerates after a major disturban 
such a s fire, abnormal wind or snow storms, or 
harvesting by clear felling. In conifer s t ands 
where aspen is a minor component, the major-it­
of the regeneration after a stand r eplaci ng dist~ 
bance can be aspen . Aspen stands can reach an 
age of 160 or more yea rs but the a ver a ge life 
span is probably closer to 125 years. 
Like lodgepole pine, aspen is generally consid 
ered a seral species. And like lodgepole pine, mo 
aspen stands regenerate following some major 
stand replacing event such as fire. As the aspen 
matures, it will be usually replaced by the more 
shade tolerant Engelmann spruce and aubalpi ns 
fir and in southwest Colorado al so by white fir 
and Douglas-fir. The stand may still contain 
some scattered aspen. 
. 
In areas where no Engelmann spruce or subal 
pine fir seed source exists, the aspen stand will 
not be replaced by another species and can be 
considered climax. Two things could happen. Th. 
stand could reach its maximum life span and thr 
overstory aspen trees rapidly fall with reproduc­
tion being sparse as aspen generally requires a 
major disturbance to initiate abundant sproutinj 
Or the overstory aspen trees could gradually fall 
This path could have two possible results. The 
stand would not reproduce under itself. Or it 
would reproduce under itself, creating a multi­
level canopy of various tree ages. This condition 
could continue for many generations. In any case 
it is difficult to predict which path the stand 
would take. Any down dead m aterial would 
quickly decompose. 
Description 
Many people believe that aspen old growth 
does not exist. Using a definition of old growth 
where a stand must be climax to be old growth 
would elimin a te much of the Region's aspen as 
old growth. However, the seral aspen condition 
can exhibit some old-growth characteristics. The: 
. m ay not last long in one place but overall in the 
landscape this old-growth condition can exist for 
quite sometime. 
In a seral condition aspen old growth would be 
characterized as having a single canopy level of 
old trees. The aspen would be the overstory 
which would be closed with an understory of 
Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir. However, 
there could be instances where the conifers have 
become the overstory. Depending on the age of 
the understory could be a fair amount of struc­
ture and variation in tree diameters. There 
probably would not be much dead down material 
until the aspen stand began to degenerate. Then 
the a m ou n t of down dead material would accu­
116

Uncompahgre and Gunnison NF near Kebler Pass. Stand is ap­
proximately 100 years old. 
mulate quickly as the aspen stand would degen­
erate rapidly. It is important to note that if the 
understory conifers are relatively young, the 
remaining stand may not be ,old growth. 
Where aspen is considered climax, old growth 
will again include a canopy of old large aspen 
trees which would be closed. However, the stand 
would have little structure as there would be no 
understory conifers and little down trees or 
standing dead trees (fig. 9). 
Once stand deterioration started, mature 
sterns could die and fall rather quickly, or the 
process might take some time. An .overstory of 
various levels with trees of various ages and 
some down dead trees would then exist. This 
condition might exist over successive generations. 
However, if no regeneration occurred when sterns 
died, a single canopied, thinly stocked stand 
containing gaps in the canopy and down dead 
trees might persist until all the remaining trees 
had fallen.

PINYON-JUNIPER - SAF COVER TYPE 239 
Narrative 
Pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) and juniper 
(J uniperus scopulorum) comprise the pinyon­
juniper cover type. Pinyon-juniper occurs as a 
forest type but more often as woodland as the 
trees are generally shorter than 20 feet and the 
crowns rarely touch. Pinyon-juniper is found in 
the southern and western portions of Region 2 
extending just into the southern portion ofWyo­
mingoAlthough pinyon-juniper usually refers to a 
mixture of both species it may consist ofjust 
either one. It occupies the lower and warmest 
elevations growing from 4,500 to 9.000 feel 
growing in a semiarid climate. It grows best just 
below the lower elevational r ange of ponderosa 
pine and may also intermix with ponderosa pine. 
The stands exhibit considerable diversity in 
appearance and com position. 
Stands may consist of all ages or one age. 
Dominant trees are often 400 years old. Trees 
800 to 1000 years old.have been recorded. The 
trees can be single stemmed or have a sprawling ' 
multi-stemmed character. A few stands may have 
closed canopies with single or both tree species, 
with little or no understory, but most stands are 
open-grown With widely scattered trees of on e or 
both species with a wide variety of understory 
vegetation. 
The pinyon-juniper woodland is shade intoler­
ant. It is the climax cover type remaining on the 
117 

site until disturbed by fire. When disturbed by 
fire it will revert to grasses and eventually return 
to pinyon-juniper woodland. 
. 
The pinyon-juniper woodland has been used for 
grazing, firewood, building material and espe­
cially prized for its pine nuts for over 400 years. 
Few untouched natural stands probably exist. 
With the reduction in fire and possibly the reduc­
tion of competing grasses due to grazing, pinyon­
juniper woodland is increasing its area and also 
tree densities within existing stands. 
Description 
An old-growth pinyon-juniper stand would be 
fairly open grown and contain a cohort of domi­
nant old slow growing trees with little or no 
understory of grass or shrubs. The old trees 
would be single to multi-stemmed and shorter 
than the tree species at higher elevations. Being 
open grown it would be hard to distinguish if 
more than one tree canopy exists. The old trees 
would vary in diameter some would have dead 
branchesllimbs including even part of the stem. 
There would be an occasional dead standing tree. 
Down dead material would exist and for quite 
awhile as the climate is semiarid. However a 
significant amount of the dead material would 
also exist on the live trees.

GLOSSARY OF OLD-GROWTH ATTRffiUTES 
Forest Cover Type - a descriptive classifica­
tion of forested land based on present occupancy 
of an area by tree species. Forest cover types are 
named after predominant tree species. Predomi­
nance is determined by basal area and the name 
is confined to one (ponderosa pine) or two (spruce­
fir ) species. The mixed-species/mixed conifer 
forest cover type is not a forest cover type in itself 
as defined by SAP but includes several forest 
cover types. 
Attributes .: The elements·that are measured 
to determine the classification of a stand as old­
growth. They are as follows: 
Standard Attributes 
1. Live trees: 
Upper canopy - a grouping of the taller (domi­
nant and codominant) trees in the stand. For 
live trees the following attributes of minimum 
DBH, number of trees per acre, and age refer 
to the upper canopy of the stand. There must 
. be an upper canopy of trees meeting these 
minimums for the stand to be considered old 
growth. 
Minimum DBH - this refers to trees in the 
upper canopy and not to average DBH for the 
stand which would generally be lower. It is 
the minimum DBH that would be required for 
the stand to be considered old growth. DBH is 
the diameter of a tree at 4.5 feet from the 
ground measured on the uphill side. It is 
generally outside bark. However, if the tree is 
dead and the bark has fallen then it would 
not include bark. 
Minimum DRC - this is used for woodland 
species such as pinyon-juniper. DRC is the 
diameter at the root collar. The root collar is 
the region where the root and stem merge. 
Minimum Number of Trees Per Acre - the 
minimum number of trees per acre in the 
upper canopy meeting or exceeding the above 
minimum DBH. 
Minimum Age - the minimum mean age of the 
trees in the upper canopy meeting or exceed­
ing the above DBH. This would be total tree 
age. Age is just one part of the equation for a 
stand to be old growth. A stand could meet 
the minimum age requirements and may still . 
not be old growth. Age has been included as 
an attribute to give an idea of what age old 
growth IS thought to begin. It is the attributes 
that develop with age such as stand structure, 
dead trees, down material, distinctive bark, 
net stand growth near zero and tree deca­
dence that need to be considered. Some 
stands may meet the minimum age require­
118  

merit but have not yet developed these other 
attributes. 
Variation in Tree Diameters- there are trees 
of various diameters present in the stand. 
This would allude to an uneven aged stand
and/or a stand with more than one tree spe­
cies. All of which suggest a more structured 
stand. No diameter ranges have been sug­
gested as little is known what they should be.
However it was common consensus that such
an attribute is an important characteristic of
old growth. 
Decadence - this refers to the trees in the 
upper canopy. The tops or crowns of some of 
the trees are broken, dead, deformed or have 
sparse foliage or the stems have rot and/or 
root rot. These are indicators that the stand 
could be past maturity and declining. Growth 
is being succeeded by mortality. The stand is 
not young and vigorously growing. It could 
also mean that the stand has been infected 
with some disease and that's all. But if the 
above attributes are present in a stand, 
decadence would be a further indicator of old 
growth. No values are listed as no data is 
available on how many trees should have 
reached senescence. 
Multiple Tree Canopy Layers - more than one 
tree canopy layer or story is present. A canopy
layer or story is roughly a horizontal stratum 
or layer formed by the crowns of trees. A . 
stand can have one to many canopy layers. 
Generally trees of the same,age or species 
tend to grow to the same height in a stand. 
This height or horizontal layer formed by the 
tree crowns would be a canopy layer. The 
tallest canopy layer representing the most 
crown cover in a stand would generally be the 
upper canopy layer. 
Dead Trees  
Standing - a tree, vertical or near vertical , 
that is supporting itself or leaning on another
tree. A standing dead tree is also called a 
snag.
Minimum DBH - the minimum diameter 
at 4.5 feet that a dead tree would be 
considered for old growth. 
Minimum Number of Trees Per Acre - the 
minimurn nurnber of dead trees per acre 
that are equal to or above the minimum 
DBH to be considered for old growth. 
Down - tree that has fallen down , is dead and 
laying horizontal. May be a whole tree or  
section of one. All , part or none of the whole  
tree or section may be touching the forest  
floor.  
Additional and Quality Attributes 
Trees in Upper Canopy Are Slow Growing­
trees are growing slower than in the past. 
This indicates the stand has reached maturity 
and/or may be over-mature, that is past it's 
peak of maximum growth. Generally the 
crowns are beginning to flatten and become 
broader and more open. 
Canopy Closure Greater Than 50% - 50% or 
more of the ground is covered by foliage of the 
upper canopy in a vertical projection. 
Wide Range of Tree Vigor - trees in the stand 
are growing at various rates from vigorous 
growth to almost no growth. 
Net Growth Near Zero - this applies to the 
stand as a whole. Basically the amount of 
new growth is offset by trees dying. 
Patchiness - a stand has breaks in the upper 
canopy level and/or has openings. An opening 
is defined as an area within the stand that 
contains vegetation different than the major­
ity of the stand, such as grasses, forbs, shrubs 
and young trees. 
Many Stages ofDecomposition - this refers to 
the dead material either standingor down. 
The dead material is in various conditions of 
decay. 
Multiple Tree Species - there is more than one 
tree species in the stand. 
Distinctive Bark - some species of trees with 
age acquire bark characteristics that are 
much different (distinctive) than when 
younger and vigorously growing. The bark 
becomes platy that -is it has large patches 
with deep furrows in between the patches. 
The bark may also be different in color for 
some species. Darker for lodgepole pine, 
reddish for spruce-fir and light tan or yellow 
for ponderosa pine. 
Distinctive Crowns in the Upper Canopy - as 
they age some species of conifer trees acquire 
crown characteristics that are much different 
than when young. The crowns loose their 
conical shape as growth diminishes with the 
crowns flattening. Crowns develop holes, 
become misshapen and foliage develops dead 
areas. Branching is more open with large 
branches. Part or all of the crown can die. 
These characteristics are very eviden t in older 
ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine trees. 
These characteristics can also be attributable 
to insects or pathogens so the other attributes 
need to be considered as well.
