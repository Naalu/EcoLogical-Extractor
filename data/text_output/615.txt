Background:  
     
The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 
2008 (commonly referred to as the Farm Bill) 
was enacted on June 19, 2008.  The legislation 
amended the Cooperative Forestry Assistance 
Act of 1978 and requires each state to 
complete a Statewide Forest Resource 
Assessment, followed by the development of a 
Statewide Forest Resource Strategy to receive, 
or continue to receive, funds under the 
Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act (CFAA).  
 
CFAA funds are provided to states through the 
State and Private Forestry (S&PF) organization 
of the USDA Forest Service. Currently, Arizona 
receives several million dollars annually to 
protect communities from wildfire, assist 
private forest landowners, promote healthy 
forest practices, and assist communities with 
their urban forests. Most of the CFAA funding 
received by the Arizona State Forestry Division 
is passed by way of grants to local 
organizations that provide matching funds and 
additional implementation resources. The 
combination of state and local efforts along 
with coordination and collaboration with 
federal, tribal, and other land management 
agencies provides substantial leveraging of 
these funds to benefit Arizona forests and 
citizens. 
 
Legislative Requirements:  
      
The amended Cooperative Forestry Assistance 
Act of 2008 added new requirements for the 
states to identify priority forest landscape 
areas and highlight work needed to address 
national, regional and state forest 
management priorities: 
    
1. A State-wide Assessment of Forest 
Resources. 
2. A Statewide Forest Resource Strategy. 
The Assessment and Resource Strategy must 
be completed by June 2010 and later approved 
by the US Secretary of Agriculture.  Annual 
accomplishment reporting will begin in 2011. 
 
National Priorities:  
      
For State and Private Forestry program 
funding, the 2008 legislation also requires 
focus on landscape level outcomes to achieve 
national private forest conservation priorities: 
         
 
Conserve and manage working forest 
landscapes 
 
Protect forests from threats  
 
Enhance public benefits from private 
forests

1. Forest Resource Assessment:  
    
The first step in the overall process will be 
completion of the Forest Resource 
Assessment.  The National Association of State 
Foresters (NASF) and the State and Private 
Forestry (S&PF) organization of the USDA 
Forest Service have collaborated to provide 
more specific guidance to states for completion 
of the assessment. The guidance provides the 
following minimum requirements for the 
Resource Assessment: 
 
o Provide an analysis of present and future 
forest conditions, trends, and threats on all 
ownerships in the state using publicly 
available information. 
o Identify forest related threats, benefits, and 
services consistent with the S&PF Redesign 
national themes. 
o Delineate priority rural and urban forest 
landscape areas to be addressed by the 
state forest resource strategy.  
o Work with neighboring states and 
governments to identify any multi-state 
areas that are a regional priority. 
o Incorporate existing statewide plans 
including Wildlife Action Plans, Community 
Wildfire Protection Plans, and address 
existing S&PF program planning 
requirements.  
 
In Arizona, considerable analysis and planning 
has been completed by state and federal 
agencies, non-profit organizations, academic 
institutions, and collaborative groups. It is 
anticipated that a large portion of the required 
new assessment work will build upon these 
earlier activities.   
It is also the goal of the Arizona Forestry 
Division for the Resource Assessment and 
Strategy to address not only the national 
private forest conservation priorities, but also 
to be a useful tool to a wide range of 
organizations and the basis of future work in 
Arizona to address our forest resource issues. 
 
Assessment Task Group:  
   
In July 2009 the Arizona State Forester 
appointed a Forest Resource Assessment Task 
Group to work with Forestry Division staff in 
developing recommendations for an Arizona 
Forest Resource Assessment. 
 
Task Group Membership includes 
representatives from: 
 
• 
Arizona State Forestry Division 
• 
Arizona Community Tree Council 
• 
Arizona Forest Health Council 
• 
Arizona Forest Stewardship Committee 
• 
Arizona Game and Fish Department 
• 
Ecological Restoration Institute at NAU 
• 
The Nature Conservancy  
• 
USDA Forest Service  
• 
USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service 
• 
U.S. Bureau of Land Management 
• 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
 
The Task Group began meeting in August 2009 
and expects to continue work until the 
Assessment is complete in early 2010.   
 
2. Forest Resource Strategy:  
     
Work is expected to begin on the Arizona 
Forest Resource Strategy in late 2009, once 
the Assessment is substantially underway.  
The Arizona State Forester will appoint a 
second interagency task group to work with 
Forestry Division staff to provide assistance 
with this strategy component.  
 
Where possible, the strategy will complement 
other state and federal agency assessment 
and planning work. 
 
3. Annual Reporting:  
     
Annual reporting will be required by 2011 and 
will include information about activities of the 
Arizona State Forestry Division as well as 
activities by other agencies and organizations 
working toward our common objectives and 
outcomes.
