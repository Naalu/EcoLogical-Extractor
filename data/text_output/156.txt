Spatial variation in reference conditions:
historical tree density and pattern on a Pinus
ponderosa landscape
Scott R. Abella and Charles W. Denton
Abstract: The reference conditions of historical tree density and pattern underpin ecological restoration and management
of Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex Lawson & C.Lawson forests in western North America, yet the potential spatial variation
in these variables across the landscape remains unclear. We reconstructed historical (1880) tree density and spatial pattern
on 1 ha plots at 53 sites within a 110 000 ha P. ponderosa landscape in northern Arizona, compared these variables among
US Forest Service ecosystem classification units, and modeled spatial variation with environmental variables. Mean tree
density differed 19-fold among nine ecosystem types, and regression trees using four soil or climatic variables explained
62%–74% of the variation in density. Although density was more sensitive to environmental variation than was pattern,
we did not find the clumped pattern widely described for P. ponderosa forests to be universal across ecosystems. Results
suggest that (i) multivariate combinations of soil and climatic properties influenced historical forest structure, (ii) as much
variation exists in reference conditions within the study landscape as between P. ponderosa regions, (iii) ecosystem classi-
fication is a useful framework for quantifying spatial variation in reference conditions, and (iv) determining spatial varia-
tion in reference conditions can assist resource managers in prioritizing areas for management and in developing
ecosystem-specific management strategies within landscapes.

Introduction
The concept of reference conditions underpins ecological
restoration and many applications in forest management.
Reference conditions represent baseline conditions prior to
ecosystem degradation (due to fire exclusion or any number
of factors) or examples of ecosystems believed to have a
structure and function consistent with the evolutionary envi-
ronment of species indigenous to the ecosystem (White and
Walker 1997). The relative deviance between reference and
present or disturbed conditions can illuminate needs for
management interventions and how effective those interven-
tions are for producing desired conditions (Moore et al.
1999). Many authors have written about the validity of
reference conditions given changes in contemporary forests
and climate change (e.g., Covington et al. 1999; Millar and
Brubaker 2006). Understanding past conditions is even more
crucial now for understanding current and future forest pat-
terns in a changing climate. For example, it is widely known
precisely because of information derived from reference
conditions that current high-density Pinus ponderosa Doug-
las ex Lawson & C.Lawson (ponderosa pine) forests in
western North America are not natural or sustainable
(Swetnam et al. 1999). This reference information illustrated

a set of ecosystem conditions and processes different from
that of today that was sustainable through at least several
generations of trees (translating to several thousands of
years in P. ponderosa forests; Moore et al. 1999). This is
unlike present conditions where insect outbreaks and stand-
replacing wildfires in formerly frequent-fire forests eradicate
trees and can type convert the forests to shrublands (Savage
and Mast 2005). For these reasons, the utility of reference
conditions as a consideration in developing forest restoration
and management plans is well established, and understand-
ing reference conditions is an active area of ecological re-
search (e.g., Brown et al. 2008; Sa´nchez Meador et al.
2009).
Although the potential importance of spatial variation in
reference
conditions is recognized
(White and Walker
1997), reference conditions have only rarely been (i) com-
pared among soil or ecosystem classification units across a
landscape (defined as an area large enough to contain a mo-
saic of ecosystems types and often >4000 ha) or (ii) related
to environmental gradients. Fralish et al. (1991) used wit-
ness tree data from 1806–1807 land survey records, prior to
pervasive timber harvest and fire exclusion, to compare for-
est composition among six site types (defined by topo-
graphic variables such as slope position and aspect) in
southern Illinois deciduous forests. Mean forest basal area
ranged widely among site types — from 9 m2/ha on dry,
rocky south slopes dominated by Quercus stellata Wangenh.
(post oak) to 22 m2/ha on terraces near drainages inhabited
by Quercus alba L. (white oak) and Quercus velutina Lam.
(black oak). In another example, Cleland et al. (2004) com-
pared historical (1836–1858) and modern (1985–2000) fire
return intervals among six landscape ecosystem types in an
ecosystem classification of northern Lower Michigan. The
relative deviation from reference fire conditions in modern
forests varied among ecosystems. A dry-mesic ecosystem in-
curred the largest change with a 66-fold decrease in fire fre-
quency, whereas extremely
xeric or mesic ecosystems
sustained 6- to 13-fold declines. These examples suggest a
potential for using ecological land classification systems as
frameworks for understanding spatial variation in reference
conditions and environmental gradients related to this varia-
tion. This is especially important on large landscapes where
foresters need tools for categorizing diverse sites and under-
standing broad-scale variation in resource conditions and re-
sponses to management (Palik et al. 2000).
Pinus ponderosa forests occupy vast areas of semiarid
western North America and typify a need to understand
reference conditions across broad areas. These forests occur
on more than 3.4 ! 106 ha in the states of Arizona and New
Mexico alone (Brown 1994) and inhabit a variety of land-
forms and soil parent materials with potential for inducing
environmental variation in ecological variables. As a domi-
nant species, P. ponderosa influences the entire forest eco-
system, affecting understory vegetation, soils, insect and
animal communities, and fire behavior (Moore et al. 1999).
Pinus ponderosa trees also are the major structural compo-
nents that forest managers can manipulate (Harrod et al.
1999; Youngblood et al. 2004). Elevated tree densities aris-
ing since fire exclusion in the past century in P. ponderosa
forests have negatively affected forest health by accelerating
the mortality of old trees, facilitating insect outbreaks, di-
minishing understory productivity, and increasing fire se-
verity (Covington and Moore 1994). Tree thinning to help
remedy these deleterious conditions has been widely pro-
posed and must be extensively and strategically applied
across large areas to have measurable effects consistent
with this forest type’s broad land mass (Brown et al. 2008).
Frequent-fire, historical P. ponderosa forests in northern
Arizona have been described as low-density, open, savanna-
like stands consisting of clumps of pine trees interspersed
with grassy or shrubby openings (White 1985). Yet, it is un-
certain how consistent this generalized model of density and
pattern was, either within or among landscapes, and which
environmental factors coincided with any spatial variation.
Within climatic regions supporting P. ponderosa, spatial
variation in climate could affect density or pattern, where
low precipitation may limit tree establishment and cause
stems to be widely spaced to relax competition (Boyden et
al. 2005). Conversely, areas with low precipitation could ex-
hibit increased clumping by restricting trees to a limited
number of favorable patches. Soils also could have affected
density and pattern, where xeric or nutrient-poor soils limit
recruitment. On the other hand, trees on environmentally
stressed sites may grow slower and live longer, which could
increase density. Soils could have affected P. ponderosa re-
cruitment in other ways, such as the effects mediated
through understory vegetation. Soils influence understory
productivity, and competition between pine seedlings and
understory plants can be intense (Riegel et al. 1992). Dis-
turbance regimes, such as variation in fire or grazing, also
may affect forest patterns and co-vary with environmental
factors (Grimm 1984). These observations suggest that
many variables could influence the distribution and pattern
of P. ponderosa or, more generally, any dominant species
within and among landscapes.
The purpose of this study was to examine spatial variation
in the reference conditions of historical tree density and pat-
tern to determine how general the reference conditions (low
density, clumped forests) proposed in the literature for
P. ponderosa forests are across the landscape. Our specific
objectives were to (1) compare historical tree density and
pattern among landscape ecosystem units classified in a US
Forest Service terrestrial ecosystem survey and (2) model
variation in density and pattern with gradients in environ-
mental variables (climate, topography, and soils). We hy-
pothesized that density was lower and spatial patterns more
clumped in dry ecosystems than moist ecosystems. We fur-
ther anticipated that variables associated with moisture
availability (e.g., soil texture, precipitation) would be most
strongly related to variation in density and pattern across
the landscape.
Materials and methods
Study area
We conducted this study within an area of 110 000 ha on
the northern half of the Coconino National Forest and the
Northern Arizona University Centennial Forest in northern
Arizona, USA (Fig. 1). Study sites ranged in elevation from
1921 to 2564 m and were located in the P. ponderosa forest
zone. Precipitation primarily occurs in winter as snow (ca.
50% of annual precipitation) and as summer monsoonal

Graminoids dominate understories, often including combina-
tions of Bouteloua gracilis (Willd. ex Kunth) Lag. ex Grif-
fiths (blue grama), Carex geophila Mack. (White Mountain
sedge), Elymus elymoides (Raf.) Swezey (squirreltail), Fes-
tuca arizonica Vasey (Arizona fescue), and Muhlenbergia
montana (Nutt.) Hitchc. (mountain muhly). Five site-specific
fire-history studies, summarized in Van Horne and Fule´
(2006), reported mean fire intervals of 2–5 years in the
study area for presettlement (prior to Euro-American settle-
ment and fire exclusion) forests prior to the late 1800s.
Ecosystem classification
Many systems of ecosystem classification have been de-
veloped, such as the Canadian Forest Service ecosystem
classification program, US Natural Resource Conservation
Service ecological site types, various US Forest Service sys-
tems, and individual research projects (McMahon et al.
2001). These systems are similar and group sites exhibiting
like topography, soils, and vegetation into ecosystem types,
thereby dividing landscapes into ecosystem mapping units.
The US Forest Service in Region 3 (Arizona and New Mex-
ico) terms its ecosystem classification program the Terres-
trial Ecosystem Survey, which has been completed for the
region’s national forests (Robbie 1992). Ecosystems were

classified and mapped based on climate (as influenced by el-
evation and topography), geology affecting soil parent mate-
rial, soil properties (e.g., texture), and topography (US
Forest Service 1986). Overstory and understory vegetation
further defined ecosystems, although several different eco-
systems occurred below the same overstory type, such as
for P. ponderosa forests. The minimum mapping unit was
16 ha. Our study area was covered by the Coconino Na-
tional Forest Terrestrial Ecosystem Survey described in
Miller et al. (1995) and online at http://alic.arid.arizona.edu/
tes/tes.html. In an earlier study, we compared the ecosystem
survey’s classification of sites with a research-grade ecosys-
tem classification (Abella and Covington 2006a). There was
a 1:1 correspondence for most ecosystems and only slight
differences in site classification for the closely related ba-
salt, benmorite, and mixed igneous ecosystems. The US For-
est Service assigned numerical codes to ecosystem types. In
this paper, we name the ecosystems based on soil parent ma-
terial and descriptors of moisture status or soil texture
(Table 1).
Site selection and sampling
Using a digital map of the ecosystem survey (Miller et al.
1995) in a Geographic Information System, we randomly se-
lected a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate
within each of five to seven mapping units of nine ecosys-
tem types. This resulted in 53 independent sites replicated
across the landscape (Fig. 1). The slight variation in the
number of sites among ecosystems arose from occasionally
needing to reject a selected mapping unit because of the
presence of a postsettlement fire or other disturbance that
destroyed evidence of presettlement trees.
The nine ecosystems sampled are predominant types in
the P. ponderosa zone of the study area and encompass a
range of soil parent materials, including basalt, benmorite,
limestone, and volcanic cinders (Table 1). Four soil orders
are represented by the ecosystems, with major soil sub-
groups including Typic and Udic Argiborolls, Typic and
Mollic Eutroboralfs, Typic Ustorthents, and Vitrandic Usto-
chrepts (Miller et al. 1995). Soils ranged from coarse, xeric,
N-poor volcanic cinders of the black cinder ecosystem to silt
loam, mesic, N-rich basalt of the mesic basalt type (Abella
and Covington 2006a). The driest volcanic cinder ecosys-
tems occupied precipitation-poor sites and also had low
available water and young soils, some derived as recently
as 1000 years ago from eruptions on the San Francisco Vol-
canic Field. A submesic benmorite ecosystem exhibited soil
properties and climate intermediate between the dry volcanic
cinder and moister basalt ecosystems and contained a mont-
morillinic clay layer typically within 30 cm of the surface.
A mixed igneous ecosystem surrounded the San Francisco
Peaks and had soils influenced by volcanic activity and
down slope movement of geologic and (or) soil material.
The mesic basalt ecosystem was distinguished from the re-
lated rocky basalt ecosystem by having surface soils with
greater silt content, lower rock cover, and F. arizonica as
the dominant grass (rather than Sporobolus interruptus Va-
sey (black dropseed) as found in the rocky basalt ecosys-
tem).
On each site at the randomly determined UTM coordi-
nate, we established a 100 m ! 100 m (1 ha) plot. Using

100 m tapes, we divided each plot into 25 m ! 25 m
(0.0625 ha) cells to facilitate stem mapping. Using the meth-
ods of Fule´ et al. (1997) for identifying evidence of preset-
tlement tree locations, in 2006–2007 we mapped the x, y
coordinates of each evidence of a presettlement tree to the
nearest metre. We selected the year 1880 as the forest re-
construction year across sites to represent settlement because
the start of fire exclusion has been dated between 1876 and
1883 in the study area (Van Horne and Fule´ 2006). The evi-
dence of trees alive in, or before, 1880 that we recorded in-
cluded stumps, fallen logs, snags, and old, currently living
trees (Fule´ et al. 1997). Pinus ponderosa develops orange,
platy bark by ca. 100 years of age (Schubert 1974), which
we used as a general guide for identifying presettlement-
origin trees. We cored (at 0.2 m above ground level) trees
of uncertain status and counted rings in the field to classify
these trees as pre- or post-settlement. To assess the reprodu-
cibility of mapping methods, every five plots we randomly
selected five trees for remapping after all trees had been
mapped on a plot. Ninety percent (45/50) of repeated tree
coordinates were identical to original coordinates while
10% differed by 1 m.
Environmental measurements
In the center of each plot, we recorded elevation, trans-
formed aspect (Beers et al. 1966), slope gradient, and terrain
shape index (McNab 1989). Terrain shape index measures
local topographic geometry, and we based measurements on
eight clinometer sightings every 458 to a change in topo-
graphic shape. We measured percent rock cover by record-
ing the presence or absence of rock every 0.3 m along a
25 m transect. To collect 0–15 and 15–50 cm depth soil
samples, we dug two 50 cm deep pits centered in each plot
and separated from each other by 30 m. We analyzed the air-
dry, composite (from the two pits/plot), <2 mm sieved frac-
tion for texture (hydrometer method), pH (1 : 2 soil :
0.01 mol/L CaCl2), and organic C and total N (elemental C/N
analyzer), following Sparks (1996) and Dane and Topp
(2002). We measured loss-on-ignition (2 h of heating at
300 8C) following Abella and Zimmer (2007). We also es-
timated mean bulk density and gravel content by sieving
two 208 cm3 soil cores from the 0–15 cm layer on each
plot.

and loss-on-ignition as a surrogate for organic matter (or-
ganic C ! 1.724), we modeled soil available water ca-
pacity using Saxton and Rawls’ (2006) equations and
software. We estimated monthly precipitation and mean
monthly minimum and maximum temperatures for each
plot using the parameter–elevation relationships on inde-
pendent slopes model (PRISM; Daly et al. 2008).
Data analysis
From the mapped tree coordinates, we calculated three
measures of clump characteristics. We defined clumps as
two or more trees having touching crowns or connected by
a path of trees with touching crowns. We used a crown ra-
dius of 3 m based on previous research of average crown
radii of mature ponderosa pine (Gill et al. 2000). Therefore,
trees whose bole centers were within 6 m of each other were
in the same clump. While it is unclear if crown radii of his-
torical trees varied across ecosystem types, this distance
method provided a standardized, quantitative criterion for
distinguishing clumps. Using the distance formula, we iden-
tified clumps on each plot by calculating a pairwise matrix
of tree–tree distances. We calculated the number of clumps
per hectare, mean number of trees per clump, and the pro-
portion of the total trees on a plot that were in clumps.
We compared tree density and clump characteristics
among ecosystems using one-way analysis of variance (a =
0.05) and Fisher’s protected least significant difference.
Data were analyzed on a transformed scale (square root) as
necessary to improve equality of variance and normality.
We examined bivariate relationships between tree density,
measures of clumping, and environmental variables, using
Pearson’s correlation coefficients, which returned results
similar to Spearman rank coefficients. We modeled tree den-
sity as a function of soil and climatic variables, using regres-
sion tree models in JMP software (SAS Institute Inc. 2004).
Regression trees are nonparametric models that partition
data into increasingly homogeneous subsets and provide di-
chotomous keys to estimate a dependent variable at different
values of predictor variables (Breiman et al. 1984). Analo-
gous to bivariate regression, an r2 statistic provides the pro-
portion of variability in the dependent variable accounted for
by the predictors. We stopped splitting data when adding
more predictors increased r2 by <0.05 and when a minimum
node size of n = 5 was reached. We employed JMP’s k-fold
cross-validation (k = 5) to compute a cross-validated overall
r2 (1 – (cross-validated sum of squares error / corrected sum
of squares)). In all density statistical analyses, we excluded
an outlying red cinder site containing 28% more trees per
hectare than the next highest site (among the 53 sites) and
4.4 times more trees than the next highest site in its ecosys-
tem type. We conducted a separate study (reported in Abella
(2008)) to try to understand the reasons for the uniqueness
of this site and offer possible explanations (e.g., an unusual
fire regime) for the exceptionally high density.
We analyzed tree spatial patterns on each plot, derived
from x, y tree locations, using Ripley’s K analysis. This
point–pattern analysis uses a second-order statistic based on
testing the co-occurrences of pairs of points (Ripley 1977).
We performed this analysis in the software PASSAGE, ver-
sion 1.0 (Rosenberg 2001). Settings included a 1 m step dis-
tance, a 25 m maximum distance (corresponding to 25% of
the plot distance, the largest allowed by the program), edge
effects controlled by rescaling by edge overlap area correc-
tion, and 95% confidence intervals and statistical signifi-
cance based on 99 permutations (Rosenberg 2001). We used
PASSAGE’s L(d) linear transformation of the K statistic,
where the expected value of L(d) is zero when points are
randomly distributed. Negative values of L(d) indicate
clumping, while positive values indicate regular spacing
(Dale 1999). There were four plots, all in the clay basalt
ecosystem, that were not analyzed for pattern because they
contained two or fewer trees.

(F statistic = 7.14, p < 0.0001; Fig. 2). In general, ecosys-
tems with soil parent material consisting of basalt (except
for the clay basalt ecosystem), benmorite, limestone (on me-
sic sites), and mixed igneous rock contained the greatest
densities. Xeric limestone, volcanic cinder, and basalt that
produced clayey soils exhibited the lowest densities. How-
ever, there was high variation among sites within several of
the ecosystems. For example, the mesic basalt ecosystem ex-
hibited a range of 39–143 trees/ha and a coefficient of varia-
tion (CV) of 48%. The red cinder ecosystem had five of six
sites with a relatively tight range of 17–42 trees/ha (CV =
31%) and contained among the lowest densities of all the
sites. However, the remaining site sampled in this ecosystem
contained 183 trees/ha, which was the highest by 40 trees of
all 53 sites sampled. Other ecosystems were less variable,
such as the mesic limestone type that had a range of 54–
85 trees/ha and a CV of only 15%.
In bivariate relationships, soil pH, UTM easting, and
mean annual minimum temperature were most strongly neg-
atively correlated with density (Table 2). Soil silt concentra-
tion, available water, and mean total annual precipitation
were the most positively correlated with density, although r
values were £0.35. Mean minimum temperatures for each
month were more strongly negatively related to density
(r = –0.30 to –0.42) than were maximum temperatures
(r = –0.04 to –0.25). Other measured variables that could
be related to climate or microclimate, specifically elevation,
slope gradient, transformed aspect, and terrain shape index,
were not strongly related (|r| < 0.17) to variation in density.
A regression tree model using only soil variables ex-
plained 62% of the variability in density after four divisions
and had a cross-validated r2 of 0.53 (Fig. 3). Soil texture
(silt) formed the first and most powerful division, where

sites with silt concentrations ‡46% averaged 90 trees/ha
(standard deviation (SD) = 37) and sites with < 46% silt
averaged only 46 trees/ha (SD = 28). The second division
identified soils with high volumetric N content as having
low density. The highest density sites, averaging over
100 trees/ha, were distinguished by the third division as sites
with silt ‡46% and available water capacities ‡0.15 m3/m3.

model, cooler minimum temperatures resulted in the highest
tree densities, whereas sites with warmer minimum temper-
atures, high volumetric N, and lower December precipitation
exhibited the lowest densities.
Spatial pattern
Although differing less sharply than density, the clump
characteristics of proportion of trees in clumps, mean clump
size, and maximum clump size differed significantly among
multiple ecosystem types (Fig. 2). The mean proportion of
trees in clumps ranged from 28% to 74% among ecosys-
tems, being greatest in the mesic basalt and least in the
black cinder and clay basalt types. The mean and maximum
clump sizes also were greatest in the mesic basalt ecosys-
tem. Clump characteristics were strongly correlated with
tree density (Table 2).
An array of tree spatial patterns occurred among sites
(Figs. 4 and 5). Based on Ripley’s L(d) analysis, 14 of 49
(29%) sites with sufficient densities for supporting analysis
exhibited random tree distributions from 1 to 25 m distances
(Table 3). All five sites of the black cinder ecosystem exhib-
ited a random pattern, the most of any ecosystem. The re-
maining

of
sites
had
significantly
clumped
distributions for at least 1 m increment within the 25 m step
distance. Similar to density, there was substantial variation
in pattern within some ecosystems. For example, the mesic
limestone ecosystem had a plot with extreme clumping
from 2 to 23 m but also had two plots with random distribu-
tions.
Discussion
Accuracy of reconstruction methods
A potential uncertainty with studies such as this one that
reconstruct historical forest structure is the reliability of
techniques for detecting evidence of historical tree locations.
This uncertainty primarily centers on the deadwood compo-
nent, as the status of currently live trees can be more easily
determined through dendrochronology. In our study, 27% of
the 3142 total evidences recorded were currently live trees
and 73% were deadwood. Moore et al. (2004) assessed the
accuracy of reconstruction techniques on 15 permanent plots
on P. ponderosa sites in Arizona and New Mexico estab-
lished by US Forest Service researchers in 1909–1913. Live
trees <9 cm in diameter and structures (e.g., stumps) were
mapped at the time of plot establishment and remapped 84–
90 years later in 1997–1999. Ninety-one percent of the trees
and structures could be relocated, suggesting that only 9%
of evidences of historical trees were ‘‘missed.’’ Since we
used the same techniques as Moore et al. (2004) in the
same forest type, we believe that our reconstruction accu-
racy should be similar. As Moore et al. (2004) suggested,
probably the greatest source of error in our reconstruction
techniques is the possibility of not detecting trees that were
small (such as the trees <9 cm in diameter not historically
mapped in Moore et al.’s (2004) study) at the time of settle-
ment and were harvested or died near that time. While the
possibility of ‘‘missing’’ some small trees in reconstruction
studies cannot be dismissed, dense thickets of saplings are

not believed to have been dominant components of historical
forests in this area based on assessing historical photographs
(Fule´ et al. 1997). Furthermore, early foresters wished to
protect regeneration rather than targeting such small trees
for harvest (Pearson 1923), potentially minimizing a source
of mortality. Through our site selection criteria, we also
avoided sampling sites that experienced postsettlement fires,
the major cause of destruction of historical evidence identi-
fied by Moore et al. (2004).
General patterns
Historical tree density and within-site spatial pattern both
differed among several ecosystem types along the ecosystem
gradient. However, density generally was more sensitive to
the ecosystem classification than was pattern. Seven of the
eight ecosystem types with densities sufficient on all plots
for spatial analysis had ‡67% of their plots exhibit a
clumped distribution at some spatial scale (Table 3). The ex-
ception was the black cinder ecosystem, which consistently
exhibited a random distribution. Although there were overall
differences among ecosystems in density and pattern, there
was considerable variation within several ecosystems. This
suggests that examining variation in these responses within
the frameworks of both ecosystem classification and contin-
uous environmental variables is useful for understanding for-
est patterns. Furthermore, results suggest that historical
forest patterns were associated with multivariate combina-
tions of variables, with the importance of soils and climate
outweighing topography on this landscape.
Soils
In general, especially sandy or clayey soils supported
lower tree density. Moisture availability may have limited
tree establishment on both of these soil types. For example,
June gravimetric 0–15 cm soil moisture averaged only 0.5%
in the coarse-textured, black cinder ecosystem, whereas
moisture averaged 11-fold greater in the loamy textured
rocky and mesic basalt ecosystems (Abella and Covington
2006a) that contained greater tree densities. The clayey
soils, such as those of the clay basalt ecosystem, supported
the lowest density on the landscape. Frost heaving may
have been an additional limiting factor on these clayey soils.
Haasis (1923) found that frost heaving caused twice the
mortality (18% versus 9%) of P. ponderosa seedlings on
stony–clayey soils than on cinder soils. Soils of the clay ba-
salt ecosystem contained cracks commonly 8 cm wide, indi-
cative of substantial soil contraction and expansion likely
capable of ejecting seedlings from the soil (Haasis 1923).
Soils with the highest concentrations of silt supported the
highest tree densities overall. For example, the highest cate-
gory of density (109 trees/ha) in the soil regression tree
(Fig. 3) was with soils with ‡46% 0–15 cm silt and avail-
able water capacity ‡0.15 m3/m3. There were exceptions,
however, where 3 of 13 sites with >46% silt supported only
40–49 trees/ha. These low-density silt sites contained either
low (733 and 794 kg/ha) or high (2069 kg/ha) total N rela-
tive to the 1189 kg/ha mean of all 53 sites. Soil texture is

considered a relatively stable property of soils (Welch and
Klemmedson 1975) and was likely stable during the several
hundred year historical time scale (1–2 life spans of
P. ponderosa trees) prior to our 1880 reconstruction year.
Although the total N that we measured also is considered
relatively stable, it is unclear how our contemporary meas-
ured values compare with levels experienced by historical
trees. Nevertheless, soil parent materials have not changed
during this time, and we assume that at least the relative
amounts of N differed among ecosystem types in historical
forests as they do today because of parent material effects
on productivity and soil organic matter accumulation (Welch
and Klemmedson 1975). Soils especially high in N sup-
ported lower densities on both silty sites and on other soil
textures (Fig. 3). Moist, high-N soils contain the densest
and
most
productive
grass
understories
(Abella
and
Covington 2006b). Soil effects mediated through understory
competition with P. ponderosa seedlings could have been a
major factor affecting tree recruitment (Pearson 1942).
Other soil variables had various relationships with tree
density. Soil pH had the strongest bivariate correlation
(r = –0.50) with density of all variables. However, soils
with high pH also had the lowest available water capacities
and occupied climatically dry sites (e.g., xeric limestone and
black cinder ecosystems). The pH range of all plots was
5.6–7.1,
well
within
P.
ponderosa

ranges
(Schubert 1974). Although we hypothesize that soil texture
and moisture availability more strongly affected tree recruit-
ment than pH, and that pH relationships with density were
simply correlated with parent material effects, it cannot be
ruled out that pH did somehow affect recruitment (e.g., by
influencing soil chemistry). Rock cover, gravel concentra-
tion, bulk density, and organic C content all were only
weakly correlated (|r| < 0.16) with density at landscape
scales. We did observe that the few trees that recruited on
clayey basalt soils often became established in rocky areas
of approximately 200 m2 that were possibly protected from
frost heaving or helped concentrate moisture (Long 1915).
The major difference in tree spatial pattern among ecosys-
tems was that the black cinder type exhibited random tree
patterns rather than the clumped distribution most common
in other ecosystems. Containing the sandiest and lowest-N
soils, the nonclumped pattern in this ecosystem could relate
to stronger resource partitioning where these harsh soils
were incapable of supporting many trees close together.
Other soil-related mechanisms could have induced the ob-
served random patterns. Understory vegetation cover is the
sparsest on these soils of any ecosystem type, which could
have affected fire regimes by influencing fire spread. White
(1985) hypothesized that uneven-aged clumped patterns in
P. ponderosa forests near Flagstaff were perpetuated by
‘‘safe sites,’’ where a tree dying in a clump provided fuel
for a locally intense fire that created a favorable seedbed
temporarily free from competing grasses. This hypothesis
was developed by examining a site of the mesic basalt eco-
system (the most productive type in the study area) and may
not apply to the dry black cinder soils where clumping was
not observed. Another possible explanation for the lack of
clumping in the black cinder ecosystem could be that, due
to sparse understory vegetation, seed-caching organisms that
can facilitate clumped plant regeneration were less abun-
dant. The possibility that soils had both direct (e.g., avail-
able water capacity, frost heaving, nutrients) and indirect
effects mediated through understory vegetation, other organ-
isms, and fire on historical forest structure should not be
overlooked.
Climate
It is difficult to directly separate potential soil and cli-
matic effects because soils with the lowest available water
capacities also often occupied climatically dry sites (Abella
and Covington 2006a). Average precipitation decreased
from west to east across the study area, which corresponded
to a general decrease in tree density (Fig. 1). This, combined
with dry soils in the eastern part of the study area, may ex-
plain the negative correlation of density with UTM easting
(Table 2).
In bivariate relationships, average minimum temperature
was more closely related to tree density than was precipita-
tion (Table 2). Higher minimum temperatures were associ-
ated with lower densities, which may also reflect a west–
east pattern of increasingly warm and dry climates coupled
with more xeric soils associated with low densities. It is im-
portant to note that these findings reflect landscape patterns
of climatic site means, not temporal climatic patterns at in-
dividual sites. For instance, sites with cooler November min-
imum mean temperatures contained the highest densities in
the regression tree (Fig. 3). At an individual site, however,
years with warmer fall temperatures facilitate P. ponderosa
regeneration in this region by helping seedlings that germi-
nate during summer avoid frost kill (Pearson 1923).
Elevation and tree density were not strongly related, even
though plots spanned a 643 m elevational range. For exam-
ple, the highest-elevation plot of 2564 m, still well within
the P. ponderosa elevation belt in this region, received the
third most precipitation (733 mm/year) modeled by PRISM
but contained the sixth lowest density of 14 trees/ha among
sites. Conversely, the sites lowest in elevation (<2011 m)
exhibited medium densities of 48–56 trees/ha. Many other
plots of nearly equivalent elevation had densities that dif-
fered substantially, suggesting that soil properties, other cli-
matic gradients, and other variables affected tree recruitment
more than elevation did.
Other factors: understory vegetation and fire
Competition with grasses has been cited as a major factor
limiting
P.
ponderosa
seedling
establishment
(Pearson
1942). Therefore, sites with high grass cover could be antici-
pated to support low tree densities. We found that some sites
with silty, moist, N-rich soils, likely optimal for tree growth,
had low tree densities. We hypothesize that grass cover was
highest historically on these sites, especially of F. arizonica
(the
most
competitive
bunchgrass
with
P.
ponderosa;
Pearson 1942), and limited tree regeneration. In contrast, on
dry, nutrient-poor sites both understory vegetation and tree
recruitment were likely limited. Therefore, we suspect that
understory cover had a bell-shaped relationship with tree
density, where sites with intermediate levels of understory
vegetation supported the highest tree densities. This hypoth-
esis is difficult to test because of limited quantitative data on
understories in historical forests, although insight may be
gained through contemporary experiments that manipulate

understory vegetation and include fire to simulate the histor-
ical environment.
Historical fire regimes in P. ponderosa forests have not
been compared among ecosystem types. However, five fire-
history studies conducted at specific sites within different
parts of the study area reported similar historical fire-return
intervals of 2–5 years (Van Horne and Fule´ 2006). These
studies included one site each in at least the xeric limestone,
mesic limestone, and mesic basalt ecosystems examined in
this study. It is unclear whether fire regimes differed in the
other ecosystems, such as the black cinder type where sparse
fuel may have limited fire spread. If fire regimes differed
among ecosystems, this variation could have influenced tree
density and pattern directly by creating safe sites for regen-
eration (White 1985) or killing young trees, or indirectly
through fire effects on understory vegetation and soils. Al-
ternatively, fire regimes may have been a relatively consis-
tent influence across the landscape, making variation in
soils and other factors more important. Reconstructing his-
torical fire regimes across the landscape and among ecosys-
tem types, as was done here for tree structure, may yield
valuable insight into presettlement forest patterns.
Regional comparisons
Previous individual site studies of historical P. ponderosa
density in the study area have reported densities similar to
those that we recorded on ecosystem types measured in
both this study and earlier studies. For example, Menzel
and Covington (1997) found a density of 54 trees/ha in the
eastern part of the study area in Walnut Canyon of the xeric
limestone ecosystem. We recorded 57 trees/ha near Walnut
Canyon and a range of 16–58 trees/ha in all six sample sites
of xeric limestone. Covington and Moore (1994) and Mast
et al. (1999) reported densities of 56 and 60 trees/ha, respec-
tively, in the mesic basalt ecosystem, both which are within
the range of 39–143 trees/ha that we found for the diverse
sites of this type. At two sites in each of three ecosystem
types, Sa´nchez Meador et al. (2009) reported the following
densities in relation to our results: mixed igneous ecosys-
tem — 77–80 trees/ha (14–81 trees/ha in our study); mesic
basalt — 44–67 (39–143); and rocky basalt — 96–126 (53–
114). By using a landscape-scale perspective and including a
variety of ecosystem types not previously examined (e.g.,
clay basalt with 0–19 trees/ha), our study illuminated the
variability in density across the landscape and areas that
contained sharply lower or higher densities than had been
previously reported for this landscape.
Based on comparing the range in density among our 53
sample sites (0–183 trees/ha) with densities reported from
nearby regions, there is as much variation in density within
our study landscape as there is among landscapes. On the
South and North Rim of the Grand Canyon in northern Ari-
zona, Fule´ et al. (2002), for instance, reported a historical
P. ponderosa density of 64–156 trees/ha among six sites.
North of the Grand Canyon near Mount Trumbull, Waltz et
al. (2003) recorded 14–65 trees/ha at four sites spanning
three soil types (basalt–cinder). The density ranges over-
lapped among landscapes, and none of the differences be-
tween landscapes were greater than the range we found
within our study landscape.
Management implications and conclusion
Forest management and restoration benefit from an under-
standing of reference conditions, which enable useful bench-
mark comparisons even when managing forest trajectories to
resemble those benchmarks is not desired (Swetnam et al.
1999). Although there were exceptions to the general pat-
terns of variation in historical P. ponderosa density and spa-
tial arrangement among ecosystem types, we found the
ecosystem classification to be a useful framework for sum-
marizing spatial variation across the landscape. Different
ecosystem types that typically exhibit higher or lower den-
sities were able to be identified, providing managers with
estimates of anticipated tree densities across the landscape.
Furthermore, this analysis identified an ecosystem (black
cinder) that consistently exhibited a random tree distribu-
tion,
deviating
from
the
commonly
held
view
of
P. ponderosa forests as being clumped. Analyzing variation
at many sites across the landscape specifically permitted the
identification of exceptions to the typical density and spatial
patterns previously described for these forests. The ecosys-
tem classification already exists as a map, and future re-
search could refine density and pattern estimates to map
these variables across the landscape. Examining continuous
variation in density and pattern along measured environmen-
tal gradients helped to identify factors (e.g., soil texture) that
could have resulted in the observed variation among ecosys-
tem types. Future experimental research could seek to deter-
mine precise mechanisms associated with the observed
variation, in combination with further research on historical
conditions (e.g., fire regimes) that may have been associated
with observed patterns. As tree thinning is increasingly im-
plemented to reduce hazardous fuels and deleterious ecolog-
ical
conditions
in
western
North
American
forests,
landscape-scale assessments of reference and current condi-
tions are increasingly valuable tools for understanding heter-
ogeneity over the vast areas on which forest management is
needed.
