Abstract
The recent mortality of up to 20% of forests and woodlands in the southwestern United States, along with declining stream
flows and projected future water shortages, heightens the need to understand how management practices can enhance
forest resilience and functioning under unprecedented scales of drought and wildfire. To address this challenge, a
combination of mechanical thinning and fire treatments are planned for 238,000 hectares (588,000 acres) of ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa) forests across central Arizona, USA. Mechanical thinning can increase runoff at fine scales, as well as
reduce fire risk and tree water stress during drought, but the effects of this practice have not been studied at scales
commensurate with recent forest disturbances or under a highly variable climate. Modifying a historical runoff model, we
constructed scenarios to estimate increases in runoff from thinning ponderosa pine at the landscape and watershed scales
based on driving variables: pace, extent and intensity of forest treatments and variability in winter precipitation. We found
that runoff on thinned forests was about 20% greater than unthinned forests, regardless of whether treatments occurred in
a drought or pluvial period. The magnitude of this increase is similar to observed declines in snowpack for the region,
suggesting that accelerated thinning may lessen runoff losses due to warming effects. Gains in runoff were temporary (six
years after treatment) and modest when compared to mean annual runoff from the study watersheds (0–3%). Nonetheless
gains observed during drought periods could play a role in augmenting river flows on a seasonal basis, improving
conditions for water-dependent natural resources, as well as benefit water supplies for downstream communities. Results of
this study and others suggest that accelerated forest thinning at large scales could improve the water balance and resilience
of forests and sustain the ecosystem services they provide.

Introduction
As we transition into a warmer century, managing forests in the
southwestern United States for resilience is more urgent and
necessary than ever. Forest conditions across the region have
declined significantly. In ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests
of central Arizona, stand densities range from 2 to 44 times greater
than during pre-settlement conditions and total basal areas range
from 2 to 4 times greater [1–3]. Severe wildfires and drought have
caused high tree mortality rates across 14–18% of forests and
woodlands in Arizona and New Mexico [4] and these results do
not include mortality from two high-severity wildfires in 2011, the
Wallow and the Las Conchas wildfires, which burned 217,000 and
63,500 ha (535,000 and 157,000 acres) in Arizona and New
Mexico, respectively. Persistent drought conditions have also
adversely impacted water-dependent habitats and species within
and downstream of forest uplands, as evidenced by heightened
mortality of a riparian tree species in central Arizona [5] and
declines in number of species and densities of native fish in the
Gila River in southwestern New Mexico [6], [7]. Researchers
suggest that warming is amplifying the size and severity of wildfire-
and drought-mortality events and decreasing snow pack levels [8–
11]. Suggested mechanisms involve changes in the water cycle:
increased evapotranspiration losses, extended water-stress periods,
earlier snowmelt, and lengthened fire seasons. These changes and
trends suggest a widespread drying of forests and an increasing risk
of uncharacteristic fire and competition-induced water stress and
mortality.
At the same time, many communities in the western U.S. are
facing critical water shortages and river flows in some basins have
diminished or been lost altogether due to unsustainable water
management practices [12–15]. Recent studies at the scale of both
the Colorado River basin and the state of Arizona concluded that
water supplies for many communities will be inadequate to meet

future projected demands [16],[17]. Moreover, elevated temper-
atures are predicted to directly impact river flows. A recent study
estimated that for every one-degree Celsius rise in temperature,
Colorado river flows will decline by 3–10% [18].
In this study, we explored the ways in which a new era of forest
management, including accelerating the pace and scale of forest
thinning, could be used to address declining conditions in forests in
central and northern Arizona. At about 6,000 hectares per year
(15,000 acres/year), the current pace of mechanical thinning in
these forests does not begin to match the magnitude of recent
forest disturbances. However, a new congressionally funded
program called the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (hereafter
‘‘4FRI’’) will accelerate the use of mechanical thinning and
prescribed burns across four national forests, treating 238,000 ha
(588,000 acres) in the first analysis area over the next 10 years.
The objective of the 4FRI project is ‘‘…to re-establish forest
structure, pattern, and composition, which would lead to increases
in forest resiliency and function,’’ including reductions in fire risk
and improved watershed function [19]. Mechanical thinning alone
or in combination with prescribed fires reduced fire risk, increased
runoff, and improved tree water-stress at the plot scale [20–23].
The 4FRI project provided the opportunity to evaluate the
effectiveness of forest thinning to improve forest resilience and
ecosystem functioning at larger scales.
The objectives of this study were to: (1) investigate how variation
in climate and the pace and extent of thinning of ponderosa pine
forests affects runoff in the Salt and Verde watersheds of central
Arizona; and (2) explore the management implications of using
accelerated thinning to improve forest resilience in a time of
declining forest and water conditions. We chose the Salt-Verde
watersheds because forests from these watersheds provide water
for 1.5 million people in Phoenix, which is the 6th largest city in
the United States. We focused on ponderosa pine because this
forest type produces 50% of the runoff in these watersheds even
though it accounts for only 20% of the area [24]. We modified a
forest runoff model developed from historical paired watershed
experiments in the Beaver Creek sub-watershed within our study
area [20] and ran the model in multiple scenarios to estimate
additional annual runoff from mechanical thinning. The scenarios
simulated forest treatment at two scales (a) landscape-scale
thinning planned within the first analysis area of the 4FRI project
and (b) watershed-scale thinning in forests across the Salt-Verde
watersheds (Figure 1). Scenarios were designed to account for
variability in winter precipitation, as well as the pace and extent of
forest treatments. We estimated runoff in periods with below-
average precipitation, herein referred to as droughts, and in
periods with above-average precipitation, herein referred to as
pluvials, using a model of 20th century precipitation in ponderosa
pine forests in the region [25]. We believe this is the first attempt to
estimate the influence of mechanical thinning on runoff over
multi-year broad-scale restoration projects that accounts for the
effects of climate variability.
Materials and Methods
The subsequent sections provide detailed information on the
study area, the development of the modified runoff model, the
method we used to simulate variability in winter precipitation, the
4FRI runoff scenarios, and the Salt-Verde runoff scenarios. All
statistical analyses and graphics were completed using the
statistical software SigmaPlot 11 (Systat software Inc, San Jose,
CA), except for regression model fitting which was performed
using Matlab 2013 (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Methods and results
are reported in SI units, but for accessibility to forest and water
managers, we reported English units in parentheses within the text
and included all study figures and tables in English units as File S1.
Area and water volume amounts were rounded off to three
significant figures.
Study Area
Ponderosa pine forests occupy approximately 0.68 million ha
(1.68 million acres) of the 3.46 million ha (8.56 million acres)
within the Salt-Verde watersheds in central Arizona (Figure 1). A
portion of these forests, all within the Verde watershed, will be
mechanically thinned in the 4FRI project in the next 10 years.
Within the Salt-Verde watersheds, ponderosa pine forests grow at
mid-elevations, from 1,800 to 2,600 m (5,900–8,600 feet) [26],
[27], on soils derived from basalt (59%) and sedimentary rock
(41%) [28]. Mean annual precipitation for ponderosa forests in the
southwestern United States ranges from 510 to 760 mm (20 to 30
inches) and is highly variable [29]. Sixty percent of annual
precipitation falls primarily as snow in the winter and spring
months from October to April, and the melting of the resulting
snowpack accounts for 80 to 90% of annual stream flow [29].
Forest Treatment Runoff Model
For the purposes of this study, we were interested in estimating
the additional runoff that becomes available due to forest thinning
on an annual basis, not absolute values of watershed runoff. We
define ‘‘additional runoff due to thinning’’ as the portion of
precipitation that appears as surface water at the sub-watershed
outlet and that is directly attributable to mechanical thinning
treatments. This additional runoff can be considered as ‘‘in-place’’
or ‘‘in-situ’’ as we did not attempt to model runoff accumulation,
routing, groundwater outflows or inflows, or channel losses in
downstream watersheds.
We modified the Baker-Kovner logistical regression equation
from the historical Beaver Creek sub-watershed experiments to
calculate annual runoff in our study [20]. We selected this model
because the Beaver Creek sub-watershed is actually within our
study area (Figure 1), and because the model was based upon
measured empirical data. These experiments and others like it
demonstrated that reductions in forest basal area of 30–100% in
ponderosa forests on basalt-derived soils increased runoff between
15–40% for up to six years after the initial treatment [29]. Runoff
increases were negligible for basal area reductions below 30%, six
years after treatments, and for years with winter precipitation
below 230 mm (9 inches) [20], [29]. The original model predicted
annual watershed runoff based on three independent variables:
winter precipitation (Oct-Apr), forest basal area, and a solar
insolation index, and explained a fair amount of variability in total
watershed runoff [20].
To derive increases in runoff directly associated with thinning
using the paired watershed method, researchers in the Beaver
Creek experiments first established a relationship between stream
flows in the control and treated watersheds before treatments [30].
This relationship was used to predict what would have been
baseline flows in the treated watershed. The difference between
measured flows in the treated watershed and this predicted value
were attributed to thinning effects. We compared data calculated
in this fashion in the Beaver Creek experiments [30], [31] and one
additional nearby site, Castle Creek [32], to output generated by
the Baker-Kovner model. The output from the model was
calculated as the difference in post-treatment and pre-treatment
watershed runoff using post- and pre-treatment basal areas
respectively and holding all other variables constant. In this
comparison, we found the fit of the model output to the portion of
runoff due to thinning to be much poorer (r2 = 0.43, Figure 2a)

than model fit to total watershed runoff (r2 = 0.69). We concluded
that the original regression model was relatively insensitive to the
direct effects of forest treatments, including time since treatment,
on runoff.
We used a stepwise regression procedure to develop a revised
model, beginning with an initial model that included the
independent variables (winter precipitation and basal area) that
were found to be significant in historical experiments [20]. Input
data for all independent variables used to develop the model were
derived from empirical data collected during the Beaver Creek
and Castle Creek historical experiments and archived in databases
or published reports [30–32]. We added independent variables
and used an F-test to test the null hypothesis that the coefficient of
each term was zero at the 95% significance level. To ensure that
the model was not over-fitted, we repeated the stepwise regression
procedure with 70% of the original data, selected randomly. We
determined that the structure of the model did not change and
provided a good fit to the remaining 30% of the data. We
examined the residuals from the model and found no discernible
patterns of dispersion or bias. Including terms for slope, percent of
watershed area with a south-facing aspect, and mean, minimum,
and maximum winter temperatures did not significantly improve
the model.
The final model included three terms: winter precipitation, an
interaction term between winter precipitation and years since
treatment, and an interaction term between winter precipitation
and basal area. It can be expressed as:
Rtreatment~{28:464z0:148 ! P{0:015 ! P ! Y{

Figure 2b shows that the revised model explained more of the
variability in predicting additional runoff associated with forest
treatments (r2 = 0.67) than did the original model. The model
predicted runoff increases in a linear fashion with winter
precipitation and basal area reductions, and decreases linearly

with years since treatment (Figure 3). To compare the original and
modified Baker-Kovner models in English Units, see File S2.
We did use the original Baker-Kovner regression equation in
this study to calculate total watershed runoff for forests in their
current condition so that we could estimate the percentage
increase in runoff associated with treatments. For these calcula-
tions, we used the average value for the solar insolation index,
r = 0.7, reported from the Beaver Creek experiments [20]. In a
sensitivity analysis, we found that calculating absolute runoff based
on the low (r = 0.66) and high values (r = 0.74) of this index
changed the estimated increase from treatments by only 1–2
percentage points.
Winter Precipitation
In order to account for inter-annual and decadal variability of
winter precipitation, we used the PRISM model [25] to extract
pluvials and droughts from the 20th century and inserted levels of
winter precipitation from these periods into our runoff scenarios.
We first extracted total winter precipitation, summed across
October to April, for every year from 1900–2012 from the PRISM
modeled dataset [25] across 2 scales: (a) ponderosa pine forests
within the Verde watershed and (b) these forests within the Salt-
Verde watersheds. We selected these geographies to be most
representative of conditions for the 4FRI and Salt-Verde runoff
scenarios, respectively. From 1900–2012, mean winter precipita-
tion in Verde ponderosa pine forests was 394 mm (15.5 inches)
with a range of 99–815 mm (3.9–32.1 inches) (Figure 4). For Salt-
Verde forests, the mean was 368 mm (14.5 inches) and the range
was 89–747 mm (3.5–29.4 inches) for this same period of time.
To test the accuracy of these modeled data, we compared values
from the Verde ponderosa pine PRISM modeled data to
measurements of total winter precipitation recorded during the
original Beaver Creek experiments [31]. Given that we found the
distribution of the data to be non-normal, we ran the non-
parametric Spearman’s rank order correlation. We found a strong
association between modeled and observed data (Rho = 0.9577,
p,0.001) although the model underestimated measured winter
precipitation over the time period by approximately 25 mm (1
inch) and consistently under-estimated precipitation in wet winters
(Figure 4 inset).
We calculated mean winter precipitation across 15-, 25-, and
35-year periods from this modeled data and used this information
to select droughts and pluvials. For each scenario, we moved the
start and end years that thinning was simulated to occur. For
example, time periods for our 15-year scenarios included 1944–
1958, 1945–1959, and 1946–1960 (examples illustrated as shaded
areas in Figure 4). Using this method, we found two instances of
pluvials – early 20th century and late 1970s to late-1990s – and two
droughts – during the 1950s and the current drought.
Estimating runoff from 4FRI project
We used the modified regression model to calculate additional
annual runoff from individual forests stands that will be thinned in
the first analysis area of the 4FRI project, established an annual
thinning schedule, and then summed increases in runoff from
individual stands across treatment years. We ran a total of 26
scenarios where in each scenario we inserted a different 15-year
winter precipitation sequence.
We obtained a Geographic Information System (GIS) dataset of
alternative C in the draft environmental impact statement for the
first analysis area of the 4FRI project [19]. For each stand to be
mechanically thinned, this dataset contained estimates of current
basal areas and desired post-treatment basal areas. Forest
prescriptions for ‘‘group-selection’’ stands called for two post-
treatment basal areas, one for ‘‘open’’ areas that would be evenly
thinned and another for ‘‘group’’ areas where thinning would be
minimal to enhance wildlife habitats by retaining greater tree
densities. For these stands, we calculated a post-treatment basal
area that was an average of these two basal areas, weighted by the
proportional area of the open and group areas. We selected 4,064
ponderosa pine stands within the Verde watershed slated for
mechanical thinning, where the prescription will reduce basal
areas by at least 30%. They ranged in size from 0.4 to 217 ha (1 to
536 acres), for a total of 61,900 ha (153,000 acres). The
prescriptions within these stands called for reductions of basal
area between 30% and 70% with a mean reduction of 48%
(Figure 5).
Based on consultation with US Forest Service staff, we found
that it was reasonable to assume that an equal number of hectares
will be mechanically thinned every year across the 10-year
treatment period. So for the purposes of our 4FRI scenarios, we
assigned each of these stands to one of ten cohorts until the area of
each cohort equaled 1/10th of total area or approximately 6,190
ha (15,300 acres). Figure 6a illustrates the treatment schedule for
Figure 2. Comparison of models to observed runoff. Fit of (a) original [20] and (b) modified Baker-Kovner regression model output to increases

the 15-year 4FRI scenarios reported in this study. Cohorts were
treated consecutively in the first 10 years and it was assumed that
cohorts influenced runoff for 6 years. So, for example, stands
treated in cohort 1, contributed to additional runoff in scenario
years 1-6 and stands treated in cohort 10 contributed from years
10–15.
We calculated additional runoff associated with thinning and
total watershed runoff by inserting values of the independent
variables into the revised and original Baker-Kovner regression
models, respectively. Pre-treatment and post-treatment basal area
values were derived from the 4FRI stand data. Years since
treatment ranged from y = 0 to 5. As described previously, winter
precipitation values were droughts and pluvials drawn from the
PRISM model for ponderosa forests in the Verde watershed. We
set runoff increase to zero in years when winter precipitation was
less than 230 mm (9 inches). We transformed the unit of runoff
from mm to volume (million m3) using the area of each stand. We
estimated annual increases in runoff at the landscape scale by
summing stand level amounts for each scenario year, and
calculated summary statistics (mean, median, max, cumulative)
that allowed for a comparison of scenarios.
Estimating runoff from Salt-Verde watersheds
Unlike the first analysis area of the 4FRI project, there was not a
planned forest restoration project across the larger geography of
the Salt-Verde watersheds. We developed a range of estimates for
the extent, pace, and intensity of forest thinning that could be
conducted over this larger geography, grouped these estimates into
runoff scenarios, and ran the scenarios using the revised and
original regression models to estimate additional runoff from
treatments and total watershed runoff. To estimate the potential
areal extent of thinning, we subtracted from the total forested
areas those land uses that are typically considered unsuitable for
mechanical thinning. We bracketed this initial area estimate with
lower values to account for the lack of comprehensive spatial
information. Assuming that the pace of treatments at this scale
could take longer, we constructed 15-, 25-, and 35-year runoff
scenarios. Finally, we assumed that the intensity of forest thinning
at this scale would be similar to the range of basal area reductions
planned for the first analysis are of the 4FRI project. The
remaining parts of this section describe these steps in greater
detail.
Based on a methodology developed in a previous study that
estimated wood supply on four National Forests in northern
Arizona [33], we subtracted from the total area of ponderosa pine
in the watersheds – 0.68 million ha (1.68 million acres) – those
areas that are typically excluded from mechanical thinning
projects due to steepness, restrictions in land management,
previous treatments, or considerations of soil, habitat, or wildlife
conditions (Table 1). We adopted 6 of the 7 ‘‘exclusion’’ criteria
from that study and added one additional factor. We removed one
criterion – Northern goshawk nest areas –because the mean basal
area reduction for these areas in the 4FRI project was greater than
30% [19] suggesting that thinning in these areas could result in
additional runoff based on the results of the Beaver Creek
experiments [20]. We added one criterion – high severity burn
patches – because a nearby study on the recovery of ponderosa
pine forests after wildfire demonstrated that mature forests suitable
for thinning would not likely develop in areas that had burned with
high severity within the timeframe of this study [34]. While two of
the three 4FRI prescriptions for Mexican Spotted Owl Protected
Activity Centers (MSO PAC) would result in negligible changes in
basal area, one would allow for basal area reductions greater than
30% [19]. However, we were not able to differentiate among these
prescriptions from the data we obtained, so we opted for a
conservative estimate for this factor by excluding MSO PAC areas
from our analysis. Compiling the publicly available geospatial data

for these factors [26], [27], [33], [35–38], we found that 401,000
ha (992,000 acres), or 59% of ponderosa pine forests, were
available for mechanical thinning after accounting for these
exclusion areas. The percentage of forests excluded in this estimate
– 41% – compared favorably with the average of 37% of forests
that were excluded in dozens of restoration projects evaluated in
the northern Arizona [33]. We bracketed this high estimate with a
moderate estimate – 45% or 301,000 ha (743,000 acres) – and a
low estimate – 30% or 204,000 ha (505,000 acres) – because
quantitative geo-spatial data on some exclusion areas was missing
or incomplete. As illustrated graphically for the moderate estimate
in Figure 6b-d, we divided these areas into 10-, 20-, and 30-year
treatment cohorts assuming that equal areas would be thinned
every year.
We scaled up the forest condition information contained in the
4FRI stand data using a proportion metric, assuming that these
stands were representative of stand-level forest conditions across
the Salt-Verde watersheds. For example, 4FRI stands that
comprised 1,500-ha in a 15,000-ha 4FRI treatment cohort were
estimated to be 3,000-ha in a 30,000-ha Salt-Verde cohort. If the
thinning prescription for these stands called for a reduction in
basal area from 33 to 17 m2/ha, then the Salt-Verde scenarios
calculated additional runoff from 3,000-ha that are thinned from
33 to 17 m2/ha. After scaling up the area of each stand to the
watershed scale, the procedure for estimating runoff in the Salt-
Verde scenarios was the same as described for the 4FRI scenarios.
We ran 147 scenarios in total, 67 fifteen-year, 52 twenty-five year,
and 28 thirty-five year scenarios.
Results
Four Forest Restoration Initiative Runoff Scenarios
Mechanical thinning of ponderosa pine forests in the first
analysis area of the 4FRI project – 6,190 ha/year for ten
years totaling 61,900 ha (15,300 ac/year; 153,000 acres total)
– increased mean annual runoff from 3.13 million m3 (2,540 acre-
feet) in a simulated drought to 7.27 million m3 (5,890 acre-feet) in
a pluvial. Differences in winter precipitation over the 15-year
simulation periods significantly influenced runoff gains. A differ-
ence in mean winter precipitation of only 130 mm (5 inches), from
330 mm (13 inches) in drought scenario to 460 mm (18 inches) in
a pluvial scenario, resulted in a doubling of the annual increase in
runoff from treatments (Figure 7).
Inter-annual variability in winter precipitation was also impor-
tant. Figure 8 illustrates year to year increases in runoff for those
scenarios that resulted in the lowest and highest gains in runoff.
Years with high winter precipitation played a disproportionate role
in additional runoff in both droughts and pluvials. In the majority
of scenarios ran (15 out of 26), winter precipitation from only 5 of
the 15 years accounted for at least 75% of the increased runoff.
Cumulative increases in runoff across 15-year periods resulted in a
total increase from 54.3 to 111 million m3 (44,000–89,800 acre-
feet) (Figure 9). Runoff from thinned forests was approximately
20% greater than unthinned forests (as estimated using original
Baker-Kovner regression model) in both droughts and pluvials
(data not shown).

Salt-Verde Runoff Scenarios
Depending on winter precipitation and the forest treatment
schedule, mean annual increases in runoff from thinning of
ponderosa forests across the Salt-Verde watersheds ranged from
4.76 to 15.0 million m3 (3,860–12,200 acre-feet) over a 35-year
treatment period, 6.18 to 23.4 million m3 (5,010 to 19,000 acre-
feet) over 25 years, and 9.23 to 42.8 million m3 (7,480 to 34,700
acre-feet) over 15 years (Table 2). Similar to the 4FRI scenarios,
additional runoff in the Salt-Verde watersheds was 1.6–2.3 times
greater in pluvials than in droughts. Regardless of whether the
scenarios occurred in a drought or pluvial, cumulative runoff gains
in thinned forests were 20-26% greater than unthinned forests.
Cumulative gains ranged from 167 to 525 million m3 (135,000–
426,000 acre-feet) in the 35-year scenarios, 154 to 585 million m3
(125,000–474,000 acre-feet) in 25-year scenarios, and 138 to 643
million m3 (112,000–521,000 acre-feet) in 15-year scenarios. In
both droughts and pluvials, runoff increased in a positive linear
fashion with increases in the pace and the extent of forest thinning

units.
Discussion
This study demonstrated that the pace, extent, and intensity of
forest thinning that is planned under the first analysis area of 4FRI
and at larger scales could measurably increase runoff in ponderosa
pine forests in central Arizona. Modeled runoff from thinned
forests
was
approximately
20%
greater
than
runoff
from
unthinned forests which is within the range of 10–40% increases
in runoff demonstrated in the Beaver Creek experiments [20],
[29]. The Salt-Verde runoff scenarios showed that levels of

additional runoff increased proportionally with increases in the
pace and extent of thinning. Runoff gains occurred in droughts
and pluvials, a surprising outcome that underscored the impor-
tance of inter-annual and decadal variability in precipitation.
These increases in runoff would likely improve conditions for
water-dependent natural resources, such as cienegas, riparian
areas, and aquatic habitats, which are vulnerable to low flows that
are experienced seasonally, especially in summer months, and also
during droughts [5–7]. Runoff gains also could provide incidental
benefits to the water supply of downstream users, but the increases
were more modest when compared to total runoff from the Salt-
Verde watersheds. They would comprise a 0–3% increase from
mean annual surface flows from the Salt-Verde rivers of 1.39
billion m3 (1.13 million acre-feet) and approximately a 1-9%
increase of Salt-Verde flows supplied to municipal users in the
Phoenix Metro Area on an annual basis [39].
Consistent with the historical experiments, thinning effects on
runoff were temporary in this study. Additional runoff would cease
six years after the multi-year thinning schedules in our scenarios.
Beaver Creek investigators speculated that thinning effects were
short-lived because of subsequent regrowth of understory species
[29]. We note that prescribed fires are planned as subsequent
treatments for all stands that are initially thinned within the first
analysis area of 4FRI [19]. These maintenance treatments should
provide additional information as to how effective subsequent
actions are in terms of removing understory vegetation and
sustaining runoff gains.
Our study adds to previous research on the potential for
increases in runoff associated with thinning of ponderosa pine
forests in the Southwest. Using a simulation model, Brown and
Fogel [40] found that thinning approximately 9,300 ha (23,000
acres) of ponderosa pine per year over a 10-year period produced
increases in runoff that ranged from 0.28 to 11.8 million m3/year
(230–9,600 acre-feet/year). This range overlapped with but was

lower than the 6.18 to 11.9 million m3/year (5,010–9,660 acre-
feet/year) increases in runoff for the two Salt-Verde runoff
scenarios with annual thinning of approximately 10,000 ha
(25,000 acres) (Table 2). One potential reason for this difference
was that Brown and Fogel [40] modeled the treatment-runoff
relationship to be constant over time, 18 mm (0.71 inches), and
did not evaluate variability in precipitation but instead assumed
average winter precipitation of 396 mm (15.6 inches). Using
similar values for winter precipitation and basal area reduction,
our model simulated the runoff response to vary depending on
years since treatment, from a high of 38 mm (1.5 inches) in the
year immediately following treatments to a low approaching zero
mm after six years (Figure 3c).
Study Limitations
In this study, we revised a statistical runoff model from the
historical Beaver Creek watershed experiments to explore how
variations in climate and forest thinning would affect runoff. To
the extent possible, we limited the application of the runoff model
to the range of climatic and environmental conditions under which
the original data were collected and model developed. However,
our modeling approach was constrained by several uncertainties
that will require further investigation. The model was limited by
the scope of forest practices conducted in the Beaver Creek
watershed experiments [20], [30–32]. These experiments used
thinning techniques such as strip-thinning and patch clearing that
had a similar range of basal area reductions but a different spatial
configuration from contemporary thinning prescriptions. They did
not measure the effects of maintenance treatments on runoff. They
measured ‘‘in-place’’ runoff at sub-watershed outlets and did not
measure other aspects of the water budget, such as evapotrans-
piration, soil moisture, surface routing, and groundwater recharge.
The revised model represented statistical relationships between
annual runoff and winter precipitation, forest basal area reductions
and time since treatment, but these relationships were not
necessarily related to physical processes or functions that control
water balance [20]. We summarized how important factors that
are not directly modeled may increase or decrease the range or
runoff due to thinning that is documented in this study in File S3.
Of all the factors where uncertainties in forest hydrology and
runoff remain, perhaps the most significant were the effects of soil
types, long-term climate variability, and climate change. In terms of
soil types, the revised regression model in this study was derived from
experimental thinning on basalt-derived soils that support 59% of
ponderosa pine forests in the Salt-Verde watersheds. The runoff
effects of thinning on the remaining 41% of forests on sedimentary-
derived soils are unknown. Two studies demonstrated that runoff
from untreated ponderosa forests on sedimentary-derived soils can be

substantially less than runoff from volcanic soils [41], [42].
Several properties of sedimentary-derived soils relative to basalt-
derived soils may lead to greater water permeability and
infiltration, including lower clay content, extensive fracturing,
and deeper soil horizons [30], [43], [44]. Depending on a
number of factors, increased infiltration may lead to increased
recharge,
which
we
would
expect
to
result
in
increased
discharge to surface water at some location downstream.
A nearby paired-watershed study in mixed conifer forests on
sedimentary-derived soils found that overstory removal of 30-80%
led to a slightly higher range of increased runoff, 30–110%, that
persisted for more years than the Beaver Creek experiments
[45],[46]. Direct comparisons with ponderosa pine forests are not
possible because this study was conducted within a higher-
elevation mixed-conifer forest that had higher initial basal areas
and higher mean annual precipitation.
Relative to climate, this study’s scenarios captured the high end
of variability associated with pluvials but probably not the low end
of variability associated with droughts. Specifically, the early 20th
century pluvial may have been the wettest pluvial that has
occurred in the last 12 centuries [47], whereas the two occurrences
of 20th century drought were eclipsed in terms of duration and
severity
by
several
multi-decade
‘‘mega-droughts’’
[48–51].
Output from global circulation models indicates that climate
variability will continue to be an important characteristic of the
region in the future [52], but that climate change may increase the
risk of extreme climatic events such as multi-decade droughts and
extreme winter precipitation [53], [54]. Some global circulation
models also project that mean winter precipitation in the
Southwest will decline by up to 10% [52], but it may take many
years to detect effects on stream flows because of precipitation
variability [55]. The net effect of changes in precipitation on forest
condition and hydrology still needs to be resolved and will require
more investigation.
Unlike precipitation, the effects of anthropogenic warming on
forest hydrology are clearer. Studies have found that warmer
temperatures in recent decades help explain a downward trend in
snowpack in the western United States, even after patterns of
natural climate variability have been considered [9], [56]. In our
revision of the historical runoff model, we attempted to add several
parameters of temperature – seasonal means, maximums, and
minimums – as explanatory variables to the revised regression
model but none were significant. This suggests that the temporal
and spatial range of winter temperatures that occurred during the
years when the watershed experiments were conducted was not
sufficient to add explanatory value to predicting runoff. In a
separate trend analysis of winter temperatures (Oct-Apr), we found
that temperatures in the months of March and April in the last 25
years, 1988–2012, were significantly warmer by 2 and 1 degrees
Celsius
(3.5
and
2
degrees
Fahrenheit),
respectively,
than
temperatures for the same months in the 25 years when the
experiments were conducted, 1958–1982 (see File S4 for more
detailed information). The magnitude of observed declines in
snowpack in the Southwest, in the range of 20%, is similar to the
increases in runoff associated with thinning from this study,
suggesting that accelerated thinning may at least offset or
ameliorate runoff losses due to climate change.
Management Implications: Accelerated Forest Thinning
to Improve Resilience
On balance, we believe there is enough evidence for managers
to explore the ways in which accelerated forest thinning can
restore forest resilience and functioning to ameliorate the drying of
ponderosa
pine
forests
associated
with
warming
and
past
management activities. Below we summarize the management
implications of this and related studies.

1. Maintain & improve ecosystem function – The current
paradigm of forest management has moved away from a debate
about managing forests to address one societal need, such as
downstream water supply, to recognition that management
strategies need to address multiple challenges [29], [57]. The
4FRI restoration project demonstrates this approach with planned
benefits that include ‘‘…improved vegetation biodiversity, wildlife
habitat, soil productivity, and watershed function’’ [19]. The
impaired functioning and heightened vulnerability of southwestern
forests to large-scale disturbances increases the urgency to improve
ecosystem functioning, and to measure the effectiveness and trade-
offs associated with these management activities using robust
adaptive management and monitoring protocols. Such a focus
may result in more options and flexibility in subsequent years,
whereas failure to maintain functioning ecosystems may eliminate
future options if soil and hydrologic processes are irreversibly
altered.
Our study demonstrated that accelerated thinning can improve
surface water runoff, a key ecosystem function, and provided
indirect evidence of benefits for soil moisture and productivity.
Another study found that average soil water content on low density
ponderosa forests (250 trees/ha) was substantially higher than on
high density forests (2,710 trees/ha), although these differences in
forest density were not a result of mechanical thinning [58].
Researchers in the historical Beaver Creek experiments hypoth-
esized that lower tree densities associated with thinning would
reduce evapotranspiration losses, and thereby allow more water to
be available for soil moisture, groundwater recharge, and surface
water runoff [29]. Although we were unable to evaluate thinning
effects on evapotranspiration, Dore et al. [59] found that light
thinning (40% basal area reduction) in a ponderosa pine forest
reduced stand-level evapotranspiration by 12% over four years,
but the effect diminished over time and was not detectable in the
fourth post-harvest year. This same study found that removal of all
trees in a wildfire-burned site reduced annual evapotranspiration
by 20%.
Other studies demonstrated that mechanical thinning can
reduce the vulnerability of forests to uncharacteristic crown fires.
Using a fire simulation model, Cochrane et al. [60] found that
landscape-scale mechanical thinning that preceded actual wildfires
could have reduced the average size of six wildfires in ponderosa
pine and mixed conifer forests in California and the southwestern
United States by an average of 18% (range 0.3 to 65%). A meta-
analysis of 54 experimental studies showed that mechanical
thinning
significantly
reduced
the
susceptibility
of
western
ponderosa and Jeffrey pine forests to crown fires [23]. These
studies describe the primary mechanism by which thinning
reduces fire risk as a redistribution of fuels, thereby reducing fire
spread rates and crowning behavior.
2. Apply management tools at scale – Managing forests at a
scale that is comparable to recent forest disturbances will be
another key factor for improving resilience. At 238,000 ha
(588,000 acres) of ponderosa pine to be treated with mechanical
thinning and prescribed fire, the 4FRI project is approaching the
scale of these amplified disturbances. Our study demonstrated that
potential increases in runoff associated with thinning were scale
dependent: runoff increased in a linear fashion as the pace and
extent of thinning increased in the Salt-Verde runoff scenarios
(Figure 10). Recent efforts to reduce fire risk with landscape-scale
treatments of ponderosa pine forests have been successful. For
example, treatments completed before the largest wildfire in
Arizona history, the Wallow Fire in 2011, effectively protected
communities and towns by reducing fire severity before it reached
key residential areas [61].
Figure 10. Scale effects of thinning on runoff in Salt-Verde watersheds. Effects of increasing (a) pace and (b) extent of thinning treatments
in ponderosa pine forests in Salt-Verde watersheds on increases in mean annual runoff (million m3/year). In (a) total area thinned is held constant at
301,000 ha (743,000 acres) (scenarios: 35mid, 25mid, 15mid) to show influence of increasing the area thinned per year. In (b) duration of thinning
treatments is held constant at 25 years (scenarios: 25low, 25mid, 25high) to show influence of increasing the total area thinned across the scenario. In
order to illustrate scale effects, only increases in mean annual runoff are shown. Statistics describing annual variability in runoff gains are shown in
Table 2 and illustrated graphically for 4FRI scenario in Figure 8.

Further, accelerated thinning may open up opportunities to use
other management tools at an accelerated pace. For example,
wildland fire use has been an effective and inexpensive tool for
maintaining forest resilience across large areas in remote forests
and woodlands – the Gila Wilderness in New Mexico and Grand
Canyon National Park in northern Arizona [62], [63] – but has
been used less frequently in forests near population centers and
towns. Completion of treatments in the first analysis area of the
4FRI project could have a multiplying effect on maintaining forest
resilience if the thinning itself allows for increased use of wildland
fire or prescribed fire over many more hectares.
3. Leverage knowledge of climate variability – The Beaver
Creek watershed experiments and others like it demonstrated that
winter precipitation was the best predictor of additional runoff
from forest thinning [20], [30]. We add to this knowledge by
examining how variability in winter precipitation could influence
management effectiveness. Our scenarios demonstrated that gains
in runoff from thinning could occur even under drought
conditions. In simulated droughts, 1 out of 3 years had above-
average precipitation, and these years accounted for 75% of the
runoff gains in these scenarios. Even though these gains were
substantially less than runoff gains during pluvials, additional
runoff under drought conditions could help lessen the impact of
predicted climate-driven losses in hydrologic connectivity impor-
tant to native fish in the Salt and Verde watersheds [64].
This study also demonstrated that the same thinning schedule
could result in a doubling in additional runoff if conducted in a
pluvial typical of 20th century variability as compared to a
drought. Scientists have developed decision support tools to help
managers understand the likelihood that precipitation regimes
will shift from wet to dry conditions or vice-versa [65], [66].
Knowledge of whether management activities are taking place in a
pluvial or a drought could improve the ability of managers to
predict the likelihood of success for various objectives. For
example, thinning in a pluvial might meet substantive objectives
to improve runoff, whereas thinning in a drought might be more
significant for reducing risks of catastrophic crown fires or drought
mortality.
With the notable exception of a mega-drought, the droughts
and pluvials examined in this study were characteristic of climate
variability in the region. An examination of hydro-climatic trends
in the Salt-Verde watersheds revealed that temperatures are non-
stationary, increasing significantly in recent decades, but the same
is not true for winter precipitation or resulting stream flows [55].
Rather, winter precipitation has fluctuated between droughts and
pluvials in these watersheds in the last century with no evidence of
directional
change,
a
pattern
that
has
reoccurred
in
the
southwestern United States for the last 1000 years [50]. These
precipitation cycles have been linked to persistent anomalies in sea
surface temperatures that vary across inter-annual and decadal
time steps [67], [68]. If past patterns of precipitation variability
remain stable in the near term, then it is probable that
precipitation and flows in the Salt-Verde watersheds will shift
into wetter conditions within the timeframe examined in this study
[66].
4. Building Knowledge to Reduce Uncertainties – Landscape-
scale restoration projects like 4FRI present the opportunity to
learn about the influence of accelerated thinning on forest water
budgets and resilience using modern forestry techniques and under
a changing and variable climate. Stakeholders in the 4FRI project
are developing a robust adaptive management and monitoring
program so that progress towards objectives can be measured and
timely adjustments to management made. Additionally, a paired-
watershed experiment to evaluate the effects of forest treatments,
including prescribed fire maintenance treatments, on watershed
properties is planned within the first analysis area of 4FRI. It will
monitor runoff, precipitation, evapotranspiration, snow water
storage, soil moisture, groundwater recharge, and sediment yield,
thereby reducing our knowledge gaps regarding the effects of
forest management on the water cycle.
Conclusions
The
widespread
pattern
of
forest
drying,
evidenced
by
ecosystem level moisture deficits and larger and more severe
wildfires,
indicates
we
are
entering
a
new
era
of
forest
management. The 4FRI project is an example of a restoration
effort that is addressing this challenge in two ways: establishing
objectives to improve resilience and increasing the scale at which
management tools are applied. Our study demonstrated that this
type of project can increase runoff by approximately 20%
compared to unthinned forests, even under simulated drought
conditions. If treatments at this scale are completed and repeated
over the next several decades, increases in runoff could help offset
the current and projected declines in snowpack and stream flow
due to warming while improving the resilience of forest stands. As
an incidental benefit in an era of dwindling water supplies and
projected water shortages, forest thinning could play a role in
augmenting river flows on a seasonal basis, improving conditions
for water-dependent ecosystems, and benefitting the water supplies
of downstream communities. Accelerated forest thinning to reduce
water stress and wildfire risk is one of the only management
options under our control, and it is probably the most critical to
apply over the short term. Because the effects are temporary, it is
important to frame accelerated thinning as a reset of ecosystem
resilience, not a permanent cure. Rather, accelerated forest
thinning creates opportunities to apply other management tools
that restore forest resilience at broader scales, whereas manage-
ment actions at the current pace will likely not be sufficient to
address recent and projected changes in forest conditions.
