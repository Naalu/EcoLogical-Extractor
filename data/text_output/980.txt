Abstract
Logging contractors supply raw material (i.e., sawlogs and wood chips) to the forest products manufacturing sector and are
an integral component of the Inland Northwest’s forest products industry. However, a lack of information exists describing
the structure and systems of the contract logging sector. A mail survey was administered in 2005 to assess the contract logging
sector in Idaho, Montana, and Eastern Washington, focusing on employment characteristics, capital investments, operational
characteristics, and business constraints. Of the 1,202 surveys that were mailed, 349 useable surveys were returned for an
effective response rate of 35 percent. The total harvest volume for the Inland Northwest reported by respondents for 2004 was
1,586,147 MBF (MBF). Respondents indicated that the constraint that most adversely affected their business in 2004 was timber
sale availability followed by quality employees. The mean age for respondents was 51, while 58 percent of their employees were
found to be 40 years or greater in age. Contract logging firms producing more than 10 MMBF in 2004 accounted for just
10 percent of the total firms, but represented 53 percent of the total 2004 harvest volume among responding firms. A positive
correlation was found between the contractor’s months of scheduled work and their level of innovativeness. On the topic of
fuel-reduction harvesting contracts on Federal lands, there was a high level of skepticism and uncertainty among respondents.
During the 1990s and into the 2000s, the forest products
industry of the Inland Northwest experienced a dramatic
decline in available timber from National Forest lands.
According to Keegan et al. (2001), harvests from Federal
timberland in the western United States declined more than
80 percent from 1989 to 1999. Idaho and Montana saw simi-
lar declines of 89 and 70 percent, respectively, during the
same period (Keegan et al. 2001, O’Laughlin 2004). In addi-
tion to the declines, mill closures and increased operating
costs have had a great impact on contract logging firms in this
region.
Despite National Forest harvest declines in the 1990s, the
forest products industry remains a major component of the
Inland Northwest’s economic base. For instance, Idaho ranks
second among all states in its dependence on the forest prod-
ucts industry; more than 4.5 percent of Idaho’s gross labor
income is derived from the wood and paper products manu-
facturing sectors (O’Laughlin 2004). Similarly, in Western
Montana, where the manufacturing of forest products is most
concentrated, the industry provides roughly 35 percent of the
basic labor income (Keegan et al. 2001).
Contract logging firms are an important subset of the indus-
try. These are firms primarily engaged in timber harvesting on
a fee or contract basis, using their own crew and equipment on
forests owned or leased by others (Sunderman 1998). Con-
tract logging firms include sole proprietorships, partnerships,
and corporations that vary in size (i.e., capital investments
and/or number of employees) and in the type of harvesting
systems that are used in forest operations. The forest products
manufacturing sector of the Inland Northwest depends almost
exclusively upon independent contract logging firms to sup-
ply such raw material as sawlogs, pulpwood, ton wood, and
poles. Despite their importance to the forest products industry

and the regional economy, little is known about the character-
istics of these independent contract logging businesses. With-
out historical and current structural information such as de-
mographics, productivity, and systems in use, it is difficult to
assess how current constraints have affected these businesses.
Professional reports are published on an annual basis that
assess the forest products industry in this region, but are lim-
ited to the primary processing of logs into lumber and the
value-added processes that follow (Blatner et al. 2004,
Keegan et al. 2005, 2006). Hence, there is a lack of detailed
information describing the initial operations of harvesting
raw material from the forest. Policy makers may use the cur-
rent status of these businesses to evaluate how this sector may
be affected by new regulations or policy changes. Thus, there
is a need for a better understanding of the business capacity,
structure, and the current profile of harvesting operations of
the Inland Northwest. Additionally, the results provide valu-
able information to educators in the field and help with the
development of outreach projects. Moreover, the information
also allows specialists to track the changes of the industry that
acts as a major component to the Inland Northwest’s eco-
nomic base.
The overall goal of this study was to understand the char-
acteristics and current condition of the independent contract
logging sector within the Inland Northwest. The specific ob-
jectives were to: (1) identify the types of systems used,
(2) define employee and production attributes: crew size,
number of crews, productivity, and employment characteris-
tics, (3) obtain owner characteristics: mean age, educa-
tion, capital investment of operations, and years in business,
(4) assess the current business characteristics and constraints,
and (5) understand contractors’ perception of fuel-reduction
harvests and their associated contracts.
Methodology
The target population for the study represented contract
logging firms in the Inland Northwest: namely, Montana,
Idaho, and Eastern Washington (east of the Cascade Mountain
Range). Generally, contract logging firms located in the In-
land Northwest use similar harvesting systems and methods to
produce sawlogs, as well as wood chips for the pulp and paper
sector (Johnson 2005). Contractors often cross state political
boundaries for harvesting activities and to market their prod-
ucts (Johnson 2005). Therefore, our survey aggregated these
three states rather than focus independently on each state. The
harvesting operations on the west side of the State of Wash-
ington and including the Cascade Mountain Range are much
larger in scale and vary substantially from the operations lo-
cated within the Inland Northwest and were not assessed in
this study.
The sampling frame for Idaho was in the form of a master
list generated by combining mailing lists from Idaho’s Log-
ging Safety Bureau, the Idaho’s Associated Logging Contrac-
tors, and the University of Idaho’s Cooperative Extension out-
reach program. This process resulted in identifying 695 con-
tract logging firms. In Montana and Eastern Washington,
these lists were not available; therefore, mailing lists were
purchased from an online industry database (Dun & Brad-
street). The list for Montana included 298 contract logging
businesses, while Eastern Washington’s list yielded 209. The
three mailing lists were designed to generate the names of all
bona fide contract logging firms in each state. Contractor and
business names were then cross-checked to ensure that firms
were not repeated in the master list. The total sample frame
for this study included 1,202 firms. Similar to Greene
et al. (2001), Luppold et al. (1998), and Munn et al. (1998), a
survey instrument was mailed to every contract logging firm
on the list.
An inductive and qualitative research approach was needed
to become familiar with the constraints that contractors are
faced with as business owners. The method used for this study
involved personal and telephone interviews with contractors
that perform logging operations in Idaho, Montana, and East-
ern Washington to determine the environmental, business,
and regulatory constraints that appear to hinder them as small
business owners. From these discussions it was possible to
formulate questions that could be used in a quantitative ap-
proach to assess business constraints.
A mail survey was used to collect data for this study. Al-
though telephone surveys can be effective, it was determined
that it would be inefficient to contact contract logging firms at
their residences since they often work away from home for
extended periods of time. Moreover, participants are able to
exercise greater care and take more time in completing mail
surveys relative to telephone surveys (Brown 1937, Malhotra
1993, Mangione 1995). The survey instrument was pretested
in January during the 2005 Idaho Associated Logging Con-
tractors annual board meeting in Boise, Idaho. Contractors
were asked to complete the survey and to make suggestions
and comments on the format, terminology, and question flow
so as to improve the readability and comprehension of the
questions used in the instrument. After reviewing contractors’
critiques captured by the pretest, questions were revised and a
final survey questionnaire was prepared.
The mail survey was designed and administered using a
modified Tailored Design Method for mail surveys (Dillman
2000). To increase the response rate, surveys were mailed
during the spring breakup season, a period of time between
March and May when most harvesting operations are idle due
to adverse on-ground harvesting conditions (i.e., high soil MC
in the harvest site) and limitations and restrictions on road use.
A survey booklet and cover letter were mailed to 1,202 log-
ging contractors in mid-March of 2005. The cover letter ex-
plained the importance and objectives of the study, ensured
confidentiality, included contact information, and provided
brief instructions for completing the survey. In addition, the
cover letter pointed out that the survey should be returned us-
ing an enclosed postage-paid return envelope, and that an in-
centive existed for those who returned a completed survey.
For completing the survey, each respondent was entered into a
drawing for a new STIHL® chain saw. One week after the
initial mailing, a postcard was sent out thanking those who
had responded and courteously reminding nonrespondents to
complete their survey. Two additional mailings that included
a survey booklet and cover letter requesting participation
from nonrespondents were delivered at 4 and 9 weeks follow-
ing the initial mailing.
Evidence of nonresponse bias can greatly impact the valid-
ity of a survey research study. According to Fowler (1984),
survey participants who respond to follow-up appeals are of-
ten assumed to behave more like nonrespondents than initial
respondents. To assess whether nonresponse bias existed in
the results of this study, a modified Armstrong and Overton
(1977) test method was utilized in this study. Using a paired
28

sample t–test at an alpha level of 0.05, the first 25 percent of
firms that responded to the mail survey were compared to the
last 25 percent of firms responding to the mail survey using
five randomly selected questions within the survey instru-
ment. To avoid confounding variables, results from questions
that could be influenced by firm size were not used in the
nonresponse and regional bias analysis. None of the compari-
sons identified a statistically significant difference between
early and late respondents, suggesting that late respondents
behave like that of early respondents.
The impact of regional bias was another factor that needed
to be assessed in this study given that the number of respon-
dents varied between the three states surveyed. Using one-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Scheffe’s posthoc
multiple comparison of means test at an alpha level of 0.05,
the same five questions used previously were again analyzed
to determine whether respondents from contract logging firms
from one state responded differently from their peers located
in the other two states. Again, none of these comparisons re-
sulted in statistically significant differences (p-value > 0.05),
suggesting that contract logging firms operating within the
Inland Northwest, regardless of state, responded similarly to
the survey.
Results and discussion
Response rate
Of the 1,202 surveys mailed to contract logging firms, 35
were undeliverable and 182 respondents indicated that they
did not manage or own a contract logging business in 2004
(e.g., retired, out of business, another occupation); reducing
the effective sample frame to 985. A total of 349 complete and
usable surveys were received, representing an effective re-
sponse rate of 35.4 percent. The response rate compared fa-
vorably to other studies examining contract logging firms
(Greene et al. 1988, Luppold et al. 1998, Greene et al. 2001,
Powers 2004, Montgomery et al. 2005, Milauskas and Wang
2006). By state, Montana contractors represented the highest
effective response rate of 42.2 percent, followed by Idaho
with 33.3 percent, and Eastern Washington with 32.0 percent.
Idaho contractors possessed the highest gross number of re-
turned and usable surveys, followed by Montana and Eastern
Washington.
Operational characteristics
The general characteristics found among contract logging
firms based on the percentage of harvest volume for 2004 are
summarized in Table 1. The total harvest volume for the In-
land Northwest reported by respondents for 2004 was
1,586,147 thousand board feet (MBF). According to Keegan
et al. (2006), the 2004 annual harvest volume for Idaho and
Montana was 1,236,985 MBF and 702,394 MBF, respec-
tively. Therefore, the contract logging firms surveyed in this
study were representative of 87 percent of the Idaho harvest
volume and 55 percent of the Montana harvest volume in
2004. Actual 2004 harvest volume for Eastern Washington
was not available for comparative assessment.
Nearly 75 percent of responding firms’ harvest volume
originated from private and industrial lands, while 21.6 per-
cent of the harvest volume was derived from publicly man-
aged lands (Fig. 1). On a volume basis, less than 11 percent of
the 2004 harvest was reported to be clearcuts, while other re-
generation harvests represented 51 percent of the harvest vol-
ume (Table 1).
Ground-based harvesting systems accounted for 72.6 per-
cent of the harvest volume, followed by cable logging opera-
tions with 23.5 percent, and helicopter yarding at 3.9 percent.
Nearly three-quarters of the product was transported to land-
ing areas by whole tree operations with the remainder in
log length. When assessing the level of machine use in har-
vesting operations, over two-thirds of the 2004 annual harvest
volume was implemented by mechanized limbing and buck-
ing technology (Table 1). This result is consistent with the
harvesting systems used in the region: cable and helicopter
logging operations that represent 27.4 percent in the region
mainly use a chain saw for felling and processing trees at the
stump.
Respondents averaged 51 years of age and had been in the
contract logging sector for an average of 23 years. Of the per-
sonnel employed by contract logging contractors, 58 percent
were found to be 40 years or greater in age. The sawmill in-
dustry in the Inland Northwest is concerned that there is an
aging workforce among contracting firms that may someday

limit their supply of raw material. However, this concern is
not limited to the forest products industry. Carroll and Taeu-
ber (2004) reported that from 1992 to 2002, an increasing per-
centage of Idaho’s workforce was 45 years and older. They
also report that the proportion of individuals 65 years and
older who continue working has increased slightly. Trends
regarding an aging contract logging sector workforce may not
be answered by the results of this study; yet, the age charac-
teristics provide a baseline for future studies where trends can
be identified. Nearly 90 percent of the responding contractors
were found to be high school graduates. In addition, 44 per-
cent of respondents had also received some level of higher
education such as technical training and college course work
or a college degree.
The contract logging firms within the region surveyed vary
in their operating systems (i.e., ground-based, cable, helicop-
ter) and in size (i.e., annual harvest volume). In fact, surveyed
firms ranged from 10 to 81,538 MBF for their total 2004 har-
vest volume. Business characteristics and constraints often
vary according to firm size. Luppold et al. (1998) found that
barriers to increasing production, such as workers’ compen-
sation, taxes, and regulations, impacted businesses differently
depending on firm size. Recognizing this, firms were classi-
fied by their annual production to assess characteristics and
constraints based on firm size: small (0 to 1.00 MMBF), me-
dium (1.01 to 5.00 MMBF), large (5.01 to 10.00 MMBF), and
very large (10.01 MMBF).
Survey results indicate that the contract logging sector
within the Inland Northwest is dominated by small and me-
dium sized harvesting firms, representing 74 percent of the
responding firms in this study. Despite the large number of
small and medium sized firms located in the Inland North-
west, they produce only 23.7 percent of the annual harvest on
a volume basis (Table 2). Although very large firms only ac-
counted for 10.1 percent of the total firms surveyed, they pro-
duced 53.0 percent of the annual harvest volume. This firm
size-harvest volume relationship has been observed in other
past studies (Powers 2004, Rickenbach et al. 2005). Table 3
summarizes the production characteristics by firm size clas-
sification for 2004. Aggregate results derived from median
values show that contract logging firms employed a total of
four workers, had one three-worker crew, and had a monthly
production rate of 539 MBF in 2004.
As one might expect, capital investment in contract logging
operations varied by firm size. The categorical median values
for small and medium firms were identical at $100,000 to
$500,000, $1 to $1.5 million for large firms, and greater than
$1.5 million for very large firms. Small firms reported having
two to 4 months of prospective scheduled work, while
medium, large, and very large firms reported having four to
16 months of prospective scheduled work (based on median
logarithmic response categories).
Business constraints
Contract logging business performance is believed to be
highly influenced by several external factors. Respondents
were asked to rate a number of potential constraints that ad-
versely affected their business in 2004 utilizing a Likert-like
scale ranging from 1 to 6 (1 = not applicable, 2 = no limitation,
3 = some limitation, 4 = moderate limitation, 5 = strong limi-
tation, 6 = critical limitation). The values presented in Table 4
represent the mean values and rankings for each constraint
evaluated based on firm size. Results indicated that timber
sale availability was perceived by respondents to be the high-
est rated business constraint. It is speculated that this rating is
partially attributable to the overall decline in the annual har-
vest (i.e., lack of stumpage supply) since the late 1980s and
early 1990s in the region, especially on publicly owned lands.

The second highest rated business constraint as reported by
survey respondents was finding and keeping quality employ-
ees. Incidentally, this concern was expressed on several occa-
sions while interviewing contractors during the development
of the survey instrument. The major issue stated by contrac-
tors during these interviews was finding younger employees
that were interested in pursuing the profession. If the forest
products workforce is indeed aging, this issue maybe a con-
tributing factor.
Stumpage cost and worker’s compensation shared the same
mean business constraint value, representing the third/fourth
ranked constraints. Equipment availability and credit avail-
ability ranked sixth and seventh, respectively, as perceived
business constraints; however, the results in Table 4 suggests
that small and medium-sized businesses may have more dif-
ficulty attaining credit compared to larger firms.
Business characteristics
Survey participants were asked to indicate, via a categorical
response item, their current total months of scheduled future
contract logging work. This question was followed by two
Likert-like scale questions. The first of these two questions
asked respondents to self-rate their level of innovativeness on
a scale from 1 to 5 (1 defined by never investing in the newest
technology available and 5 defined by always investing in the
newest technology available). The second question was used
to self-rate their level of financial risk aversion on scale from
1 to 5 (1 indicating that they never assume risk and 5 indicat-
ing that they readily assume risk). Using Multivariate Analy-
sis of Variance (MANOVA) and Scheffe’s posthoc multiple
comparison of means test at an alpha level of 0.05, a statisti-
cally significant relationship was found whereby an increased
respondent self-perception of innovativeness was positively
correlated to the level of scheduled work. A statistically sig-
nificant Pearson’s bivariate correlation (0.199) indicated that
contract logging firms were more likely to invest in newer
technology as their level of scheduled work increased. Al-
though no statistically significant relationship was found be-
tween a firm’s level of scheduled work and risk aversion, con-
tract logging firms with increasing levels of self-perceived
innovativeness were found to be more willing to accept finan-
cial risk (Pearson’s bivariate correlation of 0.465).
Contract logging firms were prompted to give a break-
down of their 2004 harvest volume by percentage given the
following sale size categories: less than 100 MBF, 100 MBF
to 1 MMBF, 1 MMBF plus to 2 MMBF, and more than
2 MMBF. A follow-up question embedded later in the survey
asked respondents to select the sale size that was most effi-
cient given their current harvesting system based on the same
categorical volumes. This question was to understand the har-
vest volume of a timber sale that their current harvesting
systems could handle at an optimal level of their operational
efficiency (i.e., running not under or over the operational ca-
pacity of their harvesting systems). A Chi-square analysis (al-
pha level of 0.5) indicated firms that checked the “< 100 mbf ”
and “100 mbf to 1 mmbf ” categories for most efficient sale
sizes were predominantly harvesting tracts well suited for
their operations. However, firms that claimed to be most effi-
cient on sales from “1 mmbf plus to 2 mmbf” were only mar-
ginally significant ( p-value = 0.084), suggesting they were
harvesting some tracts that were inefficient for their opera-
tional capacity. Firms most efficient on sales “> 2 mmbf ”
showed no statistical significance ( p-value = 0.854), indicat-
ing that they often harvest tracts that are too small for their
operations, thus running capacity-inefficient operations.
Fuel-reduction harvesting sales
The Forest Restoration Act was introduced in 2003 to re-
duce the risk of catastrophic wildfires and to streamline the
complexities of environmental analyses on Federally man-
aged lands for forest fuel-reduction sales (The White House
2003). As part of this study, contract logging firms were asked
a series of questions focusing on Federal fuel-reduction sales
that could potentially provide many new timber sale opportu-
nities for bid (i.e., increase supply). Although contract loggers
rated timber sale availability as their highest perceived busi-
ness constraint that adversely affected their business in 2004,
only 62 percent of contractors reported that they were consid-
ering participating in these Federal fuel-reduction sales. Of
the contract logging firms that responded to this question,
two-thirds indicated that the minimum sale volume that they
would bid on would be between 100 MBF and 1 MMBF,
while the remaining respondents indicated that they would bid
on harvest sales with lesser volume.

Contract logging firms were provided a list of six issues
related to contracts involving fuel-reduction harvesting op-
erations on Federal forestland and were asked to check a box
next to any of these issues that they perceived existed in these
contracts. The highlighted results indicated that two-thirds of
the respondents believed that these Federal harvest sales
would not be profitable to their firm, while 11.7 percent of
respondents believed the sales would be profitable. In addi-
tion, 62.5 percent of responding contract logging firms be-
lieved that there would be additional services mandated (i.e.,
slash removal) in these Federal timber sales that would in-
crease overall variable costs of operation (Fig. 2).
Fifty-three contractors responded to an open-ended quali-
tative question asking for “other issues and concerns that you
perceive exist in contracts involving fuel-reduction harvest-
ing operations on federal lands” (Table 5). USDA Forest Ser-
vice politics was the most frequent concern reported by con-
tract logging respondents, followed by difficulties in fulfilling
contract requirements, marketability of product, and whether
there would be enough volume allocated by the USDA Forest
Service to convert to a small-log harvesting operation. Other
issues mentioned by responding contractors included lawsuits
ceasing operations (9%) and profitability uncertainty of fuel-
reduction sales (9%).
Conclusion
This study profiled the current status and conditions of the
contract logging sector within the Inland Northwest by assess-
ing operational characteristics, demographics, business con-
straints, and contractors’ perceptions of fuel-reduction har-
vesting sales based on respondents 2004 harvest information.
The study’s 349 responding contractors harvested more than
1,586 MMBF in 2004: 1,075 MMBF in Idaho, 0.388 MMBF
in Montana, and 0.123 MMBF in Eastern Washington. Nearly
75 percent of this volume was derived from private and in-
dustrial lands, while 21.6 percent of the harvest volume orig-
inated from publicly managed lands. Contractors averaged
51 years of age and had been in the harvesting business for an
average of 23 years. Of the personnel employed by logging
firms, 58 percent were found to be 40 years or greater in age.
It is suggested that future research place greater emphasis on
assessing the aging workforce and the associated policy im-
plications within the contract logging sector.
Responding firms ranked timber sale availability (i.e.,
stumpage supply) as their highest perceived business con-
straint for the 2004 harvest year. However, only 62 percent of
the contract logging firms surveyed were considering partici-
pating in Federal fuel-reduction harvest sales. One would tend
to believe that this percentage would be much higher since
these sales could potentially open up harvestable stumpage
volumes on Federal lands that have recently been on the de-
cline. A closer examination at the results, however, indicates
that contractors remain very skeptical of Federal fuel-
reduction contracts and the associated sales. Two-thirds of
respondents believed that these sales would not be profitable
to their firm, while 62.5 percent believed that there would
be additional services mandated (i.e., slash removal) that
would consequently increase overall variable costs. Other
concerns stated by contractors regarding fuel-reduction sale
contracts included the bureaucratic nature of the USDA For-
est Service, difficulties fulfilling contract requirements, and
the marketability of the product to be harvested from fuel-
reduction sites.
The results of this study suggest that small and medium-
sized firms predominantly harvest tracts well suited for their
operations, while large firms harvest some tracts that are in-
efficient given their operational capacities (i.e., tracts are too
small relative to operational capacity). The information pro-
vided by contract logging firms during interviews suggest that
because of increased competition on sales, firms are bidding
on sales that they would not normally harvest, but have done
so in order to generate appropriate cash flow to service debt
and remain in business.
Future survey research similar to this study is recommended
to track the changing characteristics (i.e., demographics, op-
erational characteristics, and business constraints) of the
contract logging sector of the Inland Northwest. A separate
in-depth study focusing solely on USDA Forest Service fuel-
reduction harvesting contracts and sales would provide Fed-
eral land managers information needed to increase the number
of contractors bidding on these sales.
