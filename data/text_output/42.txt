Old-growth trees still threatened on Kaibab 
03/26/2005 
 
To the editor:  
Those pesky environmentalists may be in a time warp, but your editorial writer seems to 
be in a logic warp. The first argument seems to be: Anything that the Ecological 
Restoration Institute does is good. Many ERI graduates go to work for the Forest Service. 
The North Kaibab is part of the Forest Service. Ergo, anything that the North Kaibab 
plans to do is good. The editorial also points out that old-growth trees are typically 18 
inches and larger.  
How then, you ask, could old growth be threatened with a cutting cap of 24 inches? I 
think the answer would be, by the writer's own definition, those trees that are between 18 
and 24 inches are threatened. I'm just guessing here, but if 92 percent of the trees are less 
than 12 inches, and 8 percent are between 12 and 24 inches, then the number of trees 
between 18 and 24 inches is probably really small. When there aren't very many to begin 
with, each one cut has a bigger impact, percentage wise. Of course, the reassurance that 
big trees will only be cut if they are competing for water makes me curious to see the 
trees in Arizona that aren't competing for water.
