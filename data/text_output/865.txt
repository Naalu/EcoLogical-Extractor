Introduction 
 
Vegetation studies have been conducted in the American Southwest for well over a century.  
Studies such as C. Hart Merriam’s classic survey of life zones on the San Francisco Peaks 
(Merriam & Stejneger 1890) were conducted over short time periods, while others have 
continued for decades and rival the length of studies in other regions of North America.  For 
example, Sonoran desert plots established by V. M. Spalding in 1906 have been the subject 
of ongoing research (Shreve 1929; Shreve & Hinckley 1937; Goldberg & Turner 1986). 
 
Long-term studies vary in familiarity.  Some are well documented because they are part of 
the Long Term Ecological Research network (e.g., Jornada Experimental Range; http://usda-
ars.nmsu.edu/), associated with a University (e.g., Santa Rita Experimental Range; 
http://ag.arizona.edu/SRER), or part of the Biosphere Reserve Program (e.g., Beaver Creek 
Experimental Watershed; http://ag.arizona.edu/OALS/watershed/beaver/).  However, other 
studies are equally rich in data depth, but have been long forgotten or ignored by many 
researchers and managers.  In this paper, we describe several long-term studies in the 
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of the American Southwest, focusing on the unique 
insights and contributions of these studies. 
 
Many of the studies that we discuss were established by staff from the Fort Valley 
Experiment Station (FVES; http://www.rmrs.nau.edu/fortvalley/).  Located in Flagstaff, 
Arizona, FVES was the first US Forest Service (USFS) research facility in the nation.  FVES 
was established in August 1908 after the Riordan brothers, owners of the Arizona Lumber 
and Timber Company, asked Gifford Pinchot to study why ponderosa pine forests were not 
regenerating after logging (Olberding 2000).  Abundant regeneration occurred within a few 
decades because a wet year and good seed crop coincided with several years of fire 
suppression and livestock grazing (Meagher 1950); today, the forests are greatly overstocked 
and at risk from severe crown fires, insect attacks, and other disturbances. 
 
FVES and its research forest, the Fort Valley Experimental Forest (FVEF), were primary 
sites for forest management studies in District 3 (now USFS Region 3) through the 1940s.  
Many young foresters worked and trained at FVES, including Yale alumni such as C. F. 
Korstian, W. R. Mattoon, T. S. Woolsey, Jr., R. H. Westveld, F. Hassis, and E. Fritz (Fritz 
1964).  While FVES is no longer active, it is listed on the National Register of Historical

Places and efforts are underway to restore the buildings (Olberding 2000).  Research begun 
by the FVES continues to be conducted by the US Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research 
Station (RMRS), Northern Arizona University, and other agencies.  Data collected by the 
FVES is housed in the Fort Valley Archives, RMRS. 
 
 
Growth and Yield Studies 
 
Trees have been a primary focus of vegetation studies in the ponderosa pine forests of the 
Southwest.  Many of the early studies were established by foresters, often with an eye on tree 
growth and timber yield. 
 
The Woolsey Plots 
 
As early as 1906, there was a recognized need for studies of western yellow pine (now 
ponderosa pine) and its management (Pearson 1910; Woolsey 1911, 1912).  In 1909, a set of 
instructions were drafted by T. S. Woolsey, Jr. (Assistant District Forester and Chief of the 
Office of Silviculture, District 3, USFS) and G. A. Pearson (Director, FVES) that led to the 
establishment of a network of permanent plots in the ponderosa pine forests of the 
Southwest.  Between 1909 and 1915, approximately 50 permanent sample plots ranging up to 
6 ha in size were established (Woolsey 1911; Pearson 1923, 1933, 1950).  Trees were 
measured on a five-year cycle to evaluate stand growth and commercial potential.  Pearson 
died in 1949, and remeasurements ceased soon afterwards as he had no clear successor and 
research priorities had shifted. 
 
In 1997, the RMRS funded personnel at the School of Forestry and Ecological Restoration 
Institute at Northern Arizona University (NAU) to begin relocating and remeasuring the plots 
(Malakoff 2002).  While many plots were relocated, others had been destroyed by road 
construction, crown fires, and urban development.  Remeasurements were conducted using 
the original methods but with different objectives.  Rather than focusing on timber 
production, the historical and contemporary data have been used to quantify historical stand 
conditions (Moore et al. 2004a), assess our ability to reconstruct those conditions (Huffman 
et al. 1999, 2001; Sánchez Meador et al. 2003, 2004; Bakker, in press), and analyze changes 
in spatial pattern and ecosystem structure and function (Moore et al. 2004b).  In addition, 
recent work (Bell 2005) suggests that ongoing management activities can change the 
trajectory of stand structural development. 
 
A set of smaller (4.5 m2) subplots were established on some plots in 1914 to assess 
ponderosa pine regeneration.  The herbaceous vegetation on each subplot was mapped along 
with the locations of pine seedlings relative to grass clumps, rocks, and other features.  By 
remapping the subplots, we have examined long-term (85-year) changes in plant diversity 
and cover (Bakker et al. 2002). 
 
Taylor Woods

Taylor Woods was a sheep pasture in the early 1900s until stocked by the abundant pine 
regeneration of the early 1900s.  As part of FVEF, Taylor Woods received silvicultural 
treatments in 1925 and 1942.  In 1962, the even-aged regeneration in Taylor Woods was 
thinned at different stocking levels to examine tree and stand growth patterns; similar studies 
were established on the Pringle Falls Experimental Forest, Black Hills Experimental Forest, 
and other sites in the western United States (Schubert 1971; Ronco et al. 1985). 
 
The experiment was originally planned to run for 20 years, with measurements every 5 years 
and subsequent thinning treatments every 10 years.  Tentative conclusions were drawn after 5 
years (Schubert 1971), some of which were confirmed after 20 years while others were 
contradicted (Ronco et al. 1985).  Taylor Woods was one of the first experiments to 
demonstrate that ponderosa pine trees within dense dog-hair thickets would release following 
thinning. 
 
The Taylor Woods experiment has continued to be supported by the RMRS (notably by C. B. 
Edminster) and has run for more than 40 years, with the most recent measurements and 
treatments in 2002 (J. D. Bailey, pers. comm.).  While scientists no longer focus primarily on 
timber production as they did when Taylor Woods was established, they have increasingly 
recognized the unique long-term nature of Taylor Woods and the potential to use this 
experiment to address a variety of other research questions.  Examples of these studies 
include assessments of overstory thinning effects on tree regeneration (Bailey & Covington 
2002), foliage and soil nutrients (Wollum & Schubert 1975) tree physiology (T. E. Kolb, 
pers. comm.), tree resistance to attack by insects (Kolb et al. 1998), and microbial 
communities (Overby et al. 2005). 
 
 
Range Studies - the Hill Plots 
 
While foresters focused on the overstory, range scientists focused on the herbaceous 
understory vegetation (Olberding et al. 2005).  R. R. Hill, a USFS Grazing Examiner, began 
to study the effects of intense livestock grazing on tree regeneration in 1910 (Hill 1917).  In 
1912, he established a secondary study of how the understory vegetation recovers when 
protected from livestock grazing.  At each of five sites on the Coconino National Forest, an 
exclosure (~0.7 ha) was built to exclude livestock (Figure 1).  Quadrats were established 
inside and outside the exclosures, and the vegetation mapped periodically between 1912 and 
1941.  New vegetation sampling methods such as the line intercept method (Canfield 1941) 
were developed on these and other sites, including the Santa Rita Experimental Range, in 
part because of recognized inadequacies of existing methods for sampling these long-term 
sites.  Early reports (e.g., Talbot & Hill 1923; Merrick 1939; Arnold 1950) concluded that the 
herbaceous understory vegetation requires several decades to recover from severe livestock 
grazing. 
 
The last historical data that we are aware of from these plots was collected in 1947.  Data 
collection resumed in 2002, but in the interim, part of one site was subject to a prescribed 
burn, several sites received silvicultural treatments, power and phone lines bisected two sites 
and a Forest Service road another, and one site was nearly destroyed by the construction of 

9/16/2005

an interstate highway.  The Coconino National Forest was not alerted to the fact that the 
proposed highway ran through the plot until the final road surveys were almost complete.  In 
a memo dated June 7, 1957, E. M. Gaines noted that the Supervisor of the forest would insist 
that the state of Arizona relocate the highway “if we feel that the plot has sufficient historic 
and current value”.  Thankfully, they did recognize its value, and the relocated highway runs 
near instead of through the plot. 
 
Thanks to the advent of increasingly powerful computers, historical data have been 
reanalyzed using techniques undreamt of when the data were collected.  For example, 
statistical significance has been assessed by permuting the data thousands of times, and 
mapped quadrats have been digitized and entered into a geographic information system (GIS) 
database.  The GIS database permits the easy quantification of areas and spatial patterns.  
Previously, the area occupied by each plant was measured by overlaying a fine grid on the 
map and painstakingly counting the number of cells occupied by it; these measurements were 
then confirmed by having another person make the same measurements. 
 
Recent analyses (Bakker 2005) have shown that continued livestock grazing reduced the 
establishment of pine trees and found some differences between grazing treatments.  After 
accounting for shading and other overstory effects, however, observed differences in species 
richness and cover between grazing treatments were no longer evident.  Computer-intensive 
techniques were used to analyze historical and contemporary species data and identify 
species that were more abundant and frequent in particular grazing treatments and years, and 
in the open or under the tree canopy.  In addition, cryptogamic crusts have been sampled 
within the exclosures, as few other sites in the region have been undisturbed for as long as 
these (M. A. Bowker, unpub. data). 
 
 
Ecological Restoration Experiments 
 
Frequent surface fires were a natural disturbance in southwestern ponderosa pine forests prior 
to settlement of the area by Euro-Americans (Dieterich 1980).  The subsequent suppression 
of these fires caused tree densities to increase dramatically and greatly increased the risk of 
crown fires (Cooper 1960; Covington & Moore 1994). 
 
Interval Burning Studies - Chimney Springs and Limestone Flats 
 
In 1976, studies were implemented to identify a burning interval that would reduce the risk of 
crown fire.  Replicate studies were established on basalt soils at Chimney Springs (located in 
the FVEF) and sandstone soils at Limestone Flats (located in the Long Valley Experimental 
Forest; http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/main/expfor/longvalley.html).  Seven treatments were 
established at each site, including unburned plots and plots burned at intervals ranging from 1 
to 10 years (Sackett 1980).  The expectation was that fires would consume surface fuels and 
thin the dense stands of small trees, enabling the older and larger trees to survive and grow. 
 
Given that one of the treatments involved burning every 10 years, a long-term approach was 
obviously required.  Repeated burning did not kill as many postsettlement trees as was hoped 

9/16/2005 
5 
but, unexpectedly, a number of the large trees began to die several years later.  Further 
research demonstrated that surface fuel accumulations were so great under these trees that 
fires were more intense and damaged the roots and cambium (Sackett et al. 1996). 
 
Since their establishment, the interval burning studies have been the subject of numerous 
other studies, including analyses of tree regeneration rates (Bailey & Covington 2002), soil 
chemistry (Neary et al. 2003; S. C. Hart, pers. comm.), root and mycorrhizae dynamics (Hart 
et al. 2005), and whether fire interval affects the frequency with which a dominant grass is 
infected by endophytic fungi (Faeth et al. 2002).  A long time frame is necessary for these 
studies as the effects of repeated fires may accumulate and gradually become more 
important. 
 
Gus Pearson Natural Area Restoration Experiment 
 
The Forest Service manages a network of Research Natural Areas that are permanently 
protected and maintained in natural conditions (a list of RNAs in the western U.S. is 
available at http://rna.nris.state.mt.us/rna_about.html).  One of these, the Gus Pearson 
Natural Area (GPNA), is an old-growth ponderosa pine forest within the FVEF.  GPNA has 
been measured since 1925 and is the subject of numerous publications (e.g., Avery et al. 
1976; Dieterich & Swetnam 1984; White 1985; Biondi 1994, 1996, 1999; Biondi et al. 1994; 
Fulé et al. 2001).  A portion of GPNA was decommissioned (withdrawn from RNA status) in 
1992 to serve as a fuelbreak for the FVES (Edminster & Olsen 1996).  The preparation of the 
fuelbreak was incorporated into an ecological restoration experiment involving untreated 
controls and thinning and composite (thinning, forest floor fuel reduction, and prescribed 
burning) treatments (Covington et al. 1997). 
 
The restoration experiment was developed in part because of the results from the interval 
burning studies.  Prescribed fire alone was insufficient to restore presettlement forest 
structure in these forests, suggesting that an initial thinning and the raking of the extensive 
litter layer away from the bases of large trees were required.  The development of this 
experiment provides an excellent example of adaptive management. 
 
Research at this experimental site has generated valuable insights about stand age structure 
(Savage et al. 1996; Mast et al. 1999) and the effects of restoration treatments.  Seven years 
after thinning, old ponderosa pine trees in the stand continued to respond positively in terms 
of leaf physiology and insect resistance (Wallin et al. 2004).  Herbaceous understory 
vegetation responds to restoration treatments (Moore et al., in revision), but responses differ 
between patches in the open and under the canopy and among functional groups and species 
(Laughlin et al., in revision).  Other studies have examined the effects of treatments and 
patch types on soil chemistry (Wright & Hart 1997; Kaye & Hart 1998a, b), nutrient fluxes 
(Kaye et al., in press), and soil microbes (Boyle et al. 2005). 
 
 
Ponderosa Pine Provenance Trials 
 

9/16/2005

In 1911, ponderosa pine seed was gathered at 26 locations throughout the western US, and 
seedlings were grown near Flagstaff, AZ.  The objective of this study was to identify seed 
sources (provenances) whose seedlings would survive and grow well in this environment.  
Seven provenances from the west coast and northern Rockies grew well in the nursery but 
were killed by the frosts and droughts common to this area before they could be outplanted.  
Eight provenances were eliminated within 5 years of planting, and another one after 50 years.  
The remaining 10 provenances were from the southern and eastern portions of ponderosa 
pine’s range in the United States (Larson 1966; Silen et al. 2003).  Taller provenances had 
higher yields (volume of live trees per acre) in the early years but survival became more 
important than tree height in determining yield in later years.  After 80 years, it was apparent 
that the locally collected provenance (Coconino) was also the best-yielding one.  In 
comparison, another Southwestern provenance, the Gila, had equal seedling heights as the 
Coconino but was 25% shorter and had one-twentieth as much volume after 80 years as the 
Coconino provenance (Silen et al. 2003). 
 
These findings are important when deciding how far away from its collection point seed can 
safely be used.  However, these trees can also be used in other studies by capitalizing on 
features such as the expression of genetic traits at different points in an organism’s life cycle.  
Since provenances differ genetically but have been grown in the same environment, this and 
other long-term trials have been used to examine genetic differences in physiology (T. E. 
Kolb, pers. comm.) and in resistance to insect attack (M. R. Wagner, pers. comm.).  Trees do 
not become susceptible to attack by insects such as sawflies and tip moths until they are 
about 15 years old and to attack by bark beetles until they are even older, demonstrating the 
value of long-term studies for addressing such questions. 
 
 
Summary 
 
There are many long-term studies in the Southwest beyond those described here.  One of the 
main challenges surrounding the use of long-term studies is simply learning about their 
existence.  Sites may be destroyed or abandoned as research priorities change.  Location 
maps and data may be lost or poorly documented, and raw data may be discarded or stored in 
formats that are inaccessible (e.g., on magnetic tapes or 8.5” floppy disks).  Support of long-
term ecological research should include funds and personnel to maintain research sites and to 
preserve data in accessible formats and locations.  The studies described here demonstrate 
that long-term experiments can yield valuable insights, and can be used to address questions 
that were not anticipated when the experiments were established.
