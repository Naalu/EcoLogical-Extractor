Conflicts of interest 
The review is led by researchers from Northern Arizona 
University and the USDA Forest Service who have 
contributed to the literature on this topic. We will address 
the possibility of conflict of interest by following the 
review process through CEBE and additional reviews 
solicited from scientists who are not on the review panel 
and not affiliated with the lead institutions.

Summary 
48 
 
49 
1. Background 
50 
 
51 
 
Broadcast seeding is one of the most widely used post-wildfire emergency 
52 
response treatments intended to reduce soil erosion, increase vegetative ground cover, 
53 
and minimize establishment and spread of non-native plant species.  However, 
54 
seeding treatments can also have negative effects such as competition with recovering 
55 
native plant communities and inadvertent introduction of invasive species.  Despite 
56 
ongoing debates over the efficacy of post-fire seeding and potential negative impacts 
57 
on natural plant community recovery, seeding remains a widely used stabilization 
58 
treatment in forested ecosystems throughout the western U.S.  Since publication of 
59 
Robichaud et al. (2000) and Beyers (2004), several developments have altered the 
60 
context of post-fire seeding.  These include increasing size and severity of wildfires 
61 
across the western U.S., increased research and quantitative monitoring on post-fire 
62 
seeding and plant community interactions, increased use and allocation of funds for 
63 
native seed mixes, and stronger policy direction for the use of locally-adapted and 
64 
genetically-appropriate seed sources (seed sources adapted to local site conditions and 
65 
genetically compatible with existing plant populations.  With the last review occurring 
66 
in 2004 there is a need to re-examine what is known about the effectiveness and 
67 
ecological impacts of post-fire seeding. 
68 
  
69 
2. Objectives 
70 
 
71 
Primary objective: Does seeding after severe forest fires mitigate negative impacts 
72 
on soils and plant communities? 
73 
 
74 
Secondary question(s): 1) What are seeding effects on soil stabilization and invasion 
75 
by non-native species?  2) What are trends in seeding of specific species, especially 
76 
the use of native species, over time?  3) What are the findings in regions beyond the 
77 
western USA? 
78 
 
79 
3. Methods 
80 
 
81 
 
To identify studies relevant to our review, we searched databases supported by 
82 
Northern Arizona University during July-November 2008, using a defined 
83 
combination of search terms.  We then eliminated papers, first based on title, then 
84 
abstract, then full text, based on a set of criteria that specified the review subjects 
85 
(seeding in western USA forests burned by severe wildfire), intervention (seeding 
86 
herbaceous plant of shrub seed alone or in combination with other post-fire 
87 
rehabilitation activities), and outcome (soil stabilization attributes and changes to 
88 
plant community attributes).  We assessed study quality based on study design and 
89 
statistical robustness, and applied a weight ((highest, high, medium, low, lowest) to 
90 
each study design category (replicated randomized experiment, observational 
91 
(multiple location case study), observational (single location case study), monitoring 
92 
report with quantitative data, monitoring report with qualitative data, BACI, review 
93 
paper, and expert opinion)) with the greatest weight given to replicated randomized 
94 
experiments and less to observational and opinion studies.  We evaluated post-fire 
95 
seeding effectiveness based on seeding treatment effectiveness in reducing erosion,

4 
non-native species invasions, and effects on native plant community recovery. When 
97 
available, quantitative data from seeded and unseeded treatments were compared.  
98 
Each study or individual study unit was given an effectiveness rating (effective, 
99 
minimal effectiveness, no difference in effectiveness, ineffective). We used 
100 
descriptive statistics and correlation/regression to explore relationships between post-
101 
fire seeding treatments and associated variables. 
102 
 
103 
4. Main Results 
104 
 
105 
 
Our review produced 94 relevant studies. Considering the entire dataset (n = 
106 
94), replicated and randomized experiments made up the largest study design 
107 
category. Using quality of evidence criteria, the number of studies of quantitative 
108 
experimental nature increased from the time period 2000-2009 compared to those 
109 
studies in 1970-1999.  Twenty-seven studies provided evidence regarding post-fire 
110 
seeding effects on soil erosion. As sampling designs have become more rigorous in 
111 
recent years, evidence that seeding is effective in reducing erosion has decreased.  A 
112 
main goal of post-wildfire stabilization treatments is to reduce soil erosion in the year 
113 
immediately following a fire; however, the majority of studies (78%) evaluating soil 
114 
erosion in seeded versus unseeded controls showed that seeding did not reduce 
115 
erosion relative to unseeded controls.  Even when seeding significantly increased 
116 
vegetative cover, seeded sites rarely supported sufficient plant cover to stabilize soils 
117 
within the first and second year post-fire. Of the papers evaluating seeding 
118 
effectiveness for curtailing invasions of non-native plant species, an almost equal 
119 
percentage found seeding treatments to be effective (54%) or ineffective (45%). 
120 
However, 83% of the treatments regarded as effective used non-native species, 
121 
potentially causing negative impacts on native communities.  A majority of studies 
122 
reported that seeding suppressed recovery of native plants (60%), although data on 
123 
long-term impacts of this reduction are limited.   
124 
 
125 
5. Conclusions 
126 
 
127 
 
This review suggests that post-fire seeding does little to protect soil in the 
128 
short-term, has equivocal effect on invasion of non-native species, and can have 
129 
negative effects on native vegetation recovery with possible long-term ecological 
130 
consequences.  Erosion may be better reduced by mulching, but care must be taken to 
131 
ensure that mulch is free of non-native seed.  Seeding has proven to be equivocal at 
132 
best for reducing non-native species spread after fire.  Early detection of new 
133 
undesirable species invasions through monitoring post-fire environments, in 
134 
combination with rapid response methods to quickly contain, deny reproduction, and 
135 
eliminate these invasions, may allow better control of non-native species 
136 
establishment than is typically obtained through seeding.  Plant community recovery 
137 
may be improved with the use of locally-adapted, genetically appropriate plant 
138 
materials, although more research regarding the effects and effectiveness of these 
139 
species is critical.

1. 
Background 
150 
 
151 
Land management agencies in the United States such as the USDA Forest 
152 
Service, National Park Service, and Bureau of Land Management are required by 
153 
federal burned area emergency rehabilitation policy to prescribe emergency 
154 
watershed-rehabilitation measures when and where deemed necessary to minimize 
155 
threats to life or property or to stabilize and prevent further unacceptable degradation 
156 
to natural and cultural resources resulting from the effects of a fire (USDA, 2004; 
157 
USDI, 2006).  Historically, aerial broadcast seeding of grasses, typically non-native 
158 
annuals or short-lived perennials, has been the most commonly used post-fire 
159 
stabilization treatment (Robichaud et al., 2000; Beyers, 2004).  Rapid vegetation 
160 
establishment has been regarded as the most cost-effective method to mitigate the 
161 
risks of increased runoff and soil erosion and establishment of non-native species over 
162 
large areas (Beyers, 2004).  Federal policy in the U.S. currently mandates use of seed 
163 
from native species for post-fire rehabilitation when available and economically 
164 
feasible (Richards et al., 1998).  Although the use of native species has increased 
165 
(Beyers, 2004; Wolfson and Sieg, in press), high costs and inadequate availability 
166 
often limit inclusion of native plants in post-fire seedings.  Furthermore, a vague 
167 
definition of the term “native” has led to inconsistent interpretations regarding the 
168 
types and origins of native species used (Richards et al., 1998).  Despite ongoing 
169 
debates over the efficacy of post-fire seeding and potential negative impacts on 
170 
natural plant community recovery, seeding remains a widely used stabilization 
171 
treatment in forested ecosystems throughout the western U.S.  (Robichaud et al., 
172 
2000, Beyers, 2004).  
173 
 
174 
 
Since publication of Robichaud et al. (2000) and Beyers (2004), several 
175 
developments have altered the context of post-fire seeding.  These include increasing 
176 
size and severity of wildfires across the western U.S. (McKenzie et al., 2004; 
177 
Westerling et al., 2006; Littell et al., 2009), increased research and quantitative 
178 
monitoring on post-fire seeding and plant community interactions, increased use and 
179 
allocation of funds for native seed mixes (Wolfson and Sieg, in press), and stronger 
180 
policy direction for the use of locally-adapted and genetically-appropriate seed 
181 
sources (seed sources adapted to local site conditions and genetically compatible with 
182 
existing plant populations (GAO, 2003; Rogers and Montalvo, 2004; USDA, 2006).  
183 
The time is ripe to re-examine what is known about the effectiveness and ecological 
184 
impacts of post-fire seeding. 
185 
 
186 
 
We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature, theses, and 
187 
burned area rehabilitation monitoring reports about post-fire seeding in forested 
188 
ecosystems across the western U.S.  We addressed three questions pertaining to post-
189 
fire seeding relative to overall treatment effectiveness and effects on soils and plant 
190 
communities: 1) Does seeding after severe forest fires reduce soil erosion? 2) Is 
191 
seeding effective at reducing non-native plant invasion into burned areas? and 3) Does 
192 
post-fire seeding affect native plant community recovery?

Question formulation 
213 
 
214 
The review team developed primary and secondary study questions, which were 
215 
further refined by managers, scientists, and outside experts in the field. We defined 
216 
“forests” as those dominated by tall-stature coniferous and/or deciduous trees 
217 
occurring at elevations above grasslands, pinyon-juniper woodlands, or chaparral 
218 
vegetation in the western U.S.

3.3 
Study inclusion criteria  
246 
 
247 
Potential studies were then evaluated for inclusion using the following specific 
248 
criteria: 
249 
 Relevant subject(s): forests of the USA, predominantly coniferous forests of the 
250 
West but information from any burned forests will be included. Experimental data 
251 
from less severe burns, such as prescribed fires, will be assessed for relevance. 
252 
Non-wildfire seeding data were summarized separately from wildfire data. 
253 
 Timeframe: There are multiple timeframes to consider. First, studies since the 
254 
review by Robichaud et al. (2000) will be exhaustively assessed for inclusion. 
255 
Second, any relevant studies from 1970-present will be included as appropriate, 
256 
especially if these studies were not included in previous reviews. References that 
257 
appear in the literature to relevant earlier research will be tracked down. 
258 
 Types of intervention: 
259 
o Seeding of herbaceous plants 
260 
o Seeding of shrubs 
261 
o Combinations of seeding in conjunction with other post-fire 
262 
rehabilitation activities such as mulching, water-bars, treefelling on 
263 
terrain contours, etc. 
264 
o Methods and timing of seed delivery 
265 
 Types of comparator: 
266 
o Replicated randomized experiments 
267 
o Before-after control-impact (BACI) studies 
268 
o Observational studies 
269 
o Expert opinion 
270 
 Types of outcome: 
271 
o Cover and biomass of herbaceous plants 
272 
o Cover and biomass of shrubs 
273 
o Cover and biomass of invasive non-native plants 
274 
o Plant community composition: nativity, richness, diversity 
275 
o Species selected for seeding (non-native and native) 
276 
o Soil stabilization variables 
277 
o Costs of seeding 
278 
 Types of study: 
279 
o Studies investigating effects of seeding after severe forest fires 
280 
 
281 
 
There is substantial heterogeneity in the forests of the USA, even among the 
282 
western forests where the greatest amount of information is likely to be found. 
283 
This heterogeneity is associated with the latitudinal and elevational gradients 
284 
where these forests occur and ecotones with adjacent ecosystems. Wildfires 
285 
burn heterogeneously as well and important post-fire effects can have a 
286 
stochastic component (e.g., erosion is not a simple function of terrain and fire 
287 
severity, but also of the chance of a strong rainstorm occurring soon after the 
288 
fire). There is heterogeneity in pre-existing propagule sources (seed bank) and 
289 
nearby sources. Finally, management interventions vary widely in terms of 
290 
the species selected for seeding and the timing and methods of seed delivery. 
291 
 
292 
 
We considered all types of studies, including replicated randomized 
293 
experiment, observational (multiple location case study), observational (single

location case study), monitoring report with quantitative data, monitoring report with 
295 
qualitative data, BACI, review papers, and expert opinions. All potentially relevant 
296 
publications were imported into a RefWorks reference manager database 
297 
(www.refworks.com).  Those publications listed as “possibly relevant” were 
298 
examined by the senior author for final inclusion decisions.   
299 
 
300 
3.4 
Study quality assessment 
301 
 
302 
We assigned “quality of evidence” ratings for each study based on design and 
303 
statistical robustness (Table 1).  Statistically robust data from replicated randomized 
304 
and controlled experiments were judged to be of “highest” quality; whereas 
305 
unreplicated, uncontrolled, qualitative data had “lowest” quality of evidence.

314 
We evaluated post-fire seeding effectiveness based on the treatment’s 
315 
effectiveness in reducing: 1) erosion and sedimentation, 2) non-native species 
316 
invasion, and 3) effects on native plant community recovery.  Studies were examined 
317 
for overall seeding treatment effectiveness or ecosystem impacts in each category

When available, quantitative data from seeded and unseeded treatments were 
325 
compared.  Some studies had multiple sites; we made comparisons based on the 
326 
number of sites rather than the total number of publications.  Each study or individual 
327 
site within a study was given an effectiveness rating (Table 3).  Studies/sites rated as 
328 
“no difference in effectiveness” were not statistically or perceivably different in their 
329 
effectiveness, whereas those judged to be “ineffective” were counter-productive in 
330 
their effectiveness to a specified impact category (e.g., effect was opposite of that 
331 
intended).

Criteria for rating seeding treatment effectiveness
Effectiveness Rating
Sufficient evidence exists to conclude that seeding was 
statistically or perceivably effective in decreasing erosion, 
increasing cover, or reducing non-native species invasions 
without negative effects  
Effective  
Sufficient evidence exists to conclude that seeding was effective 
under some but not all circumstances or seeding was effective, 
but with potentially negative ecosystem impacts  
Minimal effectiveness  
Sufficient information exists to conclude that seeding treatments 
in treated and untreated controls were not statistically or 
perceivably different in their effectiveness for increasing cover, 
reducing erosion, and/or reducing non-native species invasions  
No difference in 
effectiveness  
Sufficient evidence exists to conclude that seeding was 
statistically or perceivably different in effectiveness, where 
treatments were counter-productive in their effectiveness (e.g. 
effect was opposite of what was intended); potentially negative 
ecosystem impacts exist

Data extraction 
338 
 
339 
Qualitative data extracted from the reviewed papers included study design, 
340 
land and fire attributes, types of treatments, study results, and conclusions.  We 
341 
characterized plant species seeded as non-native or native, in most cases following the 
342 
author’s classifications from the paper.  However, lack of a widely accepted definition 
343 
of “native” (Jones, 2003) caused definitions to differ between papers.  Quantitative 
344 
data included soil and/or plant community attributes.  In cases where authors reported 
345 
results from the same fire in different papers, data from each paper were extracted 
346 
independently but the overlap in studies was noted.  
347 
 
348 
 
For consistency, each paper was reviewed by two members of the review 
349 
panel.  Reviewers did not evaluate papers they authored.  After all publications were

Approximately 19,455 studies were identified through the literature search.  
378 
The primary reviewer and search assistants narrowed down the number of relevant 
379 
papers using specified inclusion criteria (Section 3.3), which produced 143 studies 
380 
(Table 4).  Studies were imported into RefWorks and ranked based on overall 
381 
relevancy (1 = relevant, 2 = possibly relevant). Those publications listed as “possibly 
382 
relevant” were examined by the review coordinator for further inclusion decisions.  
383 
We identified 120 studies after the review coordinator examination.

401 
Our review produced 94 relevant papers. Considering the entire dataset (n = 
402 
94), replicated and randomized experiments made up the largest category (19%, Fig. 
403 
2).  In the more recent period, 2000-2009 (n = 57), there was a greater proportion of 
404 
replicated randomized experiments (46%), review papers (29%), and expert opinions 
405 
(27%) compared to 1970-1999.

Of the 94 relevant papers, 27 papers provided evidence regarding post-fire 
414 
seeding effects on soil erosion, 12 papers provided direct evidence regarding the role 
415 
of seeding in reducing non-native species, and 26 papers included data addressing 
416 
post-fire seeding effects on native plant recovery.  The remaining 29 papers were 
417 
considered review papers or expert opinions.

Study quality assessment  
420 
 
421 
Using quality of evidence criteria, during the time period between 1970 and 
422 
1999 (n = 37), 6 papers (16%) were of highest quality, 5 papers (14%) were high 
423 
quality, 4 papers (11%) were medium quality, and the majority (60%) were in the low 
424 
and lowest quality category (Fig. 3).  The proportion of papers in these categories 
425 
changed slightly for the 2000-2009 papers, with the greatest increase in the high 
426 
quality of evidence category (28%); 19% were of highest quality, 11% medium, 9% 
427 
low, and one-third (33%) fell into the lowest quality category (Fig. 3).

In the overall set of papers, a majority of information on seeding comes from 
435 
well designed experimental studies. However, in more recent years there has been 
436 
greater emphasis on study designs of quantitative experimental nature (Fig. 4).

4.4.1 Does seeding after severe forest fires in the western USA reduce soil erosion? 
446 
 
447 
 
Using effectiveness ratings (Table 3), 33% of the 27 studies showed seeding to 
448 
be effective, 26% showed minimal effectiveness or ineffectiveness, and 15% showed 
449 
no difference in effectiveness of seeding in reducing erosion.  However, the evidence 
450 
for seeding effectiveness drops substantially when quality of evidence criteria (Table 
451 
1) are considered: none of the four studies with highest quality evidence found 
452 
seeding to be effective or even minimally effective in reducing soil erosion when 
453 
compared to unseeded control plots.  For example, Robichaud et al. (2006), in a study 
454 
conducted in north-central Washington, used a randomized block design of four plots 
455 
with controls, replicated eight times, to compare the effects of seeding with winter 
456 
wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and fertilizing on post-fire erosion rates.  They found no 
457 
reduction in erosion rates for seeding or fertilization treatments, alone or in 
458 
combination, at any time during the four-year study.  Five of the eight studies with 
459 
high quality evidence found seeding to be ineffective, while two reported minimal 
460 
effectiveness.  The remaining study reported that seeding (seeded species unknown) 
461 
was effective for erosion reduction only in combination with mulching and log 
462 
erosion barriers on a fire in southwestern Colorado (DeWolfe et al., 2008). 
463 
 
464 
 
More evidence for seeding effectiveness was reported in studies with lower 
465 
quality evidence.  One of three medium quality studies, three of four low quality 
466 
studies, and all eight lowest quality studies found seeding to be effective or minimally 
467 
effective in reducing erosion.  For example, in a publication considered to have lowest 
468 
quality evidence, two subjectively-chosen study areas were set up within a single 
469 
burned area in the Black Hills, South Dakota, each with eight plots to assess

sedimentation and runoff (Orr, 1970).   The study found that a mixture of seeded non-
471 
native and legume species dominated the cover at both sites throughout the study and 
472 
suggested that neither site would have reached a 60% ground-cover requirement for 
473 
minimum soil stability within four years without seeding; however, no unseeded sites 
474 
were evaluated (Orr, 1970). 
475 
 
476 
 
None of the 16 papers published since 2000 concluded that seeding was 
477 
effective or minimally effective in reducing erosion compared to controls, whereas 
478 
64% of 11 papers published before 2000 found seeding to be in those categories.  
479 
Only 9% of earlier papers met the criteria for highest or high quality evidence, while 
480 
71% of papers since 2000 did.   
481 
 
482 
 
Several studies provide evidence that seeding for erosion control may be more 
483 
effective when done in concert with other treatments (Maloney and Thornton, 1995; 
484 
Meyer et al., 2001; Earles et al., 2005; DeWolfe et al., 2008), although other studies 
485 
showed no reduction in erosion rates (e.g. Robichaud et al., 2006).  Some studies 
486 
suggest that mulch treatments alone are more effective than seeding in reducing 
487 
erosion.  For example, in a study conducted in northwestern Montana, Groen and 
488 
Woods (2008) found straw mulch application at a rate of 2.24 Mg/ha resulted in 100% 
489 
ground cover and reduced rainsplash erosion by 87% in small test plots; whereas an 
490 
aerially seeded mixture of native grasses failed to provide enough ground cover to 
491 
reduce the erosion rate relative to untreated plots.  In studies conducted in Colorado’s 
492 
Front Range, MacDonald and Larson (2009) and Wagenbrenner et al. (2006) also 
493 
found straw mulch to be more effective than other treatments (seeding alone, seeding 
494 
and mulching, contour-felled logs, hydromulch, and polyacrylamide) for reducing soil 
495 
erosion following wildfires.  Seeded species in MacDonald and Larson (2009) 
496 
included native cultivars and sterile cereal grains, whereas Wagenbrenner et al. (2006) 
497 
tested a mixture of non-natives plus sterile and non-sterile cereal grains. 
498 
 
499 
4.4.2 Does seeding reduce non-native species invasions in severely burned forest 
500 
land?  
501 
 
502 
 
In 11 of 12 papers with direct evidence regarding the role of seeding in 
503 
reducing non-native species abundance, 56%  (6 papers) showed seeding to be 
504 
effective, whereas 45% (5 papers) showed seeding did not reduce non-native species’ 
505 
abundance.  Considering quality of evidence (Table 1), three of five papers (60%) of 
506 
highest quality showed seeding to be effective for reducing non-natives.  However, 
507 
two of those were conducted in prescribed burn or slash pile burned areas. Two of 
508 
three papers of high quality showed seeding to be ineffective for reducing non-native 
509 
species.  Thus, an equal amount of papers (50% each) found seeding to be effective 
510 
and ineffective.  The three lower quality-of-evidence categories likewise gave mixed 
511 
results.   
512 
 
513 
 
Of the studies showing seeding to be effective, 83% included non-native 
514 
annual species in the seeding treatments.  Eighty percent of ineffective treatments (5 
515 
papers) seeded non-native species, of which 60% seeded non-persistent species which 
516 
persisted beyond the 1st year post-fire and 40% (2 papers) found that seed mixes were 
517 
contaminated with exotics (Sexton, 1998; Hunter et al., 2006).  These same papers 
518 
and others showed that successful seeded species also displaced native species

(Sexton, 1998; Schoennagel and Waller, 1999; Barclay et al., 2004; Keeley, 2004;

Few studies have investigated the use of native species for reducing non-
523 
native species invasion, and only one of the three using native seed was conducted 
524 
after a wildfire.  Stella (in press) found that non-native species richness and 
525 
abundance did not differ among seeding treatments incorporating non-native and 
526 
native species mixes on three high-severity wildfires in Arizona.  The other studies 
527 
were conducted following a prescribed burn in northwestern Arizona (Springer et al., 
528 
2001) and following slash pile burning in northern Arizona (Korb et al., 2004).  
529 
Springer et al. (2001) found that seeding certified “weed-free” native seeds was 
530 
ineffective in reducing non-natives, whereas Korb et al. (2004) noted that seeding 
531 
native species was effective only with the addition of soil amendments.   
532 
 
533 
4.5.3 Does seeding after severe forest fires in the western USA affect native plant 
534 
community recovery? 
535 
 
536 
 
Twenty-six papers included data addressing post-fire seeding effects on native 
537 
plant recovery.  The majority (62%, 16 papers) showed decreased cover of native 
538 
species on seeded plots compared to unseeded, while 19% (5 papers) showing greater 
539 
native species cover on seeded plots.  Considering quality of evidence, 50% of the 
540 
highest quality papers (3 of 6) found that seeding reduced native cover, and the 
541 
remaining papers showed seeding to have no effect, minimal effect, or positive effect 
542 
on native cover.  Two out of 5 papers with high quality evidence found seeding 
543 
reduced native cover, while two stated seeding increased native cover and the other 
544 
showed minimal effect.  Six of seven papers (86%) rated as medium quality evidence 
545 
found that seeding reduced native cover, and 63% of the eight low and lowest quality 
546 
of evidence studies determined that seeding inhibited the return of native species.  
547 
  
548 
 
Of the highest and high quality evidence studies finding a reduction of native 
549 
plant cover with seeding (5 papers), three suggested that seeding could have persistent 
550 
effects on post-fire vegetation recovery.  For example, Stella (2009) found that annual 
551 
and biennial native forbs were significantly reduced in seeded treatments compared to 
552 
unseeded treatments the first year after fire; this reduction persisted into the second 
553 
year even though the cover of seeded species declined.  Another southwestern U.S. 
554 
study found a similar effect of seeding annual ryegrass (Lolium perenne ssp. 
555 
Multiflorum (Lam.) Husnot) on native forbs (Barclay et al., 2004): cover of native 
556 
forbs in unseeded areas increased from year one to year two, but native forb cover in 
557 
seeded areas remained constant even though ryegrass cover declined.  The third study, 
558 
conducted in the eastern Cascades, showed a reduction of native early-successional 
559 
species and fire-dependent colonizers as a result of high frequency and cover of 
560 
seeded non-natives.  The researchers suggested that seeding effects could therefore 
561 
alter native plant communities well beyond the life of the seeded species 
562 
(Schoennagel and Waller, 1999).   
563 
 
564 
 
Two studies with highest and high quality evidence found that seeding 
565 
enhanced native plant cover (Springer et al., 2001; Hunter and Omi, 2006).  Hunter 
566 
and Omi (2006) examined how seeded species (a mixture of native cultivars and non-
567 
native annual grasses) and native grasses responded to increased availability of soil 
568 
nitrogen and light after the Cerro Grande Fire in New Mexico.  They found that cover

16 
of native species (those not seeded during post-fire rehabilitation efforts) increased 
570 
over a four-year period in seeded areas of low fire severity and did not differ between 
571 
seeded and unseeded areas of high fire severity, although seeded grass cover remained 
572 
high.  However, seeding treatments did reduce native species richness, at least at 
573 
small scales (Hunter and Omi, 2006).   
574 
 
575 
 
Both seeded species and native plant cover are highly influenced by post-fire 
576 
precipitation.  When unfavorable conditions (e.g., low precipitation) occur, seeding 
577 
often has no effect on native species cover and/or recovery (Robichaud et al., 2006; 
578 
Wagenbrenner et al., 2006; Peterson et al., 2007).  In contrast, under favorable 
579 
conditions seeded species can rapidly dominate the post-fire environment, which in 
580 
turn may lead to low first-year native plant recruitment and subsequent reductions in 
581 
native species over time.  However, one long-term study revealed that 31 years after a 
582 
fire in north-central Washington, non-native cultivars which dominated seeded sites 
583 
initially were completely replaced by a diverse mixture of native graminoids, forbs, 
584 
shrubs and trees (Roche et al., 2008).  This study suggests that non-native grasses 
585 
seeded after wildfires do not always have persistent effects on native plant 
586 
communities, but long-term datasets like this one are rare.     
587 
 
588 
 
Seven of nine papers (78%) assessing the effect of seeding on native species 
589 
richness reported negative effects, while the remaining two showed no difference in 
590 
native species richness on seeded versus unseeded controls.   Eighty-six percent of the 
591 
papers providing highest and high quality evidence reported that seeding decreased 
592 
native species richness.  Two-thirds of these papers were published since 2000.   
593 
 
594 
 
Reduced native species richness is often a function of high dominance by 
595 
seeded species (Conard et al., 1991; Amaranthus et al., 1993; Sexton, 1998; 
596 
Schoennagel and Waller, 1999; Keeley, 2004).  In five cases, studies reported high 
597 
seeded species dominance coincident with reduced native species richness.  
598 
Conversely, Kruse et al. (2004) reported cereal barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cover 
599 
had no effect on native richness on a fire in northern California.  Instead, this study 
600 
linked reduced native species richness with cover of straw mulch, showing that direct 
601 
competition for water or nutrients with actively growing seeded species was not the 
602 
only way for a suppressive effect to occur (Kruse et al., 2004).   Barclay et al. (2004) 
603 
noted a reduction in native forb richness in the second year following fire in north-
604 
central New Mexico.  However, this reduction coincided with low seeded annual 
605 
ryegrass cover.  The authors suggested that dominant ryegrass cover may have led to 
606 
the suppression of native species in the first year, causing subsequent lack of 
607 
reproduction of native forbs in the second year after ryegrass disappeared.  However, 
608 
total cover was also reported to be low; thus, the relative abundance of seeded 
609 
ryegrass compared to other species may have remained high.  In the two studies 
610 
reporting no difference in native species richness between seeded and unseeded plots, 
611 
one showed minimal cover of seeded annual species in both the first and second year 
612 
post-fire in the Southwest (Stella, 2009).  The other found that although seeded non-
613 
native annual and perennial grass and legume species had high dominance (cover and 
614 
frequency) in seeded plots in the eastern Cascades, a native plant, pinegrass 
615 
(Calamagrostis rubescens Buckley), also dominated the site, which may have 
616 
counteracted any effects of seeded species abundance (Schoennagel, 1997).

A number of studies examined competitive effects of seeded grasses on woody 
619 
plant establishment.  The potential for seeded grasses to compete with woody plant 
620 
species can be viewed as positive or negative depending on the ecosystem or site 
621 
being rehabilitated.  Of 14 papers investigating post-fire seeding effects on tree 
622 
seedling growth and shrub cover, the majority (79%, 11 papers) found seeding to 
623 
negatively affect woody plant establishment.  All studies seeded only grasses in 
624 
treated plots.  Half of the papers providing highest or high quality evidence (2 out of 
625 
4) found that seeding negatively affected tree seedling and/or shrub growth and 
626 
survival.  One paper reported seeding had no effect on the growth and survival of 
627 
woody species, while the other showed seeding improved establishment. Eight out of 
628 
nine (89%) studies in the lower quality of evidence categories found reduced conifer 
629 
seedlings and/or shrub growth and survival on sites dominated by seeded annual non-
630 
native species (Griffin, 1982; Conard et al., 1991; Schoennagel and Waller, 1999;

4.5.1 Does seeding after severe forest fires in the western USA reduce soil erosion? 
636 
 
637 
 
Only nine of the 27 studies used direct measures of sediment yield from 30 
638 
seeded and unseeded sites to assess post-fire seeding effectiveness.  While seeded 
639 
sites tended to produce less sediment than unseeded sites the first year after fire (Fig. 
640 
5), only 22% of the sites showed a statistically significant decrease in erosion on 
641 
seeded relative to unseeded sites.  This largely non-significant trend toward sediment 
642 
yield reduction was less apparent in measurements from the second year post-fire and 
643 
essentially disappeared by the third and subsequent years.  However, by the third year 
644 
post-fire most studies showed little sediment movement in either seeded or unseeded 
645 
sites (Fig. 5), indicating that slopes had largely stabilized.

Sediment movement is strongly related to the amount of cover on a hillslope 
653 
(Robichaud et al. 2006; Rough 2007).  Because so few studies reported actual erosion 
654 
measurements, we also used vegetation cover as an indicator of seeding “success” for 
655 
potential erosion control effectiveness (Dadkhah and Gifford 1980; Bruggink 2007).  
656 
We included studies from the first and second year after fire that compared seeded 
657 
treatments to unseeded plots in this analysis.  As was done in Robichaud et al. (2000) 
658 
and Beyers (2004), we used two levels of cover to indicate the potential for seeding to 
659 
reduce erosion.  Cover > 30% was regarded as partially effective at reducing erosion, 
660 
and cover > 60%, which has been found to allow negligible sediment movement 
661 
(Noble 1965; Orr 1970), was considered to be effective.

studies containing a total of 29 study sites, we found that 41% of sites had 
665 
significantly greater total plant cover on seeded plots by the end of the first year after 
666 
fire.  Fifty-five percent of the seeded sites had > 30% total plant cover in the first year 
667 
after fire, compared to only 31% of the unseeded sites (Table 5).  Another 14% of 
668 
seeded sites had > 60% total plant cover after the first year post-fire compared to none 
669 
of the unseeded sites.  However, of the 12 sites where erosion was measured, none 
670 
showed that seeding significantly reduced erosion in the first year after fire.

In the second year after fire, seeded sites were nearly four times more likely to 
677 
be stabilized than untreated sites based on cover percentage (Table 5).  Second-year 
678 
seeded sites had greater total cover than did unseeded sites 39% of the time.  Eighty-
679 
three percent of the seeded sites had greater than 30% cover, compared to 50% of

681 
reduce soil erosion to negligible amounts, compared to only 6% (1 site) of unseeded 
682 
sites.  Despite these cover findings, only one of the studies measuring erosion in the 
683 
second year showed that seeding significantly reduced erosion.  Authors of all review 
684 
papers (4) agreed that research to date has failed to show any notable relationship 
685 
between establishment of vegetative cover and reduction of erosion within the first 
686 
year after fire (Beschta et al., 2004; Beyers, 2004; Wolfson and Sieg, in press).

Cover data from 15 studies containing 57 different study sites showed seeded 
699 
cover decreased significantly relative to control plot cover with increasing time since 
700 
fire (p = 0.0447, Fig. 6).  Total cover on seeded plots was more variable but only 
701 
slightly higher on average than total cover on control sites for two years post-fire; 
702 
after two years, control cover was consistently greater than seeded cover.  However, 
703 
of 13 sites with greater cover on seeded than unseeded sites in the first and/or second 
704 
year post-fire, the majority (77%, 10 sites) occurred in ecoregions characterized by 
705 
favorable rainfall intensity, amounts, and timing.  In addition, in all of these sites 
706 
annual cereal grains or non-native perennial grass species were either seeded alone 
707 
(62%, 8 sites) or as a predominant proportion of a mix with natives cultivars and 
708 
legumes (38%, 5 sites) (Anderson and Brooks, 1975; Griffin, 1982; Amaranthus,

Outcome of the review 
738 
 
739 
 
Our qualitative and quantitative analysis regarding seeding effectiveness for 
740 
reducing soil erosion showed similar results.  Seeding is largely ineffective in 
741 
reducing soil erosion.  However, quantitative analysis elucidated that seeding has the 
742 
ability to decrease sediment yield on seeded sites compared to unseeded sites in the 
743 
first year.  However, this decrease diminished with time since fire.  In addition, 
744 
seeding has the ability to increase cover but this increase does not ensure reduced 
745 
erosion. 
746 
 
747 
 
Regarding seeding affects on native plant communities, qualitative and 
748 
quantitative analysis each revealed unique information.  Qualitatively, papers showed 
749 
a decreased in cover of native species on seeded plots compared to unseeded plots.  
750 
Seeding treatments also showed to decrease native species richness, negative effects 
751 
on woody plant establishment, and persistent effects on native plant community 
752 
recovery.  Quantitatively, like soil erosion data, data regarding seeding effects on 
753 
native plant communities revealed that seeded cover decreased significantly relative 
754 
to control plots with increasing time since fire.  However, seeded and unseeded sites 
755 
supported essentially the same percent cover after five years.  Seeded species 
756 
increased in the first couple of years after fire but declined in subsequent years. 
757 
 
758 
 
Only qualitative evidence was gathered regarding seeding effectiveness in 
759 
curtailing non-native species invasion.  This analysis showed that seeding has 
760 
equivocal effectiveness in mitigating non-natives species.  However, of effective and 
761 
ineffective treatments, the majority included non-native annual species in the seeding,

5.1 
Evidence of effectiveness  
769 
 
770 
 
The systematic review approaches used worked well for summarizing both 
771 
qualitative and quantitative data while reducing review bias. Qualitative and 
772 
quantitative analysis elucidated differing but equally important information regarding 
773 
each review question and the soil and plant community attributes assessed.  
774 
Conclusions draw across qualitative and quantitative analysis were similar. 
775 
 
776 
5.1.1 Does seeding after severe forest fires in the western USA reduce soil erosion? 
777 
 
778 
 
Qualitative analysis of soil erosion papers revealed that as sampling designs 
779 
have become more rigorous in recent years, evidence that seeding is effective in 
780 
reducing erosion has decreased.  In addition, seeding may be more effective when 
781 
used with other erosion control measures, but mulching alone can provide as much or 
782 
more cover then all other treatment combined.  Quantitatively, it appears that greater 
783 
cover does not always produce less erosion.  However, our data suggest that seeding 
784 
was more likely to increase plant cover and therefore potentially reduce soil erosion in 
785 
the Marine and Mediterranean Regime Mountain ecoregions than in Temperate 
786 
Steppe Regime Mountains ecoregion (Table 5; see Fig. 1 for ecoregion boundaries).  
787 
A main goal of post-wildfire stabilization treatments is to reduce soil erosion in the 
788 
year immediately following a fire (Robichaud et al., 2000).  However, seeding 
789 
appears to have a low probability of effectively reducing erosion within the first year 
790 
and even the second year.   
791 
 
792 
 
793 
5.1.2  Does seeding reduce non-native species invasions in severely burned forest 
794 
land?  
795 
 
796 
 
Qualitatively, it appears that seeding has an equivocal record for reducing non-
797 
native species invasion.  Successful exclusion of non-natives was generally reported 
798 
when seeded species produced high cover (Barclay et al., 2004; Keeley, 2004), while 
799 
studies where seeding was ineffective usually showed no difference in total cover on 
800 
seeded and unseeded sites (Sexton, 1998; Hunter and Omi, 2006; Stella et al., in 
801 
press).  Successful suppression of non-seeded invaders appears to result from the 
802 
competitive advantage of other (seeded) non-native species (Schoennagel and Waller, 
803 
1999; Barclay et al., 2004; Keeley, 2004). 
804 
 
805 
 
Although the non-native annual species in seed mixes are generally selected 
806 
because they are expected to disappear in one year (e.g., winter wheat, annual 
807 
ryegrass), they can persist beyond the first and second years post-fire (VanZuuk, 
808 
1997; Sexton, 1998; Barclay et al., 2004, Hunter et al., 2006). In addition, it appears 
809 
that seeding to reduce the negative impacts of invading non-native species on post-fire 
810 
vegetation recovery may end up replacing one (or more) competitive non-native 
811 
species with another.

813 
 
Concerns over use of native species for post-fire seeding include the fact that 
814 
some native grasses have been shown to suppress growth of conifer seedlings (Larson 
815 
and Schubert, 1969; Pearson, 1972), and using non-local native seed sources may 
816 
contaminate local gene pools (Huenneke, 1991; Schmid, 1994; Linhart, 1995; Hufford 
817 
and Mazer, 2003; Rogers and Montalvo, 2004).  Conserving local genotypes of plant 
818 
populations is considered a vital mechanism by which plant communities can adapt 
819 
and evolve to survive in a changing climate (Huenneke, 1991, Rogers and Montalvo, 
820 
2004).  
821 
 
822 
 
All of the papers on the effectiveness of seeding for reducing non-native 
823 
species invasion in forested ecosystems were published since 1998.  This likely 
824 
reflects the increased interest in this kind of treatment by land management agencies.  
825 
Additional and longer-term quantitative monitoring is needed to more thoroughly 
826 
assess the effectiveness of seeding to prevent non-native species invasion after fire. 
827 
 
828 
5.1.3 Does seeding after severe forest fires in the western USA affect native plant 
829 
community recovery?  
830 
 
831 
 
Seeding treatment performance and effects are related to length of time since 
832 
fire (Robichaud and Elliot, 2006; Rough, 2007).  Quantitative analysis of cover data 
833 
from 15 studies containing 57 different study sites suggests that seeded species, in 
834 
particular annual cereal grains, may exit the system quickly (Kuenzi et al. 2008) or be 
835 
outcompeted by native or naturalized species after two years.  However, data beyond 
836 
two years from areas seeded with annual cereal grains are rare, so studies quantifying 
837 
their ability for rapid die-off are limited.   
838 
 
839 
 
The higher initial seeded cover in the analysis of cover data from 57 sites 
840 
suggests that one of the major goals of post-fire rehabilitation was being effectively 
841 
met: seeded species established quickly and lasted for a few years, then decreased 
842 
relative to other species.  However, total cover in seeded sites and controls was nearly 
843 
identical by years four and five, suggesting that the remaining seeded species were 
844 
offsetting local plant species that would otherwise occupy the site.  Regardless of 
845 
species seeded, total cover values converged at four to five years post-fire, suggesting 
846 
that ecosystems may only support a threshold level of plant cover (Connell and 
847 
Slatyer, 1977; Noble and Slatyer, 1977) and post-fire seeding actually suppresses the 
848 
establishment of local species after fires (Anderson and Brooks, 1975; Schoennagel 
849 
and Waller, 1999; Sexton, 1998; Barclay et al., 2004; Keeley, 2004).  Data from this 
850 
review cannot assess the differences in vegetation composition between seeded and 
851 
non-seeded sites.  Longer-term monitoring results (e.g., > 5 years) are needed to 
852 
assess lasting impacts of seeded species.  Assessment of soil seed banks is also 
853 
needed to determine whether seed of non-persistent seeded species can remain viable 
854 
within the seed bank (Griffin 1982). 
855 
 
856 
 
Overall, both qualitative and quantitative data from the literature suggests that 
857 
seeded species’ dominance plays a critical role in determining species richness in the 
858 
first and/or second year after fire.  In cases where seeding is successful, reduced 
859 
native species richness is likely.  In cases where seeding is successful, reduced native 
860 
species richness is a likely result.  Mulching may also inhibit native species recovery 
861 
as much as seeding (Schuman et al., 1991; Bakker et al., 2003; Kruse et al., 2004), as

25 
well having the potential to introduce non-species if the mulch used is not free of 
863 
weeds (Kruse et al., 2004). 
864 
 
865 
 
Overall, both qualitative and quantitative results on seeding effects on woody 
866 
plant establishment suggest that seeding non-native annual species may negatively 
867 
affect woody plant seedlings through competition for available resources (specifically 
868 
soil moisture), space, and light during the first two years after fire (Beyers, 2004).Soil 
869 
moisture likely influences establishment and survival of trees and shrubs, and soil 
870 
moisture can be depleted more rapidly on seeded sites yielding high plant production, 
871 
thus limiting water availability to woody plant species (Elliott and White, 1987).  For 
872 
example, Amaranthus et al. (1993) found that seeded annual ryegrass suppressed first-
873 
year pine seedling growth in southwestern Oregon by lowering soil moisture 
874 
availability and reducing root-tip and mycorrhiza formation.  In contrast, Sexton 
875 
(1998) noted no difference in tree and shrub seedling establishment on plots seeded 
876 
with annual ryegrass versus controls in south-central Oregon, in spite of similar soil 
877 
moisture levels on seeded and control plots.  A prescribed burn study in northwestern 
878 
Arizona found increased shrub cover on seeded plots, but shrubs were included in the 
879 
seeding treatment (Springer et al., 2001).  
880 
 
881 
5.2 
Reasons for variation in effectiveness  
882 
 
883 
 
Results obtained from qualitative and quantitative analysis did not vary so 
884 
much as provided unique information which we used to make overall conclusions 
885 
regarding each review question.  The qualitative analysis used less rigorous statistical 
886 
methods; thus the quantitative analysis produced more reliable conclusions.  
887 
However, we feel that both analyses were equally important in determining the 
888 
overall effects and effectiveness of post-fire seeding practices on soils and plant 
889 
communities in forested ecosystems in the western USA. 
890 
 
891 
5.3 
Review limitations  
892 
 
893 
 
A systematic review may become a statistically rigorous ‘‘meta-analysis’’ if 
894 
data can be analyzed as ‘‘effect sizes’’ (Gates, 2002).  However, measurements taken 
895 
across studies relevant to soil and/or plant community attributes varied widely 
896 
therefore a meta-analyses for the data obtained was not possible with the questions we 
897 
addressed. In addition, due to the variation in data measures across papers, data 
898 
gathered often yielded small sample sizes.  Thus, conclusions drawn from quantitative 
899 
analysis, in these cases, must be considered cautiously.  
900 
 
901 
 
Finally, we did not complete a ‘kappa’ analysis of agreement between 
902 
reviewers as to the inclusion of studies within the review. Two persons were involved 
903 
in this process and worked to an agreed set of papers. The inability to quote a kappa 
904 
statistic weakens the review as the selection of studies for inclusion is a potential 
905 
source of unquantifiable bias.

Reviewers’ Conclusions 
913 
 
914 
6.1 
Implications for management / policy / conservation 
915 
 
916 
 
The scientific literature and monitoring data show that post-fire seeding is not 
917 
reliably effective in protecting soil in the short term and can have negative 
918 
consequences for native plant recovery, particularly woody species.  Seeding with 
919 
annual non-native species can be effective in curtailing invasive non-natives.  
920 
However, seeding with these species is often associated with slower native plant 
921 
recovery.  Land managers should weigh the cost/benefit of seeding treatments and 
922 
consider using alternative rehabilitation methods shown to be more effective (e.g., 
923 
various types of mulch, but care must be taken to ensure that mulch is free of non-
924 
native seed).  Early detection of new undesirable species invasions through 
925 
monitoring post-fire environments, in combination with rapid response methods to 
926 
quickly contain, deny reproduction, and eliminate these invasions, may allow better 
927 
control of non-native species establishment than is typically obtained through seeding.  
928 
Plant community recovery may be improved with the use of locally-adapted, 
929 
genetically appropriate plant materials, although more research regarding the effects 
930 
and effectiveness of these species is critical.   
931 
 
932 
6.2 
Implications for research 
933 
 
934 
 
The effectiveness and long-term effects of post-fire seeding deserve further 
935 
study, particularly well-designed research experiments and rigorous quantitative 
936 
monitoring.  Priority should be given to research on the effects of using native and 
937 
annual/hybrid cereal grain species on burned landscapes, especially studies which 
938 
look at longer-term effects on native plant community recovery and possible 
939 
reburning potential.  Further research on the genetic implications of using non-local 
940 
genotypes of native species for postfire seeding is also essential.  To avoid questions 
941 
of genetic contamination in seeding projects, there is a need develop strategies and 
942 
techniques to enhance supplies of local genotype plant materials.  Growers and 
943 
agencies should work to find common ground on the genetic classification of local 
944 
plant materials in demand so that supplies can be developed accordingly.  
945 
Researching and establishing guidelines for appropriate seed transfer zones for 
946 
species useful for post-fire stabilization and rehabilitation will help protect the genetic 
947 
integrity of locally-adapted species.
