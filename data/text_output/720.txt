Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of
the southwestern United States have higher
stand densities and basal areas at present than
they had prior to Euro-American settlement
(pre-1876; hereafter referred to as “presettle-
ment”) (Allen et al. 2002, Moore et al. 2004).
The altered forest structure has led to many
critical conservation problems, including loss
of native plant diversity and productivity (Bak -
ker and Moore 2007, Laughlin et al. 2011) and
increased severity of wildfire (Covington and
Moore 1994). Tree thinning and prescribed fire
are common practices for reducing the severity
of wildfires in forests adapted to low-severity,
frequent-fire regimes. Currently, there is in -
creased interest in adopting thinning-and-burn-
ing methods that incorporate ecological restora-
tion principles (as defined by SER 2004) to
promote overall forest health while still meet-
ing fuels reduction objectives (Covington et al.
1997, Roccaforte et al. 2010). However, the
effectiveness of such ecological restoration
treatments in native understory recovery has
not been conclusively demonstrated.
Historical reconstruction of forest structure
through the use of site-specific evidence from
a predetermined time period (e.g., pre-Euro–
American settlement) is one technique for

NATIVE PLANTS DOMINATE UNDERSTORY VEGETATION FOLLOWING
PONDEROSA PINE FOREST RESTORATION TREATMENTS

ABSTRACT.—Dense ponderosa pine forests in the southwestern United States inhibit understory production and diver-
sity and are susceptible to high-severity wildfire. Restoration treatments involving overstory thinning and prescribed
burning are being implemented to increase understory productivity and diversity and to reduce the risk of severe wild-
fire. However, disturbances associated with treatments may favor invasion of nonnative species, and the severity of the
disturbance may be related to the level of nonnative species establishment. We examined understory community com-
position, species richness, and plant cover responses to 3 stand-scale replicates of 4 different tree-thinning intensities.
Restoration treatments altered the composition of the understory community regardless of thinning intensity. Under-
story richness and cover were highly variable among experimental blocks, but we observed strong trends of increasing
richness and cover in the treated stands. Immediately following restoration treatments, nonnative species cover com-
prised 6% of the total cover where treatment-induced disturbances were the greatest. However, the initial increase in
nonnative species did not persist and was reduced by half 6 years after treatment. Plant community composition was
still in flux by the sixth year after treatment, indicating that continued monitoring is necessary for evaluating whether
restoration targets are maintained over time.
RESUMEN.—Los densos bosques de pino ponderosa en el suroeste de los E.U.A. inhiben la producción y diversidad
del sotobosque y son propensos a incendios severos. El raleo del dosel y la quema controlada se están implementando
como tratamientos de restauración para incrementar la productividad y diversidad del sotobosque y para reducir el
peligro de incendios severos. Sin embargo, las perturbaciones asociadas con estos tratamientos podrían favorecer la
invasión por especies no nativas, y la severidad de la perturbación puede estar relacionada con el nivel de establecimiento
de estas especies. Examinamos la reacción del sotobosque con respecto a la composición de sus comunidades, a la riqueza
de especies y a la cobertura de la vegetación, a tres réplicas a nivel de rodal de cuatro distintas intensidades de raleo.
Los tratamientos de restauración cambiaron la composición de la comunidad del sotobosque independientemente de la
intensidad del raleo. La riqueza y la cobertura del sotobosque variaron mucho entre las áreas estudiadas, pero observamos
marcadas tendencias de mayor riqueza y cobertura en los rodales que recibieron el tratamiento. Inmediatamente
después de los tratamientos de restauración, la cobertura de especies invasoras constituía el 6% de la cobertura total
donde las perturbaciones producidas por los tratamientos fueron más grandes. No obstante, el aumento inicial en la
cobertura de especies invasoras no persistió, y se redujo a la mitad en un lapso de seis años después del tratamiento.
La composición de las comunidades de plantas aun seguía cambiando en el sexto año después del tratamiento, lo cual
indica que será preciso el monitoreo continuo para determinar si se lograron las metas de restauración.

developing restoration prescriptions (Hobbs
and Norton 1996, Moore et al. 1999). Trees are
thinned to replicate historical forest structure
and are burned to remove excessive fuels, pro-
mote understory productivity, and stimulate
soil nutrient cycling (hereafter thinning-and-
burning treatments are referred to as “restora-
tion treatments”). Tree density is determined
by extant historical evidence (old growth trees,
snags, stumps) with an additional number of
younger trees retained to replace historical
trees that may not have left evidence and trees
that might be lost during and after treatment
implementation. In northern Arizona, several
studies have used stocking rates of 150%–300%
of historical evidence in order to reduce fuel
loads and the potential for crown fire, as well
as to increase herbaceous diversity and pro-
duction (Fulé et al. 2005, Laughlin et al. 2006,
Moore et al. 2006, McGlone et al. 2009b). There
are, however, ecological reasons for maintain-
ing higher numbers of trees in some areas
(e.g., to provide wildlife habitat), as well as
political and social constraints associated with
thinning in protected lands such as na tional
parks. Furthermore, achieving 150%–300%
stock ing rates can require intensive tree re -
moval, which can be expensive, logistically
challenging (Fulé et al. 1997, Mast et al. 1999),
and damaging to the soil profile (Korb et al.
2007). Reduced levels of tree thinning may
accomplish the desired ecological goals, such
as reduced crown fire risk, while preserving
habitat for dense-forest–dwelling species, facili-
tating implementation on protected lands,
and reducing the cost of implementation.
Whether retaining more trees will achieve the
goal of increasing native understory produc-
tion and diversity is unclear. The structure and
composition of understory communities follow-
ing restoration treatments in ponderosa pine
forest are often influenced by thinning inten-
sity (Ab ella and Covington 2004) and the level
of disturbance generated during treatment
implementation (Wienk et al. 2004, Mc Glone
et al. 2009b). Restoration treatments can also
have the unintended consequence of promot-
ing in vasion and potential community domi-
nance of nonnative species (McGlone et al.
2009a).
To better understand the relationship of tree-
thinning intensity to understory abundance
and richness, we established a fully-rep licated,
stand-scale thinning-and-burning exp eriment
that included 4 levels of tree thinning followed
by prescribed fire. We hypothesized that (1)
there would be a strong positive relationship
between tree-thinning intensity and understory
plant richness and abundance, and (2) there
would be a strong positive relationship between
increased tree thinning and nonnative species
abundance.
METHODS
Study Area
This research was conducted within and
adjacent to the Fort Valley Experimental For-
est, a 2003-ha mixed-age ponderosa pine re -
serve located approximately 15 km northwest
of Flagstaff, Arizona, in the Coconino National
Forest (35°1619N, 111°4122W). Elevation
of the study area is 2250 m with slope gra -
dients <25%. Soils are a basalt-derived com-
plex of fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Argiborolls
and Mollic Eutroboralfs (Miller et al. 1995).
The average annual temperature is 7.5 °C.
Long-term (50-year) average annual precipita-
tion is 57 cm (Moore et al. 2006). Precipitation
patterns for the region are typically bimodal,
with approximately half of the precipitation
occurring as rain in July and August and half
as snow in the winter (NOAA 2005). Drought
conditions prevailed during the study period
(particularly in 2002), with mean annual pre-
cipitation at 43.3 cm.
Vegetation at the study site is dominated by
Pinus ponderosa, consisting of groups of ma -
ture, presettlement trees intermixed with nu -
merous dense thickets of smaller-diameter
trees. Pretreatment tree density in 1998 was
approximately 1156 trees ⋅ha–1, compared to
an estimated density of 140 trees ⋅ha–1 prior
to European settlement, circa 1876 (Korb et
al. 2007).
Experimental Design and
Restoration Treatments
In 1998, we established 3 experimental
blocks, each containing 4 thinning-intensity
treatment units of approximately 14 ha. Each
unit within the blocks was randomly assigned
a treatment. Tree-thinning intensity was based
on historical reconstruction of site-specific over -
story density and spatial arrangement. Thin -
ning treatment protocol retained all living
presettlement trees (Covington and Moore
1994, Fulé et al. 2001). In addition, differing

numbers of post-1876 trees were retained as
replacements for remnant evidence of missing
presettlement trees (e.g., snags, logs, stumps).
Replacement trees were retained at the follow-
ing levels: (a) 1.5–3 trees per remnant preset-
tlement evidence (high-intensity thinning), (b)
2–4 trees per remnant presettlement evidence
(medium-intensity thinning), (c) 3–6 trees per
remnant presettlement evidence (low-inten-
sity thinning), and (d) no thinning (control). All
thinned units were also treated with broadcast-
prescribed fire. Treatment units were thinned in
1999 and burned in spring 2000 (block 3) and
spring 2001 (blocks 1 and 2). Following treat-
ment, tree density was significantly different
among thinning treatments, with the high-in -
tensity thinning treatments having the lowest
densities (Korb et al. 2007). Soil disturbances
were highly variable among each block as a
result of different harvesting methods, with
block 3 having the highest soil disturbance
(Korb et al. 2007).
Field Methods
Prior to treatment, we established 20 per-
manent monitoring plots in each of the 12
treatment units (20 plots × 3 blocks × 4 treat-
ment units = 240 total plots). Individual plots
were placed systematically on a 60-m grid,
with a random starting point for the grid. Sam-
pling protocol for herbaceous vegetation was
modified from the National Park Service fire-
monitoring protocol (USDI NPS 2003). Each
plot contained one 50-m point-line intercept
transect oriented parallel to the prevailing
slope and centered on plot center. Herbaceous
plants were recorded at points located every
30 cm along each transect for a total of 166
points per plot. We estimated plant foliar cover
(%) by dividing the number of plant occur-
rences along the transect by 166 points. In
addition, a complete species list of all herba-
ceous plants was recorded within a 10 × 50-m
(500-m2) belt transect using the point-line inter-
cept transect as the midline. We sampled vege-
tation during July and August of 1998, 2001,
2002, and 2006. Taxonomic nom enclature and
species nativity were based on the USDA
Plants Database (USDA NRCS 2009). Taxa that
could not be reliably identified to species in
the field were only identified to genus. Tree
canopy cover was measured using a vertical
densitometer every 3 m along the point-line
intercept transect. All other tree measurements
were taken within a 400-m2 (11.28-m radius)
circular fixed-area plot.
Statistical Analyses
We used nonmetric multidimensional scal-
ing (NMS) to examine changes in understory
community composition over time and among
experimental treatments (Clarke 1993). Com-
munity composition matrices were summa-
rized for each treatment unit (n = 3) in each
sampling year. A frequency value was calcu-
lated for each species by summing its pres-
ence across belt transects within a treatment
unit and then dividing by 20, the total num-
ber of transects within the unit. We omitted
species that occurred on <5% of the treatment
units from the ordination and from an alyses
of species composition (McCune and Grace
2002). We ran the ordination using the Bray–
Curtis distance measure, random starting con-
figurations, 100 runs with real data, a maxi-
mum of 100 iterations per run, and a stability
criterion of 0.00001. The final solution was
compared to random solutions by using a
Monte Carlo test with 9999 randomizations.
All ordinations were conducted using PC-ORD
software (version 5.10; McCune and Mefford
2006).
We tested for differences in pretreatment
(1998) and final (2006) community composi-
tion among treatments using permutational
MANOVA (PerMANOVA; Anderson 2001),
with Bray–Curtis dissimilarity as our distance
measure (Faith et al. 1987) and 9999 permuta-
tions. PerMANOVA was conducted using PC-
ORD software (version 5.10; McCune and Mef-
ford 2006). The test for a time × treatment in -
teraction was assessed by calculating the mul -
tivariate dissimilarity (Bray–Curtis distance)
from 1998 to 2006 for each treatment unit.
This calculation produced a univariate response
variable that we analyzed with a Kruskal-Wal-
lis test and post hoc Wilcoxon’s 2-sample tests
for pairwise comparisons (JMP software, ver-
sion 8.0; SAS Institute, Inc. 2004). A signifi-
cant result from these tests would indicate
that the treatment with greater dissimilarity
experienced a greater change in community
composition between 1999 and 2006.
Indicator species analysis (ISA) was used to
explain the results of the PerMANOVA by iden-
tifying which species were most abundant and
most frequent within treatments in a particu-
lar year (Dufrêne and Legendre 1997). An

in dicator value (INDVAL) is the product of the
relative abundance and relative frequency (cal -
culated by species presence on number of belt
transects). Species were considered significant
indicators of the treatment if the indicator value
(INDVAL) was >25 and if the P-value was
<0.05 (calculated using Monte Carlo randomi -
zations). An INDVAL of 25 would occur, for
example, if a species occurred on 50% of the
belts in a group and had a relative abundance
of at least 50% in that group. ISA was con-
ducted using PC-ORD software (version 5.10;
McCune and Mefford 2006).
We analyzed posttreatment differences of
understory richness and cover among treat-
ments in 2006 with analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA). Pretreatment condition was used
as a covariate, and the ANCOVA was followed
by Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD)
post hoc multiple comparisons test. All rich-
ness and cover data met the assumptions of
normality and homogeneity of variance based
on the Shapiro–Wilk test and Levene’s test,
respectively. Differences in thinning levels were
assessed at α = 0.1. These tests were con-
ducted using JMP software (Version 8.0; SAS
Institute, Inc. 2004). We used linear regression
to analyze the relationships among tree char-
acteristics and understory responses. To facilitate
examination of localized variability in treatment
responses, we also present understory richness
and cover for each block.
RESULTS
We detected 203 vascular plant species
across treatment units in 1998–2006, with 168
species remaining after application of the 5%
filter. Plant community composition was simi-
lar among treatments in 1998 prior to treat-
ment (PerMANOVA: P = 0.62). After treatment,
plant community composition in the 3 thin-
ning treatments diverged marginally from the
control (P = 0.10), but no differences were de -
tected between thinned units. The net change
in composition from 1998 to 2006 was margin-
ally greater among treated units compared to
control units (P = 0.10). The NMS ordinations
showed little compositional change in the con-
trol units over time and a greater change in the
treated units, though all 3 treatments had simi-
lar magnitudes of change over time (Fig. 1).
No species had strong indicator values
(INDVAL > 50) in any year or treatment

tion had 2 dimensions and represented 93% of the variation of the Bray–Curtis distance matrix (stress 9.1, P = 0.0001).

(Table 1). Even before treatment, none of the
units had significant indicator values, and the
control and low intensity units never produced
more than 2. After treatment, there was an
increase in the number of species with signifi-
cant indicator values in both the medium- and
high-intensity treatments (Table 1). In the first
2 posttreatment years, the medium- and high-
intensity treatments had primarily nonnative
species with significant indicator values. By
2006, only one nonnative species (Linaria dal-
matica) had a significant indicator value in the
medium-intensity treatment (Table 1). No non -
natives were significant indicator species in
the control or low-intensity treatment in any
year or prior to treatment in any treatment
unit (Table 1).
Total species richness was significantly dif-
ferent among treatments (P = 0.043) in 1998
before treatment and after treatment in 2006
(P = 0.08), though no differences were detec -
ted among the multiple comparisons test (Ta -
ble 2). The lack of detectable significant dif -
ferences in the multiple comparisons test is
likely an artifact of the low sample size and high
variability in the data. There were strong trends
in the data, with greater species richness in
the treated units than in the control units

(Table 2). Examination of data from the indi-
vidual blocks shows a varied response to treat-
ment intensity, but, as with the overall analy-
sis, species richness was always greater in the
treated units than in the control units (Table
2). Species richness was positively re lated to
both the percent change in canopy cover (r2
= 0.27, P < 0.0001) and basal area (r2 = 0.38,
P < 0.0001) as a result of tree removal. By the
last 2 years of measurement, 2002 and 2006,
nonnative species represented <9% of the
total species richness across all treated units,
and by 2006 nonnative species richness was
similar among all treatments (P = 0.25).
Total plant cover was not significantly dif-
ferent among treatments in 1998 before treat -
ment (P = 0.42) or in 2006 after treatment
(P = 0.34), even though total plant cover more
than doubled in the low-intensity units and
more than quadrupled in the high-intensity
units as compared to the control units (Table 2).
Native graminoid cover represented 95% of
the total cover across all treatments. By 2006,
graminoid cover had increased more than
470% in the high-intensity units and 53% in
the control units compared to pretreatment
measurements. Examination of data from
the individual blocks shows a varied response
to treatment intensity, but, as with the over-
all analysis, total cover was always greater in
the treated units than in the control units
(Table 2). Plant cover was positively corre-
lated to both the percent change in canopy
cover (r2 = 0.24, P < 0.0001) and the tree
basal area (r2 = 0.28, P < 0.0001). By 2002
and 2006, the nonnative cover, as a propor-
tion of total plant cover, represented <6% of
the total cover across all treated units, and
was not significantly different among treat-
ments (P = 0.20).
DISCUSSION
Restoration treatments altered the compo-
sition of the ponderosa pine forest understory
regardless of thinning intensity. However, the
observed trend toward increasing species rich-
ness in the treated units was not significant.
This result differs from other restoration treat-
ments in ponderosa pine ecosystems where
sig nificant increases in species richness were
observed (Metlen and Fiedler 2006, Moore et
al. 2006, Laughlin and Fulé 2008). Nonnative
species were an important component of the
plant community immediately following the
treatments. Within 2 years after treatment, 50%
and 45% of the indicator species in the med -
ium- and high-intensity units, respectively, were
nonnative species. However, this initial pulse
of nonnative species was transient. Six years
after treatment, nonnative species were only a
minor component of the community. Only one
nonnative species, Linaria dalmatica, remained
as an indicator 6 years following restoration
treatments, while the rest of the indicators
were native perennials. Furthermore, L. dal-
matica is the only nonnative species we de -
tected that is listed as noxious by the state of
Arizona (USDA NRCS 2009). By 2006, L. dal -
matica had a mean foliar cover of <2% across
all treated units, although it was found on 67%
of the treated plots.
There was a strong trend toward higher plant
cover after restoration treatments, although
plant cover on treatment units did not differ
significantly from that on control units. Several
studies have reported much larger changes
within the first few years after restoration
treatments than the changes we observed at
Fort Valley (Laughlin et al. 2006, Moore et al.
2006). The lack of a statistically significant in -
crease in native cover may be an artifact of the

high levels of localized variability following res -
toration treatments. Given the known inverse
relationship between herbaceous productivity
and forest structure (Moore and Deiter 1992),
we expected larger increases in understory
co ver across the entire study site in response
to increased thinning intensity. Other studies
have suggested that tree basal area needs to
be re duced to 10 m2 ⋅ha–1 or less before a sig-
nificant increase in herbaceous production can
occur (Uresk and Severson 1989, Sabo et al.
2009). Basal area at our site was reduced to 22.3
m2 ⋅ha–1 in low-intensity units, 17.9 m2 ⋅ha–1
in medium-intensity units, and 15.6 m2 ⋅ha–1
in high-intensity units. It is reasonable to
assume that we failed to reduce basal area to
an appropriate threshold to induce the desired
increase in understory plant cover.
Our results suggest that disturbances asso-
ciated with restoration treatments can facili-
tate the establishment of nonnative species,
although the increased presence of nonnatives
does not necessarily result in a persistent in -
vasion. Restoration treatments did promote an
increase in nonnative species cover, but by 6
years posttreatment, the nonnative cover rep-
resented <6% of the total cover across all
treated units. Other studies have shown large
increases in nonnative species cover in north-
ern Arizona ponderosa pine forests following
thinning-and-burning treatments (Griffis et al.
2001, Fulé et al. 2005, McGlone et al. 2009a).
Generally, however, severe nonnative plant en-
c roachment into postfire ponderosa pine forests,
whether intentionally thinned and burned or
burned in wildfires, occurs in areas near the
lower ecotone with drier and warmer low-ele-
vation ecosystems (Crawford et al. 2001, Laugh-
lin and Fulé 2008, McGlone et al. 2009b).
Burned ponderosa pine forests at higher ele-
vations typically experience relatively low lev-
els of nonnative plant encroachment (Huisinga
et al. 2005, Kuenzi et al. 2008, Fornwalt 2010).
A notable exception, however, occurred at
the Leroux Fire in northern Arizona, where
high-severity burns resulted in a high abun-
dance of Linaria dalmatica 2 years after the
fire (Dodge et al. 2008). The high-severity areas
on the Leroux Fire are potentially analogous
to the slash pile burn scars at the Fort Valley
restoration project. Two growing seasons after
burning, the slash pile scars had signifi-
cantly higher nonnative plant cover compared
to burned areas away from the slash piles.
Furthermore, L. dalmatica was one of the domi-
nant nonnatives associated with the postburn
slash piles (Korb et al. 2004). While our study
did not detect a persistent invasion by nonna-
tives, the risk of encroachment was, and may
still be, a concern since we did find slightly
higher occurrences of nonnative species across
all treated areas.
Conclusion
The primary goals for the Fort Valley restora-
tion project were to reduce tree densities to
historical levels, increase native herbaceous
production and diversity, and reduce fire haz-
ards. Understory richness and cover was posi-
tively correlated with the reduction in tree
basal area, and showed a trend toward increas-
ing plant cover with increasing thinning intensi -
ties. Pine basal area may not have been re duced
below the threshold necessary to generate a
significant increase in understory cover.
All treatment units are presently dominated
by native species 6 years after treatment. Ini-
tial posttreatment increases in nonnative species
suggested that Fort Valley was at risk of inva-
sion. By the sixth year after treatment, how-
ever, nonnative species had been reduced to a
minor component of the understory, suggest-
ing that the invasion risk is highly diminished.
Furthermore, our results suggest that the plant
community has not stabilized, as changes are
likely still occurring 6 years after treatments. A
long-term monitoring program is essential to
assessing whether observed patterns are suc-
cessional or persistent changes, as community
change occurs slowly in semiarid climates of
the Southwest.
