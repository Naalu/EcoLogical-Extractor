Abstract—The Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) can be useful
indicators of ecosystem change as a result of a disturbance event. We
monitored changes in butterfly abundance in two restoration treat-
ment units paired with adjacent untreated forest at the Mt. Trumbull
Resource Conservation Area in northern Arizona. Restoration treat-
ments included thinning trees to density levels comparable to
densities at the time of Euro-American settlement, and reintroduc-
ing a low to medium intensity fire to the system. One unit was
treated in 1996, the second in 1998. Butterfly communities, nectar
availability, and herbaceous species richness were compared be-
tween treated and adjacent control forests, and between 3-year
posttreatment and 1-year posttreatment forests. Butterfly species
richness and abundance were two and three times greater, respec-
tively, in restoration treatment units than in adjacent control
forests. Nectar plant species richness ranged from two to 10 times
greater in restoration treatment units than in adjacent control
forests. Comparison of the 3-year posttreatment unit with the 1-year
posttreatment unit showed little difference in butterfly species
richness and abundance, although no statistical comparisons can be
made due to sample size. These restoration treatments offer a
unique opportunity to study responses to and recovery from distur-
bance and restoration at a landscape level.
Introduction ____________________
Current studies and methods of ecosystem restoration are
often focused on structural components, such as overstory or
understory plant composition, and not on functional pro-
cesses, such as nitrogen cycling, plant pollination, and/or
trophic level interactions (but see Kaye 1997; Covington and
others 1997). As a result, ecosystem restoration often over-
looks invertebrates as important components necessary for
ecosystem function and process. This emphasis on ecosys-
tem structure is primarily a result of limited available
information. Historical records were often inventories of
merchantable resources and did not describe how species
interacted with each other, or what processes were impor-
tant to ecosystem functioning (for example, Dutton 1882).
Butterfly Response and Successional
Change Following Ecosystem Restoration
Amy E. M. Waltz

Knowledge of ecosystem function and process can be ob-
tained from studying current-day undisturbed ecosystems
(Leopold 1949), although few if any “undisturbed” ecosys-
tems exist. In addition, historical function and process can
be inferred by studying function and process in experimen-
tally restored ecosystems (Leopold 1949).
In ponderosa pine forests in the Southwest, forest struc-
ture can be reconstructed from presettlement remnants and
historical records (Covington and Moore 1994; Fulé and
others 1997). This information is limited to overstory spe-
cies, with some information on herbaceous components also
available from early land surveys (Dutton 1882) and phytolith
studies (Rovner 1971; Bozarth 1993; Fisher and others 1995;
Fredlund and Tieszen 1997). These data show that South-
west forests prior to Euro-American settlement had lower
tree densities than current forests (50–150 trees per hectare
(tph) in 1870 versus 500–3,000 tph in 1994, Covington and
Moore 1994) with grassy openings. Experimental restora-
tion of these forests has been initiated using thinning to
reduce current tree densities and reintroducing fire.
Restoration in ponderosa pine is hypothesized to impact
all components of the ecosystem, including arthropods. The
change from a closed-canopy forest with little or no herba-
ceous understory community to an open forest with a domi-
nant herbaceous community results in plant diversity and
plant production increases (Covington and others 1997;
Springer and others, this proceedings). This in turn can
result in increases in the abundance and diversity of herbi-
vore arthropods (Erhardt and Thomas 1991). In addition,
restored forests show increases in soil moisture and soil
temperature when compared to control forests (Covington
and others 1997); both factors directly influence the success
rate of arthropod pupation (Erhardt and Thomas 1991;
Scoble 1992).
The Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) can be excellent
indicators of herbaceous community diversity and composi-
tion (Gilbert 1984; Erhardt 1985; Kremen 1994; Sparrow
and others 1994). Both butterflies and moths can be host-
specific as larvae, but become nectar generalists as adults,
encompassing a broad range of ecological niches. Changes in
butterfly diversity can indicate changes in the abundance
and diversity of a wide variety of invertebrates (Scoble
1992). Presence of a butterfly or moth species indicates
presence of the larval host plant, as well as sufficient adult
food resources. Day-flying butterflies in particular have a
well-known taxonomy, and often can be easily identified in
the field (Scoble 1992).
In the ponderosa pine ecosystem, the diurnal Lepidopteran
(butterflies) can be used to monitor important changes in
ecosystem function as a result of disturbance, rehabilitation,
or restoration events. Restoration of ponderosa pine forests

Butterfly Response and Successional Change Following Ecosystem Restoration
Waltz and Covington
involves thinning to create openings, thereby initiating an
herbaceous successional pattern (Springer and others, this
proceedings). While butterflies have shown decreases in
abundance after clear-cut logging events (Hill and others
1995), openings in forests or changes created by roadways
and paths often show higher butterfly abundances than
nearby forests (Pollard and others 1975). It has also been
shown that the butterfly community structure changes in
response to successional changes from grasslands to forests
in Europe (Erhardt and Thomas 1991). These studies sug-
gest the potential for both an immediate and a long-term
response to ponderosa pine restoration. For example, but-
terfly diversity and abundances could initially decrease in
response to logging and ecosystem disturbance, then in-
crease in abundance and diversity with the increasing
herbaceous community.
The study presented here was initiated to establish the
response of butterflies to ecological restoration treatments
and potential mechanisms of that response. If changes in
butterfly communities are noted, future studies will exam-
ine the role of butterflies as bioindicators of invertebrate
pollinator groups.
Research Questions
To address the usefulness of butterflies as indicators of
restoration treatments, this paper specifically addresses the
questions:
1. Does the butterfly community differ between ponde-
rosa pine restoration treatment units and untreated forest?
2. What are potential mechanisms of these differences:
(a) Are nectar resources distributed differently? (b) Are host
plants distributed differently? (c) Does butterfly habitat
preference explain butterfly distribution?
3. Finally, do butterflies show a successional response to
restoration treatments?
Methods _______________________
Study Site
The study site used for this research is a ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa) and Gambel oak (Querqus gambelii)
forest located between Mt. Logan and Mt. Trumbull, about
35 km north of the Grand Canyon on the Arizona Strip. This
land is currently managed by the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment, and falls within the newly designated Grand Canyon-
Parashant National Monument. Mt. Logan, Mt. Trumbull
and the surrounding highlands form a sky island of ponde-
rosa pine, with desert grassland to the north and the Grand
Canyon to the south. The nearest ponderosa pine forest is
about 100 km east, on the Kaibab Plateau. The elevation of
the sky island ranges from 1,675 m to 2,620 m. The area
receives an average of 40–45 cm of rainfall annually, and
contains some of the biota of the Great Basin (Utah Flora
1986), in addition to the flora of northern Arizona (Kearney
and Peebles 1951). The forest is predominately ponderosa
pine, although Gambel oak composes 15 percent of the
overstory. Other tree species in the area include aspen
(Populus tremuloides), pinyon (Pinus edulis), juniper
(Juniperus osteospermus), and New Mexican locust (Robinia
neomexicanus). Although New Mexican locust is classified
as a shrub, it grows to tree stature at this site, and is sampled
as a tree. The understory component is dominated by sage-
brush (Artemesia tridentata), and shows evidence of inva-
sion by nonnative species, such as cheatgrass (Bromus
tectorum) and wheatgrasses (Agropyron spp.). Although 150
herbaceous species have been documented at Mt. Trumbull
since the late 1990s (J.D. Springer, personal communica-
tion), the forest floor cover prior to restoration treatments
was 70 percent litter and duff, with only 15 percent of the
cover represented by understory species.
Approximately 1,450 ha of the 5,000-ha forest is targeted
for restoration treatment (Covington and others l995), and
as of 1999, approximately 200 ha had been thinned and
burned. This restoration project is jointly sponsored by the
BLM, the Arizona Game and Fish Department, and North-
ern Arizona University Ecological Restoration Institute.
The ponderosa pine ecosystem restoration project takes an
adaptive management approach, so that results from initial
treatments can be incorporated into later treatments. The
actual treatments in place are therefore continuing to evolve.
At this site, analysis of fire scars provided a fire exclusion
date (in other words, the date of the last widespread fire) of
1870. All treatment sites incorporate thinning trees to
densities resembling those at the time of fire exclusion.
Trees established at the time of fire exclusion are retained,
as well as younger “replacement” trees for presettlement era
trees that have died since fire exclusion. Fire is used prelimi-
nary to help reduce slash, and then will be returned to the
landscape every 4–7 years, depending on weather condi-
tions. For complete details of the treatment, please see the
1996 Annual Report to BLM. Treatment of all 1,450 ha is to
be completed by 2002.
Butterfly Sampling
Butterfly monitoring data presented in this paper were
taken from two units treated in 1996 (Lava Unit) and in 1998
(Trick Tank Unit). Butterfly monitoring transects (Pollard
1977) were established in the two treatment units, and were
paired with monitoring transects in untreated forests (con-
trol) adjacent to each unit. Transects were placed 50 m from
unit boundaries to minimize edge effects and were at least
50 m apart. Although length of transects varied with total
treatment unit size to maintain buffer from edges, lengths of
the paired treatment-control transects were the same.
Transects in the Lava unit totaled 450 m in each the
treatment and the control; transects in the Trick Tank unit
totaled 600 m in each the treatment and the control for a
total of 2,100 m per survey.
Transects were monitored every week, between May and
September of 1999. Diurnal butterflies are very sensitive to
cool and windy conditions, often limiting their flights on
cloudy, cool days, thereby reducing chance of observation.
Therefore, sampling was done between 1,000 and 1,600
hours, on days warmer than 17 ∞C, with winds less than
10 mph, and mostly sunny skies (Pollard 1977). A total of
5 minutes per 100 m was spent looking for butterflies.
Butterfly species encountered on each transect were recorded,
along with location along transect, and lateral distance from

transect (perpendicular to transect). In addition for each
observation, we recorded behavior (in other words, nectaring,
basking, flying), and if collected. If the butterfly could not be
identified in flight, attempts were made to capture and
collect the insect. The timed portion of the survey corre-
sponded only to the observations and did not include time
spent in pursuit of a butterfly.
Nectar Resources and Host Plant
Distribution and Habitat Preferences
To quantify nectar resources and host plant distribution,
vegetation along the butterfly monitoring transects were
monitored in 1-m2 plots every 20 m along the established
transect. A total of 30 plots were sampled in both the Trick
Tank treatment and the nearby control, and 23 plots were
sampled in both the Lava treatment and its adjacent control.
Plots were monitored three times during the summer: May,
June and August. At each plot, flowering and nonflowering
plants were tallied by species. In addition, total number of
flowers per 1-m2 plots was tallied. These data were summa-
rized by unit and treatment to determine differences in
flowering plant species richness and host plant abundance.
Habitat preferences for each butterfly were determined
from the literature, predominately Scott (1984). All butter-
fly observations from both units and the entire season were
then grouped into habitat preference classes. Total tallies
are presented here. No statistical analysis was done because
data were lumped, resulting in no replication.
Successional Response to Restoration
To address whether butterflies show a successional
response to restoration, we compared the butterfly commu-
nities from Lava and Trick Tank units, using the same
monitoring data from above. The Lava unit was treated in
1996, and is referred to as a 3-year posttreatment unit. The
Trick Tank unit, treated in 1998, is referred to as a 1-year
posttreatment unit. Butterfly species richness, abundance,
and composition were compared.
Results ________________________
Thirty-three butterfly species were collected at the Mt.
Trumbull site in 1999 (table 1). The most common of these
included the silver-spotted skipper (Epargyreus clarus,
EPCL), the Gambel oak dusky-wing (Erynnis telemachus,
ERTE), the silvery blue (Glaucopsyche lygdamus, GLLY),
the orange sulfur (Colias eurytheme, COEU), and the check-
ered white (Pieris protodice, PIPR). The butterflies used a
range of hostplants, including legumes, mustards, various
shrubs, shrub-trees (New Mexican locust) and trees (oak).
Butterfly Community Response
to Restoration Treatments
We found up to three times as many butterfly species in
restoration treatments as in the adjacent, untreated con-
trol forests (fig. 1, Repeated Measures ANOVA, F = 12.9,
p < 0.10). Table 2 lists species found in the Lava and Trick

Tank treatment and control units. Common species were
observed in both control and restoration treatment units but
were seen more often in restoration treatments. Rare species
(such as Heliopetes ericetorum) were observed in restoration
treatments, when seen.
Butterfly abundance was also significantly greater in
restoration treatment areas as in adjacent control forests
(Repeated Measures ANOVA, F = 7.98, p = 0.106). Four to
eight times as many butterflies were observed in treatment
units as in adjacent controls on any given survey date. As
shown in table 2, silver-spotted skipper (Epargyreus clarus)
was the most common species observed, and was observed
five times as frequently in the treatment unit as in the
control units. Pieris species (whites) where highly abundant
in the area, but were observed only once in the control units.
Only one butterfly showed higher abundances in the control
units than in the treatment units. The Arizona sister
(Limenitis bredowii) was rare in 1999 but was observed 10
times in control units and only four times in treatment units.
This pattern for the Arizona sister is consistent with 1998
data (Waltz and Covington 1999).
Nectar Resource Richness
and Abundance
We examined potential mechanisms for increased butter-
fly species richness and abundance in treated forests. From
the 1-m2 plots surveyed along butterfly transects, we com-
pared the species richness, species abundance, and flower
abundance of the plants that were flowering at the time of
survey. Number of flowering species (species richness) was
significantly greater in treatment vegetation plots than in

control vegetation plots (fig. 2, Kruskal-Wallis test (effects =
survey and trt), treatment Z = 5.45, p < 0.05). In addition,
flowering plant abundance (or number of plants) was also
significantly greater (fig. 3, Kruskal-Wallis, treatment Z =
5.50, p < 0.05). Not surprisingly, abundance of flowers per
1-m2 plot was also significantly greater in treated units, with
up to 200 times as many flowers in 1-m2 plots (Kruskal-
Wallis, Z = 5.77, p < 0.05). These results showed that both a
higher diversity of plants and a higher total number of
plants were flowering in restoration treatment units.
Host Plant Distributions and Habitat

We examined host plant distributions for the five most
common butterfly species (table 1, * species denote most
common). Table 3 lists these butterflies, their associated

represent proportion of observed butterflies only, lumped
from 10 surveys from both sites. No statistical analysis

Alternative methods are planned to adequately assess host
plant distributions in treatment and control units.
Data on habitat preference and host plant preference are
reported only as observed trends, and will be used to gener-
ate hypotheses to be tested in future field seasons. The
highest proportion of the butterflies observed in control
units were species preferring wooded habitat (fig. 4a). The
highest proportion of the butterflies observed in treatment
units were species preferring woods/open habitat (fig. 4b).
Host plant preferences also displayed interesting trends.
Butterfly species that hosted on tree species made up the
highest proportion of the butterflies observed in the control
areas. Alternatively, butterfly species hosting on legumes
and forbs made up the highest proportion of the butterflies
observed in the treatment areas. Basically, the butterfly
species observed in control areas were species that preferred
wooded habitat, and most often were species that hosted on
tree species. Butterflies observed in treated areas were
species that preferred more open habitat, and most often
were species that hosted on legumes or forbs. Because of lack
of sample size, the variables habitat preference and host
plant type were not statistically tested. These results repre-
sent proportional trends only.
Butterfly Community Successional
Response to Restoration
Figure 5 displays the butterfly species richness data
across surveys between the Lava unit (3-years posttreat-
ment) and the Trick Tank unit (1-year posttreatment).
Because we observed only one unit for each successional
stage, these data are presented as trends. Although some
trend exists toward higher numbers of species in the 3-year
posttreatment unit, we cannot assess those differences with
only one sampling unit per successional stage. Plant commu-
nities shift from an annual forb community in 1-year post-
treatment units to more perennial forbs and grasses in the
3-year posttreatment unit (Springer, personal communica-
tion). We did see increases in diversity of flowering species

in the 3-year posttreatment unit compared with the 1-year
posttreatment unit. Future studies will be designed to in-
crease sample size and address the successional response of
butterflies to ecological restoration.
Discussion _____________________
We have shown that the butterfly community had higher
species richness and abundance in restoration treatments
when compared with adjacent control forests. We also sug-
gest that species with low abundance are more often found
in treated units than in control units. Ponderosa pine resto-
ration treatments alter habitat by opening up tree canopies
and increasing herbaceous production. The fast responses of
butterflies to these changes (within one season after treat-
ment) suggest that arthropods may be one of the first
responders to ecological changes. Erhardt and Thomas (1991)
also documented butterfly responses to plant successional
changes, showing butterfly community changes even before
plant community changes could be detected. While some
studies show that butterflies decrease after logging events
(Hill and others 1995), the logging monitored in those cases
was clear-cutting, with little regard for understory estab-
lishment. Our results agree with several studies that show
gaps created in forest canopies increase butterfly abun-
dances, whether through increased host plant diversity, or
changes in microhabitats (abiotic variables) (Pollard 1977;
Pollard and others 1975; Holl 1996).
The mechanistic hypotheses we examined to explain but-
terfly distributions suggest nectar resource availability may
contribute greatly to adult butterfly distribution patterns.
Our preliminary results showed large differences in avail-
able nectar resources in Lava and Trick Tank treatment
units, when compared with adjacent control forests. In-
creased nectar resources can be associated with disturbed
areas; many early successional plants are flowering forbs
(Springer 1998). Studies have shown that nectar resources
are important to adult oviposition selections. Host plants
are utilized only when sufficient adult resources (nectar) are
also available (Grossmueller and Lederhouse 1987; Murphy
1983). Successful butterfly habitat must therefore include
sufficient larval and adult food resources.
Our restoration treatments have much higher plant diver-
sity than control forests (Springer and others, this proceed-
ings), implicating a higher diversity of butterfly host plants
in these areas. Our results showed no differences in the host
plant distributions of five common butterflies between treat-
ment and control forests. However, the sampling method
used here was not designed for tree species, which act as host
plants for two of the most common butterflies. In addition,
the variability of plant abundance measured in these units
was also very high, suggesting plant distributions should be
measured on a greater than 1-m2 scale. Both reasons suggest
our current sampling method is not adequate to address
questions of host plant distributions.
Habitat preference may also contribute to butterfly com-
munity composition shifts. A habitat change from closed-
canopy, low plant diversity forests to open canopy grasslands
may also see a corresponding shift in butterfly community
composition. Our preliminary observations suggest that
butterflies found in treated forests were more likely to be
species preferring open habitat, requiring legume and forb
host plants. Conversely, butterflies observed in control for-
ests were more likely to be species preferring wooded habi-
tat, and hosting on tree species. Although we could not test
these patterns statistically, other papers have shown the
importance of habitat selection in community composition
(Ehrlich and Raven 1964; Ehrlich 1993; Erhardt and Thomas
1991).
Studies of the successional response of butterflies to resto-
ration may give insight to how fine of a scale butterflies can
respond to. The successional change in plant communities
following thinning and burning can be dramatic. In the
Lava unit, plant species richness increased from less than
5 species in 1995 to 7, 16,  and 20 species in posttreatment
years 1, 2, and 3 respectively. However, it may take longer
for these plant species to establish viable, reproducing
populations. Steffan-Dewenter and Tscharntke (1997) ob-
served successional responses of butterfly communities in
set-aside fields in Germany. Although species richness of the
butterfly communities did not change through 4 years of
agricultural field succession, the butterfly community com-
position did show differences. If butterfly communities can
show responses at these yearly scales, they may be very
useful indicators of successional stage following a distur-
bance or a restoration treatment.

These results are from a small sample size (two units with
paired controls) and should be treated as preliminary, but at
the same time suggest more rigorous studies are validated.
Currently, a paired block design is set up to monitor butter-
fly response to restoration treatments and mechanisms of
these responses. This increased sample size should help
reduce this problem in future studies.
To successfully examine butterfly population responses to
restoration treatments, reproductive success and host plant
usage should also be documented. Our current design moni-
tors only adult butterfly populations. However, studies have
shown positive correlations between adult butterfly densi-
ties and larval densities, suggesting monitoring of adult
butterflies may provide a close indication of larval densities
(Steffan-Dewenter and Tscharntke 1997). Of the 20 species
recorded in the Lava and Trick Tank units and associated
controls, 12 were classified as locally distributed, not rang-
ing far from their host plants as adults (Scott 1984).
Implications
The response of butterfly communities suggests other
arthropod herbivores may respond to restoration treat-
ments in similar ways. Arthropods constitute the largest
biomass of any taxon and occupy a large range of functional
niches (Kremen and others 1993). Bees and other nectar or
pollen feeding arthropods may show increases in diversity
and abundance as a response to increased nectar resources,
and therefore may parallel the responses of the butterfly
community. The importance of pollinators to ecosystem
function has recently become the focus of many questions,
due to the decreasing abundance of native bees (Buchmann
and Nabhan 1996; Kevan 1999). Although butterflies are not

Butterfly Response and Successional Change Following Ecosystem Restoration
as efficient at pollination as the Hymenoptera (bees and
wasps) or Diptera (flies) (Scoble 1992), they are easier to
monitor and identify. In addition, arthropods decompose
organic material, release nutrients back into the ecosystem,
and provide the largest food source in almost every ecosys-
tem (Wilson 1987).
Using these restoration experiments, the efficacy of but-
terflies as biodiversity indicators of these other arthropods
can easily be tested, by increased sampling of other taxo-
nomic groups, correlations, and finally testing in other areas
undergoing restoration treatments.
The research presented here provides insight into how the
butterfly community responds to habitat change, and some
of the mechanisms behind that response. Not only do butter-
fly communities contribute to ecosystem functioning through
herbivory, providing food source and pollination events,
they also have the potential to be bioindicators of biodiver-
sity in other arthropod guilds.
