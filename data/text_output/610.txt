Abstract Abiotic controls on net nitrification rates
are well documented, but the potential effects of
plants on this important ecosystem process are poorly
understood. We evaluated four structural equation
models to determine the relative importance of plant
community composition, aboveground herbaceous
production, and plant species richness on nitrifier
abundance and net nitrification following restoration
treatments in a ponderosa pine forest. Model selection
criteria indicated that species richness was the best
predictor of nitrifier abundance, but a model that
included community composition effects also had
some support in the data. Model results suggest that
net nitrification was indirectly related to plant species
richness via a positive relationship between species
richness and nitrifier abundance. Community compo-
sition was indirectly related to nitrifier abundance
through its relationship with species richness. Our
model indicates that species-rich plant communities
dominated by C3 graminoids and legumes are
associated with soils that have high abundances of
nitrifiers. This study highlights the complexity of
deciphering effects of ecological treatments on a
system response when multiple interacting factors
are simultaneously affected. Our results suggest that
plant diversity and composition can both respond to
forest thinning, prescribed fire and fuel manipula-
tions, and can be factors that might indirectly
influence an ecosystem process such as nitrification.
Ecological restoration treatments designed to increase
plant diversity and alter community composition may
have cascading effects on below-ground processes.

the internal cycling of nitrogen (N), is a critical
function for terrestrial ecosystems because it accounts
for about 88% of the global N demand of plants
(Schlesinger 1997). This process includes the miner-
alization of organic N to ammonium, the oxidation of
mineralized ammonium to nitrite and nitrate (nitrifi-
cation), the microbial assimilation of these mineral
forms of N by microorganisms, and plant uptake
(Hart et al. 1994). The major abiotic controls on
nitrification are well documented (Robertson and
Groffman 2007), but less is known about biotic
factors such as the above-ground plant community
that may also influence this important ecosystem
process. In this study, we evaluate the relative
significance of community composition, herbaceous
production, and plant species richness to net nitrifi-
cation in an applied context of forest restoration,
where changes in ecosystem functioning are of great
concern (Kaye and Hart 1998).
Southwestern ponderosa pine forests have become
increasingly dense over the last century due to fire
suppression, logging, grazing, and favorable climatic
events for pine regeneration (Covington et al. 1997).
These changes in forest structure have led to a decline
in understory production and diversity (Moore et al.
2006; Laughlin et al. 2008) and have reduced
nitrogen transformation rates in the soil (Kaye and
Hart 1998). In 1992, a long-term restoration experi-
ment was initiated to understand the effects of tree
thinning and prescribed burning on forest structure
and ecosystem function (Covington et al. 1997).
Nitrogen transformation rates responded positively
to the treatments and was thought to be in response to
increased herbaceous plant production in the under-
story (Kaye and Hart 1998; Moore et al. 2006). The
patchy distribution of trees combined with the
thinning and burning treatments created variation in
plant diversity, community composition, and herba-
ceous productivity across the study site, thereby
providing an opportunity to compare the influences
of these three properties of the plant community on
the key ecosystem process of nitrification.
Any effect of plants on nitrification rates must be
mediated by their effects on nitrifying microorganisms
(Wardle 2002). Nitrifiers in this system are likely
mostly chemolithotrophs, given the circum-neutral pH
of the soil, which obtain carbon from carbon dioxide
and obtain energy from oxidizing ammonium and
nitrite (Robertson and Groffman 2007). Any effect of
plant diversity or composition on nitrifiers is likely
mediated through ammonium availability (Kaye and
Hart 1997). Ammonium availability could be influ-
enced by three attributes of the plant community:
composition, productivity, or diversity. First, the
composition of the plant community could influence
ammonium availability because a community domi-
nated by plants with high nitrogen concentrations
would likely have positive effects on mineralization
rates (Grime 1998). Previous work has shown that the
quality of plant material can determine the structure of
microbial communities (Bardgett et al. 1999; Griffiths
et al. 1999; Hart et al. 2005) and chemical compounds
present in certain plants can inhibit nitrifier activity
(Lodhi and Killingbeck 1980). Second, productivity
could also influence ammonium availability because
greater inputs of herbaceous plant material could
increase mineralization rates and because soil micro-
organisms have been shown to respond to increased
carbon and nitrogen resources exuded in the rhizo-
sphere (Denton et al. 1999; Mikola et al. 2000). Third,
ammonium availability could also be affected by plant
diversity because a more diverse array of plant
compounds entering the soil through leaf litterfall,
root turnover, and root exudates could affect miner-
alization rates by providing a consistent long-term
supply of organic nitrogen as the different qualities of
plant material break down at different rates over time.
Plant diversity has been shown to be positively related
to N mineralization (Zak et al. 2003; West et al.
2006), microbial biomass (Spehn et al. 2000; Stephan
et al. 2000; Zak et al. 2003), and N retention (Tilman
et al. 1996). However, idiosyncratic or negative
responses of ecosystem processes to plant diversity
have also been detected (Wardle et al. 1999; Niklaus
et al. 2001; Schmid et al. 2002; Carney et al. 2004).
Clearly, determining the relative importance of plant
identity, productivity, and diversity to N cycling
should be an active area of research.
We developed four competing structural equation
models (SEM) that represent hypotheses about above-
and below-ground interactions (Fig. 1) in a recently
restored ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws. var.
scopulorum Englem.) forest in northern Arizona
(Kaye and Hart 1998). The “identity effects” model
states that only the composition of the plant commu-
nity directly influences nitrifiers and nitrification. The
“production effects” model states that only production
directly influences nitrifiers and net nitrification. The
436

“diversity effects” model asserts that only richness
directly influences nitrifiers and net nitrification. The
“full effects” model allows for all three factors to
influence nitrifiers and net nitrification. In all models,
herbaceous production and richness were allowed to
influence each other simultaneously (Gross and
Cardinale 2007), and herbaceous biomass and species
richness were modeled as functions of community
composition (Fig. 1). Pathways from abiotic factors
are not shown in Fig. 1 because they do not change
across models. Through these analyses, we show that
the data support a model where plant diversity and
community composition may indirectly influence net
nitrification through a positive relationship with
nitrifier abundance, suggesting that restoration treat-
ments designed to increase plant diversity may have
cascading effects on below-ground processes.
Materials and methods
Study system
This study was conducted in a ponderosa pine forest
at the Gus Pearson Natural Area (GPNA), located
10 km northwest of Flagstaff, Arizona, USA, in the
Fort Valley Experimental Forest. In 1992, 55
permanent plots were established within the full
spectrum of overstory canopy cover ranging from
completely open to closed (Covington et al. 1997;
Kaye and Hart 1998). These plots were nested within
treatment plots (0.2–0.3 ha) that were either thinned,
thinned and burned, or were left as controls; thus, 20
of the 55 plots were burned (Moore et al. 2006).
Consequently, fire and ponderosa pine density are
orthogonal factors in this study. Prior to burning in
October 1994, the Oa (humus) and Oe (fragmented)
layers were removed from the thinning and burning
treatment plots, and approximately 67 g m−2 of native
grasses and forbs were added to the Oi layer (last 2–
4 years of pine litterfall). This native “hay” was added
to emulate pre-EuroAmerican settlement fuel condi-
tions, which supported frequent, low-severity surface
fires (Covington et al. 1997). At this time of the study
(1995), the thin and burn treatment had been treated
only once in 1994. Prescribed fire is treated as a
binary experimental factor and in lieu of modeling
“thinning” effects as a binary factor, we used pine
basal area to understand the effects of overstory
density on other system components.
We sampled the herbaceous vegetation in September
of 1995 (Moore et al. 2006). The data was collected
2 years after the initial thinning treatment but only
1 year after the first prescribed burn. Annual precipi-
tation was near average in 1995. We determined plant
species richness within 2 m2 quadrats and harvested the
peak above-ground herbaceous standing crop. Prior to
weighing, plant biomass was separated into four
functional types: legumes, non-leguminous forbs, C3
graminoids, and C4 graminoids (Moore et al. 2006).

approximation of above-ground herbaceous net primary
production (ANPP) in this ecosystem because the study
area was fenced to exclude large grazers (i.e., domestic
livestock, deer, and elk; Bonham 1989).
Overstory density was estimated using ponderosa
pine basal area (m2 ha−1) on all trees within a 10 m
diameter plot centered on the herbaceous quadrats.
Continuous variation in pine basal area was used to
estimate effects of the pine overstory on understory
herbaceous vegetation and net nitrification. We also
collected, dried, and weighed the surface organic
horizon (O horizon) from within sampling frames at
each plot; dry weights were corrected for mineral
content via loss-on-ignition.
Soil organic matter was determined by mass loss-on-
ignition (550°C for 6 h), and total carbon (C) was
estimated using the ratio of 1.724 g organic matter/g C
(Nelson and Sommers 1982). Soil total N (organic +
ammonium) was determined by modified micro-
Kjeldahl digestion (Parkinson and Allen 1975) and
flow injection analysis using the salicylate method
(Lachat Instruments 1992).
We measured seasonal rates of net nitrification in
situ in each of the 55 plots using modified resin-core
incubations (Binkley and Hart 1989) described in
detail and reported in Kaye and Hart (1998). Net
nitrification was calculated as the difference in soil
(0–15 cm mineral soil and O horizon) nitrate pool size
between incubated and initial soil plus nitrate
adsorbed on the underlying resin bag. These measure-
ments were carried out from May 1995 through April
1996 using 2∼6 month incubation periods (i.e., winter
and summer). Shorter incubation times (1 month to
2 months) using the cover-core incubation method
(Hart et al. 1994) provide seasonal net rate estimates
similar to those using resin-cores and longer incuba-
tion periods in these ecosystems (Hart et al. 2006).
Though some nitrification has been shown to be
caused by soil fungi (Laughlin et al. 2008), we
assume that most nitrification in the soils we studied
is autotrophic given the circum-neutral pH of the soils
(Hart et al. 1994).
We estimated nitrifier abundance using the soil
slurry method (Belser 1979; Hart et al. 1994) on soils
sampled from the upper 15 cm of the mineral soil in
August 1995, when we expected nitrifier activity to
be at a maximum because of warm and moist soil
conditions during this period (Kaye and Hart 1998;
Hart et al. 2005). Briefly, soils were added to a neutral
pH, phosphate- and ammonium-rich solution. Soil
slurries were shaken on an orbital mixer, and samples
were drawn at 2 h, 4 h, 22 h and 24 h, and analyzed
for nitrate on an autoanalyzer. The slope of the best
fitting line between the four sampling periods yields
an estimate of nitrate production per unit time. We
relate this index of nitrifier population size to net rates
of nitrification under the assumption that relative
abundance of nitrifiers will be similar among different
canopy types throughout the growing season; this
assumption has previous empirical support (Davidson
et al. 1990).
Data analysis
We quantified the composition of the plant community
using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS;
McCune and Grace 2002). We used the standing crop
of four functional types (legumes, non-leguminous
forbs, C3 graminoids, and C4 graminoids) as response
variables. We used the Bray-Curtis distance measure
with random starting configurations, 50 runs with real
data, a maximum of 250 iterations per run, and a
stability criterion of 0.00001. A Monte Carlo test with
50 randomizations was used to determine how likely
the observed stress value of the final solution would be
by chance alone. The final stress for the three-
dimensional solution was 7.4 (P=0.0196). We rotated
the final configuration to maximize the covariance
between the first ordination axis and nitrifier abun-
dance in order to maximize the possibility that
composition is related to nitrification. The scores for
each plot along the first NMS axis were used in the
structural equation model analysis to represent com-
munity composition. The first NMS axis was positively
correlated with the abundance of C3 graminoids and
legumes.
We compared four SEMs to determine the relative
importance of community composition, species rich-
ness, and herbaceous production effects on nitrifier
abundance and net nitrification after accounting for
important abiotic factors. The four models in Fig. 1
highlight the mechanistic differences between the
models without illustrating the remaining pathways
from abiotic factors, which are constant across the
four models.
All four models included the hypotheses that net
nitrification is a function of: 1) nitrifier abundance; 2)
the relative availability of C and N in the soil,
438
Plant Soil (2010) 330:435–445

measured by the soil C:N mass ratio (Robertson and
Groffman 2007); 3) O horizon mass; and 4) ponderosa
pine basal area. The O horizon and pine basal area
negatively influence soil temperature and soil mois-
ture, respectively, primarily through shading and
evapotranspiration (Hart et al. 2005). However, we
could not include soil moisture and temperature
directly in the model since these data were only
measured on 22 out of 55 plots. The mean maximum
soil temperature in 1995 was negatively correlated
with O horizon mass (n=21, r=−0.55, P=0.0091),
and mineral soil moisture during the summer mon-
soon season was negatively correlated with pine basal
area (n=55, r=−0.37, P=0.0053).
We used observed variable SEM, which includes
only variables that have been directly measured
(Grace 2006). We used maximum likelihood to
estimate model parameters using Mplus software
(Muthén and Muthén 2005). Structural equation
modeling allowed us to quantify simultaneous feed-
backs among model components. Recent analyses
suggest that plant diversity and productivity may
influence each other simultaneously (Gross and
Cardinale 2007). Therefore, evaluations of statistical
models that allow for reciprocal relationships are
essential for clarifying our understanding of natural
systems (e.g., Grace et al. 2007), especially when
assessing the relative importance of diversity and
productivity to N cycling rates. Nonrecursive models
involve direct feedback where two variables are in a
reciprocal relationship within one sampling period.
This method requires that the model is sufficiently
identified to obtain a unique solution, and that the
processes being sampled are occurring simultaneously
(Grace 2006). Following the reasoning outlined by
Grace et al. (2007), we used this technique to evaluate
the relationships between herbaceous production and
herbaceous species richness (Fig. 1).
We used the second-order bias corrected Akaike
Information Criterion (AICc) to evaluate the support
for the four models (Burnham and Anderson 2002).
The AICc value for each model was rescaled to Δi by
subtracting the smallest AICc in the model set from
the other AICc values. The resulting Δi values were
then converted to Akaike weights (wi), which sum to
1 and can be interpreted as the weight of evidence in
favor of model i.
Because any model selection criterion can poten-
tially select poor models if no good model is in the
candidate set, we also employed the chi-square
goodness of fit measure to ensure that there were no
model-data discrepancies in the model with most
support. Models that fit the data have small chi-square
values and large P-values, suggesting that the covari-
ance structure of the model is consistent with the
covariance structure of the data. In the final selected
model, a composite variable was used to model
quadratic relationships (Grace 2006). Squared terms
are not illustrated in the model figures for simplicity
in data presentation, but quadratic relationships are
indicated by (±). We used logarithmic (base e)
transformations of pine basal area, O horizon mass,
and net nitrification to eliminate heteroscedasticity
within bivariate relationships.
We further evaluated the relationship between plant
communities and nitrification using multiple regres-
sion analysis. The first model regressed nitrifier
abundance on soil C:N ratio, plant species richness,
and the non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS)
ordination axis. The second model regressed nitrifier
abundance on soil C:N ratio, plant species richness,
and peak standing crop of four functional groups
(legumes, non-leguminous forbs, C3 graminoids, and
C4 graminoids).
Results
Bivariate scatterplots illustrate relationships between
above-ground plant community attributes and below-
ground soil attributes. First, nitrifier abundance was
positively related to community composition, herba-
ceous production, and species richness, and negatively
related to the soil C:N ratio (Fig. 2a–d). Second, net
nitrification rates were negatively related to the soil C:
N ratio and pine basal area, positively related to
herbaceous production and species richness, and non-
linearly related to nitrifier abundance (Fig. 2e–i). Third,
herbaceous production was a positive function of plant
species richness and a negative function of pine basal
area (Fig. 3a–b). Fourth, species richness was a
nonlinear function of herbaceous production, and was
positively correlated with the NMS ordination axis
(Fig. 3c–d). Given that ecological theories predict that
richness is a nonlinear function of production and that
production may be a positive function of richness, the
reciprocal relationships between them must be simul-
taneously evaluated using a nonrecursive SEM.

No model received overwhelming support in the
data. Model selection criterion (AICc) suggested
that the “diversity effects” model was the most
likely of the four models, given these data (Table 1).
The “diversity effects” model was 2.8 times more
likely than the “identity effects” model and was 7.8
times more likely than the “production effects”
model (Table 1). The “production effects” and “full
effects” models received little support in the data.
Given that the diversity effects model received the
most support, we show parameter estimates for this
model in Fig. 4. The diversity effects model yielded
no significant model-data discrepancies (χ2=36.4,
27 df, P=0.11).
The selection of the diversity effects model implies
that net nitrification was indirectly linked to herba-
ceous plant species richness through the mediating
effects of nitrifier abundance, and community com-
position was indirectly linked to nitrifier abundance
through its relationship with species richness (Fig. 4).
After accounting for covariates, species richness and
herbaceous production were uncorrelated (Fig. 4).
Multiple regression analyses were used to further
explore whether richness or composition was more

(a–d) and net nitrification (e–i) and the factors proposed to
influence each in a ponderosa pine forest. Nitrifier abundance
was estimated using the method of Belser (1979) and Hart et
al. (1994). Soil C:N ratio = mineral soil carbon to nitrogen
mass ratio

strongly related to nitrifier abundance. These analyses
lend additional support to the hypothesis that species
richness is an important predictor of nitrifier abundance
in the presence of either the NMS ordination axis or the
peak biomass of the major plant functional types
(Table 2). In the first multiple regression model
(Table 2), the soil C:N ratio (P=0.015) was the most
important predictor of nitrifier abundance, species
richness was a marginally important predictor (P=
0.059), and the NMS ordination axis was not an
important predictor (P=0.74). In the second multiple
regression model (Table 2), the soil C:N ratio was the
most important predictor of nitrifier abundance (P=
0.015), species richness was also a significant predictor
(P=0.039), but none of the four plant functional types
were significant predictors (each P>0.25).
Discussion
Our model suggests that plant diversity and commu-
nity composition can simultaneously be both a
response to restoration treatments and a factor that
may influence a below-ground ecosystem process.
Overstory removal through thinning small-diameter
trees stimulates herbaceous production and influences
community composition, and forest floor reduction
through the reintroduction of surface fires increases
species richness. Ecological restoration treatments
that alter the composition of the plant community
may therefore have cascading effects on nitrifier
abundance and rates of nitrification.
Net nitrification was controlled by both abiotic and
biotic factors, and was indirectly linked to herbaceous
plant species richness (Fig. 4) through the mediating
effects of nitrifier abundance. Net nitrification was
unexpectedly highest at intermediate abundances of
nitrifiers (Fig. 2). We speculate that at high nitrifier
abundances a decline in net nitrification occurs because
of greater amounts of microbial immobilization of
nitrate relative to ammonium as available N pools
become dominated by nitrate (Stark and Hart 1997).
Biotic effects on net nitrification were nearly equally
as important as abiotic effects. Net nitrification was

highest where soil C:N ratios were lowest (Fig. 2),
which is consistent with the paradigm of increased
availability of ammonium to nitrifiers as microbial
immobilization of ammonium declines (Hart et al.
1994). High pine basal area directly reduced net
nitrification rates independent of effects through
herbaceous production and species richness. This may
be due to allelopathic inhibition of nitrification (Lodhi
and Killingbeck 1980), and can also be explained by
the negative effects of evapotranspiration on soil water
content as pine basal area increases (see “Materials and
methods”), which strongly influences microbial activity
(Robertson and Groffman 2007). After accounting for
pine basal area, O horizon mass was positively related
to net nitrification rates, which was surprising given
that O horizon mass reduced soil temperatures (see
“Materials and methods”). We speculate that the O
horizon moderated temporal fluctuations in the mineral
soil microclimate (Perry et al. 2008), thereby increas-
ing mean microbial process rates. However, prescribed
fire effects on nitrification were complex and offset-
ting. The fire and fuel manipulation reduced the mass
of the O horizon. However, the O horizon was also
negatively related to species richness, suggesting that
the negative fire effect on nitrification mediated
through the O horizon was offset by the positive fire
effect mediated through an increase in species richness.
These results suggest that fire and thinning treatments
may offset each other with respect to their effects on
net nitrification (Kaye and Hart 1998).
Nitrifier abundance was positively associated with
herbaceous plant species richness (Fig. 2), even after
accounting for the negative effect of C:N ratios on
nitrifier abundance (Fig. 4). It has been suggested that
microbial biomass can be stimulated by diverse
organic substrates (Bardgett and Shine 1999), but this
is likely only true for heterotrophic microbes that
obtain C from organic matter. In contrast, chemo-
lithotrophic nitrifiers obtain energy from oxidizing
ammonium and nitrite (Robertson and Groffman
2007). We suggest that the mechanistic link between

value for each model was rescaled to Δi by subtracting the
smallest AICc in the model set from the other AICc values.
The resulting Δi values were then converted to Akaike
weights (wi), which sum to 1, and can be interpreted as the
weight of evidence in favor of each model

plant diversity effects on nitrifiers is likely mediated
through ammonium availability (Kaye and Hart
1997). A diverse array of litter quality in a community
could affect mineralization rates by providing a more
consistent long-term supply of organic N as the
different qualities of plant material break down at
different rates over time. The model also implies that
the composition of the plant community can influence
nitrifier abundance through its relationship with
species richness. Apparently, richness has a stronger
relationship to nitrifier abundance than community
composition, but model results suggest that the
identity of the plant community does have an effect
on below-ground processes.
Herbaceous production was not the most important
predictor of nitrifier abundance or net nitrification,
which was surprising given that other studies have
concluded that plant productivity covaries with soil
microbial biomass (Wardle et al. 1999; Spehn et al.
2000). Indeed, increasing primary production
increases litter inputs and root exudation and turn-
over, which should stimulate microbial communities
(Wardle 2002). Perhaps the qualities of diverse
organic substrates are more important than the
quantity of detrital inputs or root exudates in this
system.
It was also surprising that the functional identity of
the plant community did not play a more significant role
in predicting nitrifier abundance or nitrification rates.
Bivariate relationships suggested that community com-
position was correlated with nitrifier abundance, but the
importance of composition as a predictor declined in the
presence of species richness. The NMS axis was
correlated with species richness such that the most
diverse communities were dominated by C3 graminoids
and legumes, suggesting that the functional identity of
the plant community could still be an important factor
that can influence ecosystem processes (Grime 1998).
Our model indicates that species-rich plant communi-
ties dominated by C3 graminoids and legumes are
associated with soils that have high abundances of
nitrifiers.
Despite a recent flurry of empirical and theoret-
ical work, there is no clear relationship between
diversity and ecosystem process rates in the litera-
ture. This may be due to a variety of reasons,
including differences in soil characteristics among
studies and inherent differences between synthesized
versus natural communities. Zak et al. (2003)
detected a positive plant diversity effect on gross N
mineralization at Cedar Creek, which have soils low
in organic matter (4 g C kg−1 to 5 g C kg−1), whereas
Wardle et al. (1999) detected no relationship between
plant diversity and decomposition rates in New
Zealand soils that were rich in organic matter
(130 g C kg−1). The soils in this ponderosa pine
forest contain about 40 g C kg−1 in the surface soil
(Kaye and Hart 1998), which is intermediate but
closer to those found at Cedar Creek. Perhaps the
relative availability of organic C in soils mediates the
relationship between plant diversity and soil microbial
processes, as suggested by Zak et al. (2003).
Furthermore, there is growing evidence that diversity
does not strongly influence primary productivity in

natural compared to experimentally synthesized eco-
systems (Grime 2001; Kahmen et al. 2005; Grace et
al. 2007). Finally, it cannot be expected that diversity
positively affects all ecosystem processes (Wardle
2002). It is likely that diversity effects are both
process- and context-specific.
Our analysis suggests that forest restoration
treatments that positively affect plant species rich-
ness and shift community composition may also
indirectly influence a specific functional group of
microorganisms (nitrifiers) that have strong effects
on ecosystem function. Moreover, herbaceous plant
species richness may be used as a predictor of
nitrifier abundance following restoration treatments
in southwestern USA ponderosa pine forests. This
analysis represents short-term effects of restoration
treatments, and future work should examine longer-
term and temporal responses of below-ground
processes to treatments while accounting for plant
community dynamics. Although diversity was not
seen to influence primary production, it may
indirectly influence other ecosystem processes, such
as internal N cycling, through positive effects on
nitrifiers. Such plant diversity effects on N cycling
may feed back to influence plant communities.
