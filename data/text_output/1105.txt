Abstract
Background: Fire regimes are shifting in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson)-dominated forests,
raising concern regarding future vegetation patterns and forest resilience, particularly within high-severity burn
patches. The southwestern US has recently experienced a marked increase in large fires that produce large, high-
severity patch interiors, with few surviving trees. These areas could be more susceptible for forest loss and
conversions to alternative vegetation types than areas closer to the forest edge with more available seed sources.
To better understand forest recovery, we surveyed ponderosa pine regeneration within edge and core areas
(>200 m from edge) of high-severity patches in ten fires that burned between 1996 to 2008 across Arizona
and New Mexico, USA. Specifically, we compared regeneration density, height, and canopy cover in patch
edge and core areas and used generalized linear models to investigate the abiotic and biotic factors that
contribute to ponderosa pine seedling establishment and density.
Results: High-severity burn-patch edge and core plots were not significantly different in seedling density,
height, or canopy cover across fires. Seedling establishment was more likely at higher-elevation mesic sites
and less likely when Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.) was more abundant. Seedling density was
negatively impacted by shrub, grass, and Gambel oak cover.
Conclusions: Regeneration density varied among fires but analysis of regeneration in aggregated edge and
core plots showed that abundance of seed availability was not the sole factor that limited ponderosa pine
regeneration, probably because of surviving tree refugia within high-severity burn patches. Furthermore, our
findings emphasize that ponderosa pine regeneration in our study area was significantly impacted by xeric
topographic environments and vegetation competition. Continued warm and dry conditions and increased
wildfire activity may delay the natural recovery of ponderosa pine forests, underscoring the importance of
restoration efforts in large, high-severity burn patches.

Resumen
Antecedentes: Los regímenes de fuego están cambiando en bosques dominados por pino ponderosa (Pinus
ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson), lo que suscita preocupación sobre los patrones de vegetación y la resiliencia del
bosque, particularmente en parches quemados con alta severidad. El suroeste de los EEUU ha experimentado un
incremento marcado en el número de incendios que producen grandes parches, en los cuales sobreviven muy
pocos árboles. Esas áreas pueden ser más susceptibles a la pérdida de bosques y a su conversión a tipos
alternativos de vegetación que aquellas áreas cercanas a los bordes del bosque, que tienen más disponibilidad de
fuentes de semillas. Para entender mejor la recuperación del bosque, relevamos la regeneración de pino ponderosa
dentro del borde y en áreas centrales (>200 m del borde) de parches quemados con alta severidad en 10
incendios que quemaron desde 1996 a 2008 a lo largo de Arizona y Nuevo México, EEUU. Específicamente,
comparamos la densidad de la regeneración, altura, y cobertura del dosel en bordes y áreas centrales, y usamos
modelos lineares generalizados para investigar los factores bióticos y abióticos que contribuyen al establecimiento y
densidad de plántulas de pino poderosa.
Resultados: Los parches de bordes y áreas centrales quemados con alta severidad no mostraron diferencias
significativas en la densidad de plántulas, en altura, o cobertura del dosel entre los distintos incendios. El
establecimiento de plántulas fue más probable en sitios mésicos elevados y menos probables cuando el roble
gambel (Quercus gambelii Nutt.) era más abundante. La densidad de plántulas fue impactada negativamente por la
cobertura de arbustos, pastos y roble gambel.
Conclusiones: La densidad de la regeneración varió entre distintos incendios, aunque el análisis de la regeneración
en bordes agregados y parcelas en áreas centrales mostraron que la abundancia en la disponibilidad de semillas no
fue el único factor que limitó la regeneración de pino ponderosa, probablemente debido a los refugios de pinos
sobrevivientes dentro de los parques quemados a alta severidad. Además, nuestros resultados enfatizan que la
regeneración del pino ponderosa en nuestra área de estudios fue impactada significativamente por las condiciones
topográficas xéricas y la competencia de la vegetación. La continuación de condiciones secas y cálidas y el
incremento en la actividad de los incendios puede demorar la recuperación natural de los bosques de pino
ponderosa, subrayando la importancia de los esfuerzos de restauración en grandes parches quemados con alta
severidad.
Introduction
In the last century, fire regimes have shifted drastically
in dry forests across the southwestern US, particularly
those dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa
Lawson & C. Lawson). Prior to Euro-American settle-
ment, frequent, low-severity fire limited fuel accumula-
tions and tree densities and promoted open, uneven-
aged stands (Swetnam and Baisan 1996; Covington et al.
1997). However, human-induced disruptions to fire re-
gimes (e.g., livestock grazing, fire exclusion) have re-
sulted in changes in forest structure and composition
such that they now support anomalous crown fire
(Covington and Moore 1994; Fulé et al. 1997; Moore
et al. 1999; Agee and Skinner 2005; Savage and Mast
2005). Current forest conditions, in combination with a
warmer and drier climate, have given rise to an increase
in high-severity fire in Southwestern forests over the
past several decades (Singleton et al. 2019; Mueller et al.
2020). Given that ponderosa pines are poorly adapted to
such rapid shifts in fire regime and climate, there is
heightened concern that forests will not return to prior
composition, structure, and function. Furthermore, ex-
pected
increases
in
fire
activity,
fire
severity,
and
temperatures may further limit recovery and threaten
the sustainability of ponderosa pine-dominated forest.
One key component of forest resilience (i.e., the ability
of a system to absorb disturbance and return to a similar
state following disturbance) is the recovery of natural re-
generation (Johnstone et al. 2016). Ponderosa pine re-
generation is governed by life history traits that facilitate
persistence under a regime of frequent, low-severity fire
(Pearson 1923). Various adaptations allow mature pines
to survive surface fires including thick, insulating bark,
self-pruning limbs, long needles that protect buds, and
thick bud scales that protect meristem tissue. (Schubert
1974; He et al. 2012; Keeley 2012). Ponderosa pine is an
obligate-seeding species, with heavy, small-winged seed
that does not facilitate long-distance wind dispersal or
rapid colonization of a site after stand-replacing fire.
Following severe wildfire, seedling recruitment is heavily
dependent upon seed availability from adjacent mature
conifers where areas near the edges of high-severity
patches (<200 m from edge) tend to have greater seed-
ling densities (Haire and McGarigal 2010; Chambers
et al. 2016; Harvey et al. 2016; Kemp et al. 2016; Haffey
et al. 2018). However, these adaptive traits are at odds

with rapid changes in fire severity and climate, making
continued survival of ponderosa pine in post-high-
severity fire landscapes uncertain.
Contemporary increases in fire size in the Southwest
are associated with large high-severity burn-patch sizes
outside the historical range of variation (HRV) for dry
forests (Singleton 2020). Over the past three decades,
large high-severity patches >100 ha account for 61% of
the landscape burned at high severity across all forest
types (M. Singleton, Northern Arizona University, Flag-
staff, Arizona, USA, unpublished data). In contrast, his-
torical high-severity burn-patch sizes in dry forests were
typically less than 1 ha (Pearson 1923) but up to 60 ha
(Iniguez et al. 2009). Increasing fire size also corresponds
with large high-severity burn-patch interiors >200 m
from forest edges (i.e., total core area, Singleton 2020)
leaving expansive areas without surviving trees. Since
ponderosa pine regeneration is limited to shorter dis-
tances from seed trees, it is unclear if pine regeneration
will occur within these large, high-severity burn-patch
interiors (hereafter, core areas). Under a warming cli-
mate, altered fire regimes, and a lack of abundant seed
sources, high-severity core areas are predicted to be in-
creasingly susceptible to forest loss and conversion to
non-forest states (Walker et al. 2018; Parks et al. 2019;
Coop et al. 2020). Therefore, understanding regeneration
patterns in large, severely burned areas is critical in
managing for forest resilience.
In addition to seed dispersal, successful ponderosa
pine seedling establishment also depends on site condi-
tions including biotic (i.e., fungal communities, grass
and shrub competition) and abiotic (i.e, topography,
slope, moisture environments) factors (Marcolin et al.
2019; Owen et al. 2019). Site conditions in large, high-
severity burn patches can potentially vary between edge
and core areas, thereby influencing conifer regeneration.
For example, recent greenhouse research points to
slower growth rates of ponderosa pine in high-severity
burn-patch core areas (J. Lippert, Northern Arizona
University, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA, unpublished data),
suggesting that seedbed conditions may be less favorable
or may have less suitable site conditions (i.e., lack of
shade, less moisture) for successful seedling regeneration
than areas closer to patch edges (but see Owen et al.
2020). Furthermore, Owen et al. (2019) found that high-
severity burn-patch core areas have lower density and
richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi, which play a role in
nutrient uptake and plant growth, compared to edge
plots in two Southwestern fires. Since burn-patch edges
contain more available seed trees, shade, and potentially
different moisture environments and fungal communi-
ties, we would expect to see increased seedling densities,
more vigorous growth, and decreased abundance of
other plant species compared to the potentially harsher
environmental
conditions
within
patch
core
areas.
However, more research is needed in assessing differ-
ences between burn-patch edge and core areas across
many fires in the Southwest, particularly if ponderosa
pine regeneration density and growth characteristics
(i.e., height, canopy cover) and vegetation abundance
differ. Understanding such differences will enable man-
agers to make better informed decisions to understand
and manage post-fire landscapes.
Given expected projections of climate and fire activity,
it is also important to understand which biotic and
abiotic factors contribute to regeneration success and
densities in the Southwest. Previous research assessing
drivers of post-fire conifer regeneration in high-severity
burn patches demonstrated highly variable results be-
tween studies (Korb et al. 2019). Thus, it remains un-
clear if this variation is natural (i.e., geographic) or
related to differences in methods. For example, most of
these studies were based on a small number of fires
(Haire and McGarigal 2010; Owen et al. 2017), on small
plot sizes (Haffey et al. 2018), or were conducted outside
the Southwest (Bonnet et al. 2005; Dodson and Root
2013; Chambers et al. 2016; Kemp et al. 2016; Rother
and Veblen 2016). Since there is potential site variation
within burn patches and large geographic variation in
factors that drive conifer regeneration between regions
in the US (Korb et al. 2019), the goal of this study was
to assess ponderosa pine regeneration in high-severity
burn-patch edge and core areas and provide a regionally
focused assessment of the biotic and abiotic factors that
affect ponderosa pine forest recovery across the South-
west. Here we quantified natural regeneration in ten
wildfires in northern Arizona and New Mexico, USA, in
high-severity areas next to the forest edge and in core
areas (>200 m from forest edges) and asked:
(1) Do site conditions such as regeneration
characteristics (density, height, canopy cover) and
vegetation competition differ between edge and
core plots?
(2) What are the abiotic (i.e., topography and climate)
and biotic (i.e., plant competition) drivers of
ponderosa pine establishment?
(3) Given successful regeneration, what are the drivers
of seedling density?
Methods
Study area and site selection
We collected field data during the summers of 2018 and
2019 in high-severity burn patches from ten recent fires
(1996 to 2008) across northern Arizona and New
Mexico (Fig. 1). These fires burned in five national for-
ests and ranged from approximately 1650 to 181 000 ha
in area burned, of which 430 to 60 000 ha burned

severely. We selected fires and burn patches based on
the following criteria: (1) fire must have occurred prior
to 2010 to allow for enough time for natural regener-
ation; (2) fire must have burned in ponderosa pine-
dominated vegetation type; (3) burn patches must not be
reburned or had occurrence of management activities
such as planting or thinning; (4) burn patches must con-
tain core area, defined as area exceeding 200 m distance
from
forest
edge;
and

burn

must
be
accessible by foot. The number of sites per fire were
based on these criteria.
Additional tree species found in the study area were
most commonly Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.),
pinyon pine (Pinus edulis), alligator juniper (Juniperus
deppeana Steud.), Rocky Mountain juniper (Juniperus
scopulorum Sarg.), and oneseed juniper (Juniperus mono-
sperma [Engelm.] Sarg.). Understory plant communities
included a variety of short-statured shrubs including
rubber
rabbitbrush
(Ericameria

[Pall.]
ex
Pursh) G.L. Nesom & Baird), kinnikinnick (Arctostaphy-
los uva-ursi [L.] Spreng.), broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia
sarothrae), Fendler’s ceanothus (Ceanothus fendleri A.
Gray), and big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.).
Taller shrubs included Utah serviceberry (Amelanchier
utahensis Koehne), New Mexico locust (Robinia neo-
mexicana A. Gray), cliffrose (Purshia mexicana [D. Don]
Henrickson), blue elderberry (Sambucus nigra L. spp.
cerulea [Raf.] R. Bolli), skunkbush sumac (Rhus trilobata
Nutt.), gooseberry (Ribes montigenum McClathie), and
wax currant (Ribes cereum Douglas).
The climate within the study area is warm and semi-
arid with monsoon rains in late summer (July to
September) and winter snow providing the primary
sources of moisture for the region (Sheppard et al. 2002).
Within fire perimeters, mean winter (January) and sum-
mer (July) temperatures ranged from −4.6 to 3.5 °C and
13.9 to 23.2 °C, respectively. Mean annual precipitation
ranged from 362 to 878 mm (Prism Climate Group,

Field data collection
We used satellite-derived relative differenced normalized
burn ratio (RdNBR) from the Monitoring Trends in
Burn Severity Project and classified burned areas as high
severity
using
a
field-calibrated
threshold
(≥643;
Eidenshink et al. 2007; Miller and Thode 2007; Singleton
et al. 2019). We used the Southwest Ecological Restor-
ation Unit (ERU) vegetation layer to identify burn
patches that were ponderosa pine-dominated forests.
The ERU framework identifies pre-fire vegetation by
grouping homogenous vegetation classes based on simi-
lar site potential and historical disturbance regimes
(Wahlberg et al. 2014). Using ArcGIS 10.7 (ESRI,
Redlands, California, USA), we generated core areas by
buffering classified high-severity 30 m pixels 200 meters
inward (Haire and McGarigal 2010). We define a high-
severity patch as contiguous area of classified high-
severity pixels within the ponderosa pine vegetation class
that is large enough to contain core area. Within
mapped high-severity burn patches, we established two
transects in a random direction (azimuth 0° to 359°) from
the centroid of the burn patch. Along each transect, we
established two circular 30 m radius plots (0.28 ha), one
near the forest edge (≤60 m) and the other within the core
area (≥200 m). One transect was established when a burn
patch was smaller and its area did not permit two tran-
sects. (Table 1). We did not exclude establishing core plots
near small groups of surviving trees that were undetected
as “unburned islands” during burn severity classification
(generally <10 trees), as this represents the heterogeneity
of burned areas and small islands are important for regen-
erating high-severity patch interiors (Coop et al. 2019;
Coop et al. 2020). Plot sizes were sufficiently large to
minimize the likelihood of seedling absences, to capture
variability in all other biotic variables, and to better match
the coarse-scale satellite-derived variables (Table 2).
Within each plot, we tallied the number of tree seed-
lings >15 cm tall, categorized seedlings into six height
size classes (15 to 30 cm, 30 to 50 cm, 50 to 75 cm, 75
to 100 cm, 100 to 137 cm, >137 cm), and recorded tree
species. If seedlings were greater than 1.37 m tall, we re-
corded diameter at breast height (dbh) or diameter at
root collar for juniper species. We also established a
nested 15 m radius subplot in which we measured the
canopy cover for each seedling by taking perpendicular
measurements of the long and short side of the canopy.
To quantify vegetation competition, we estimated
shrub and grass cover within each plot by establishing
four 30 m transects in each cardinal direction from the
plot center. Along each transect, we sampled shrubs
using the line-intercept method and recorded species.
We also used this method to estimate Quercus gambelii
Nutt. (hereafter, Gambel oak) cover since stems tended
be less than 1.37 m dbh and were most often in dense
thickets. We measured Gambel oak separately from shrub
cover because of its potential facilitative effect on ponder-
osa pine regeneration in Southwestern fires (Owen et al.
2017). We measured grass cover by making ocular esti-
mates within two 1 m2 quadrats along each 30 m transect
spaced at 10 m and 20 m (n = 8 per plot). From the plot
center, we recorded elevation using a global positioning
system and recorded the distance to the nearest living

dataset (4 km resolution) and calculated 30 yr aver-
age (1981 to 2010) and 3 yr post-fire average of pre-
cipitation,
actual
evapotranspiration
(AET),
and
climate water deficit (CWD) (Abatzoglou et al. 2018; Rod-
man et al. 2020a, b). We also calculated a 1 yr post-fire
average of precipitation (Welch et al. 2016). Actual evapo-
transpiration is defined as the evaporative water loss from
land surfaces given the supply of water (precipitation and
snowmelt; Stephenson 1998; Abatzoglou et al. 2018). Since
AET represents the interaction of available energy and
water, it is an index of site productivity (Dobrowski et al.
2015). Climate water deficit is an index of drought stress
and represents the evaporative demand of a given site that
is not met by the available water supply (Stephenson 1998).
We expected that higher densities of regeneration will cor-
respond with high site productivity (i.e., high values of AET
represent high availability of water and energy) and low
drought stress (lower values of CWD).
In addition to biotic variables data collected in the
field, we also calculated abiotic topographical variables
including the slope cosine and sine index (Stage 1976),
abs-aspect (Welch et al. 2016), northness, eastness,
and curvature (Table 2). Following methods in Rod-
man et al. (2020b), we used an image-classification ap-
proach to quantify post-fire canopy cover surrounding
each plot. Specifically, we used the 2017 60 cm 4-band
color infrared aerial photography from NAIP and cal-
culated percent
canopy
cover of
mature conifers
within 60 to 300 m circular windows, at 30 m incre-
ments from each plot center (sensu Rodman et al.
2020b). We performed an accuracy assessment of
these methods by generating 950 random points strati-
fied equally in non-forest and forest classified areas.
We received an overall accuracy of 91% and a kappa
value of 0.83 (Additional file 1)
Statistical analysis
Differences between edge and core plots
We compared three regeneration characteristics and three
vegetation competition variables between edge and core
plots using the one-way Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test (α =
0.05; Kruskal and Wallis 1952) since data were not nor-
mally distributed. Specifically, we compared ponderosa pine
seedling count, height, and canopy cover, as well as percent
grass, Gambel oak, and shrub cover. We calculated ponder-
osa pine seedling height by taking the mean of each seed-
ling’s height class, multiplying it by the number of seedlings
within the height class, and summing by plot. To compare
canopy cover data, we calculated the area of canopy (i.e.,
area of an ellipse) for each seedling and summed by plot.
For cover estimates, we averaged percent grass cover (n = 8
1 m2 quadrats) and averaged shrub and Gambel oak cover
(n = 4 30 m transects) for each plot.
Logistic regression for seedling presence or absence
(hereafter, presence/absence)
To determine which factors influenced ponderosa pine re-
generation, we fit a binomial generalized mixed model
and included fire as a random effect to account for
within-fire variation and potential spatial autocorrelation.
Generalized linear mixed effect models are an extension
of linear mixed models that allow for response variables to
have non-normal distributions and allow for random ef-
fects (Bolker et al. 2009). We completed all statistical ana-
lyses in R version 3.6.1 (R Development Core Team 2019)
and developed the logistic mixed model in the lme4 pack-
age version 1.1-23 using the glmer function with the
family specification set to “binomial” and the link specifi-
cation set to “logit” (Bates et al. 2015).
To improve model stability and increase the likelihood
of model convergence, we scaled all predictor variables
prior to model fitting. We used a stepwise model selec-
tion process based on minimizing the Akaike Informa-
tion Criterion (AIC) statistic and selected models with
the lowest AIC score (Burnham and Anderson 2004). In
cases where competing models had ΔAIC < 2, the most
parsimonious
model
was
selected.
In
addition
to
minimizing AIC, we also minimized predictor collinear-
ity by calculating the variance inflation factor (VIF) for
each candidate model and only retained predictors if the
VIF < 3 among terms.
We assessed logistic model fit using the area under
curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) in
the AUC package version 0.3.0 (Ballings and Van den
Poel 2013), which gives the probability that the model
correctly classifies observed values. AUC values closer to
1 (AUC values >0.8) indicate excellent model prediction
while values near 0.5 indicate that the model is no better
than random (Hosmer and Lemeshow 2000). We also
assessed model fit by calculating the marginal and condi-
tional R2 using the performance package version 0.5.1
(Lüdecke et al. 2020). Marginal R2 describes the pro-
portion of variance explained by fixed effects while
conditional R2 describes the proportion of variance ex-
plained by both fixed and random effects (Nakagawa
and Schielzeth 2013).
Count models for regeneration abundance
To assess drivers of seedling density, we fit ponderosa
pine stems per hectare using a generalized mixed model
(GLMM) using the glmmTMB package version 1.0.1
(Brooks et al. 2017). Since conifer density data were
right skewed (28% of plots did not contain regeneration)
and were overdispersed, we modeled the data with a
negative binomial distribution (family = nbinom2). We
scaled all predictors and used the buildmer package
version 1.6 (Voeten 2020) using the AIC selection criter-
ion to select the best fit model from all possible

predictor variables. To mitigate multicollinearity, we ex-
cluded
correlated
variables
in
the
model
builder
(>|0.70|), but added them independently to candidate
models, and made selections that minimized AIC scores
(Burnham and Anderson 2004). We did not include fire
as a random effect since there was no improvement in
AIC score and since the random effect variance was
close to zero. Thus, to assess model fit, we calculated
only the marginal R2. Residual diagnostics, as well as
over-dispersion and zero-inflation tests were completed
using the DHARMa package version 0.3.2.0 (Hartig 2020).
Results
Differences between edge and core plots
From the 54 plots that we sampled, we counted a total
of 4136 conifer seedlings. Of these post-fire coniferous
seedlings, 3615 seedlings were ponderosa pine (87%).
Although highly variable, we observed ponderosa pine
regeneration
across
all
ten
fires
with
a
mean
regeneration density of 237 (±76 SE) and median density
of 19.5 seedlings ha−1. Mean (median) seedling density
was higher in Arizona fires 325 (57) stems ha−1 com-
pared to New Mexico fires 27 (9) stems ha−1. Mean per-
cent grass cover was the dominant cover type across all
fires (18.1%), followed by Gambel oak (15.2%) and then
shrub cover (11.9%).
There were no significant differences between edge and
core plots in all six regeneration characteristics and vege-
tation
competition
variables
assessed
(Kruskal-Wallis
0.064 ≤χ2 ≤1.177, df = 1, P ≥0.278). Median densities in
edge plots were 28.3 stems ha−1 and 10.6 stems ha−1 in
core plots. Edge and core plots had similar median cover
estimates: edge plots had a median percent shrub, Gambel
oak, and grass cover of 6.2%, 14.5%, and 15.1%, respect-
ively, while core plots had 7.4%, 13.2%, and 16.8%, respect-
ively. Median canopy cover in edge plots was 0.29 m2
compared to 0.05 m2 in core plots.
Seedling presence/absence
We found that a combination of topographic and biotic
variables predicted the presence of ponderosa pine seed-
lings within high-severity burn patches in the study area.
The most important variable predicting seedling pres-
ence was the slope cosine index (β = 2.160, P = 0.006;
Table 3; Fig. 2A), indicating that the likelihood of pine
establishment increased as the interaction of aspect and
slope increased (i.e., on steeper northern slopes). Curva-
ture was another important topographic variable in the
model and was positively related to pine regeneration,
when seedling presence was more likely on convex ter-
rain (β = 1.547, P = 0.021; Table 3; Fig. 2C). Elevation
was also a significant topographic predictor in the model
and had a positive relationship with seedling establish-
ment, for which increasing elevation had a positive effect
on predicting the likelihood of ponderosa pine presence
(β = 18.477, P = 0.029; Table 3; Fig. 2D). Percent Gam-
bel oak cover was the only significant biotic variable in
the model and had a negative effect on the likelihood of
seedling presence (β = −2.315, P = 0.019; Table 3), with
a lower probability of seedling presence with increasing
Gambel oak cover (Fig. 2B).
The area under the ROC curve was 0.93 which indi-
cates that our model had high predictive performance in
discriminating sites that are likely for ponderosa pine re-
generation to establish. Marginal R2 was 0.738 while
conditional R2 was 0.777.
Seedling density
We found that biotic variables largely predicted the abun-
dance of ponderosa pine regeneration in the study area.
Percent Gambel oak cover was the only variable that was
significant in both the seedling presence/absence model
and the seedling abundance model and with the same
directionality (i.e., negative coefficient). Percent Gambel
oak cover had a negative relationship with regeneration
density and was the most important variable in predict-
ing seedling density (P = 0.0001; Table 3), indicating
that, as percent Gambel oak cover increased, the pre-
dicted density of regeneration decreased (Fig. 3D).
Percent grass cover and shrub cover, and distance to
nearest living mature conifer were also negatively
related to ponderosa pine regeneration densities (P ≤0.048;
Table 3, Fig. 3B, C). The only important topographic vari-
able in the model was the northness index, which had a

positive effect on density, with more northern aspects posi-
tively effecting tree densities (P = 0.0005; Fig. 3A).
Our model overpredicted seedling density and had a
median of 76 seedlings ha−1 compared to the median of
19 seedlings ha−1 for the observed data. However, 72%
of the observed values fell within two standard errors of
the predicted values and marginal R2 was 0.862.
Discussion
Following severe wildfire, forest resilience depends on
the recovery of tree species. One goal of this study was
to investigate ponderosa pine forest recovery within
large high-severity core areas >200 m from residual live
forest edges, where seedling densities rapidly decline
(Haire and McGarigal 2010). To understand differences
in recovery patterns within high-severity burn patches,
we compared seedling and site characteristics between
core and edge areas. We also identified factors that
contribute to ponderosa pine establishment and abun-
dance in the Southwest. Our results highlighted three
important findings with respect to high-severity burn
patches: (1) ponderosa pine seedling densities, height,
and canopy cover do not significantly differ between
patch core and edge areas across fires; (2) the likelihood
of ponderosa pine establishment is largely controlled by
topographic variables; and (3) vegetation competition
limits seedling abundance.
Are patch interiors more vulnerable?
Our results suggest that ponderosa pine regeneration
characteristics as well as competitive abiotic environ-
ments were similar across high-severity burn patches.
That is, we found that ponderosa pine seedling density,
height, and canopy cover did not significantly differ

between areas within the interior of high-severity burn
patches and areas adjacent to forest edges. Similarly, we
found that vegetative competition within high-severity
core areas did not significantly differ in percent grass,
shrub, and Gambel oak cover between patch edge and
core areas. Within high-severity burn patches, many
studies have documented that seedling densities signifi-
cantly decline past 150 to 200 m from mature conifers
(Haire
and
McGarigal
2010;
Haffey
et
al.
2018).
Although we documented fewer seedlings in core plots,
median densities were similar to edge plots across our
study area, thus suggesting that core areas may not be
experiencing complete regeneration failures. Our results
were likely due to fire “refugia,” or unburned islands of
surviving trees remaining after wildfire (Krawchuk et al.
2016). Fire refugia are important in providing seed
sources
and
are
critical
for
natural
regeneration,
especially within large contiguous patches of tree mor-
tality (Coop et al. 2019). Within our dataset, 31% of core
plots had at least one living mature conifer that was <
150 m from plot center, which highlights the heterogen-
eity of the burn mosaic within severe fires and patch in-
teriors. Interestingly, within four core plots, we observed
seedling densities ranging from 170 622 stems ha−1 at
distances 272 to 513 m from the nearest living pine
within the Bridgerknoll and Rodeo-Chediski fires. This
finding suggests that, despite increasing distances from
seed sources, other long-distance dispersal mechanisms,
such as animals, may play an important role in regener-
ating some burn patches (Haire and McGarigal 2010;
Owen et al. 2017). In contrast to our findings, Owen
et al. (2017) and Owen et al. (2020) found that edge
plots within the Pumpkin and Rodeo-Chediski fires in
Arizona had significantly more seedling densities than

Arizona and New Mexico, USA, in 2018 and 2019. Solid blue lines are the marginal effects of each predictor while other covariates are held at
their mean. Blue shaded ribbon represents the 95% confidence interval of predicted values. Ponderosa pine seedling densities are greater on (A)
northern aspects, but are limited in areas with greater (B) grass cover, (C) shrub cover, and (D) Gambel oak cover, and (E) at greater distances
from nearest seed tree. See Additional file 3 for graphs with observed data

core plots, and found no differences in seedling height
or other growth characteristics between plot types.
These contrasts in findings were likely due to the in-
crease in fires sampled in our study potentially capturing
more between-fire variability across the Southwest.
Additionally, we found that seedling canopy cover and
height in core areas were not significantly different from
those in edge areas. These findings suggest that, since
seedling vigor (i.e., canopy cover) and growth rate (i.e.,
height) are similar, site conditions and resources to assist
regeneration success, such as moisture availability or soil
nutrients, are also similar. Furthermore, vegetation cover
was similar between plot types, suggesting that a similar
level of competition was also present. It is important to
note, however, that seedling densities and all other site
characteristics were highly variable across fires. Although
our goal was to assess the effects of high-severity fire on
ponderosa pine regeneration across the Southwest, it will
be beneficial to assess post-fire recovery within fires for
more targeted vulnerability assessments.
Seedling presence/absence
Overall, our model suggested that ponderosa pine seed-
ling presence in high-severity burn patches was most
strongly influenced by topographic variables. Similar to
other studies, we found that increasing elevation in-
creased the likelihood of seedling presence (Haire and
McGarigal 2010; Dodson and Root 2013; Chambers
et al. 2016; Rother and Veblen 2016; Haffey et al. 2018;
Lopez Ortiz et al. 2019). Environmental gradients, such
as increasing elevation, also reflect gradients in resource
availability, particularly soil moisture and decreased
heat load that are important for seedling establish-
ment (Dodson and Root 2013; Chambers et al. 2016;
Kemp et al. 2016). Additionally, we found that in-
creasing slope cosine index and curvature had a posi-
tive
effect
on
seedling
presence
in
our
logistic
regression model. Although areas with greater slopes
tend to have dry, shallow soils that may limit regener-
ation density, a study in inland Northwest USA found
that
shade-intolerant
coniferous
species
are
more
likely to occur on rising slopes due to the increased
light
availability (Shen and Nelson
2018).
In our
study, the likelihood of ponderosa pine occurrence in-
creased on more northern aspects on greater slopes,
highlighting the importance of moisture (north as-
pects) and micro-climates for seedling establishment
(Ziegler et al. 2017). Furthermore, according to our
model, the shape of the slope was also important.
Topographic curvature is commonly used to identify
convex, concave, or flat surfaces to assess the move-
ment of water and subsequent erosion processes. Upwardly
convex (positive curvature) surfaces such as hills or
ridges indicate areas that decelerate water movement
and have divergent water flow, while concave curvature
represent depressions and valleys that have convergent
flow and accelerate water movement. Seedling estab-
lishment may be more probable on convex surfaces be-
cause post-fire soil erosion is lessened and, thus, may
be more favorable for seed germination. However,
these results may also be attributed to an interactive
effect of curvature and Gambel oak cover. Gambel oak
generally dominated drainage bottoms (i.e., concave
terrain) throughout our study area, so it is likely that
competition is driving seedling establishment on con-
vex slopes. Given that unburned patches are associated
with moister, cooler land surfaces, increased Gambel
oak in drainages over time may have important eco-
logical implications for future fire refugia and, in turn,
further decrease ponderosa pine regeneration (Dwire
and Kauffman 2003).
Seedling density
We found that post-fire ponderosa pine regeneration
density in high-severity burn patches across the Southwest
was most influenced by vegetation competition. Although
the composition of understory varied across the study
area, we found that increasing percent grass, shrub, and
Gambel oak cover negatively affected ponderosa pine
seedling density. Competition between ponderosa pine
seedling and coexisting vegetation can vary greatly de-
pending on species and other factors such as soil type,
moisture availability, or plant root structure (Abella 2008;
Abella and Fulé 2008; Puhlick et al. 2012). For example,
grasses quickly develop superficial roots following fire and
can deplete soil moisture to outcompete ponderosa pine
regeneration, particularly during the pre-monsoon period
(Pearson 1942). Gambel oak also has an immediate
post-fire competitive advantage over ponderosa pine
because it vigorously resprouts following severe crown
fire and grows rhizomatous roots that absorb water
deep within the soil profile (Abella and Fulé 2008;
Kaufmann et al. 2016).
Previous studies have demonstrated similar competitive
(i.e., negative) relationships between post-fire conifer re-
generation and grasses, Gambel oak, and other resprout-
ing shrubs (Bonnet et al. 2005; Savage and Mast 2005;
Haire and McGarigal 2010; Roccaforte et al. 2012; Welch
et al. 2016; Rodman et al. 2020b). However, vegetation
competition was not a ubiquitous factor that affected
conifer regeneration across all studies in the western US,
as results from these studies varied both regionally and by
fire (see Owen et al. 2017). The Southwest is a region
where resprouting shrubs and grasses are rapidly recolon-
izing sites after high-severity fire (Barton 2002; Savage and
Mast 2005), and our results provide further evidence that
herbaceous and woody plants are limiting ponderosa pine
tree densities.
Singleton et al. Fire Ecology           (2021) 17:14 
Page 11 of 15

Unexpectedly, we found that seedling density was
not affected by percent canopy cover of surrounding
mature conifers, suggesting that higher (or lower)
seed availability does not
yield higher (or lower)
densities, at least within the study region. This may
be in part due to the metric we used, whereas metrics
that incorporate both proximity and abundance of
multiple seed sources (i.e., distance-weighted density)
show stronger correlations with tree densities (Haire
and McGarigal 2010; Coop et al. 2019; Downing et al.
2019). However, our finding suggests that seed abun-
dance is not the only factor that limits post-fire tree
recovery, and that not all mature trees produce abun-
dant seed. For example, Puhlick et al. (2012) found a
strong positive correlation of seed tree superiority
(i.e., dominant seed tree) and ponderosa pine seedling
densities in unburned areas across Arizona, suggesting
that the size and productivity of mature trees plays a
larger role in regeneration than maturity alone. Future
studies could use Puhlick et al. (2012) methods for
identifying superior seed trees in high-severity burn
patches to better understand their influence compared
to seed tree abundance on post-fire recovery.
Although ponderosa pine seed germination is highly
dependent on climate, our models did not identify cli-
mate as a significant factor in seedling establishment or
density. Annual climate conditions have become warmer
and drier in the Southwest in recent decades (Mueller
et al. 2020). As a result, post-fire environments are in-
creasingly moisture stressed and have less suitable cli-
matic windows for regeneration (Savage et al. 2013).
Studies in the Southwest implicate precipitation as an
important factor in influencing increased tree densities
(Pearson 1923; Cooper 1960; Puhlick et al. 2012) and
drought conditions that favor the establishment of dense
shrubfields or grasses (Savage et al. 2013). Although
there is growing evidence that climatic conditions, par-
ticularly drought stress, reduces conifer establishment
and densities in montane coniferous forests (Rother and
Veblen 2016; Stevens-Rumann et al. 2018; Rodman et al.
2020a, b), climate variables were not an influential driver
in our study. This may be in part due to seasonal or an-
nual climate conditions playing a larger role in episodic
tree recruitment (Iniguez et al. 2016), which were not
thoroughly assessed in this study. Furthermore, studies
that document climate factors as strong predictors of
tree densities have utilized fine-resolution (250 m) gridded
datasets that may better capture smaller topo-climatic var-
iations compared to coarser resolutions (4 km or 800 m;
Rodman et al. 2020a, b). Thus, further research is needed
in applying downscaled climatic datasets to better assess
impacts of climate on seedling regeneration in the
Southwest. It is well known, however, that warmer, drier
conditions can stress trees and can trigger higher rates of
tree mortality or inhibit conifer germination (Breshears
et al. 2009; Savage et al. 2013). Under adverse climatic
conditions, in conjunction with contemporary shifts in fire
regime, Southwestern ponderosa pine recruitment rates
may be increasingly constrained.
Management implications and conclusions
Assessing regeneration in high-severity burn patches
within ten fires across the US Southwest allowed us to
describe general patterns. First, we documented that ag-
gregated core areas of high-severity burn patches are not
regenerating differently or have different abundance of
vegetation competition
than aggregated
forest
edge
areas. Although patch interiors are farther away from a
greater abundance of seed sources, seed abundance is
not the sole cause of limited regeneration. Importantly,
our results suggest that ponderosa pine regeneration in
edge and core areas are equally constrained by the abi-
otic and biotic factors assessed in this study. Second, we
found that factors driving both edge- and core-area
seedling establishment and densities are largely related
to topographic moisture gradients and competition, re-
spectively. Areas that are less xeric (i.e., higher in eleva-
tion and on north aspects) were more favorable to
successful regeneration, while shrub, grass, and Gambel
oak cover were increasing their competitive pressure and
limiting tree densities. Although we found strong rela-
tionships of predictor variables with regeneration in this
study, seedling regeneration may also be due to other
factors that were not assessed, such as soil type and con-
ditions, ectomycorrhizal associations, nurse logs, plant
associations, and pre-fire basal area. Further research is
needed in examining these and other potential factors.
Overall, we observed regeneration in all fires, but abun-
dance was highly variable among edge and core plots
across different patches in fires that burned between 1996
and 2008. Overall, we observed that seven out of ten fires
had median conifer densities that do not meet the mini-
mum 125 stems ha−1 target that will produce mature trees
that are consistent with historical range of variation
(HRV) and ecological restoration targets (Reynolds et al.
2013; Ouzts et al. 2015). Although we documented low
seedling densities across fires, the seedlings currently
found at these sites may be the first of several regeneration
pulses over time and, thus, ponderosa pine could poten-
tially recover to its previous density (Haire and McGarigal
2010). However, it remains unclear exactly how much
time and the minimum number of seedlings needed to re-
forest an area to its HRV, especially under contemporary
conditions. It is likely that subsequent reburning and in-
creasing competitive pressure from other plant species,
along with warmer and drier conditions, will continue to
affect mechanisms of ponderosa pine forest recovery and

resilience in Southwestern post-high-severity fire land-
scapes (Coop et al. 2016).
Wildfires are becoming larger and more severe in the
Southwest, resulting in large patches of high-severity burn
areas (Singleton 2020) that can potentially threaten the sus-
tainability of dry, forested systems (Coop et al. 2020). Given
this reality, managers need to develop strategies to create
more resilient conditions. To this end, we suggest increased
use of managed fires during shoulder fire seasons when
weather and fuel conditions are milder (Young et al. 2020)
and therefore less likely to create more large high-severity
burn core areas (Singleton 2020). Managed fires are an ef-
fective tool for reducing fuel loads at landscape scales and,
thus, reducing the size and severity of future fires (North
et al. 2012; Hunter et al. 2014). In addition to avoidance of
high-severity burn patches, we also recommend that man-
agers identify and map areas more likely to develop regen-
eration based on the important topographic variables
described in this study. Given that post-fire seedlings are
often vulnerable to other disturbances, these maps could
then be used to protect reforested areas from future distur-
bances including future fires that can reset the system and
contribute to type-conversion of forested systems (Savage
et al. 2013; Coop et al. 2020).
