Woody debris and tree regeneration dynamics
following severe wildfires in Arizona ponderosa
pine forests
John P. Roccaforte, Peter Z. Fulé, W. Walker Chancellor, and Daniel C. Laughlin
Abstract: Severe forest fires worldwide leave behind large quantities of dead woody debris and regenerating trees that can
affect future ecosystem trajectories. We studied a chronosequence of severe fires in Arizona, USA, spanning 1 to 18 years
after burning to investigate postfire woody debris and regeneration dynamics. Snag densities varied over time, with predomi-
nantly recent snags in recent fires and broken or fallen snags in older fires. Coarse woody debris peaked at > 60 Mg/ha in
the time period 6–12 years after fire, a value higher than previously reported in postfire fuel assessments in this region.
However, debris loadings on fires older than 12 years were within the range of recommended management values (11.2–
44.8 Mg/ha). Overstory and regeneration were most commonly dominated by sprouting deciduous species. Ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa C. Lawson var. scopulorum Engelm.) overstory and regeneration were completely lacking in 50% and
57% of the sites, respectively, indicating that many sites were likely to experience extended periods as shrublands or grass-
lands rather than returning rapidly to pine forest. More time is needed to see whether these patterns will remain stable, but
there are substantial obstacles to pine forest recovery: competition with sprouting species and (or) grasses, lack of seed sour-
ces, and the forecast of warmer, drier climatic conditions for coming decades.
Résumé : Partout dans le monde les feux de forêt sévères laissent derrière de grandes quantités de bois mort et de régénéra-
tion qui peuvent influencer la trajectoire future des écosystèmes. Nous avons étudié une chronoséquence de feux sévères en
Arizona, aux États-Unis, allant de 1 à 18 ans après un feu pour examiner la dynamique de la régénération et des débris li-
gneux après feu. La densité des chicots variait dans le temps : les chicots récents étaient surtout associés aux feux récents et
les chicots cassés ou renversés étaient surtout associés aux feux plus vieux. Les débris ligneux grossiers ont culminé à plus
de 60 Mg/ha durant la période de 6–12 ans après feu; c’est une valeur plus élevée que celle qui a été rapportée dans les
évaluations des combustibles après feu dans cette région. Cependant, les charges de débris associés aux feux plus vieux que
12 ans se situaient dans les limites des valeurs recommandées en aménagement (11,2–44,8 Mg/ha). L’étage dominant et la
régénération étaient le plus souvent dominés par des espèces décidues qui produisent des rejets. L’étage dominant et la régé-
nération de pin ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa C. Lawson var. scopulorum Engelm.) étaient complètement absents dans res-
pectivement 50 et 57 % des stations, indiquant que plusieurs stations allaient probablement passer de longues périodes sous
forme d’arbustaie ou de prairie plutôt que de retourner rapidement à une forêt de pin. Il faut plus de temps pour savoir si
ces patrons demeureront stables mais il y d’importants obstacles au retour de la forêt de pin : la compétition des espèces qui
produisent des rejets ou celle des graminées, l’absence de sources de graines, ainsi que les conditions climatiques plus chau-
des et plus sèches prévues au cours des prochaines décennies.

Introduction
Wildfire events initiate complex sequences of dead wood
decay and development of new fuel and habitat structures
over time (Haslem et al. 2011). Contemporary fires in south-
western US forests are increasingly large and severe (Littell
et al. 2009; Miller et al. 2009), paralleling trends in Europe
and Asia (Pausas et al. 2008). The postfire environment is
characterized by woody debris and regenerating plant com-
munities, the structure and composition of which contribute
to future fire behavior and effects (Passovoy and Fulé 2006).
These attributes also comprise important habitat elements
such as snags (Chambers and Mast 2005), substrate for
wood-decay fungi (Cornwell et al. 2009), and plant commun-
ities (Swanson et al. 2010). In contrast to ecosystems adapted
to infrequent, severe fire disturbance such as Chilean Notho-
fagus forests (Veblen et al. 2008), southwestern US forests
are dominated by species adapted to frequent, low-severity
fires (Barton 2002). The fuel complex of woody debris and
postfire regeneration left behind following uncharacteristi-

cally severe wildfires in southwestern US forests poses im-
portant ecological and management issues. Retaining woody
debris has the advantages of minimizing disturbance to the
recently burned site, maintaining high levels of organic mate-
rial for wildlife habitat and soil development, and avoiding
opposition to postfire logging (McIver and Starr 2001;
Beschta et al. 2004). Postwildfire coarse woody debris
(CWD) is often considered to represent a hazardous level of
fuel that could support reburning (e.g., U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) 2004), although Thompson and Spies
(2009) found that a salvage-logged and replanted forest
burned more severely than the surrounding forest. Removal
of fire-killed timber may also bring economic benefits
(McIver and Starr 2001).
Despite the importance of these issues, underscored in
2011
by
the
largest
fires
ever
recorded
in
Arizona
(217 750 ha) and New Mexico (63 400 ha), relatively little
quantitative information exists about the quantity and quality
of postwildfire fuels in southwestern forests. With limited
empirical data, managers are often left with rough estimates
(USDA 2004) or anecdotal accounts as the basis for making
complex and controversial decisions about postfire manage-
ment such as deciding to remove fuels through logging or to
retain fuels on site. Information regarding the amount, ar-
rangement, potential fire hazard, and dynamics of postwild-
fire fuels is limited to a few studies of tree mortality and (or)
snag dynamics (e.g., Harrington 1996; Chambers and Mast
2005; Ganey and Vojta 2005, 2011). Only one study has spe-
cifically looked at unmanaged (unlogged) postwildfire fuels
in the US Southwest, around the San Francisco Peaks in
northern Arizona (Passovoy and Fulé 2006). On a chronose-
quence of seven fires in forests previously dominated by pon-
derosa pine (Pinus ponderosa C. Lawson var. scopulorum
Engelm.) (see Table 1 for scientific names of species), CWD
ranged from 3.3 Mg/ha to a high of 41.3 Mg/ha (Passovoy
and Fulé 2006); these values did not exceed the range of “op-
timal” debris loading in dry coniferous forests recommended
by Brown et al. (2003). Brown et al. (2003) considered the
tradeoff between the benefits of CWD for wildlife habitat
and a source of nutrients for productivity and the potentially
negative effects of soil heating and fire hazard. They recom-
mended an optimal level ranging between 11.2 and 44.8 Mg/
ha of CWD in warm, dry forests (Brown et al. 2003). A max-
imum level 50% higher, up to 67.2 Mg/ha, was considered
suitable for cool and lower subalpine forest types (Brown et
al. 2003).
The postwildfire environment is important not only in
terms of debris dynamics, but also for influencing regenera-
tion and future successional trajectories. Postfire environ-
ments demonstrate a wide range of conditions even within
the southwestern ponderosa pine type, reflecting the com-
plexity of factors and mechanisms that influence vegetation
change after burning. Savage and Mast (2005) studied 10
ponderosa pine forests in Arizona and New Mexico that
burned severely in the mid-20th century, finding two main
patterns of response: (i) high pine regeneration that returned
the forest to a “hyperdense” condition considered vulnerable
to another severe fire (five of 10 sites), or (ii) deflection to a
nonforested grassland or shrubland state (four of 10 sites).
They also found one site with low-density pine regeneration,
a response consistent with historical patterns in these forests
(one of 10 sites). Given that three to five decades had passed
since these fires, Savage and Mast (2005) hypothesized that
the alternative states could be indefinitely self-perpetuating
rather than successional stages leading back to ponderosa
pine forest. Haire and McGarigal (2010) examined spatial
landscape patterns on one of the same fires and an additional
Arizona fire, finding that the distance to the nearest surviving
seed sources was negatively correlated with regeneration for
nonsprouting species. They concluded that forest recovery
was occurring on these two sites but at slow rates, impeded
by large patches without seed sources (Haire and McGarigal
2008). Barton (2002) showed that sprouting oaks became the
dominant species after severe fire in a mixed pine–oak forest.
Strom and Fulé (2007) extended the same type of compari-
son using a forest simulation model to project future forest
development following the severe 2002 Rodeo-Chediski fire
in Arizona. Postfire regeneration was predicted to have a
multidecadal to century-long impact on ecosystem composi-
tion and structure, with sprouting shrubs forecasted to domi-
nate formerly dense pine sites (Strom and Fulé 2007). The
question of whether or not pine forests will recover over var-

ious spatial and temporal scales has many implications for
management of habitat, natural resources, and carbon dynam-
ics (Dore et al. 2008).
In the present study, our goal is to provide quantitative in-
formation about postwildfire woody debris and regeneration
dynamics over a broader region than that studied by Passo-
voy and Fulé (2006). The results will provide a defensible
basis for environmental analysis of future fire hazard, as well
as information about key forest features such as snags,
downed woody debris, and postfire regeneration. We had
three specific objectives:
1. to measure snags, fallen trees, surface fuels, fire-surviving
trees, and postfire regeneration on a chronosequence of
severely burned, unlogged ponderosa pine forests across
the state of Arizona;
2. to model nonlinear responses of woody debris and surface
fuels as functions of time since fire to provide guidance
for assessment of postfire impacts; and
3. to assess postfire regeneration in terms of probable future
successional trajectories.
Materials and methods
Study sites
We selected sites within ponderosa pine forests that had
experienced severe crown fires (Table 2; Fig. 1), avoiding
the area around Flagstaff, Arizona, because it had recently
been studied by Passovoy and Fulé (2006) using nearly iden-
tical methods. Prior to sampling, we talked with resource
managers and consulted fire records to make a list of all the
candidate fires. We used the following criteria to select fires:
(i) fire sites were ponderosa pine dominated (> 67% prefire
basal area); (ii) fires burned severely (> 67% mortality of pre-
fire basal area); (iii) no postfire logging or second fire oc-
curred
in
the
last
30
years;
(iv)
slopes
≤45%;
and
(v) minimum contiguous area of severe burning of 260 ha.
After field reconnaissance, we selected 11 suitable fires
throughout Arizona (Fig. 1). We sampled 14 sites (three of
the larger fires had two sites each). Sampling covered all six
National Forests in Arizona and Grand Canyon National Park
(Table 2). The National Forest sites (other than the Pine
Mountain site) had been harvested and grazed, but the Na-
tional Park site had no tree harvesting and limited grazing
prior to 1919. We did not observe evidence of tree harvesting
at the Pine Mountain site. All sites were dominated by ma-
ture trees prior to fires. The only known postfire conifer
planting occurred in some areas of the two Dude fire sites
(Jeffrey L. Leonard, Tonto National Forest, personal commu-
nication).
Field methods
Prior to field data collection, we used a GIS to locate po-
tential plots (spaced 200 m apart) at each site using a random
starting point. In the field, we selected plots from among the
potential plots that lay within the largest area of severe burn-
ing and farthest away from living trees (i.e., unburned forest
or trees that survived the fire). We attempted to select plots
that were adjacent to each other when possible, but occasion-
ally, adjacent plots were rejected to avoid roads, slopes >
45%, or areas that were not burned severely. We installed
thirty 90 m2 plots at each site except for the Bridger-Knoll

site, where we were only able to sample nine plots that fit the
selection criteria. Slope, aspect, and elevation were recorded
at each plot.
At each plot, we measured forest floor depth, fine woody
debris (FWD, < 7.62 cm diameter), and CWD (> 7.62 cm di-
ameter) with a 15 m planar transect (Brown 1974). We in-
ventoried FWD in three size classes (0–0.64 cm, 0.65–
2.54 cm, 2.55–7.62 cm diameter) (Brown 1974). These size
classes correspond to 1, 10, and 100 h moisture time-lag
classes, whereas CWD corresponds to the 1000 h time-lag
class. Decay of the CWD was classified following Maser et
al.’s (1979) five-class system, where class 1 is a freshly fallen
tree with fine twigs present, class 2 is the absence of fine
twigs, class 3 is rotten on the outside but solid in the core,

class 4 is entirely rotten with small, soft, blocky pieces, and
class 5 is almost totally decomposed. Classes 1 and 2 were
considered “sound” wood and the remaining classes were
considered “rotten”. We took the 1 and 10 h fuel class meas-
urements in the first 1.8 m of the fuel transect, the 100 h fuel
class in the first 3.7 m, and the 1000 h fuel class along the
entire length of the transect. We measured duff (fermentation
and humus layers) and litter depth (cm) every 3 m for a total
of six points per transect. We calculated FWD and CWD bio-
mass using equations from Brown (1974) with southwestern
species specific coefficients from Sackett (1980). To capture
the complexity of the arrangement of intersecting or “jack-
strawed” logs (Passovoy and Fulé 2006), we measured the
distance from the intersection of the planar transect with
each sampled log to the next log that crossed the sampled
log. We also noted the diameter (cm) of every log that
touched a tallied log, where “touch” was defined as an inter-
section of the centerlines of each log.
We measured all living trees and standing and fallen snags
on a 90 m2 (15 m × 6 m) plot centered on each planar trans-
ect, thereby linking surface and canopy fuels to the same plot
points. We measured species, condition (e.g., live, declining,
dead (see snag classes below)), diameter at breast height
(DBH, cm), and total height (m) of all living trees and snags

taller than breast height (137 cm). We also measured crown
base height (m) of living trees. We conducted a visual assess-
ment of each tree (living or dead) to determine if it was alive
or dead before the wildfire to estimate tree survival. Regener-
ation (trees < 137 cm tall) was tallied by species and height
class on a 9 m2 (3 m × 3 m) subplot located within the
90 m2 overstory plot. For context, Minor (1964) reported an
average of 14.3 years (range 12.5–16.2) for ponderosa seed-
lings to grow to 137 cm in height. State of decay from Tho-
mas et al. (1979) was recorded for all snags: “recent” (snags
still retaining bark and fine twigs), “loose-bark” (snags with
some bark sloughing off the bole), “clean” (snags with bark
mostly fallen off), “broken” (snags broken at some point
above breast height), and “fallen” (snags broken below breast
height).
Data analysis
We used generalized additive models (GAMs) to analyze
and illustrate the nonlinear relationship between forest struc-
tural attributes (i.e., snag density and fuel loading) and time
since fire. The GAMs were performed at the site level (n =
14), i.e., average values were calculated across the plots
within each site, and these averages were used in the analy-
sis. We used GAMs because previous work has demonstrated
that snag density and fuel loading vary nonlinearly over time
since fire (Passovoy and Fulé 2006). A GAM is a nonpara-
metric extension of a generalized linear model in which the
response is efficiently modeled as a smoothed function of
the predictor (Wood 2006). We used the cubic spline basis
(bs = “cr”) in the “mgcv” package in R version 2.12.0 to fit
the models (Wood 2006; R Development Core Team 2010).
The nonlinear function is fit by dividing the data into sec-
tions. Cubic polynomials are fit to the data in each section
with the added constraints that the values and the first and
second derivatives are equal at the endpoints of each section.
These constraints eliminate any discontinuities in the curve,
ensuring a smooth and continuous function along the entire
span of the independent variable. The solutions are therefore
data-driven and can range from simple linear to complex
nonlinear smoothed functions. We limited the complexity of
the fit by allowing no more than four degrees of freedom for
the time-since-fire term (i.e., we set the parameter k = 5). We
show the fitted models to illustrate how average snag den-
sities and fuel loadings at each site vary over time since fire.
We chose a = 0.10 to avoid type II errors given the limited
sample size of the study (n = 14).
Results
Snag dynamics
Recent snag density was highest in recent fires and then
declined rapidly as time since fire increased (Fig. 2a). In the
fires that occurred 1–2 years ago, mean density of recent
snags was 366 snags/ha. Approximately 70% of the stems in
the recent fires were classified as recent snags. Mean density
of recent snags dropped to 80 snags/ha for the middle-aged
fires (4–7 years since fire), and only 1.5 snags/ha remained
in the oldest fires (11–18 years since fire). Loose-bark snags
were present at all but one site (Pot fire) and were most
abundant 5 years following fire (Fig. 2b). Clean snags oc-
curred on 10 of 14 sites but had the lowest abundance of
any of the snag classes and showed no trend with time; less
than 5% of the stems were categorized as clean snags when
averaged across all sites (Fig. 2c). Broken snags occurred at
13 of 14 sites at relatively low densities, peaking in the mid-
range of time since fire (Fig. 2d). Fallen snag densities rose
rapidly in the first few years following fire and remained rel-
atively high through the oldest fire dates (Fig. 2e). Time
since fire explained significant variation in recent and loose-

bark snags but was not a significant predictor of the other
snag condition classes (Table 3). Averaged across all sites,
recent, loose-bark, and clean snags > 50 cm DBH (i.e., snags
potentially valuable for wildlife) comprised less than 5% of
the total snags. However, there was considerable variability
from site to site: recent snags > 50 cm DBH ranged from
0% to 24.5%, loose-bark snags > 50 cm DBH ranged from
0% to 9.4%, and clean snags > 50 cm DBH ranged from 0%
to 33.4% of total snag density.
Woody debris and forest floor
Coarse woody debris (CWD) loading was much higher at
older sites than more recently burned sites, peaking at > 60
Mg/ha in the time period of 6–12 years after fire (Fig. 3a).
The CWD loadings in the peak time period exceeded the
upper limit of “optimal” CWD in dry coniferous forests sug-
gested by Brown et al. (2003), shown with horizontal dotted
lines in Fig. 3a. Fifty-eight percent of plots in the sites meas-
ured 1–2 years after fire had no CWD at all; only 12% of
plots had no CWD in the fires older than two years. When
CWD was encountered in the 1- to 2-year-old fires, 90%–
100% of the wood did not contact any other piece of CWD,
but jackstrawed CWD wood contacts did occur in an average
of 74% of plots in older fires. Where jackstrawing occurred

frequently enough to calculate an average distance to the
nearest CWD contact (fires > 2 years old), the mean distance
to the next CWD piece was 2.0 ± 0.3 m and did not show a
trend with time since fire. FWD loadings were low in the
first few years after fire but rose quickly to a stable level
around 7 Mg/ha by 6–12 years after fire (Fig. 3b). Forest
floor depth had a similar trend with time since fire, rising to
approximately 1.5 cm by 7 years after fire (Fig. 3c). Time
since fire explained significant variation in all the fuel varia-
bles (Table 3). CWD switched from predominantly sound to
predominantly rotten debris around 16 years after fire
(Fig. 3d). Forest floor depths were predominantly comprised
of duff beginning around 14 years after fire (Fig. 3f).
Forest structure and regeneration
Forest structural characteristics and regeneration were
highly variable and did not change in a consistent pattern
with time since fire. Although a number of the postfire sites
were very dense with trees — five of 14 sites had > 1000
trees/ha — only one site had a basal area > 4 m2/ha (Table 4).
Six sites had no surviving trees from before the fire. Of the
remainder, 20% or fewer of the trees were survivors except
at two recent sites where the survivors were sparse, averaging
four–seven trees/ha, but those made up most or all of the
trees at these sites (Table 4). Ponderosa pine, the dominant
species at all sites prior to fire, was absent from the living
tree overstory at half of the sites and represented less than
20 trees/ha at five other sites; only two sites averaged over
100 pines/ha (Table 4). Other conifers were absent at eight
sites, and fewer than 10 trees/ha were present at three others;
only three sites averaged over 100 other conifers/ha (Table 4).
Deciduous species (e.g., quaking aspen, New Mexico locust,
several oak species (see Table 1)) were numerically dominant
wherever they were encountered, on 10 of the 14 sites. In
contrast to conifer density, only one site with deciduous spe-
cies averaged fewer than 100 stems/ha; nine sites had over
500 stems/ha.
Regeneration (trees < 137 cm tall) was variable across
sites (Fig. 4), with standard errors high relative to means (Ta-
ble 5). Conifer regeneration was very sparse (Table 5). Pines
were absent at eight sites and other conifers were absent at
12 sites. Total conifer regeneration exceeded 80 stems/ha at
only three sites (two of which had some postfire planting, on
the Dude fire), but one fire (Pine Mountain) had exception-
ally high pine regeneration, over 11 000 stems/ha. All but
two sites had regeneration by deciduous species and they

were dominant at all but two of the sites where they occurred
(Table 5). Sprouting species dominated: Gambel oak was the
majority of regeneration at the Bridger-Knoll fire and aspen
sprouted prolifically at the Outlet and Poplar fires. New Mex-
ico locust dominated regeneration at the Warm fire sites. We
analyzed potential effects of surface fuels on regeneration but
found no significant relationships.
Discussion
Chronosequence studies
The underlying assumption that space can be substituted
for time in a chronosequence is always uncertain and may be
especially problematic in a study such as this one, which in-
cluded study sites separated by as much as 400 km, a variety
of differences in site conditions and history, and a range from
the lower to upper ecotone of ponderosa pine dominated for-
ests. However, this situation is an inherent issue in studies of
severe fires because they occur sporadically in space and
time, with substantial variation in prefire management his-
tory, prefire fuels, and fire intensity. Our choices of burned
sites were further constrained by the fact that we sought un-
logged sites to measure fuel dynamics, but postfire logging
occurred routinely in the US Southwest until the mid-1990s.

Mountain fire); (c) abundant oak regeneration (Aspen fire); and (d) no tree regeneration (Pot fire).

Evidence supporting the application of the present data set
as a reasonable space-for-time approximation includes the in-
ternal consistency of the data, as indicated by the generally
significant fit of models with time since fire as a predictor
variable that explained a moderate to high amount of varia-
tion, as well as consistency with snag, fuel loading, and post-
fire structure data reported by Chambers and Mast (2005),
Passovoy and Fulé (2006), Savage and Mast (2005), and
others discussed below. Based on this evidence, we suggest
that the present data set is a useful survey of severely burned
ponderosa pine sites in Arizona and that resource managers
can apply these data and models, with thoughtful caveats, as
a guide to estimating changes following future wildfires.
Postfire snag and fuel dynamics
Recent snags varied strongly and significantly with time
since fire, but the other snag condition classes were more
variable. Model results indicated that the majority of recent
snags (≈75%) would be expected to transition to a subse-
quent category by 7 years after fire (Fig. 2f). The relative
densities in snag categories closely paralleled the patterns ob-
served by Passovoy and Fulé (2006) in their chronosequence
study in northern Arizona, which covered a longer range of
times since fire (3–27 years) in a much smaller geographical
area. Chambers and Mast (2005) reported that 41% of snags
on a severely burned site near Flagstaff fell by 7 years after
fire. The rate of loss of recent snags on the fire chronose-
quence reflects not only snagfall, but also conversion to other
snag decay classes. The number of fallen trees increased rap-
idly in the first years after fire, but the number of loose-bark
snags also grew rapidly through the 4- to 5-year period
(Fig. 2f).
Several of the changes in density of snag categories over
time matched the conceptual framework of Thomas et al.
(1979), who developed the snag coding system used in this
study and widely applied in western US forests. Thomas et
al. (1979) postulated that first snags are recently killed, then
the standing snags begin to lose fine branches and bark, then
bark is gone entirely (“clean” snag), and then the snag begins
to break apart. In the present study, the rapid decline in re-
cent snags and the subsequent rise in the loose-bark and bro-
ken categories followed the expected patterns, but clean
snags had low abundance with no consistent trend with time.
A separate analysis at Mt. Trumbull, Arizona, by Waskiewicz
et al. (2007) used tree-ring analysis to determine actual death
dates of snags representing all the condition classes from re-
cent through broken. They found that the longevity, or time
standing since death, of snags was highly variable but the
means did follow the time sequence suggested by Thomas et
al. (1979). The findings of the present study thus contribute
to the evidence supporting the use of snag categories as a
rough guide to time since death, which in turn allows manag-
ers to make approximations about the range in variability in
various snag categories to be expected in the first two deca-
des following severe fire. These estimates may be useful in
forecasting future wildlife habitat and carbon storage.
Fuel loads varied strongly and significantly with time since
fire, and the models illustrated in Fig. 3 may be useful for
management planning. In contrast to the findings of Passovoy
and Fulé (2006), this study found the first evidence in the US
Southwest of a pattern of CWD loadings exceeding the upper
threshold recommended by Brown et al. (2003). An earlier
study by Graham et al. (1994) recommended that between
15 and 29.5 Mg/ha of CWD be maintained in ponderosa
pine – Arizona fescue stands and that between 11 and 23
Mg/ha be maintained in ponderosa pine – Gambel oak stands
in Arizona. Brown et al. (2003) balanced CWD benefits for
wildlife habitat and productivity against potentially negative
effects of soil heating and fire hazard. They recommended
an optimal level ranging between 11.2 and 44.8 Mg/ha of
CWD in warm, dry forests (Brown et al. 2003). A maximum
level 50% higher, up to 67.2 Mg/ha, was considered suitable
for cool and lower subalpine forest types (Brown et al. 2003).
We found the peak CWD levels to be around 60 Mg/ha, oc-
curring between 6 and 12 years after fire. This was the same
time period as the peak CWD observed by Passovoy and
Fulé (2006), except that they found lower levels around 40
Mg/ha. One possible explanation for the difference is that all
of Passovoy and Fulé’s (2006) study sites were in second-
growth, managed forests, whereas two of the fire sites with
the highest CWD in the present study, Outlet 1 and Outlet 2,
were located in never-harvested forests of Grand Canyon Na-
tional Park, which tend to have larger trees (Fulé et al. 2002).
The fact that CWD loading exceeded the threshold may be a
concern in terms of potential future fire severity and could be
considered a justification for postfire logging or other fuel
treatments such as prescribed burning. However, this concern
may be counterweighed by the fact that such high levels of
CWD were not seen at the other sites. CWD loadings in fires
measured in subsequent time periods were well below the
threshold, both in this study and in that of Passovoy and
Fulé (2006).
Future forest trajectories
The burned sites in this study remained very open for as
long as 18 years, with only one of 14 sites having a basal
area higher than 4 m2/ha. In contrast, seven of 10 burned
sites studied by Savage and Mast (2005) had basal areas
higher than 4 m2/ha. A likely reason for the difference is the
greater period of time since fire in the Savage and Mast
(2005) study (fire dates 1948–1977), allowing for greater re-
growth in the burned areas as suggested by Haire and
McGarigal (2010). Savage and Mast (2005) also encountered
ponderosa pine regeneration on every burned site. Three of
10 sites had less than 25 pines/ha of regeneration (Savage
and Mast 2005), but in the present study, 50% of the sites,
and two-thirds of the sites over 5 years since fire, had no
pine regeneration at all. There was also no clear trend toward
increasing pine regeneration in the older fires.
We found evidence for the alternative stable postfire states
suggested by Savage and Mast (2005). (i) “Hyperdense” pine
regeneration was observed at one site, the 7-year-old Pine
Mountain fire. This site also had the highest pine basal area
and a relatively high proportion of fire-surviving basal area,
suggesting that the presence of seed sources was linked to
the high pine regeneration. (ii) Evidence of potential deflec-
tion to non-pine-forest conditions was observed at eight of
the 14 sites, which had no pine regeneration and minimal re-
generation by other conifers. In six of those eight sites, the
densities of overstory and understory stems of sprouting de-
ciduous species ranged from hundreds to tens of thousands
of stems per hectare. These sites showed more abundant re-

generation by deciduous species than those studied by Passo-
voy and Fulé (2006) near Flagstaff, Arizona, but the differ-
ence may be related to the unusually high dominance by
pine in the latter region with some fire sites naturally having
no or few sprouters. Although pines and other conifers may
recolonize these sites given enough time, the strong competi-
tion from dense, often shrubby, sprouting species could result
in a long-term conversion to aspen forest at higher elevations
and oak woodland at lower elevations (Barton 2002; Strom
and Fulé 2007). The other two potential deflection sites, the
Muddersbach and Pot fires, had minimal conifer or deciduous
overstory or understory, indicating the potential for conver-
sion to grassland vegetation. Sustained failure of regeneration
has been described in the Horseshoe fire in northern Arizona,
where eddy-covariance flux tower measurements show that
the postfire site remained a net carbon source over a decade
after burning (Dore et al. 2008), illustrating the fact that se-
vere fires have consequences for ecosystem services such as
carbon sequestration in the long-term. Older landscape scars
left by severe fire that caused long-term vegetation type con-
version are still observed at various sites around the US
Southwest (Haire and McGarigal 2008, 2010) but have not
been systematically studied. In contrast to Savage and Mast’s
(2005) findings, we saw evidence for possible recovery to
moderate-density pine forest or savanna at five of the 14
sites, but several also had dense deciduous trees. In sum,
compared with the findings of Savage and Mast (2005), the
present study found a smaller proportion of “hyperdense”
pine sites and somewhat higher proportions of deflected and
recovering sites. More time is needed to see whether these
patterns will remain stable, but there are substantial obstacles
to pine forest recovery: competition with sprouting species
and (or) grasses, lack of seed sources, and the forecast of
warmer, drier climatic conditions for coming decades (Seager
and Vecchi 2010). Where forest does not recover, future fuels
and fire behavior will be highly influenced by herbaceous
and shrubby plant communities that were not measured in
this study.
Management implications of the fuel loadings can be com-
plex. There are limitations in the current fire behavior model-
ing systems to making full use of CWD loadings in fuel
modeling (Passovoy and Fulé 2006), and model outputs have
considerable uncertainty (Cruz and Alexander 2010). The
thresholds for CWD management developed by Brown et al.
(2003) may be only a rough guide, especially as managers
seek to balance a variety of competing ecosystem factors
such as wildlife habitat and tree regeneration. However, the
knowledge of snag and CWD trajectories over time should
be helpful for managers to plan ahead for long-term postfire
changes. The increasing occurrence of severe fire in the
southwestern US and many other areas of the world, associ-
ated with warming climate (Seager and Vecchi 2010), means
that a rapidly growing fraction of forestlands will have post-
fire characteristics in the coming century.
