Abstract Isolated forested mountains in deserts have numerous ecological and societal
values, but land-management practices (e.g., fire-regime alteration) and climate change
can affect forest composition. We analyzed tree overstory-understory relationships on
123 sites in the Spring Mountains within the Mojave Desert near Las Vegas, Nevada,
USA to assess three hypotheses. We hypothesized that: the tree species comprising
understories are less tolerant of fire than species in overstories, reflecting land-
management practices of fire exclusion; mid-elevation forests have the lowest overstory:
understory similarity because this zone could have maximum species mixing; and
overstory:understory similarity is correlated with environmental gradients (consisting of
14 topographic and soil variables). We found that Pinus monophylla comprised greater
relative canopy cover in understories of juniper (32% relative cover) and pinyon-
juniper (78%) forests than it did in overstories of these forests (0% and 53%).
Similarly, fire-intolerant Abies concolor had 6-fold greater understory than overstory
cover in forests with overstories dominated by the fire-tolerant Pinus ponderosa.
Overstory:understory Sørensen similarity averaged 43%−77% among six forest types,
and there was little support for the supposition that similarity was lowest in mid-
elevation forests. Distributions of individual overstory and understory species more

closely corresponded with environmental gradients than did overstory:understory
similarity. Results suggest that there is high potential for change in at least two of the
six dominant forest types of the Spring Mountains. The direction of change (species of
moist, higher elevation sites establishing in understories of drier forests) is the opposite
of what would be expected for forest adaptation to the warmer, drier, more fire-prone
conditions projected for the next century in the southwestern USA.

Introduction
Understanding species distributions has long been a goal in ecology and has taken
on a new urgency for biological conservation in times of rapid land-use and climatic
change (Bässler et al. 2010). Unfortunately, a great deal of uncertainty remains about
how the distribution and abundance of species may change in response to land-
management practices (such as those that manipulate fire regimes) in a changing
climate (Millar and Brubaker 2006). In addition, there is potential that land
management and climate change could counteract or reinforce each other in
influencing species and communities. For example, management practices such as
fire suppression could intentionally, or unintentionally, create a habitat that facilitates
or hinders species movements in a changing climate (Hulme 2005). Studies that
assess potential for these relationships are rare, yet this information is important
because land management (including passive management) is occurring at the same
time the climate is changing.
Additionally, responses of species and communities to management and climate
change are not necessarily anticipated to be uniform from place to place within
landscapes (Johnson and Miller 2006). The physical landscape – in particular
topography and soils – constrains the distribution and abundance of species (Urban
et al. 2000). For example, Fulé and Laughlin (2007) found that the effects of
reintroducing fire to conifer forests of the Grand Canyon National Park, USA, varied
along elevational gradients. Higher elevation Picea/Abies/Populus sites incurred the
largest reductions in tree basal area when fire was reintroduced. Similarly, diameter
growth of Pinus longaeva (Great Basin bristlecone pine) in southwestern mountains
was greater in the second half of the 20th century than in the last 3,700 years, likely
in response to warming temperatures, but only within 150 m of treeline and not at
lower elevations (Salzer et al. 2009). These studies fortify the importance of
considering environmental gradients as key factors that could interact with land
management and climate change in affecting biological change.
Overstory-understory relationships provide a convenient framework for studying
potential for change in species and community distributions in forests. When trees
capable of attaining overstory status occur in understories, they provide a good
measure of potential future overstory composition (Oliver and Larson 1996). While
it should not automatically be assumed that there will be a 1 : 1 correspondence of
the current understory with the future overstory, as many factors (e.g., disturbance)
can influence whether species reach the overstory, projecting potential for change by
120

comparing overstories and understories is firmly established in forest ecology
(Mueller-Dombois and Ellenberg 1974).
Isolated mountain ranges within arid regions of the western USA are examples of
regions where the potential for biological change is high (e.g., due to climate
change) and conservation interest is keen. These mountains often harbor rare and
endemic species due to their isolation and unique environment, are key elements in
watershed functioning, and provide unique recreational opportunities not available in
surrounding deserts (Covington et al. 1994). One such mountain range is the Spring
Mountains of southern Nevada, located 20 km west of the city of Las Vegas (Niles
and Leary 2007). Like other mountain ranges in the western USA (e.g., Cocke et al.
2005), the Spring Mountains were subjected to a policy of fire exclusion that formed
the dominant management paradigm of the 20th century. This fire-exclusion period
corresponds with a period of climate change, to which the fire-excluded landscape
continues to be exposed (Seager et al. 2007). The Spring Mountains also contain
steep topography (slope gradients exceeding 70% in some areas), forming
substantial environmental gradients manifested in different growing conditions for
biota (Clokey 1951). These observations suggest that potential for interaction of land
management, climate change, and the physical landscape is strong, and the need for
understanding these factors is ardent given the conservation importance of isolated
forests in the Southwest (Fulé et al. 2009).
We evaluated potential for temporal forest change along environmental gradients
in the Spring Mountains by analyzing a U.S. Forest Service data set on tree
overstory-understory relationships. We hypothesized that:
i)
understories consist of tree species less tolerant of fire than overstories, given
that past management practices have attempted to exclude fire;
ii) middle-elevation forest types have the least congruence between overstories and
understories because middle elevations are potential habitat for the most species; and
iii) overstory:understory similarity varies along environmental gradients.
Methods
Study Area
The Spring Mountains, ca. 5,550 km2 in size (Niles and Leary 2007), are in the northern
Mojave Desert. Our study was conducted in the forested portion of the Spring
Mountains National Recreation Area, managed by the U.S. Forest Service and part of
the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest (Fig. 1). Forests of Juniperus spp. begin at
elevations ca. 1,800 m a.s.l., and the highest elevation in the Spring Mountains is
3,632 m a.s.l. on Charleston Peak. Major forest types include Juniperus spp. and Pinus
monophylla (single-leaf pinyon pine) at the lower elevations, followed by Pinus
ponderosa (ponderosa pine), mixed conifer, and Pinus longaeva at the highest
elevations (Niles and Leary 2007). Different forest types can, however, occur at the
same elevation depending on topography, except at the lowest and highest elevations
(Clokey 1951). Ground-layer vegetation is generally sparse and dominated by shrubs
and forbs with only scattered grasses (Fig. 2). Livestock grazing does not occur,

although wild burros and horses are present at the lower elevations. Soils are derived
primarily from limestone, dolomite, sandstone, and quartzite. The soils represent
several orders including Mollisols, Aridisols, Inceptisols, Entisols, and Alfisols
following the U.S. system (Lato 2006). The 2,048-m elevation Charkiln climate station
at a Juniperus-P. monophylla site within the study area recorded 25 cm of precipitation
with a January average daily low temperature of −3°C and a July average daily high
temperature of 30°C during 2009, the first complete year of records (NWCC 2010). At
a higher elevation climate station (Lee Canyon), 2,605 m in elevation at a P. ponderosa
site, the following data were reported for 2009: 58 cm of precipitation, a January daily
low temperature of −4°C, and a July daily high temperature of 23°C.
Data and Measurements
We used an existing U.S. Forest Service data set on forest structure collected at 123
Terrestrial Ecological Unit Inventory (TEUI) sites distributed throughout the

mountain range (Fig. 1). Sites spanned an elevation gradient of 1,477 to 3,386 m, were
approximately proportionally distributed by forest type, and contained a total of seven
tree species (Tables 1 and 2). Based on fire records kept by the Forest Service since
1920 (Spring Mountains National Recreation Area, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA), none of
the study sites experienced recorded fires since 1920 except possibly for small areas of
ignitions with minimal spread (such as lightning strikes of individual trees). At each
site, a soil pit was excavated and described by soil scientists following standard soil
survey procedures of the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (Soil Survey
Staff 1993). Slope gradient was recorded using a clinometer, aspect using a compass,
and elevation using a global positioning system.
Tree measurements followed standard procedures for the TEUI (Winthers et al.
2005). On a 20 m × 20 m (0.04 ha) plot at each site, five transects (each 20 m long)
were established 5 m apart within the plot. Areal tree canopy cover was categorized
using a densitometer (Geographic Resource Solutions, Arcata, California, USA) at
1-m intervals along transects by tree strata as trace (assigned 0.1%) and at 1%
intervals from 1–100%. Cover of the same species could not overlap within strata
but could overlap among strata and species. The cover data were used as a measure
of dominance (Mueller-Dombois and Ellenberg 1974; Gill et al. 2000). Crown
architecture varied across species, but was more similar for species that co-occurred
on the same sites and hence were directly compared in dominance using canopy

Tolerances are on a relative basis among species and are based on comparing information in the U.S.
Forest Service Fire Effects Information System (http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/), Burns and Honkala
(1990), and NRCS (2010). Pinus ponderosa was classified with a low-medium shade tolerance because its
regeneration does have the ability to grow below its overstories. Species with low-medium fire tolerance
are intolerant of fire when young but gain some ability to survive low-severity surface fire when older.

comparable stem diameter (Gill et al. 2000). Strata were defined in the TEUI as:
overstory with tree heights ≥5 m, and understory with trees <5 m in height. All tree
species in understories included in the analysis were potential overstory trees able to
attain overstory status (Table 2). Cercocarpus ledifolius (mountain mahogany) and
Quercus gambelii (Gambel oak) were the principal understory species not analyzed
as potential overstory trees. Data were collected from 2004–2006. Nomenclature
follows NRCS (2010).
In 2009 at six sites, we collected new data (cores at 1.4 m of 87 Abies concolor
and 38 Pinus ponderosa) for the purpose of evaluating whether the differentiation of
understory and overstory strata in the TEUI classification could be related to tree
age. The data supported a supposition that the understory trees were younger than
the overstory trees. For example, at one site the six overstory P. ponderosa ranged in
age (at a height of 1.4 m) from 127–224 years, whereas 22 of 23 (96%) A. concolor
were in the understory and all were <103 years in age (the remaining stem was a
189-year-old overstory tree). At another site, four overstory P. ponderosa ranged in
age from 235–417 years, none of the nine understory P. ponderosa exceeded
122 years, and the nine understory A. concolor were younger than age 89 years.
Data Analysis
We analyzed overstory-understory compositional relationships among forest types,
by individual species, and with environmental variables. By tree strata, we calculated
relative cover for each species on each plot as: (cover of target species/cover of all
species) × 100. We classified plots by overstory forest type using the following
criteria: juniper forests: all sites with 100% overstory relative cover of Juniperus
spp., pinyon-juniper: both Pinus monophylla and Juniperus spp. present in the
overstory, pinyon: all sites with 100% relative cover of P. monophylla, ponderosa:
>70% relative cover of Pinus ponderosa, mixed conifer: no consistent canopy
dominant and sites not classified into the other forest types, and bristlecone: >85%
relative cover of Pinus longaeva. These criteria were based on the observed data:
juniper, pinyon-juniper, and pinyon forests were classified based on the simple
presence/absence of the criterion; all but one of the eight ponderosa sites had >88%
relative cover of Pinus ponderosa (the remaining site had 71% cover); and six of
seven bristlecone sites had 100% relative cover of P. longaeva (the remaining site
had 87%). When no trees were present (which only occurred for understories, on 11
sites), we created a ‘none’ variable assigned 100% relative cover for analyses.
We compared overstory and understory species composition (based on relative cover)
among forest types using multi-response permutation procedures in PC-ORD software
(McCune and Mefford 1999). This nonparametric analysis tests the multivariate
hypothesis of no difference between two or more groups (Zimmerman et al. 1985). We
used the Sørensen index, the n/sum(n) recommended group weighting, and Bonferroni
corrections (for 15 pairwise multiple comparisons) to maintain a P-value cutoff of 0.05
for declaring significance in multiple comparisons. We compared overstory:understory
similarity (quantitative Sørensen index) among forest types using a one-way analysis
of variance (α=0.05) in JMP software (SAS Institute 2004). Since the equal variance
assumption was violated (Levene’s Test, F5,117=4.69, P=0.0006), we performed
Welch’s analysis of variance allowing for unequal variances (SAS Institute 2004). To
Gradients in Overstory-Understory Relationships
125

examine changes in individual species, we calculated a ratio of understory:overstory
relative cover. We then used a χ2 test (PROC FREQ) with pairwise comparisons
(PROC GENMOD), Bonferroni adjusted (α=0.05; PROC MULTTEST), in SAS
software (SAS Institute 1999) to compare the proportion of sites on which understory
relative cover exceeded overstory cover for each species.
The environmental data set consisted of thickness, texture, and pH of the A and B
horizons, total soil depth to a root-restricting layer, elevation, slope gradient, aspect
(transformed to range from 0 (southwest, 225°) to 2 (northeast, 45°) following Beers
et al. (1966)), and heat load. We calculated heat load using non-parametric
multiplicative regression in the software Hyperniche (McCune and Mefford 2004)
following methods in McCune (2007).
We assessed relationships of environmental variables and the relative cover of
overstory and understory trees and overstory:understory similarity using a regression
tree analysis in JMP software (SAS Institute 2004). Regression trees are nonparametric
models that partition data into increasingly homogenous subsets and provide
dichotomous keys to estimate a dependent variable at different levels of explanatory
variables (Breiman et al. 1984). The JMP version allows users to determine the
number of splits, so we stopped splitting when adding more explanatory variables
increased r2 by <0.05 or when the minimum node size (n=5) was reached. We
employed JMP’s k-fold crossvalidation (k=5) to compute a cross-validated r2
(1 – (crossvalidated sum of squares error / corrected sum of squares)). Because the
explanatory ability of the regression tree was low for overstory:understory similarity,
we also used non-parametric multiplicative regression (free search for the best model
using local mean and Gaussian weighting function and default settings) to estimate
similarity as a function of the environmental variables in Hyperniche software
(McCune and Mefford 2004). Non-parametric multiplicative regression does not
require a priori assumptions about the model form, estimates the response variable
from a multiplicative combination of all potential predictors, and produces a cross-
validated r2 as a measure of model strength (McCune 2006).
Using principal components analysis in PC-ORD, we summarized variation in the
environmental data set and derived principal components significant at P<0.05
based on comparing observed eigenvalues to randomizations. This analysis produces
components uncorrelated with each other and can be useful for extracting gradients
in environmental data sets that represent combinations of interacting variables
(McGarigal et al. 2000). We then examined bivariate correlations between overstory:
understory similarity, the principal components, and individual environmental
variables using Pearson and Spearman rank coefficients.
Results
Forest types were classified based on overstory species composition, which was
reinforced by a finding that each forest type exhibited significantly different overstory
composition (multi-response permutation procedures, A-statistic = 0.61, P<0.0001;
Table 1). Understory tree composition also differed overall among forest types
(A-statistic = 0.34, P<0.0001), although not every forest type was uniquely different in
multiple comparisons. Pinyon forests did not differ from juniper or pinyon-juniper
126

forests, and ponderosa and mixed conifer forests also did not differ from each other. In
comparing overstory:understory similarity among forest types, no difference was
detected in Welch’s analysis of variance (F5,22=1.01, P=0.4367). Mean similarity varied
almost two-fold among forest types, being least in juniper and most in pinyon forests,
but standard deviations exceeded or were nearly equal to means in several types.
Juniper forests exhibited exclusive overstory dominance by Juniperus osteosperma
(Utah juniper), while this species constituted less than half of understory relative cover
with the remainder being Pinus monophylla (Fig. 3). Similarly, J. osteosperma and P.
monophylla shared dominance in overstories of pinyon-juniper forests, but P. mono-
phylla had six times the cover of J. osteosperma in the understory. Pinus monophylla
exclusively dominated overstories in pinyon forests and maintained dominance in
understories. In ponderosa forests, Pinus ponderosa attained a relative cover in
understories less than half of its cover in overstories, while Abies concolor comprised
over 50% of understory cover. Mixed conifer forests overall had similar overstory and
understory composition, both with high amounts of A. concolor. Except for small
amounts of A. concolor and other species, understories in bristlecone forests were
dominated by Pinus longaeva, although several sites had no regeneration of any species.
Species and strata interacted statistically (χ2=59.84, P<0.0001), indicating that the
proportion of sites where understory relative cover exceeded overstory cover for a
species was more than expected by random chance. Juniperus osteosperma and Pinus
ponderosa had significantly fewer sites where understory cover exceeded overstory
cover (implying declines in abundance), whereas Pinus monophylla had significantly
more sites where understory cover exceeded its overstory cover (Fig. 4).
Based on a regression tree analysis, associations of environmental variables with
relative cover differed among species and overstory or understory status within
species (Table 3). Cross-validated regression trees, using 2–4 environmental
variables, explained between 38% (Pinus monophylla and Pinus ponderosa) and
Fig. 3 Relative canopy cover by forest type (top of bars) and overstory (O) and understory (U) strata in
the Spring Mountains, southern Nevada, USA

72% (Juniperus osteosperma) of the variation in the relative cover of overstory trees.
For understory trees, 18% (P. ponderosa) to 45% (Abies concolor) of the variation
was explained also using 2–4 environmental variables. Elevation was important in
all of the species models, with various other variables, such as aspect for overstory
Abies concolor, forming secondary divisions.
The cross-validated r2 for modeling overstory:understory similarity was lower
than for the species regression trees (Table 3). Additionally, none of the best 1–5
variable models in non-parametric multiplicative regression exhibited a cross-
validated r2 above 0.06.
In the principal components and correlational analysis, the first four components
accounted for 69% of the variance in the environmental data set (Table 4).
Component 1 had higher positive loadings for silt, elevation, and slope gradient,
while pH and aspect primarily characterized component 2. A-horizon sand
represented component 3, while heat load typified component 4. However,
overstory:understory similarity did not exhibit a correlation coefficient (Pearson or
Spearman r) |0.18| with any component or individual environmental variable.
Discussion
Support for Hypotheses
Fire-Intolerant Species Dominate Understories
Two of the most dominant species in understories were Pinus monophylla and Abies
concolor, both considered fire intolerant (Table 2). There is uncertainty about
historical fire regimes prior to Euro-American settlement beginning in the late 1800s
in the juniper, pinyon-juniper, and pinyon forest types where P. monophylla is
currently the dominant understory constituent. Trees in these forest types do not
form fire scars as readily as Pinus ponderosa, making it difficult to detect surface fire
regimes (Huffman et al. 2008). Furthermore, current thinking postulates that surface,

stand-replacing, and mixed (both types) fire regimes may all have occurred in these
forests, contingent upon many factors including site productivity, fuel loads,
topography, and climate (Huffman et al. 2008). There are no published fire histories
in the Spring Mountains, and such information would be useful for placing the tree
regeneration patterns in context. For example, is the current dominance of P.
monophylla in understories the result of a natural cycle where P. monophylla
increases in free-periods in a natural stand-replacing or mixed fire regime, or the

Species, on the left side of the table, are abbreviated as the first three letters of the genus and species
(Table 1). Only species that occupied ≥15% of the 123 sites were modeled (Fig. 4). Each model reads as a
dichotomous key, where estimated values of relative % canopy cover (or % similarity for the overstory-
understory relationship at the bottom of the table) are given as mean ± s.d. Numbers in brackets signal a
division, with the divisions numbered sequentially and shown in bold. Numbers in parentheses indicate
how many sites are at a terminal node. For example, for overstory JUNOST, if elevation is ≥2,304 m a.s.l.,
then the estimated relative cover of JUNOST is 4±9%. If elevation is <2,304 m a.s.l., then proceed to the
second division. Units for environmental variables are as follows: aspect – transformed following Beers et
al. (1966) ranging from 0 (southwest) to 2 (northeast), clay and silt – %, elevation – meters, heat – heat
loading following McCune (2007), restrict – depth in cm to a root-restricting layer, and SG – slope
gradient in %. Soil horizons are given as A or B. Cumulative r2 values are given sequentially for each
division and as a whole-model, cross-validated r2 .

result of disrupting a frequent-fire regime that has enabled the fire-intolerant P.
monophylla to become established? Alternatively, climatic fluctuations or other
factors could also be associated with P. monophylla dominance in understories. Pinus
monophylla occupies understories but not overstories of juniper forests, which are
lower in elevation and drier than forests where P. monophylla presently occupies
overstories. It is possible that P. monophylla is regenerating in forests where it may
not be well adapted as an overstory tree if the climate becomes warmer and drier as
projected for the southwestern USA (Seager et al. 2007).
The large amount of Abies concolor in understories below Pinus ponderosa
overstories is consistent with the hypothesis that fire-intolerant species have increased
during fire exclusion of the past century. Abies concolor is considered fire intolerant
especially when young, whereas P. ponderosa is regarded as one of the most fire-tolerant
conifers in the western USA (Burns and Honkala 1990). While no fire history studies
reconstructing fire regimes prior to the exclusion period have been published specifically
in the Spring Mountains, a large amount of research in the Southwest has shown that fire
return intervals (prior to exclusion) were generally ≤10 years in P. ponderosa or mixed
conifer forests containing P. ponderosa. For example, no fire intervals exceeded 26 years
(based on fires recorded by any tree within sites) in Swetnam and Baisan’s (1996)
compilation of 63 fire-scar chronologies. Observations of fire scars on P. ponderosa
specifically in the Spring Mountains suggest that fire also was prevalent historically in
these forests. We observed that fire scars were present on one or more mature P.
ponderosa on more than half of the sites (within an area ca. 0.5 ha) in ponderosa forests

(S.R. Abella, unpubl. data). Based on the process of fire-scar formation (Gutsell and
Johnson 1996), this suggests that these trees recorded multiple surface fires prior to the
fire-exclusion period. Abies concolor also is less drought-tolerant than P. ponderosa and
can dominate sites higher in elevation or moister than P. ponderosa. Similar to Pinus
monophylla in juniper forests, A. concolor is growing below a more drought-resistant
overstory, raising questions about the adaptability of the possible future forest during
climate change (e.g., Cocke et al. 2005; Fulé et al. 2009).
Several other studies have reported increases in Abies concolor during the 1900s
or dominance of the species below overstories of other species. For example, A.
concolor has increased in Tahoe Basin mixed conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada
Mountains of California (Barbour et al. 2002), Pinus ponderosa forests of the North
Rim of the Grand Canyon in Arizona (Merkle 1962), and mixed conifer forests of
the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado (Fulé et al. 2009). Results from
the Spring Mountains provide further evidence supporting the observation that A.
concolor abundance in understories is widespread geographically in western forests,
although in the Spring Mountains a large overstory:understory imbalance occurred
mainly in ponderosa forests and not in mixed conifer forests (Fig. 3).
Lowest Overstory: Understory Similarity in Middle Elevations
The data did not reveal unequivocal evidence that mid-elevation forest types (pinyon
and ponderosa) had the least congruence between overstories and understories
(Table 1). Overstory:understory similarity did not differ significantly among forest
types, and the mid-elevation pinyon forest had the highest mean similarity by 18%
over the next highest forest type. Mid-elevation ponderosa forests did have among
the lowest similarity and more Abies concolor than Pinus ponderosa in understories,
but the lowest similarity of 43% occurred in the lowest elevation forest type
(juniper). Furthermore, we hypothesized that mid-elevation forests might have the
lowest similarity because more species theoretically could co-exist and colonize
understories at middle elevations than were existing in the mature overstories.
However, neither mid-elevation forest did actually contain the most species, as
higher elevation mixed conifer forests had the most with five species (Fig. 3).
Environmental Specificity of Overstory-Understory Relations
Environmental variables were more closely associated with distributions of species than
with community-level overstory:understory similarity (Table 3). Neither the regression
tree nor the non-parametric multiplicative regression models explained more than 16%
of the variance in similarity using environmental variables. In re-examining the raw
data, we calculated correlation coefficients of overstory:understory similarity with
environmental variables within forest types and assessed site-specific data. The
relationship of similarity with environmental variables in this type of analysis was also
not clearly discernable either. For example, within the pinyon-juniper forest type, no
environmental variable exhibited an r2 (Pearson coefficient) >0.07 with similarity. In
ponderosa forests, sites with transformed aspects (Beers et al. 1966) from 0 to 0.3 (dry
southerly and westerly slopes) varied from 0% similarity (with 100% understory
relative cover of Abies concolor) to 98% similarity (with 100% understory cover of

Pinus ponderosa). This suggests that a given aspect could support dominance of either
A. concolor or P. ponderosa in the understory and a range of overstory:understory
similarities. Trends were similar for elevation and other environmental variables.
However, our findings pertain to a sampling design of measuring plots distributed
across the landscape. A paired-site or toposequence sampling design could have
produced different results. For instance, paired north- and south-facing slopes could be
sampled within the same drainage to possibly more closely isolate environmental
influences on tree establishment. This may also allow environmental influences to be
disentangled from other factors that could influence overstory-understory relationships,
such as seed dispersal processes (Hille Ris Lambers and Clark 2003). In the case of
ponderosa forests in the present study, for instance, the southerly aspects that
supported either Abies concolor or Pinus ponderosa understories could hinge upon
whether the sites are near A. concolor seed sources.
Conservation Implications
After observing increases in Abies and other moist-affinity species in northern
Arizona and southwestern Colorado ponderosa and mixed conifer forests, similar
to what this study found in the Spring Mountains, Cocke et al. (2005) and Fulé et
al. (2009) noted that the expansion of moist species into drier forests is the
opposite of what would be expected for forest adaptability to future climate change
scenarios. The Southwest is projected to become warmer, drier, and more
susceptible to fire (e.g., due to earlier snow melts and longer fire seasons; Seager
et al. 2007). Fulé et al. (2009) also noted that moist-affinity conifer forests such as
those dominated by Abies concolor can accumulate more fuel, including ladder
fuels, and are less fire-resistant than ponderosa forests. Thus, tradeoffs are
anticipated if ponderosa forests are replaced by A. concolor forests, as overstory-
understory relationships suggest.
Several approaches could be available for forest management in the Spring
Mountains. First, passive management (no action) could be employed. Under this
scenario, future forest composition in juniper and ponderosa forests likely depends
on the abilities of moist-affinity, fire-intolerant species (Pinus monophylla and Abies
concolor) to attain overstory status in drier forests than their overstory trees presently
occupy. Because current overstory species in these two forest types are sparse in
understories, there would be a lag time before these trees could attain overstory
status even if the species began regenerating now. Passive management may largely
maintain the status quo of species composition in pinyon, mixed conifer, and
bristlecone forests, assuming that current understories attain overstory status and
continue regenerating. Second, active management could be attempted to maintain
Juniperus spp. and Pinus ponderosa in their forest types. Selective thinning of other
species, or prescribed or wildland fire use (Fulé and Laughlin 2007), could be
attempted to adjust species composition based on overstory-understory relationships.
Third, additional management approaches could be tested for their feasibility in
helping forests cope with climate change. More drastic activities could include
attempting to facilitate establishment of species with warmer and drier affinities on
higher and currently moister sites in anticipation of climate change influences
(Hulme 2005). The appropriateness and feasibility of these activities are generally
132
S.R. Abella et al.

considered debatable among ecologists (e.g., Seastedt et al. 2008). Ultimately, a
useful framework for selecting management strategies could result from evaluating
which possible forests provide the best functions for maintaining the numerous rare
species of the Spring Mountains (Niles and Leary 2007), are the least susceptible to
unnatural catastrophic fires, and are the most adaptable to climate change.
