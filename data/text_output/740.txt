ERI and Broad-Scale Monitoring
Federal law requires each national forest to have a Land and Resource
Management Plan. These plans are the foundation and guide for all
management activities on the national forest. In 2012, the U.S. Forest Service
(USFS) issued a revised Planning Rule after two years of development and
external review. There are many changes from the 1982 planning rule,
including additional monitoring requirements that direct “the development of a
broader-scale monitoring strategy for plan monitoring questions that can best
be answered at a geographic scale broader than one plan area.” The
Ecological Restoration Institute, in partnership with USFS Regions 2 and 3 and
our sister institutes (CFRI and NMFWRI) developed a proposal to create an
effective multi-scaled monitoring strategy.
 
This project is designed to both develop the framework for a broad-scale

monitoring strategy, engage external participation, and identify the key
questions, indicators, and associated parameters for a pilot area within USFS
Regions 2 and 3. A USFS and academic project team assessed existing
monitoring plans and conducted interviews with key experts in multiple federal
and state agencies and non-government organizations to asses existing
broader-scale monitoring successes and lessons-learned. A series of
workshops will be conducted in 2016 to contribute to a broader-scale
monitoring plan framework. For more information, visit the SW Ecological
Restoration Institute website’s Broad-Scale Monitoring page.

A team of researchers compared restoration treatments in a warm/dry mixed-
conifer forest in southwestern Colorado to determine which treatment is most
effective in maintaining forest structure, function, and resiliency. Results
suggest that full restoration increases a forest’s ability to withstand
disturbances like drought, insect infestation, and high-severity ﬁre in the face of
a changing climate.

Research and Development – 2015 Summer Field Season Data
Collection 
By Walker Chancellor, Research Specialist
Flagstaff Watershed Protection Project (FWPP)
The goal of this project is to understand how restoration treatments may or may
not affect Mexican spotted owl (MSO) habitat in Protected Activity Centers
(PACs) in mixed conifer forests on roughly 11,000 acres around Dry Lake Hills
and Mormon Mountain. This project is a partnership between the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service (USFWS), City of Flagstaff, and U.S. Forest Service. The
USFWS will monitor owl responses while ERI measures vegetation changes.
 
Managed Wildﬁre Project 
The goal of this project is to quantify structural attributes at ﬁne, mid, and
landscape scales within wildﬁres managed for resource beneﬁt, i.e., ﬁres
managed for multiple objectives including fuel reduction, maintaining ﬁre in a
ﬁre-adapted ecosystem, increasing ﬁreﬁghter and public safety, and protecting
cultural resources and wildlife habitat, in ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer
forests. This research will provide much needed information concerning
efﬁcacy of wildﬁre for meeting desired conditions and natural ranges of
variability in forest structure. Information gained in this study will be valuable to
regional land managers, who seek to understand potential outcomes of various
restoration strategies and weigh tradeoffs between these strategies for meeting
hazardous fuels and restoration goals.
 
Managed Wildﬁre Project (North Rim, GCNP) 
The goal of this project is to evaluate long-term changes in wildﬁres managed
for resource beneﬁt. By remeasuring permanent ﬁeld plots, we will quantify
changes in forest structure and understory communities within wildﬁres that
burned more than 10 years ago in Grand Canyon National Park. This
information will be available to assist planning for ﬁre and resource managers.
 
Mineral LEARN (Long-term Ecological Assessment and Restoration
Network)
In June, 2014 the San Juan wildﬁre burned into the Mineral Ecosystem
Management Area, where the ERI has an established study to compare long-

Page	  9	  of	  12
term ecological responses to alternative restoration treatments. The ﬁre burned
untreated, burn-only, and thin and burn units. The ERI took this opportunity to
document and compare ﬁre effects in the different treatments.
 
Outreach Support
Projects supported by ﬁeld staff for the Agency Outreach team included the
Escudilla and Rio Tusas Restoration Projects. Rapid assessment plots were
established in these locations to determine the natural range of variability in
these areas. This information will be used to inform management actions.
 
Agency Outreach
By Bruce Greco, Director of Agency Outreach
During this year’s ﬁeld season, the ERI Agency Outreach team collected and
analyzed data for several key USFS projects in the Southwestern Region. The
team also provided science support to the USFS for restoration planning,
implementation, and Forest Land Management Plan Revisions. A few highlights
include:
West Escudilla Restoration Project – Springerville/Alpine Ranger District,
Apache-Sitgreaves NF: ERI continued to coordinate with the forest to provide
the ﬁeld data we collected through a rapid assessment process on a ~64,000-
acre restoration project. A speciﬁc component is the identiﬁcation of historic
pinyon-juniper woodland and grassland areas.
 
Rio Tusus-San Antonio Restoration Project – ERI is collecting data and
providing science support for a ponderosa pine/dry mixed-conifer restoration
project (100,000+ acres) on the Tres Piedras Ranger District, Carson NF. This

Page	  10	  of	  12
summer, Agency Outreach completed a rapid assessment for the conifer
vegetation and is preparing a summary report. Additionally, we established a
40-acre “evidence-based mark” demonstration area.
 
Mixed-Conifer LEARN Study Plots – Mogollon Rim Ranger District, Coconino
NF: Together with ERI’s Research and Development group, staff continue to
facilitate the implementation of a long-term study that will provide information
about treatment alternatives in mixed-conifer ecosystems. 
 
Tonto NF Forest Plan Revision – We continue to assist the Tonto Forest Plan
Revision by contributing science support, providing ﬁeld-based information on
ecological restoration concepts, and developing a historical overview of
forested ecosystems on the Tonto NF based on existing literature.
 
4FRI Rim Country Analysis – Apache-Sitgreaves, Coconino and Tonto NF’s:
ERI continues to provide science and administrative support through the
collaborative process. We are participating in the newly formed Planning
Working Group and are exploring additional rapid assessment projects in the
4FRI area.
 
Hopi Nation Support – The Agency Outreach team is assisting the Hopi tribe’s
Department of Natural Resources to develop strategies to complete their Forest
Management Plan for tribal lands. This effort will include support to provide
best available science that will help inform their planning and analysis.
