Montane forests across western North Amer -
ica have become increasingly dense over the
last century due to a variety of factors, including
grazing, logging, suppression of frequent fires,
and climatic events favoring conifer regenera-
tion (Allen et al. 2002). Efforts to restore these
ecosystems often involve thinning small-diame-
ter trees and reintroducing fire. In some cases,
however, tree thinning is very difficult, espe-
cially in national parks, where the felling of
trees with chainsaws is kept to a minimum. In
these cases, fire is the best tool available to
forest managers interested in restoring histori -
cal fire regimes and forest structure over broad
spatial scales. Multiple prescribed fires are often
needed to achieve long-term management ob -
jectives, but little information is available to
managers about the effects of second-entry
burns in mixed conifer forests.
Fulé et al. (2004) assessed whether relatively
intense burning could be used to restore the
historical fire regime and forest structure in a
mixed conifer forest in Grand Canyon National
Park (GCNP), Arizona. In 1993, a prescribed
fire in a dense forest in GCNP escaped pre-
scription and burned with greater intensity and
severity than anticipated (although the fire re -
mained within the proposed boundaries). The
fire reduced average tree density to 331 trees ⋅
ha–1 and basal area to 29 m2 ⋅ha–1 (compared

EFFECTS OF A SECOND-ENTRY PRESCRIBED 
FIRE IN A MIXED CONIFER FOREST
Daniel C. Laughlin1, John Paul Roccaforte2, and Peter Z. Fulé3
ABSTRACT.—We analyzed the effects of a second-entry prescribed fire in a mixed conifer forest in Grand Canyon National
Park, Arizona, 14 years after the initial burn to assess whether restoration and management objectives were achieved. The
surface fire had little effect on large overstory ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, and white fir trees and did not change total tree
density or basal area. The fire reduced the overall density of conifer seedlings <30 cm tall by 87%, but had a smaller effect
on seedlings >30 cm tall and on sapling density. The fire reduced litter depths by 33%, duff depths by 23%, fine woody debris
by 21%, and coarse woody debris by 44%. These effects were mostly consistent with restoration goals in mixed conifer
forests and continue to move this forest toward reference conditions. Grand Canyon National Park staff now considers
this forest to be in “maintenance burning,” meaning that they plan to allow natural ignitions to maintain forest structure in
the future. This forest is now more resilient to projected increases in fire size and/or frequency under conditions of a warming
climate. This example illustrates that use of prescribed fire in a ponderosa pine–dominated mixed conifer forest can be consis-
tent both with restoring historical conditions and with managing for resilience under altered disturbance regimes accom-
panying a changing climate.
RESUMEN.—Analizamos los efectos de una quema prescrita que se realizó por segunda vez 14 años después de la quema
inicial en un bosque templado de coníferas en el Parque Nacional del Gran Cañón en Arizona, para evaluar si las metas de
restauración y manejo se lograron. El incendio en la superficie casi no afectó los pinos ponderosa de alto dosel, los abetos
de Douglas ni los abetos del Colorado, y no cambió la densidad total de árboles o el área basal. El fuego redujo en un 87%
la densidad total de las plántulas de coníferas de <30 cm de altura, pero tuvo un impacto menor en las plántulas de >30 cm
de altura y en la densidad de los árboles jóvenes. El fuego redujo en un 33% la profundidad de la hojarasca, en un 23% la
profundidad de la capa de fermentación, en un 21% el detritus leñoso fino y el grueso en un 44%. Estos efectos fueron
en su mayoría consistentes con las metas de restauración para los bosques mixtos de coníferas y continúan impulsando
este bosque hacia sus condiciones de referencia. Ahora, el personal del Parque Nacional del Gran Cañón considera que este
bosque está en “quemas de mantenimiento”, queriendo decir con esto que planean permitir incendios naturales para man-
tener la estructura forestal en el futuro. En este momento, este bosque se encuentra más fuerte para resistir los aumentos
proyectados en la magnitud y frecuencia de los incendios derivados de condiciones climáticas que serán más calurosas. Este
ejemplo ilustra que el uso de la quema prescrita en un bosque mixto de coníferas dominado por pinos ponderosa puede ser
consistente tanto con la restauración de las condiciones históricas como con el manejo para la resistencia a regímenes de
perturbaciones alteradas por el cambio climático.

to similar unburned forest with a density of
940 trees ⋅ha–1 and basal area of 41 m2 ⋅ha–1),
values which are similar to pre-European refer-
ence conditions (approximately 246 trees ⋅ha–1
and 29 m2 ⋅ha–1; Fulé et al. 2004). Mortality
was concentrated in fire-susceptible species,
especially white fir, restoring dominance by
fire-resistant ponderosa pine. The native herba-
ceous understory also responded positively to
this intense fire (Huisinga et al. 2005). Fulé et
al. (2004) concluded that, although the inten-
tional use of severe burning is challenging to
managers because of the increased risk of
escaped fires, the ecological outcome of this
fire was consistent with ecological restoration
goals for mixed conifer forests.
Managers at Grand Canyon National Park
have continued to utilize fire, mimicking natural
fire events in frequent-fire forests, to restore
historical forest structure and processes. In
2007, GCNP fire staff reburned the same mixed
conifer forest stand that burned in 1993. The
overall goal of the second-entry fire was to main-
tain old-growth forest structure so that the for -
est could tolerate low-intensity surface fires.
Specific management objectives included (1)
minimizing mortality of large trees, (2) main-
taining low seedling and sapling densities, and
(3) further reducing surface fuel loadings. In
this note, we assess whether this second-entry
prescribed fire resulted in meeting these 3
objectives. An objective was considered to be
successfully met if (1) densities of large trees
were not signi ficantly reduced, (2) seedling and
sapling densities were significantly reduced,
and (3) fuel loads were significantly reduced.
This study was conducted in a mixed coni -
fer forest on Swamp Ridge, Kaibab Plateau, in
northern Arizona (36°20N, 112°15W). Domi -
nant tree species in the forest included pon-
derosa pine (Pinus ponderosa C. Lawson), white
fir (Abies concolor [Gord. & Glend.] Lindl. ex
Hildebr.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii
[Mirb.] Franco), Engelmann spruce (Picea engel -
mannii Parry ex Engelm.), and quaking aspen
(Populus tremuloides Michx.). Elevation ranged
from 2427 m to 2549 m. Long-term average
an nual precipitation at the North Rim ranger
sta tion (elevation 2564 m) is 65 cm; average
annual snowfall is 356 cm. Temperatures range
from an average July maximum of 25 °C to
an average January minimum of –8 °C (West-
ern Regional Climate Center, http://www.wrcc
.dri.edu).
Before 1879, the fire regime in this forest
was one of frequent surface fires, often cover-
ing large areas. The Weibull median probabil-
ity interval between surface fires was 8.7 years
for fires scarring 25% or more of fire-scarred
sample trees (Fulé et al. 2003). After the 1879
fire, no large fire was recorded on the site (Fulé
et al. 2003). The elimination of surface fires
after 1879 was most likely the result of (1) heavy
grazing by domestic livestock introduced by
European settlers (Altschul and Fairley 1989),
which removed herbaceous fuels, and (2) fire
suppression policies when the area was set aside
as a reserve in 1893 and then a national park in
1919 (Fulé et al. 2003).
Previously described by Fulé et al. (2004), a
490-ha unit called “Northwest 3” was ignited by
Grand Canyon National Park staff in 1993 in this
mixed conifer forest (Fig. 1). This same unit
was burned again using prescribed fire from 8
to 11 November 2007. Strip head and backing
fires were hand-ignited with drip torches on
the perimeter of the unit, and the interior was
burned via aerial ignitions. Weather was con-
ducive to moderate burning: skies were partly
cloudy, winds were light from the southwest,
relative humidity ranged from 21% to 49%, and
maximum air temperatures ranged from 10 to
15 °C. Fuel moistures ranged between 4% and
20% across all size classes. Flame lengths aver-
aged 3–15 cm in needle fuels and 90 cm in
grass fuels, with flames creeping up the bark to
heights of 6 m in live, mature pines and firs.
Isolated group and single-tree torching was
observed occasionally, and standing snags and
coarse fuels burned actively into the nights.
We remeasured all thirty 0.1-ha plots from
20 to 25 June 2008 to assess fire effects. We
recorded (1) species, condition (live or snag), and
diameter at breast height (dbh) of all trees
>15 cm dbh on the entire plot and on all trees
between 2.5 cm and 15 cm dbh on a 250-m2
subplot; (2) seedling (trees <2.5 cm dbh) den-
sities of all species on a 50-m2 subplot; and (3)
fuel loadings on four 15.24-m planar intersect
transects placed in random directions every
10 m along the plot centerline. Litter (unde-
composed material) and duff (decomposing ma -
terial or humus) depths were measured every
1.52 m along each transect. Woody debris was
recorded by timelag/size classes, where time-
lag refers to the average time needed for the
debris to come into equilibrium with atmos-
pheric moisture content. Fine woody debris

(FWD) consisted of the sum of 1-hour (woody
fuels >0 cm and <0.64 cm in diameter), 10-hour
(0.64–2.54 cm), and 100-hour (2.54–7.62 cm)
fuels. Coarse woody debris (CWD) consisted of
the sum of both sound and rotten woody debris
>7.62 cm in diameter. A more detailed account
of plot-sampling methods can be found in Fulé
et al. (2004).
We analyzed fire effects as a before-after
study design (van Mantgem et al. 2001) by sub-
tracting data collected 8 years before the recent
fire (1999) from data collected immediately fol-
lowing the fire (2008). Thus, changes between
1999 and 2008 reflect net changes of forest
growth plus ingrowth of new trees minus natu -
ral and fire-induced mortality. Natural (e.g.,
drought-induced) mortality was likely 6%–11%
of the mortality in this stand, based on evi-
dence from nearby stands (Fulé and Laughlin
2007). We acknowledge that these data may
underestimate fire-induced mortality because we
remeasured stands only one year after the fire.
Given evidence from nearby sites, it is possible
to observe an additional 5%–30% more mortality,
depending on size class and species (Fulé and
Laughlin 2007). However, delayed mortality is
likely low in this forest due to the high crown
base heights resulting from the pre vious burn.
Unfortunately, resources for remeasurement 2
years after the fire were unavailable. The calcu-
lated differences were analyzed with a Wil -
coxon’s signed-ranks test (a nonparametric alterna-
tive to the paired t test) to determine whether
these changes were significantly different than
zero. Fulé et al. (2004) were able to compare
fire effects in the Northwest 3 unit to a nearby
unburned control, but we could not remeasure
this site to use as a control since it was burned
by a wildland fire in 2003. Nevertheless, we
report stand structural attributes of this control

area in 1999 in Table 1 to give an impression
of how the 2 prescribed fires in the Northwest
3 unit have restored overall forest structure.
The prescribed fire had minimal impact on
the overstory (Table 1, Fig. 1). Large (>40 cm
dbh) ponderosa pine tree mortality was limited
to a nonsignificant 8% reduction. Large Doug -
las-fir and white fir trees survived the fire.
Total overstory basal area (P = 0.20) and den-
sity (P = 0.43) did not greatly change. Ponderosa
pine densities (inclusive of all size classes) de -
clined significantly from 136 to 125 trees ⋅ha–1
(P = 0.01), but pine basal area was not signifi-
cantly reduced (P = 0.71), indicating that mor-
tality was more pronounced in smaller-diameter
pines. No other species exhibited significant
changes in basal area or density. These results
were consistent with GCNP’s management ob -
jectives to retain large trees (Table 1).
Our assessment of tree mortality was con-
ducted one year after the fire, but sometimes
mortality is delayed following fire in mixed
conifer forest. Fulé and Laughlin (2007) ob -
served that 92% of large (>40 cm) trees in a
nearby mixed conifer forest that survived the
first year after a severe fire survived to the sec-
ond year after the fire. We therefore expect that,
at a minimum, 92% of the large trees in this
study that survived the first year after the low-
intensity surface fire ultimately survived the fire.

†Control data represent forest structure in a similar nearby mixed conifer forest that was unburned in 1999. These data illustrate what forest conditions were like
in the Northwest 3 unit before the first prescribed fire (originally reported in Fulé et al. 2004). Tree densities and fuel loads were very high in this control unit
because the forest had not burned for 114 years.
‡Percent change from before the second-entry fire (‘Prefire [1999]’) to after the second-entry fire (‘Postfire [2008]’) represents stand-level average changes in each
forest structural attribute.
§Management objectives for individual species were not considered in the burn plan by national park staff. Objectives were for conifer species in aggregate because it
is not possible to implement a landscape-scale fire that preferentially kills only certain species. Aspen seedlings were not targeted in the burn, yet data suggest aspen
seedlings were especially susceptible to fire-induced mortality

The prescribed fire had significant impacts
on tree regeneration (Table 1). Total densities of
conifer seedlings <30 cm tall declined signifi-
cantly by 87% (Table 1). We detected significant
reductions in ponderosa pine, white fir, Douglas-
fir, and aspen seedlings <30 cm tall. Aspen was
the only species with seedlings (i.e., sprouting
ramets) >30 cm tall that exhibited significant
mortality. Similarly, the fire had little effect on
sapling densities (Table 1). Our observation that
significant mortality of understory strata was
limited to seedlings <30 cm tall further substan-
tiates the claim that mortality of large trees was
minimal. The large reductions in the smallest
seedling size class was consistent with manage -
ment objectives, but park managers would have
preferred to see greater reductions in the larger
seedling size class and sapling densities. The
reduction in live conifer seedlings will help to
maintain the desired open-forest conditions, and
the density of established seedlings and saplings
are well within the range needed to sustain a
ponderosa pine forest (Bailey and Covington
2002). Although aspen recruitment was signifi-
cantly reduced, we expect aspen regeneration
to continue to flourish, given aspen’s tendency
to sprout vigorously following fire.
The prescribed fire had significant impacts
on fuel loadings (Table 1). Forest floor litter
and duff depths were significantly reduced by
33% and 23%, respectively. Total fine woody
debris declined by 21%, but this reduction was
not significant and did not meet desired objec-
tives. Total coarse woody debris significantly
declined by 44%, thereby meeting the manage -
ment objective for this fuel type. These reduc-
tions in fuel loadings will reduce the intensity
of fires in the short term. Forest floor depths
will steadily rise as senesced leaves are annually
cast onto the ground.
Despite the fact that a few specific objec-
tives were not met (Table 1), land managers in
GCNP feel that these fires achieved their over -
all restoration goals and now consider this forest
to be in “maintenance burning,” meaning that
they plan to allow natural ignitions to maintain
forest structure in the future (Fig. 1). This is a
major accomplishment, considering that this
forest was susceptible to crown ignition and
spread prior to the first fire in 1993 (Fulé et al.
2004). However, given the large reduction in
aspen regeneration observed, aspen stands may
need to be protected from repeated prescribed
fire if the stands are ever to reach maturity.
This protection may be counter to the goals of
restoring a frequent fire regime, but national
park staff are often charged with managing for
multiple resource objectives.
The use of historical (or pre–Euro-American
settlement) ecosystem structure as a target
for ecological restoration has been justifiably
questioned in light of observed and projected
changes in climate (Harris et al. 2006). Why
restore historical ecosystems if they persisted in
a climate that no longer exists? Ecosystems,
specifically those in western North America,
are projected to become increasingly hotter and
drier over the next century (Seager et al. 2007),
thereby increasing the probability of larger,
more frequent wildfires (McKenzie et al. 2004).
Climate change projections are prompting land
managers to consider strategies for promoting
resilience in the face of climate stressors and
climate-induced changes to disturbance regimes
(Dale et al. 2001). Given observed temperature
increases over the last century and future pro-
jections of increased warming (IPCC 2007), it
may seem counterintuitive to continue to use
historical conditions as a reference for restora-
tion (Harris et al. 2006, Millar and Brubaker
2006). However, it was recently argued that
restoration of historical fire regimes in forests
that were adapted to frequent fires can still be
consistent with climate-change expectations.
If fires are predicted to increase in size and
frequency, then it is still logical to reduce
the susceptibility of these forests to stand-
replacing fires through restoration treatments
(Fulé 2008). In particular, restoration treat-
ments in upper elevation ecotones (e.g., mon-
tane mixed conifer forests) may be valuable
for facilitating forest migration and promoting
resilience to a changing disturbance regime.
Where fuel conditions and management
policy permit, fire use in pine-dominated mixed
conifer forests is consistent both with restoring
historical reference conditions and with manag-
ing for resiliency under altered disturbance
regimes accompanying a changing climate. The
second-entry fire made this mixed conifer stand
less susceptible to severe, stand-replacing fires,
and this result is a positive management out-
come, whether future climate is similar to recent
history or whether it is warmer and drier.
Second-entry fire would likely have similar
results in ecosystems not included in this
study, including Douglas-fir–invaded ponderosa
pine forests in the northern Rocky Mountains,
