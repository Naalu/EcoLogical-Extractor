ABSTRACT
Aim We developed an ecosystem classiﬁcation within a 110,000-ha Arizona Pinus
ponderosa P. & C. Lawson (ponderosa pine) landscape to support ecological
restoration
of
these
forests.
Speciﬁc
objectives
included
identifying
key
environmental variables constraining ecosystem distribution and comparing
plant species composition, richness and tree growth among ecosystems.
Location The Coconino National Forest and the Northern Arizona University
Centennial Forest, in northern Arizona, USA.
Methods We sampled geomorphology, soils and vegetation on 66 0.05-ha plots
in open stands containing trees of pre-settlement (c. 1875) origin, and on 26 plots
in dense post-settlement stands. Using cluster analysis and ordination of
vegetation and environment matrices, we classiﬁed plots into ecosystem types
internally similar in environmental and vegetational characteristics.
Results We identiﬁed 10 ecosystem types, ranging from dry, black cinders/
Phacelia ecosystems to moist aspen/Lathyrus ecosystems. Texture, organic carbon
and other soil properties reﬂecting the effects of parent materials structured
ecosystem distribution across the landscape, and geomorphology was locally
important. Plant species composition was ecosystem-speciﬁc, with C3 Festuca
arizonica Vasey (Arizona fescue), for instance, abundant in mesic basalt/Festuca
ecosystems.
Mean
P.
ponderosa
diameter
increments
ranged
from
2.3–
4.3 mm year)1 across ecosystems in stands of pre-settlement origin, and the
ecosystem classiﬁcation was robust in dense post-settlement stands.
Main conclusions Several lines of evidence suggest that although species
composition may have been altered since settlement, the same basic ecosystems
occurred on this landscape in pre-settlement forests, providing reference
information for ecological restoration. Red cinders/Bahia ecosystems were rare
historically and > 30% of their area has been burned by crown ﬁres since 1950,
indicating that priority could be given to restoring this ecosystem’s remaining
mapping units. Ecosystem classiﬁcations may be useful as data layers in gap
analyses to identify restoration and conservation priorities. Ecosystem turnover
occurs at broad extents on this landscape, and restoration must accordingly
operate across large areas to encompass ecosystem diversity. By incorporating
factors driving ecosystem composition, this ecosystem classiﬁcation represents a
framework for estimating spatial variation in ecological properties, such as species
diversity, relevant to ecological restoration.

INTRODUCTION
Geomorphology and soils vary across forest landscapes,
forming mosaics of environmental complexes differing in
productivity and capability to support plant communities
(Hix, 1988; Archambault et al., 1990; Host & Pregitzer, 1992).
Ecosystem classiﬁcation is a tool for identifying interrelation-
ships among environmental variables forming environmental
complexes, discerning gradients constraining vegetation dis-
tribution and productivity, and classifying volumetric envir-
onment–vegetation
units
into
landscape
ecosystems
to
facilitate ecosystem-speciﬁc management (Barnes et al., 1982;
McNab et al., 1999). Goebel et al. (2001), for example,
distinguished 21 ecosystem types along soil texture, drainage
and topographic gradients on an 11,000-ha south-eastern US
Pinus palustris P. Mill. (longleaf pine) landscape. Palik et al.
(2000) then used the ecosystem classiﬁcation to develop
models for prioritizing ecosystem-speciﬁc restoration based on
the historical and current rarity of different ecosystems.
Ecosystem classiﬁcation has been performed and utilized on
numerous landscapes, including north-eastern Chinese pine-
hardwood forests (Barnes et al., 1992), South African ecosys-
tems (Louw & Scholes, 2002), early successional British
Columbian forests (Klinka et al., 1985) and Michigan oak
and wetland ecosystems (Archambault et al., 1990).
A voluminous literature on ecosystem classiﬁcation has
apparently accrued largely in isolation from mainstream
biogeography, and ecosystem classiﬁcation is rarely mentioned
in biogeography textbooks. However, the underpinnings of
ecosystem classiﬁcation correspond to several important
subdivisions of biogeography (MacDonald, 2003). For exam-
ple, interactions among abiotic environments and plant
communities form a basis for classifying ecosystem types,
and these interactions are the focus of ecological biogeography.
Phytogeography is concerned with the distributions of plants,
which are used in ecosystem classiﬁcation to distinguish
ecosystems and explain vegetation–environment relationships
(Kashian et al., 2003a). Numerous studies also have utilized
ecosystem classiﬁcations as frameworks to study plant distri-
butions, diversity and tree growth (e.g. Hix, 1988; Host &
Pregitzer,
1992;
Lapin
&
Barnes,
1995).
While
animal
distributions studied in zoogeography have not been directly
utilized as part of ecosystem classiﬁcation to date, recent
studies that have examined bird distributions have found close
correspondence
with
existing
ecosystem
classiﬁcations
(Kashian et al., 2003b; Camp, 2004). In the eastern US
southern Appalachians, for example, Camp (2004) found that
Limnothlypis swainsonii (Swainson’s warbler) was most fre-
quent in mesic hemlock/rhododendron ecosystems, while
Helmitheros vermivorus (worm-eating warbler) characterized
xeric ecosystems previously classiﬁed by Abella et al. (2003).
Camp (2004) concluded that the ecosystem classiﬁcation was
useful for modelling avian distributions across the landscape,
and for identifying habitat for rare species of particular
conservation concern. Palik et al.’s (2000) use of an ecosystem
classiﬁcation to prioritize ecosystem restoration provides
another example of the relationship of ecosystem classiﬁcation
to conservation biogeography, which is concerned with
protecting and restoring native species and communities. By
more fully exploiting the relationships between ecosystem
classiﬁcation and biogeography we may enhance our under-
standing of species distributions, and improve our ability to
conserve and restore ecosystems at landscape scales.
Ecosystem classiﬁcation is increasingly being developed and
utilized in the forests of the eastern USA (e.g. Lapin & Barnes,
1995; McNab et al., 1999; Abella et al., 2003), but little
ecosystem classiﬁcation or soil-site research has been published
for the vast Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson (ponderosa pine)
forests of the south-western USA. Vegetation-based habitat
classiﬁcations (Hanks et al., 1983; Muldavin et al., 1990) or
soil or landform type classiﬁcations (Leven et al., 1972) have
been more common in these forests. Recently, however, the US
Forest Service has published Terrestrial Ecosystem Surveys
(TES) for several south-western national forests (Ganey &
Benoit, 2002). These TES land classiﬁcations provide geor-
eferenced maps and soil classiﬁcation data similar to those of
eastern US soil surveys (Miller et al., 1995). Although TES
have been extensively developed for south-western P. ponde-
rosa forests, there are no published comparisons between TES
and ecosystem classiﬁcation. Such comparisons and advances
in site classiﬁcation would be timely to assist the development
of ecosystem response functions to restoration and manage-
ment prescriptions, which are urgently needed to conserve
P. ponderosa landscapes.
Ecosystem integrity in south-western P. ponderosa forests has
declined since Euro-American settlement (c. 1875) for several
reasons (Fule´ et al., 1997; Moore et al., 1999; Allen et al., 2002).
Historically frequent surface ﬁres were excluded, contributing to
fuel buildups and shifts to stand-replacing ﬁre regimes. Irrup-
tions in small-diameter tree densities and decreases in old trees
have altered plant communities and wildlife habitat. Escalating
small-diameter tree densities, far outside a range of historical
variability, reduced native understorey plant communities in
combination with livestock grazing. While the need for fuel
reduction to reduce the probability of catastrophic ﬁre is clear,
many authors have further suggested that ecological restoration
is needed to alleviate many other problems plaguing these forests
(Covington et al., 1994; Moore et al., 1999; Allen et al., 2002).
The accelerated mortality of old trees, insect outbreaks, exotic
species invasions and simpliﬁcation of native communities are
only a few examples of declining ecosystem integrity observed in
P. ponderosa forests (Allen et al., 2002). A scientiﬁc consensus
has emerged that primary restorative treatments needed in these
forests include thinning small-diameter trees and re-introducing
surface ﬁre (Covington et al., 1994; Allen et al., 2002), with
exotic species management, seeding native species and other
treatments also required on some sites (Moore et al., 1999).
A key point is that the goals of ecological restoration are not
necessarily to re-create replicas of pre-settlement ecosystems.
Rather, the objective is to align the current degraded ecosystems
on a trajectory toward recovery within an approximate range of
historical variability characterizing the evolutionary environ-

ments of native species (Morgan et al., 1994; Moore et al., 1999).
Evolutionary environments are key concepts in both restoration
ecology and biogeography (Morgan et al., 1994; MacDonald,
2003). A recent study by Palik et al. (2000) showed how
ecosystem classiﬁcation can provide insight into the evolution-
ary environments of native plant communities, based on the
observation that environments vary geographically within
landscapes. Topography and soil parent material are relatively
stable landscape features, making present-day ecosystems clas-
siﬁed using those stable features a source of reference informa-
tion on evolutionary environments (White & Walker, 1997).
We undertook this study to develop a multifactor ecosystem
classiﬁcation within a 110,000-ha P. ponderosa landscape in
northern Arizona, USA. Speciﬁc objectives included: (1)
identifying primary environmental and vegetational gradients
and their interrelationships associated with ecosystem distribu-
tion, (2) comparing community composition, species richness
and tree growth among classiﬁed ecosystems, and (3) providing
examples of applications for ecological restoration and hypoth-
esis generation for future research. Our study focuses on
advancing the biogeographical disciplines of ecological biogeo-
graphy, phytogeography and conservation biogeography in this
region through the use of ecosystem classiﬁcation.
METHODS
Study area
We performed this study at elevations between 1920 and 2660 m
in the Northern Arizona University Centennial Forest and in the
north half of the Coconino National Forest near the city of
Flagstaff, AZ (Fig. 1). Pinus ponderosa is the dominant tree
species and forms extensive pure stands, but sometimes occurs
with Quercus gambelii Nutt. (Gambel oak) or Populus tremulo-
ides Michx. (trembling aspen). Precipitation increases and
temperatures decrease from east to west across the study area,
with precipitation ranging from 42–56 cm year)1, snowfall
from 152 to 233 cm year)1 and maximum mean daily temper-
atures from 15.7 to 17.5 C (Western Regional Climate Center,
Reno, NV, USA). Topography is primarily ﬂat or undulating
(slope gradients < 10%), occasionally punctuated by cinder
cones, ravines and low hills. Volcanic activity has been wide-
spread, with the most recent eruptions occurring c.900 years ago
in the Sunset Crater Volcanic Field in the north-eastern part of
the study area (Moore et al., 1976). Soil parent materials include
basalt, volcanic cinders, benmoreite, mixed igneous rocks, and
limestone (Welch & Klemmedson, 1975). Major soil subgroups
are Typic and Udic Argiborolls, Typic and Mollic Eutroboralfs,
Typic Ustorthents and Vitrandic Ustochrepts (Miller et al.,
1995). Lightning-ignited surface ﬁres in pre-settlement forests
occurred on average at least once every 10 years, maintaining
open stand structures (Fule´ et al., 1997). Most of the study area,
however, has had sustained ﬁre exclusion, timber harvest and
heavy livestock grazing since settlement, which may have
inﬂuenced present-day ground-ﬂora composition in some areas
(Moore et al., 1999).
Site selection
We used a digital TES map (Miller et al., 1995) in a geographical
information system to randomly select six mapping units for
sampling in each of 11TES types (55,500, 513, 523, 536, 551, 558,
570, 582, 585 and 611) encompassing a range of soils. These TES
types served as an a priori stratiﬁcation for sampling, a procedure

and their classiﬁcation into ecosystem types
for a Pinus ponderosa landscape in northern
Arizona, USA (UTM zone 12). Geographical
features are abbreviated as GF and weather
stations as WS. Although at similar elevations
(2128–2244 m), precipitation based on
> 35 years of records averages 42 cm year)1
at the eastern weather station 1 (Sunset
Crater), 54 cm year)1 at central station 2
(Flagstaff Airport) and 56 cm year)1 at sta-
tion 1 (Fort Valley). Ecosystem type abbre-
viations are as follows: AN ¼ aspen/Lathyrus,
BC ¼ black cinders/Phacelia, CB ¼ clay
basalt/Gutierrezia, MB ¼ mesic basalt/
Festuca, ML ¼ mesic limestone/mixed ﬂora,
PK ¼ park/Symphyotrichum, RB ¼ rocky
basalt/Sporobolus, RC ¼ red cinders/Bahia,
XB ¼ xeric basalt/Muhlenbergia and
XL ¼ xeric limestone/Bouteloua.

commonly employed in the iterative process of ecosystem
classiﬁcation (Host et al., 1992). We sampled a 0.05-ha
(20 m · 25 m) plot in each mapping unit in areas exhibiting
open canopies, relatively intact understoreys and no apparent
major recent disturbance. Areas dominated by trees of pre-
settlement origin most frequently met these criteria (Kerns et al.,
2003). These 66 open-canopy plots were used to develop the
ecosystem classiﬁcation, and we sampled an additional 26 plots
in dense post-settlement stands in 536, 570 and 585 TES
mapping units to ascertain classiﬁcation viability in dense
stands. These stands typically exceeded 1000 Pinus ponderosa
trees ha)1, in contrast to typical densities of < 150 trees ha)1 in
stands of pre-settlement origin.
Environmental measurements
We sampled plots from May to August 2003. On each plot, we
recorded elevation, transformed aspect (Beers et al., 1966),
slope gradient and terrain shape index (McNab, 1989). Terrain
shape index measures local topographical geometry, and we
based measurements on eight clinometer sightings every 45 to
a change in topographical shape (Abella, 2003). We measured
surface rock cover by recording substrate every 0.3 m along a
25-m transect, and obtained rock samples later identiﬁed by a
geologist (Sam Bourque, Ecological Restoration Institute,
Flagstaff, AZ, USA). We collected composite soil samples
from depths of 0–15 and 15–50 cm from two pits per plot, and
examined deeper layers to 150 cm or to an impervious layer
using a bucket auger. Soil samples were air dried, sieved
through a 2-mm sieve, and analysed for CaCO3 equivalent
[Goh et al.’s (1993) approximate gravimetric method], texture
(hydrometer method), pH (1 : 2 soil:0.01 m CaCl2), and
organic C and total N (C/N analyser after removal of inorganic
C with HCl) following Bartels & Bigham (1996) and Dane &
Topp (2002). Analytical errors averaged < 5% based on a
repeated measurement every 10 samples. We also estimated
soil available water capacity using Saxton et al.’s (1986)
equations incorporating texture, gravel content and organic
matter (estimated as organic C · 1.724).
On three plots randomly selected in each of six ecosystem
types, we measured gravimetric 0–15 cm soil moisture (24 h,
105 C oven drying) averaged from two soil cores each of
208 cm3 per plot. We selected these six ecosystem types for
moisture measurements to span a range of expected moisture
levels based on texture and organic C analyses. We made
moisture measurements during the driest period of the year,
on 19 June 2004 after no measurable precipitation had fallen
since April (Western Regional Climate Center, Reno, NV,
USA). Measurement errors averaged < 5% based on analysing
a duplicate sample every six samples.
Vegetation measurements
In 15, 1-m2 subplots per plot centred at 0.5, 5, 12.5, 20 and
24.5 m along plot axes, we visually categorized areal per cent
cover of each ground-ﬂora species rooted in subplots. Cover
categories were: 0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5% and 1% up to 1% cover,
1% intervals to 10% cover, and 5% intervals above 10% cover.
Measurement error, based on remeasuring two randomly
selected subplots every six plots, averaged < 0.25% for total
cover and < 0.25 species m)2. We also made a complete
census of species in whole plots on a presence/absence basis,
and assigned these species a frequency of one and the lowest
cover for computing importance values (average of relative
frequency and relative cover summing to 100% on a plot
basis). Nomenclature follows USDA-NRCS (2004).
To measure tree growth, we cored two dominant, open-
grown P. ponderosa of pre-settlement origin on each open-
canopy plot at 0.4 m above ground level. Cores were sanded,
mounted and cross-dated using local tree-ring chronologies
(Fule´ et al., 1997). We measured diameter increment between
ages of 50 and 150 years at 0.4 m height to avoid potential
measurement inaccuracies due to missed piths, while provi-
ding a growth measure in the early–middle life stage of
P. ponderosa (Schubert, 1974). We used diameter increment as
a growth measure rather than site index, because site index
equations have not been developed for old, uneven-aged
south-western P. ponderosa stands as sampled for this study.
Statistical analysis
We developed the ecosystem classiﬁcation by classifying and
ordinating the environmental matrix using cluster analysis
(variables
relativized
by
maximums,
Euclidean
distance,
Ward’s linkage method) and principal components analysis
(correlation matrix) in PC-ORD (McCune & Mefford, 1999).
We classiﬁed and ordinated the importance value vegetation
matrix using cluster analysis (Sørensen distance, )0.25 ﬂexible
beta linkage) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (auto-
pilot, thorough mode). After identifying seven plot groupings
in these analyses, with 24 remaining plots chieﬂy of basalt
parent materials not clearly distinguished, we performed a
second iteration of classiﬁcation and ordination separately on
these 24 plots. This analysis identiﬁed three plot groupings
distinguished by soil properties and plant composition. We
also used abundances of ecological species groups, classiﬁed in
previous research on the plots (Abella, 2005), to help
discriminate ecosystems. Species groups consist of plant
species that share similar environmental afﬁnities, and have
frequently been developed in conjunction with ecosystem
classiﬁcation to categorize plant distributions and differentiate
ecosystems (Kashian et al., 2003a). The ﬁnal ecosystem
classiﬁcation was based on plot groups internally similar in
environmental
properties
and
species
composition.
We
employed cluster analysis and ordination iteratively as com-
plementary analyses, but we present only the results of
ordinations to portray plot groupings and continuous vari-
ation (Host et al., 1992).
We compared means of environmental variables, species
richness
and

classiﬁed ecosystems using one-way analysis of variance

Institute, 2002). Raw data approximated assumptions of
equal variance (Levene test) and normality (Shapiro–Wilk
W test).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Classiﬁcation
We classiﬁed and named 10 landscape ecosystem types on the
basis of diagnostic environmental features and characteristic
species along a continuum ranging from the black cinders/
Phacelia ecosystem, with the driest surface soils and lowest
plant cover, to moist aspen/Lathyrus and treeless park/
Symphyotrichum ecosystems (Table 1 & Fig. 2). Other ecosys-
tems differed more subtly, such as the xeric basalt/Muhlenber-
gia ecosystem differentiated from the mesic basalt/Festuca
ecosystem by exhibiting sandier soils, less organic C and more
Muhlenbergia montana (Nutt.) A.S. Hitchc. (mountain muhly)
than Festuca arizonica Vasey (Arizona fescue). Seven ecosys-
tems corresponded with a respective TES type, whereas three
ecosystems each occurred on combinations of the 551, 570,
582, and 585 TES types, mostly containing basalt parent
material (Miller et al., 1995). Of six plots sampled in the 582
TES type, for example, we classiﬁed four into the mesic basalt/
Festuca and two into the rocky basalt/Sporobolus ecosystems.
This increased internal mean Sørensen similarities of under-
storey vegetation from 44% within the 582 TES type to 55%
within this study’s mesic basalt/Festuca ecosystem. Results
suggest that TES broadly differentiated distinctively different
ecosystems, but did not detect multivariate interactions among
environmental variables distinguishing closely related ecosys-
tems (Fig. 3). Similar to eastern US soil surveys, however, TES
is a starting point for understanding ecosystem distribution on
this landscape (Pregitzer et al., 2001). By identifying interre-
lationships, ecosystem classiﬁcation is useful for reﬁning or
complementing TES in south-western USA national forests.
Environmental complexes
Ecosystems were primarily differentiated along soil gradients
(Fig. 3), reﬂecting differences among soil parent materials
based on the presence or absence of volcanic activity (Welch
& Klemmedson, 1975). In contrast with ecosystem classiﬁca-
tion in the eastern USA, where geomorphology often forms
an initial layer distinguishing ecosystems (Hix, 1988; Host &
Pregitzer, 1992; Abella et al., 2003), ecosystem distribution
was
not
closely
associated
with
the
geomorphological
variables of aspect, slope gradient or terrain shape index.
Slope gradients averaged < 8% in all ecosystems except for
the red cinders/Bahia ecosystem, so most plots did not
exhibit strong aspects. Terrain shape index was mostly near
zero, reﬂecting fairly linear topography (McNab, 1989). This
index averaged only a slightly convex value ()2.1) in the red
cinders/Bahia ecosystem because of the convex cinder cones
this ecosystem often occupied. The park/Symphyotrichum
ecosystem had weakly concave (1.9) terrain shapes, consis-
tent with this ecosystem’s occurrence in depressions a few
metres lower than the surrounding forested topography

(Strahler, 1944). While geomorphology may inﬂuence the
composition of ecosystems in rare, localized areas, such as in
particularly deep ravines that we did not sample (Crawford
Zimmerman et al., 1999), the ﬂat to undulating topography
on most of
the landscape minimally
affects ecosystem
distribution.

Soil properties such as texture and organic C, in contrast to
geomorphological variables, sharply differed among ecosys-
tems (Table 2). The sand concentration from 0 to 15 cm in the
black cinders/Phacelia ecosystem, for example, exceeded 90%.
The red cinders/Bahia and limestone ecosystems also were
sandy, with 0–15 cm sand concentrations averaging between
53% and 63%. Clay basalt/Gutierrezia, rocky basalt/Sporobolus
and park/Symphyotrichum ecosystems contained the most clay
from 0 to 50 cm. High clay concentrations in park/Symphyo-
trichum ecosystems, combined with the ﬂat depressions
occupied by parks, may explain early accounts that some
parks were seasonally shallow lakes (Kircher, 1910). Parks have
probably become drier because of hydrological alterations
from livestock tanks (Rusby, 1889). Siltier textures, higher
organic C and 0.03–0.05 m3 m)3 greater water-holding capa-
cities (Saxton et al., 1986) partly distinguish the mesic basalt/
Festuca ecosystem from other basalt ecosystems. Organic C and
total N concentrations were also large in the aspen/Lathyrus
ecosystem, probably reﬂecting this ecosystem’s high produc-
tivity where mean ground-ﬂora cover was highest (35%). The
low-density cinders in black and red cinder ecosystems (Moore
et al., 1976) result in higher gravel and lower N and organic C
contents volumetrically than on a weight basis (Welch &
Klemmedson, 1975), decreasing soil fertility in these ecosys-
tems.
Mean pH ranged from 5.9 to 7.0 across ecosystems,
exceeding
6.5
in
xeric
limestone/Bouteloua,
clay
basalt/
Gutierrezia, and cinder ecosystems (Table 2). The mesic
limestone/mixed ﬂora ecosystem had among the lowest 0–
15 cm pH; we also did not detect appreciable CaCO3

equivalents in this ecosystem. CaCO3 equivalent was the only
soil property not signiﬁcantly different among ecosystems,
with the highest, but variable, amount in the xeric limestone/
Bouteloua ecosystem. While pH does not seem to be driven by
carbonate equilibria on this landscape, high-pH ecosystems are
apparently associated with parent materials rich in exchange-
able bases that also occupy dry sites where leaching rates may
be slower.
Principal components analysis portrayed correlations among
environmental variables and their relative importance in struc-
turing the environmental matrix, with 40% of variance
explained by principal component 1, 20% by component 2
and 10% by component 3 (Fig. 3a). Component loadings were
well balanced among 17 important environmental variables
included in the analysis, consistent with ecosystem classiﬁcation
theory that ecosystem distribution is structured by multivariate
combinations of environmental variables rather than only
single-factor gradients (Barnes et al., 1982; Host & Pregitzer,
1992; Goebel et al., 2001). Variables exhibiting the highest
loadings on component 1 included 0–15 cm sand (load-
ing ¼ )0.34), 15–50 cm silt (0.30), Universal Transverse Mer-
cator (UTM) easting ()0.29), 0–50 cm available water (0.29),
15–50 cm C and N (both 0.27) and 15–50 cm pH ()0.26). Based
on three weather stations (Fig. 1) and a regional climate study
(Jameson, 1969), UTM easting is probably partly correlated with
a precipitation gradient increasing by c. 14 cm year)1 from east
to west across the study area. Ecosystems containing soils with
low water-holding capacities also tended to occur in eastern
parts of the study area, where low precipitation may amplify
these dry-soil properties (Fig. 1). Dry-season gravimetric soil
moisture differed by more than a factor of 20 across ecosystems,
expressing
these
contrasting
environmental
complexes
(Table 2). Parent material and its inﬂuence on soil properties,
modiﬁed regionally by precipitation gradients and locally by
rockiness or geomorphological gradients, constrained the dis-
tribution, productivity and composition of ecosystems on this
landscape.
Species composition and richness
A total of 271 plant species occurred on the 66 open-canopy
plots, with some species like Phacelia sericea (Graham) Gray
(purplefringe) of the black cinders/Phacelia ecosystem and
Symphyotrichum ascendens (Lindl.) Nesom (western aster) of
the park/Symphyotrichum ecosystem, restricted to one ecosys-
tem type (Table 3). Muhlenbergia minutissima (Steud.) Swallen
(annual muhly), Nama dichotomum (Ruiz & Pavo´n) Choisy
(wishbone ﬁddleleaf) and other annuals dominated the black
cinders/Phacelia ecosystem. These data concur with theories
that annuals are successful in ecosystems of unpredictable
moisture (Philippi, 1993), but may also be related to
continuous disturbances caused by movements of the loose
cinders
(Fig. 2a).
Grazing-resistant
Gutierrezia
sarothrae
(Pursh) Britt. & Rusby (broom snakeweed) or Erigeron
divergens Torr. & Gray (spreading ﬂeabane) dominated clay
basalt/Gutierrezia or park/Symphyotrichum ecosystems, prob-
ably the most heavily grazed ecosystems (Clary, 1975). Mesic
limestone/mixed ﬂora ecosystems, exhibiting intermediate soil
resources (Table 2), shared species of many ecosystems and
had no clear dominant species. This ﬁnding seemingly concurs
with hypotheses that intermediate resource levels promote
species coexistence (Tilman & Pacala, 1993).
Grass
distribution
differentiated

related
basalt
ecosystems, with C4 M. montana important in the xeric
basalt/Muhlenbergia ecosystem and C3 F. arizonica prominent
in the mesic basalt/Festuca ecosystem (Table 3). These distri-
butions, combined with the great importance of C4 Bouteloua
gracilis (Willd. ex Kunth) Lag. ex Grifﬁths (blue grama) in
climatically dry ecosystems, support predictions that C4 species
have greater water-use efﬁciencies and competitive abilities in
dry habitats than C3 species (Wentworth, 1983). The rocky
basalt/Sporobolus ecosystem was distinguished by the high
importance of Sporobolus interruptus Vasey (black dropseed),
Lathyrus laetivirens Greene ex Rydb. (aspen peavine), and
Pedicularis centranthera Gray (dwarf lousewort). Legumes
including Lupinus argenteus Pursh (silver lupine), Vicia
americana Muhl. Ex Willd. (American purple vetch) and
Lathyrus lanszwertii var. leucanthus (Rydb.) Dorn (Nevada
vetchling) predominated in the aspen/Lathyrus ecosystem. It is
possible these legumes contributed to the high levels of soil N
in this ecosystem (Crews, 1999). The park/Symphyotrichum
ecosystem also contained several mesophytic species, including
Iris missouriensis Nutt. (Rocky Mountain iris) and Allium
geyeri S. Wats. (Geyer’s onion), uncommon elsewhere.
Limestone ecosystems possessed the most species per 500-m2
plot, and richness per plot also averaged > 38 species in rocky
basalt/Sporobolus, clay basalt/Gutierrezia and red cinders/Bahia
ecosystems (Fig. 4a). Black cinders/Phacelia and aspen/Lathyrus
ecosystems, occupying extremes of low and high productivity
and soil-resource gradients, had the fewest species per plot. The
aspen/Lathyrus ecosystem, however, exhibited high richness per
1-m2 subplot, reﬂecting high species densities at ﬁne grains in
this ecosystem but rapid levelling off of species richness
(Fig. 4b). Ecosystem distribution predicted spatial variation in
species composition and richness on this landscape reasonably
well, presumably because the ecosystem framework integrated
factors that were constraining composition and richness (Lapin
& Barnes, 1995).
Pinus ponderosa growth
The oldest tree was dated to 1646, and all trees in the data set
were of pre-settlement origin, recording growth rates in pre-
settlement forests. Mean P. ponderosa diameter growth differed
by nearly a factor of two across ecosystems (Fig. 5). The
slowest growth occurred in the red cinders/Bahia ecosystem,
whereas the fastest growth occurred in aspen/Lathyrus ecosys-
tems containing mixed P. ponderosa–Populus tremuloides
forests. Growth rates also tended to be 0.7–0.8 mm year)1
higher in mesic basalt than in rocky or xeric basalt ecosystems,
probably reﬂecting the mesic basalt’s greater rooting volume
because of fewer rocks and more available water. While the
S. R. Abella and W. W. Covington

black cinders/Phacelia ecosystem contained inhospitable sur-
face soils, variable, but on average rapid, diameter growth
occurred once a tree became established. This paradox may
result because of minimal ground-ﬂora competition, deep
subsoils (> 1.5 m) consisting of alternating cinder–soil layers
retaining subsoil moisture, or loose soils facilitating develop-
ment of extensive, branched root systems (Haasis, 1921).
Colton (1932) also noted that rapid diameter growth occurred
on black cinder soils near Sunset Crater in the study area, and
Lindsey (1951) found that the greatest mean increment of
3.4 mm year)1 among central New Mexico soils he studied
occurred on volcanic cinder soils.
Previous research in south-western P. ponderosa forests has
produced conﬂicting results on whether P. ponderosa growth
differs among land classiﬁcation units (Meurisse et al., 1975;
Stansﬁeld et al., 1991). Mathiasen et al. (1987), for example,
found that site index did not differ among seven vegetation-
based habitat types in Colorado, New Mexico and northern
Arizona. Verbyla & Fisher (1989) also concluded that habitat
types did not reliably predict P. ponderosa site index in
southern Utah because of wide environmental variation within
habitat types. Meurisse et al. (1975), however, reported site
indices ranging from 17 to 26 m (base age 100 years) that
differed signiﬁcantly among 12 northern Arizona soil series.
Our ﬁndings combined with those of Lindsey (1951) and
Meurisse et al. (1975) suggest that land classiﬁcations such as
soil or ecosystem classiﬁcation are useful for predicting
P. ponderosa growth, because these classiﬁcations incorporate
environmental variables affecting growth (Cox et al., 1960).
Classiﬁcation in dense stands
A possible criticism of this ecosystem classiﬁcation is that it
was developed in open stands of pre-settlement origin, whereas
most of the landscape contains dense post-settlement stands
typically exceeding 1000 trees ha)1, exhibiting low ground-
ﬂora cover, and often requiring the most intensive restoration
(Abella & Covington, 2004). Species composition differen-
tiated by ecosystem type even more strongly in dense than in
open stands, and ecosystems in dense stands also differentiated
along rock cover, texture and other gradients as in open stands
(Fig. 6). Mesic limestone/mixed ﬂora ecosystems in dense
stands had sandy soil textures and no clear dominant species
similar to their open counterparts, while grass distribution and
environmental gradients distinguished basalt ecosystems. The
ecosystem speciﬁcity of plant composition may have intensi-

ecosystems of a northern Arizona Pinus ponderosa landscape. Species are arranged from dry to moist afﬁnities, and values in bold represent
ecosystems in which a species was most important. These 24 species (of 271 total detected species) are representative examples of species that
were previously classiﬁed on this landscape into ecological species groups useful for distinguishing ecosystem types (Abella, 2005)

Implications for ecological restoration
Reference conditions
Estimating reference conditions is a major goal in restoration
ecology and conservation biogeography (White & Walker,
1997). Reference conditions for Arizona P. ponderosa forests
are usually considered to be c. 1875 (European settlement)
because this is the most recent time at which these forests are
thought to have been free of degrading factors such as ﬁre
exclusion (Moore et al., 1999). Three lines of evidence suggest
that ecosystems similar to those classiﬁed in this study
occurred on this landscape at the time of settlement: (1)
abiotic variables such as soil texture forming the backbones of
ecosystems are considered relatively stable landscape features
(Palik et al., 2000), (2) major differences in tree growth
occurred among sites in pre-settlement forests (Fig. 5) and (3)
historical reports and photographs provide accounts of

ecosystems of a Pinus ponderosa landscape,

geographically speciﬁc occurrences of ecosystems like parks
and sites exhibiting different soil texture and rock cover
(Rusby, 1889; Leiberg et al., 1904; Kircher, 1910). An import-
ant point is that while grazing and other factors may have
altered the species composition of some ecosystems since
settlement (Hanson, 1924), these are similar ecosystem types
but with different species composition. A given ecosystem type
may contain multiple species compositions during different
time periods (Archambault et al., 1990; Goebel et al., 2001;
Abella et al., 2003). This is consistent with a guiding premise of
ecosystem classiﬁcation that vegetation comprises only one,
and usually the least stable, of three basic landscape ecosystem
components of geomorphology, soils and vegetation (Barnes
et al., 1982).
Reference conditions for herbaceous vegetation are not well
known in P. ponderosa forests, similar to many ecosystems
(Moore et al., 1999), hampering efforts to deﬁne and restore
target communities (Bakker et al., 2000). Although historical
accounts suggest that most native species currently on this
landscape occurred in pre-settlement forests, these accounts
provide little information about species distributions and,
unfortunately, were also recorded after the initiation of heavy
livestock grazing (Vasey, 1888; Britton, 1889). While herbar-
ium records and other reconstructive methods (e.g. Kerns
et al., 2003) may provide additional clues to past composition,
the present study’s information on modern ecosystems is one
of the few currently available references on species–soil
relationships. Although imperfect like other reference infor-
mation, and best used in combination with other data sources,
modern ecosystems are an important source of reference
information (White & Walker, 1997; Palik et al., 2000).
The current distributions of some species among ecosys-
tems, for example, probably places approximate bounds on
where

(Table 3). In contrast to M. montana, for instance, F. arizonica
is absent from dry ecosystems such as the red cinders/Bahia
ecosystem and probably did not occur in such ecosystems in
pre-settlement forests. Festuca arizonica is a C3 species poorly
adapted to xeric sites (Sage & Monson, 1999). If a land
manager has limited funds to purchase seeds for revegetating a
moist, loamy basalt site burned by wildﬁre, for example,
revegetating the site with F. arizonica and other native species
of the mesic basalt/Festuca ecosystem seems more accurate
than using general species mixes that may not have grown on
these sites. Furthermore, experiments with current ecosystems,
such as re-introducing ﬁre and comparing the responses of
different ecosystems, may enhance our understanding of past
composition of the diverse ecosystems on this landscape.
Prioritization and scale
Ecological restoration in the study area has largely been
prioritized near the city of Flagstaff in the wildland–urban
interface, which is prudent because recent wildﬁres in

P. ponderosa forests have threatened human settlements (Allen
et al., 2002). This approach may well not prioritize other
ecosystems farther from settlements, however, that also require
restoration (Palik et al., 2000). The red cinders/Bahia ecosys-
tem, for example, was historically rare, based on its soil
distribution, occupying < 1840 ha or < 1.7% of the study area
(Miller et al., 1995). About 9/32 (28%) of this ecosystem’s
mapping units (> 30% of its area) have also been burned by
crown ﬁres since 1950, suggesting that the red cinders/Bahia
ecosystem is the most endangered landscape ecosystem in the
study area. Priority could be given to restoring this ecosystem’s
remaining mapping units to forestall further losses by crown
ﬁres. This application illustrates that ecosystem classiﬁcation
might be useful as a data layer in geographical information
systems for gap analysis (Scott et al., 1993).
Ecosystem turnover occurs at broad extents on this land-
scape, with mapping units sometimes exceeding 1000 ha
(Miller et al., 1995). This differs from ecosystem classiﬁcation
in many eastern US forests where ecosystem turnover is
spatially rapid (Lapin & Barnes, 1995; McNab et al., 1999;
Goebel et al., 2001). Broad-extent turnover suggests that
restoring dispersed mapping units of different ecosystems or
large areas will be required to encompass ecosystem diversity
in restoration on this landscape. The sizes of restoration units
required to encompass multiple ecosystem types, for instance,
could be conceptualized as an ecosystem–area curve. Financial
and other resources for conducting restoration are often
limited, suggesting that an important topic of future research is
estimating the optimal sizes and distributions of restoration
units to maximize cumulative ecosystem diversity included in
restoration.
CONCLUSION
Ecosystem distribution on this landscape followed the distri-
bution of soil properties and parent materials, modiﬁed by
regional precipitation gradients and locally by variables such as
rock cover and geomorphology. An important area of future
research is examining rare ecosystems such as springs or deep
ravines (Crawford Zimmerman et al., 1999) which we did not
sample and which may be keystone ecosystems requiring
special restoration (Stohlgren et al., 1997). It is important to
recognize that vegetation is one of the more transient and
easily changed ecosystem components, whereas properties such
as soil parent material are ﬁxed for long time periods. This
persistence suggests that the same basic ecosystems currently
on this landscape occurred at the time of settlement. Multiple
classiﬁcations, such as vegetation or stand condition classes, in
combination with ecosystem classiﬁcation, will probably
provide the most comprehensive site information data base
to guide restoration. A given ecosystem type may contain
constituent sites widely differing in current conditions, with
the mesic basalt/Festuca ecosystem, for example, currently
containing sites burned by crown ﬁre or showing indications
of overgrazing. Relatively intact sites within ecosystems,
however, exhibited high degrees of similarity, suggesting that
reference conditions within ecosystem types may be similar.
This study provides an initial ecosystem framework for
ecological restoration on this landscape that can be improved
by future research that: (1) measures past species composition,
ﬁre regime and stand structure reference conditions among
ecosystems,
(2)
estimates
ecosystem-speciﬁc
differences
between reference and current conditions, (3) identiﬁes target
communities for restoration and ecosystem-speciﬁc vegetation
successional sequences and (4) replicates restoration experi-
ments across ecosystem types to measure ecosystem-speciﬁc
responses.
