Highlight 
A severe May wildfire decimated an unthinned ponderosa 
pine stand in northern Arizona, while an adjacent thinned 
stand was relatively undamaged. 
Radial growth increased 
on burned trees where crown kill was less than 60% and 
decreased where crown kill was more than 60%. 
Burning 
initially stimulated growth of herbaceous vegetation in both 
stands. Herbage nutrient value was temporarily 
enhanced 
due to burning. 
Artificially 
seeded areas produced most 
herbage 2 years after burning. 
Wildfire 
is a constant 
threat 
to ponderosa 
pine 
forests 
in the Southwest, 
but little 
has been 
pub- 
lished 
about 
effects 
of severe 
wildfire 
on lesser 
vegetation.

were 
measured 
prior 
to and following 
a severe 
May wildfire 
in 
northern 
Arizona. 
Study Area and Methods 
In 1967, lightning started a wildfire in a ponderosa pine 
(Pinus 
ponderosa 
Laws.) stand north of Flagstaff. 
About 
800 acres of pine timber were burned, including two exper- 
imental 
pastures on the Wild 
Bill Range 
(Pearson and 
Jameson, 
1967). Since tree and herbage growth had been 
measured for 5 years prior, the fire provided an opportunity 
to evaluate the damage and recovery of the vegetation. 
The study area burned May 9, 1967, during clear weather, 
3 days after a light snow and rain storm (0.14 inch precipi- 
tation). 
The upper layer of litter was relatively dry, the 
lower litter was moist, and wind averaged 20 to 40 mph. 
The fire danger rating was high. 
Before 
it burned, 
one 
pasture 
(unthinned) 
had 
an 
average of 126 f@/acre basal area of pine trees which had 
not been logged or thinned for many years. This uneven- 
aged stand included many young trees established in 1919 
through natural regeneration, 
and some older trees dating 
back to the 1800â€™s. The other pasture had been thinned in 
1963 to approximately 20 fta/acre. 
The dense, unthinned 
stand in one pasture burned by 
crown fire with flames 30 to 40 ft above the tree tops. The 
thinned stand in the other pasture burned by ground fire 
with tree scorch several feet high on the boles. 
Native understory 
vegetation 
before 
the fire consisted 
mainly of Arizona fescue (Festuca 
arizonica Vasey), mountain 
muhly (Muhlenbergia 
montana 
(Nutt.) Hit&.), 
bottlebrush

squirreltail 
(Sitanion

(Nutt.) 
J. G. Smith), 
sedge 
(Carex

Mackenz.), and a variety of forbs. The pri- 
mary shrub was Fendler 
ceanothus 
(Ceanothus 
fendleri 
A. Gray). Exotic species seeded in June after the fire in a 
portion 
of the unthinned 
pasture included 
orchardgrass 
(Dactylis 
glomeruta 
L.) and intermediate 
wheatgrass (Agro- 
pyron 
in termed&m 
(Host) Beauv.). 
Ponderosa pine density was measured by two methods at 
45 mechanically spaced locations in each pasture. Tree basal 
area was measured at breast height by the Bitterlich plotless 
method (Grosenbaugh, 
1952) with a lo-factor prism. Tree 
crown cover was measured with a spherical densitometer. 
Tree growth data were obtained from an increment core 
extracted at breast height from the south face of 30 trees in 
the spring of 1969 to evaluate individual growth response. 
These trees were selected to cover the entire range of crown 
kill. 
Growth at breast height provided an estimate of re- 
sponse to thinning and to the burn. 
Herbage production (ovendry) by species was determined 
by clipping 
and weighing 
the material 
under 45 caged 
plots in each pasture at the end of each growing season. 
These plots were established in 15 randomly located per- 
manent sampling clusters. 
Each cluster consisted of three 
permanent sampling plots at 50-ft intervals along a transect 
line. Of the 45 plots in each pasture, 24 of the thinned and 
27 of the unthinned were burned. 
Litter was recorded as present or absent at 0.5-ft intervals 
along fifteen 
100-ft transect lines between the permanent 
herbage sampling clusters. 
Green material 
from the four 
principal 
native forage 
species was collected seven times on burned and adjacent 
unburned areas from 1967 through 1969 for analysis of crude 
protein, phosphorus, and in vitro digestibility. 
Crude pro- 
tein and phosphorus were determined by standard methods 
(AOAC, 1960) and dry-matter digestibility was determined 
hy the two-stage 
in vitro technique 
(Pearson, 1969). Each 
species sample was a composite of material from approxi- 
ma tely 10 plants. 
Results 
and Discussion 
Tree Density 
The 
crown fire essentially 
eliminated 
the entire 
living pine stand on the unthinned 
area (Table 
1). 
The 
only surviving 
trees were on a rocky 
knoll. 
On the other 
hand, 
there 
were no significant 
re- 
ductions 
in tree density (basal area or canopy cover) 
after the ground fire in the thinned 
stand, although 
tree boles were scorched 
several ft high and needle

kill averaged 
54%. 
Herman 
(1954) concluded 
that 
neither 
height 
of 
bark 
scorch 
nor 
presence 
of 
nearby fuels is related 
to tree survival. 
In the Wild 
Bill 
Fire, 
temperatures 
were high 
enough 
in the 
crowns to kill but not to ignite the needles. 
Unless 
needles 
are killed 
above 
the point 
of maximum 
crown width, 
a tree can sustain 
heavy needle 
kill 
without 
affecting 
its canopy cover. 
Tree 
Diameter 
Diameter 
growth 
of ponderosa 
pines 
on 
the 
thinned 
pasture 
was strongly 
correlated 
with per- 
cent of crown 
kill 
(Fig. 
1). 
Before 
thinning, 
the 
30 sample 
trees had an average 
ring width 
of 1.2 
mm (Table 
2). Trees 
that lost 50% or less of their 
live crown 
in the fire subsequently 
averaged 
4.3 
mm annual 
radial growth, with a minimum 
of 3.0. 
Trees 
that lost 65 to 80% of their crown grew at an 
average 
rate 
of 1.4 mm-just 
slightly 
more 
than 
their prethinning 
rate-while 
trees with 85 to 9571, 
kill averaged 
only 0.6 mm. 
Previous 
pruning 
studies 
indicated 
that up to 
40yo of the live crown could be removed 
without 
significantly 
affecting 
diameter 
growth 
if at least 
30% 
of the total 
tree height 
is left in live crown 
(Heidmann, 
1963). 
In our study, radial 
growth of 
all trees with 60yo or less crown kill surpassed 
the 
average 
growth 
rate 
after 
thinning. 
Trees 
with 
20yo or less crown kill grew at nearly 
twice their 
post-thinning 
rate.

Trees 
respond 
to release, 
reduced 
competition, 
and to increased 
nutrients. 
Ponderosa 
pines, how- 
ever, 
do not 
always 
respond 
immediately 
to re- 
lease 
(Schubert, 
1971). 
Therefore, 
growth 
mea- 
sured 
after 
the fire 
included 
one or two annual 
rings when the trees were still growing 
at or near 
their before-thinning 
rate. 
The 
reduction 
of com- 
petition 
and the possible 
improvement 
in the soil 
nutrient 
level 
may also account 
for part 
of the 
higher 
growth rate following 
the burn. 
Litter 
Litter 
coverage 
on both burned 
areas was about 
the same immediately 
after the burn, although 
the 
unthinned

had more

3).

The 
unthinned 
stand in which the fire crowned, 
did not have the 
needle 
foliage 
necessary 
to increase 
coverage 
of 
ground 
litter. 
Total Herbage 
Total 
herbage 
production 
increased 
slightly 
on 
both unthinned 
and thinned 
pastures the first grow- 
ing 
season 
after 
the 
fire 
(Table 
4). 
Total 
pro- 
duction 
continued 
to increase 
the second growing 
season on the unthinned 
area but decreased 
on the 
thinned 
area. 
Grass 
Production 
of grass 
and 
grasslike 
plants 
was 
higher 
the first year after fire where exotic 
grasses 
were seeded than on unseeded 
areas. 
The 
second 
year, 
production 
of grass and grasslike 
plants 
in- 
creased 
12 times more 
than the previous 
year on 
seeded areas, but only about six times more on the 
unseeded 
areas. 
Duvall 
and Linnartz 
(1967) 
found 
fire did not 
greatly influence 
grass production 
in southern 
pine 
forests. 
They 
attributed 
a short-period 
increase 
in 
production 
on an ungrazed 
paddock 
to reduction 
of needle litter; 
apparently 
heavy accumulations 
of 
litter 
smothered 
the 
grass 
production. 
In 
the 
present study the removal 
of litter by fire from the 
thinned 
pasture 
apparently 
provided 
opportunity 
for more 
grass production. 
Forbs 
Forb production 
was greater on the thinned 
than 
on the unthinned 
pasture during 
the first growing 
season after the fire, but it did not hold this superi- 
ority (Table 
4). During 
the second growing season, 
forb production 
on the unthinned 
was more than 
triple 
the amount 
on the thinned 
pasture. 
Shrubs 
Shrub 
and half-shrub 
seedlings 
were more 
nu- 
merous and current 
twig and leaf production 
was 
higher 
after burning. 
Shrubs 
such as Fendler 
cea- 
nothus 
increased 
on both unthinned 
and thinned 
burned 
pastures. 
Ceanothus 
seeds, which 
lie dor- 
mant 
in the 
litter 
for 
years, 
germinate 
rapidly

browse 
forage was reduced 
for 2 years after burning 
while

although 
no change

Forage 
Quality 
Crude protein, 
phosphorus, 
and in vitro digesti- 
bility 
were higher 
in the forages from the burned 
area the first gowing 
season (Table 
5). 
Increases 
in digestibility 
and phosphorus 
lasted through 
the 
second 
growing 
season, 
while 
increases 
in protein 
lasted only the initial 
growing 
season following 
the 
wildfire. 
Lay (1957) 
indicated 
a similar 
improve- 
ment 
in protein 
and 
phosphorus 
following 
pre- 
scribed 
burning 
of southern 
pine forests. 
Summary 
Ponderosa 
pine 
canopy 
reduction 
resulted 
in 
more forage for livestock 
or wildlife. 
Fire enhanced 
germination 
of Fendler 
ceanothus, 
a good wildlife 
species, 
and forb 
and grass production 
increased. 
Seeding 
the burn 
with orchardgrass 
and interme- 
diate wheatgrass 
improved 
grass production 
signifi- 
cantly. 
Forage 
quality 
was improved 
temporarily 
after 
the burning. 
The 
wildfire 
destroyed 
nearly 
all trees in an unthinned 
pasture, 
but caused little 
reduction 
in tree density 
in a heavily 
thinned 
pas- 
ture. 
Pines with 60yo or less crown kill grew faster 
while those with over 60y0 crown kill grew slower 
than 
their 
preburn 
rate.
