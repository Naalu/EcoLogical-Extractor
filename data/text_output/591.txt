Precision of Reconstructed Reference Data in
Ponderosa Pine Forests of Northern Arizona

Abstract
Forest structural reference conditions are widely used to
understand how ecosystems have been altered and guide
restoration and management objectives. We used six
stem-mapped permanent plots established in the early
twentieth century to provide precise structural reference
conditions for ponderosa pine forests of northern Arizona
prior to Euro-American settlement. Reference conditions
for these plots in 1873–1874 included the following histori-
cal attributes: tree densities of 45–127 trees/ha, mean tree
diameter at breast height (dbh) of 43.8 cm with a corre-
sponding quadratic mean diameter range of 41.5–51.3 cm,
and a stand basal area of 9.2–18.0 m2/ha. The recon-
structed diameter distributions (for live ponderosa pine
trees with dbh ‚9.14 cm) prior to ﬁre exclusion varied in
shape but generally displayed an irregular unimodal distri-
bution. We suggest that management objectives for the
structural restoration of ponderosa pine forests of north-
ern Arizona emphasize: (1) conservation and retention of
all pre-settlement (>130 years) trees; (2) reduction of tree
densities with a restoration objective ranging between 50
and 150 trees/ha having a large-tree component between
25 and 50% of the total trees per hectare, respectively; (3)
manipulation of the diameter distribution to achieve a un-
imodal or irregular, uneven-aged shape (possibly target-
ing a balanced, uneven-aged shape on cinder soil types)
through the use of harvest and thinning practices that
mimic gap disturbances (i.e., individual tree selection sys-
tem); and (4) retention of 3–11 snags and logs per hectare
resulting from natural mortality.

Introduction
Assessing forest conditions prior to Euro-American and
Hispanic settlement in the Southwest is essential to
understanding the ecosystem’s historical natural range of
variability and the factors that have inﬂuenced change
over time (Fule´ et al. 1997; Landres et al. 1999; Moore
et al. 1999; Taylor 2004). Restoration projects in pon-
derosa pine forests have assumed that forest reference
conditions provide important information for maintain-
ing sustainable ecosystem structure and function as well
as reducing the risk of wildﬁres and insect or disease
epidemics (Swanson et al. 1994; Allen et al. 2002). In
contemporary forests that have been degraded so that
current conditions are outside their range of natural vari-
ability, reference conditions may serve to guide restora-
tion silvicultural treatments (Harrod et al. 1999; Moore
et al. 1999; Swetnam et al. 1999). Therefore, identiﬁca-
tion of suitable reference conditions is considered an
essential step in the ecosystem restoration planning pro-
cess (Covington et al. 1997).
Pre-settlement ponderosa pine forest structure descrip-
tions for northern (see Table 1 for examples) Arizona are
based on either historical ecology techniques (Egan &
Howell 2001), including written and oral records (e.g., Beale
1858), photographs (e.g., Swetnam et al. 1999; Kaufmann
et al. 2001), and early forest inventories (e.g., Lang & Stew-
art 1910, unpublished report), or dendrochronological stud-
ies (e.g., Fule´ et al. 1997). Cultural accounts and early
inventories only provide a general context, which rarely
translates into viable management objectives and cannot be
expected to fully characterize forest structure by contempo-
rary scientiﬁc standards. Dendrochronological techniques
have been applied with more success (e.g., White 1985;
Covington & Moore 1994a; Covington et al. 1997; Fule´ et al.
1997; Mast et al. 1999; Waltz et al. 2003). However, those
studies attempted to reconstruct pre-settlement structure
over a century of forest change, requiring coarse assumptions
to ﬁll signiﬁcant information gaps over such long periods of
time.
The objective of this study was to improve the precision
of reconstructed reference conditions using data from the
oldest forest permanent plots in the Southwest. The speciﬁc
research questions addressed in this study were as follows:

Methods
General Description of Historical Plots
The oldest forest permanent plots in the Southwest were
established between 1909 and 1913 to quantify growth and
mortality rates at both the individual tree and the stand
level in order to understand the effects of harvesting and
slash disposal practices on the natural regeneration of
ponderosa pine (Woolsey 1911, 1912; Pearson 1923, 1933).
Additional
mechanisms
inﬂuencing
regeneration
and
stand dynamics that were initially examined using these
plots included various levels of herbaceous competition
and shade effects, soil type, and both natural and anthro-
pogenic disturbances (e.g., livestock grazing, ﬁre, light-
ning, herbivory, pests) (Pearson 1950). These permanent
plots are described in detail by Moore et al. (2004), who
quantiﬁed forest structural (tree density, size, spatial
arrangement, and age) and compositional changes be-
tween plot establishment and contemporary remeasure-
ment throughout Arizona and New Mexico.

We examined six of these historical plots for this study,
all of which are located in the ponderosa pine forests on
the Coconino National Forest within a 20 km radius of
Flagstaff, Arizona (Fig. 1). Plot naming convention fol-
lowed the original identiﬁcation system that used a combi-
nation of letters and numbers representing the Fort
Valley Experimental Forest silvicultural unit (S1, S2, etc.)
and individual permanent plot designations (A, B, etc.).
Plots were located within areas where timber sales had
recently occurred (ideally within 5 years) and were 2–6 ha
(5–15 acres) in size (Woolsey 1912). Initial harvesting
treatments ranged considerably and included a commercial
selection harvest in 1894 (S1A and S1B), several relatively
light group selection harvests in 1909 (S4A and S4B) and
1913 (S5B3), and a seed tree harvest in 1913 (S5B3). Col-
lectively, the vegetation units that encompass these sites
represent 98,000 ha (12%) of Coconino National Forest
(Miller et al. 1995) and are primarily ponderosa pine with
some (<10% of the contemporary basal area) Gambel oak
(Quercus gambelii Nutt.). The soils, derived from Tertiary
basalt ﬂows and cinders, are classiﬁed as a complex of ﬁne,
smectitic Typic Argiborolls, Mollic Eutroboralfs, and
some Lithic Argiborolls, primarily with clay loam and
stony clay textures (Kerns et al. 2003) and, in the case of
the S4s, are covered by black volcanic cinders. All plots,
except for S4A and S4B, were fenced at the time of their
establishment to prevent livestock grazing. Additional
physical characteristics (e.g., elevation) are summarized in
Table 1.
Field and Laboratory Methods
Historical (1909–1913) and contemporary (1999–2004)
ﬁeld methods for measuring these plots are described by
Moore et al. (2004). Additional ﬁeld measurements col-
lected for this study included: diameter at soil surface (dss;
average of three measurements), bark thickness at dss,
and tree increment cores at breast height (1.37 m above
ground). We mounted, surfaced, and cross-dated these
cores
using
standard
dendrochronological
techniques
(Swetnam & Dieterich 1985; Stokes & Smiley 1996). We
counted tree rings on cores that could not be cross-dated,
especially in the case of younger trees. Where pith was
missed, we estimated the additional years to the tree’s pith
with a pith locator (Applequist 1958). Finally, we applied
the proportional method proposed by Bakker (2005) to
adjust past tree sizes estimated through increment cores.
We used ledger data and detailed stem maps that pre-
cisely noted the location of structures recorded at plot
establishment, as well as contemporary data measured
from the same plots. We used these precise data on tree
size, condition, location, and so forth, to reconstruct tree
and stand conditions to pre-settlement times (described
below).

Reconstructing Pre-Settlement Forest Structure
We reconstructed forest structure using data collected at
plot establishment and modeled stand conditions back-
ward from that point, ﬁrst to a date immediately prior to
initial harvest and then in discrete 5-year periods ending
at a date prior to the disruption of the natural ﬁre regime.
Initial harvests coincided with plot establishment (1909 of
the S4s and 1913 for the S5s) for all plots except S1A and
S1B (harvested in 1894 but plots established in 1909).
Because the date of the earliest ﬁre exclusion reported in
the literature for the areas surrounding these plots ranged
from 1876 to 1892 (Dieterich & Swetnam 1984; Van
Horne & Fule´ 2006), we chose 1873 for S5B2 and S5B3
and 1874 for the other four plots. We selected these dates
to: (1) ensure that we could reconstruct plots S1A and
S1B in 1894 (year of initial harvesting); (2) facilitate the
use of the historical ledger data, which were collected in
discrete 5-year intervals; and (3) avoid interpolating
between two separate reconstruction dates.
To perform the stand reconstructions, the following
model assumptions were made as follows:
(1) Seedlings that established between the inception of ﬁre
exclusion (1870s) and plot establishment (1909–1913)
would not have grown to be larger than 9.14 cm, the
minimum diameter at breast height (dbh) measured at
plot establishment, nor signiﬁcantly competed with
(altered the growth of) other established trees on those
plots. These assumptions are supported by Cormier
(1990) who found that seedlings took an average of 14
years to reach a height of 1.37 m above ground on
limestone soils and by Krauch (1933) who reported
slow diameter growth of small trees on basalt soils.
(2) Where the initial harvest occurred before plot establish-
ment (S1A and S1B), we had to adjust the growth rate
of the trees that were not harvested in 1894. We had to
slow the growth rate of these trees from 1894 to plot
establishment (1909). We had to assume a growth rate
as if the harvest had not occurred, and as if these trees
still grew in competition from higher tree densities.
Southwestern ponderosa pine trees released from com-
petition by harvest or other factors often have faster
growth rates (Schubert 1971; Ronco et al. 1985; Ffolliott
et al. 2000). This step was necessary so that we obtained
reasonable back-growth estimates, when we grew the
trees backward to a date prior to ﬁre exclusion.
(3) The rate of tree mortality remained constant over the
approximately 35-year period between the early 1870s
and plot establishment. That is, dead trees (snags and
logs) at plot establishment were the result of mortality
rates within the natural historical range. These as-
sumptions are supported by the mortality
rates
reported by Fule´ et al. (2001) at the Gus Pearson Nat-
ural Area (GPNA) (<0.5 m2hadecade) from 1920 to
1950 and by Harrington (1996) and Chambers and
Mast (2005) who observed no statistical differences in
snag fall rates between size classes on sites in the San
Juan and Kaibab National Forests, respectively. Fur-
thermore, we realize that the mortality rates reported
in the literature are based on post-settlement data,
but they are the best available.
(4) All tree structures (e.g., live trees, snags, stumps, logs)
present at plot establishment were tallied by the ﬁeld
crews, and there were no errors in the original ledger
and stem map data.
We reconstructed the number and size of ponderosa
pine trees prior to the 1909 harvest on S4A and S4B and
the 1913 harvest on plots S5B2 and S5B3 by estimating
the dbh of trees cut at that harvest, which we added to the
live trees recorded at plot establishment. Reconstruc-
tion prior to the 1894 harvesting on plots S1A and S1B
required that we estimate the 1894 dbh of live trees
recorded at plot establishment (1909) and the dbh of trees
harvested in 1894 plus others that may have died between
1894 and 1909. From that point backward, we recreated
forest structure on all plots by estimating the dbh of all
live trees, including those that may have died between
each modeled 5-year period. Estimates for dead trees such
as stumps, snags, logs, and so forth, are described below.
To estimate the dbh of harvested trees, we used current
evidence consisting of those trees’ stumps in one of four
decomposition classes (Maser et al. 1979). We developed
a regression function of dbh versus dss based on trees that
were alive at plot establishment and in 2004. Although
a large amount of stump evidence is still on the ground,
we had to estimate the dss of some stumps due to ad-
vanced decomposition. When available, we used bark
rings, sapwood, immovable rocks, and mapped records of
stump diameter (only for sites S5B2 and S5B3) to obtain
precise estimates of past tree size. We based back-estimation
of tree dbh on pre- and postharvest regression functions of
5-year periodic basal area increment versus dbh of tree at
the start of that 5-year period. To capture plot ecological
characteristics that affect growth, we built separate pre-
harvest
regression
functions
for
S1A/S1B,
S4A/S4B,
and S5B2/S5B3 and one combined postharvest function
for plots S1A/S1B. These regression functions were built
using data collected from trees present at both plot estab-
lishments and contemporarily.
Because fall and decomposition rates for snags and logs
are poorly understood (Harmon et al. 1986; Fule´ et al.
1997; Mast et al. 1999), we used applied probability to
assign death dates to snags and logs so that structures
whose death was after ﬁre exclusion would be treated as
live trees and thus returned to the live tree population.
Once we added these trees to the live tree population, we
estimated their past size using the regression functions
outlined above. To model this back-revival process, we
sampled contemporary snags and logs to estimate their
death dates (within 5 years) using notes on tree deaths
from the ledger records. Given the contemporary condi-
tion of snags and logs, and the ledger recorded death date,
we assessed the number of 5-year time steps since death.

We then used a geometric distribution to describe these
discrete, independent observations of the number of 5-
year time steps since death for snags or logs and obtained
maximum likelihood estimates of the corresponding popu-
lation parameters (denoted psnags for snags and plogs for
logs) for each geometric distribution. In general, these
population parameters quantify the probability that a snag
or log was a live tree 5 years earlier. For individual snags
and logs recorded at plot establishment, we determined
the death dates by randomly drawing an observation of
the number of 5-year time steps since death from the cor-
responding geometric distribution with parameter psnags
or plogs and assigning it to that structure. To assess the
effect on pre-settlement forest reconstructions of assigning
death dates at random and applying a speciﬁc back-growth
equation, we carried out a sensitivity analysis by running
100 simulations of the reconstruction model using upper
and lower interval estimated values for the geometric dis-
tribution parameters and the predicted previous 5-year
basal area increment.
Results
All linear regressions predicting past trees sizes (back-
growth equations) and dbh from dss provided good ﬁts as
judged by the distribution of residuals (Table 2). The lin-
ear regression coefﬁcients used for predicting past 5-year
basal area growth had a smaller intercept and steeper
slope for both S1A and S1B prior to harvest.
We estimated maximum likelihood estimates of the
geometric distribution population parameter derived from
samples of the number of 5-year time steps since death for
the snags and logs at plot establishment as psnags ¼ 0.066
(SE ¼ 0.014, n ¼ 22) and plogs ¼ 0.059 (SE ¼ 0.012,
n ¼ 21), respectively. For example, a random sample
(i.e., number of ﬁre-year time steps since death) from the
resulting snag population would then have an expected
value of 1/psnags or the 15.2 ﬁve-year time steps (75.8
years). As expected, the mean number of years since
death for logs was larger (84.5 years).
Pre-Settlement Forest Structure
Pre-settlement forest structure for live and dead trees is
summarized in Table 1 (plots arranged by increasing num-
ber of live trees per hectare). Averages for live trees across
all plots were as follows: trees per hectare: 81.7 (SD ¼ 27.8),
dbh: 43.8 cm (SD ¼ 4.1), and stand basal area: 14.1 m2/ha
(SD ¼ 3.2). Dead structures yielded the following esti-
mates: snags per hectare: 1.6 (SD ¼ 1.1) and logs per hect-
are: 3.1 (SD ¼ 3.1), resulting in a reconstructed mean of
4.7 dead structures per hectare.
The reconstructed partial dbh distributions (for live
ponderosa pine trees with dbh 9.14 cm) at the time prior
to ﬁre exclusion (Fig. 2) varied in shape but generally
displayed either a unimodal (S1B, S1A, S4B, S5B2, and
S5B3) or possibly an irregular inverse J-shaped (S4A)
distribution (Schubert 1974; Harrington 1982). The sensi-
tivity analysis showed that reconstructed diameter distri-
butions in 1873–1874 were robust (Fig. 2—error bars), and
live tree density varied by no more than 0.5 tree/ha across
all sites. Sensitivity analysis also revealed that the recon-
structed estimates of stand basal area were most sensitive
to the growth model of S4A and S4B, where estimates var-
ied as much as 2.5% (almost equal to 1 m2/ha). As
expected, precision in reconstructed diameter distribu-
tions decreased as tree density increased and was lowest
in the 40–50 cm dbh classes. Plots S5B2 and S5B3, which
had the smallest extent (1.21 ha), were generally most sen-
sitive to assigning death dates at random, especially in the
30–50 cm dbh classes.
Data suggested that reference conditions for pre-
settlement snag densities ranged from 0.3 (S1B) to 2.9

(S5B2) snags per hectare and were highly variable. The
maximum dead tree (snags and logs) density was 11 dead
trees per hectare on plot S5B3. Pre-settlement log densi-
ties consistently increased with live tree densities and
ranged from 1.2 (S4B) to 9.4 (S5B3) trees per hectare.
Average reconstructed dbh of both snags and downed
trees was larger than the average reconstructed live tree
dbh, with the increase in size being as much as 26 cm
(S1B).
Discussion
Our forest reconstruction model yielded more precise struc-
tural reference conditions for ponderosa pine forests in
northern Arizona because we were able to: (1) use data
from historical permanent plots and (2) reconstruct forest
structure over a relatively short period of time (<40 years;
1873–1874 to 1909–1913). These reconstructed forest struc-
tural conditions may, in turn, be used to validate other den-
drochronological
reconstruction
approaches,
serve
as
baseline for comparisons of contemporary conditions, and
provide guidance in determining forest structural restora-
tion objectives.
Pre-Settlement Forest Structure
It is commonly reported that southwestern ponderosa pine
stands exhibited the classic reverse-J diameter distribution
(Nyland 1996) typical of a balanced, uneven-aged struc-
ture (size distribution) prior to Euro-American settlement
(Rietveld 1978; Savage 1991; Bailey & Covington 2002).
However, we did not generally ﬁnd that structural charac-
teristic, except possibly on plot S4A, showed some resem-
blance to a balanced structure. Results for S4A were
expected because that plot is located on a cinder soil that
causes harsh site conditions for seedlings, yet tends to pre-
serve adequate growing space and often supports multiple
size classes (O’Hara 1998) while consistently having low
tree mortality rates (Krauch 1930, 1933; Pearson 1939).
The size distributions of the other plots are best character-
ized as unimodal even though they are likely uneven aged
whose structure at the time of reconstruction resulted
from a gap-type disturbance (Cooper 1960, 1961; White
1985; Fule´ et al. 2002). Without corresponding age data,
inferences of age distribution shape are speculative; how-
ever, our speculations are supported by studies conducted
at the nearby GPNA where age data were obtained
(White 1985; Mast et al. 1999).

The notion that these stand structures are dependent
upon gap-type disturbances is not new in southwestern
ponderosa pine forests. In these systems, seedling pulses
are known to have established in small forest openings
(Cooper 1960, 1961; White 1985; Stephens & Fry 2005;
Sa´nchez Meador et al. accepted) and were subsequently
thinned by frequent surface ﬁres (Biswell et al. 1973;
White 1985). Also, based on the seedling and sapling den-
sities reported in the literature (Savage 1991; Bailey &
Covington 2002; Waltz et al. 2003), it seems improbable
that pine seedling densities needed to produce a balanced,
uneven-aged diameter distribution (over 50 additional trees
per hectare in the 0–30 cm classes) could have become
established under the pre-settlement frequent ﬁre regime
(White 1985; Fule´ et al. 1997; Mast et al. 1999). In addition,
it is unlikely that smaller trees (9.14 cm) would have
experienced lower mortality rates prior to ﬁre exclusion
than that observed under contemporary conditions, espe-
cially in light of the remarkable persistence of small trees in
the absence of ﬁre (White 1985; Moore et al. 2004).
Large woody debris such as snags and logs play an
important role in wildlife habitats (Raphael & White
1984; Laudenslayer 1997; Bate et al. 1999; Chambers &
Mast 2005), nutrient cycling and carbon dynamics in forest
ecosystems (Harmon et al. 1986; Hart 1999), as well as
ﬁre behavior and insect outbreaks (Spies et al. 1988;
Covington & Moore 1994a, 1994b). Although based on
a small sample size (n ¼ 6), we found a similar mean time
since death for snags to that reported by Waskiewicz et al.
(2007) for clean bark snags (69 years). We also found that
log densities increased with stand density, reﬂecting a simi-
lar association to that observed in contemporary condi-
tions (Moore et al. 2004).
Given that the Woolsey plots were established before
the concept of randomization became the norm in sam-
pling studies, questions may arise as to how representative
those plots were of other ponderosa pine forests in north-
ern Arizona. Bell et al. (2008) studied this issue and found
evidence that the Woolsey plots were historically repre-
sentative of forested lands within the terrestrial ecosystem
units (Miller et al. 1995) to which those plots belong.
Comparisons to Other Reconstruction Studies
The estimated average pre-settlement pine densities on
the historical plots used in this study ranged between 45
and 127 live trees per hectare, whereas Covington and
Moore (1994a) found an average of 43 pines/ha at Bar M
Canyon, Mast et al. (1999) reported 61 pines/ha at GPNA,
and Waltz et al. (2003) found 62 pines/ha in the Grand
Canyon National Park. The 66 pines/ha reported by Fule´
et al. (1997) as pre-settlement pine density for the Camp
Navajo Army Depot site (Bellemont, AZ) is from a
pine–Gambel oak forest having a total (all species) pre-
settlement density of 149 trees/ha, which included 80
trees/ha of Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), 3 trees/ha of
Juniper (Juniperus spp.), and 1 tree/ha of White ﬁr (Abies
concolor). Therefore, dendrochronological reconstruction
methods (e.g., Fule´ et al. 1997; Huffman et al. 2001) pro-
duced pre-settlement tree density estimates that lie within
results found in this study.
Pre-settlement forest structure for our study area also fell
within the range of 40–255 pines/ha reported in several
early national forest inventories and other studies in
the region (see Table 3 for comparisons). In particular,
Woolsey (1911) reported a mean of 40 pines greater than
or equal to 15.24 cm dbh per hectare on ‘‘average’’ stands
in timber sale areas on the Coconino National Forest and a
mean density of 86 pines greater than or equal to 9.14 cm
dbh per hectare on ‘‘maximum’’ stands, which was slightly
higher than the 81 trees/ha greater than or equal to 9.14 cm
dbh presented in this study. Woolsey (1911) also included
sites located on limestone soils, which were found to sup-
port higher tree densities than those derived from basalt
parent material. Tree densities reported in those early
inventories are valuable for understanding changes that
have taken place in these forests. However, those results
are of limited value as reference conditions because early
inventories were conducted on harvested stands and after
the onset of ﬁre exclusion and intensive livestock grazing.
As expected, our reconstructed densities are signiﬁ-
cantly lower than contemporary densities reported by
Moore et al. (2004). Our average estimated density (81.4
trees/ha) was almost 16% of the mean contemporary den-
sity (514 trees/ha), and even our densest reconstructed
plot (S5B3, 
X: 126.3 trees/ha) was less than 25% than
average current density.
Only a few historical surveys report snag data in ponder-
osa pine forests, quantiﬁed as percentages of either volume
(Lang & Stewart 1910) or total tree density (Leiberg et al.
1904), and none report downed tree densities or actual ref-
erence conditions. Although Mast et al. (1999) sampled
dead structures in their dendrochronological study, prob-
lems with determining death dates (due to decayed sap-
wood) prevented determination of whether the structures
were alive or dead before the inception of ﬁre exclusion.
Our 1873–1874 reconstructions of dead tree structures
were slightly lower than those reported by Mast et al. (1999).
Even our maximum estimate of total pre-settlement snags
and logs (combined) of 11 dead trees per hectare for S5B3
was lower than the 13 dead trees per hectare reported by
Mast et al. (1999) for their GPNA site.
Management Implications
Managing ecosystems that have been highly altered by
past land use activities remains a major challenge for land
managers responsible for southwestern ponderosa pine
forests. In northern Arizona, recent forest management
projects have focused on the reduction of hazardous fuels
and the improvement and conservation of wildlife habitat.
Although restoration of forest structure still remains con-
troversial (Abella et al. 2006), restoration as an objective
has received less attention. Historical forest inventories and

dendrochronological reconstructions provide a range of
quantitative estimates of pre-settlement forest structural
conditions that are meant to serve as a basis for ecosystem
management and as guides when planning restoration goals.
Results from this study, as well as other dendrochrono-
logical studies, are useful for determining forest structure
and ﬁre regime reference conditions. However, land manag-
ers must realize that reference conditions presented in the
literature are site speciﬁc and are based on limited spatial
extents and sample sizes and, therefore, will deviate on sites
with different soils, parent material, and historical land use.
In a forest management context, reference conditions serve
as a foundation, or reference point, by which trade-offs of
additional management objectives should be evaluated and/
or selected, rather than as a rigid target that deﬁnes the out-
come or success of a restoration project (Kaufmann et al.
1994; Harrod et al. 1999; Landres et al. 1999; Moore et al.
1999; Allen et al. 2002). Therefore, strict interpretation and
application of reference conditions should be avoided,
allowing for the incorporation of additional management
objectives or known mechanisms of change, such as climate.
Based on reconstructed pre-settlement and contempo-
rary conditions, we suggest that structural restoration
objectives emphasize: (1) conservation and retention of all
pre-settlement (>130 years) trees because these trees are
the main missing component in contemporary forests
structure; (2) reduction of tree densities with a restoration
objective ranging between 50 and 150 trees/ha having
a large-tree component between 25 and 50% of the total
trees per hectare, respectively; (3) manipulation of the
diameter distribution to achieve a unimodal or irregular,
uneven-aged shape (possibly targeting a balanced, uneven-
aged shape on cinder soil types) through the use of harvest
and thinning that mimic gap disturbances (i.e., individual
tree selection system); and (4) retention of 3–11 snags and
logs per hectare resulting from natural mortality. In addi-
tion, restoration projects should use ecosystem manage-
ment principles and consider long-term (over multiple
decades) assessment of success because many ponderosa
pine sites do not currently support forest structures that
match restoration objectives in the short term.
Implications for Practice
d A combination of dendrochronological and repeat
forest inventory approaches is recommended for
evaluating changes of forest structure at annual and
decadal scales (Biondi 1999).
d If you have historical stand structure information,
you should use it. The foresters from the early 1900s
were well trained and kept precise records. These
data might be located in your district or forest ar-
chives or at regional National Archives and Records
Administration ofﬁce. Continuous Forest Inventory
or Forest Inventory and Analysis inventory data
might be useful for the past 50–60 year records.
d We recommend that you use dendrochronological
techniques if you want to reconstruct the stand to
a time prior to ﬁre exclusion or livestock grazing.
d Reconstructed forest structural conditions derived
from dendrochronological techniques and historical
forest inventories can be used to validate other den-
drochronological reconstruction approaches, serve as
baseline for comparisons of contemporary condi-
tions, and provide essential guidance in determining
forest structural restoration objectives.
