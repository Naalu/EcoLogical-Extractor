Shaded fuelbreak treatments involve removal of understory brush and small-diameter
trees to reduce ﬁre hazards by disconnecting the continuity of fuels. As a result of these
treatments, woody biomass (referred to as slash) is piled throughout the treated stand and
later burned. Mechanical removal of slash has not been successfully implemented in many
areas due to limited accessibility to sites and the high costs associated with collection and
transportation of slash. To address these issues, a roll-off truck paired with a small skid-
steer loader was used to collect and transport slash to a centralized processing site
where slash was ground as hog fuel for energy production. ‘‘Roll-off truck’’ refers to
a straight frame truck conﬁguration in which a 30.6-m3 container is rolled onto and off the
straight frame truck by means of a truck-mounted winch system. This study was designed
to quantify the operational performance and costs of removing slash piles using a roll-off
trucking system in mountainous conditions in northern California. The overall cost to
collect and haul hand-piled slash was $26.81/tonne with 22% average moisture content or
$34.37/bone dry metric ton. The roll-off trucking system should be used primarily for short
hauling distances since trucking costs signiﬁcantly increase with small increases in
hauling distance due to slow traveling speeds and low slash weight being hauled. Financial
analysis indicated that contractors can receive high rates of return on their invested capital
after accounting for inﬂation and income taxes, but limited work opportunities are
a concern for them.

Introduction
A fuelbreak is a strategically located wide block, or strip, on
which a cover of dense, heavy, or ﬂammable vegetation has
been changed to one of lower fuel volume or reduced ﬂam-
mability [4]. Shaded fuelbreaks are often created by altering
surface fuels, increasing the height to the base of live crowns,
and opening the canopy by removing trees [1]. This practice
has been commonly implemented on National Forests in
northern California to break up the continuity of fuels,
improve ﬁreﬁghter safety, and conﬁne wildﬁres to one
watershed area. In mixed conifer vegetation types, a high level
of crown closure (typically around 60%) is recommended in
order to reduce re-growth of brush and small trees after the
treatments. Chainsaws are often used to fell brush and small
trees (<20.32 cm in diameter at breast height) and cut them
into small pieces for hand-piling. Piles of woody biomass
(called ‘‘slash’’ hereafter) are placed throughout the treated

stand, with adequate spacing to reduce residual stand damage
from pile burning. These piles are subsequently consumed by
burning when weather conditions and the slash moisture
content are within speciﬁed prescriptions.
Burning slash piles is a commonly used fuel treatment
practice, but it is associated with several concerns including
smoke production, residual tree mortality, and the risk of ﬁre
escape. These concerns limit the number of burning days,
which often delays the completion of the fuel treatment and
subsequent forest management activities. Furthermore it can
cost $370–$2100/ha to implement, depending on the amount
of fuel and the characteristics (species, size, and arrangement)
of slash piles to be burned (Curran, 2008; personal communi-
cation, USDA Forest Service, California).
As an alternative to pile burning, mechanical removal of
slash piles has been considered to avoid the negativeeffects and
constraints associated with slash burning. At the same time it
can also create opportunities to utilize slash to produce energy
and bio-basedproducts. Slash can begroundintohog fuelwhich
is transported using wood chip vans to cogeneration/power
plants to produce steam heat and/or electricity. Hog fuel is
a term describing biomass fuel that has been processed by
a mechanical shredder or grinder and is normally used as a fuel
source for heat or energy production. It is a whole-tree product
that includes bark, leaves, and stem wood.
Slash utilization can also include forest residues resulting
from commercial thinning and timber harvesting operations.
However, this approach has not been well implemented on
a practical level because of limited accessibility on forest
roads and the high costs associated with collection and
transportation of these materials [5]. Typical slash recovery
operations for energy production use a grinder and chip vans.
These machines are brought to landings if chip vans can
access these locations. Forest roads in the western US are built
for hauling logs using stinger-steered logging trucks, and
a typical chip van has limited access to harvesting sites due to
sharp curves, steep grades, and low ground clearance.
Because of limited accessibility, woody biomass amounts that
can practically be supplied for utilization are substantially less
than gross forest biomass available to harvest. The annual
available biomass in California was estimated at 24.4 million
dry metric tons, but the amount that could potentially be
utilized amounts to only 13.0 million dry metric tons [8].
Besides limited accessibility for chip vans, high-cost
machines such as grinders are signiﬁcantly underutilized
since landing slash piles are small (a grinder often spends less
than one or two days grinding a pile of landing slash) and
scattered over a large area. An expensive grinder (typically
>$450,000) has to move frequently, resulting in low produc-
tion rates. Logistical arrangements such as grinding location
and hauling distance on forest roads between on-site opera-
tions and transportation to an energy plant have been a chal-
lenge as well. These difﬁculties are further complicated in
northern California where terrain is steep and roads are
typically not favorable for efﬁcient transportation.
In this study we examined an alternative method to remove
woody materials and increase accessibility to slash piled as
a result of shaded fuelbreak treatments. In particular a ‘‘roll-
off truck’’ with roll-on/off containers was tested to carry non-
merchantable material for a short distance (less than 8 km) to
a centralized processing site. ‘‘Roll-off’’ refers to a straight
frame truck conﬁguration in which modular containers are
‘‘rolled’’ onto and off of the straight frame truck by means of
a truck-mounted hydraulic winch and a hook. A previous
study indicated that a roll-off trucking system would signiﬁ-
cantly improve both accessibility to more forest residues and
economic efﬁciency of the recovering process [7]. Further
investigation is needed to broaden our knowledge for a wide
range of applications of this technology into woody biomass
collection and transportation.
The overall objective of this study was to evaluate the
economic feasibility of removing hand-piled slash using a roll-
off trucking system in mountainous conditions. Speciﬁc
research questions include: 1) how much does it cost ($/hour)
to operate the system consisting of roll-offs and a loader; 2)
what are the potential productivities (tonnes/hour) in a wide
range of work conditions for loading and transportation; 3)
what is the economic maximum hauling distance in which
a roll-off trucking system is ﬁnancially feasible; and 4) what
would it take to develop a proﬁtable business that utilizes roll-
off trucks in slash collection and transportation.

Study methods
2.1.
Study site and a roll-off trucking system
A two-week trial of removing hand-piled slash using a roll-off
trucking system was conducted on the Six Rivers National
Forest in late July, 2007 near Mad River, California. Hand-piled
slash (Fig. 1) was created by shaded fuelbreak treatments
which also maintained 60% crown closure to reduce re-growth
of brush and small trees within the understory. The shaded
fuelbreak treatment prescription required cutting brush and
suppressed understory trees less than 20.32 cm in diameter at
breast height (DBH) which contribute to ladder fuels. These
ladder fuels can allow ﬁres to carry from surface fuels into the
crowns of trees or shrubs with relative ease. The width of the
shaded fuelbreak treatment varied with topography and
vegetation but averaged 76.2 m on ridge tops and along roads.

Firewood was salvaged from the trees cut and the remaining
unmerchantable woody biomass was hand-piled for later
burning. Realizing an opportunity for biomass research,
however, a collaborative agreement was reached to collect
and transport slash piles to a central processing area using
a roll-off trucking system. Once at the processing area, slash
could be ground and transported for use at an energy plant.
The slash removal system utilized in this study consisted
of a loader and a roll-off truck equipped with roll-off
containers (Fig. 2). Containers were placed along the road-
side and loaded with slash in the woods using a small rubber
tracked skid-steer front-end loader (ASV RC100). A typical
loading cycle included unloaded travel to the slash pile,
compiling/picking-up
slash,
loaded
travel
back
to
the
container, and the subsequent loading of the container with
the slash. This particular loader was chosen for use on this
project due to its ability to travel swiftly around and without
damaging residual trees while exerting minimal ground
pressure (<27.58 kPa). The loader operator compacted the
slash in the container using the bucket to increase the slash
weight within the container. The loader is small enough to be
transported inside a container when moving to the next job,
but was carried to the work site using a large pickup truck
($40,000) and a trailer ($10,000).
A roll-off truck, utilizing its 317 kW engine, short truck
length (9.1 m) and high clearance design, can negotiate sharp
curves (w12.1 m radius) and travel on steep grades (15–20%)
where typical log trucks can travel. A trailer used to carry an
additional container (often referred to as a ‘‘pup’’) can be
pulled by the truck as well. The roll-off containers used for
this study were 2.1 m tall, 2.4 m wide, and 6.1 m length with
a capacity of 30.6 m3. Although the containers were similar,
one had a non-removable stabilizer bar over the rear doors.
With two containers, the truck can carry up to 18.2 tons of
woody biomass per trip. The truck traveled on four different
standards of roads during the study: paved highway, main
gravel, secondary gravel, and spur (Table 1). Each trucking
cycle consisted of travel to a loaded container, loading (rolling-
on)
a
container
ﬁlled
with
slash,
loaded
transport
to
a centralized processing area, dumping the slash from the
container, transporting an empty container back to the
loading area, and rolling off the empty container. Slash that
was removed during the study was compiled at a central
processing location where it was ground to hog fuel and
delivered to a local energy plant; however, this grinding phase
was not included in our study.
2.2.
Data collection and analysis
Machine rates ($/hour) for each machine were calculated using
standard methods [3,6]. Cost factors and assumptions were
collected from the contractors and summarized in Table 2.
Time and motion methods were used to collect productive and
non-productive time data for each machine. These data were
used to examine interactions between equipment, personnel,
and slash collection attributes (e.g. machine travel distance
and number of slash piles). Equipment cycle times were
recorded with one of two different stopwatches. Extremely
short cycle elements observed during the loading cycles
necessitated the use of a decimal stopwatch (hundredths of
a minute), while longer trucking cycles allowed the use of
a
conventional
stopwatch
using
minutes
and
seconds.
Working conditions such as distances, weights, residual trees
per acre, and pile size were measured and noted during each
cycle element. Delays (i.e. machine not working) that occurred
during the study were recorded and distributed within four
categories:
mechanical,
operational,
administrative,
and
personal delays. Research-related delays such as weight
measurements were excluded from the production analysis.
A portable weighing system (Intercom PT 300) was used to
measure slash weight carried in each container. The roll-off
truck and two empty containers were weighed at the central
processing site before the operation started to obtain a tare
weight. After hauling the biomass to the central processing
site, the truck and load were weighed. Weight measurements
were recorded along each of the truck’s three axles, and
summed to obtain an overall weight. The slash weight was
calculated by subtracting the empty truck weight including
a container (tare weight) from the gross loaded weight.
Truck travel distances on paved and gravel roads, as well as
at the central processing area were measured by vehicle
odometer down to 0.16 km. Distances on spur roads within the
treatment area were measured by ﬁberglass tape and/or
impulse laser. Distances were marked and ﬂagged along the
spur road for convenient identiﬁcation while collecting data.
Locations where road types changed were ﬂagged to identify
them during data collection.

Slash moisture measurements were recorded daily during
the study in order to determine the average moisture content of
the material being hauled. Data were collected for three diam-
eter size classes: small (<2.5 cm), medium (6.7–15.2 cm), and
large (>15.2 cm). Biomass was randomly selected from slash
piles within the three size classes for measurement. Moisture
sampleswere takenusing aDelmhorstBD-2100 moisturemeter.
The moisture meter sensor penetrated through the bark on
small-diameter material to measure moisture content. For
medium and large material, pieces were cut using a chainsaw to
obtain a cross-sectional area that was not exposed to ambient
air. Three measurements were taken diagonally across each
cross-sectionalarea(top, bottom, andcenter).Average moisture
content was obtained by averaging the three measurements.
Three to seven circular sample plots (0.04 ha in size) were
established on 0.2–04 ha study units to determine the average
number of piles and residual trees per hectare.
The spreadsheet program MS Excel was used to calculate
simple statistics such as individual loading cycle times, and
the number of loading cycles per loaded container. In addi-
tion, individual delay-free cycle times were calculated and
paired with measured variables (e.g., distances, trees per acre,
load size) observed during the cycle. Regression analysis was
conducted through the SAS 9.0 program to determine if vari-
ables had a signiﬁcant effect on loading and hauling produc-
tivity. Variables were considered signiﬁcant if the p-value of
the associated regression coefﬁcient was less than 0.05:
a variable which had a p-value greater than 0.05 was not
included in the regression model. Before performing multiple
regression analysis, the data were examined for outliers,
normality,
heteroscedasticity,
and
the
severity
of
multicollinearity.
Sensitivity analysis was also performed to evaluate the
maximum economic hauling distance on forest roads. This is
useful to examine when the overall cost of slash removal
becomes cost prohibitive for the Forest Service and/or private
landowners. Hauling distance also directly affects the number
of containers required to balance the workload between truck

and loader. For loading, our sensitivity analysis was focused
on residual stand density and forest travel distance to
understand how these variables affected loading productivity
and cost.
A cash ﬂow analysis that includes all the costs and revenues
was conducted to evaluate the proﬁtability of the contracting
business over the life of the machines. The ChargeOut! [2]
program was used to calculate internal rates of return, break-
even charge-out rates, and net present values. This program
also allows a user to perform sensitivity and break-even anal-
ysis to understand the business conditions that are necessary
to make the business proﬁtable, including the number of work
days, loan interest, risk premium, and charge-out rates.

Results and discussion
3.1.
Loading slash into roll-off containers
The average cycle time for the loader to make a round trip
between a container and the slash piles took 1.68 min (Table 3).
The largest time component of an average cycle time (35.7%)
was travel from the slash pile back to the container at an
average traveling distance of 35.4 m (Fig. 3). Piling represented
33.6% of the average cycle time, indicating that a different type
of grapple for the loader may be used to more efﬁciently grab
the slash pile. Residual tree density often slowed loaded and
empty
travel
time
due
to
limited
maneuverability
and
increased care needed to reduce residual stand damage. This
was particularly noticeable when the number of trees per ha
exceeded 494. In order to maximize the load volume, the
operator combined two or three piles of slash using the grapple
and bucket combination to compact and consolidate the piles.
Approximately 1/3 of the overall delay-free cycle time was
spent piling and compacting slash in the forest. Although
additional slash piling and compacting activities increased the
delay-free cycle time ( p < 0.05), this process also increased the
load size delivered to the container. Compaction of slash in the
forest occurred during 85%of thetotalcycles observed(n ¼ 891).
Since the loader had rubber tracks, there was a concern by
the operator that the tracks could be seriously damaged by
stumps left by the thinning crew. In addition to physical
damage, traveling over stumps slowed travel time since the
slash grappled was often unacceptably shaken loose. The
loader operator removed the stumps during 7.7% of the overall
cycles though it did not signiﬁcantly contribute to individual
cycle times. Although care was taken, by the end of the
operation, the tracks had been severely damaged by stumps.
The stump height should be reduced close to ground level if
this type of loader is expected to be used to remove slash.
The average weight of a load varied with the amount of
bole wood in the pile and averaged 202 kg (n ¼ 889). The
number of loading cycles needed to ﬁll a 30.6-m3 container
averaged 17.5, ranging from 13 to 26. Small limbs and
branches were difﬁcult to compact in the container and
caused lighter container loads. Areas with more bole material
had more weight and compaction was achieved primarily by
the weight of the material. Observations showed an increase
in weight of 161% between the lightest container load (limbs
and branches) and the heaviest container loaded with limbs,
tops, and bole wood. Although eight additional loading cycles
were needed to achieve this weight, the extra time spent was
justiﬁed by the increased tonnage per container.
Regression models for delay-free cycle time were devel-
oped to estimate an average loading cycle time, using the
corresponding independent variables for each cycle element
(Table 4). For the models, all the coefﬁcients were signiﬁcant
( p < 0.05) and R2 values were generally high, indicating the
average cycle time equation for loading may be effectively
used to estimate loading productivity. Ground slopes were
generally gentle (<32%) and did not signiﬁcantly affect the
average cycle time ( p > 0.05).
Dummy variables were used to examine the effect of
operators (i.e., experienced and less experienced), time for
stump removal, and different container types. All dummy
variables were signiﬁcant, indicating that a less experienced

operator and stump removal could increase delay-free average
loading cycle time. This also indicates that container type has
an effect on loading time: the container with a stabilizer bar
could not be ﬁlled as high as the container without a stabilizer
bar because the slash above the bar may cause hang-ups
delaying the slash unloading process. Although a decrease in
loading time was observed, there was an 18% decrease in
tonnage when comparing the heaviest loaded containers.
3.2.
Hauling slash to a central processing area
Once a container was loaded, the roll-off truck transported the
slash to a central processing area located 4.5 km away from
the loading site. Due to poor road conditions (i.e., steep and
sharp curves), a round trip (8.9 km) took slightly over 52 min
(Table 5). The average travel time to reach a loaded container
along the spur road was approximately 2 min with an average
travel distance of 91.4 m. At times, however, the truck had to
back over 304.8 m to reach a loaded container due to highly
limited turn-around locations on the spur road. Backing the
truck long distances (particularly over steep or uneven terrain)
could severely lower the production rate. The average total
time to drive to a loaded container, position the truck, and
load a full container was 6.79 min, representing 12.9% of the
average total cycle time.
Delays were seldom observed during the loading stage. The
truck driver was highly skilled at positioning the truck for
optimum hooking and rolling the loaded container onto the
truck. The major challenge associated with rolling-on and
rolling-off containers was the uneven terrain located adjacent
to the spur road. Uneven terrain did not allow the truck to
have even vertical alignment on each rail, which at times,
caused a container to drop off the rails (frames). When this
occurred, extra time was needed to drop the container, and
the likelihood of mechanical damage to the truck increased.
Side-slopes
should
be
avoided
when
loading/unloading
containers. As the container is raised, the truck’s center of
gravity shifts to the side, increasing the chance of a rollover.
Travel speeds on spur roads were highly limited by steep
grades and road surface conditions: the speeds on spur roads
ranged from 3.2 to 9.7 km per hour (kph). Although the roll-off
truck has almost 30-cm of ground clearance, extra time was
spent traveling over road sections that contained rolling dips.
The average time spent traveling over spur roads with a loaded
container was 3.16 min (6.0 percent of the overall cycle time).
Traveling loaded on gravel roads accounted for 25.8
percent of the overall cycle time (13.49 min) and was con-
strained by sections with steep slopes (e.g. 21% slope), and
poor road surface conditions (Table 6). Driving with a loaded
container on downhill slopes required the assistance of an
engine compression brake. Without the compression brake,
applying the air brakes on loose, 7.6-cm or smaller rocks
caused the truck to skid, lose steering ability, and caused an
overall
loss
of
vehicle
control.
Though
effective,
the
compression brake contributed to reduced speed (travel
loaded) on secondary gravel roads. Compared to the main

gravel road, the average speed on the secondary gravel road
was considerably slower due to loose surface conditions.
Field observations veriﬁed that containers with heavier
payloadsincreasedthetravelspeedonadversegravelroadsdue
to extra traction provided over the rear axles. This was partic-
ularly noticeable while traveling loaded on the main gravel
roads. This, in combination with downhill traveling (loaded),
increased the average speed on the main gravel road by 1.5 kph
(Table 6). The load capacity (weight limit) for the roll-off truck
was 9.1 tons, during the study, the slash weight per load ranged
from 1.5 to 5.0 tons, with an average of 3.3 tons per load. This
was far less than the load capability of the truck. Larger stem
material loaded on top of lighter tops and limbs would compact
the load and increase the weight (and volume) of each load.
Short travel distance on the paved road to the central pro-
cessing sitepreventedthe truck fromreachingitsnormalspeed.
For 0.56 km of asphalt pavement, the loaded roll-off truck spent
around 0.97 min with an average speed of 34.8 kph. A separate
test of asphalt pavement travel over longer distance showed
that the normal speed was around 64.4 kph. The travel speed of
the roll-off truck at the central processing site (8.0 kph) was
comparablewith the speedonthe gravelroaddue toshorttravel
distance and limited road width along with a required stop for
research related weight measurements. Traveling time on the
paved road represented 4.3% of the total cycle time.
Unloading of slash at the central processing area involved
positioning the truck at the proper location, opening the rear
doors of the container, and raising the container to allow the
biomass to slide out the back (similar to a dump truck). This
operation was heavily affected by the design of the container.
As noted previously, one of the containers had a bar on the
back which hindered the smooth ﬂow of slash out the back of
the container. Occasionally slash would get caught on this bar
preventing the slash from unloading. When this occurred,
a chainsaw was needed to release the slash, signiﬁcantly
increasing the unloading time by 10–15 min. To mitigate the
problems caused by the bar, the loader operator reduced
the amount of slash loaded in this particular container. The
average unloading time (delay-free) was 3.48 min, represent-
ing 6.7 percent of the average total cycle time.
A large central processing area is needed in order to
accommodate large amounts of slash. Each slash load deliv-
ered comprised an area approximately 2.4 m wide by 6.1 m
long after it was slid out of the roll-off container. By backing
the empty container against the recently deposited pile, this
footprint could be slightly reduced. The area should also

as a grinder, loader, and chip van.
Regression
equations
for
delay-free
trucking
cycle
elements were developed based on the data collected during
the operation and contain the variables that signiﬁcantly
affected each elemental cycle time (Table 7). These regression
models for each cycle element were combined to create
a regression equation to estimate the average round-trip
trucking time. This combined equation does not include the
time required for loading/unloading containers, dumping the
slash, and traveling all the road sections since cycle times
spent on these operations were similar each cycle. The vari-
able of ‘‘site travel empty’’ was not included in the combined
regression model due to severe multicollinearity with the
variable of ‘‘site travel loaded’’ and its insigniﬁcance ( p ¼ 0.97)
in the model.
The combined regression equation did not include the
average time of the following cycle elements; dropping off
empty containers (167 s), loading a fully loaded container
(212 s), and dumping biomass at the central processing site
(209 s). To calculate an average cycle time, a constant value of
588 s was added to the combined regression equation to reﬂect
these elements in the cycle. In addition, the time for traveling
on gravel (main and secondary) and paved roads was not
included in the combined equation because the truck traveled
over the same (i.e., ﬁxed) distances of those road sections for
every trip. The average speed for each hauling road section
(Table 6) was used to estimate travel time which should be
added to the total cycle time.
3.3.
Collection and transportation cost
The overall cost to collect and haul hand-piled slash which
resulted from shaded fuelbreak treatments was $26.81/tons or
$34.37bone dry metric ton (Table 8). Hourly cost ($/scheduled
machine hour (SMH)) for the truck was lower than the hourly
cost for the loader; however, the unit production cost ($/tonne)
was higher in trucking than loading because hourly production
rates for the truck were lower than those for the loader. This
indicates that it is important to reduce trucking distance to
minimize the overall cost. It should be noted that the average
cycle time for trucking needs to be matched with the average
cycletimefor loadingto avoideithertruck or loaderbeingidled.
The difference in cycle times between loading and hauling may
be also addressed by having multiple containers available.
Increasing hauling capacity for the truck is an option to
keep the overall operation efﬁcient. The truck is able to carry
another container on a trailer, which would bring the
combined total to 61.2 m3 each trip. For example, under the

current cycle times for loading and hauling (Tables 3 and 5), it
would be a somewhat balanced system if the truck were able
to carry two containers each trip or another truck is added to
the system since the loading time was about half of the
trucking time. Two containers could be fully loaded with slash
by the time the truck returns to the site from the central
processing area. However, considerations should be given for
extra time loading and unloading the second container and
road conditions for truck turn-arounds if the truck and trailer
option were implemented. Additionally, truck turnouts may
be required if more than one truck were used.
A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effect
of hauling distance on the total cost of slash collection and
transportation; all values of variables were ﬁxed while hauling
distances for main and secondary gravel roads were changed
on a 0.5-km increment. The regression equations developed
from this study were used to estimate productivity for loading
and trucking. The costs of roll-off trucking operations signiﬁ-
cantly increased with a small increase of hauling distance on
gravel roads due to slow traveling speeds (less than 18 kph on
gravel roads) and low carrying capacity (30.6 m3 or 3.3 tons/trip
in this study). In particular, the total slash removal cost
increased at a faster rate when hauling distance on the
secondary road increased, compared to the cost increase with
an increase of hauling distance on the main gravel road (Fig. 4).
This was mainly due to the truck’s ability to travel faster on
main gravel roads compared to secondary roads (Table 6). The
cost increase for each 1 km increase of hauling distance on the
main gravel roads was $2.30/tonne while it was $3.11/tonne for
the secondary roads. Thus, it is important to understand the
impact of hauling distance on the total slash removal cost.

Financial analysis and business requirements
for a roll-off trucking system
The ChargeOut! [2] spreadsheet program was used to determine
hourly break-even rates for each piece of equipment that would
provide a required rate of return on invested capital (ROIC).
ChargeOut! was also used to calculate internal rates of return
(IRR). For our calculations we assumed a nominal (i.e., including
inﬂation) deposit interest rate (4%) was added to an expected
before tax risk premium (21%) to arrive at an expected nominal
before tax required rate of return of 25%. Forest operations
typically involve substantial business risk, requiring a relatively
high risk premium, sometimes up to 25%. After adjusting for
inﬂation (3%) and an income tax rate (33%), a real (i.e. inﬂation-
adjusted) after tax return on invested capital (ROIC) of 13.4%
was calculated. Depreciation was incorporated using the modi-
ﬁedacceleratedcostrecovery method(MACRS) after allowing for
a Section 179 deduction (Internal Revenue Service Publication
946, 2006). The Section 179 deduction allows an additional ﬁrst-
year write-off against taxable income in the ﬁrst-year after the
purchase of certain capital assets. The maximum Section 179
deduction was $108,000 in 2006. However, the ﬁrm must have
sufﬁcient income before depreciation that is at least equal to the
total taxable write-off in order to take full beneﬁt of the Section
179 deduction.
Based on our assumptions, the break-even charge-out rates
for the truck and loader were $57.56/SMH and $69.54/SMH,
respectively. At these rates, the contractors receive a 13.4%
return on their invested capital after accounting for inﬂation
and income taxes. The contractors would earn additional
amounts beyond 13.4% return if they could negotiate charge
rates higher than those break-even rates. These additional
amounts may be used to cover cost items that are not included
in the analysis such as overhead and other indirect cost items.
Positive cash ﬂows over the life of the machine were shown
after initial investments (Table 9), indicating that this busi-
ness may be proﬁtable as long as the input values correctly
reﬂect the business conditions. Year 1 had the highest earning
due to the assumption that the Section 179 deduction was

used against other taxable income. It was further noted that
the last two years (3rd and 4th years for the loader; 6th and 7th
years for the truck) also had high positive cash ﬂows because
they did not include any loan payments. It was assumed that
loan payments were completed by the end of 3rd (loader) and
5th (truck) year.
One may wonder if there is enough work opportunity for the
machinestogeneraterevenue,whichdirectlyimpactstheoverall
businessproﬁtability.Asensitivityanalysisindicatedthattoearn
at the speciﬁed ROIC, the break-even charge-out rates need to be
higher with a decrease in operating hours per year (Fig. 5). For,
example, the break-even rate should be increased to $79.03/hour
for the loader and $70.02/hour for the truck if those machines
were used only 1000 h per year. These represent 13.6% and 21.6%
increases of the break-even rates, respectively, compared to the
equivalent rates that were based on 1600 h per year.
The relationship is not perfectly linear because it is assumed
thatif the number ofoperating hours changes, the maintenance
and repair costs will also change. In the ChargeOut! model,
maintenance and repair costs do not have to be ﬁxed. Rather,
theymay be allowed to change along with the number of annual
productive hours or may be entered individually for each year.

Conclusion
A roll-off trucking system was effectively used to remove
slash resulting from shaded fuelbreak treatments which was
not accessible with a typical highway chip van. This system
provides an option to access areas where current biomass
harvesting systems, including highway chip vans, cannot be
used because of poor access roads. This approach also allows
for removal of hand-piled slash from inaccessible areas
without pile burning, and helps create an opportunity for
utilizing slash to generate energy or produce bio-based forest
products. The overall cost to collect and haul hand-piled slash
was $26.81/green ton with 22% average moisture content or
$34.37/bone dry metric ton. The loader efﬁciently loaded slash
into the containers at low cost ($10.10/tonne) while a roll-off
truck hauled slash at $16.71/tonne for 4.5 km of forest road
hauling distances. Mechanical removal of hand-piled slash
would be an economically viable alternative to pile burning
options under certain situations (e.g. short hauling distance
and high slash volume per ha). Furthermore, slash burning
options raise concerns related to air quality, risk of escaped
ﬁres, and limited burn opportunities.
It should be noted, however, that the costs of roll-off
trucking operations could be signiﬁcantly increased with
increased hauling distance on gravel roads due to slow trav-
eling speeds (less than 18 kph on gravel roads) and low slash
weight being hauled (3.3 tons/trip on average). For example,
the overall cost of slash removal using the roll-off trucking
system increased by $3.11/tonne with each one-km increase
in hauling distance over secondary gravel roads. This suggests
that roll-off trucking systems should be used primarily for
short hauling to a central processing area where sufﬁcient
access for highway chip vans is available.
The break-even charge-out rates for the truck and loader
were $57.56/SMH and $69.54/SMH, respectively. At these rates,
the contractors receive a 13.4% real rate of return on their
invested capital after accounting for inﬂation and income
taxes. These rates did not include overhead and other indirect
cost
items.
Break-even
charge
rates
could
signiﬁcantly
increase with decreases in work days per year, but business
investors should diversify work opportunities (e.g., waste
management and construction sites) that could utilize a roll-
off trucking system to keep their business proﬁtable.
