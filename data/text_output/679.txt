Abstract 
Smoke, Risk, and Intergenerational Equity in Flagstaff, Arizona’s Wildland-Urban 
Interface 
Ethan Barnes 
 
This study addresses two questions with a long-term outlook.  Both questions address the 
combined issues of fire hazard and risk reduction and forest health restoration by 
focusing on smoke production within an intergenerational equity context.  First, what are 
the characteristics of smoke and fuel hazard that might be produced from alternative 
prescribed fire treatments under several management options available for the wildland-
urban interface of Flagstaff, Arizona.  The second question addressed is, what general 
costs and benefits will be passed on to future residents under each management option?  
Different forest management options will result in different patterns of intergenerational 
transfers.  We discuss the intergenerational concepts of justice and equity in the context 
of ecological restoration, focusing on the interplay of fire risk, ecological health, and 
smoke impacts on human health.   
 
A computer simulation approach was used to model potential smoke emissions and 
concentrations along with changes in fuel hazards.  Prescribed fire reduces forest floor 
fuels, but will result in smoke and its associated health effects.  Emissions of particulate 
matter were highest during initial burns but decreased with repeated prescribed fire.  
Future smoke emissions can be reduced by burning on a more frequent interval, which 
keeps fuels from accumulating, and by thinning, which reduces future fuel input to the 

 
3
forest floor.  Thinning also reduces the risk of active crown fire.  However, cumulative 
emissions are higher with more frequent burning.  Although areas restored with heavy 
thinning and frequent burning emitted lower quantities of particulates, results indicated 
that burning these areas could result in more frequently exceeding air quality standards 
than either the initial burns.  We argue that the no treatment option would transfer the 
fewest options to the future and therefore is both unjust and unethical to the future as well 
as the present.  Restoration utilizing thinning and burning would benefit both the current 
and future generations, and transfer the highest amount of natural capital options, but 
must be balanced against the negative health effects of increased smoke.  We suggest that 
smoke effects may be mitigated by increasing the fire return interval closer to 20 years in 
heavily thinned stands.

Preface 
This thesis contains manuscript format chapters.  Because each manuscript chapter was 
written as a separate publishable work, this thesis contains some redundancy.  The two 
manuscripts are collaborative works where the plural pronoun “we” is used.  Elsewhere, 
“I” is used.  There are two manuscripts (chapters 2 and 3), a general introduction, 
literature review and methods (chapter 1), and general conclusions (chapter 4).  Each 
manuscript has its own abstract, introduction and conclusion section, and review of the 
literature.  Given this, the remaining sections in the thesis focus on bringing together the 
concepts discussed in each manuscript so that as a whole the thesis tells a coherent story.

Chapter 1 
Introduction and Literature Review 
 
Introduction 
Fire has been officially recognized as a critical natural process, but for over 100 years has 
often been suppressed. Fire suppression has resulted in severe management problems 
including hazardous fuel accumulation, uncontrollable wildland fire, increased risk to 
human life and property, and ecological deterioration of fire dependent ecosystems. 
Although managers often seek to reduce fuels and risks while attempting to reintroduce 
fire into the ecosystem, social values often override the importance of restoring fire to the 
system. We are caught in a reinforcing feedback cycle, where perceived risk of fire leads 
to suppression, which leads to further increasing risks and hazard, and further suppression 
(Miller et al. 1996).  
 
The purpose of this thesis is to address the impacts of smoke produced by fuel reduction 
and restoration projects in the Flagstaff wildland-urban interface. The use of prescribed 
fire in ecological restoration and fuel reduction treatments will produce smoke. Smoke in 
the air will directly affect local residents, and depending on the weather patterns at the 
time of burning may even affect regional residents. The first point of this research study 
focuses on describing the characteristics of smoke that might be produced from 
prescribed fire treatments under various management options. The second focus is on the 
general costs and benefits passed on to future residents under these management options.

This study considers several management options for the interface area, where reduction 
of the risk of crown fire is a major objective. The study focuses on the amount of smoke 
expected to be produced when prescribed fire is used in combination with various fuel 
reduction options, and considers the impacts in the context of intergenerational equity. 
While the results of this study are specific to management options in the Flagstaff area, 
the methodology and implication of the results will have general applicability to fuel 
reduction and restoration projects in the Southwest.  
 
The first manuscript addresses changing smoke emissions and fuel hazards resulting from 
various management options. We explored the general tradeoffs and interactions between 
various thinning intensities and frequencies of prescribed burning. We utilized the Forest 
Vegetation Simulator Fire and Fuels Extension, a growth and yield model with a fire and 
fuels extension (FVS-FFE) to track changes over a long time period (80 years). The 
second manuscript addresses the intergenerational equity aspects of the various 
management options utilizing the information generated in the first manuscript and with 
the smoke dispersion model SASEM. We redefined the management options as 
intergenerational transfers of natural capital, and discussed them with a focus on 
ecosystem health, fire risk, and smoke impacts on current and future generations.  We 
utilized Flagstaff, Arizona’s wildland-urban interface as a case demonstration for 
applying these various management options to a ponderosa pine forest with many of the 
characteristics of Western forests after years of fire suppression and other land-use 
changes. While both manuscripts taken together explore the issues involved, the literature 

 
13
review in the second part of this chapter provides additional background information 
useful in fully appreciating the linkages between the two manuscripts.  
 
Literature Review 
Chapter 2 reviews changes in fuel hazard and smoke emissions resulting from various 
thinning and prescribed burning treatments. Chapter 3 reviews intergenerational transfers 
of risk and pollution within the conceptual realm of intergenerational equity and justice. 
This literature review focuses on the connections and overlaps between these concepts. 
Although focused specifically on Flagstaff, Arizona’s wildland-urban interface, the 
concepts concern fire adapted ecosystems and what the current generation can do to 
affect future generations.  
 
Southwestern Forests 
Forests in many parts of the Southwest have undergone significant structural and 
functional changes since European settlement (1870-1890). The pre-European landscape 
was predominantly characterized by uneven-aged clumps of trees surrounded by 
herbaceous and woody understory plants (Cooper 1960, Cooper 1961, Covington and 
Moore 1994, Fulé et al. 1997, Moore et al. 1999). High-frequency, low-intensity surface 
fires characterized the fire regime and perpetuated the landscape. Fulé et al. (1997) 
determined reference conditions for Camp Navajo, about 16 km west of Flagstaff; the 
mean fire regime between 1637-1883 was 3.7 years for all fires and 6.5 years for 
widespread fires. The range of variability for all Southwest forests is 2-20 year fire return 
intervals (Swetnam and Baisan 1996, Moore et al. 1999). Euro-Americans introduced 

 
14
industrial logging and grazing to the region, followed by fire suppression starting in the 
1880’s. The resulting landscape now consists predominantly of dense, closed canopy 
forest with few old trees, many small trees, high fuel loads on the forest floor, and low 
understory production and biodiversity. Many individuals among academia, resource 
professionals, and the general public agree that active intervention is required to conserve 
and restore natural (historic) forest structures (native plants, animals, old growth trees) 
and ecosystem processes (frequent fire regime, nutrient cycling) (Covington et al. 1997a). 
One area where these issues are being actively addressed is the wildland-urban interface. 
 
The Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) exists as a continuum where urban areas mix with 
the forest (Feary and Neuenschwander 1998). Flagstaff, AZ, is located in the largest 
contiguous ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest in the world. The city was founded 
in 1881, and has experienced rapid growth in recent years; the population was estimated 
to have reached 55,173 by 2002 (www.epodunk.com). Most of the growth involves 
expansion of suburban developments into previous forested areas and meadows. The 
majority of Flagstaff’s “urban” area lies in the WUI, and is at risk of destruction due to 
wildfire. The Grand Canyon Forest Partnership, a group of individuals and organizations 
concerned with the long-term viability and health of the southern Colorado Plateau, 
developed a boundary that included the area generally within ½ to 1 mile of major 
developments or city lands (Grand Canyon Forest Partnership 2000a). This zone 
generally contains the area where most human caused fires begin, gives fire fighters a 
good area to hold approaching fires, and the distance fire brands can be carried. About 
600 wildfires per year occur in the Flagstaff area, and about half of the approximately 

 
15
76,000 acres in the WUI are classified at high or moderate risk for catastrophic wildfire 
(Grand Canyon Forest Partnership 2000a).  
 
Several techniques are under study to determine methods of addressing the concerns of 
fire risk and reference conditions, primarily focused around the ecological restoration 
concept. The ecological restoration approach emulates reference conditions based on the 
historic, indigenous ecosystem (Society for Ecological Restoration 1993). The ecological 
restoration goals in ponderosa pine forests are to recreate forest structure that 
characterized reference conditions so that ecosystem processes, especially frequent, low-
intensity fires, can resume (Covington and Moore 1994, Covington et al. 1997a, Fulé et 
al. 1997, Mast et al. 1999, Moore et al. 1999). Burn-only experiments began in Fort 
Valley and Long Valley Experimental Forests in 1975 and focused on reintroducing low 
intensity surface fire at 1-10 year intervals (Sackett and Haase 1998). Burn-only methods 
can temporarily reduce fuel loads and release nutrients, but do not effectively thin small 
trees, and can result in significant old growth tree mortality when the heavy duff loads 
accumulated around the base burn. Fine fuels reaccumulate rapidly in dense stands. Thus 
pre-settlement ecological structure (size, number, distribution of trees) is not restored 
(Harringon and Sackett 1990, Sackett 1980, Sackett and Haase 1998). Thin-only 
treatments in Taylor Woods have illustrated that positive responses occur with increased 
thinning intensity, such as increased photosynthesis rates and reduced tree moisture stress 
(Feeney et al. 1998). However, this approach is limited because high levels of hazardous 
fuels remain if slash and other forest floor fuels are not removed. Without fire, nutrient 

 
16
recycling is slow in the arid Southwest and the mechanism to prevent future dense 
overstory conditions is absent.  
 
A combination of thinning and prescribed fire can be used to both alter the forest 
structure and mimic historic fire regimes. Thin and burn methods have been tested using 
various spatial patterns in the Grand Canyon National Park (Covington et al. 1997b) and 
Fort Valley (Covington et al. 1997a, Fulé et al. 1997, Fulé et al. 2000, Harrington and 
Sackett 1990). The patterns differ in the number of leave trees retained in excess of 
reference (presettlement) conditions. Research has shown that combining structural 
restoration and fire alters fire behavior from common crown fires to behavior where 
surface fires occur but crown fires are uncommon. This treatment produces an increase in 
herbaceous productivity, and improves multiple resource values (Covington and Moore 
1994, Covington et al. 1997a, Covington et al. 1997b, Fulé et al. 1997, Fulé et al. 2000, 
Moore et al. 1999).  
 
Smoke 
The use of prescribed fire is one way to meet management objectives, such as reducing 
fuel hazards and catastrophic wildfire risk. Fire produces smoke, which restricts its use as 
a management tool. However, mechanical or chemical treatments cannot fully imitate the 
effects of fire on fire-adapted ecosystems (USDA 1993). When prescribed fire is 
considered for fuel management, it is necessary to consider the production and effects of 
smoke. Smoke from fires (wild or prescribed) can degrade ambient air quality, affect 
respiratory health, impair visibility, and worsen regional haze (Pyne et al. 1996). Water 

 
17
vapor and CO2 comprise over 90% of the combustion products from forest fires; 
however smoke also contains carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM), and 
hydrocarbons such as aldehydes and benzene (USDA 1978, Reinhardt and Ottmar 1997). 
Carbon monoxide, the most abundantly produced pollutant, rapidly disperses with 
distance (USDA 1978). Particulate matter is a major human health concern. Particulates 
from wildland fires are a mix of soot, tars, and volatile organic substances; they serve as 
sorbtion surfaces for harmful gasses. Generally, 70% of wood smoke particulates are 
<2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5), 20% between 2.5 and 10 microns (PM10), and 10% 
are greater than 10 microns (Morgan 1989). Visibility can be impaired by PM10 (less 
than 10 microns in diameter), and PM2.5 (less than 2.5 microns) can be inhaled deep into 
human lungs (Pyne et al. 1996). In recognition of the negative effects of particulates, the 
US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enacted new 24 hour and annual standards 
for both PM10 and PM2.5 in 1997. The PM2.5 standards are 65 ug/m3 and 15.0 ug/m3 
for a 24-hour average and annual arithmetic mean, and the PM10 are 150 ug/m3 and 50 
ug/m3 (24-hour and annual) (US EPA 1997). 
 
The emission rate of smoke production for an area can be estimated from fuel load, fuel 
consumption, fuel moisture, and an emission factor, the mass of pollutant emitted per 
mass of fuel consumed (CH2MHILL 1999). The ratio of carbon released as CO2 to total 
carbon combusted (combustion efficiency) is never 100%. The remainder is released as 
other various chemicals. According to Pyne et al. (1996), PM emissions can range over a 
factor of 10, depending on fire and fuel conditions that affect combustion efficiency. 
Smoldering combustion is the least efficient, releasing the highest amounts of PM and 

 
18
CO. Higher intensity fires with longer flame lengths produce larger particles than low 
intensity and smoldering combustion fires. Emission rates for particulates depend on fire 
type, intensity, and phase (USDA 1978). Heading fires tend to produce about 3 times 
more PM than backing fires. Emission factors for particles vary inversely with 
combustion efficiency (Pyne 1996, USDA 1978).  
 
Fuel loading and weather directly affect fire behavior and smoke emissions. Fuel loads 
vary with ecosystem type and previous management activity (Reinhardt and Ottmar 
1997). Prescribed fire in natural fuels, prescribed fire in activity fuels (fuels resulting 
from silvicultural practices), and wildfire show different smoke characteristics. 
Smoldering burns from duff and large woody fuels often contribute the most smoke to a 
fire (NWCG 1985). Much of the Flagstaff WUI currently possesses ample fuel to support 
high intensity fire behavior in hot, dry weather, including torching through live fuel 
ladders and crown fire (Grand Canyon Forest Partnership 2000a). Wildfires tend to burn 
when fuels are very dry, while burning conditions can be chosen for prescribed fires to 
lower their intensity.  
 
Intergenerational Justice and Equity 
Issues of ecosystem management and sustainability bring up questions about the current 
generation’s obligations to the future. Our ability to affect the way future generations will 
live imposes a responsibility that involves issues of justice and equity, not just questions 
of economic efficiency (Norton and Toman 1997). Intergenerational ethics is concerned 
with how present actions affect future persons and what the present generation owes to 

 
19
the future. Within intergenerational ethics, the concepts of justice and equity are 
important and can sometimes overlap. Within the concept of intergenerational justice, we 
are primarily concerned with distributive justice. Distributive justice is concerned with 
the proper distribution of resources in society over time, while the field of equity focuses 
on decision-making and the fairness of a given distribution (Church 1999, Young 1992).  
 
Justice is a culturally defined concept which places boundaries on interpersonal actions. 
The concepts of justice imply standards of judgment defined by culture and society. By 
labeling something as unjust, a claim is made that is expected to bind the judgments and 
actions of others. It indicates that others of good conscience ought to condemn the action. 
A central concern of justice is how our actions affect others and what obligations we have 
to them (Auerbach 1995). Matters of justice are usually discussed with regards to the 
current generation (Church 1999). That we have an obligation to act justly towards those 
unable to defend themselves, such as the mentally handicapped, is not often disputed. 
Because future generations depend on us and can do us no harm, they also fall under this 
obligation. Intergenerational justice may be defined as “what we owe to remote (not alive 
at the same time) … generations as a matter of justice” (Auerbach 1995). Two core issues 
of intergenerational justice are how our actions affect remote generations and what we 
owe remote generations. The principles stated in the Rio Declaration on Environment and 
Development, ratified at the United Nations Conference on Environment and 
Development, June 1992, acknowledge that future generations have rights (Folke et al. 
1994). One argument, that future people exist only as potential persons, and future 
generations cannot possess rights because only identifiable individuals can possess them, 

 
20
is addressed by Brown Weiss (1994). These rights are redefined as being held by each 
generation as a class. Therefore, even if we chose to define future generations as 
strangers (whose welfare we have no obligation to promote), we still have an obligation 
not to cause harm (Aerback 1995).  
 
Gower (1995) pointed out that when addressing distribution two questions that must be 
addressed are (1) how the benefits of programs intended to prevent or repair damage to 
the environment will be distributed among those affected and (2) how the costs of 
introducing and delivering these programs will be distributed among those who pay. The 
way these are answered illustrates how justice is defined in that society.  
 
Justice may be approached as mutual advantage or as impartiality (Barry 1989). Justice as 
a mutual advantage is a hypothetical contract between two parties, an agreement to move 
from some status quo to a new agreement prospectively beneficial to both. For justice to 
count as a good reason to do something, it must be in the interest of the agent, so it is 
based on self-interest. This position requires voluntary cooperation, and results in a more 
even distribution of benefits than if parties do not cooperate. Justice as impartiality is not 
based on self-interest, but rather on the idea of an impartial observer. One way to gain an 
impartial perspective is to determine which outcome would be favored if the position 
occupied is not known. The motive can be either a direct moral concern for others, or a 
concern for the opinion of others. Because mutual cooperation between past and future 
generations is not possible, mutual advantage is ruled out as a possibility, and 
intergenerational justice must be based on impartiality (Church 1999). There is a 

 
21
problem, however, with the accurate prediction of future needs (Gower 1995). Because 
future generations are unlikely to conceptualize or value justice as we do, we can only 
attempt to act justly towards toward them.  Thus decisions made with a moral concern for 
future generations will be made with respect to the standards of the current generations 
(Auerbach 1995, Church 1999). We know that our policies will affect future generations, 
and they will have similarities and needs even if they do not have a similar concept of 
justice. If we have a shared concept of harm (likely on a base level of physical well-
being), and we can make certain predictions about future circumstances, we ought to 
consider the justice implications of our policies on future generations (Gower 1995). 
Therefore, it is important to find standards to gauge the quality of the world we both 
inherited and the one we will pass on, because we do not know how future generations 
will value our contributions.  
 
Auerbach (1995) argued that “we ought to act toward future generations in such a way 
that future generations are most likely to honor the commitments and build upon the 
moral traditions of their ancestors.” This recognizes the intergenerational nature of 
civilization and is especially meaningful for those concerned with the judgment of 
history. If we establish a tradition of acting justly towards future generations, it is likely 
that the next generation will continue these socially condoned traditions and also act 
justly towards the future. A moral obligation to act justly will not be created unless 
concern for the future is transformed into action.  
 

 
22
Equity refers to the consequences of alternative policies and how they affect the fair or 
just distribution of resources, rights and wealth between people and over time (Young 
1992). Relative rather than minimum standards are the focus of equity. On a societal 
level, because rules have consequences for welfare, they must be justifiable in terms of 
ethical procedure. There is no general agreement as to how one can determine whether or 
not a proposal is equitable. Of the various approaches to address intergenerational equity 
questions, I will briefly discuss the three most well developed and frequently utilized 
approaches of neo-classical economics, Rawls, and Brown Weiss.  
 
Economics is the science of scarcity, and the neo-classical economics approach to future 
generations is to discount future values to the present. The discount rate is the rate used to 
convert a stream of benefits or costs into its present value; how we value future benefits 
today. It is comparable to the interest rate; how much present investments will produce 
over time. The two may be the same, but the discount rate can be manipulated to produce 
a desired outcome (Norgaard and Howarth 1991). Critics of this approach stress the need 
for reflecting social, rather than individual values and for including intrinsic values on 
long-term sustainability (Cairns 1995). Young (1992) pointed out that valuing ecological 
services is difficult for several reasons: consumers are not always the best judges of 
ecological service values, they often do not understand their value, and most economic 
studies assume values should be constrained by wealth, not moral or equity concerns.  
 
Is discounting an appropriate approach for intergenerational equity? Brennan (1999) 
suggested that the question is both a question of obligation and of description. The 

 
23
question of obligation is an ethical question and refers to whether we have a duty to 
sacrifice for future generations, and if so, how much. The question of description refers to 
what would be best to do, if we do sacrifice. Brennan (1999) argued that we should 
sacrifice for future generations only if the average well being increases by more than we 
lose on average today, ensuring future gains exceed our losses. People have a pure-time 
preference, so more than a dollar’s worth of future benefits are required to give up that 
amount today. As long as resource scarcity makes tradeoffs inevitable, consideration of 
policies to benefit future generations should not ignore economic opportunity cost. 
However, ultimately policy decisions will come from the political field, which involves 
ethical reflection and judgment (Brennan 1999).  
 
Norgaard and Howarth (1991) demonstrated that indiscriminate use of discounting does 
not reflect a moral concern for future generations because how a society cares about the 
future (in terms of asset transfer) and the valuation of environmental services are 
interdependent. How rights and assets are distributed across generations determines 
whether an efficient resource allocation will sustain human welfare across generations. 
Environmental valuation with sufficient (not easily defined) caring about the future 
results in sustainability, while valuation with too little asset transfer will not lead to 
sustainability.  
 
To decide equity questions, Rawls (1971) proposed using the original position under a 
veil of ignorance where people collectively decide on societal rules without knowing 
what position they will occupy in society, or what generation they will be part of (Young 

 
24
1992). From this exercise, the principle of maxi-min was developed, where the emphasis 
is on raising the welfare of the worst off person, or, in this case, the worst off generation 
(Church 1999, Schrader-Frechette 1996). Maxi-min tends to favor a conservative position 
regarding environmental damage and acceptability of technological risk because it 
focuses on potentially catastrophic consequences and probabilistic uncertainty (Schrader-
Frechette 1996). With maxi-min, it is rational to choose the action that avoids the worst 
possible consequence of all options. Maxi-min tries to maximize the minimum outcome 
by avoiding policy with the worst possible consequences or that harms the worst-off 
persons. Maxi-min would lead to giving the interests of the least advantaged the highest 
priority and avoids using a utility function, designed for risk taking, in the area of morals, 
where it does not belong. However, this approach is biased toward the values of the 
present generation because it involves estimating the welfare, values, and preferences of 
future generations. It may also entail the current generation making a large sacrifice to 
increase the welfare of future generations. This is very unlikely to occur in reality (Young 
1992, Church 1999). 
 
Brown Weiss (1990, 1994) argued that future preference and value assumptions should 
not be made. Each generation is part of a natural system with special responsibilities as 
well as rights. Each generation receives from its ancestors a natural and cultural legacy in 
trust, which it has a right to benefit from as well as an obligation to conserve for future 
generations. Many of our actions place burdens on future generations by depleting 
resources and degrading environmental quality. Brown Weiss developed three principles 
to guide intergenerational equity decisions: conservation of options, conservation of 

 
25
equality, and conservation of access. Conservation of options is based on the idea that 
each generation ought to conserve the diversity of the natural and cultural resource base 
so it does not overly restrict future options for solving problems and satisfying values, 
and each generation is entitled to diversity comparable to that of previous generations. To 
conserve equality, each generation should pass on the planet in no worse condition than it 
was received. To conserve access, each generation should provide its members with 
equitable access rights to the resource base and conserve this access for future 
generations. 
 
Pearce et al. (1989) argued that achieving intergenerational equity requires earlier 
generations to leave succeeding generations all forms of wealth, including "a stock of 
knowledge and understanding, a stock of technology, a stock of man-made capital and a 
stock of environmental assets no less than that inherited by the current generation.”  A 
stock of knowledge and understanding is highly resistant to entropy, and can even result 
in negative entropy. This can be used to generate corrective behavior to offset 
environmental and ecological damage, but humans are not always capable of applying 
knowledge rationally to improve their well being. Stocks of man-made capital and 
improved technology are not all environmentally benevolent or consistent with 
sustainability. Cumberland (1991) argued that effective transfer mechanisms must be 
centered not only upon monetary and fiscal measures, but upon real resources relevant to 
ecological sustainability. Environmental capital in the form of intact and fully functioning 
natural resource systems and large-scale ecologies may be the scarcest resources of the 
next century. Young (1992) argued that each generation should maintain its inherited 

 
26
resource base and leave the next generation with a per capita stock no less than it 
inherited. If a generation acts to increase future population, it must also increase the 
resource stock so the expected per capita stock of conditionally renewable resources, 
resource diversity, and assimilative capacity stays the same. Church (1999) argued that a 
conservation of options approach is appropriate to address forest management; the most 
equitable forest condition to pass on to the future is one that is the most balanced among 
different structural classes. The least equitable condition to pass on would consist of 
mostly one class. These condition classes can be thought of in terms of an ecosystems’ 
evolutionary environment and can be defined with the help of the historic range of 
variability for the ecosystem in question (Moore et al. 1999). Restoration can be used to 
restore a balanced condition. 
 
Sustainability and Natural Capital 
Sustainability is an ambiguous concept with many published definitions. The Brundtland 
Commission described sustainable development as “development that meets the needs of 
the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own 
needs” (World Commission on Environment and Development 1987). This definition is 
vague enough to be accepted by economists and ecologists alike, but offers little in the 
way of guidance for achieving sustainability. Viederman (1992) defined a sustainable 
society as one that “ensures the health and vitality of human life and culture and of 
nature’s capital, for present and future generations. Such a society acts to stop the 
activities that serve to destroy human life and nature’s capital, and to encourage those 
activities that serve to conserve what exists, restore what has been damaged, and prevent 

 
27
future harm.” This definition alludes to intergenerational equity and specifies 
maintenance of natural capital as prerequisites for sustainability. 
 
Ecosystem services, the activities of the ecosystem that benefit humans, are conditionally 
renewable resources and their management involves sustaining them over time (Costanza 
et al. 1997). There is a large segment of society that believes technology can repair or 
compensate for any problems that may arise from our mismanagement of nature. 
However, the ecological resources that may become scarce are not those we have a long 
experience successfully managing, let alone technical innovation to mitigate constraints 
(Norton and Toman 1997). Moreover, most resource managers believe that ecosystems 
can provide services at less cost and with more reliability than technology.  
 
Because the natural “capital” of many ecosystems has been depleted by past 
management, such as fire exclusion, the ecological surplus (interest) has suffered to the 
point that we are living off the principle. Once damaged, ecological restoration is an 
option for returning some of their services. Cairns (1995) defines restoration as “the 
return of an ecosystem to a close approximation of its condition prior to disturbance”. 
The central idea of restoration is that ecosystems function best under the conditions in 
which they adapted over evolutionary time, and if these conditions are returned at 
satisfactory spatial and temporal scales this will result in the preservation and continued 
evolution of the system’s biodiversity (Swanson et al. 1994). For Southwest ponderosa 
pine forests, these evolutionary conditions included open, park-like forests, productive 
herbaceous understory, and frequent low-intensity fires (Fulé et al. 1997, Moore et al. 

 
28
1999). Current conditions represent a large departure from the historic range of 
variability for these factors. The introduction of widespread livestock grazing, selective 
logging, and active fire suppression, while appearing at the time to be wise uses of the 
ponderosa pine-bunchgrass community surrounding Flagstaff, were in hindsight 
disinvestments that served to depreciate natural capital. We need to rebuild the ecological 
capital by reinvesting in the system so it will once more be able to provide long-term 
goods and service by-products.

Projected Smoke Emissions and Fuel Changes Associated with Restoration in 
Flagstaff, Arizona’s Wildland-Urban Interface 
 
Abstract 
A variety of management options, many involving prescribed fire, have been proposed as 
methods for restoring ecosystem health and lowering the risk of catastrophic wildfire in 
the Wildland-Urban Interface areas in the Southwestern US. However, smoke from fires 
can degrade air quality, affect respiratory health, and decrease visibility. This study 
models expected smoke production by varying the return interval of prescribed fire on 
four different thinning intensities. Much higher emissions were produced during 
preliminary burns, but decreased rapidly with repeated burning. Stand history prior to 
thinning had little effect on emissions. Smoke emissions decrease in quantity over time in 
response to repeated burning. Increased thinning results in lower future emissions. Total 
emissions produced over time were highest with more frequent burning, but less during 
any one burn. Potential smoke emissions from crown fire followed the same pattern. 
Although the 20-year burning intervals result in approximately twice the smoke emitted 
per acre compared with a 5-year interval, the 5-year interval results in burning each acre 
4 times as often. 
 
Introduction 
Forests in many parts of the Southwest have undergone significant structural and 
functional changes since European settlement (1870-1890). The introduction of grazing, 

 
36
logging, and fire suppression resulted in a landscape with a high catastrophic wildfire risk 
(Cooper 1960, Cooper 1961, Covington and Moore 1994, Covington et al. 1994, Fulé et 
al. 1997, Moore et al. 1999). The Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) exists as a continuum 
where urban areas mix with the forest (Feary and Neuenschwander 1998). Flagstaff, AZ 
is located in the largest contiguous ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest in the world. 
Flagstaff, founded in 1881, has experienced rapid growth in recent years. The population 
in was 52,894 in 2000, and was estimated to have reached 55,173 by 2002 
(www.epodunk.com). Most of the growth involves expansion of suburban developments 
into previous forested areas and meadows. The majority of Flagstaff’s “urban” area lies 
in the WUI, and is at risk of destruction due to wildfire. About 600 wildfires per year 
occur in the Flagstaff area, and about half of the 180,000 acres in the WUI are classified 
at high or moderate risk for catastrophic wildfire (Grand Canyon Forest Partnership 
2000).  
 
Techniques are under study to determine methods for addressing these concerns, 
primarily focused around the ecological restoration concept. The ecological restoration 
goals in ponderosa pine forests are to recreate forest structure that characterized reference 
conditions so that ecosystem processes, especially frequent, low-intensity fires, can 
resume (Moore et al. 1999). Structural restoration combined with prescribed fire 
produces an increase in herbaceous productivity and old growth tree responses 
(Covington et al. 1997, Fulé et al. 2001, Kolb et al. 2001). The use of prescribed fire also 
meets management objectives, such as reducing fuel hazards and decreasing catastrophic 
wildfire risk. Mechanical or chemical treatments probably cannot fully imitate the effects 

 
37
of fire on fire-adapted ecosystems (USDA 1993). However, the use of fire produces 
smoke, which constrains its use as a management tool. When prescribed fire is 
considered for fuel management, it is necessary to consider the production and effects of 
smoke.  
 
Smoke from wildland fires and other sources, such as fuelwood burning, can degrade 
ambient air quality, affect respiratory health, impair visibility, and worsen regional haze 
(Pyne et al. 1996). Exposure to smoke reduces lung function, increases the severity of 
existing lung disease, irritates eyes, and triggers headaches, while long-term exposure 
may lead to emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and various cancers (Washington State 
Department of Ecology 1997). Smoke has a complex chemistry that varies with time and 
space within and between burn episodes. Water vapor and CO2 comprise over 90% of the 
combustion products from forest fires, but smoke contains varying amounts of carbon 
monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM), and hydrocarbons (Pyne et al. 1996, Reinhardt 
and Ottmar 1997, USDA 1978). Carbon monoxide is the most abundantly produced 
pollutant, but it rapidly disperses with distance (USDA 1978). Aldehydes, such as 
formaldehyde and acrolein, are irritants and some are suspected carcinogens (Dost 1991). 
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzo(a)pyrene, are often mutagenic and 
carcinogenic (Koenig et al. 1988, Morgan 1989). 
 
Particulate matter (PM) found in smoke is a major public health concern. It forms 
primarily by agglomeration of condensed hydrocarbons and tar as well as mechanical 
entrapment of vegetation fragments and ash. These particles also serve as sorbtion 

 
38
surfaces for harmful compounds. The size distribution of particles varies with fire type 
and distance from source, but generally, 70% of wood smoke particulates are <2.5 
microns in diameter (PM2.5), 20% between 2.5 and 10 microns (PM10), and 10% are 
greater than 10 microns (Morgan 1989). PM10 is < 10microns and includes PM 2.5. 
PM10 can penetrate the respiratory tract, and PM2.5 is small enough to reach the alveolar 
region of the lungs and also has the maximum effect on visibility. Prescribed fire smoke 
constituents are regulated through the Clean Air Act, as well as other state and local 
regulations, with a focus on particulates. Recently, the US EPA initiated 24-hour PM2.5 
standards of 65 ug/m3 and lowered existing PM10 standards to 150 ug/m3 (US EPA 
1997). 
 
We examined a range of management options designed to reduce fire risk and restore 
ponderosa pine forests in Flagstaff’s WUI. We addressed the following research 
questions: 
• What amounts of smoke (PM10 and PM2.5) would be produced under three 
return intervals for prescribed fire following four different levels of thinning 
intensity?  
• What effect would these management options have on fuel hazards? 
 
Methods 
Study Area 
The Fort Valley Experimental Treatments are located in and adjacent to the Fort Valley 
Experimental Forest, approximately 9.5 miles northwest of Flagstaff, AZ. The elevation 

 
39
is approximately 7200-7400 ft. and the climate cool and subhumid with an early summer 
drought (USDA 1998). About half of the average 22 in. of precipitation occurs as snow, 
and the mean annual temperature is 45.5 F. Soils are weathered from basaltic parent 
material, with bedrock at approximately 10 in. The vegetation consists of scattered 
presettlement ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) characterized by larger size and 
yellowed bark (“yellow pines”), with dense thickets of smaller, dark-barked trees 
(“blackjacks”) (Dieterich 1980). The understory consists of perennial grasses, mainly 
Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica), mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia montana), and 
squirreltail (Sitanion hystrix), and scattered forbs and shrubs. The Fort Valley 
Experimental Forest has not experienced fire for around 120 years.  
 
Experimental Blocks and Treatments 
We utilized stand data from three thinning treatments and unthinned controls being tested 
in Fort Valley study area (Fulé et al. 2001, USDA 1998). The treatments varied in terms 
of residual tree densities, which are based on different numbers of trees selected to 
replace dead presettlement trees. Evidence of presettlement trees included stumps, snags, 
and logs of presettlement age. Where such evidence was found, several of the largest 
trees within 30 ft. were retained. The search radius was expanded to 60 ft. if needed to 
locate appropriate trees. All living presettlement trees were retained. The heavy thin (full 
restoration) treatment retained 1.5-3 postsettlement replacement trees for each evidence 
of a dead presettlement replacement tree. The number of replacement trees was 
determined by size of selected replacements. If available replacement trees were greater 
than 16 in. diameter an average of 1.5 replacements were selected, otherwise three trees 

 
40
were selected. This produced a tree density nearest to presettlement levels (Table 2.1). 
The medium thin and light thin prescriptions represented higher tree densities, with 2-4 
replacements and 3-6 replacements, respectively. The no thin treatment retained dense 
stands of small trees with interspersed yellow pines.  
 
These treatments were tested on three experimental blocks in and adjacent to the Fort 
Valley Experimental Forest. Treatments were randomly assigned. Larson et al. (1999) 
characterized three types of ponderosa pine stands at Fort Valley: yellow pine, blackjack 
pine, and mixed yellow and blackjack. Experimental block 1 corresponded to the yellow 
pine type, containing 30+ yellow pines/acre; trees characterized by yellow bark, large 
size, and an age greater than 150 years. These stands also contained a large number of 
small trees, giving them a bimodal diameter distribution. The blackjack type (block 3), 
contained younger and smaller trees with black bark. Block 3 was located outside the 
Experimental Forest and differed from the others in past management practices. It has 
been more heavily harvested for large trees and thinned from below, removing both large 
and small trees from the site and leaving it dominated by mid-sized trees. Block 2 
typified a mixed yellow and blackjack stand with large numbers of small trees as well as 
a small number (<12 trees/acre) of yellow pines. The yellow pine and mixed units (blocks 
1 and 3) contained more large trees than the blackjack stand, but trees in the smallest size 
class remained numerically dominant.  
 
Blocks were thinned between November 1998 and September 1999. Blocks 1 and 2 were 
thinned with a mechanical feller and limbed at the tree, resulting in broadcast fuels. Block 

 
41
3 was whole tree harvested and the resulting slash piles were burned in February 2000. 
All blocks were broadcast burned in 2000 and 2001.  
 
Sampling Methods 
Twenty 0.1 acre plots were established in each of the 12 units and permanently marked 
with iron stakes (Fulé et al. 2001). Slope and aspect were recorded. Live and dead 
overstory trees over breast height (4.5 ft.) were measured and species, condition class, 
and dbh were recorded. Stumps and downed trees were also recorded. Tree heights and 
average crown base height per plot were measured. Trees below breast height were tallied 
by condition class and by three height classes (0-15.7 in., 15.8-31.5 in., and 31.6-54 in.) 
on a nested 0.025 acre subplot. Forest floor material and dead woody biomass were 
measured on a 50 ft. planar transect in a random direction from each plot center. Woody 
debris biomass was calculated using methods described in Brown (1974) and Sackett 
(1980). Plots were originally measured from August through November 1998, and were 
remeasured in October 1999 to obtain the post thinning, pre-burn fuel loading. Prior to 
thinning, fuel loads ranged from 5.5 to 26.6 tons/acre. Preburn, post thin fuel loads were 
similar in all units before treatment ranging from 21.5 to 27.7 tons/acre. Total surface 
fuels were representative of similar forests in the Southwest (Sackett 1979, Sackett and 
Haase 1998).  
 
Simulations 
We utilized the Central Rockies Variant of the Forest Vegetation Simulator Fire and 
Fuels Extension (FVS-FFE) to compare the effects of 16 combinations of thinning 

 
42
treatments and prescribed burning (Table 2.2) on PM10 and PM2.5 emissions and surface 
fuels. FVS is an individual tree, distance independent growth and yield model that is 
widely accepted for planning purposes and supported by the USDA Forest Service 
(Dixon 2001, Wykoff et al. 1982). The Central Rockies Variant of FVS was originally 
developed in 1990, based on the growth equations of the GENGYM model (Edminster et 
al. 1991, Dixon 2001). Sites near the present study area were measured to develop growth 
and yield equations for the Central Rockies Variant (Edminster et al. 1991).  
 
The Fire and Fuels Extension (FFE) to FVS simulates fire effects, fuel loading, and snag 
dynamics (Beukema et al. 1998). The FFE integrates FVS with elements from existing 
fire behavior and effects models. Snags are tracked from the time they are created to their 
removal through user-specified management or falling. Snags experience gradual crown 
and height loss and decay, which move material into the fuels component. The fuels 
submodel tracks litter, duff, and woody surface fuels as well as live and dead crown fuels. 
Woody surface fuel is tracked in 6 size classes and 4 decay rate classes, based on species 
and diameter of wood when added to the pool. Input comes from snags, live tree crowns, 
and management slash. The model contains default fuel levels based on stand cover and 
age, but we chose to use measured fuel loads for each plot to increase accuracy. Removal 
occurs through decay, management, or fire. With decay, 1/10 of the material moves into 
the duff pool annually, while the remainder is lost to the atmosphere. Movement between 
size classes is not modeled. The submodel also tracks live herbaceous and shrub fuels to a 
limited extent. These fuels are important to smoke calculations, but are not dynamically 
simulated by FFE. Instead, it represents them as habitat-type specific constant values. 

 
43
The fire submodel is only active if the user has specifically requested it and can simulate 
fires only if the user defines the times and parameters. The FFE does not simulate fire 
spread or probability of fire. FVS provides information about the trees in the stand, and 
the fuel submodel provides information about fuel loading. The burn model then 
calculates the predicted or simulated effects of the fire on fuels, live trees, and snags, and 
also fuel consumption and smoke emissions. Fire intensity does not directly affect fuel 
consumption in FFE, although in reality it has a significant effect on the proportion of 
large and small particles. The model calculates smoke production as PM2.5 and PM10 
using a series of emission factors applied to the amount of fuel consumed. Fuel 
consumption is determined by: size, moisture content, and type (natural, piled).  
 
We ran each of the 20 plots per block individually for 80 years, simulating prescribed fire 
beginning at year 0 using three different burn intervals; 5, 10, and 20 years. The shorter 
intervals are within the historic range of variability for many Northern Arizona ponderosa 
pine forests (2-8 years) (Moore et al. 1999). The 20 year interval was included to look at 
a longer interval that may serve the management goal of reducing fire hazard, and is still 
within the 2-20 year range of variability for all Southwestern ponderosa pine forests 
(Swetnam and Baisan 1996). We also simulated the stands with fire exclusion. The FVS 
default simulation cycle is 10 years. To incorporate the 5-year burn cycle, we altered the 
cycle length to 5 years. Altering the time interval between projections introduces bias into 
the predicted stand attributes (Wykoff et al. 1982). For consistency, we used 5-year 
cycles for all FVS-FFE runs. We ran each plot as an individual stand and then 
summarized the output for each management option. Based on a review of several 

 
44
prescribed burn plans for Fort Valley, we used the following parameters: throttle-back 
burn, 3 ft. flame length, and 0 percent crowning. Flamelengths in this range are still 
controllable by direct attack at the head and flanks using hand tools, and throttle-back 
burns further reduce flamelength by 30% by confining the burn to thin strips (Pyne et al. 
1996). 
 
Sensitivity Analysis 
The model parameters for FVS have been the subject of extensive testing (Wykoff et al. 
1982). The FFE, however, is relatively new. We ran a sensitivity analysis on three factors 
that were under direct user control, two affecting the fuels submodel and one affecting 
the fire submodel. We altered (1) the decay rate for all fuel and decay classes, (2) the 
proportion of decayed material that enters the duff pool from each fuel category, and (3) 
the flamelength of the prescribed burn to analyze the effects of slight changes in the burn 
conditions. We chose these factors because they should have a considerable effect on 
smoke emissions through control of fire intensity and fuel loading. Although flamelength 
does not directly affect fuel consumption in the FFE, it does affect mortality and snag 
dynamics, which in turn affect the fuel submodel. Using the default values and stand 
input parameters as the base, we analyzed the sensitivity by separately varying each 
factor by +/- 10%. The sensitivity of FVS-FFE to each factor was measured by 
computing the percent change in PM10 emissions for the thinning treatments with the 
largest difference between PM10 emissions, the no-thin and heavy-thin treatments. These 
treatments were run using 20-year burn intervals, as this would allow the largest 
differences in fuel loads to accumulate.  

 
45
 
Analysis 
Statistical analysis was conducted using SAS-JMP 4.0 (Sall and Lehman 1996). We 
analyzed fuel loading and smoke emissions in terms of PM10 and PM2.5 by comparing 
differences between blocks, treatments, and burning intervals using ANOVA. Alpha level 
was 0.05. Following a statistically significant ANOVA result, treatment means were 
compared with a post-hoc Tukey’s procedure. We compared differences within the same 
treatment/burn interval between the first burn (year 2000), the next subsequent burn (5, 
10 or 20 years later) and at year 2080 using a paired t-test to detect significant differences 
between time periods. Because fuel hazards generally increased between burns, we 
analyzed pre-burn fuel loads to compare fuel hazards. Only significant (p>0.05) changes 
are presented below. 
 
Results 
Fuel Loading 
Since we kept fire characteristics constant, fuel loading was the variable primarily 
responsible for differences in smoke production.  All fuels were reduced with burning, 
followed by a subsequent rise (Figures 2.1a-e). The magnitude of fuel accumulation 
between burns was determined by the intensity of thinning and the amount of time 
between burns. There was a clear difference between unburned and burned simulations, 
and the unthinned and the three thinning treatments, showing that thinning reduced future 
available fuel. Burning on a 5-year interval did not allow much fuel build-up on any unit, 
even the unthinned stands, while a 20-year interval allowed time for a larger fuel buildup.  

 
46
 
Without thinning or burning, total surface fuels experienced an initial decrease, then an 
increase to 57% above the initial fuel load. By year 80, fuels in the 0-3 in. range 
increased steadily to 27% above year 0. Fuels in the 3+ category showed an initial sharp 
decrease (possibly an artifact of the model), then an increase to 51% above year 0. Litter 
and duff increased gradually and continually over time. Thinned, unburned stands 
exhibited reductions in total fuels over the first 20 years, indicating decomposition 
outpaced accumulation, followed by an increase through year 80, indicating the 
reductions were short term in nature. Fuels in the 0-3 in. range also exhibited an initial, 
gradual reduction, followed by an increase proportional to the thinning intensity. Heavier 
thinning resulted in a smaller increase. Fuels in the 3+ category showed the same pattern 
and possible program artifact as the unthinned treatment, but remained below pre-thin 
levels. Litter gradually decreased, but by year 80 began to increase. Duff showed a slight 
increase. 
 
Burning at year 0 resulted in an average of 82% reductions in total surface fuels for all 
thinning treatments. Burning at any of the three burn intervals resulted in a significant 
reduction in total fuel loads compared to preburn loads. Total surface fuels showed 
consistent reductions with burning, with less fuel remaining with increased burning 
frequency and thinning intensity. Fuels in the 0-3 in. range decreased with the first burn 
between 73 and 35%, followed by a gradual increases for both 10 and 20-year burning 
intervals. Subsequent 0-3 in. fuels remained low for 5-year burn intervals. The same 
pattern is seen with 3+ in fuels, with a much greater initial reduction. Significant 

 
47
differences between treatments did not appear for 3+ in. fuels until year 20. Litter loads 
showed reductions of 83-97% with the first burn, and a continuous reduction for 5-year 
burns, a leveling off for 10-year burns, and a gradual increase for 20-year burns. The first 
burn reduced duff by 77% and continued burning at any of the three intervals continued 
to reduce duff loading. 
 
Smoke Emissions 
The initial differences between blocks in terms of stand history and harvesting techniques 
did not produce significant differences (p>0.05) in PM10 or PM2.5 emissions at year 
2000, 2020, or 2080. This lack of significant differences held for all treatments and burn 
intervals. 
 
Patterns of smoke emissions varied by thinning intensity and by burning interval (Figures 
2.2a-b). Emissions from the first burn were high from all four thinning intensities, but 
decreased with repeated burning as fuel loads decreased. The production of PM10 during 
the first burns for the no thin treatments averaged 0.16 tons/acre, light thin averaged 0.17 
tons/acre, and both medium and heavy thin averaged 0.14 tons/acre. The production of 
PM2.5 during the initial burns for the no thin treatments averaged 0.13 tons/acre, light 
thin averaged 0.14 tons/acre, medium and heavy thin averaged 0.12 tons/acre.  
 
Increased thinning resulted in lower future emissions, because less canopy was available 
to drop fuels. By year 80, emissions for the no thin treatments were approximately twice 
as high as the heavy thinning treatments. All three thinning treatments resulted in 

 
48
emissions production closer to each other than the no thin treatments. Different burning 
regimes also led to quantitative differences in emissions. More frequent burning resulted 
in lower emissions per acre when burned than a less frequent interval, a result of less fuel 
accumulating between burns. Emissions were also reduced more rapidly when the stand 
was burned more frequently. 
 
We found no significant difference in emissions from the first burn (year 2000) between 
treatments. Differences between treatments were most noticeable in the future burns, 
after the emissions production leveled off and variability decreased. Significant 
differences (P<.0001) tended to appear at the second burn, 5, 10, or 20 years later, 
between no thin and thinning treatments. By year 2080, significant differences (P<.0001) 
existed between all treatments except for medium and light thin, and medium and heavy 
thin burned at 20-year intervals. Emissions for all management options showed 
significant decreases (P<.0001) over time between 2000 and 2020 and on to 2080. PM2.5 
emissions showed a more rapid decrease with repeated burning than PM10 emissions, 
corresponding with patterns seen only in duff loading. 
 
Increased frequency of burning led to lower PM emissions per burn, but higher 
cumulative emissions over the 80-year period (Figures 2.3a-b). When burned less 
frequently, more biomass is lost to the atmosphere by decomposition than from 
consumption. Increased thinning intensity also effectively reduced cumulative emissions 
of PM by reducing the biomass added to the fuel pool over time. The relative effects of 
each of these treatments are such that the unthinned stands burned on 20-year intervals 

 
49
produce approximately as much cumulative PM as the heavy thin stands burned on 5-
year intervals. Heavy thinning combined with a 20-year burning interval produced the 
lowest cumulative PM overall.  
 
Sensitivity Analysis 
FVS-FFE results were relatively insensitive to varying the factors affecting fuel loading 
and flamelength by +/- 10% (Table 2.3). PM10 emission predictions were least sensitive 
to flamelength, with the heavy thinned stand averaging less than 1% change over the 80-
year period, and the unthinned stand increasing average PM10 emissions by 1.2% with a 
reduction in flamelength and reducing average emissions by 1.4% with an increase in 
flamelength.  
 
PM10 emissions were most sensitive to the two alterations of the fuel submodel. 
Maximum sensitivity was found by reducing the duff production, which reduced PM10 
emissions by an average of 8.8% and 9.6% for the heavy thinned and unthinned stands, 
respectively. Increasing this factor produces a lesser effect, increasing emissions by 1.1% 
and 1.2%. Reducing the fuel decay rates by 10% effectively increased PM10 emissions 
by 1.7% and 2.9% for the thinned and unthinned stands, respectively. Increasing this 
factor results in a reduction of 1.6% and 2.0%. The overall trend of sensitivity with 
thinning intensity was that the unthinned stand was more sensitive to the three parameters 
than the heavy thinned stand.

Discussion 
FVS-FFE provides an estimate of the amount of smoke emitted, but does not model the 
important effects of space and time scales. Burning intervals, thinning intensities, and the 
time span in which we conduct the preliminary burns will determine how rapidly we 
reduce both smoke levels from prescribed fire and the risk of catastrophic fire, as well as 
who will be impacted by smoke and for how long. These modeling results can be 
tentatively extrapolated to Flagstaff’s WUI, assuming that the fuel loads, stand structure, 
and emissions data from Fort Valley are similar to what would be experienced across the 
entire interface. The Flagstaff Area Wildfire Risk Assessment (Grand Canyon Forest 
Partnership, 2000) classified the Flagstaff WUI into 78,100 acres of high, medium, and 
low catastrophic fire potential based on fuel type, fuel loads, forest age and density, 
access, slope, and aspect. Embedded within this area are 16,000 acres of highly urbanized 
residential and business areas.  
 
We assumed that the high risk areas possessed stand profiles similar to the unthinned 
stands, medium risk areas were similar to medium and light thin stands, and low risk 
areas were similar to heavy thin stands. This classification appeared to most accurately 
represent the ponderosa pine forests in the WUI. We recognize, however, that this is a 
simplification in that stand conditions were not the only factor utilized in assessing risk. 
Other factors included slope, aspect, and proximity to structures. In addition, not all of 
the WUI will be treated and some dense canopy will be retained for wildlife habitat, 
screening, and nutrient cycling. In addition, some of the WUI may be thinned, but not 
burned. Areas located adjacent to homes, for example, may not be broadcast burned to 

 
51
avoid the danger of escaped fire. We calculated the number of acres needing thinning and 
burning per year under each burning interval (Table 2.4). For example, to treat both the 
high and medium risk areas and burn at a 5-year burning interval would require the 
yearly burning of approximately 7,820 acres, whereas to treat the same area with a 20-
year burning interval would require burning only 1,955 acres per year. Based on 
conversations with Forest Service personnel, there are an average of 75-80 days per year 
suitable for prescribed burning in the general area of Flagstaff. These days are distributed 
throughout the year, with many falling at times suitable for burning only slash piles 
(winter). Based on an estimate of 75 burning days per year, burning of both high and 
medium risk areas on a 5-year interval would require burning 104 acres per burning day, 
while a 20-year interval would require burning 26 acres per burning day (Table 2.5).  
 
The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality mandates that without special 
clearance, no more than 50 contiguous acres in the WUI can be burned per day. Burning 
50 acres of heavily thinned forest would result in the emission of 7.0 tons of PM10 and 
6.0 tons of PM2.5 into the airshed during the first burn. With the first burn of 50 acres of 
unthinned forest approximately 8.0 tons of PM10 and 6.5 tons of PM2.5 would be 
emitted. By 2080, differences between burning intervals and thinning treatments would 
be more apparent. When burned on a 5-year rotation, the unthinned stand produced 1.5 
and 1.0 tons of PM10 and PM2.5, respectively, at year 2080,while heavily thinned stands 
produced 1.0 and 0.5 tons of PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. Unthinned stands burned on 
a 20 year interval produced 3.5 and 4.5 tons of PM10 and PM2.5, respectively, while 
heavily thinned stands produced 1.5 tons of both PM10 and PM2.5. When fuel hazards 

 
52
are considered, heavy fuel loads are found in the unburned stands through year 2080. 
Fuel hazards are reduced with each burn, and remain low with the 5-year intervals, but 
increase between burns with 20-year intervals. Although the 20-year burning intervals 
result in approximately twice the smoke emissions per acre as the 5-year intervals, with 
5-year intervals each acre is burned 4 times as often.  
 
Smoke emission patterns predicted by our simulation are primarily a result of the amount 
of fuel consumed, how quickly the fuel load is reduced over time, yearly additions 
through needle cast and branch-fall, and how long it is allowed to accumulate between 
burns. Variation in ignition patterns, wind, slope, and fuel moisture would cause shorter 
or longer flame lengths in some areas. We held flame lengths at a constant 3 feet. Fires of 
higher intensity (longer flame lengths) produce lower emissions of particulate matter, but 
with proportionately larger particles than low intensity and smoldering combustion fires 
(Ward and Hardy 1991). PM2.5 emission factors generally decrease with higher fire 
intensities.  
 
As duff, ladder fuels, and large logs are consumed over time, there will be a decrease in 
potential fire intensity, total energy release, and resistance to control (Sackett and Haase 
1998). Prescribed burning reduces large logs differently depending on the state of 
decomposition. Rotten logs are generally almost totally consumed, decreasing firebrand 
potential and receptive ignition sites. Sound logs generally decrease in diameter when 
burned, but persist through several fires, leaving the number of logs essentially the same. 
In ponderosa pine forests, needles are the fuels that cause most of the dynamic fire 

 
53
behavior. Removing them through burning greatly reduces the fire hazard, but needles 
reaccumulate quickly. Litter loads were reduced substantially with prescribed burning, 
reducing ignitability and rate-of-spread potential. Over time, all stands and burning 
intervals experienced an overall reduction in litter load, except the unburned, unthinned 
stands, which showed an overall increase. This result indicates that even without burning, 
thinning can reduce future ignitibility and rate-of-spread potential.  
 
To meet the goal of reducing fire hazard, various surface fuel targets are stated in the 
literature for Fort Valley, ranging from 2 to 8 tons/acre (USDA 1998). In our simulation, 
the initial burns reduced mean total surface fuel loads to within this range, although all 
treatments contained stands that remained far above this goal. By the time the burned 
units reach their next burn (5, 10, or 20 years later), fuel loads increased but remain 
within this limit for the thinned stands. The unthinned stands were slightly above the 
upper limit, and by 2079, mean fuel loads are far above this goal for all unburned 
treatments. All stands burned on 5-year intervals were in the lower end of the range. 
Unthinned treatments burned on 10- and 20-year intervals were above the limit, with the 
20-year intervals higher than the 10-year intervals. Thinning treatments burned on 10 
year intervals were within the fuel target, as were the heavy and medium thin treatments 
burned on 20-year intervals.  
 
PM10 emissions simulated in our study are within the range reported by other 
researchers. Huff et al. (1995) reported current PM10 emissions from prescribed fires in 
several watersheds within the Columbia River Basin ranged from 0.14 to 0.18 tons/acre, 

 
54
which also encompasses the means of our first burns. However, wildfires produced 0.28 
to 0.36 tons/acre of PM10 within the same watersheds, an amount that was actually 
surpassed by several higher-end plots during the first burn in our simulations. Einfeld et 
al. (1991) found that approximately 0.42 tons/acre of PM2.5 were emitted from 
Northwest Montana logging slash. Hardy (1992) estimated that the Silver Fire, a 96,000 
acre wildfire in Southeast Oregon, produced about 0.28 tons/acre of PM2.5. While these 
amounts are high compared to our mean emission levels, the maximum levels of smoke 
come close to these high values. 
 
The trend of high initial emissions followed by a rapid decrease with repeated burning is 
similar to that found by Schaaf (1996), looking at the long-term effects of fuel treatments 
on annual emissions from both wild and prescribed fires in the Grande Ronde River 
Basin in Northeast Oregon. Six levels (0-5%) of prescribed fire treatment were simulated 
over a 100-year period to test if fuel treatments at landscape levels would result in fewer 
impacts from wildfire to life, property, natural resources, and air quality. Results 
suggested that annual wildfire emissions could be reduced with increased fuel treatment. 
Total emissions were found to increase over the first 40 years with increased prescribed 
burning, then to level off and eventually decrease slightly at 80 years. However, the real 
tradeoff came with increased control and better dispersion conditions that prescribed fires 
have over wildfires.  
 
Robinson et al. (2004) collected PM2.5 samples during first entry burns and a 
maintenance burn in primarily grassland fuel near Flagstaff, Arizona. During first entry 

 
55
burns, ambient concentrations of PM2.5 within the burned area ranged from 2541 and 
6459 ug/m3 during the flaming stage, while the concentration during maintenance fires 
(grassland) was 523 ug/m3. Smoldering particle concentrations were lower (155-904 
ug/m3), but began within 4 hours of ignition and continued for several days.  
 
Potter and Fox (1996) describe the two primary components of smoke management as 
managing the atmosphere for dispersion and the fire itself for production. The first 
utilizes the atmosphere to dilute and disperse emissions before they impact people and 
population centers. One aspect of this approach is to generate enough energy in the fire to 
loft smoke in a plume well above the canopy, as well as burning at times and locations 
where the wind will transport the smoke away from population centers.  
 
The second component is the management of the fire process itself to minimize pollution 
generation. Peterson and Leenhouts (1997) discussed various techniques that can be 
employed to reduce prescribed fire emissions, many of which are currently in use in 
Flagstaff’s WUI. The area burned can be reduced by mechanical treatments such as 
chipping and crushing. Fuel loading can be reduced by physically removing fuels prior to 
burning and burning more frequently with low-intensity fires. Thinning treatments fall 
into this category by reducing yearly fuel accumulation through needle and branch fall. 
Fuel consumption can be reduced if some fuels are at or above the moisture of extinction 
where they will not burn; however unless the remaining fuels decompose or are otherwise 
removed prior to future burning this does not result in long-term emissions reduction. 
This option is useful for reducing wildfire hazard by removing fine and intermediate fuel 

 
56
while limiting duff and large fuel consumption, and also retains debris for wildlife and 
nutrient cycling. Protection of large woody fuel from consumption for wildlife and soil 
productivity is called for by the Fort Valley Environmental Assessment (USDA 1998), 
which would result in a reduction of smoke emitted from the burn. The final method for 
reducing emissions is to reduce the emission factor by shifting consumption from 
smoldering into the flaming phase. Changes in combustion efficiency between flaming 
and smoldering combustion have a large effect on the character of the resulting 
emissions. Most pollutant emission factors except for NOx and CO2 are negatively 
correlated with combustion efficiency, so acting to reduce one pollutant effectively 
reduces them all (Peterson and Leenhouts 1997). Einfeld et al. (1991) found that 
smoldering combustion produced about 50% more PM2.5 and CO than flaming 
combustion. Robinson et al. (2004) also found that concentrations of PM2.5 within a 
burned area were much less during smoldering than flaming combustion. 
 
Ward and Hardy (1991) found that PM emission factors for long-needled conifer litter 
burned with backing and heading fires range from 40-100 pounds/ton of fuel consumed, 
while cured grass emission factors are generally 20 pounds/ton of fuel consumed. This 
means that as Flagstaff’s WUI changes from a closed canopy ponderosa pine forest with 
fuels almost entirely composed of conifer litter toward a more open landscape of 
scattered trees and fuels consisting primarily of cured grass, PM emissions would 
decrease, even if total fuel load remained the same.  
 

 
57
Thinning and prescribed burning alone or in combination will not eliminate catastrophic 
fires, but can substantially reduce the risk of both passive and active crown fire. Fulé et 
al. (2001) compared potential fire behavior in the same set of thinning prescriptions and 
concluded that all three thinning treatments resisted crown burning, with the degree of 
resistance increasing with increased thinning intensity. However, slash fuels must be 
removed or crown fires can occur in severe wildfire conditions. Fulé et al. (2002) found 
that a burn only treatment thinned many small trees, reduced fuels, and raised crown base 
height, but had minor effects on crownfire susceptibility, basal area, canopy cover 
because the majority of trees >20cm in diameter survived. A full restoration treatment 
with thinning to emulate reference conditions and prescribed burning resulted in an area 
much less susceptible to crownfire due to reduced crown bulk density, crown fuel load 
and increased crown base height. A minimum treatment was intermediate, forming a 
continuum of forest conditions.  
 
Wildfires often occur when fuel is dry, fuel consumption greater, and much fuel is 
consumed during the less efficient smoldering stage, resulting in about 2 times as much 
PM10 as prescribed burns. Prescribed burning under favorable dispersion conditions can 
also limit the impact of a wildfire burning through the same area when dispersion 
conditions are poor (Ottmar 1992). Most of the large wildfires in the Flagstaff area burn 
with strong winds resulting in relatively good smoke dispersion.  
 
These model results are intended to support decision-making processes by discussing the 
expected impacts of several available options. One potential problem with relying on a 

 
58
model such as FVS-FFE for long-term predictions is the imprecision of simulation 
results. The purpose of the modeling analysis was not to compare absolute values, but to 
compare management alternatives and trends. As illustrated by our sensitivity analysis, 
the modeling of emission production by the FFE is sensitive to changes in the fuel model 
parameters. However, as discussed by Scott (1998), the internal consistency of a model 
will be more reliable than its accuracy. Thus inaccuracies in the model will have a greater 
effect on absolute values than on the difference between alternative scenarios.  
 
Conclusions 
We found that increased thinning intensity can reduce future emissions by reducing fuel 
inputs from the canopy to the forest floor. However, without burning the fuel reductions 
are short-term. Increasing the return interval of maintenance fires keeps fuels from 
accumulating between burns and reduces the smoke produced in the burns. Total 
emissions produced over time were highest with more frequent burning, but less during 
any one burn.  
 
Structural and functional changes and the resulting high wildfire risk are problems in 
many of the forests throughout much of the Western United States. We illustrated the 
impacts that combinations of thinning intensities and frequencies of prescribed fire may 
have on smoke emissions and fuel hazards. Prescribed burning can greatly reduce fuel 
hazard, but only temporarily. Continual burns are needed to remove the accumulated 
fuels to maintain low fuel hazard. Because fuels are continually entering the surface fuel 
pool, especially needles, hazard reduction must be an ongoing process, and a single fire 

 
59
can only temporarily reduce the hazard. Our simulation found that after 120 years of fire 
exclusion, heavy smoke emissions will result from initial prescribed burns. Subsequent 
burns produce less smoke with each burn, with lower amounts produced by heavier 
thinning intensities and more frequent burning intervals. With more frequent burning, 
less fuel accumulates on the forest floor. Heavier thinning reduces the amount of canopy 
fuel that can fall the forest floor. Over time, more frequent burning will result in more 
cumulative smoke production than a less frequent burn interval, and heavier thinning can 
reduce cumulative smoke. Without burning, fuel loads remain high regardless of thinning 
treatment, although without thinning, they result in very hazardous conditions. 
 
Covington et al. (1994) predicted an acceleration of historic changes in the Inland West 
such as increasing fuel accumulations, longer fire seasons, and intensified burning 
conditions, defining a narrow window of 15-30 years for the implementation of 
restoration treatments. As the scale of disturbance increases, thresholds may be crossed to 
alternative stable states, such as grasslands or shrublands (Savage and Mast 2005). 
However, prescribed fire is an excellent tool for restoring fire-related ecosystems. Just as 
fire is an integral part of the ponderosa pine ecosystems of the Inland West, so is the 
resulting smoke. Our management of prescribed fire smoke will determine the continued 
public acceptance of prescribed burning in the wildland urban interface. Poor smoke 
management can cause health and safety problems for the general public. Flagstaff 
possesses many smoke sensitive areas such as an airport, highways, Flagstaff Medical 
Center, and recreational areas. The preliminary steps of restoration and fuel reduction 
will produce much more smoke than future maintenance, so the question is how much 

 
60
smoke would we accept in order to pass on a landscape with a reduced risk of 
catastrophic wildfire?

Ecological Restoration in Flagstaff’s Wildland-Urban Interface: An 
Intergenerational Justice and Equity Perspective 
 
Abstract 
A variety of management options, many involving prescribed fire, have been proposed as 
methods of restoring ecosystem health and lowering the risk of catastrophic wildfire in 
the WUI areas in the Southwestern US. The current generation’s ability to affect the 
future imposes responsibilities involving issues of sustainability, justice, and equity. This 
paper examines these intergenerational concepts in the context of ecological restoration, 
focusing on the interplay of fire risk, ecological health, and smoke impacts on human 
health. We utilize FVS and SASEM to illustrate the transfers of fire hazards and smoke 
emissions resulting from three prescribed burning intervals (0, 5, and 20 years) applied to 
heavy thin and no thin treatments. We then discuss these results in the context of 
intergenerational equity and justice, utilizing a conservation of options approach. No 
action, represented by unthinned, unburned stands, would result in the transfer of a 
continually degrading ecosystem with high fire risk, which we argue is both unjust and 
unethical. Thinning immediately reduce the risk of active crown fire and in the long-term 
would result in less fuel being added to the forest floor from the canopy. Prescribed fire 
reduces the forest floor fuels that have accumulated over the last 120 years, but will result 
in smoke, with its associated health effects. However, as the landscape moves from 
primarily fuel model 9 into fuel model 2, there is an increasing likelihood of prescribed 
fires violating current air pollution standards. Restoration utilizing thinning and burning 

 
75
would benefit both the current and future generations, and transfer the highest amount of 
natural capital options, but must be balanced against the negative health effects of 
increased smoke.  
 
Introduction 
Our ability to affect future generations imposes an ethical responsibility that involves 
issues of justice and equity (Norton and Toman 1997). The industrial age’s faith in 
progress held that future generations would inherit a world improved by the labor of their 
ancestors (Auerbach 1995). We have recently recognized that the welfare and even the 
existence of future generations can be threatened by public policy. Intergenerational 
ethics addresses how present actions affect future persons and what the present 
generation owes to the future. Within intergenerational ethics, the concept of distributive 
justice focuses on the proper distribution of resources in society over time, while equity 
focuses on decision-making and the fairness of a given distribution (Young 1992). These 
important concepts of justice and equity are interrelated and sometimes overlap.  
 
Sustainability requires that we meet our ethical obligation to transfer assets that provide 
adequate options for future generations, especially by conserving and investing in natural 
capital (Daly 1994, Folke et al. 1994). Once ecosystem assets are damaged, ecological 
restoration attempts to restore their productive capacity. As a result of over a century of 
fire exclusion, ponderosa pine forests throughout the western United States have become 
dense with small trees, herbaceous production has declined, and fuels have accumulated 
on the forest floor. The result is a landscape with a high catastrophic wildfire risk and 

 
76
susceptibility to large-scale pathogen outbreaks (Cooper 1960, Cooper 1961, Covington 
and Moore 1994, Covington et al. 1994, Fulé et al. 1997, Moore et al. 1999). Restoration 
of ponderosa pine ecosystems improves the ecological health and lowers the risk that 
these systems will be lost to the future. The restoration involves the reintroduction of fire, 
with the potential for creating large quantities of pollution. The ethics literature argues 
that natural capital stocks should be maintained for the future (Aerback 1995, Brown 
Weisse 1990, Brown Weisse 1994, Church 1999, Costanza et al. 1997, Cumberland 1991, 
Daly 1994, Norton and Toman 1997, Tacconi 2000, Young 1992), but also asserts that 
subjecting some to pollutions for the benefit of others is neither equitable nor just.  
 
This paper examines these intergenerational concepts in the context of ecological 
restoration, focusing on the interplay of fire risk, ecological health, and smoke impacts on 
human health. We first review intergenerational equity and natural capital concepts. We 
then introduce Southwestern ponderosa pine ecosystems, historic conditions and changes, 
and ecological restoration with specific attention to the forest around Flagstaff, Arizona. 
We then present the methods utilized to model between generational transfers of smoke 
emissions and fuel hazards with alternate management options. Finally, we present the 
results and discuss the intergenerational tradeoffs faced by restoration practitioners.   
 
Literature Review 
Intergenerational Justice and Equity 
The following section briefly discusses intergenerational justice and equity concepts. 
Justice will be defined within an intergenerational context, and several well-known 

 
77
decision rules designed to address intergenerational equity will be outlined. This limited 
review of the concepts is designed to justify the equity approach chosen to discuss 
intergenerational transfers of natural capital in Flagstaff’s WUI. 
 
Justice 
Justice is a culturally defined concept that places boundaries on interpersonal actions 
(Aerback 1995). The concepts of justice imply standards of judgment. By labeling 
something as unjust, a claim is made that is expected to bind the judgments and actions of 
others. It indicates that others of good conscience ought to condemn the action. Matters 
of justice are usually discussed with regards to the current generation (Aerback 1995, 
Barry 1989, Church 1999). It is not often disputed that we have an obligation to act justly 
towards those unable to defend themselves, such as the mentally handicapped. Because 
future generations depend on us and can do us no harm, they fall under a similar 
obligation. Intergenerational justice may be defined as “what we owe to remote (not alive 
at the same time) past and future generations as a matter of justice” (Aerback 1995). Two 
core issues of intergenerational justice are how our actions affect remote generations and 
what we owe to remote generations. The decision must both analyze how it will affect 
remote generations, and include a standard for judging the predicted impacts. Justice is 
based upon doing the analysis; if tradeoffs are not analyzed, there is no justice.  
 
There are two main classes of justice: corrective and distributive (Solum 2001). 
Intergenerational justice is concerned primarily with distributive justice. Barry (1989) 
classified distributive justice into justice as mutual advantage and justice as impartiality. 

 
78
Mutual advantage describes a hypothetical contract based on self-interest. This position 
requires voluntary cooperation, and results in a more even distribution of benefits than if 
parties do not cooperate. Justice as impartiality is not based on self-interest, but rather on 
the idea of an impartial observer. The motive can be either a direct moral concern for 
others, or a concern for the opinion of others. Intergenerational justice must be based on 
impartiality because mutual cooperation between past and future generations cannot 
occur (Church 1999). The impartiality approach must address the problem of accurately 
predicting future needs (Gower 1995). We can only attempt to act justly towards future 
generations, because they may not conceptualize or value justice as we do. Decisions 
made with a moral concern for future generations have to be made with respect to the 
standards of the current generations (Auerbach 1995). Church (1999) argued that forest 
management should include intergenerational justice framework in decision analysis. 
This approach addresses the two previously mentioned core concepts of intergenerational 
justice: 1. the decision must analyze how it affects remote generations, and 2. it must 
include a standard for judging the predicted impact. A forest management decision can be 
considered just if it reflects a moral concern for the welfare of future generations.  
 
Equity  
Equity approaches are decision rules concerned with the consequences of policy 
alternatives and how they affect the distribution of resources, rights, and wealth. The 
neoclassical economic approach to intergenerational equity involves discounting future 
values to the present. This approach assumes that the historic trend of increasing per-
capita income will continue indefinitely. However, convincing arguments exist against 

 
79
utilizing discounting to make provisions for future generations. Howarth and Norgaard 
(1992) demonstrated that the distribution of rights and assets across generations 
determines whether the efficient allocation of resources results in sustainability. They 
demonstrated that the economically efficient allocation changes as the distribution of 
rights changes across generations, and therefore is not an independent criteria for judging 
equity. As asserted by Cumberland (1991), neoclassical economics does not strongly 
support the case for equitable intergenerational transfers of natural resources.  
 
An alternative approach, Rawlsian equity (Rawls 1971, Young 1992), proposes using the 
original position under a veil of ignorance to decide equity questions. People collectively 
decide on societal rules without knowing what position they will occupy in society, or 
what generation they will be part of (Young 1992). From this exercise the principle of 
maxi-min was developed, which emphasizes raising the welfare of the worst off person or 
generation (Costanza et al. 1997). Each policy is analyzed in turn for the worst thing 
(minimum) that could happen if we pursue that policy, and the policy with the largest 
(maximum) minimum is chosen. This approach is useful for deciding on potential 
resource use patterns to be followed to achieve intergenerational equity (Tacconi 2000). 
It cannot provide definitive answers to questions of intergenerational resource 
distribution, because it is impossible to know the exact conditions of sustainability or to 
accurately estimate the welfare, values, and preferences of future generations (Young 
1992). Thus it is biased toward the values of the present generation. It may also entail the 
current generation making a large sacrifice to increase future welfare, which is unlikely to 
occur.

Brown Weiss (1990, 1994) argued that future preference and value assumptions should 
be avoided, and outlined three principles for intergenerational equity decisions: 
conservation of options, conservation of equality, and conservation of access. 
Conservation of options requires each generation to conserve the diversity of the natural 
and cultural resource base so they do not overly restrict future options for solving 
problems and satisfying values, i.e., each generation is entitled to diversity comparable to 
that of previous generations. Other things being equal, more available options increase 
the potential welfare of future generations. To conserve equality, each generation should 
pass on the planet in no worse condition than it received it. To conserve access, each 
generation should provide its members with equitable access rights to the resource base 
and conserve this access for future generations.  
 
Implementing approaches to address intergenerational equity can be problematic. Church 
(1999) argued that a conservation of options approach possesses the most potential for 
incorporating an intergenerational justice framework, as it avoids the necessity of the 
current generation predicting or assuming the values and preferences of future 
generations. We agree and propose that we define management options which represent 
transfers of different levels and qualities of natural capital to future generations.  
 
Natural Capital, Sustainability, and Southwestern Ponderosa Pine Ecosystems 
Economists define capital as a stock that yields a flow of goods or services (Costanza et 
al. 1997). Natural capital consists of assets in the natural world that yield the flow of 

 
81
natural resources consisting of nonrenewable resources, renewable resources, and 
ecosystem services (Daly 1994, Odum 1994). Biodiversity, the diversity of life at all 
levels, is an important attribute of natural capital that contributes to the maintenance of 
ecosystem functions and is a prerequisite for economic adaptability and provides a 
diversity of options for economic development (Tacconi 2000). Humans depend on 
healthy ecosystems for survival, as these systems provide the basis for economic 
development and sustainability (Costanza et al. 1997, Folke et al. 1994, Jasson and 
Jasson 1994).  
 
Sustainable development requires meeting current needs as fully as possible while 
ensuring that the opportunities of future generations are undiminished relative to the 
present (Howarth and Norgaard 1992). Because achievement of sustainability can only be 
recognized in retrospect, and the planning horizon verges upon perpetuity, a great amount 
of uncertainty exists as to what future generations will require in terms of natural capital 
(Cumberland 1991). Given this uncertainty, intergenerational transfers may be required to 
guarantee sustainability and prevent welfare decline of future generations (Costanza et al. 
1997, Cumberland 1991). Natural capital stocks that are transferred can be positive 
transfers, such as intact, large-scale ecosystems, or negative, in the form of degraded 
ecologies and polluted environments. Like human-made capital, natural capital can 
depreciate through use or be conserved and augmented through investment to help keep 
life support ecosystems and interrelated socio-economic systems resilient to change 
(Folke et al. 1994, Segura and Boyce 1994). Divestment occurs when natural capital 

 
82
stocks are liquidated or ecosystem processes are altered. This action reduces future 
options and the ability to benefit from natural capital. 
 
In selecting the stock of environmental resources to transfer, emphasis should be given to 
resources that may be scarce in the future, such as large-scale ecosystems, intact and 
undamaged, with species diversity, complex interspecies relationships, and supporting of 
evolutionary processes to provide for flexibility and adaptability (Costanza et al. 1997, 
Cumberland 1991). Costanza et al. (1997) believed that ecosystem services and other 
forms of natural capital will be in shortest supply in the distant future, and by actively 
transferring these assets we help increase the welfare of the most distant generations. 
Although the functional form of future human welfare production functions is very 
uncertain, one can reasonably assume that the supply of environmental assets will be both 
inelastic, and a source of diminishing returns (Costanza et al. 1997). This is also a 
mechanism for compensating future generations for past ecological damage (Cumberland 
1991). Society has already begun making these transfers by setting aside areas such as 
designated wilderness areas and national parks. In cases where natural capital has been 
degraded, it may be necessary to invest in its restoration.  
 
In the ponderosa pine dominated forests of Flagstaff, Arizona’s WUI, ecological 
restoration attempts to restore the capacity of the system to self-regulate, by recreating 
the forest structure that characterized reference conditions, which allow ecosystem 
processes, especially frequent, low-intensity fires, to resume (Ecological Restoration 
Institute 2000). Combining prescribed fire with structural restoration alters fire behavior, 

 
83
reducing the risk of crown fires and producing an increase in herbaceous productivity and 
old growth tree response (Covington et al. 1997, Covington and Moore 1994, Fulé et al. 
2001, Kolb et al. 2001). In fire adapted ecosystems, prescribed fire reduces fuel hazards 
and produces other effects which mechanical or chemical treatments cannot fully imitate 
(USDA FS 1993). The use of fire produces smoke, which constrains its use as a 
management tool. When prescribed fire is considered for fuel management, it is 
necessary to consider the production and effects of smoke.  
 
Methods 
Our analysis addresses the approximately 180,000-acre landscape delineated as the 
greater Flagstaff wildland-urban interface (Grand Canyon Forest Partnership 2000). 
Flagstaff, AZ, is located in the largest contiguous ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) 
forest in the world. Flagstaff, founded in 1881, has experienced rapid growth in recent 
years. The population in was 52,894 in 2000, and was estimated to have reached 55,173 
by 2002 (www.epodunk.com). Most of the growth involves expansion of suburban 
developments into previous forested areas and meadows, such as the community of 
Kachina Village. The Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) exists as a continuum where 
urban areas mix with the forest (Feary and Neuenschwander 1998). Large severe fires are 
especially destructive in the interface between wildlands and communities, as exampled 
by the Cerro Grande Fire in Los Alamos, NM in 2000 (US DOI 2000). Flagstaff’s urban 
area lies within the WUI, and is at risk of destruction from wildfire. About 600 wildfires 
per year occur in the Flagstaff area (Grand Canyon Forest Partnership 2000).  
 

 
84
Flagstaff’s WUI contains chaparral, desert scrub, grassland, mixed conifer, 
pinyon/juniper, ponderosa pine, ponderosa pine/Gambel oak, urban and water, and 
riparian ecological types (Figure 3.1) (USDA FS 2000c). The chaparral, desert scrub, 
grassland, pinyon/juniper, urban and water, and riparian types were excluded from 
analysis, based on the assumption that restoration treatments in these types are not 
priority. Only the ponderosa pine and ponderosa pine/Gambel oak types were utilized in 
this analysis, as these vegetation types are the most likely to be at high risk of losing one 
or more key components of their ecology. As illustrated by Figure 3.2 and Table 3.1, the 
majority of the WUI’s ponderosa pine and ponderosa pine/Gambel oak are in the 0-35 
year fire return interval and currently at high risk, almost a third is in the moderate risk 
category, and a small percentage are in the low risk category and the 35-100 year return 
interval high risk category (USDA FS 2000b).  
 
Estimation of Restoration Impacts: Fuel Hazard and Smoke 
The reduction of fuel hazards is the primary impetus behind thinning and burning 
treatments in Flagstaff’s WUI. The effectiveness of these treatments lies in their ability to 
not only reduce fuel loads in the short-term, but to keep fuels low, and thereby reducing 
fire hazards and risk to the community into the future. Treatment effectiveness can be 
discussed using changes in fuel load and model, which relate to risk of catastrophic loss, 
and can be altered in a variety of ways such as varying prescriptions of thinning and 
burning.  
 

 
85
However, smoke from prescribed burning poses a relevant and serious threat to public 
health. This threat is related to the quantity and concentration of smoke, the various 
chemical species, and particulate matter size (Koenig et al. 1988, Morgan 1989). In this 
study, we are focusing on the various fractions of particulate matter, especially PM2.5 
and PM10, that pose significant health risks, and are monitored by the US Environmental 
Protection Agency (United States Environmental Protection Agency 1997). Generally, 
70% of wood smoke particulates are <2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5), 20% between 2.5 
and 10 microns (PM10), and 10% are greater than 10 microns (Morgan 1989). We will 
address both PM10 and PM2.5, because PM10 can penetrate the respiratory tract, and 
PM2.5 is small enough to reach the alveolar region of the lungs and also has the 
maximum effect on visibility. We will then briefly address the health effects of several 
other smoke constituents in the discussion.  
 
Simulation of Restoration Treatments 
We modeled changes in fire risk (fuel loading and fuel model) and smoke particulate 
matter using the Central Rockies Variant of the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) 
(Dixon 2001, Wykoff et al. 1982). The Fire and Fuels Extension (FFE) integrates FVS 
with elements from existing fire behavior and effects models to simulate fire effects, fuel 
loading, and snag dynamics (Beukema et al. 1998). The model calculates smoke 
production (PM2.5 and PM10) using emission factors applied to the amount of fuel 
consumed.  
 

 
86
Input data were based on restoration treatments conducted on the Fort Valley 
Experimental Forest. Two initial conditions and four burning cycles were simulated to 
develop per acre level of outputs. The original restoration treatments incorporated two 
intermediate thinning treatments, however, we have limited our investigation to the two 
extremes. The full restoration (heavy thin) treatment and control (no thin) were replicated 
three times using a block design. We used tree and fuel loading data collected on twenty 
plots in each replica to initialize the restoration simulations. (Table 3.2 illustrates initial 
and post treatment condition of the treatments simulated.) The heavy thin (full 
restoration) treatment leaves all presettlement trees and 1.5-3 postsettlement replacement 
trees for each evidence of a dead presettlement tree. The no thin treatment retained dense 
stands of small trees with interspersed yellow pines.  
 
Simulations were initiated with the post-treatment conditions and run for 80 years with 
varying prescribed fire intervals: 0 (no prescribed fire), 5, and 20 years. Simulations were 
individually run on each of the twenty plots representing the initial condition, and the 
results were averaged. The 5-year interval is within the historic range of variability for 
most Northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests (2-8 years) (Fulé et al. 1997, Moore et al. 
1999). The 20-year interval is included to look at a longer interval that may serve the 
management goal of reducing fire hazard, and is within the 2-20 year range of variability 
for all Southwest ponderosa pine forests (Swetnam and Baisan 1996). Prescribed fires 
were simulated using 3-foot flame lengths, throttle-back burn, and no crowning. To 
compare the effects of thinning on fuel loads we simulated the stands with fire exclusion. 
These treatment combinations were chosen to represent several options available for use 

 
87
in Flagstaff’s WUI (Table 3.3) (USDA FS 1998, USDA FS 2000a). Outputs included PM 
10, PM 2.5, fuel load (total, 100-hour, 1000-hour, litter, and duff), and fuel model 
(Anderson 1982).  
 
We utilized the per acre results given by FVS, and extrapolated out to the WUI as 
previously defined to estimate the percent of the landscape in each model, and the PM 
emitted at year 1, 5, 20, and 80. (Chapter 2 discusses the stand level results.) These four 
time periods provide excellent illustrations of the scale of change over time. We 
compared a heavy thin treatment burned at 5 year intervals and implemented in 5 years, a 
heavy thin treatment burned at 20 year intervals implemented in 20 years, and an 
unthinned, unburned control scenario. We will not discuss fire only treatments, because 
local, long-term experimentation has indicated that burning alone is unlikely to restore 
the natural forest structure of ponderosa pine forests in the study region (Covington and 
Sackett 1992, Fulé et al. 2002, Harrington and Sackett 1990).  
 
We utilized the Simple Approach Smoke Estimation Model (SASEM) (Sestak and 
Riebau 1988) as a means to address smoke impacts and equity concerns. SASEM utilizes 
a straight line Gaussian plume model and emissions based on the Emission Production 
Model (EPM) (Sandberg and Peterson 1984) or internal algorithms. The model assumes 
meteorological conditions do not change, that atmospheric distributions can be estimated 
by point values, and that a fixed ratio of smoke entrained in a plume to unentrained is 
60:40. SASEM estimates maximum ground-level concentrations of TPM, PM 10, and 

 
88
PM 2.5, the distances at which this concentration would occur, and the range of distance 
over which ambient standards would be exceeded.  
 
The PM 2.5 national ambient air quality standards are 65 ug/m3 and 15.0 ug/m3 for 24-
hours and annually, and the PM10 standards are 150 ug/m3 and 50 ug/m3 for 24-hours 
and annually (US EPA 1997). The 24-hour standards were used in the simulation; 150 
ug/m3 for TSP and PM10, and 65 ug/m3 for PM2.5. Potential PM10 and PM2.5 
concentrations were calculated by SASEM for excellent to poor atmospheric stability 
(ventilation index) for 50 acres of heavy thin or unthinned stands for 5 and 20 year 
burning intervals. The 50 acres were chosen to represent the generalized upper area 
allowed by the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (1996) before special 
measures must be taken. We utilized three fuel models to represent current and potential 
future conditions. While FVS utilizes Anderson’s (1982) fuel models, SASEM utilizes 
NFDRS (Bradshaw et al 1984, Deeming et al. 1977) fuel models for default fuel 
parameters. Fuel model C typifies open pine stands where grasses and forbs are the 
primary ground fuel along with needles and branches, and correspond to Anderson’s 
(1982) fire behavior model 2. Fuel model K describes slash from light thinnings where 
slash is scattered under an open overstory, which relates well to post-thinning conditions 
and Anderson’s fuel model 11. Fuel model U describes closed stands of pines, which 
relates well to unthinned stands, and relates to Anderson’s (1982) fuel model 9. The 
conditions utilized for the SASEM simulation are illustrated in Appendix I.  
 

 
89
Results  
We approached the risk of catastrophic fire by utilizing fuel hazard as described by fuel 
load and fuel model (both Anderson and NFDRS). Our results for fuel loads and models 
were consistent with both experimental observations (Sackett and Haase 1998) and 
computer simulations (Covington et al. 2001) of the study area (see Chapter 2 for a 
discussion of stand level results). All fuels were reduced with burning, followed by a 
subsequent rise (see Chapter 2, Figure 2.1a-e). Thinning and the amount of time between 
burns determined the magnitude of fuel accumulation. There was a clear difference 
between the no thin and the heavy thin treatments, as thinning serves to reduce future 
available fuel. Burning on a 5-year interval does not allow much fuel build-up on any 
unit, even the unthinned stands, while a 20-year interval allows time for a larger fuel 
buildup.  
 
The fuel model mode of untreated stands began at fuel model 9, while heavy thinning 
resulted in a fuel model mode of 2 (Table 3.4). Outliers of fuel models 10 and 12 were 
also observed. Unthinned, unburned stands changed into fuel model 10 by year 40. 
Burning unthinned stands allows the fuel model to remain at 9, with 5 year burning 
eventually reaching fuel model 2. Thinning and burning at 5-year intervals resulted in a 
fuel model of 2 through year 80. Thinning and burning at 20-year intervals also resulted 
in a fuel model mode of 2, however, the maximum fuel model was 9 and 10. Thinning 
followed by no burning resulted in a mode fuel model of 2, with maximums of 10 and 12.  
 

 
90
The no action alternative was represented by the unthinned, unburned stands in our 
simulation. This option would allow dense stands persist, continually increasing amounts 
of both the fine fuels which increase fire ignitability and rate-of-spread and the large fuels 
and duff which contribute to smoke emissions (Table 3.5). These conditions contribute to 
an increasing risk of catastrophic wildfire and the potential of much higher smoke 
emissions as the landscape moves from predominantly fuel model 9 into fuel models 10 
and 12. As the amount of thinning and burning increases across the landscape, more of 
the landscape is moved into fuel model 2 (Table 3.5). The speed at which restoration is 
implemented affects the speed of movement into fuel model 2, retention in fuel model 9, 
or movement into more hazardous fuel models (Table 3.5). Heavy thinning, with a 20-
year fire return interval implemented over a 20 year period would result in fuel model 2 
covering the majority of the WUI in 20 years. Increasing the rate of thinning and burning 
will result in a lower landscape-level fire hazard, as illustrated with the 5-year 
implementation and fire return interval. However, increased burning will lead to 
increased smoke in the atmosphere, as illustrated in Table 3.6.  
 
Thinning and fire return interval affected the pattern of smoke emissions (Table 3.5; see 
Chapter 2, Figure 2.2a-e,). Initial per acre emissions were high, but decreased with 
repeated burning as fuel loads decreased. Thinning resulted in lower future emissions per 
acre burned, because less canopy was available to drop fuels. By year 80, emissions for 
the no thin treatments were approximately twice as high as the heavy thin treatments. The 
frequency of the fire return interval produced quantitative differences in emissions. More 
frequent burning resulted in lower emissions per acre when burned than a less frequent 

 
91
interval; a result of less fuel accumulating between burns. Although increased frequency 
of prescribed burning resulted in lower emissions by the second burn, this resulted in 
higher cumulative emissions (see Chapter 2, Figure 2.3a-e). The relative effects are such 
that the unthinned stands burned on 20-year intervals produce approximately as much 
cumulative PM as the heavy thin stands burned on 5-year intervals.  
 
Stand level emissions of PM were shown to differ dramatically with thinning and burning 
interval (Table 3.5; Chapter 2, Figures 3.4a-b). The SASEM predicted maximum 
concentrations and exceedences of the national ambient air quality standards for TPM, 
PM 10, and PM 2.5 are depicted in Appendix I. When burning 50 acres of fuel model K, 
TPM, PM 10, and PM 2.5 standards were exceeded only during poor stability conditions. 
In fuel model U, TPM and PM 2.5 standards were exceeded during poor stability 
conditions, while PM 10 standards were exceeded during poor stability conditions at 
wind speeds <4 mi/hr. However, burning 50 acres of fuel model C resulted in both TPM 
and PM 2.5 exceeding the standards at most combinations of wind speed and stability, 
while PM 10 standards were exceeded during poor stability and wind speed < 5 mi/hr. 
Fuel model C burned under non-poor stability conditions was predicted to exceed 
standards primarily between 0.5 and 2 miles, allowing for a high potential to affect 
human health. The exceedence distances predicted under poor stability were large for 
each fuel model, often exceeding 13 miles.  
 
Although FVS modeled the areas restored with heavy thinning and frequent burning to 
emit lower quantities of PM, the SASEM results indicated that burning these areas could 

 
92
result in more frequently exceeding air quality standards than either the initial burns or 
burning with a longer fire return interval. Fuel model C resulted in more potential 
violations of air quality standards than fuel model K or U, differing in the lower heat 
content of the fuel, lower heat release rate, smaller fireline width, and increased number 
of smoke plumes (Appendix 1). The increased conditions over which standards are 
exceeded decrease the ability to time prescribed burns.   
 
Discussion 
Ecological restoration attempts to improve the natural capital which is passed to future 
generations as an intergenerational transfer. Ecological restoration in Flagstaff’s WUI, 
and generally throughout the fire-adapted ecosystems of the West, involves 
reintroduction of fire, which produces smoke. Restoration changes the risk of property 
damage and ecosystem loss. In order to be considered just, we must analyze both the 
positive and negative effects (tradeoffs) these actions have on current and future 
generations, and include a standard for judging the predicted impacts. Here, we discuss 
the tradeoffs in terms of options that the current generation can pass on to the future, 
including the fire hazard and fire risk; intergenerational transfers of smoke, with the 
associated potential for health impacts; and intact ecosystems providing ecosystem 
services, such as biodiversity and nutrient cycling. The management options discussed 
represent transfers of different levels and qualities of this natural capital to future 
generations.  
 

 
93
Full restoration with 5-year fire return intervals implemented as rapidly as possible (here 
within 5 years) would entail heavy thinning throughout the WUI and burning on 
approximately 5 year intervals indefinitely into the future. This option would result in the 
highest and most rapid return on the investment by rapidly reducing fire hazard and 
increasing ecosystem health. Experimental observations of restoration treatments have 
shown ecological benefits rapidly accrue, including increased herbaceous production 
(Covington et al. 1997), increased tree growth, increased carbon and nitrogen uptake, 
increased insect resistance (Feeney et al. 1998), and increased soil respiration rates and N 
transformation (Covington and Sackett 1986, Kaye and Hart 1998a, b). The increase in 
herbaceous understory production is important for its contribution to biodiversity, as it 
represents the majority of the plant species diversity. The understory ecosystem 
component also restrains tree regeneration, and its diversity and biomass are important 
for many ecosystem components and processes, including surface fire propagation and 
pollinators (Allen et al. 2002). However, the cost to both the current and future 
generations may be the highest with respect to the potential costs of smoke emitted from 
the fires. One of the costs of the smoke may be an increased cost of health care in the 
future.  
 
As illustrated with SASEM, as the fuel models change from closed stands and heavy fuel 
loads to open stands dominated by grass, ground level concentrations of smoke may 
actually increase during burns, leading to unhealthy smoke exposures. The low intensity 
burns fail to develop strong convection columns and smoke is dispersed locally 

 
94
(Reinhardt and Ottmar 1997). Higher intensity fires tend to develop enough heat to pull 
the smoke away.  
 
Fulé et al. (2001, 2002) found that forest restoration treatments of thinning young trees 
followed by prescribed burning resulted in significantly lower stand density, lower crown 
fuel load, and higher crown base height than untreated stands. Simulated fire under 
extreme weather conditions caused 48% more canopy burning and higher flame lengths, 
heat/area, and rate of spread in untreated stands. Wind speeds required for passive crown 
fire (torching) were twice as high in treated stands. In a landscape dominated by fuel 
model 2 (grass and timber litter, Anderson 1982), forest structures are open and 
dominated by large, fire resistant trees with few shrubs or small trees to act as ladder fuel. 
In these conditions, torching is rare and active crownfire almost impossible. This allows a 
much wider prescription window than denser stands because the risk of intense fire 
behavior is low, allowing a greater ability to plan for smoke dispersion and minimize 
smoke episodes.  
 
Flagstaff possesses good air quality at the present time, except when burning results in 
smoke episodes. Robinson et al. (2004) found that background PM2.5 concentrations 
ranged from 19 to 69 ug/m3. As an air pollutant, smoke affects both workers (firefighters, 
burning crews) and the general public. Because the WUI is by definition close to homes, 
burning would likely result in episodes of unhealthy smoke exposure. By instituting 
large-scale, long-term burning programs, we are instituting the long-term exposure of 
people to substances which are linked to short- and long-term health problems, including 

 
95
asthma and cancer. In this paper, we are primarily concerned with particulate matter, 
although other hazardous components of wood smoke include carbon monoxide 
(Reinhart and Ottmar 2000), irritants such as aldehydes (Koenig et al. 1988, Reinhart and 
Ottmar 2000), and mutagenic and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(Koenig et al. 1988, Morgan 1989). PM10 is collected in the upper respiratory system 
(throat and nose), and can enter the lower respiratory system, reaching deeper with 
reduced size. The finest PM can deposit in the alveoli and remain indefinitely, causing 
structural and chemical changes. In addition, other toxic and mutagenic compounds 
attached to the PM can enter at the same time (Koenig et al. 1988, Morgan 1989). 
Prescribed burns in the Flagstaff area produce PM2.5 with high organic carbon levels 
(>90% by mass), as well as K+, NH4+, and NO3-, chlorine, sulfur, and silicon, titanium 
and chromium (Robinson et al. 2004). The primary acute effects of ambient PM include 
premature mortality, aggravation of respiratory and cardiovascular disease (indicated by 
increased hospital admissions and emergency room visits, school absences, lost work 
days, and restricted activity days), aggravated asthma, acute respiratory symptoms 
(aggravated coughing and difficult or painful breathing), chronic bronchitis, eye 
irritation, and decreased lung function often experienced as shortness of breath (Morgan 
1989, Pierson et al. 1989, Reinhart and Ottmar 2000). Pierson et al. (1989) found that for 
every 100 ug/m3 of TPM in the environment, the risk of dying goes up 32% from 
emphysema, 19% from bronchitis and asthma, 12% from pneumonia, and 9% from 
cardiovascular disease. Schwartz (1993) found an average 6% increase in mortality and 
an 18.5% increase in respiratory hospital emissions for every 50 ug/m3 of TPM.  
 

 
96
Robinson et al. (2004) collected PM2.5 samples during first entry burns and a 
maintenance burn in primarily grassland fuel near Flagstaff, Arizona. During first entry 
burns, ambient concentrations of PM2.5 within the burned area ranged from 2541 and 
6459 ug/m3 during the flaming stage, while the concentration during the maintenance fire 
was 523 ug/m3. Smoldering particle concentrations were lower (155-904 ug/m3), but 
began within 4 hours of ignition and continued for several days. These concentrations 
would decrease with mixing as distance form the burn increased. However, as described 
above, these emissions may be high enough to have a significant effect on the health of 
Flagstaff’s citizens and visitors.  
 
The health effects of wood smoke are not only relevant outdoors, as most people spend 
80-90% of their time indoors (Pierson et al. 1989). Smaller smoke particles remain 
suspended for long periods of time and about 50-70% of outdoor wood smoke penetrates 
into buildings. Unusually sensitive members of the population such as those with 
underlying respiratory or cardiovascular disease may be unable to tolerate additional 
stress imposed by smoke exposure (Morgan 1989). Infants, children, pregnant women, 
senior citizens, smokers, ex-smokers, and those suffering from allergies, asthma, 
bronchitis, emphysema, pneumonia, or any other heart or lung illness are sensitive to low 
levels of smoke. In Coconino county there are an estimated 931 people with emphysema, 
4,410 with chronic bronchitis, 6,855 with adult asthma, and 2,908 cases of pediatric 
asthma (American Lung Association 2003). These groups must receive special attention 
in assessing smoke risk, because not to do so would be unjust, as they are relatively less 

 
97
capable of defending themselves against the negative effects of smoke. A lack of 
consideration would also violate the equity premises of equality and access.  
 
The impacts could be minimized and dispersed in several ways. Thinning could be 
minimized in terms of thinning intensity or how quickly the initial thinning treatments are 
accomplished, spreading the initial cost of investment in the natural capital restoration 
farther over time. Reduced thinning intensity would provide minimal initial crown fire 
resistance, and allow the canopy to close faster and higher fuel inputs to the forest floor, 
allowing hazardous conditions to rapidly return (Covington et al. 2001, Fulé et al. 2001, 
Fulé et al. 2002). By thinning at a slower pace (20-year implementation period), costs 
could be spread out, but high fire hazards would persist over the landscape for a longer 
time period with the potential of much higher costs associated with catastrophic wildfire. 
These options do not appear optimal in terms of maximizing the transfer of options to the 
future.  
 
The current generation could increase burning intervals (20 years), resulting in lower 
cumulative smoke emissions than short burning intervals (5 years). Increased burn 
intervals allow more time for fuel to accumulate, leading to a higher fire risk between 
burns and more smoke when the stand is burned. As illustrated with FVS and SASEM, 
these changes in fuel hazard are of small magnitude and may be better in terms of health 
impacts and reduce the risk of exceeding air quality standards. The smaller annual 
number of prescribed burns could be implemented during the best possible dispersion 
conditions, thereby reducing impacts to sensitive individuals.  

 
98
 
Doing nothing is a policy decision, and it may have a worse effect on future generations 
than any other option. This is especially true for Flagstaff’s WUI. The possibility that 
large-scale restoration treatments will not occur is an option by inaction, which would 
allow the continued decline of the forest’s ecological health, measured by structure and 
function. In a landscape dominated by untreated stands, with high vertical and horizontal 
fuel continuity, low crown base height, and high canopy density, passive and active 
crownfires are likely in the dry fire conditions characteristic of spring and early summer. 
High fire risk would continue indefinitely, if protected from allogenic disturbance, or 
until the occurrence of a stand-replacing disturbance, resulting in acutely high smoke 
emissions and ecosystem damage. Crownfires are likely even under average prescribed 
fire conditions. For this reason, introducing fire into unthinned stands is not a good 
management alternative for Flagstaff’s WUI.  
 
In addition, understory vegetation in unthinned stands will continue to decline, as it has 
since fire exclusion began with the subsequent increase in overstory density and heavy 
forest floor accumulations (Biswell 1972 , Cooper 1960). There is a concern that the very 
low decomposition rate in absence of fire reduces productivity and nutrient cycling by 
binding nitrogen in forms unavailable for plant uptake (Arnold 1950, Cooper 1960, 
Biswell 1972, Harrington and Sackett 1992). If we do nothing, future generations will 
endure the cost of fire suppression, poor ecosystem health, and wildfire smoke 
production. The ecosystem may even be irreversibly changed or lost. Thus, the current 
ecosystem appears to be a poor choice for transfer to future generations, and the no action 

 
99
alternative would appear to be unjust and unethical, by both the conservation of options 
standard and the Rawlsian standard. With the potential loss of ecological function the 
current generation is not acting to conserve the natural resource base and there are 
reduced choices over time. Therefore the conservation of options standard is not met. 
Because the window of opportunity for restoration is shrinking (15 – 30 years) 
(Covington et al. 1994) and the fire risk will continue to increase until a catastrophic fire 
removes the fuel load, each consecutive generation is worse off. Therefore the Rawlsian 
standard is failed. However, there is ample evidence that we can restore the WUI 
specifically, and the short-interval fire adapted ecosystems of the west in general, to a 
condition in which there is a lower fire risk as well as ability to persist as it did for at least 
300-500 years before Euro-American settlement.  
 
If burned in a wildfire, smoke emissions may be worse than with prescribed fire. 
Wildfires generally occur when fuels are dry, consumption greater, and more fuel is 
consumed during the less efficient smoldering combustion stage resulting in 
approximately twice the PM10 of a prescribed fire (Pyne et al. 1996). Prescribed fires are 
planned in advance and can be ignited when dispersion is best, so fuel is consumed with 
more efficiency and less smoke production than wildfires (Pyne et al. 1996). The area 
burned with a prescribed fire can also be controlled; wildfires generally burn a much 
larger area. Fuel treatments which alter height-to-crown ratio and the abundance and 
continuity of canopy fuels have been shown to moderate extreme fire behavior (Omi and 
Martinson 2002). Altering the fuel model of the WUI with thinning and burning 
treatments will not prevent wildfire from occurring but will reduce the associated risks.

According to Daly (1994), “investing in natural capital is a prerequisite for 
sustainability”. Ecological restoration of natural capital should be considered an 
important component for any sustainable development strategy designed to be proof 
against risk, both future and present. While the decision to restore Flagstaff’s WUI is 
primarily based on the intragenerational concerns of wildfire risk and ecological values, 
the effects will extend into future generations. Before we implement a policy we need to 
consider its effects on the future, because some policies will only be reversible at high 
cost to future generations, if they are reversible at all (Auerbach 1995). If we are going to 
be just, we must concern ourselves with and address future impacts of current 
management. In addition, each future generation is better off if there is continued 
maintenance in the present. We can help insure the continued maintenance of our natural 
capital by acting in such a way that “future generations are most likely to honor the 
commitments and build upon the moral traditions of their ancestors” (Auerbach 1995). If 
we establish a tradition of acting justly towards future generations, it is likely that the 
next generation will also act justly towards the future.  
 
In conducting this discussion of tradeoffs with a focus on intergenerational justice and 
equity, we have taken a step towards acting justly towards the future, as well as the 
present. This document is not meant as a planning document, but as an aid to planning 
efforts.  Restoration treatment location and scheduling should be and will continue to be 
an exercise in adaptive management. We have presented and argument that justice and 
equity need to characterize the appropriateness of the intergenerational transfer of natural 

 
101
capital in the Flagstaff WUI utilizing the chosen equity approach. The final decision is up 
to society. However, as stated by Auerbach (1995), “It is not enough to understand how 
we ought to act, we must actually act that way”.

Overall Conclusions 
 
Structural and functional changes and the resulting high wildfire risk are problems in 
many of the forests throughout much of the Western United States. These problems are 
especially pronounced in the wildland-urban interface (WUI). Focusing on the WUI of 
Flagstaff, AZ, we have analyzed how several management options consisting of different 
thinning intensities and burning intervals would likely affect both the current and remote 
generations, and included a standard for judging the predicted impacts. As previously 
stated, justice is based upon doing the analysis; if the tradeoffs are not analyzed, there is 
no justice. We chose a conservation of options approach for discussing intergenerational 
equity issues, focusing on the interplay of fire risk, ecological health, and smoke impacts 
on human health.  
 
The no treatment option would transfer the least options to the future in terms of natural 
capital, and therefore is both unjust and unethical to the future as well as the present. 
Thinning immediately reduce the risk of active or passive crown fire and in the long-term 
would result in less fuel being added to the forest floor from the canopy, reducing future 
emissions. However, without burning the fuel reductions are short-term. Prescribed 
burning can greatly reduce fuel hazard, but only temporarily. Because fuels are 
continually entering the surface fuel pool, especially needles, hazard reduction must be an 
ongoing process, and a single fire can only temporarily reduce the hazard. In addition, the 
use of fire will produce smoke, with its associated health effects. Although FVS modeled 

 
118
the areas restored with heavy thinning and frequent burning to emit lower quantities of 
PM, the SASEM results indicated that burning these areas could result in more frequently 
exceeding air quality standards than either the initial burns or burning with a longer fire 
return interval. Restoration utilizing thinning and burning would benefit both the current 
and future generations, and transfer the highest amount of natural capital options, but 
must be balanced against the negative health effects of increased smoke.  
 
As we have illustrated, models can be useful for exploring risks and tradeoffs. However, 
they are only approximations of reality and are subject to different degrees of uncertainty 
and error, adding an element of risk to decisions based upon modeling exercises. 
Uncertainties abound when the potential for smoke impacts, escaped prescribed fires, and 
changes in ecological health are considered, but ought to be compared to the certainty of 
lost ecological, economic, and social values from catastrophic wildfires in these fire-
prone ecosystems. 
 
Because future generations are unlikely to conceptualize or value justice as we do, we 
can only attempt to act justly towards toward them.  Thus decisions made with a moral 
concern for future generations will be made with respect to the standards of the current 
generations (Auerbach 1995). Auerbach (1995) argued that “we ought to act toward 
future generations in such a way that future generations are most likely to honor the 
commitments and build upon the moral traditions of their ancestors.” This recognizes the 
intergenerational nature of civilization and is especially meaningful for those concerned 
with the judgment of history. If we establish a tradition of acting justly towards future 

 
119
generations, it is likely that the next generation will also act justly towards the future. A 
moral obligation to act justly will not be created unless concern for the future is 
transformed into action. “The fact that proposed actions so strongly emphasize restoration 
of native biological diversity reflect high value placed on ecological integrity by 
Flagstaff’s community” (Covington et al. 1998).  
 
While the decision to restore Flagstaff’s WUI is primarily based on the intragenerational 
concerns of wildfire risk and ecological values, the effects will extent into future 
generations. Planning effective means for making transfers to future generations must be 
centered no only upon monetary and fiscal measures, but more importantly upon real 
resources relevant to ecological sustainability, especially large-scale complex ecologies. 
Ecological restoration offers an excellent way to repair damaged capital before it 
depreciates beyond use. With these two manuscripts, we have attempted to illustrate that 
any action is better for current and future generations than no action at all. Just as fire is 
an integral part of the ponderosa pine ecosystems of the Inland West, so is the resulting 
smoke.
