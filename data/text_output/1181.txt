The Ecological Restoration Institute is dedicated to the restoration of fire-adapted forests and woodlands. ERI provides services that support the social and economic vitality of com-
munities that depend on forests and the natural resources and ecosystem services they provide. Our efforts focus on science-based research of ecological and socio-economic issues 
related to restoration as well as support for on-the-ground treatments, outreach and education.

Calculating the Full Costs of the 2010 Schultz Fire: A Ten-Year Review

Introduction 
The 2010 Schultz Fire was ignited by an abandoned campfire on June 20 and burned 15,075 acres 
northeast of Flagstaff, Arizona. Following the fire, intense monsoon rains over the burned area produced 
flooding that resulted in extensive damage. In 2013, a full-cost accounting was conducted to estimate costs 
for the first three years following the fire (Combrink et al. 2013). We conducted a partial remeasurement 
after ten years to re-evaluate those costs and better understand the long-term economic, ecological, and 
social effects of a major wildfire and post-fire flooding. 
  
Methods 
The remeasurement of the full-cost accounting study by Combrink et al. (2013) included: 1) updating 
government and utility expenditures; 2) surveying affected households to determine long-term costs and 
experiences; 3) re-evaluating ecosystem service costs from impacts to Mexican spotted owl (MSO) habitat; 
and 4) updating other costs from Combrink et al. (2013) (including structural damage, cleanup, unpaid labor, 
home contents, fire evacuation costs, and loss of life) to account for inflation to 2021 dollars. Cost 
remeasurements from the 2020 household survey focused on flood insurance costs and claims and the costs 
of preventative measures and upkeep of those measures. 
 
Key Research Findings 
Costs associated with the Schultz Fire and flooding continued to accrue over ten years, although at a 
slower rate than during the first analysis. In the current study, the total cost of the Schultz Fire for the ten-
year assessment period was conservatively estimated to be approximately $111 million in 2021 dollars 
(Table 1). This represents a 29%–35% increase in the respective range of costs from 2013. These costs 
represent some of the more complex and difficult-to-measure costs of wildfire and post-fire flooding.  
 
The largest costs were incurred by government and utility entities. Coconino County and the US 
Department of Agriculture Forest Service bore the largest expenses. The government and utility expenses 
were largely incurred between 2010 and 2015, though the most expensive mitigation project was in 2015. 
The reanalysis of costs associated with habitat loss of MSO benefited from 10 years of data collection.  
Although MSO habitat was severely burned, no MSO were lost, and there was a reduction in total habitat 
and a displacement of the existing owls to nearby suitable habitat.  
 
The ten-year remeasurement highlighted that indirect costs (those that accrue after a fire is contained, not 
including the direct costs of fire suppression and loss of MSO habitat) continued to accrue for ten years. 
For the Schultz Fire, 89% of costs were indirect costs, with 10% of costs for fire suppression and 1% for 
lost MSO habitat. It may take a minimum of 3–5 years following a fire to understand the full costs of a 
single event (Figure 1).

Adverse effects to resident well-being that were documented in the 2020 survey are not quantified but also 
represent significant costs that continued to accrue over time. Surveyed households in 2020, a decade after 
the fire, indicated that they were still experiencing long-term well-being and mental health effects. Namely, 
25% of survey respondents shared that the Schultz Fire and subsequent flooding has caused significant stress, 
while just under 20% agreed that their mental health has 
suffered because of fire or flooding. There was also a decline in 
respondents who said they were purchasing flood insurance 
over time. 
 
We also estimated the potential cost savings that could have 
been incurred by treating a portion of the Schultz Fire footprint. 
Using information from the Jack Smith/Schultz Project, which 
was planned but not implemented prior to the fire, we estimated 
that treatments could have potentially averaged $12.5 million. 
Using the updated estimates of the total long-term costs of the 
Schultz Fire of $111 million, we estimated a full cost of $7,345 
per acre, which is 4.5 times the proposed cost of restoration.  
Conclusions and Considerations for Wildfire Full-Cost Accounting 
We conservatively estimated that the total costs of the 2010 Schultz Fire for the period 2010–2021 was 
approximately $111 million in 2021 dollars. Events like the 2010 Schultz Fire and post-fire flooding can 
have long-lasting effects that often go undocumented. These include long-term financial costs, but also 
effects that are more difficult to quantify such as decreases in local ecosystem services and societal costs 
like community well-being. Long-term studies that examine the ongoing costs of a major wildfire are 
important to understand the true scope and scale of the effects of uncharacteristic wildfire and post-fire 
flooding. Studies such as this can provide further justification for the importance of proactive forest 
restoration and fuel reduction treatments to reduce the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire to ecosystems and 
communities.
