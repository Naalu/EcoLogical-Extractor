Intra- and Interannual Vegetation Change:
Implications for Long-Term Research
Julie E. Korb1,2 and Peter Z. Fule´3
Abstract
To draw reliable conclusions from forest restoration ex-
periments, it is important that long-term measurements be
repeatable or year-to-year variability may interfere with
the correct interpretation of treatment effects. We used
permanent plots in a long-term restoration study in south-
western Colorado to measure herbaceous and shrub vege-
tation at three dates within a single year (June, July, and
August), and between years (2003 and 2005), on untreated
control plots in a warm, dry mixed conifer forest. Growing
season precipitation patterns were similar between 2003
and 2005, so differences in vegetation should be related
primarily to differences in the sampling month. Signiﬁcant
indicator species for each sampling month were present
within a single year (2005), primarily reﬂecting early-sea-
son annuals. We found no signiﬁcant differences for total
species abundance (2005). Species richness, abundance,
and indicator species were signiﬁcantly different between
years for different sampling months indicating that sam-
pling should be conducted within a similar time frame to
avoid detecting differences that are not due to treatment
effects or variations in year-to-year climate. These ﬁnd-
ings have implications for long-term research studies
where the objectives are to detect changes over time in
response to treatments, climate variation, and natural pro-
cesses. Long-term sampling should occur within a similar
phenological time frame each year over a short amount of
time and should be based on the following criteria: (1) the
sampling period is congruent with research objectives
such as detecting rare species or peak understory abun-
dance and (2) the sampling period is feasible in regard to
personnel and ﬁnancial constraints.
Key words: forest ecology, herbaceous, methodology,
monitoring, plant community dynamics, succession.
Introduction
Long-term ecological research is necessary to understand
how vegetation structure and ecological processes respond
over temporal and spatial scales under both natural and
experimental conditions. Results from long-term studies
investigating changes in vegetation structure are some-
times viewed as ‘‘truth’’ without questioning whether the
methodology accounted for unintended effects of sam-
pling design, technique, observer, time of year, and other
variables such as year-to-year climate variation (Burt
1994; Scott & Hallam 2002; Carlsson et al. 2005). Numer-
ous studies have quantiﬁed how different vegetation sam-
pling techniques can inﬂuence vegetation composition and
abundance data and the detection of vegetation change
over time in various ecosystems (Floyd & Anderson 1987;
Bra¨kenhielm & Qinghong 1994; Stohlgren et al. 1995;
Korb et al. 2003; Abella & Covington 2004). These studies
illustrate that there is no single optimal sampling tech-
nique for all vegetation communities. Rather, speciﬁc
sampling techniques have higher accuracy (how well the
methods describe ‘‘reality’’) and precision (the repeatabil-
ity of the method) over other sampling techniques based
on the plant structure of the vegetation community type
(i.e., forest vs. grassland) (Carlsson et al. 2005). In addi-
tion, studies have quantiﬁed observer effects ﬁnding that
more experienced observers and vegetation sampling
techniques that required low personal judgment (e.g., fre-
quency plots) had higher accuracy and precision (Gotfryd
& Hansell 1985; Kennedy & Addison 1987; Tonteri 1990).
Few researchers have investigated intraannual (within
one growing season) vegetation change to determine if
there is an optimal time for vegetation sampling to quan-
tify community species richness and abundance and if
these variables remain constant across the growing season
(Kennedy & Addison 1987; Carlsson et al. 2005). Carlsson
et al. (2005) sampled intraannual vegetation change in
a seminatural grassland and found no signiﬁcant differen-
ces in species frequency and only slight differences in spe-
cies cover due to vegetation growth. Generally, vegetation
sampling occurs within the growing season with little
regard to repeating measurements within a similar calen-
dar or phenological time frame between years (interan-
nual vegetation change). Sampling permanent vegetation
plots across a short period of time provides insight into
the repeatability (precision) of the sampling technique,
similar to quantifying the effect of observer on vegetation
community data (Gotfryd & Hansell 1985).
Assessing vegetation change is important in the context
of ecological restoration where treatments are applied

composition, structure, and function. We examined per-
manent plot data from a restoration experiment in a warm,
dry mixed conifer forest of southwestern Colorado. The
experiment was designed to quantify the effects of two
treatments: (1) restoration thinning and prescribed burning
and (2) prescribed burning only, on tree and subcanopy
vegetation. In this forest type, there has been a shift in spe-
cies composition and abundance to shade-tolerant species
such as White ﬁr (Abies concolor (Gord. & Glend.) Lindl.
ex Hildebr.) and Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mir-
bel) Franco) at the expense of the shade-intolerant but
more
ﬁre-resistant
Ponderosa
pine
(Pinus
ponderosa
Dougl. Ex Laws.) (Romme et al. 2003, unpublished data).
Increased vertical and horizontal fuel continuity has also
developed (Heinlein et al. 2005). Within our study region,
this shift in forest structure has been attributed to the cur-
rent ﬁre-free period (1881–present) being longer than the
pre-European pattern (mean ﬁre interval was 14.7–17.1
years over the period 1616–1880 [Wu 1999]).
Within the forest restoration experimental design, the
goal of the present study was to assess the effects of mea-
surement
date
on
perceived
vegetation
changes
in
untreated controls. We hypothesized that there would be
signiﬁcant species richness and abundance differences in
intraannual vegetation due to the combination of individual
species’
phenologies
and
summer
monsoonal
(July–
August) thunderstorms. As a result, we also hypothesized
that the cumulative effect of individual species’ phenologies
would result in signiﬁcant interannual vegetation differen-
ces among different sampling time frames (June, July, and
August). The speciﬁc objectives of this study were to com-
pare (1) intraannual vegetation change across one growing
season (2005) by measuring vegetation three times at
1-month intervals (June, July, August) and (2) interannual
vegetation change between two time periods (2003 and
2005) to determine if the sampling time frame inﬂuences
vegetation results. The latter objective is particularly
important in experimental design studies where the con-
trols are established as a reference to quantify changes in
experimental units. If signiﬁcant changes are found in the
controls, then there is lower statistical power to infer that
changes in the experimental units are due to treatments.
Methods
Study Area
The study area is located on lower Middle Mountain,
approximately 18 km northwest of Pagosa Springs, in
southwest Colorado. Lower Middle Mountain encom-
passes roughly 370 ha in Archuleta County, Colorado
(T35N, R3W, Sections 16, 17, 18, and 20, N.M.P.M). Our
study area is approximately 159 ha or 49% of lower Mid-
dle Mountain. Lower Middle Mountain is part of the Pie-
dra Roadless Area. Currently, there are no open roads,
but there are approximately 8 km of closed, interior roads
constructed in the late 1980s to access a timber sale.
Lower Middle Mountain consists of moderately steep
mountain slopes and benches. Elevations range from 2,438
to 2,743 m, with slopes in the 15–30% range on a generally
south-facing aspect. The dominant soil type is Dutton loam,
from silty clay loam parent material (USDA Forest Service
2004). Average daily temperatures range from a maximum
of 27C in July to a minimum of 214.3C in January. Aver-
age annual precipitation is 67.3 cm and is distributed
throughout the year with the greatest amounts occurring in
July and August due to summer monsoonal thunderstorm
activity. Precipitation totals during the growing season
(May–August) for 2003 and 2005 were both slightly below
the 57-year average and were within 1 standard deviation
of 1948–2005 averages (Western Regional Climate Center
2006 [www.wrcc.dri.edu]).
Vegetation consists primarily of the warm, dry mixed
conifer forest type. This forest type is dominated by Pon-
derosa pine, White ﬁr, and Douglas-ﬁr. Small pockets of
both mature and young Aspen (Populus tremuloides
Michx.) are also found throughout the study area. The
midstory and understory are dominated primarily by
White ﬁr and Douglas-ﬁr, with a variety of shrubs includ-
ing Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.), Snowberry
(Symphoricarpus rotundifolius Gray), and Serviceberry
(Amelanchier alnifolia (Nutt.) Nutt. ex M. Roemer).
Occasional Ponderosa pine regeneration is present. Com-
mon herbaceous species at the site include Blue wild rye
(Elymus glaucus Buckley), Thurber’s fescue (Festuca thur-
beri Vasey), Parry’s oatgrass (Danthonia parryi Scribn.),
Muttongrass (Poa fendleriana (Steud.) Vasey), Little sun-
ﬂower (Helianthella quinquenervis (Hooker) Gray), Tuber
starwort (Pseudostellaria jamesiana (Torrey) Weber and
Hartman), and Showy ﬂeabane (Erigeron speciosus (Lind-
ley) de Candolle).
Field Methods
Lower Middle Mountain was divided into four blocks.
Within
each
block,
there
are
3
experimental
units
(approximately 16 ha/each) for a total of 12 units. Forest
restoration treatments were randomly assigned to each of
three units per block (control, thinning and prescribed
burning, and prescribed burning only). Within each
approximately 16-ha unit, 20 permanent monitoring plots
were established on a 60-m grid in all four cardinal direc-
tions based on a systematic starting grid point (total N ¼ 4
blocks 3 3 treatment units/block 3 20 plots/unit ¼ 240
plots). All plot centers were permanently marked with
iron stakes and were georeferenced with Global Position-
ing Systems. For this study, eight randomly selected plots
from each control unit were sampled for a total of 32 plots
(4 control units 3 8 plots). Sampling occurred in the exact
same plots over a 4.5-week period (July 10 to August 14)
in 2003 and within a 2-week period in June (3–15), July
(5–17), and August (2–14) 2005. Comparisons between
different sampling years (interannual change) were com-
pared with July and August 2005 data to see if the

sampling time frame during the growing season inﬂuenced
results.
We used a modiﬁcation of the Modiﬁed-Whittaker sam-
pling design (Stohlgren et al. 1995) to measure understory
vegetation. One of the main objectives of this sampling
design is to quantify plant foliar cover for most species in
the area and to provide cover data that have low spatial
autocorrelation (Stohlgren et al. 1995). We established at
each plot center a 50-m line transect along the topo-
graphic (slope) gradient with 25 m below center and 25 m
above center. A 10 3 50–m belt transect was centered
over each 50-m line transect. All herbaceous and shrub
species within the belt were recorded. We did not record
any plant cover or substrate data for the belt transects.
Four 1-m2 (0.5 3 2 m) subplots were established within
the belt transect at 14-m intervals with the 2-m side paral-
lel to the transect. The 1-m2 subplots were located in the
top left and bottom right corners of the belt transect and
on the right side of the line transect at 16 m and the left
side of the line transect at 32 m. For each subplot, we esti-
mated the percent cover of each species to the nearest
quarter percent using cardboard cutouts of known sizes as
visual guides (Tilman 1997). Ocular estimation of plant
cover is a commonly used method for determining plant
dominance, succession, and treatment response in vegeta-
tion analysis (Hatton et al. 1986). The estimates can total
greater than 100% because percent cover was estimated
independently for each species and independent of canopy
position, meaning that plants could overlap each other.
Individual species abundance was calculated by averaging
the species abundance in the four subplots/transect. The
percent cover of litter, rock, wood, and bare mineral soil
was also estimated for each subplot. Ten botanists work-
ing in pairs of two sampled all 240 understory plots in
2003. Two individuals working together conducted all the
2005 sampling to eliminate observer differences between
the three sampling periods; these two individuals were
one of the botanist pairs that surveyed in 2003.
Statistical Analyses
Total plant richness and abundance, abundances for indi-
vidual species and groups (growth form, duration, and ori-
gin), and species diversity (Simpson’s D and Shannon’s H)
were calculated by averaging the four 1-m2 subplots for
each plot. The Shannon–Weiner’s diversity index deter-
mines the average uncertainty of predicting the species of
an individual randomly chosen from the community. As
species richness and evenness increase within the commu-
nity, the diversity index increases as well. The Simpson
index is based on similar principles.
Multivariate analysis of variance repeated measures
was used to determine the effect of different sampling
periods on univariate herbaceous species richness and
abundance data collected in 2003 and 2005. We used the
Shapiro–Wilks test to determine whether data met the
normality assumption and Levene’s test to determine if
data met the homogeneity of variance assumption (Milli-
ken & Johnson 1984). The Greenhouse and Geisser cor-
rection for sphericity was used to determine signiﬁcant
differences at p  0.05. We made multiple comparisons of
means between different sampling time frames using
paired t tests followed by a Bonferroni adjustment
(Howell 2002). We took the original alpha value (0.05)
and divided by the number of paired comparisons (3) to
determine our new alpha value (0.167). These analyses
were conducted using the JMP-IN statistical package
(SAS Institute, Inc. 2004).
We used indicator species analysis (Dufreˆne & Legen-
dre 1997) to identify species that were particularly faithful
to a speciﬁc sampling period. Indicator species analysis
was calculated using PC-ORD software (McCune &
Mefford 1999). A comparison between the maximum indi-
cator value (0–100) and random trials for the occurrence
of a given species (1,000 Monte Carlo randomizations)
provides a p value (McCune & Grace 2002). Species with
a p value 0.05 were accepted as indicator species for
a particular sampling period.
Results
We detected a total of 182 species in the study area. Forbs
represented the majority of plant richness with 67.8%,
graminoids with 18.2%, and shrubs with 14%. Ninety-
seven percent of the species were perennials and only 3%
were annuals or biennials on average. Native species were
signiﬁcantly more abundant (95.1%), with only 4.9%
being of non-native origin. The most abundant non-native
species included Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.),
Dandelion (Taraxacum ofﬁcinale G.H. Weber ex Wig-
gers), Timothy grass (Phleum pretense L.), and False sal-
isfy (Tragapogon pratensis L.). The only listed Colorado
noxious weeds were Bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare (Savi)
Tenore) and Canada thistle (Breea arvense (L.) Lessing).
Intraannual Change
There were no signiﬁcant differences among total herba-
ceous and shrub abundance across the three 1-month
interval sampling periods during the 2005 growing season
(F ¼ 3.47; p ¼ 0.157), although the July sampling period
was approximately 15% higher than June or August abun-
dance values (Tables 1 & 2). There were marginally signiﬁ-
cant differences for total species richness over these three
sampling periods during the 2005 growing season (F ¼
9.39; p ¼ 0.0963) and no signiﬁcant differences for diver-
sity indexes (Table 1). Indicator species analysis showed
six indicator species for the June 2005 sampling period
with no indicator species for either July or August 2005
(Table 5). All six of the June indicator species were
spring/early summer forbs. Two of these species were no
longer detectable in either the July or the August sampling
periods (Bitterroot (Lewisia nevadensis (A. Gray) B. L.
Robinson) and an unknown lanceolate single-leaf spring

forb that did not ﬂower in 2003 or 2005). There were no
signiﬁcant differences among the three 1-month interval
sampling periods during 2005 for any forest ﬂoor sub-
strates (litter, rock, wood, or bare mineral soil).
Interannual Change
Total herbaceous and shrub abundance was signiﬁcantly
higher (F ¼ 98.58; p ¼ 0.0022) during the July 2005 sam-
pling period (34.3%) than in 2003 (25.08%) (Table1). Spe-
ciﬁcally, forb (F ¼ 10.54; p ¼ 0.048) and shrub (F ¼ 25.06;
p ¼ 0.015) abundances were higher in the July 2005 sam-
pling period than in 2003 (Table2). There were no signiﬁ-
cant differences in graminoid cover between these two
sampling periods. Perennial abundance was signiﬁcantly
higher in July 2005 than in 2003 (F ¼ 47.43; p ¼ 0.009), with
no signiﬁcant differences between annual and biennial
abundance for the two sampling periods (Table2). Native
species abundance was also signiﬁcantly higher in July
2005 than in 2003 (F ¼ 89.54; p ¼ 0.0034), with no signif-
icant differences for non-native abundance (Table 2).
There were no signiﬁcant differences in total species
richness or Simpson’s or Shannon’s diversity indices
between 2003 and July 2005 (Table 1). Similarly, there
were no signiﬁcant differences in species richness by
growth form, duration, or origin (Table 2) between the
two sampling periods.
Indicator species analysis showed that the difference
between these two sampling periods was primarily driven
by six forb species having higher cover values in July 2005
than in 2003 and one graminoid, Thurber’s fescue, having
higher cover in 2003 than in July 2005 (Table 3). There
were signiﬁcant differences between the 2003 and the July
2005 sampling periods for the litter substrate (F ¼ 24.03;
p ¼ 0.031); all other forest ﬂoor substrates were similar
between the two sampling periods.
Total herbaceous and shrub abundance was not signiﬁ-
cantly different (F ¼ 6.77; p ¼ .08) between 2003 and

cies analysis showed two species being faithful to the 2003

between the 2003 and the August 2005 sampling periods
for any forest ﬂoor substrates (litter, rock, wood, or bare
mineral soil).
Discussion
We detected patterns over the three sampling periods
within one growing season (June–August 2005). Spring/
early summer species were associated more with the June
sampling period as indicated through indicator species
analysis. These species were in higher abundance during
the June sampling period, yet often withered completely
by the August sampling period and therefore were not
detected. Forb cover was approximately 2% higher during
the July sampling period than in June or August, indicat-
ing that forbs in the warm, dry mixed conifer tend to peak
in abundance in early July. This pattern was evident
visually by the observers (J. E. Korb, Fort Lewis College,
personal observation, 2005) with numerous species signiﬁ-
cantly decreasing between the July and the August sam-
pling periods, e.g., Northern bedstraw (Galium borale L.),
Peavine, and Tuber starwort). Forbs in the Asteraceae
family peaked in abundance during the August sampling
period, which is common for this family in the Southwest
(Weber & Whittmann 2001). Graminoid cover was
approximately 1% higher in July and August in compari-
son to June sampling. This pattern is congruent with
graminoid abundance patterns in other vegetation com-
munities (Nigel & Poulton 1998).
Sampling in 2003 occurred over a 4.5-week period (July
10 to August 14). As a result, we were interested in testing
to see if there was a difference between sampling years
(2003 and 2005) with either the July or the August 2005
data. Our results showed signiﬁcant differences between
the 2003 and the July 2005 data and no signiﬁcant differ-
ences between the 2003 and the August 2005 data. These
ﬁndings are important because they illustrate that the
sampling period, even within a few weeks, inﬂuenced
understory vegetation community data and therefore their
interpretation. When we compared the July 2005 data
with the 2003 data, we found that there was signiﬁcantly
higher overall understory abundance in 2005. There were
no signiﬁcant differences in growing season precipitation
between these 2 years and therefore trying to interpret
these results would be difﬁcult if we would not have col-
lected data across the growing season in 2005. Year-
to-year variation in understory vegetation due to climate
has been found in similar southwestern forest types such
as Ponderosa pine where precipitation is the limiting fac-
tor to plant growth (Korb et al. 2003; Abella & Covington
2004). One possible interpretation would be that year-
to-year observer differences were inﬂuencing results.
Numerous studies have investigated the role of interob-
server variation in vegetation assessments and have found
some level of variation among observers for species identi-
ﬁcation and species cover abundances due to variation in
plot placement and observer expertise (Tonteri 1990;
Scott & Hallam 2002; Ringvall et al. 2005). Some level
of variation is to be expected with repeat sampling where
the same observers are not able to be used year to year;

however, with numerous plot replicates and calibration
among observers for sampling methodology as was done
in this study, observer noise can be minimized. When we
compared the August 2005 data with the 2003 data, we
found no signiﬁcant difference in overall understory abun-
dance, which is desirable because the sampling occurred
in areas with no treatments, during a similar phenological
time frame, and there were no signiﬁcant differences in
growing season precipitation between these 2 years. This
ﬁnding
also
supports
that
interobserver
differences
between the 2003 and the 2005 sampling periods were
minimal. The lack of signiﬁcant differences between her-
baceous and shrub richness and abundance between 2003
and August 2005 indicates that the understory vegetation
sampling design we chose for this long-term monitoring
project is repeatable across time (precision), which is
important in long-term time series data. Precision is more
important in time series data than accuracy because the
sampling methodology needs to be repeatable (Gotfryd &
Hansell 1985). Our ﬁndings are congruent with other stud-
ies that have shown visual estimation to have higher preci-
sion over other sampling methodologies (Bra¨kenhielm &
Qinghong 1994; Korb et al. 2003; Abella & Covington
2004) supporting the use of visual estimates for long-term
vegetation studies. We recommend that posttreatment
herbaceous and shrub understory sampling for this long-
term study should occur within a similar phenological time
frame (approximately the end of July to early August) to
eliminate the possibility that sampling timing will inﬂu-
ence results. Sampling timing should be identiﬁed based
on a similar phenological time frame rather than a speciﬁc
calendar date due to year-to-year variation in precipita-
tion and temperature that is commonly found in semiarid
environments.
Conclusion and Recommendations
The results from this study indicate that there is no opti-
mal sampling time frame for the herbaceous and shrub
understory in the warm, dry mixed conifer. Speciﬁcally,
different species will have higher abundances at various
times during the growing season due to individual species’
phenologies. However, regardless of what sampling time
frame is chosen for a particular study, we recommend
sampling be conducted within a similar phenological time
frame each year or signiﬁcant differences may be detected
that are not due to treatment effects or large variations in
year-to-year climate but simply changes in the sampling
time frame among years. This ﬁnding has implications for
long-term research studies where the objectives are to
detect changes over time in response to treatments, cli-
mate variation, and natural processes such as vegetation
successional changes. We recommend that monitors should
not arbitrarily determine when to sample understory herba-
ceous and shrub vegetation. A speciﬁc sampling time frame
should be chosen based on the following criteria: (1) the
sampling period is congruent with research objectives such
as detecting richness and abundance and (2) the sampling
period is feasible in regard to personnel and ﬁnancial con-
straints. By sampling within a similar phenological time
frame each year, the possibility that changes over time in
long-term understory vegetation studies are due to varia-
tions in the sampling time frame rather than the questions
being investigated can be minimized.
Implications for Practice
d There is no optimal sampling time frame for the her-
baceous and shrub understory for any vegetation
type.
d Long-term, repeat sampling should occur within
a similar phenological time frame each year over
a short amount of time.
d The determination of the sampling time frame needs
to be congruent with individual research objectives,
such as detecting rare species or peak understory
abundance, and sampling feasibility in regard to per-
sonnel and ﬁnancial constraints.
