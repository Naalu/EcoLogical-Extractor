ABSTRACT 
EVIDENCE-BASED REVIEW OF SEEDING IN POST-FIRE REHABILITATION 
AND NATIVE PLANT MARKET FEASIBILITY 
DONNA L. PEPPIN 
 
A changing climate and fire regime shifts in the western United States have led to 
an increase in revegetation activities, in particular post-wildfire rehabilitation and the 
need for locally-adapted plant materials.  Broadcast seeding is one of the most widely 
used post-wildfire emergency response treatments to minimize soil erosion, promote 
plant community recovery, and reduce non-native species invasions.  However, these 
treatments can have negative ecological effects, due in part to the continued use of non-native 
species, although the use of native species has increased.   
We undertook an evidence-based systematic review to examine post-fire seeding 
treatments´ effectiveness and effects on soils and plant communities in forests of the 
western U.S.  Out of the 27 studies providing evidence regarding post-fire seeding effects 
on soil erosion, 33% of the studies showed seeding to be effective, an equal percentage of 
studies (26% each) showed minimal effectiveness or ineffectiveness, and 15% showed no 
difference in effectiveness of seeding in minimizing soil erosion. However, based on 
quality of evidence criteria, only one of 12 studies reported in the two highest quality 
categories qualified seeding effectiveness for soil erosion.  Seventy-eight percent of study 
sites in publications evaluating soil erosion showed that seeding provides no additional 
benefit in reducing erosion relative to unseeded controls.  Studies consistently showed 
that seeding reduced native species cover (62%) and/or suppressed recovery of native 
plants (60%), although long-term data on these effects are limited.  Seeding was effective 

3 
 
in reducing non-native species invasions 54% of the time; however, of those treatments, 
83% introduced additional negative impacts on native communities by seeding with non-
native species.  Post-fire seeding is costly and the scientific literature and management 
documentation show that it does little to protect soil and promote plant recovery in the 
short-term and may introduce potentially negative effects with long-term ecological 
consequences.   
 
Through a literature search, interviews and site visits, we identified existing 
native plant markets to use as models to assess the feasibility of a native plant market in 
the southern Colorado Plateau.  We used web-based surveys to identify critical native 
plant material needs and concerns.  Survey results indicate that management policy 
strongly drives decisions regarding the use and purchase of native plant materials.  From 
a demand perspective, lack of availability and high cost of native plant materials has kept 
purchasing minimal, despite policy changes favoring the use of natives.  For suppliers, 
further development of native plant materials is limited by inconsistent and unreliable 
demand and lack of production knowledge.  The knowledge and tools necessary to 
initiate a native plant materials market are available.  However, communication among 
producers, land managers, buyers, and researchers, as well as partnerships with local 
growers, appear to be vital to initiating a functional market.

CHAPTER ONE 
Introduction 
Over the past century, land use and management practices in conjunction with 
changing climate conditions have led to alteration of native ecosystems and fire regime 
shifts in the western United States (Covington and Moore 1994; Belsky and Blumenthal 
2002; Westerling et al. 2006).  In recent decades, areas of high-severity forest fires have 
increased by as much as an order of magnitude in the western United States (Westerling 
et al. 2006).  Climate projections consistently indicate that trends of altered precipitation 
patterns and increasing size and severity of wildfires will continue (McKenzie et al. 2004; 
Westerling et al. 2006; Seager et al. 2007).  A changing climate and fire regime shifts 
may have direct effects on local plant community composition and structure (Hanson and 
Weltzin 2000; Wang and Kemball 2005; Hunter and Omi 2006) and fire relations within 
communities (Ryan 1991; Bachelet et al. 2001).  In light of these concerns, interest in 
restoring these disturbed lands has become more widespread (Allen et al. 2002; McKay et 
al. 2005).  
Post-fire emergency rehabilitation efforts have increased in the western United 
States in response to the growth in severe wildfires (Robichaud et al. 2000).  According 
to recent reviews (Robichaud et al. 2000; Beyers 2004), broadcast seeding is one of the 
most widely use and cost-effective post-fire emergency response treatments to minimize 
soil erosion, promote plant community recovery, and reduce non-native species invasions 
in forested ecosystems throughout the West (Richards et al. 1998; Robichaud et al. 2000; 
Beyers 2004).  Previous post-fire seeding research has indicated that seeding treatments 
often do not result in high vegetative cover and can negatively impact native plant 

11 
 
communities (Robichaud et al. 2000; Beyers 2004) by competing with recovering native 
species (Schoennagel and Waller 1999; Barclay 2004; Keeley 2004; Kruse et al. 2004), 
persistence of seeded non-native species (Sexton 1998; Barclay et al. 2004; Hunter et al. 
2006), introducing non-natives (Sexton 1998; Hunter et al. 2006) and changing fine fuels 
which may further alter fire regimes (Schoennagel and Waller 1999; Keeley 2004).  
Thus, seeding may impose long-term ecological changes to ecosystem composition and 
structure (Beschta et al. 2004).  
Since the reviews  by Robichaud et al. (2000) and Beyers (2004), several 
important developments have altered the context of post-fire seeding: 1) increasing size 
and severity of wildfires across the West (McKenzie et al. 2004; Westerling et al. 2006); 
2) increased use and allocation of funds for native seed mixes (Wolfson and Sieg, in 
press); 3) increased research on post-fire seeding and plant community interactions; and 
4) stronger policy direction for the use of genetically appropriate seed sources (seed 
sources adapted to local site conditions and genetically compatible with existing plant 
populations) and quantitative monitoring (GAO 2003; USDA 2006).  In Chapter 2, I 
present a systematic evidence-based review of the scientific literature, theses, and burned 
area rehabilitation monitoring reports to provide an up-to-date synthesis of knowledge 
about post-fire seeding in forested ecosystems across the western U.S. and its effects and 
effectiveness on soils and native plant communities. 
 
In recent years, major wildfires such as the 2000 Cerro Grande and the 2002 
Rodeo-Chediski have become primary drivers of revegetation activities, and more 
specifically, post-fire seeding efforts in the Southwest (Friederici 2003).  Revegetation 
policies have recently begun to recognize the importance of using genetically-appropriate 

12 
 
materials during restoration and rehabilitation activities (Richards et al. 1998, Erickson 
2008).  However, although national policies for federal land management agencies direct 
the use of locally-adapted plant species as a first choice in revegetation activities, the use 
of non-native species in revegetation projects throughout the region continues. 
Justifications for non-native plant use include the increasing need for post-fire emergency 
rehabilitation as well as the limited availability and high cost of locally-adapted plant 
materials.  
 
New revegetation policies and funding sources have emerged as a result of 
increased recognition from Congress of the need for an abundant supply of native plant 
materials and the establishment of the Federal Interagency Native Plant Materials 
Development Committee in 2000 (USDA and USDI 2002).  Since 2000, interagency 
projects have been developed to meet the need for increased native plant material 
availability and production information (Pellant et al. 2004; Shaw et al. 2005).  
Unfortunately, only minimal native plant production efforts currently exist in the 
Southwest and, due to scarcity locally-adapted plant materials, regional projects 
frequently incorporate genetic materials from distant sources which may have negative 
effects on native plant communities (Lynch 1991; Hufford and Mazer 2003).  In response 
to the need for native plant materials in the Southwest, in Chapter 3 I assess the prospects 
for a native plant market on the southern Colorado Plateau.

CHAPTER TWO 
Does seeding after severe forest fires in the western USA reduce  
negative impacts on soils and plant communities? 
Abstract 
Broadcast seeding is one of the most widely used post-wildfire emergency response 
treatments intended to minimize soil erosion, promote plant community recovery, and 
minimize establishment and spread of non-native plant species.  However, these 
treatments can also have negative effects, including facilitation of weed invasions and 
competition with recovering native plant communities.  We conducted an evidence-based 
review to examine the effectiveness and effects of post-fire seeding treatments on soil 
stabilization and plant community attributes in western U.S. forests.  We reviewed 94 
scientific papers, theses, and agency monitoring reports selected using a systematic 
search protocol.  The majority of studies (78%) evaluating soil erosion in seeded versus 
unseeded controls showed that seeding did not reduce erosion relative to unseeded 
controls.  Even when seeding significantly increased vegetative cover, seeded sites rarely 
supported sufficient plant cover to stabilize soils within the first and second year post-
fire.   A majority of studies reported that seeding reduced native species cover (62%) 
and/or suppressed (60%) recovery of native plants, although long-term data on these 
effects are limited.  According to papers evaluating seeding effectiveness for curtailing 
invasions of non-native plant species, an almost equal percentage found seeding 
treatments to be an effective (54%) or ineffective (45%) measure to reduce non-natives.  
However, 83% of treatments regarded as effective caused additional negative impacts on 
native communities by seeding with non-native species.  The use of native species has 
increased in recent years; yet use of non-native annuals continues.  Some native species 

19 
 
used may not be locally-adapted and genetically-appropriate (seed sources adapted to 
local site conditions and genetically compatible with existing plant populations) for areas 
seeded.  The scientific literature and management documentation suggest that costly post-
fire seeding does little to protect soil and promote plant recovery in the short-term and 
has potentially negative effects with long-term ecological consequences.   
 
Introduction 
Land management agencies in the U.S. such as the Forest Service, National Park 
Service, Bureau of Land Management are required by federal burned area emergency 
rehabilitation policy (USDI and USDA 2006) to prescribe emergency watershed-
rehabilitation measures when and where deemed necessary to: 1) stabilize soil; 2) control 
water, sediment, and debris movement; 3) prevent ecosystem degradation; and 4) 
minimize threats to human life or property.  Historically, aerial broadcast seeding of 
grasses, typically non-native annuals or short-lived perennials, has been the most 
commonly used post-fire rehabilitation treatment (Robichaud et al. 2000; Beyers 2004).  
As an emergency treatment, rapid vegetation establishment has been regarded as the most 
cost-effective method to mitigate the risks of increased runoff and soil erosion, and 
establishment of non-native species (Richards et al. 1998; Robichaud et al. 2000; Beyers 
2004; Wolfson and Sieg, in press).  Federal policy in the U.S. currently mandates use of 
seed from native species for post-fire rehabilitation when available and economically 
feasible (Richards et al. 1998).  Although the use of native species has increased (Beyers 
2004; Wolfson and Sieg, in press), high costs and limited availability often limits 
inclusion of native plants in post-fire seedings.  Furthermore, a vague definition of the 
term “native” has led to broad and inconsistent interpretations regarding the types and 

20 
 
origins of native species used (Richards et al.1998) and concerns over their use.  Despite 
ongoing debates over the efficacy of post-fire seeding and potential negative impacts on 
natural plant community recovery, seeding remains a widely used rehabilitation treatment 
in forested ecosystems throughout the West (Robichaud et al. 2000, Beyer 2004).  
 
Robichaud et al. (2000) published an extensive review summarizing the 
effectiveness of post-fire rehabilitation treatments used by the U.S. Forest Service. 
Among other topics, the review addressed post-fire seeding, a practice Robichaud et al. 
(2000) described as the most widely used post-fire rehabilitation treatment.  Studies 
occurring in chaparral and conifer forests suggested that seeding did not consistently 
assure high plant cover during the critical first year after burning.  In nine seeding studies 
in conifer forests providing quantitative ground cover data from seeded and unseeded 
treatments, about a third of seeding treatments reported less than 30% ground cover and 
less than a fourth of these treatments provided at least 60% ground cover, the percentage 
of ground needed to adequately reduce soil erosion in the first year post-fire (Noble 1965; 
Orr 1970).  A recent review of post-fire seeding effectiveness (Beyers 2004) reported that 
seeding seldom produces effective cover to mitigate erosion; however, in cases where 
post-fire growth of seeded species provides adequate cover to substantially reduce 
erosion (> 60%), seeding can suppress native plant community recovery including shrub 
and tree seedlings. Both reviews recognized the importance of quantified monitoring to 
properly evaluate the effectiveness and impacts of post-fire seeding.  
 
Since publication of Robichaud et al. (2000) and Beyers (2004), several 
developments have altered the context of post-fire seeding, including increasing size and 
severity of wildfires across the West (McKenzie et al. 2004; Westerling et al. 2006), 

21 
 
increased use and allocation of funds for native seed mixes (Wolfson and Sieg, in press), 
increased research and quantitative monitoring on post-fire seeding and plant community 
interactions, and stronger policy direction for the use of locally-adapted and genetically 
appropriate seed sources (seed sources adapted to local site conditions and genetically 
compatible with existing plant populations) (GAO 2003; Rogers and Montalvo 2004; 
USDA 2006).  
 
We conducted an evidence-based systematic review of the scientific literature, 
theses, and burned area rehabilitation monitoring reports to provide an up-to-date 
synthesis of knowledge about post-fire seeding in forested ecosystems across the western 
U.S.  We addressed three questions pertaining to post-fire seeding relative to overall 
treatment effectiveness and effects on soils and plant communities: 1) Does seeding after 
severe forest fires reduce soil erosion? 2) Does seeding after severe forest fires reduce 
negative impacts on plant communities? and 3) Does seeding curtail and/or introduce 
non-native species?  
 
Methods 
The systematic review methodology is relatively new in natural resource 
disciplines but has been widely used in medical sciences (Fazey et al. 2005, Pullin and 
Stewart 2006).  This methodology follows a rigorous, predetermined protocol to ensure 
that the synthesis of available literature is thorough, unbiased, and evidence-based.   We 
conducted a formal systematic review using guidelines established by Pullin and Stewart 
(2006).  The guideline stages were: 1) question formulation; 2) protocol formation and 

22 
 
search strategy; 3) data extraction; and 4) analysis.  A team of five members planned and 
conducted the review.   
 
For this review, we defined forested ecosystems as those dominated by tall-stature 
coniferous and/or deciduous trees occurring at elevations above grasslands, pinyon-
juniper woodlands, or chaparral vegetation in the western U.S.  The review team 
developed primary and secondary study questions, which were further refined by 
managers, scientists, and outside experts.  
We developed a review protocol which guided decisions regarding sources of 
information included in the synthesis.  Key decisions included: 1) search, inclusion, and 
rejection criteria; 2) extracting evidence; and 3) comparing evidence.  Managers and 
scientists in the field reviewed the protocol.  Additionally, we submitted our review to 
The Centre for Evidence-Based Conservation (http:\\www. cebc.banor.ac.us/index.htm), 
an international organization that hosts systematic review protocols online and facilitates 
review by a worldwide audience. 
 
We searched online databases (JSTOR, Google Scholar, Forest Science Database, 
Ingenta, Web of Science, AGRICOLA), online government collections, and electronic 
university libraries using combinations of key search terms: seeding AND fire, seeding 
AND burn, seeding AND wildfire, seeding AND erosion, and seeding AND native 
species.  Referred journal articles, peer-reviewed reports (such as government documents 
and conference proceedings), theses, and unpublished literature were considered during 
our search.  Potential studies were then evaluated for inclusion using specific criteria 
based on the subject, treatment, and outcome of the study.  

23 
 
 Subject(s) studied – Seeding studies conducted in forests burnt by wildfire in 
the U.S., predominately coniferous forests of the West since 1970. 
Experimental seeding studies in controlled burns, such as prescribed fires, 
were also included if the information was deemed relevant to post-fire 
seeding. Non-wildfire seeding data were summarized separately from wildfire 
data. 
 Treatment(s) – Seeding herbaceous plant or shrub seed alone or in 
combination with other post-fire rehabilitation activities such as mulching, 
fertilizing, water-bars, and log erosion barriers.  
 Outcome(s) – Change in plant community attributes such as cover, richness 
diversity, biomass, and composition of native and non-native herbaceous 
plants and shrubs, and soil stabilization attributes (runoff, surface erosion, 
sediment yield).   
All potentially relevant publications were imported into a database.  Those 
publications listed as “possibly relevant” were examined by the review coordinator for 
final inclusion decisions.  Duplicate references were discarded from the database.  The 
total number of articles found in the search, those rejected under the inclusion criteria, 
and those ultimately used in the review are shown in Table 1.   
Qualitative data extracted from the reviewed papers included study design, land 
and fire attributes, types of treatments, study results, and conclusions.  We characterized 
the types of plant species seeded as non-native or native, in most cases following the 
author’s classifications from the paper.  When available, information about the origin of 
seed sources used is presented.  However, lack of a widely accepted definition of “native” 

24 
 
(Jones 2003) may cause definitions to differ between papers.  Quantitative data included 
all relevant variables related to soil and/or plant community attributes.  In some instances, 
authors reported results from the same fire in different papers.  In these cases, data from 
each paper were extracted independently but the overlap in studies was noted.  
For consistency, each paper was reviewed by two members of the review panel.  
Reviewers did not evaluate papers they authored.  After all publications were reviewed 
twice we formed a master list of all publications and reviews; this list was then reviewed 
by the review coordinator to locate any inconsistencies in recorded data which were 
discussed with panel members and resolved through consultation with the review 
coordinator.   
We developed criteria to evaluate the the strength of evidence in each study based 
on design and statistical robustness (Table 2).  We judged post-fire seeding effectiveness 
based on the treatment’s ability to mitigate negative impacts in three categories: 1) 
erosion control; 2) plant communities; and 3) non-native species (Table 3); then we 
evaluated post-fire seeding treatment effectiveness in relation to these impact categories 
(Table 4).   When available, quantitative data from seeded and unseeded treatments were 
compared.  Some studies had multiple sites; we made comparisons based on the number 
of sites instead of the total number of publications.  We used descriptive statistics and 
correlation/regression to explore relationships between post-fire seeding treatments and 
associated variables as well as the influence of time since fire.  Regression analysis was 
completed using an alpha level of .05.   
 
Erosion control is strongly related to the amount of cover (Robichaud et al. 2006; 
Rough 2007), so we used increased plant cover (hereafter “success”) as an indicator of 

25 
 
potential erosion control effectiveness (Dadkhah and Gifford 1980; Bruggink 2007).  We 
assessed seeding “success” in the first and second year after fire from studies comparing 
seeded treatments to unseeded plots.  Following the example of Robichaud et al. (2000), 
we used two levels of cover in assessing seeding effectiveness in reducing erosion 
potential: > 30% and > 60%.  We divided relevant papers into ecoregions (Bailey 1983) 
for further analysis of climatic influences.  
For each review question, we drew conclusions (when possible) based on data 
from 1970 to 1999 (papers previously reviewed by Robichaud et al. 2000), and since 
2000.  The latter date was chosen to follow the most comprehensive previous review of 
post-fire seeding (Robichaud et al. 2000).      
 
Results and Discussion 
Considering the entire dataset (n = 94, Appendix I), the largest category of papers 
reviewed was replicated and randomized experiments (19%, Fig. 1).  In the most recent 
period, 2000-2009 (n = 57), there was an increase in replicated randomized experiments 
(46%), review papers (29%), and expert opinions (27%).  Using quality of evidence 
criteria, during the time period between 1970 and 1999 (n = 37), 6 papers (16%) were of 
highest quality, 5 papers (14%) were of high quality, 4 papers (11%) were of medium 
quality, and the majority (22 papers, 60%) were in the low and lowest quality category 
(Fig. 2).  From 2000 to 2009 the number of papers in these categories changed slightly 
with the greatest increase in the high quality of evidence category (16 papers, 28%); 11 
papers (19%) were of highest quality, 6 papers (11%) were of medium quality; 5 papers 

26 
 
(9%) were of low quality, and one-third fell into the lowest quality category (19 papers, 
33%). 
In the overall set of papers, a majority of information on seeding comes from well 
designed experimential studies.  However, in recent years since the publication of 
reviews by Robichaud et al. (2000) and Beyers (2004), there has been greater emphasis 
on study designs of quantitative experimental nature (Fig. 3).   
 
Does seeding after severe forest fires in western USA reduce soil erosion? 
 
Of the entire data set, 27 studies provided evidence regarding post-fire seeding 
effects on soil erosion.  Authors defined erosion control in terms of decreased sediment 
yield, runoff, or surface erosion.  Using effectiveness ratings described in Table 4, 33% 
of studies showed seeding, with non-native and/or native species, to be effective, an equal 
percentage (26%) showed minimal effectiveness or complete ineffectiveness (26%), and 
15% showed no difference in effectiveness of seeding in reducing erosion.  However, the 
evidence for seeding effectiveness dropped substantially when the quality of evidence 
criteria was considered: two of the four studies with highest quality evidence found 
seeding to be ineffective in reducing soil erosion while the other two found no difference 
in effectiveness when compared to unseeded control plots.  For example, Robichaud et al. 
(2006), in a study conducted in north-central Washington, used a randomized block 
design of four plots (each plot with a different experimental treatment) with control 
treatments, replicated eight times to compare the effects of seeding with winter wheat 
(Triticum aestivum) and fertilizing on post-fire erosion rates.  They found no reduction in 
erosion rates for seeding or fertilization treatments, alone, or in combination at any time 

27 
 
during the four-year study.  Five of the eight studies with high quality evidence found 
seeding to be ineffective while two of the other three studies reported minimal 
effectiveness.  The remaining study in the high quality evidence category reported that 
seeding (seeded species unknown) was effective for erosion only in combination with 
mulching and log erosion barriers on a fire in southwestern Colorado (DeWolfe et al. 
2008).  Using the two highest quality categories, only one of 12 studies reported qualified 
seeding effectiveness for soil erosion.  Support for seeding effectiveness was apparent 
only in studies with lower quality evidence.  Only one of the three studies having medium 
quality, three of the four studies having low quality evidence, and all of the eight studies 
with lowest quality evidence found seeding to be effective or minimally effective in 
reducing erosion.  In one publication having lowest quality evidence, two study areas 
(non-random, unreplicated, and uncontrolled) were set up within a single burned area in 
the Black Hills, South Dakota, each with eight plots to assess sedimentation and runoff.   
This study revealed that a mixture of seeded non-native and legume species dominated 
the cover at both sites throughout the study and further postulated that neither site would 
have reached a 60% ground-cover requirement for minimum soil stability within four 
years without seeding (Orr 1970). 
 
As sampling designs have become more rigorous in recent years, evidence that 
seeding is ineffective in reducing erosion has strengthened.  Papers published since 2000 
(16 total) conclude that seeding is ineffective or has no difference in effectiveness 
compared to control treatments in reducing soil erosion (50% each), whereas 27% of 
papers published before 2000 (11 total) suggest seeding as ineffective and 9% having no 

28 
 
difference in effectiveness compared to controls.  Only 9% of earlier papers met the 
criterion of highest or high quality, whereas 71% of papers since 2000 met this criterion.   
 
Post-fire sediment yields in forested ecosystems in the West are most closely 
associated with the amount of surface erosion and rainfall erosivity (MacDonald and 
Larsen, in press), so studies providing erosion data (n = 9) used direct measures of 
sediment yield in seeded versus unseeded sites to assess post-fire seeding effectiveness.  
Seeded sites produced less sediment more often than did unseeded sites (Fig. 4).  
However, 78% found no statistically significant decrease in erosion relative to unseeded 
sites.  The nonsignificant trend toward sediment yield reduction in the first year 
decreased in measurements in the second year and even more so into the third, fourth, 
and fifth year post-fire.  This indicates that seeding had no additional benefit in reducing 
erosion relative to unseeded sites within any study period.   
 
Comparing cover measurements between seeded and unseeded plots across 20 
studies containing a total of 29 study sites, forty-one percent (12 sites) of study sites 
found that seeding significantly increased total plant cover by the end of the first year 
after fire (Table 5).  Fifty-five percent (16 sites) of the seeded sites had greater than 30% 
total plant cover in the first year after fire, compared to only 31% (9 sites) of the 
unseeded sites.  Fourteen percent (4 sites) of seeded sites had more than 60% total plant 
cover after the first year post-fire, compared to none of the unseeded sites.  As 60% total 
plant cover is typically regarded as the threshold to reduce soil erosion following fire 
events (Noble 1965; Orr 1970), we infer that about one-seventh of the seeded sites 
supported sufficient cover to effectively prevent soil erosion in the first year after fire.  
None of the unseeded sites met the 60% plant cover target.  Of the 12 sites were erosion 

29 
 
was measured, none showed that seeding significantly reduced erosion in the first year 
after fire.   
 
In the second year after fire, seeded sites were nearly four times more likely to 
stabilize hillslopes than untreated sites based on cover percentage.  Second-year seeded 
sites had greater total cover than did unseeded sites 39 percent of the time.  Eighty-three 
percent (15 sites) of the seeded sites had greater than 30% cover, compared to 50% (9 
sites) of unseeded sites.  Twenty-eight percent (5 sites) of seeded sites had adequate 
cover to reduce soil erosion to negligible amounts, compared to only 6% (1 site) of 
unseeded sites.  Yet, only one of the studies measuring erosion in the second year showed 
that seeding significantly reduced erosion.  A main focus of post-wildfire rehabilitation 
treatments is on reducing soil erosion in the year immediately following a fire (Kruse et 
al. 2004).  However, seeding appears to have a low probability of effectively reducing 
erosion within the first year and even into the second year.  Furthermore, it appears that 
greater cover does not always produce less erosion (Robichaud et al. 2000). 
 
Authors of all review papers agreed that the studies reviewed lacked any notable 
relationship between establishment of vegetative cover and reduction of erosion within 
the first year after fire (Beschta et al. 2004; Beyers 2004; Wolfson and Sieg, in press). 
This is not surprising as the majority of sediment movement often occurs before plant 
cover is established (Robichaud et al. 2000).  However, our review suggests that seeding 
was more likely to increase plant cover and therefore potentially reduce soil erosion 
Marine and Mediterranean Regime Mountain ecoregions than in Temperate Steppe 
Regime Mountains (Table 5, Fig. 5).   

30 
 
 
In the Intermountain West high intensity short duration rainfall events often occur 
shortly after severe wildfires (Robichaud et al. 2000).  Watersheds within this region are 
therefore prone to high erosivity due to these storm events (Wagenbrenner et al. 2006; 
Kunze et al. 2006; Rough 2007).  Within forests of the Marine and Mediterranean 
Regimes, most annual precipitation occurs during the winter months as snow subsequent 
to mid-late summer wildfires, allowing seeded species to germinate under more ideal 
conditions (Roby 1989; Amaranthus et al. 1993; Robichaud et al. 2006).   
 
Multiple studies provide evidence that seeding for erosion control may be more 
effective when done in concert other treatments (Maloney and Thornton 1995; Meyer et 
al. 2001; Earles et al. 2005; DeWolfe et al. 2008).  Other studies provide evidence 
showing no reduction in erosion rates for either seeding alone or in conjunction with 
these treatments.  Robichaud et al. (2006) studied the effect of seeding with winter wheat 
and fertilizing, alone and in combination, on post-fire erosion rates in north-central 
Washington.  Their results revealed that neither seeding and/or fertilizer treatments 
significantly increased ground cover compared to untreated areas; nor did these 
treatments reduce post-fire erosion rates at any time during the four-year study.  More 
recent studies suggest that mulch treatments alone are more effective than seeding in 
reducing erosion.  For example, in a study conducted in northwestern Montana, Groen 
and Woods (2008) found straw mulch application at a rate of 2.24 Mg/ha resulted in 
100% ground cover and reduced rainsplash erosion by 87% whereas aerial seeding with a 
mixture of native grasses failed to provide enough ground cover to reduce the erosion rate 
relative to untreated areas.  In studies conducted in Colorado’s Front Range, MacDonald 
and Larson (in press) and Wagenbrenner et al. (2006) also found dry mulch to be more 

31 
 
effective than other applied treatments (seeding alone, seeding and mulching, contour-
felled logs, hydromulch, and polyacrylamide) for reducing soil erosion following 
wildfires.  Seeded species in MacDonald and Larson (in press) included native cultivars 
and sterile cereal grains, whereas Wagenbrenner et al. (2006) used a mixture of non-
natives, sterile and non-sterile cereal grains. This evidence suggests that seeding may be 
more effective when used with other erosion control measures, but mulching alone can 
provide as much or more cover then all other treatment combined.   
 
Does seeding after severe forest fires in the western USA reduce negative impacts on 
plant communities?  
Post-fire seeding treatments are often intended to promote recovery of plant 
communities by allowing re-establishment of native plant species over time (USDI and 
USDA 2006).  However, across forested ecosystems, there is evidence that seeded 
species suppress recovery of native graminoids, forbs, and shrub and tree seedlings.  
Effects of seeding on native plant recovery are strongly influenced by what species are 
seeded, post-fire precipitation, and time since fire (Schoennagel and Waller 1999; 
Barclay et al. 2004; Robichaud and Elliot 2006; Wagenbrenner et al. 2006; Peterson et al. 
2007; Rough 2007).   
 
Twenty-six papers specifically addressed post-fire seeding effects on native plant 
cover.  Grouped by effectiveness ratings (Tables 3 and 4), a majority (62%, 16 papers) 
showed seeding, regardless of seeded species type, as ineffective, 19% (5 papers) showed 
seeding to be effective, 8% (2 papers) showed minimal effectiveness, and 12% (3 papers) 
showed no difference in effectiveness in increasing native plant cover compared to 

32 
 
unseeded controls.  When considering quality of evidence criteria, three of the six papers 
(50%) of highest quality evidence showed seeding to be ineffective and one each of the 
remaining papers showed seeding as having no difference in effectiveness, minimal 
effectiveness, or effective in increasing native cover.  Two out of five papers (40%) 
providing high quality evidence showed seeding to be ineffective, while two stated 
seeding as effective, and the remaining study showed minimal effectiveness in increasing 
cover.  Of all studies in the highest and high quality of evidence categories (11 papers), 
almost half (45%, 5 papers) found seeding to be ineffective in increasing native plant 
cover.  Six of the seven papers (86%) providing medium quality evidence agreed that 
seeding was ineffective in increasing native cover, and of the low and lowest quality of 
evidence categories combined, 63% determined seeding to be ineffective.   
 
Of those studies in the highest and high evidence categories finding a reduction of 
native plant cover (5 papers), three indicated that seeding treatments leading to the 
suppression of native plants in the first year could have persistent effects on post-fire 
vegetation recovery.  For example, Stella (2009) found that annual and biennial native 
forbs were significantly reduced as compared to forbs in control treatments as a result of 
seeded annual species on fires in the Southwest and that this reduction persisted into the 
second year even though the cover of seeded species was reduced.  Another southwestern 
U.S. study found a similar effect of seeding annual ryegrass (Lolium perenne ssp. 
multiflorum) on native forbs (Barclay et al. 2004): cover of native forbs in non-seeded 
areas increased from year one to year two, but native forb cover in seeded areas remained 
constant while ryegrass cover declined.  The remaining study, conducted in the eastern 
Cascades, showed a reduction of native early-successional species and fire-dependent 

33 
 
colonizers as a result of high frequency and cover of seeded non-natives.  The researchers 
suggested further that seeding effects could therefore alter native plant communities well 
beyond the life of seeded species (Schoennagel and Waller 1999).   
 
In three out of the four (75%) highest or high quality of evidence studies showing 
no difference or minimal effectiveness in increasing native cover relative to unseeded 
sites, variable precipitation was a major determining factor in the success in seeding 
various mixtures of non-natives, natives, and sterile cereal grains and subsequent impact 
on recovery of native vegetation (Robichaud et al. 2006; Wagenbrenner et al. 2006; 
Peterson et al. 2007).  Only two studies within the highest and high quality of evidence 
categories (Springer et al. 2001; Hunter and Omi 2006) showed that seeding enhanced 
native plant cover.  Hunter and Omi (2006) examined how seeded species (a mixture of 
native cultivars and non-native annual grasses) and native grasses responded to increased 
availability of soil nitrogen and light after the Cerro Grande burn in New Mexico.  They 
found that cover of native species (those not seeded during post-fire rehabilitation efforts) 
increased over a four-year period in seeded areas of low fire severity and did not differ 
between seeded and unseeded areas of high fire severity although seeded grass cover 
remained high.  However, seeding treatments did reduce native species richness, at least 
at small scales (Hunter and Omi 2006).  Springer et al. (2001) seeded with native species 
considered to be “weed free” in areas subjected to a prescribed burn in northwestern 
Arizona; seeded native species therefore may have contributed to an increase in perennial 
native species cover three years after burning.   
 
These results suggest, in part, that both seeded species and native plant cover are 
highly influenced by post-fire precipitation.  When unfavorable conditions (e.g. low 

34 
 
precipitation) occur, seeding often has no effect on native species cover and/or recovery.  
In contrast, under favorable conditions seeded species rapidly dominate the post-fire 
environment, which in turn may lead to low first-year native plant recruitment and 
subsequent reductions in these species over time.  However, a rare long-term studied  
revealed that thirty-one years after  a fire in north-central Washington, non-native 
cultivars which dominated seeded sites initially were completely replaced on seeded sites 
by a diverse mixture of native graminoids, forbs, shrubs and trees (Roche et al. 2008).  
This study suggests that non-native grasses seeded after wildfires do not always have 
persistent effects on native plant communities, but long-term datasets like this one are 
rare so we cannot determine if these findings hold true across studies.   
 
Some studies suggest that seeding treatment performance and effects are related 
to length of time since fire (Robichaud and Elliot 2006; Rough 2007).  Cover data from 
15 studies containing 57 different study sites showed a significant relationship between 
the ratio of seeded cover to control cover versus time since fire (p-value = 0.0447, Fig. 6).  
Although significant, other climatic factors such as precipitation are also important 
controls of cover.  Total cover on seeded plots was more variable but only slightly more 
abundant on average than total cover on control sites for two years post-fire; after two 
years, control cover consistently became more abundant than seeded cover.  However, of 
13 study sites showing greater cover on seeded sites than unseeded controls in the first 
and/or second year post-fire, the majority of the sites (77%, 10 sites) occurred in 
ecoregions characterized by favorable rainfall intensity, amounts, and timing.   In 
addition, in all of these study sites, annual cereal grains or non-native perennial species 
were either seeded alone (62%, 8 sites) or as a predominant proportion of a mix with 

35 
 
natives cultivars and legumes (46%, 6 sites) (Anderson and Brooks 1975; Griffin 1982; 
Amaranthus 1989; Amaranthus et al. 1993; Holzworth 2003; Keeley 2004; Logar 2006; 
Roche et al. 2008).  These results suggest that time since fire plays a major role in natural 
recovery and is an important factor to consider when assessing seeding affects on native 
plant communities.  We can further speculate that seeded species, in particular annual 
cereal grains, may exit the system quickly (after two years) or be outcompeted by native 
or naturalized species after this amount of time.  However, long-term assessment (beyond 
two years) of seeded annual cereal grains is rarely completed, so studies quantifying their 
ability for rapid die-off are limited.  
 
Based on data from above referenced 57 sites, four years after fire, both seeded 
and control sites supported approximately 45% total plant cover, and five years after fire 
both supported 40-41% total plant cover (Fig. 7).  These data suggest that seeding has 
limited effect on overall cover during the first five years after fire events.  Seeded cover 
remained relatively high for the first three years after fire (in fact almost exactly the same 
as control cover during the first two years), but dropped off substantially to 13% and 14% 
in years four and five, respectively.  The higher initial seeded cover suggests that one of 
the major goals of post-fire rehabilitation was being effectively met through seeding: 
seeded species established themselves quickly and lasted for a few years, but then 
decreased relative to other species.  However, total cover in seeded sites and controls 
were nearly identical by years four and five suggesting that the remaining seeded species 
may be offsetting local plant species which would otherwise occupy the site.  Regardless 
of species seeded, total cover values converged at four to five years post-fire.  This 
suggests that ecosystems may only support a threshold level of plant cover (Connell and 

36 
 
Slatyer 1977; Noble and Slatyer 1977), and post-fire seeding actually suppresses the 
establishment of local species after fires (Keeley et al. 1981; Taskey et al. 1989).  Data 
from this review cannot assess the differences in vegetation composition between seeded 
and non-seeded sites.  Longer-term monitoring results (e.g., > 5 years) are needed to 
assess lasting impacts of seeded species.  Assessment of soil seedbanks is also needed to 
determine whether seed of non-persistent species can remain viable within the seed bank 
(Griffin 1982). 
 
Seven of nine papers (78%) reviewed assessing the effect of seeding on native 
species richness reported adverse effects, while the remaining two showed no difference 
in native species richness on seeded versus unseeded controls.   Eighty-six percent of the 
papers providing highest and high quality evidence reported that seeding decreased on 
native species richness.  Two-thirds of these papers have been published since 2000.  
Reduced native species richness is often a function of high dominance by seeded species 
(Conard et al. 1991; Amaranthus et al. 1993; Sexton 1998; Schoennagel and Waller 1999; 
Keeley 2004).  Authors defined seeded species dominance in terms of high cover, 
biomass, density, and/or frequency.  In five cases, studies reported high seeded species 
dominance coincident with reduced native species richness.  Conversely, Kruse et al. 
(2004) reported cereal barley (Hordeum vulgare) cover to have no effect on native 
richness on a fire in northern California.  Instead, this study linked reduced native species 
richness with cover of straw mulch, showing that direct competition for water or nutrients 
with actively growing seeded species was not the only way for a suppressive effect to 
occur (Kruse et al. 2004).   Barclay et al. (2004) only noted a reduction in native forb 
richness in the second year following fire in north-central New Mexico.  However, this 

37 
 
reduction coincided with low seeded annual ryegrass cover.  The authors suggested that 
dominant ryegrass cover may have led to the suppression of native species in the first 
year, causing subsequent lack of reproduction of native forbs in the second year after 
ryegrass left the system.  However, total cover was also reported to be low; thus, the 
overall abundance of seeded species in comparison to all species may have remained 
relatively high.  In the two studies noting no difference in native species richness between 
seeded and unseeded plots, one showed inadequate cover of seeded annual species in 
both the first and second year post-fire in the Southwest (Stella 2009).  The other 
demonstrated that although seeded non-native annual and perennial grass and legume 
species had high dominance (cover and frequency) in seeded plots in the eastern 
Cascades, a native pinegrass (Calamagrostis rubescens) also dominated the site which 
may have counteracted any effects of seeded species dominance (Schoennagel 1997).  
 
Overall, the reviewed literature suggests that seeded species dominance plays a 
critical role in determing species richness in the first and/or second year after fire.  In 
cases where seeding is successful, reduced native species richness is a likely result.  
Mulching may also provide as much as an inhibitory effect on native species as seeded 
species (Schuman et al. 1991; Bakker et al. 2003; Kruse et al. 2004) as well as having the 
ability to introduce non-species if the mulch used for rehabilitation is not free of weeds 
(Kruse et al. 2004).  
 
A number of studies examined competitive effects of seeded grasses on woody 
plant establishment.  The ability of seeded grasses to compete with woody plant species 
can be viewed as positive or negative depending on the ecosystem or site being 
rehabilitated, although we assessed the latter.  Of those papers investigating post-fire 

38 
 
seeding (non-native and/or native species) effects on tree seedling growth and shrub 
cover (14 papers), the majority (79%, 11 papers) found seeding to have adverse impacts 
on these variables.  All studies used for this comparison seeded only graminoids in 
treated plots.  Half of the papers providing highest to high quality evidence (2 out of 4 
papers) showed seeding negatively affected tree seedling and/or shrub growth and 
survival.  One paper reported seeding had no effect on the growth and survival of tree and 
shrub species, while the other showed seeding improved establishment.  Of five studies 
quantifying shrub cover in sites seeded with non-native species versus unseeded controls 
(16 sites), shrub cover in unseeded plots was almost always higher than in seeded plots 
(Fig. 8).   
 
Soil moisture likely influences establishment and survival of trees and shrubs; soil 
moisture can be depleted more rapidly on seeded sites yielding high plant production, 
thus limiting water availability to woody plant species (Elliott and White 1987).  For 
example, Amaranthus et al. (1993) demonstrated that seeded annual ryegrass suppressed 
first-year pine seedling growth in southwestern Oregon by lowering soil moisture 
availability and reducing root-tip and mycorrhiza formation, necessary components for 
conifer seedlings’ establishment.  In contrast, Sexton (1998) noted no difference in tree 
and shrub seedlings’ establishment on seeded annual ryegrass plots versus controls in 
south-central Oregon and he also noted that soil moisture was similar on seeded and 
control plots.  A prescribed burn study in northwestern Arizona showed increased shrub 
cover on seeded plots, but shrubs were included in the seeding treatment (Springer et al. 
2001).  Eight out of nine (89%) studies in the lower quality of evidence categories 
consistently showed reduced conifer seedlings and/or shrub growth and survival on sites 

39 
 
dominated by seeded annual non-native species (Griffin 1982; Conard et al. 1991; 
Schoennagel and Waller 1999; Barclay et al. 2004; Keeley 2004; Kruse 2004). These 
results suggest that seeding non-native annual species may negatively affect woody plant 
species through competition for available resources (specifically soil moisture), space, 
and light during the first two years after fire (Beyers 2004). 
 
Does seeding reduce non-native species invasions?  
 
In eleven of the twelve papers with direct evidence regarding the role of seeding 
in reducing non-native species abundance, more than half (56%, 6 papers) showed 
seeding (non-natives and/or native species) to be effective, whereas 45% (5 papers) 
showed seeding did not reduce non-native species’ abundance.  When considering quality 
of evidence criteria, three out of five papers (60%) of highest quality showed seeding to 
be effective, compared to two out of five (40%) finding seeding to be ineffective for 
reducing non-natives.  However, two of the three highest quality studies showing seeding 
to be effective were conducted in prescribed burn or slash pile burned areas. Two of the 
three papers of high quality showed seeding to be ineffective for reducing non-natives 
species.  When we include studies of both highest and high quality evidence for 
evaluation, an equal amount of papers (50% each) found seeding to be either effective or 
ineffective.  The remaining three lower quality-of-evidence categories gave mixed 
results.  
 
From these results, determining whether seeding is effective in reducing non-
natives is difficult.  However, of the papers showing seeding to be effective, 83% 
incorporated non-native or exotic annual species into seeding treatments.  Successful 

40 
 
exclusion of non-natives is generally reported when seeded species have high dominance 
(Barclay et al. 2004; Keeley 2004).  Thus, the high percentage of studies reviewed 
showing successful suppression of undesirable species or noxious weeds appears to result 
from the competitive advantage of non-native annual or perennial seeded species in 
increasing dominance (Schoennagel and Waller 1999; Barclay et al. 2004; Keeley 2004).  
However, it is well-documented that these seeded species also may competitively 
displace native species (Sexton 1998; Schoennagel and Waller 1999; Barclay et al. 2004; 
Keeley 2004; Logar 2006).  Although annual or non-persistent species are often selected 
because they are believed to disappear in one year, studies have shown they can persist 
beyond the first and second year post-fire (Sexton 1998; Barclay et al. 2004).  Thus, the 
problems of using non-native annual or non-persistent species is two-fold: 1) rapid die-
off of annual or non-persistent species after the first year post-fire may re-create 
conditions suitable for exotic invasions; and 2) continued persistence of these species 
could introduce new non-natives genotypes to native plant communities.  
 
Sixty percent of the papers reporting seeding treatments to be ineffective in 
reducing non-natives reported no significant difference in cover between seeded and 
unseeded sites (Sexton 1998; Hunter and Omi 2006; Stella 2009).  Hunter et al. (2006) 
showed that undesirable species cover was positively associated with seeded species 
cover.  Unsuccessful attempts in reducng non-natives may be therefore attributed in part 
to the production of inadequate cover to exclude non-natives.  Four of the five studies 
(80%) reporting seeding as ineffective used non-native species solely or in mixes with 
natives.  In three cases, seeded non-persistent species persisted beyond the first year post-
fire (VanZuuk 1997, Sexton 1998, Hunter et al. 2006).  Thus, these treatments also 

41 
 
intentionally introduced non-natives which may have negative consequences on native 
plant communities.  Moreover, in two out of three ineffective treatments using mixes 
comprised of native and non-native species, seed mixes were contaminated with exotics 
(Sexton 1998; Hunter et al. 2006).   This adds to evidence suggesting that broad 
application of seed mixes following fire may promote establishment of non-native 
species due to contamination of these mixes.  
 
The use of native species may be preferable to seeding non-natives, but few 
studies have investigated the use of native species for reducing non-native invasions.  Of 
the papers reviewed regarding this issue, only three investigated the use of native seed 
mixes for seeding burned areas.  However, of these, only one was conducted after a 
wildfire (Stella 2009). In the remaining two papers, one was conducted following a 
prescribed burn in northwestern Arizona (Springer et al. 2001), the other examined 
seeding following slash pile burning in northern Arizona (Korb et al. 2004).  Stella 
(2009) found that non-native species richness and abundance did not differ among 
seeding treatments incorporating non-native and native species’ mixes on three high-
severity wildfires in Arizona.  Springer et al. (2001) found that seeding certified “weed-
free” native seeds were ineffective in reducing non-natives, whereas Korb et al. (2004) 
noted seeding of native species was effective although only with the addition of soil 
amendments.  Based upon the limited number of studies available, it is hard to determine 
if the use of native species for seeding can help to prevent non-native invasions although 
two of three papers suggest seeding with native species is ineffective.  However, some 
native grasses have been shown to suppress growth of conifer seedlings (Larson & 
Schubert 1969; Pearson 1972), and using non-local native seed sources may contaminate 

42 
 
local gene pools (Huenneke 1991; Schmid 1994; Linhart 1995; Hufford and Mazer 2003; 
Rogers and Montalvo 2004).  Conserving local genotypes of plant populations is a vital 
mechanism by which plant communities can adapt and evolve to survive in a changing 
climate (Huenneke 1991, Rogers and Montalvo 2004).  Thus, incorporating locally-
adapted and genetically appropriate seed sources in post-fire seeding treatments should 
be of importance.  
 
Information on the effectiveness of seeding in curtailing non-native species is 
based on a limited number of papers, 12, all of which were published since 1998.  This 
perhaps is due to the recent emphasis on seeding to displace or prevent non-native 
species.  Longer-term quantitative monitoring is needed to assess the overall 
effectiveness of seeding to prevent non-native species invasions. 
 
Conclusions 
 
Severe wildfires have profound effects on soils and plant communities.  Over the 
last decade areas of high-severity forest fires have increased by as much as an order of 
magnitude in the western United States (Westerling et al. 2006).  Climate projections 
consistently indicate that trends in increasing size and severity of wildfires will continue 
(McKenzie et al. 2004).  If correct, the need to rehabilitate burned areas will undoubtedly 
escalate.  Across agencies, post-fire seeding treatments continue to be used as a first choice 
rehabilitation measure, although use of these treatments in achieving specified rehabilitation 
objectives remains highly debated.   
 
Across 94 reviewed papers, seeding has both positive and negative effects on 
post-fire ecosystems.  Seeding was shown to be effective in increasing plant cover to 
reduce soil erosion; but few studies showed that the reductions in eroded sediment on 

43 
 
seeded sites were significantly lower relative to controls.  In fact, untreated controls 
appeared to recover as effectively from the effects of erosion compared to sites seeded.  
These results suggest that seeding has minimal potential to reduce erosion, especially not 
in the first critical erosion years after fire (Kruse et al. 2004).  Mulching appears to have 
greater impact in reducing soil erosion than seeding; however, mulching may also 
negatively affect ecosystems by suppressing plant community recovery and introducing 
non-native species.  Increased research investigating the effects and effectiveness of 
mulching are needed to clarify the impacts of this practice within post-fire ecosystems. 
Seeding effects on plant community recovery are similar to those on soil erosion; 
seeding increases plant cover in the first several years after fire, but cover of seeded sites 
appears to stabilize at the same rate as unseeded sites by the fourth and fifth year post-
fire.  Seeded species tend to decline rapidly after the first two years after seeding; 
however individuals do persist for several years after seeding, especially when perennial 
species are used.  This is concerning in that use of annual cereal grains and sterile hybrid 
grains has increased under the premise that these species disappear quickly; yet some 
studies showed their ability to persist.  Furthermore, rapid establishment of seeded non-
natives often leads to suppression of native species and ineffective recovery after seeded 
non-natives disappear.  Although seeding with native species has increased, natives are 
typically used in mixes with non-native species, and are rarely used by themselves.  As a 
result studies examining the effects of seeding with purely native species are extremely 
limited.  Furthermore, seeding with “native” species from distant sources may also have 
detrimental effects on local plant gene pools (Huenneke 1991; Linhart 1995; Hufford and 
Mazer 2003; Rogers and Montalvo 2004).  Therefore, locally-adapted and genetically-

44 
 
appropriate seed sources should be used when seeding treatments incorporate native 
species.  Until supplies of these species increase, alternative rehabilitation methods (e.g. 
mulching, log-erosion barriers) should be considered.  
 
In recent years, the use of post-fire seeding to reduce non-native species invasion 
has increased, but studies quantifying the effectiveness of seeding treatments to reduce 
these invasions are limited.   Regardless, seeding was only effective in curtailing non-
native species invasions about 50% of the time; of those treatments the majority 
introduced additional negative impacts on native communities by seeding with non-native 
species.  We were unable to determine whether seeding with natives would be more 
effective; more work is needed to determine their effectiveness to reduce non-native plant 
invasions.  
 
The scientific rigor of studies has increased since recent reviews on post-fire 
seeding (Robichaud et al. 2000; Beyers 2004) declared a need for better designed studies 
to evaluate the effectiveness of seeding.  Evidence that seeding may be ineffective in 
meeting post-fire management objectives has strengthened as improved sampling designs 
have rendered more statistically robust data.  The scientific literature and monitoring data 
show that costly post-fire seeding does little to protect soil and promote plant recovery in 
the short-term but has the ability to introduce potentially negative effects with long-term 
ecological consequences.   Erosion may be better controlled by mulching, but care must be 
taken to ensure that mulch is free of non-native seed.  Plant community recovery may be 
improved with the use of locally-adapted, genetically appropriate plant materials, 
although more research regarding the effects and effectiveness of these species is critical.  
If the only choice is to use mulch potentially contaminated with non-native seed or seed 

45 
 
from species of unknown collection and genetic origin, taking no action may be the best 
alternative.  Lastly, early detection of new undesirable species invasions through 
monitoring of post-fire environments in combination with rapid response methods to 
quickly contain, deny reproduction, and eliminate these  invasions (Westbrooks 2004), 
may allow better control of non-native species invasions.

CHAPTER THREE 
Market perceptions and opportunities for native plant production 
on the southern Colorado Plateau 
Abstract 
Increases in revegetation activities have created a large demand for locally-adapted native 
plant materials in the southwestern United States.  Currently there is a minimal supply of 
local genotypes to meet this demand.  We investigated the potential for the initiation of a 
native plant market in the southern Colorado Plateau.  Through a literature search, 
interviews, and site visits, we identified existing native plant markets outside of the 
region as useful models to help initiate a regional market.  We used web-based surveys to 
identify and analyze current and future native plant material needs and concerns.  Survey 
results indicate that management policy strongly drives decisions regarding the use and 
purchase of native plant materials.  From a demand perspective, lack of availability and 
cost of native plant materials has kept purchasing minimal, despite policy changes 
favoring the use of natives.  For suppliers, further development of native plant materials 
is limited by inconsistent and unreliable demand and lack of production knowledge.  The 
knowledge and tools necessary to initiate a native plant materials market are available, 
but inadequate funding sources and insufficient information sharing hinder its 
development.  Communication among producers, land managers, buyers, and researchers, 
as well as partnerships with local growers, appear to be vital to initiating a functional 
market.

Introduction 
Over the past century, in the Southwest, land use and management practices in 
conjunction with changing climate conditions have led to alteration of native ecosystems 
and a fire regime shift from frequent, low-intensity surface fires to large high-intensity 
crown fires (Covington & Moore 1994; Westerling et al. 2006).  Many native species in 
southwestern Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws. (ponderosa pine) forests are well adapted 
to periodic drought and fires of low intensity (Hunter & Omi 2006).  However, drought 
conditions and wildfires are projected to increase in the region (McKenzie et al. 2004; 
Westerling et al. 2006; Seager et al. 2007).  As a result, prolonged drought stress and a 
changing fire regime may have direct effects on local plant community composition and 
structure (Hanson & Weltzin 2000; Wang & Kemball 2005; Hunter & Omi 2006).  In 
light of these concerns, interest in restoring these disturbed lands has become more 
widespread (Allen et al. 2002; McKay et al. 2005).  
In recent years with major fires such as the 2000 Cerro Grande and the 2002 
Rodeo-Chediski, wildfires have arguably become the primary driver of restoration and 
rehabilitation efforts in the Southwest (Friederici 2003).   Land management agencies 
such as the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) are 
required to prescribe emergency watershed-rehabilitation measures when and where 
deemed necessary to (1) stabilize soil; (2) control water, sediment, and debris movement; 
(3) prevent ecosystem degradation; and (4) to minimize threats to human life or property.  
Among post-fire rehabilitation treatments, grass seeding is the most commonly used and 
cost effective method to stabilize soils and establish ground cover for erosion control 

65 
 
(Richards et al. 1998; Robichaud et al. 2000; Beyers 2004; Wolfson & Sieg, In press) on 
firelines and hillslope areas determined to require protection.  
In Arizona and New Mexico, both the area burned by wildfire and the funding 
allocated for post-fire seeding have increased dramatically in the last 30 years (Wolfson 
& Sieg, In press, Fig. 1).   Regionally, seed used for post-fire seeding has shifted from 
mixes dominated by perennial non-native species to mixes incorporating more native 
species (Wolfson & Sieg, in press), although non-natives are still used.  Beyond post-
wildfire rehabilitation, revegetation is an integral component of other land management 
practices in the region including invasive species management, livestock grazing, wildlife 
habitat management, roadside rehabilitation, mine reclamation, and recreational use.  
Within the last 30 years, revegetation policies have increasingly stressed using 
native plant materials (NPM), and more recently, recognized the importance of using 
locally-adapted NPM during restoration and rehabilitation activities (Richards et al. 1998, 
Erickson 2008).  However, although national policies for federal land management 
agencies like the USFS and BLM direct the use of native plant species as a first choice in 
revegetation activities, non-native species may be used when using native species is 
deemed impractical (Richards et al. 1998; Soller 2003; Beyers 2004); for example, in 
emergency conditions to protect resource values or when native plant materials are not 
available or economically feasible (Erickson 2008).  Consequently, non-native species 
continue to be used in revegetation projects throughout the region often due to the 
increasing need for post-fire emergency rehabilitation in conjunction with the lack of 
availability and high cost of NPM (Wolfson & Sieg In press) which are locally-adapted 

66 
 
and genetically compatible with existing plant populations (Rogers & Montalvo 2004) 
(hereafter “local genotypes”). 
New revegetation policies and funding sources have emerged as a result of 
increased recognition from Congress of the need for an abundant supply of NPM and the 
establishment of the Federal Interagency Native Plant Materials Development Committee 
in 2000 (USDA & USDI 2002).  Since 2000 interagency projects have been developed to 
meet the need for increased NPM availability and production information (Pellant et al. 
2004; Shaw et al. 2005).  Unfortunately, only minimal efforts currently exist in the 
Southwest and, due to the lack of local genotypes available, federal, state, tribal, 
nonprofit, and private entities presently purchase restoration materials from distant 
sources.  Thus, regional projects continually incorporate non-local genetic materials 
which may be more susceptible to the negative effects of changing environments 
(Huenneke 1991; Schmid 1994; Rogers & Montalvo 2004) and threaten the long-term 
sustainability of restored sites (Lynch 1991; Hufford & Mazer 2003), as well as other 
local populations (Linhart 1995; Montalvo & Ellstrand 2001) with which they may 
interbreed. 
With NPM production efforts currently established in surrounding regions, 
increased policy recognizing the value of using NPM, and needs for locally-adapted plant 
supplies, market opportunities exist that may directly benefit the southern Colorado 
Plateau’s diverse ecosystems.  This study addresses the following four questions: 1) 
Could native plant markets outside of the region serve as models to guide the 
development of a NPM market in the region? 2) What role does current policy play on 
the use and demand for NPM? 3) What are the needs and concerns of both supply and 

67 
 
demand stakeholders involved with NPM? 4) What factors limit the initiation of a NPM 
market in the southern Colorado Plateau?   
 
Methods 
This study assesses the opportunity to initiate a native plant and seed industry in 
the southern Colorado Plateau (Fig. 2).  To explore market development methodologies 
and perceptions, we investigated existing native plant markets and administered web-
based surveys to natural resource professionals and selected seed companies in the 
southern Colorado Plateau and in nearby regions.  
To identify potential models which could be used to help guide the development 
of a regionally based NPM market, we reviewed current literature including scientific 
journals, unpublished theses and reports, and government documents.  We then 
interviewed natural resource professionals within the region to gain further insight on 
markets previously identified.  The most relevant markets were selected based on their 
similarity to the southern Colorado Plateau’s size and market demands.   
We developed two distinct web-based surveys to assess current native plant 
market perceptions.  A demand survey was administered to a target group of individuals 
from federal, state, private, and nonprofit entities who were actively involved in 
restoration in the region (Table 1a, Appendix II).  A supply survey was administered to a 
targeted group of individuals from both large and small-scale seed production companies 
in Arizona, New Mexico, nearby western and Great Plains states, and other successful 
seed production companies (Table 1b, Appendix II).  Complete details on the survey 
methodology are available from the authors (Appendix III). 

68 
 
  
We developed 42 questions for the demand survey and 37 questions for the 
supply survey based on preliminary information from interviews and current literature 
(Richards et al. 1998; Soller 2003; Hooper 2003).  Each survey question was arranged 
into a series of related survey questions and placed within five thematic areas pertaining 
to NPM: 1) policy and regulation; 2) issues and concerns; 3) purchasing and 
expenditures; 4) future use and needs; and 5) collaboration and funding.  We created and 
administered finalized surveys (42 demand and 39 supply) online (Andrews et al. 2003; 
Kaplowitz et al. 2004; Ryu et al. 2005) using the web tool SurveyMonkey 
(www.surveymonkey.com). 
 
Analysis of final survey response datasets was completed using Statistical 
Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (SPSS 2007).  We calculated survey 
answer frequencies (n) and valid percents of respondent participation for each question.  
Survey responses “Don’t know” and “Decline to answer” are not included in the valid 
percent calculations.  For questions that offered multiple responses, total percentages may 
exceed 100.  Percents are rounded which may cause totals to be slightly greater or less 
than 100%. 
 
Results 
Model Markets 
We identified the BLM Great Basin Restoration Initiative’s (GBRI) Great Basin 
Native Plant Selection and Increase Project (GB Project) and the Uncompahgre Plateau 
Project’s Native Plant Program (UP Project) as useful models for guiding the 
development of a native plant market in the southern Colorado Plateau.  Within their 

69 
 
respective regions, these Projects have helped to increase the supply of NPM for 
restoration practices through multi-organizational collaborations and partnerships with 
private growers (Pellant et al. 2004; US GAO 2008a).   Funding provided to the Projects 
is used, in part, to conduct research on key native plant species to develop critical 
production methodologies and seed sources.  Research results and information are then 
transferred to growers and land managers.  In addition, growers are given an opportunity 
to participate in buy-back programs, which aim to encourage suppliers to grow native 
species not yet marketed (Shaw et al. 2005; UP Project 2007).  Under the buy-back 
program, minimal amounts of stock seed, along with associated production information is 
provided to growers under an agreement that the Projects will buy-back a small portion of 
the seed produced for distribution to additional growers or in some cases to provide NPM 
for research needs.  Meanwhile, growers are given a chance to sell the additional seed 
produced on the open market.   
Within the Great Basin, market demands are primarily driven by needs of 
government agencies for post-fire rehabilitation and restoration (GBRI 2001).  Funded 
entirely through the BLM GBRI, total five-year funding for the GB Project was 
approximately $4.5 to $6 million between 2001 and 2006 (GBRI 2001, Pellant 2006).  
On the Uncompahgre Plateau, although market demands are driven by private and public 
land needs for habitat improvement, NPM production focuses on providing local-source 
seed for government agency use.  The UP Project, which was modeled after the GB 
Project, has a separate nonprofit management group as well as a formalized 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the BLM, USFS, and the Colorado 
Division of Wildlife which allows the group to receive both direct and in-kind funding 

70 
 
from federal, state, private, and nonprofit entities (US GAO 2008a).  Additional funding 
provides financial support to local growers for producing NPM.  Between 2002 and 2007, 
the program received approximately $2.4 million in funding, with the majority coming 
from the BLM (50%) and the USDA Forest Service (USFS) (35%) (UP Project 2007).  
Based on annual operating costs for both the GB and UP Projects, the estimated cost for 
collection, research, increase, and release is approximately $15,000-25,000 per species 
annually and requires approximately four to 12 years to develop a species (CPNPI 2007).  
 
Survey 
We received 37 completed demand (88% response rate) and 33 completed supply 
(85% response rate) surveys from the targeted sample group (Appendix IV).  Due to non-
random sample selection and a small sample size (demand survey n = 42, supply survey  
n = 39), extrapolation of results and conclusions to a larger population should be 
considered cautiously (Babbie 2004); however, an effort was made to include all 
involved stakeholders.   
The majority of demand survey respondents were employed by “federal” or 
“state” agencies (47% and 27% respectively), and currently implemented seeding as a 
management practice (83%).  Of supply survey respondents, 94% were currently 
involved in selling NPM of which the majority (97%) sold either “native seed” solely 
(32%) or NPM and non-native seed (65%).   
 

71 
 
Native plant policy and regulation 
Demand respondents indicated that “organization policy” (25%) followed by 
“availability of native seed” (21%) were the most important factors influencing the 
purchase of native seed.  The majority (80%) of respondents’ organizations or agencies 
currently required the use of certified native seed; seed meeting certification procedures 
which provide verification of source, genetic identity, and genetic purity of wildland 
collected or field grown plant germplasm materials (AOSCA 2003).  For those 
organizations or agencies that did not currently require the use of certified native seed, 
67% of the respondents anticipated requirements to do so within the next five years.   
 
Native plant material concerns 
The majority of all respondents (65%) found defining the term “local genotype” 
difficult and suggested the definition is species specific and highly dependent upon 
topography, elevation, and climatic conditions within a region.  In follow-up questions, 
an overwhelming majority of buyers (93%) indicated that their organization was 
concerned about the genetic source of native seed; yet 41% of respondents used non-
native seeds in restoration efforts.  Half of demand respondents agreed “lack of 
availability” was the primary limiting factor preventing their organization from buying 
local seeds and “availability” (27%) along with the “cost” (22%) of seed were the 
greatest obstacles to overcome in order to initiate a successful NPM market in the 
southern Colorado Plateau (Fig. 3a).  The majority of buyers (87%) foresaw a need for 
local genotypes for seeding practices within the next five years.  

72 
 
Producing local genotypes was “somewhat” (47%) or “very important” (33%) to 
suppliers and the majority (70%) agreed that there is a current market for local genotypes 
used in large-scale restoration projects.  However, suppliers commented that supplying 
local genotypes is difficult due to the costs and limited resources available during the 
wildland seed harvesting and agricultural seed production process.  In addition, growers 
were more interested in supplying seed that is currently in large demand.  Furthermore, 
from the supply perspective, the “lack of consistent and reliable demand” (38%), and 
“knowledge of native plant production” (21%) were the most significant limitations to 
supplying NPM (Fig. 3b).   
 
Native plant material use and needs 
Of demand respondents who currently seed, just over one-quarter (26%) primarily 
apply seed for “ecological restoration;” while “wildlife habitat improvement” and 
“burned area rehabilitation” were close seconds (22% each, Fig. 3c).  When demand 
respondents were asked about the five most desirable species to be brought into 
commercial production (n=149), respondents selected in order of highest demand (23% 
of the total responses):  Bouteloua gracilis (Willd. ex Kunth) Lag. ex Griffiths (blue 
grama), Festuca arizonica Vasey (Arizona fescue), Elymus elymoides (Raf.) Swezey 
(squirreltail), Atriplex canescens (Pursh) Nutt. (fourwing saltbush), and Poa fendleriana 
(Steud.) Vasey (muttongrass).  In contrast, among all responses from suppliers (n=53), 
the five species for seeds in highest demand (19% of the total responses), in order of 
frequency were:  Pseudoroegneria spicata (Pursh) A. Löve (bluebunch wheatgrass), 
Achnatherum hymenoides (Roem. & Schult.) Barkworth (Indian ricegrass), Pascopyrum 

73 
 
smithii (Rydb.) A. Löve (western wheatgrass), Elymus lanceolatus (Scribn. & J.G. Sm.) 
Gould (thickspike wheatgrass), and Elymus elymoides.  Overall, seed of grass species was 
in highest demand by both demand and supply respondents, but only Elymus elymoides 
was listed among the top five by both groups; this difference in plant lists was a direct 
result of buyers and suppliers being surveyed in different geographic areas.  Appendix V 
provides a complete species list (scientific names and authorities) of native and non-native 
species used throughout the surveys. 
 
Native plant material purchasing and expenditures 
The BLM spent the most on NPM in 2006, followed by the USFS (Fig. 3d).  In 
2006, the top two management activities for which native seed was purchased included 
“burned area rehabilitation” and “ecological restoration.”  However, 61% of all the native 
seed purchased was for burned area rehabilitation activities (10,843 kilograms), 
amounting to 42% of the overall expenditures on native seed in 2006 ($344,000, Fig. 4).  
According to the demand survey, almost half (44%) of respondents’ native seed supply 
came from out-of-state sources within the same ecological region in which the 
rehabilitation or restoration was conducted (e.g. Great Basin, Colorado Plateau, etc.). 
 
Collaboration and funding 
Among buyers, collaboration occurred most often between “federal” (22%) and 
“state” agencies (20%).  Over one-half (57%) of buyers currently received “federal” or 
“state” monies or incentives to assist with seeding practices.  Most suppliers’ (62%) 
current native plant operations are supported internally, while one-third (33%) are 
supported by both internal and external funding.

Discussion 
Market models and survey results revealed that many factors limit the NPM 
market in the southern Colorado Plateau, including the need for: 1) stronger collaboration 
among federal, state, private, and nonprofit entities; 2) increased communication among 
seed producers, land managers, buyers, and researchers; 3) funding mechanisms for 
development of local genotype plant materials; 4) an agreement regarding the scale of 
“local-genotypes” 5) increased availability and reduced costs of local genotypes; and 6) 
native plant market stability.  
The GB and UP Projects were useful models in guiding development of a NPM 
market in the southern Colorado Plateau.  These projects provide a framework of how 
factors related to limited collaboration, insufficient funding, and lack of communication 
can be overcome.  It appears that multi-agency collaboration can be used to acquire long-
term funding sources needed to increase NPM development.  These models suggest that 
between $2.4 and $6 million over a five-year period is needed to initiate a similar project 
in the southern Colorado Plateau (GBRI 2001; Pellant 2006; UP Project 2007).   
Partnerships between government agencies and private growers appear to be 
essential as improved information sharing and buy-back options give growers tools and 
incentives needed to enhance development of NPM.  Beyond buy-back options, 
stewardship contracting, available through the BLM and USFS, authorize these agencies 
to enter into long-term agreements (up to 10 years) with communities, private sectors, 
and others to meet land management objectives associated with improving forest and 
rangeland health while benefiting communities (US GAO 2008b).  Indefinite-delivery/ 
indefinite-quantity contracts (which agree to award payment upon completion of 

75 
 
specified tasks in a fixed period of time) have also been used by the BLM and USFS in 
several western states to produce required quantities of seed from specific areas for 
planned projects (Erickson 2008; Nancy Shaw, USDA Forest Service, personal 
communication).  Utilizing contracting options provided through the USFS and BLM 
would further encourage market development.  
Our survey indicates that policy strongly influences agency decisions regarding 
NPM use.  Due in part to difficulties interpreting current native plant policy and 
economic constraints, federal policy on use of NPM has been implemented erratically 
(Richards et al. 1998) and on the southern Colorado Plateau, lack of availability and high 
costs of local genotypes has made existing native plant policies moot, thereby allowing 
the continued use of non-native species (Wolfson & Sieg, in press).  Stronger and more 
consistent policies for their use (Richards et al. 1998) could enhance the regions’ NPM 
market potential by helping to increase their demand.  For example, implementation of 
stronger native plant policies has stimulated the development of new certified seed 
categories that accommodate the use of native plant germplasm (Jones & Young 2005).  
According to current literature (Jones & Young 2005; Loftin 2004), many states have 
adopted seed certification policies specifically accommodating NPM and, because of this, 
suppliers now offer certified native seed as the demand for it has increased.  
According to the survey, the genetic source of seed appears to be a concern for 
land managers and seed companies, yet an inconsistent demand and lack of reliable 
production knowledge make suppliers hesitant in furthering the development of local 
genotype plant materials.  These issues are further complicated by difficulties in 
determining what constitutes a “local genotype” (Mortlock 1999; Burton & Burton 2002; 

76 
 
Williams & Price 2002) as well as by varying requests for species, types of genetic 
materials, and amounts needed.  Confusion over these issues creates dilemmas for 
suppliers when faced with deciding on what types and how much material to produce and 
market (Hooper 2003).   Determining target species, finding common ground on the 
genetic classification of local plant materials, and consolidating NPM requests are critical 
first steps to effectively building a regional NPM market and developing local genotype 
plant materials.  
One approach to the “local genotype” scale issue is to delineate seed transfer 
zones based upon geographic and elevational boundaries in which plant materials can be 
transferred with little risk of being poorly adapted (Mahalovich & McArthur 2004, Aubry 
et al. 2005).  Forested areas of Arizona and New Mexico are already divided into 10 
physiographic-climatic tree seed zones (Schubert & Pitcher 1973), which could be used 
as surrogates for grass seed transfer zones (Soller 2003).  Consistent funding for research 
and development will be needed to enable completion of research projects exploring the 
basic genetic information for determining appropriate seed collection zones. 
According to the survey, suppliers appear to lack the knowledge necessary to 
successfully produce NPM.  Over the years a wealth of information has been 
accumulated regarding NPM production.  Within the region, increased information 
transfer regarding available production guidelines (Potts et al. 2002) would further 
encourage potential suppliers to grow needed NPM.  Greater information sharing may 
also help to lower NPM costs by providing suppliers with cost-effective production 
techniques.  Minimal research may be needed to develop production guidelines for 
regionally-specific species for which information is not available.  

77 
 
According to our survey results, focusing on grass seed production will be 
important during the market initiation phase.  Demand for grass species is promising as 
the majority of research on NPM production has focused on development of grass species 
(Robichaud et al. 2000).  Many of the desirable grass species identified are readily 
available through commercial seed producers outside the region.  Therefore, focusing on 
producing and marketing locally collected and grown grass species (e.g. specialty 
market) could alleviate competition pressure from non-regional suppliers.  
Specialty NPM markets have been assessed in Nevada and created in Utah.  In 
2005, the Nevada Wildland Seed Producers Association requested a feasibility study to 
evaluate the potential for a native plant and seed market, as well as interests in forming a 
cooperative among Nevada NPM producers (Curtis et al. 2005).  Within this cooperative, 
30 producers each invest approximately $5,000 and obtain additional funding through 
credit or loan options to finance the cooperative start-up cost.  Profits are made by 
marketing locally developed, certified, and labeled “Nevada Grown” materials.  This 
study estimated total operational expenses at approximately $6 million annually.  Utah 
Intermountain Native Plant Growers Association produced a similar market for “Utah 
Choice” NPM (Meyer 2005).  The Nevada and Utah NPM markets appear to be primarily 
supported by demand for NPM for fire prevention and rehabilitation efforts (Curtis et al. 
2005, Meyer 2005).  
Burned area rehabilitation plays a large role in the demand for and purchase of 
NPM in the southern Colorado Plateau, specifically grasses used for post-fire seeding 
(Beyers 2004, Wolfson & Sieg in press).  Our survey indicates that the BLM followed by 
the USFS purchase the majority of the seed in the region and according to agency policy 

78 
 
the use of native species is preferred (USDA & USDI 2002).  The total burned area that 
has been seeded within USFS Region 3 has increased annually since 1990 (Table 2).  
Assuming that policies continue to favor seeding following disturbance, a future native 
plant market may continue to be driven by federal government demand for post-fire 
seeding materials, and more specifically those which are native.  
The variable demand for NPM results from unpredictable fire frequency and size 
(Richards et al. 1998; USDA & USDI 2002; Jones and Young 2005).  The 
unpredictability of fires from year to year can cause high demands for large quantities of 
native grass seed at short notice, and often at a time when NPM supplies are low (Dunne 
& Dunne 2003).  In turn this forces buyers to purchase materials from outside the region 
(Curtis et al. 2005) at high costs (Dunne & Dunne 2003).  Increasing the region’s storage 
capacity (USDA & USDI 2002; Soller 2003) may be one way to address issues of on-
demand availability and alleviate high market prices often associated with native seed in 
short supply (Jones & Young 2005).  Adequate long-term seed storage facilities would 
allow for seed to be purchased and stored in favorable seed production years (Williams & 
Price 2002; USDA & USDI 2002, Soller 2003).  This would stabilize availability during 
unfavorable seasons (Mortlock 1998) or in heavy fire years.  However, suppliers 
answering the survey stressed that providing NPM for an unreliable market is often 
infeasible and that it is more profitable to produce and sell NPM which have the highest 
consistent demand.  Moreover, suppliers surveyed expressed that lack of funding is a 
major obstacle in providing native seed, which is often limited due to the greater costs 
associated with collecting and producing it (Mortlock 1998; Burton & Burton 2002).  
Forms of contracting may be necessary to insure growers that the seed they produce will 

79 
 
be purchased and, in some instances, provide them with seed stock accompanied by 
associated production information.  A synergistic approach of increasing storage capacity 
while offering suppliers market incentives may provide an effective mechanism to 
increase the supply of needed NPM within the region. 
 
What is needed for market initiation? 
A diverse approach is needed to overcome the many challenges of initiating a 
NPM market in the southern Colorado Plateau.  Based on the GB Project and the UP 
Project, greater collaboration, funding opportunities, and communication are essential to 
increasing NPM.  Because of the large role that policy plays in agencies’ decisions 
regarding when and where to use and purchase NPM, stronger policies and support from 
federal and state governments (Mortlock 1998) will be needed to help increase supplies 
and lower cost of local genotype plant materials.  
There is an apparent disconnect between market perceptions among buyers and 
producers.  It is clear that for a market to be developed, an integrated collaborative 
strategy is needed among producers, land managers, government agencies, organizations, 
and researchers at both local and regional scales.  Collaborative efforts should focus on 
developing a guiding framework to address these primary issues (Williams & Price 
2002): 1) increasing communication among stakeholders; 2) increasing genetic research 
for the development of appropriate seed zones; 3) increasing information transfer 
regarding reliable methods for producing NPM; 4) finding the most effective methods to 
improve market stability; and 5) securing a stable funding mechanism for market 

80 
 
initiation and continued research and development.  Obtaining appropriate long-term 
funding may be the most critical factor to overcome to initiate a regional market.  
Two main investment structures could be used for market initiation within the 
region, a purely government funded approach, or a collaborative effort between 
government agencies and private entities.  The GB Project is strictly government funded 
and demand is primarily driven by multiple government agency needs.  The Project uses 
its funding to conduct extensive research on key native plant species.  The production 
information obtained together with a small quantity of seed stock is then provided to 
growers along with a buy-back option as a market incentive.  Only a minimal amount of 
seed is bought-back leaving the rest of the supply become available for sale on the open 
market. The cost estimate needed to initiate a market under this scenario is between $4.6 
and $6 million over a five-year period (GBRI 2001; Pellant 2006).  The UP Project 
exemplifies government and private funding.  Demand is driven by both private and 
public land NPM needs, with a focus on providing a local-source of seed for agency use.  
Major funding is secured through government agencies, and additional outside funding is 
obtained to provide financial support and buy-back options to local growers.  An 
estimated $2.4 million of government funding over a five-year period would be needed 
under this scenario (UP Project 2007).   
An entirely privately funded market initiation approach is most likely infeasible 
due to the substantial initial investment needed.  Based on survey results, the southern 
Colorado Plateau market is primarily driven by government needs.  This suggests that all, 
or at least half, of the funding should come from government agencies and primarily 
those responsible for burned area rehabilitation seeding activities.  

81 
 
Burned rehabilitation plays a central role in the demand for NPM in the southern 
Colorado Plateau.  A determination of how much seed is needed to meet post-fire seeding 
demands will be important to accurately assess the feasibility of market initiation.  We 
produced a theoretical example to determine an estimated annual budget for post-burn 
seeding efforts in the region.  Between 1990 and 2005 the USFS typically seeded ca. 
5,700 hectares per year (Wolfson & Sieg, in press).  Based upon our survey results of 
area seeded, we assume that the BLM seeds about the same area as the USFS, and that all 
other agencies combined seed about half this area.  Cumulatively we estimate that 
approximately 14,250 hectares are seeded annually in Arizona and New Mexico as part 
of burned rehabilitation efforts.  This would require an annual investment of $373,000 
from government agencies, and roughly 183 hectares of production area from seed 
companies (Table 3).  Assuming a 20% fluctuation between mild and severe fire seasons, 
between 11,400 and 17,000 hectares could require seeding in Arizona and New Mexico 
annually.  This would require between $297,000 and $444,000 annually from government 
agencies, and between 146 and 218 production hectares from seed companies.   
We based estimates on the average yield and maturity of production fields for the 
top eight grass species in demand (from survey results) in weighted-ranked order 
(varying weight given to species based on ranking order) and the burned hectares seeded 
per year (Wolfson & Sieg, in press) while assuming the average percent seed 
viability/species (85%-97%, Damon Winter, Granite Seed, personal communication), 
roughly a 50% discount to federal agencies that purchase native seed in bulk or through a 
competitive bidding process (Curtis et al. 2005), and an average wildfire seeding rate of 
600 pure live seeds per square meter (PLS/m2, Hunter et al. 2006).  The species used in 

82 
 
this scenario are not a recommended list of species but act as a single example for 
determining the financial investment needed based on a NPM market driven by fire 
rehabilitation efforts.  For rehabilitation efforts to be successful, using materials that are 
genetically diverse should be a priority.  Furthermore, this hypothetical example varies 
substantially from figures estimated from the GB and UP Project.  Because of this, a 
thorough economic analysis will be needed to determine actual market expenditures. 
Concerns over the effects increased disturbance will have on native plant 
communities (Huenneke 1991) underscores the importance of using both locally-adapted 
and genetically diverse plant materials to maintain the genetic integrity of ecosystems.  
Therefore, the development of any NPM market should not be viewed as a financial 
burden, but rather an ecological investment necessary for the future stability and 
adaptability of ecosystems’ native plant communities.  Although this paper is regionally 
focused, it builds on information gained from similar studies worldwide (Mortlock 1999; 
Burton & Burton 2002; Williams & Price 2002), and provides additional insight into 
issues and attitudes of those involved in a NPM industry.  There is reason to believe those 
involved in restoration as well as land managers will utilize our study to expand upon the 
findings we have presented here, in order to overcome challenges that may directly affect 
the development and continuation of the NPM industry worldwide.

CHAPTER FOUR 
Conclusions 
If the projections of increased fire activity in the western U.S. are correct, the need to 
revegetate disturbed lands, and more specifically those areas burned in high-severity 
wildfires, will undoubtedly escalate.  Across agencies, post-fire seeding treatments continue 
to be used as a first choice rehabilitation measure, although use of these treatments in 
achieving specified rehabilitation objectives remains debatable.  Apart from the use of 
seeding in post-wildfire rehabilitation, however, revegetation is an integral component of 
other land management practices such as invasive species management, livestock 
grazing, wildlife habitat management, roadside rehabilitation, mine reclamation, and 
recreational use.  The use of genetically-appropriate plant materials will be important as 
maintenance of genetic diversity is a vital mechanism by which plant communities can 
adapt and evolve to survive in a changing climate (Huenneke, 1991).   
Based on our results in Chapter 2, seeding can have both positive and negative 
effects on post-fire ecosystems.  In several studies seeding was shown to be effective in 
increasing plant cover to reduce soil erosion (Orr 1970; Anderson and Brooks 1975; 
Maloney and Thornton 1995); however, based on the quality of evidence criteria, only 
one of 12 studies reported in the two highest quality categories qualified seeding 
effectiveness for soil erosion.  In addition, 78% of study sites evaluating soil erosion 
showed that seeding provides no additional benefit in reducing erosion relative to 
unseeded controls. Furthermore, using total vegetation cover thresholds for soil erosion 
as a matrix for seeding treatment success, only one-seventh of the seeded sites supported 
sufficient cover to effectively prevent soil erosion. These results corroborate previous 
reviews suggesting that seeding often fails to reduce erosion (Beschta et al. 2004; Beyers 

99 
 
2004; Wolfson and Sieg, in press), especially not in the first critical years after fire 
(Kruse et al. 2004).  Mulching may be more effective in reducing soil erosion than 
seeding, but may inadvertently introducing non-native species (Keeley 2004).  Increased 
research investigating the effects and effectiveness of mulching will be important. 
Post-fire seeding treatments are often implemented to promote recovery of native 
plant communities over time.  However, across forested ecosystems, reviewed papers 
showed seeding to reduce (62%) and/or suppress (60%) recovery of native graminoids, 
forbs, and shrub and tree seedlings (Amaranthus et al. 1993; Schoennagel and Waller 
1999; Barclay et al. 2004).  Furthermore, seeded species had persistent effects on native 
vegetation beyond the first year or two after fire (Schoennagel and Waller 1999; Barclay 
et al. 2004; Stella 2009). This is a concern in that use of annual cereal grains and sterile 
hybrid grains has increased under the premise that these species disappear quickly.  
Although seeding with native species has increased, they are typically used in mixes with 
non-native species, and are rarely used by themselves.  Thus, studies examining the 
effects of seeding with 100% native species are extremely limited.  Increased research 
will be needed to determine the overall effectiveness and effects of seeding with native 
species. 
 
In recent years, the use of post-fire seeding to reduce non-native species invasion 
has increased, but studies quantifying the effectiveness of seeding treatments to curtail 
these invasions are limited.   The existing data show that seeding was only effective in 
reducing non-native species abundance about 50% of the time; of those treatments, the 
majority introduced additional negative impacts on native communities by seeding with 
non-native species.  Insufficient literature exists to determine whether seeding with 

100 
 
natives would be more effective.  More work is needed to determine the effectiveness of 
seeding with native species to reduce non-native invasions.  
 
The scientific literature and management documentation show that costly post-fire 
seeding does little to protect soil and promote plant recovery in the short-term but may 
introduce potentially negative effects with long-term ecological consequences.   Alternative 
actions for erosion control should be considered.  If seeding continues to be widely used, 
the use of locally-adapted, genetically-diverse plant materials will be important, although 
more research regarding the effects and effectiveness of these species is critical.  Lastly, 
rapid detection methods may allow better control for non-native species invasions. 
What does this mean for a native plant market based driven by post-fire seeding?  
If post-fire seeding treatments remain widely used, the demand for locally-adapted plant 
materials based on post-fire seeding needs may create the ideal opportunity for a market 
initiation.  Although a diverse approach will be needed to overcome the many challenges 
of initiating a native plant market in the southern Colorado Plateau, market models and 
funding options exist for development of plant materials based on these demands.   
If post-fire seeding treatments decline as a major post-fire rehabilitation practice, 
demand for locally-adapted plant materials will remain as revegetation is an integral 
component of other land management practices in the region including invasive species 
management, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat management, roadside rehabilitation, 
mine reclamation, and recreational use.  Based on our survey results, ecological 
restoration was the second largest driver of demands for locally-adapted plant materials.  
However, policy will ultimately drive overall agency decisions regarding the use and 

101 
 
purchase of native plant materials. Model markets could still be used as a template of 
how to overcome challenges of market initiation.    
Regardless of what is driving the demand for native plant materials, a market 
opportunity exists on the southern Colorado Plateau.  It is clear that for a market to be 
developed, an integrated collaborative strategy is needed among producers, land 
managers, government agencies, organizations, and researchers at both local and regional 
scales.  Collaborative efforts should focus on developing a guiding framework to address 
primary issues (Williams and Price 2002) regarding: 1) increasing communication among 
stakeholders; 2) increasing genetic research for the development of appropriate seed 
zones; 3) increasing information transfer regarding reliable methods for producing 
locally-adapted plant materials; 4) finding the most effective methods to improve market 
stability; and 5) securing a stable funding mechanism for market initiation and continued 
research and development.

Appendix III: Complete Survey Methodology 
 
Model Markets 
 
Through an investigation of current literature, interviews, and site visits we aimed to 
identify NPM markets in nearby regions which could be used as models to help guide the 
development of a regionally-based NPM market in the southern Colorado Plateau.  We 
searched scientific journals, unpublished theses and reports, and government documents 
to identify preliminary model markets.  We interviewed natural resource professionals 
within the region to gain further insight on the markets previously identified.  Final 
model markets were selected based on their similarity to the southern Colorado Plateau’s 
size and market demands.   
 
Survey 
 
We developed two distinct web-based surveys to assess current native plant market 
perceptions and the opportunity to initiate a native plant and seed industry in the southern 
Colorado Plateau.  Through an extensive interview and searching process, participants 
were identified.   Preliminary information gained from interviews helped guide survey 
question development.  Pre-testing allowed for assessment of survey question 
comprehension, efficiency, relevancy and format organization.  From pre-testing 
feedback the final surveys were created and administered by a web-based approach.  The 
techniques used to develop and administer the survey proved to be effective and yielded 
high response rates.  The information gained highlights key elements that may be needed 
to stimulate a native plant market.   
 
Sample of Demand and Supply Survey Respondents 
 
A demand survey was administered to a target group of individuals from federal, state, 
private, and nonprofit entities who were potentially or actively involved in restoration in 
the southern Colorado Plateau.  We administered a supply survey to a targeted group of 
individuals from both large and small-scale seed production companies from Arizona, 
New Mexico, nearby western and Great Plains states, as well as to other successful seed 
production companies.  In addition, individuals, identified through preliminary 
background interviews, who showed potential interest in initiating a native plant 
materials production company in the region, were added to the supply group sample.   
 
Question Development and Survey Construction 
 
To understand the context and design of a useful survey, a preliminary background 
investigation was conducted to determine current issues and trends pertaining to the use 
of native plant materials.  Interviews were conducted with natural resource managers 
from regional government agencies, private entities, and non-profit organizations, and 
private native plant landscaping and nursery owners in the southern Colorado Plateau.  
The preliminary information was used to help guide in the development of relevant 
survey questions.  After the content of the surveys was determined, preliminary supply 
and demand surveys were created.   

121 
 
 
The research operations manager of Northern Arizona University’s Social Research 
Laboratory (SRL) was consulted for the survey’s design and content.  This guided the use 
of proper survey language and clear, unambiguous and concise wording to help eliminate 
question bias and survey fluency.  Survey questions were grouped into appropriate 
context categories.  In order to conduct the study, an Initial Application for Research 
along with the survey instrument was submitted to the Institutional Review Board at 
Northern Arizona University.  The application was approved in October 2007. 
 
Once question order, content, and format were finalized, a web-based survey was 
programmed for both the supply and demand markets using SurveyMonkey 
(www.surveymonkey.com).  SurveyMonkey is an online survey tool which was selected 
for its ease of use and capability to create professional surveys.  
 
A web-based survey methodology was selected over traditional mail survey methods due 
to its capability for automatic verification and storage of survey responses using database 
technology as well as its ability to eliminate transcription errors (Andrews, Nonnecke, 
and Preece, 2003).  Data, exported into an Excel spreadsheet, can then be checked to 
eliminate programming errors.  This method eliminates unanswered questions by use of 
special features and reduces administration time and cost.  Use of question “skip logic” 
enabled the respondent to be redirected to a relevant question within the survey based on 
the previous response.  To alleviate questions from being skipped entirely, all questions 
were programmed so the respondent could not continue without answering a question.   
 
Survey Content 
 
We developed 42 questions for the demand survey and 37 questions for the supply survey 
based on preliminary information from interviews and current literature (Richards et al. 
1998; Soller 2003; Hooper 2003).   The average length of time to complete the survey 
was approximately 15-20 minutes.  Each survey began with an introduction page.  The 
purpose of an introduction page is to help establish a trusting relationship with the 
prospective respondent and encourage the respondent to complete the survey (Andrews, 
Nonnecke, and Preece, 2003).  The introduction of each survey included: (1) 
identification of the researcher, (2) explained the survey’s purpose, (3) explained how the 
results would be used, (4) guaranteed respondent confidentiality and anonymity and, and 
(5) explained the sampling methodology. 
 
We asked a series of survey questions within six thematic areas pertaining to NPM: 1) 
policy and regulation; 2) issues and concerns; 3) purchasing and expenditures; 4) future 
use and needs; 5) equipment and operations; and 6) collaboration and funding.  We 
created and administered finalized surveys online (Andrews et al. 2003; Kaplowitz et al. 
2004; Ryu et al. 2005).   
 
Each survey consisted of a variety of formats including close-ended, “select all that 
apply,” and open-ended questions.  Close-ended questions, where respondents selected an 
answer from a given list also included an “Other” category and, at times, a comment 

122 
 
section.  The “Other” category allowed the respondent to select an answer that was not on 
the predetermined list.  “Select all that apply” questions allowed for the survey 
participant to select multiple answer choices.  Open-ended questions were included to 
encourage the survey participant to expand on issues not fully addressed in a closed-
ended question format and enabled the responses to be assessed in a qualitative format. 
 
Participant memory recall is often limited when information being requested is too far in 
the past.  For this reason, questions where designed for the survey participant to recall 
information one year prior to the current year (2006).  For each question, a “Don’t 
Know” and “Decline to Answer” answer category was available to allow the respondent 
the choice not to answer a question.  Before exiting the survey, a short paragraph thanked 
survey respondents and explained how the survey results would be used and incentives 
award for their participation.   
 
A large body of literature exists about the role of incentives play and its effect on survey 
response rates.  There is overwhelming agreement among social scientists that incentives 
increase overall response rates (Ryu et al., 2005).  For this reason, a copy of the final 
feasibility study report and a chance to win a Starbucks Coffee Company donation was 
offered as an incentive to each survey participant.  Starbucks Coffee Company 
generously donated $100 worth of Starbucks coffee and merchandise to be used as an 
incentive to complete the survey.  Each survey participant was entered into a drawing for 
a chance to win the prize.   
 
Survey Pre-testing 
 
A total of two pre-tests, one paper version and one web-based version were completed 
prior to the administration of the finalized web-based surveys.  Prior to the development 
of web-based survey questions, draft paper-based survey questions were administered to 
the Northern Arizona Native Seed Alliance (NANSA) for feedback on survey content.  
Revisions were made according to NANSA feedback and a web-based survey was 
created.  Fifteen professionals were asked to complete the web-based supply and demand 
surveys as a pre-test.  This allowed for testing survey question comprehension, 
efficiency, relevancy and format organization.  Seven natural resource managers from the 
northern Arizona region and three NAU researchers familiar with native plant material 
practices were selected to pre-test the demand survey.  Three government agency 
personnel directly involved in purchasing or housing seed for restoration practices and 
two representatives from native plant material production companies located in Arizona 
were selected to pre-test the supply survey.  Of the 15 survey pre-test participants, three 
individuals were included in the final sample database as they were major entities in the 
demand for native plant materials.   
 
Prior to administering the web-based pre-test surveys, each potential survey pre-test 
recipient was contacted by telephone to explain the purpose of the survey and to gain 
consent to complete the survey.  It has been demonstrated that pre-notification contact 
has the strongest response rate impact (Kaplowitz et al., 2004).  Upon gaining approval to 
take the survey, the pre-test group was sent a personalized email with instructions on how 

123 
 
to complete the survey as well as the survey link.  A unique identifying number was 
assigned to each survey pre-test respondent.  This created a coded survey link which 
allowed survey responses to be associated with the respondents’ contact information.   
 
All survey pre-test respondents were given approximately two weeks to complete to the 
survey.  A follow-up email was sent one week into the survey response period to those 
respondents who had not yet submitted their survey.  Studies have shown that a follow-up 
email often has a positive effect on response rates (Andrews, Nonnecke, and Preece, 
2003).  At the end of the two week survey response period, eight out of ten demand 
surveys were completed (80% response rate) and three out of five supply surveys were 
returned (60% response rate).  All responses and feedback from the pre-test group were 
evaluated and surveys were amended to reflect relevant recommendations from this 
group.    
 
Survey Distribution 
 
The survey sample database files were finalized with a total of 42 demand and 39 supply 
contacts (Appendix II).  An attempt was made to contact each potential survey participant 
directly by telephone prior to sending the final survey link.  Pre-notification explained the 
purpose of the survey, how the results would be used, and to gain approval to participate.  
Of the 42 demand participants, 31 could be reached on the telephone and agreed to take 
the survey.  Of the 39 supply contacts, 27 could be reached directly on the telephone and 
agreed to participate in the study.  For the remaining 11demand participants and the 12 
supply participants who could not be reached, messages were left on answering machines 
or with other associates.  All potential survey participants, including those not reached 
directly on the telephone, were sent their relevant surveys to allow for participation and 
increase response rates.  Survey links were embedded into personalized emails as well as 
instructions on how to successfully complete the survey, a deadline date, and an 
explanation of the Starbucks prize which was used as an incentive to complete the 
survey.  All survey participants were given approximately two weeks to respond to the 
survey.  A unique identifying number was assigned to each survey participant.  This 
identifying number allowed survey responses to be associated with the respondents’ 
contact information.  Additionally, the identifying number allowed for follow-up of 
ambiguous answers.   Consequently, survey responses remained confidential and 
anonymous and were reported as an aggregate.   
 
A reminder email with each coded survey link and a deadline date reminder was sent one 
week into the survey response period to those respondents who had not yet completed the 
survey.  At the end of the first survey response period, 29 returned a complete demand 
survey (69% response rate) and 25 completed the supply survey (64% response rate).   
Participants who had not yet responded to the surveys after the two week response period 
were contacted again.  A total of 13 demand and 14 supply contacts were called directly 
by telephone.  The survey administration method previously used was followed again.  At 
the end of the second week response period the demand survey gained eight additional 
completed surveys and increased the response rate to 88% (37 responses total).  The 
supply survey gained four respondents, increasing the response rate to 85% (33 responses 

124 
 
total).  Contact by telephone prior to sending the surveys, personalized emails, follow-up 
contact, and an incentive led to a high response rate.  Applying these tactics increase 
response rates, augments the validity and reliability of the survey data, and the resulting 
research conclusions. 
 
Analysis of Survey Results 
 
We used Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (SPSS 2007) to 
analyze final survey response datasets.  Survey questions were analyzed by calculating 
answer frequencies (n) and valid percents of respondent participation for each question.  
For respondents answering “Don’t Know” and “Decline to Answer,” those responses 
were counted as missing and were not included in the valid percent calculations.  For 
multiple choice questions stating “Select all that apply,” total percent may exceed 100, as 
respondents could answer multiple times.  Valid percents, in these cases, were calculated 
by dividing the total response for each category by the total number of responses for that 
question.  Percents were rounded which may cause total percents to be slightly greater or 
less than 100. 
 
Answers within a “comment” or “other” response were tabulated and analyzed.  
Responses fitting into the original question categories were recoded accordingly and 
included in final valid percent and frequency results.  For ease of the analysis, open-
ended and other responses were summarized.  For question where open and other 
responses that were repetitive are listed below the corresponding question and delineated 
with the number of duplicate responses in parenthesis.  Questions and corresponding 
results are discussed in the survey results section and summarized in an Annotated 
Questionnaire format (Appendix IV).

Appendix IV: Annotated Questionnaire - Demand 
 
A total of 42 questions were administered to 37 consumers of native seed in the Northern 
Arizona Native Plant Materials Market Feasibility Survey.  Answer frequencies (n) and 
valid percents of survey results for each question are summarized in an Annotated 
Questionnaire below. 
 
In cases where respondents answered “Don’t Know” and “Decline to Answer,” these 
responses were counted as “missing” and were omitted in calculating valid percent. In 
addition, valid percents were rounded which may cause total percents to equal slightly 
more or less than 100.  For the multiple response questions, where respondents were able 
to select more than one answer, the total n may be higher than the number of respondents. 
In these cases, valid percents were calculated by the number (n) in each response 
category divided by the total number of responses for the question.  Where respondent 
answers were identical in the open response questions/sections, the total (n) duplicated 
responses are represented in parenthesis after the stated response.  See Appendix V for a 
full list of scientific names and authorities used in this questionnaire.

2. This would be preferred for post-fire seeding; most likely Burned Area Emergency 
    Rehabilitation rather than National Park Service would be purchasing this seed. 
3. It depends on too many factors to have a simple answer. 
4. Again, it depends on the relevance of the species to that area 
5. Depends on the state of the "ecosystem"

Comments Q39: 
1. As a federal agency, we are not allowed to do so...but will support in other ways. 
2. If they produce the seed we need when we need it. 
3. Contracting and procurement policy would limit long-term contracts 
4. Would depend on the project and duration 
5. Many factors to consider here 
 
Q40. Are there any general comments that you would like to add regarding the topics of 
this survey? 
 
1. We are an interstate natural gas transmission company which adheres to federal, state 
and local regulations pertaining to reseeding and restoration 
2. We do not use large quantities of seed like those amounts necessary for large seedling 
project.  We produce plants/seedlings for research, wildlife habitat improvement, and 
fire rehabilitation/restoration projects.  A lot of our propagation is also from cuttings.  
We have produced over 250,000 plants which have been put into the field over the 
last 3 years.  Almost 50,000 Fremont cottonwoods and native willows in the last two 
years strictly from cuttings.  Besides seed local gardens which hold different 
genotypes of Fremont cottonwood and willows would be useful as a source for 
cuttings.  Local gardens with different local genotypes of aspen would also be useful 
for cuttings for future project. 
3. Seed pound/cost only an estimate 
4. Before the market is developed, there needs to be a concerted effort to determine the 
feasibility of planting the various native seeds through existing equipment as well as 
what the seeding and germination requirements of the species are. For example there 
seems to be very little information on how deep Needle and Thread grass seeds need  
to be seeded not to mention how breaking the awns off the seed (as is currently done0 
during processing affects it's ability to germinate. Not to mention if it can be 
effectively seeded in combination with other seed with different requirements. Other 
unanswered questions are how to effectively seed into established mediterranean 
annual stands. Until we can understand some of these issues, we will waste most of 
our time and money trying. 
5. I am sure your results will underscore the NEED for more native plant material 
production.  How will you use the results??? 
6. Our new seed collector is new and untested. We are not sure how the whole process 
will work from harvesting to processing to storage.  So, this is a big unknown factor 
on how much seed we will need from out-side sources. 
7. My answers are only relevant to Hart Prairie Preserve, not the entire Nature 
Conservancy. 
8. Our work is mainly on the lower Colorado River; however the seed companies that 
we obtain seed from are in San Diego and Utah. It would be great to have a local 
grower. Some seed is hard to propagate in field conditions and the plants are better 
planted as plugs. 
9. NRCS has a plant materials program that is developing native plant species for use in 
the region.  We would like to see these better utilized by growers for use in their 
adapted ranges. 

153 
 
10. Development of seed sources of regional ecotypes of native species is critical for use 
post-fire, for revegetation, for weed and erosion control and for general revegetation 
needs.  Thanks for working on this project. 
11. We will utilize local native seed whenever possible.  If we had a reliable source, and 
costs, quality, supply, etc were conducive to our procurement regulations, we would 
utilize local sources as a priority. 
12. Most of our activities have been in southern Arizona or along the Central Arizona 
Project alignment through Sonoran desert biome 
13. Is there a separation between small scale and large scale markets? 
14. Because the topic of this survey is so complicated, having a comment section 
associated each question would be helpful.  That way you could explain "yes" or "no" 
if needed. 
15. There needs to be a local outlet to be available to us here in Northern Arizona, 
possible in Flagstaff. 
16. I cannot speak for my agency as a whole.  I can only answer questions that relate to 
my direct experience including as few fire rehabilitation projects (BAER). I cannot 
address the willingness of the Forest Service to enter into long-term contracts 
17. We did have a seedling program for a number of years. It was disbanded and I am not 
aware of any plans for us to reinstate any of these programs.

Appendix IV: Annotated Questionnaire - Supply 
 
A total of 37 questions were administered to 33 suppliers of native seed in the Native 
Plant Materials Market Feasibility Survey.  Answer frequencies (n) and valid percents of 
survey results for each question are summarized in an Annotated Questionnaire below. 
 
In cases where respondents answered “Don’t Know” and “Decline to Answer,” these 
responses were counted as “missing” and were omitted in calculating valid percent. In 
addition, valid percents were rounded which may cause total percents to equal slightly 
more or less than 100.  For the multiple response questions, where respondents were able 
to select more than one answer, the total n may be higher than the number of respondents. 
In these cases, valid percents were calculated by the number (n) in each response 
category divided by the total number of responses for the question.  Where respondent 
answers where duplicated in the open response questions/sections, the total (n) duplicated 
responses is represented in parenthesis after the stated response.  See Appendix V for a 
full list of scientific names and authorities used in this questionnaire.

Comments Q2: 
1. Problems using local genotype plants or seeds that we run into is that they don't fit a 
    large enough area and you can run into collectors charging huge prices if the demand is 
    great. There is never enough of the types that you are looking for to seed large areas 
    and it takes along time to grow enough to be of use.  We run into this problem all the 
    time.   The best approach is to have the plant materials centers select viable varieties 
    that fit larger areas.  A lot of the times the local genotype varieties have a difficult time 
    become established and competing. 
2. The variability of fire makes difficult to inventory quantities of local genotypes that 
    may or may not be sold. 
3. The majority of our seed sales not influenced by local genotype 
4. It is not always practical.  There is a chicken and egg problem with localized material. 
5. Very important for woody species (as required by federal law); very important for 
    forbs 
6. The answer to this question can vary dramatically from species to species. In other 
    words, some species are more adaptable than others. 
7. It is important to us if it is important to our customers 
8. It is dependent upon customer requests - we sell a lot of native grass seeds for 
    reclamation and maintenance. 
 
 
Q3. Is there a current market to sell local genotype plants and seeds that will be used for 
large-scale restoration projects (25 acres or more)?

Comments Q3: 
1. In some places 
2. The problem is that we can't get good seed stock to grow enough seed to fit any project 
    of any size quick enough.   Example is if you have a project that required a collected 
    variety.  The cost at the time of bid was $100.00 per pls lb.  By the time the project 
    was seeded the price had gone up to $1,000.00 per Pure Live Seed pound because of 
    the weather and availability of the seed and the person who had tied up all the seed and  
    raised the price.   If it is not available in the commercial market place by many players 
    the price of the seed will be huge 
3. A very small market 
4. Very limited 
5. Yes, along the Sierra front where most of my business is. 
6. Hard to answer, both yes and no, unpredictable. 
7. This depends on the species and is typically more true for seed 
8. As long as the production is kept private. 
9. It varies depending on the location of the restoration project and the adaptability of the 
    species being replaced. If widely adapted species are being replaced then the 
    importance of using locally adapted species diminishes. 
10. There may be on occasion but enough to create a stable market. 
11. In my opinion this is beginning to grow to the size of large scale.

Other responses Q12: 
1. You should have “All of the Above”, if you are talking about local genotype or all 
    native seeds.  It makes a great deal of difference.  Local genotype is a huge amount of 
    time and labor finding varieties that you can grow. It is extremely expensive and time 
    consuming. 
2. Weed control 
3. For the past few years it would be available land for production.  Currently, the price 
    of wheat and corn, have impacted the available acres for production of native species. 
4. Reliable seed production of native seed species. Private increase of native seed species 
    is unreliable and varies too dramatically to make it financially worth-while. Native  
    collection of locally adapted species is more reliable and cost effective.

1. Please explain what that statement means.  By Federal standards it means Noxious 
    Weed Free for the State where it is going.  Some people believe that it means there are 
    no noxious weeds, but by regulation it is something else.  I talk to so many people that 
    don't have a clue what that statement means. 
2. We haven't decided to do so 
3. All of the above 
4. Most noxious weeds are NOT a problem in restorations, most are only problems in 
    traditional agriculture. I have many more concerns with other crops such as Sweet 
    Clover and CrownVetch

Q35. Are there any general comments that you would like to add regarding the topics of 
this survey? 
 
1. Going through your questions, I can't think of all the problems that we have run into 
    with regard to native seed.  You talk about 25 acre areas, what about when you have 
    wildfires, floods, or other major events.  How do you provide the genotype for the area 
    to cover these events, and if you plant seed from outside the area that you are talking 
    about don't you contaminate what you are trying to accomplish.  There is no way a 
    present where you can grow enough genotype seed to fit all the needs out there. As 
    each region wants more and more species only the cost is going to put all out of reach 
    for any project.   I would have to see genotype and other native species of the same 
    type planted in test plots side by side in every area that shows planting genotypes 
    grown only within a small local area are better.   And I haven't seen it done yet 
2. For me, it seems geared for larger operators, not small timers like myself doing this 
    mostly for xeriscaping of small properties. 
3. Location of each person answering the survey will make a big difference on the kind of 
    native business they do.  For example land managers in low precip zones are happy 
    when anything, native or not, grows.  Where a land manager in a high precip Zone >14 
    inches has the luxury of being selective as there are far more species to choose from in 
    that location.

4. It is a little difficult to decide what the top sellers will be since it depends on what area 
    you are talking about. Restoration projects tend to be very species specific and changes 
    for each location. Our success has come from trying to educate the public and we deal 
    more with individuals than agencies. 
5. Species supply and demand are highly volatile and change monthly 
6. Market dynamics/volatility defy rational decision making. 
7. I would recommend you review the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) purchases 
    over the previous 5 years.  Using that information you could get an excellent idea of 
    which species are in demand.  Visit www.fedbizops.gov for that info or contact the  
    BLM out of Boise, Idaho. 
8. Many of the questions did not apply to my small business. Though a high percentage 
    of my seeds are from native plants, my customers are wholesale nursery growers for 
    the landscape & retail nursery trades. I've worked to encourage the use of true native 
    material, rather than merely drought tolerant exotics, in the urban landscape. 
9. The most difficult aspect of supplying locally adapted species for our business is the 
    red tape and long delays related to the governing land agencies and the ability of the 
    seed purchaser to acquire funds. For example, the long drawn out process of the federal 
    agencies procuring money often outlasts the plants growing season and the plants often 
    blossom, produce seed and then shed their production before the agencies can get  
    funding in place. This often delays the agency’s ability to purchase seed until the 
    following season and the seed needs to go on the ground now. The fact that federal  
    agencies work on a fiscal year system that does not coincide with the growing/harvest 
    season does not help, either. Another problem is the following example: the Fish and 
    Game needs seed to plant a recent fire. The closest locally adapted seed stand is 
    located just over the next ridge from the planting site but is growing on US Forest 
    Service (USFS) land and the USFS won’t let you collect seed in that area. 
10. We are a small non-profit foundation and we do not do large scale projects. 
11. As I stated in my answers, the selection of the seeds and plants that will be in demand 
      are very customer and site specific. We feel that there is not one grass or plant that 
      works well in all locations and situations. Another thing to take into consideration is 
      the constant development of new viable types of native plants that are being 
      researched and will be available in the next 5-10 years. 
12. Most of the questions on this survey do not fit our company.  We distribute 
      wildflower seeds, some of which are native types -- we do not offer specific  
      eco-types, seed grown in certain areas, do native collection.  Seed native to the United 
      States is not just grown in the United States.  Your survey is more suited to  
      companies that grow in their location for application in their region or are involved in 
      hand collection. 
13. If there is a market then you can damn well bet there will be someone there to 
      produce what is needed.
