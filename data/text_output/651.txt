Highlight 
For study of the effecf of frees on 
undersfory 
vegetation 
a good math- 
ematical 
equation 
is very 
helpful. 
This 
article 
presenis 
an 
equation 
which fits oversfory-undersfory 
data 
better 
than 
previously 
used 
equa- 
iions. 
Trees 
adversely 
affect 
the 
growth 
of herbaceous 
plants 
around them; clearings 
in a for- 
est produce 
much more herbace- 
ous material 
than 
do similar 
areas with 
a dense 
tree cover. 
Because of competition 
for light, 
water, 
and nutrients, 
and pos- 
sible antagonistic 
chemical 
ef- 
fects, this inverse relationship 
is 
entirely reasonable 
and has often 
been reported 
in the literature. 
A few examples 
are the ponde- 
rosa pine 
(Pinus 
ponderosaJ2 
ranges 
of South 
Dakota 
(Pase, 
1958)) Oregon 
(McConnell 
and 
Smith, 1965)) and Arizona 
(Rey- 
nolds, 
1962; 
Pearson, 
1964) ; 
southern 
pine ranges 
(Gaines et 
al., 1954; Halls 
and Schuster,

areas in Mis- 
souri (Ehrenreich 
and Crosby, 
1960) ; and chaparral 
and wood- 
land 
ranges 
of Arizona 
(Pond, 
1961; Arnold 
et al., 1964). Math- 
ematical 
expressions 
of the rela- 
tionship 
between 
trees and the 
herbaceous 
understory 
do not 
point out the basic causes of the 
relationship; 
nevertheless, 
they 
have many useful applications. 
Several 
investigators 
have 
fitted 
regression 
lines 
to their 
data. 
The 
measurement 
of 
trees is taken as the independent 
variable 
(x) 
and the measure- 
ment of herbage 
as the depend- 
ent variable 
(y) . The relation- 
ship between 
these variables 
is 
clearly 
curvilinear, 
and mathe- 
matical 
models 
published 
in- 
clude log y = a + bx, y = a + b 
log (x+l),andy=a+bx+ 
cx2. The model 
y = 
a + b log 
(Kx + 1) has also been suggested 
(Batschelet, 
1966). Other models 
could also be fitted; for example, 
y = a + bx + cx2 + dx3 gives a 
good fit in some cases. 
All of these models were tried 
with three sets of Arizona 
data, 
and none were satisfactory. 
The 
simpler models generally 
gave a 
poor fit with the data, especially 
as x approached 
zero. The poly- 
nomial 
models 
were illogical, 
a 
fact which 
became 
very 
appar- 
ent as the computed 
lines were 
extended 
beyond 
the limits 
of 
the data. 
Recently, 
Grosenbaugh 
(1965) 
included 
as one of several 
gen- 
eralized 
growth 
functions 
a 5- 
parameter 
transition 
sigmoid 
growth 
curve given by 
where X is the independent 
vari- 
able, Y is the estimated value of 
the dependent 
variable, 
and H 
and A are the upper and lower 
asymptotes, 
respectively. 
B pro- 
vides the necessary curvature, 
M 
adjusts the inflection 
point, and 
G adjusts the value of X so that 
X- 
G = 0 when Y = H. 
For overstory-understory 
rela- 
tionships, 
the X origin 
may be 
taken as zero so that G = 0. Also 
the sigmoid shape (M > 0) may 
not be necessary, 
so that values 
of M > -1 were allowed, 
that is, 
(M + 1) > 0. For 0 < (M + 1) 
< 
1 the inflection 
point 
has a 
negative 
abscissa value, and the 
curves 
are concave 
upward 
in 
the first quadrant. 
Three 
sets of data were used 
for computation. 
The collection 
of two of the sets was described 
by Pearson 
(1964). 
These 
data, 
were 
collected 
in a ponderosa 
pine forest in northern 
Arizona. 
Basal area of trees was measured 
with a lo-factor 
prism using the 
plotless 
“Bitterlich” 
method 
(Grosenbaugh, 
1952). Basal area 
ranged 
from 
10 ft2 through 
200 
ft2/acre. 
Tree canopy 
cover was 
also measured at each point with 
a canopy 
mirror 
(Lemmon, 
1956). In addition, 30 points were 
taken 
at random 
in a cleared 
area. At each point all herbace- 
ous vegetation 
from a 9.6-ft2 cir- 
cular plot was clipped to ground 
level, ovendried 
at 104 C for 48

hr, and weighed. About 36% of 
the weight of the herbaceous ma- 
terial was made up of Arizona 
fescue (Festuca arizonica) 
and 
49% of mountain muhly (Muh- 
Zenbergia montana). The remain- 
ing 15% included 4 species of 
grass, 1 sedge, and some 40 forbs.

The results of these clippings 
were first averaged 
for each 
basal area class, and expressed 
as total pounds of herbage per 
acre. The data were then re- 
grouped by canopy classes, and 
the average herbage weights for 
each class were determined for 
the second set of data. 
IOO- 
The third set of data was from 
Arnold et al. (1964). These data 
were collected at 14 locations in 
the pinyon-juniper 
(Pinus 
edu- 
Zis, Juniperus spp.) type in north- 
ern and central Arizona. A total 
of 220 50-ft transects were mea- 
sured. Tree cover was measured 
with the line intercept technique 
of Canfield (1941). Herbage sam- 
ples were obtained by clipping a 
4-inch strip along each transect. 
Important herbaceous species in- 
cluded blue grama (Bouteloua 
gracilis) and herbaceous portions 
of snakeweed (Gutierrexia 
saro- 
the.) 
The results of these clip- 
pings were grouped by cover 
classes, and 
means 
of 
each 
canopy class were calculated.

A computer program3 was de- 
signed to approximate values of 
B and M + 1 in the equation by 
iteration, and solve for H and A 
in the usual least squares pro- 
cedure for regression equations. 
For the three sets of data, the 
best fit, with the equations, is 
shown in Fig. 1. The curve for 
pine basal area (Fig. 1A) was the 
only one that was sigmoid. 
When X = 0 the maximum 
departure of Y from the actual 
plot values was 9 lb/acre, and 
the curve fit the data well along 
the rest of the lines. Since the
