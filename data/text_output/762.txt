Abstract
Snags are important components of wildlife habitat, providing nesting and feeding sites for over 75 species of animals in the
southwestern United States. Wildﬁres can increase or decrease the availability of snags to wildlife by killing live trees or
incinerating snags. Our objectives were to describe dynamics and spatial patterns of ﬁre-killed snags in ponderosa pine (Pinus
ponderosa) forests of northern Arizona and predict the probability of snag use by cavity nesters. We established six 1-ha plots
following two recent ﬁres that occurred in northern Arizona (Hochderffer ﬁre of 1996 [H96] and Pumpkin ﬁre of 2000 [P00]) to
determine ponderosa pine snag availability and use by wildlife as evidenced by presence of excavated cavities. For comparison,
six paired 1-ha plots in nearby unburned areas were sampled with burned plots. For the twelve 1 ha plots, ﬁeld methods included
mapping and measuring 15 characteristics for 668 snags (630 in burned and 38 in unburned plots) 4 years post-ﬁre on the H96
ﬁre, and 1010 snags (996 in burned and 14 in unburned plots) 1 year post-ﬁre on the P00 ﬁre. We remeasured characteristics of all
snags in 2003. Most burned snags were standing 3 years after ﬁre, but 7 years after ﬁre, 41% had fallen. Snags in burned plots
were clumped when initially measured and remeasured. After 7 years, snags in burned plots that were still standing were straight,
large diameter trees in denser clumps. Density of excavated cavities was similar between burned (3.0 ha1) and unburned
(2.2 ha1) plots, even though burned areas produced much higher densities of snags. Snags (both burned and unburned) that were
most likely to contain excavated cavities were large diameter with broken tops. This evidence of cavity nester use indicates that
in ponderosa pine forests in the southwest, retaining large diameter snags is important to cavity nesters regardless of snag origin.
If salvage logging is to occur in severely burned ponderosa pine in the southwest, retaining straight, large diameter snags in
clumps will help maintain snags for cavity-excavating species.

1. Introduction
Snags provide nesting, roosting, feeding, loaﬁng,
and storage sites for many wildlife species in the
southwest (Scott, 1979; Cunningham et al., 1980; Rabe
et al., 1998). In Arizona and New Mexico, ponderosa

pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests cover about 3.2 million
ha (Klemmedson and Smith, 1979) and provide nesting
habitat for more cavity-nesting species than any other
forest type (Scott and Patton, 1989). Prior to 1870, tree
densities were thought to average 60 ha1, with
forests experiencing low intensity but high frequency
(e.g., every 4 years) ﬁres. However, ﬁre suppression,
logging, and increases in livestock grazing have altered
ponderosa pine forest structure and composition over
the past century (Cooper, 1960; Cochran and Hopkins,
1991; Covington and Moore, 1994; Saab et al., 1995;
Touchan et al., 1996; Grissino-Mayer and Swetnam,
2000). In many areas, density of live trees has increased
(e.g., to >3000 trees ha1 today) and average diameter
of live trees has decreased (Covington et al., 1994; Mast
et al., 1999). As a consequence, wildﬁres in forests of
the southwest have been increasing in size and severity,
particularly in the last 25 years (Swetnam and Baisan,
2003).
Wildﬁres vary in intensity across a landscape and
can have both immediate and long-term impacts on
snags and snag dynamics (decay and fall rate). Low
intensity ﬁres may have little effect on live trees, but
may scorch and in some cases, incinerate snags
(Gaines et al., 1958; Horton and Mannan, 1988;
Boucher et al., 1999). Moderate and high intensity
ﬁres may scorch and kill live trees and incinerate snags
(Harrington, 1996; McHugh and Kolb, 2003). Fires
can therefore affect rates of snag formation, snag
density, and distribution among snag size classes. In
addition, ﬁre may affect snags by charring boles.
Charred snags may decay at slower rates than
unburned snags, be more difﬁcult to excavate for
some cavity nesting species, and therefore may be less
useful as a nesting resource (Gaines et al., 1958).
Many factors can inﬂuence wildlife use of snags,
including tree species, diameter, height, density, and
spatial dispersion. Most wildlife species select large
diameter snags (34 cm diameter at breast height
[dbh] in ponderosa pine) (Scott and Oldemeyer, 1983;
Rabe et al., 1998; Saab and Dudley, 1998; Lehmkuhl
et al., 2003; Ganey and Vojta, 2004). Less is known
about selection for other characteristics. Fire alters
characteristics of snags and likely affects use by cavity
nesters (Saab and Dudley, 1998). Knowing which
snags will remain standing longest and are most used
by cavity nesters can provide guidance in snag
management.
We documented ponderosa pine snag dynamics in
northern Arizona from 1 to 7 years following two
wildﬁres that occurred in 1996 and 2000. For each
snag, we determined year of origin as live tree, year
the tree died and became a snag, physical character-
istics (e.g., height, diameter, decay condition, spatial
arrangement), and wildlife use (signs of foraging,
presence of excavated cavities). Our objectives were
to (1) describe characteristics, spatial patterns, density,
decay rates, and dynamics of ﬁre-killed snags in
ponderosa pine forests of northern Arizona, and (2)
predict the probability of ﬁre-killed snag use by cavity
nesters based on snag characteristics.
2. Methods
2.1. Study sites
We selected two areas that had been recently
burned by wildﬁre on the Coconino and Kaibab
National Forests (NFs) located in northern Arizona,
approximately 26 km northwest of Flagstaff, Arizona.
These areas have a mean annual air temperature of 5–
6 8C and a mean annual precipitation of 500–600 mm.
A drought that occurs seasonally between April and
June (Anonymous, 1995) increases probability of ﬁre
during that time. The Hochderffer ﬁre (H96) burned
about 6500 ha of ponderosa pine on the Coconino NF
in June–July 1996. The Pumpkin ﬁre (P00) burned
about 5300 ha on the Coconino and Kaibab NFs in
May–June 2000. Both ﬁres varied in severity from low
(surface) to severe (crown).
To evaluate snag dynamics, we compared snags in
severely burned and unburned areas. Selected sites
had: (1) high severity burn patches (>95% of trees
killed by ﬁre) with nearby or adjacent unburned
patches, (2) >1 km between plot pairs, (3) similar
terrain, elevation, and pre-ﬁre tree densities, (4)
unburned snag densities of 5 snags ha1 (based on
Ganey (1999) median snag density of 5 snags ha1 in
unburned ponderosa pine forest in northern Arizona),
and (5) a range of snag diameter classes to determine
effect of diameter on decay and fall rate. Sites were
randomly chosen from those meeting the criteria. Plots
were paired, with one plot in ponderosa pine burned by
wildﬁre and the second plot located in unburned forest
<0.8 km from its pair. We placed three pairs of plots in
C.L. Chambers, J.N. Mast / Forest Ecology and Management 216 (2005) 227–240
228

each of the two wildﬁre-burned areas for a total of
twelve 1-ha plots. Distance between H96 and P00 ﬁres
was >10 km, and within a ﬁre boundary, pairs were
1.2–3.9 km
apart.
Plots
in
the
H96
ﬁre
were
established in 2000 (4 years post-ﬁre); whereas those
in the P00 ﬁre were established in 2001 (1 year post-
ﬁre). Because the wildﬁres were selected opportunis-
tically, the post-ﬁre monitoring periods for the two
ﬁres were not the same.
All snags and live trees in plots were ponderosa pine.
Plots were on relatively ﬂat slopes (9  1% standard
error [S.E.]), at elevations between 2300 and 2550 m,
with pre-ﬁre tree basalarea of 30  2 m2 ha1. Average
diameter of smallest snags in all plots was 17  2 cm;
largest snags averaged 67  4 cm.
2.2. Snag measurements
We sampled all snags >1.8 m in height and
>10 cm dbh on rectangular 50 m  200 m (1 ha)
permanent plots. Snag locations were mapped (to the
nearest 0.5 m) for spatial analysis and to assist
relocation in subsequent measurements. We collected
baseline data for all snags on the H96 ﬁre 4 years post-
ﬁre (2000) and on the P00 ﬁre 1 year post-ﬁre (2001).
As baseline data, we recorded the following for each
snag: dbh (taken at 1.4 m above ground), height
(measured with a clinometer), top condition (intact or
broken), bark cover (percent of bole with bark cover,
to the nearest 5%), char (percent of bole with burn, to
the nearest 5%), number of excavated cavities
(circular openings large and deep enough to appear
to the observer on the ground as adequate for the
smallest cavity nester in the area to use as a nest site),
number of natural cavities (naturally created openings
of adequate size for nesting), foraging sign (irregular
openings created by cavity-nesting birds on the
surface of the snag; recorded as present, absent),
dead limbs (number of dead limbs >10 cm diameter
and >30 cm length), lean (degrees) of the snag from
perpendicular to ground using a clinometer, and decay
class (Table 1). We measured slope (%) by taking two
measurements from each snag to 20 m distant in two
opposite directions and averaged measurements for
the snag, aspect (degrees) of slope on which the snag
stood by using the natural line of travel that water
would follow, and basal area (using a 20 BAF prism)
of live and dead trees surrounding each snag.
All snags were remeasured in 2003. All indepen-
dent variables except dbh, char, slope, and aspect were
remeasured. In addition, we assessed standing con-
dition to categorize snags as either standing, fallen
(uprooted or broken), cut, or missing (i.e., under other
fallen snags thus unable to relocate the snag). We
categorized snags into four dbh class (<25, 25–50.9,
51–75.9, 76 cm) for comparison with other studies
of ﬁre-killed ponderosa pine (Keen, 1929; Dahms,
1949; Bull, 1983; Everett et al., 1999) but combined
the two largest size classes because our sample size for
76 cm dbh snags was small (n = 2).
2.3. Dendrochronological methods
We collected two tree core samples near the ground
from all snags (unless they were too decayed) when
we collected baseline data on snag characteristics.
Tree cores were mounted, sanded, and crossdated
following standard dendrochronological procedures
(Stokes and Smiley, 1968) to determine age and year
of death (Mast and Veblen, 1994). Rings were counted
using a binocular microscope to determine marker
years which are annual rings with very narrow ring
widths or signatures (Visser, 1995). Ring counts were
corrected for false and missing rings by use of marker
years.
2.4. Data analysis
We described snag baseline (Time 0) and remea-
surement (Time 1) data using means and standard
errors. For the H96 ﬁre, Time 0 was 4 years post-ﬁre;
Time 1 was 7 years post-ﬁre. For the P00 ﬁre, Time 0
was 1 year post-ﬁre; Time 1 was 3 years post-ﬁre. We
used x2 tests for independence to test the null
hypotheses that there were no differences between
burned
and
unburned
snag
populations

condition, foraging sign, and decay class (Sokal and
Rohlf, 1981: 152). We used Wilcoxon two-sample tests
to test the null hypotheses that therewere no differences
betweenburnedandunburnedsnagpopulationsfordbh,
height, bark cover, char, number of excavated and
natural cavities, number of dead limbs, slope, and basal
area surrounding snag (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981: 433).
These comparisons were stratiﬁed by ﬁre (H96 versus
P00). We compared changes in characteristics of
standing snags across time using Wilcoxon signed rank
tests (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981: 449) to test the null
hypotheses that there were no differences between
Times 0 and 1 in height, bark cover, number of
excavated and natural cavities, number of dead limbs,
and basal area. We compared changes in conditionof all
snags (standing [standing or leaning] versus not
standing [fallen, cut, or missing]) and in proportions
of standing snags with broken tops, decay class, or
foraging sign across time using McNemar tests for
signiﬁcance of changes (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981: 768) to
test the null hypotheses that there were no differences
between Times 0 and 1. We used an alpha level of 0.05
for all tests.
We used logistic regression to identify character-
istics of burned and unburned snags that were
associated with excavated cavities. Because our sample
size of snags with excavated cavities was small
(n = 31), but about equal between burn types (n = 18
on burned plots, n = 13 on unburned plots) we
combined all snags with excavated cavities for analysis.
We used a randomly selected subset of snags without
cavities (n = 59, 29 unburned and 30 burned snags) for
comparison.We alsousedlogisticregressionasa means
of selecting variables that separated standing from
fallen snags at Time 1. We used the Hosmer and
Lemeshow goodness-of-ﬁt test to determine whether
the distribution of probabilities produced by our model
ﬁt the logistic probability distribution (Hosmer and
Lemeshow, 1989).
2.5. Spatial statistical analyses
We used spatial statistical tests to determine within
and between patch patterns. Patches were 1–20 m
diameter clumps around snags that increased in 1 m
diameter increments. Ripley’s K(t) was used to
determine snag pattern with clumped distributions
indicated by high values of K(t), random pattern
indicated by values within the conﬁdence intervals,
and dispersed (or uniform) distributions indicated by
low values (Ripley, 1977, 1981; Diggle, 1983).
Ripley’s
K12(t)
was
used
to
determine
spatial
association between groups of standing versus fallen
snags, with high values of K12(t) indicating attraction
between the two groups, values within the conﬁdence
interval indicating no spatial relation (independence),
and low values indicating negative spatial association
between the two groups (Lotwick and Silverman,
1982; Diggle, 1983; Upton and Fingleton, 1985).
Moran’s I, a measure of spatial autocorrelation, was
computed for tree height and tree diameter sizes for all
snags (Moran, 1950; Cliff and Ord, 1973, 1981; Upton
and Fingleton, 1985; Odland, 1988; Legendre and
Fortin, 1989). Signiﬁcant positive spatial autocorrela-
tions indicated patches of similar snags (same height
or same dbh), whereas negative spatial autocorrelation
indicated patches of dissimilar snags (mixed heights or
mixed dbh) (Legendre, 1993; Haase, 1995; Mast and
Veblen, 1999; Mast and Wolf, 2004). Duncan’s (1990)
spatial statistics program was used for these computa-
tions. Statistical signiﬁcance for each test was
determined by computing 95% conﬁdence intervals
using 99 simulations (Besag and Diggle, 1977;
Marriott, 1979). Since a sample size of >30 was
needed to run the statistical program, only the burned
plots were analyzed.
3. Results
3.1. Snag characteristics
3.1.1. Baseline data (Time 0)
We tagged and measured 1678 standing snags: 668
snags on the H96 ﬁre plots, 1010 snags on the P00 ﬁre
plots. Most snags were on burned plots (H96 ﬁre: 630
on burned plots, 38 on unburned plots; P00 ﬁre: 996 on
burned plots, 14 on unburned plots). We cored and
aged 70% of snags on the H96 ﬁre plots (29 of 38 on
unburned plots, 436 of 630 on burned plots) and 96%
of snags on the P00 ﬁre plots (6 of 14 on unburned
plots, 960 of 996 on burned plots). We were unable to
obtain a usable core on some snags on the unburned
H96 plots because of advanced decay. Most snags in
burned plots were 60 to 90 years old when ﬁre-killed
(Table 2); as live trees they likely originated from 1910

230

to 1940. Snags in unburned plots varied in age from 54
to 202 years old. Snags ranged from 11 to 88 cm dbh
and 2 to 27 m tall. We found few leaning snags. We
detected differences (P < 0.05) between snags in
burned versus unburned plots on both ﬁres in that
snags in burned plots were taller, had more bole char,
fewer cavities, and were on ﬂatter slopes than those in
unburned plots (Table 3). Snags in the P00 unburned
plots were larger diameter than in P00 burned plots.
They also had less bark remaining than in the burned
plots, likely due to more advanced decay condition (9
of 14 snags were decay class 4 or 5) (Table 4). Snags in
the H96 unburned plots had more limbs and higher
surrounding basal area than in H96 burned plots
(Table 3). For both ﬁres, snags were predominantly
in decay class 1 or 2, especially in the burned plots.

The H96 ﬁre burned in 1996 and the P00 ﬁre burned in 2000. Snags were measured 4 years post-ﬁre (H96 ﬁre) or 1 year post-ﬁre (P00 ﬁre). n is
the number of snags measured in plots. P is probability that there were no detectable differences between burned and unburned snag populations
within ﬁres using Wilcoxon two-sample tests.
a Dbh is diameter at breast height, bark cover (percent of bole with bark cover, to the nearest 5%), char (percent of bole with burn, to the nearest
5%), number of excavated cavities per snag, number of natural cavities per snag, number of dead limbs (number of dead limbs >10 cm diameter
and >30 cm length), lean (degree of snag lean from perpendicular to ground), basal area (m2 ha1) of live and dead trees surrounding each snag,
percent slope averaged from two directions at 20 m from each snag.

Most snags had intact tops and showed evidence of
foraging by birds (Table 4).
Few snags contained excavated or natural cavities
(Table 4). We found 13 snags in unburned plots (30%)
and 18 snags in burned plots (1%) with excavated
cavities. Of these 31 snags, 20 had 1 cavity: 6 (14%)
snags in unburned plots, 14 (1%) in burned plots.
Eleven snags had multiple cavities: 7 snags (16%) had
>1 cavity in unburned plots, 4 (0.3%) had >1 cavity in
burned plots. In both ﬁres the proportion of snags with
1 cavity was much greater in unburned plots than
burned plots. However, the average number of snags
per ha with cavities was similar between unburned
(2.2 ha1) and burned (3 ha1) plots. We found few
snags in burned or unburned plots with natural cavities
(Table 4).
Snags were signiﬁcantly clumped (95% CI) at all
distances (up to 20 m plot diameter) using Ripley’s
K(t). Spatial autocorrelation, using Moran’s I, found
patches of same-sized (dbh) snags as well as patches
of same-height snags (95% CI). There was only 1
patch of mixed-size and mixed-height snags.
3.1.2. Remeasurement data (Time 1)
Fewer snags fell between Times 0 and 1 on the P00
(14%) than the H96 (41%) burned plots when we
remeasured them 3- and 7-years post-ﬁre, respectively.
No snags fell on P00 unburned plots; 26% of snags
were no longer standing on H96 unburned plots. On
burned plots, larger snags were less likely to fall than
smaller snags (Fig. 1). Most loss was due to snags
falling (breaking at base or uprooting) as opposed to
being missing (cut or not found) (1–4% of total snags
on burned plots, 0–8% on unburned plots). Some
snags were leaning in all plots (1–2% of total snags on
burned plots, 7–11% on unburned plots).

Baseline data for snags was taken in 2000 for H96 and 2001 for P00. Snags were remeasured in 2003 (Time 1) which was 7 years post-ﬁre for H96
ﬁre or 3 years post-ﬁre for P00 ﬁre. P is the probability that no change was detected between Times 0 and 1 in number of standing snags, decay

tops 3 or 7 years post-ﬁre than when they were ﬁrst
measured 1 or 4 years post-ﬁre, respectively. Snags in
burned plots were in more advanced decay classes
when remeasured on both the H96 and P00 ﬁres
(P < 0.0001) but not in unburned plots (P  0.7)
(Table 6).
We did not detect differences in number of
excavated or natural cavities between Times 0 and
1 (Table 5). We found evidence of foraging by
woodpeckers in most snags when we measured them
initially, so did not detect a difference when we
remeasured them (P  0.3) (Table 6).
Snags were signiﬁcantly clumped (95% CI) at all
distances up to 20 m diameter using Ripley’s K(t).
Using Ripley’s K12(t), we found signiﬁcant negative
spatial association between fallen snags at Time 1
versus those still standing at Time 1.
3.1.3. Characteristics of burned snags that
remained standing
We were unable to develop a model for burned
snags using H96 and P00 plots combined (goodness-
of-ﬁt P < 0.01), so we developed separate models for
each ﬁre. Our sample size was too small to develop a
logistic regression model explaining which snags
remained standing in unburned plots.
Whether a ponderosa pine snag remained standing
(n = 850) or not (n = 145) 3 years post-burn on the
Pumpkin ﬁre could be predicted by a logistic
regression model that included basal area of live
and dead trees surrounding the snag at Time 0
(likelihood
ratio
P < 0.0001,
goodness-of-ﬁt
P = 0.06). Three-year-old ﬁre-killed snags were more
likely
to
remain
standing
if
they
had
higher
surrounding basal area at Time 0. This model
accurately classiﬁed 52% of standing snags. However,
the best model predicting whether a ponderosa pine
snag remained standing included both basal area of
live and dead trees surrounding the snag at Time 0
and basal area of live and dead trees surrounding the
snag when remeasured at Time 1 (likelihood ratio
P < 0.0001, goodness-of-ﬁt P = 0.4). Three-year-old
ﬁre-killed snags were more likely to remain standing if
they had higher surrounding basal area (live and dead
trees) (Fig. 2). This model accurately classiﬁed 87% of
standing snags.
Whether a ponderosa pine snag remained stand-
ing (n = 368) or not (n = 258) in burned stands 7
years post-burn at the Hochderffer ﬁre was best
predicted
by
a
logistic
regression
model
that
included dbh at Time 0, height at Time 0, lean at
Time 0, basal area of surrounding live and dead trees
at Time 0, and basal area of surrounding live and
dead trees at Time 1 (likelihood ratio P < 0.0001,
goodness-of-ﬁt
P = 0.4).
Snags
most
likely
to
persist on the H96 ﬁre were straight, short, large
diameter, and in clumps of live and/or dead trees
(Fig. 3). This model accurately classiﬁed 79% of
standing snags.

snags that helped distinguish standing from fallen snags. Snags
were measured on Pumpkin ﬁre (P) which burned in 2000. Snags
were measured in 2001 (996 standing snags) and 2003 (839 standing
and 157 fallen snags). (A) BA1 and (B) BA0 were basal area of
surrounding trees (live and dead) when snags were remeasured at 3
years post-ﬁre (BA1) and 1 year post-ﬁre (BA0).

3.1.4. Characteristics of snags containing
excavated cavities
Whether a snag contained excavated cavities
(n = 31) or not (n = 59) was best predicted by dbh
and top condition measured at Time 0 (likelihood ratio
P < 0.0001; goodness-of-ﬁt P = 0.3). The probability
of a ponderosa pine snag containing excavated cavities
increased if the top was broken and as dbh of the snag
increased (Fig. 4). This model accurately classiﬁed
83% of standing snags with excavated cavities.

4. Discussion
4.1. Snag dynamics
Wildﬁre can dramatically increase snag density
across a landscape, creating a pulse of new snags and
altering vegetation class from mature forest to open
grasslands with snags. The burned snags in severely
burned areas that we monitored were much denser
(17–70 times) than unburned snags in ponderosa pine
forests that had not burned. We found that snags in
Hochderffer burned plots most likely to remain
standing were straight, large diameter, broken-topped
snags in denser clumps. We suspected that wind
affected top condition of snags in our study by
breaking
snags
at
heights
>1.8 m
which
then
contributed to their stability. Raphael and Morrison
(1987) similarly reported that snag longevity for pine
species (Pinus spp.) was greater for larger diameter,
less decayed, shorter height snags with broken tops.
However, in our study wind also felled snags (breaking
to <1.8 m height or uprooting them). Having higher
basal area of live or dead trees surrounding a snag
appeared to protect them by slowing fall rate; most
likely these clumps helped block wind. Ponderosa
pine snags appeared to be stable for 3–4 years post-
ﬁre, but began to fall at higher rates after this time. We
suspected that unburned snags would persist longer
than burned snags, especially in smaller size classes.
Because of our small sample size for unburned snags,
we were unable to test this.
Ponderosa pine snag dynamics in severely burned
areas have been described in other parts of the western
United States. We observed remarkably similar fall
rates to these areas, with high losses of snags within a
short time period (4–7 years). For example, Bull (1983)
found that 11% of burned ponderosa pine snags fell
within 4 years. She also found that top breakage
occurred rapidly, possibly because the thick bark of
ponderosa pine retained moisture that promoted decay.
We found a similar fall rate on the P00 ﬁre; with 14% of
burned snags fallen 3 years after ﬁre (Fig. 5).
Other studies examined fall rate by dbh size class.
Keen (1929) reported that 42% of smaller (25–46 cm

ﬁrst measured in 2000, remeasured in 2003; P = Pumpkin ﬁre,

ﬁrst measured in 2001, remeasured in 2003) (six pairs: three burned
and three unburned on each ﬁre). Data represent a subset of snags
measured; n = 31 for snags with excavated cavities, n = 59 for snags
without excavated cavities. (A) Top condition for snags is intact or
broken, (B) dbh0 is diameter at breast height of snag.

standing post-ﬁre on the Pumpkin (P00) and Hochderffer (H96)
burned plots from northern Arizona, compared with studies by Keen
(1929), Dahms (1949), Bull (1983), and Everett et al. (1999). Bull’s
(1983) data were for 4 years post-ﬁre, Keen (1929) and Everett et al.
(1999) were for 7 years post-ﬁre, and Dahms (1949) for 10 years
post-ﬁre. The P00 burned plots are for 3 years post-ﬁre (P) and the
H96 for 7 years post-ﬁre (H).

dbh) ponderosa pine snags remained standing 7 years
post-ﬁre. Although we found a higher percentage
(60%) of our 7-year-old snags in this dbh class
standing, we initially undercounted snags on the H96
ﬁre since we did not tag snags until 4 years after the
H96 ﬁre occurred. We monitored only standing
snags, so it is likely that some snags had already
fallen (e.g., 14% as we found on P00 ﬁre plots),
especially in these smaller size classes. However, we
did ﬁnd similar fall rates for larger snags; 62% of
snags 51–71 cm dbh were standing 7 years post-ﬁre
compared with 57% described by Keen (1929)
(Fig. 5). Dahms (1949) reported that only 25% of
ponderosa pine 20–51 cm dbh snags were standing
10 years post-ﬁre but larger burned snags persisted
longer (65% of 51–76 cm and 85% of 76–107 cm
dbh snags remained standing) (Fig. 5). We found 60,
62, and 100% of snags on our burned plots in these
size categories were standing 7 years post-ﬁre
(although we only had two snags in the largest size
category) and will continue to monitor snag fall with
the expectation that larger dbh burned snags will
persist longer than smaller snags.
Everett et al. (1999) found that about 50% of
ponderosa pine snags <23 cm dbh fell or broke to
minimum 1.8 m height during the ﬁrst 7–12 years
post-ﬁre. We found 46% of <23 cm dbh snags had
fallen 7 years post-ﬁre; however, only 13% of 4-year-
old burned snags had fallen (Fig. 5). Raphael and
Morrison (1987) also reported high fall rates for pine
species with most fall (68%) occurring within the ﬁrst
5 years of burn. Fall rates for ponderosa pine snags
appear to greatly increase 4 years post-burn, especially
for smaller dbh size classes (Raphael and Morrison,
1987). Everett et al. (1999) also reported that most
burned ponderosa pine snags 23 cm dbh reached
decay class 3 (soft snags, bark and branches absent,
bole intact, minimum of top breakage) 15–25 years
post-ﬁre. Seven years post-ﬁre our snags were
primarily in decay class 2, suggesting a similar
progression in decay over time.
4.2. Use by cavity excavators
Cavity excavators used large diameter (e.g., 40 cm)
burned snags within 3–4 years of creation by wildﬁre,
suggesting the importance of retaining large diameter
snags, regardless of origin, to wildlife. Although we
did not have large numbers of unburned snags for
comparison, the high mean density of cavities (1 per
snag) reﬂected their importance to cavity nesters.
Snags were not a limiting factor for cavity nesters
in severely burned areas; instead, territoriality of birds
may explain the similar cavity densities of 2.2–3 ha1
that we observed in burned and unburned plots. Hairy
woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) and Lewis’s wood-
peckers (Melanerpes lewis) nested and northern
ﬂickers (Colaptes auratus) foraged in burned areas
in and around our plots. These species could account
for the creation of cavities in recently-burned snags
since they have been found to be more abundant in
recent
wildﬁre-burned
areas
(hairy
woodpecker,
Covert, 2003), have higher reproductive success in
crown-burned ponderosa pine forests (Lewis’ wood-
pecker, Saab and Vierling, 2001), or are suspected to
respond positively to high severity, stand replacement
ﬁre (Saab and Dudley, 1998).
Saab and Dudley (1998) also found that primary
cavity nesters selected nest sites in clumps of snags
and that nest trees were larger diameter, more heavily
decayed snags with broken tops. Thus, both burn
severity and spatial arrangement of snags affected
cavity nester use. These ﬁndings are markedly similar
to ours. Snags in burned and unburned plots used by
cavity excavators were more likely to be large
diameter and broken topped or shorter in height.
We did not ﬁnd a relationship with decay class but
many of the cavities we found were in 1–4-year-old
burned snags in early stages of decay.
Ganey and Vojta (2004) compared cavity density
and characteristics of snags containing excavated
cavities in unburned ponderosa pine and mixed conifer
forests in northern Arizona. Cavities were more often
found in large dbh ponderosa pine that were in more
advanced decay classes and had broken tops. The
similarity of their ﬁndings in unburned snags with our
ﬁndings in burned and unburned snags indicates that
retaining large diameter snags across the landscape,
regardless of burn severity, is important to cavity
nesters.
5. Conclusions
Wildﬁre can alter snag density across a landscape,
creating pulses of snags of similar decay class. The

availability of snags in larger size classes will
therefore depend on the size classes of live trees that
were ﬁre-killed. We had a range of size classes in our
burned plots. Habitat remaining will affect cavity-
nesting species. Burned and unburned snag plots in
our study differed because qualities of ﬁre-killed snags
differed from those of ‘‘naturally’’ killed snags.
Burned and unburned snags were created through
different disturbances, and differed in spatial and
temporal distribution. Cavity nester use of both burned
and unburned snags suggested that even though snags
were
created
by
different
processes,
both
are
important as wildlife habitat. Burned snags beneﬁt
species such as hairy, Lewis’s, and black-backed
woodpeckers because of the type of habitat created
(high density of burned snags that are used for both
nesting and foraging) (Hutto, 1995; Saab and Vierling,
2001; Kotliar et al., 2002; Covert, 2003). Other species
select unburned over burned snags or snags in
unburned areas (Kotliar et al., 2002). Thus, resource
managers should retain both unburned and burned
snags. Larger diameter snags will be useful for
nesting, both large and small diameter snags for
foraging.
Retaining large diameter snags surrounded by
higher basal area of live and/or dead trees should help
retain ﬁre-killed snags longer. Bird responses to ﬁre
were inﬂuenced by a number of factors (e.g., burn size,
burn severity, pre- and post-ﬁre cover types, time since
ﬁre), and salvage logging could alter species’ use of
burns (Kotliar et al., 2002). Many cavity nesting birds
do not use heavily salvaged burns, but some can likely
persist in partially salvaged burns (Hutto, 1995;
Kotliar et al., 2002). Raphael and Morrison (1987)
suggested that models of snag dynamics must include
species, condition of trees becoming snags, and factors
causing trees to die. Burn condition appeared to be a
factor affecting snag longevity. Burned ponderosa
pine snags may not last as long as unburned snags, so it
will be important to track how snags created by
different methods are used by cavity nesters.
Our ﬁndings are very similar to other studies of
snag dynamics and cavity nesting bird use following
ﬁre that have been conducted throughout the western
United States. Severely burned areas experience a
large pulse of snags that may be followed by a long
interval of little to no recruitment of large snags.
Because burned snags may not last as long, but are
important to some cavity nesters, it will be important
to track snag replacement over time so a landscape
does not become devoid of snags.
