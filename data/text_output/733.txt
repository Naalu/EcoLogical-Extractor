Abstract.
The Rara´ muri (Tarahumara) people live in the mountains and canyons of the
Sierra Madre Occidental of Chihuahua, Mexico. They base their subsistence on multiple-use
strategies of their natural resources, including agriculture, pastoralism, and harvesting of
native plants and wildlife. Pino Gordo is a Rara´ muri settlement in a remote location where the
forest has not been commercially logged. We reconstructed the forest ﬁre regime from ﬁre-
scarred trees, measured the structure of the never-logged forest, and interviewed community
members about ﬁre use. Fire occurrence was consistent throughout the 19th and 20th centuries
up to our ﬁre scar collection in 2004. This is the least interrupted surface-ﬁre regime reported
to date in North America. Studies from other relict sites such as nature reserves in Mexico or
the USA have all shown some recent alterations associated with industrialized society. At Pino
Gordo, ﬁres recurred frequently at the three study sites, with a composite mean ﬁre interval of
1.9 years (all ﬁres) to 7.6 years (ﬁres scarring 25% or more of samples). Per-sample ﬁre
intervals averaged 10–14 years at the three sites. Approximately two-thirds of ﬁres burned in
the season of cambial dormancy, probably during the pre-monsoonal drought. Forests were
dominated by pines and contained many large living trees and snags, in contrast to two nearby
similar forests that have been logged. Community residents reported using ﬁre for many
purposes, consistent with previous literature on ﬁre use by indigenous people. Pino Gordo is a
valuable example of a continuing frequent-ﬁre regime in a never-harvested forest. The
Rara´ muri people have actively conserved this forest through their traditional livelihood and
management techniques, as opposed to logging the forest, and have also facilitated the ﬁre
regime by burning. The data contribute to a better understanding of the interactions of
humans who live in pine forests and the ﬁre regimes of these ecosystems, a topic that has been
controversial and difﬁcult to assess from historical or paleoecological evidence.
Key words:
dendrochronology; ﬁre scars; human-caused ignition; pine–oak forest; Pino Gordo; Sierra
Madre Occidental.
INTRODUCTION
The degree to which traditional human activities
affected historical ﬁre regimes and ecosystems is subject
to considerable debate, as the assumption of ‘‘pristine’’
character in pre-industrialized environments has been
questioned (Denevan 1992, Vale 2002). Aboriginal
people practiced ﬁring techniques to regulate burn
severity in tropical north Australia (Lewis 1994), while
Native Americans in California applied sophisticated
burning techniques to produce food and basketry
materials, using ﬁres that affected broad landscapes
and
maintained
characteristic
vegetation
types
(Anderson 1999). In contrast, Baker (2002) argued that
the low density of Native Americans in the Rocky
Mountains barely affected ﬁre regimes. In the neighbor-
ing Southwest, where pre-Columbian human popula-
tions were high and ﬁres were frequent, Allen (2002)
concurred that humans had little effect but for a
different reason: the saturating density of lightning
ignitions. Some sedimentary evidence of ﬁre in central
Mexico suggests that long-term human settlement
substantially degraded landscapes (O’Hara et al. 1994),
while other data in the region have been interpreted as
showing little human inﬂuence on ﬁre regimes or
ecosystems (Figueroa-Rangel et al. 2008).
The complexity of past human relationships with ﬁre
regimes and the difﬁculty of interpreting paleoecological
evidence are of more than theoretical interest, because
contemporary
resource
management
decisions
are
fraught with assumptions, often not explicit, about
‘‘naturalness’’ (Govender et al. 2006). For example,
current policies in the United States and Mexico
generally regard human-caused ﬁre as nonnatural and
subject to suppression (Stephens and Ruth 2005,
Rodrı´guez-Trejo 2008). However, the disruption of ﬁre
disturbance regimes in many pine forest ecosystems
coupled with climate warming has contributed to

problems such as severe wildﬁres, pathogen outbreaks,
or drought-facilitated tree mortality (Minnich et al.
1995), leading to calls for restoration of appropriate ﬁre
regimes (Allen et al. 2002, Millar et al. 2007). Detailed
information about ﬁre regimes in ecosystems where
people maintain traditional practices would be valuable
for designing ﬁre management strategies. Unfortunately,
the advent of modern forest land uses typically
coincided with the removal of indigenous people or
alteration of their traditional way of life (Anderson
1999).
The Sierra Tarahumara in northern Mexico is one of
the few places in North America where questions about
humans and ﬁre can be examined in a landscape that is,
in some areas, undisturbed by mechanical logging and
road building. The Tarahumara, or Rara´ muri as they
refer to themselves, are an Uto-Aztecan-speaking people
(Pennington 1963) whose population is estimated at
70 000. Their territory is currently recognized as
covering an area of ;60 000 km2, though not legally
acknowledged by the land tenure structure in Mexico.
This area comprises 17 municipalities on the southwest-
ern border of the state of Chihuahua, generally known
as the Sierra Tarahumara. Many Tarahumara live in
rancherı´as (single or clustered family farm settlements),
raising corn, beans, and squash and herding goats and
sheep in ways very similar to their 17th-century
ancestors (Pennington 1963). Many practice annual
migrations, maintaining residences in the high moun-
tains during the summer when forage for livestock and
conditions for crop production are good, and moving to
sheltered canyon bottoms during the harsh winters of
the highlands (Hard and Merrill 1992).
Ethnographic literature records several uses of ﬁre by
Tarahumara that affected landscapes of the Sierra. In
May 1894, explorer Carl Lumholtz (Lumholtz 1902)
recorded the difﬁculty in ﬁnding forage for his mules
because more than 100 miles of montane grasslands
between the communities of Yoquivo and Guachochi
had been burned, supposedly to bring rain. Other uses of
ﬁre include clearing brush from agricultural ﬁelds or
stimulating growth of grass, and driving deer, rabbits, or
foxes
towards
waiting
hunters
(Hartman
1897,
Pennington 1963). Members of the community of
Bası´huare maintain kumerachi (also known as mawechi),
areas burned for shifting agriculture and oak coppice
(Davidson-Hunt 2003). These disturbed areas also
provide habitats for ruderal plants that are harvested
for food (LaRochelle and Berkes 2003).
Pino Gordo-Choreachi (hereafter, ‘‘Pino Gordo’’) is a
Rara´ muri community formed of smaller rancherı´as,
located in southwestern Chihuahua, and it contains one
of the largest fragments of unharvested pine–oak forest
remaining in the Sierra Madre Occidental (Lammertink
et al. 1996). Since the beginning of mechanized logging
in the late 19th century, .99% of the Madrean forest
has been subject to one or more commercial timber
harvests, which typically removed the largest diameter
trees, and reduced stand age and structural diversity
(Lammertink et al. 1996). Old-growth fragments that
remain are often in inaccessible terrain, in territories
controlled by indigenous communities, or are the
subjects of land disputes, which have prevented them
from being harvested. All of these factors have
contributed to maintain the forest in Pino Gordo in an
unharvested
state
with
very
limited
road
access.
Approximately 800 Rara´ muri people live in more than
48 small, isolated rancherı´as throughout the ejido of
Pino Gordo (D. Curiel-Cante, R. W. Gingrich, A. M.
Miller, and A.-B. Mancera-Valencia, unpublished man-
uscript). (An ejido is a communal landholding.) The local
economy is based largely on subsistence crops (corn,
beans, and squash) and livestock (goats, sheep, cows,
and burros) production. Many residents of Pino Gordo
maintain winter residences in the oak and tropical
deciduous zones on the slopes and canyon bottoms of
the Barranca de la Sinforosa, where they ﬁsh, graze their
goat herds, and avoid the colder temperatures of the
high elevations.
Pino Gordo is a remote area with substantial social,
political, and economic problems, including violence, so
research activities are limited by access and safety
concerns (Miller and Chambers 2007). We took
advantage of rare opportunities from 2003 to 2007 to
visit Pino Gordo, in collaboration with local residents
and governmental and nongovernmental organizations,
to ask the following questions:
1) In an area under traditional management by indig-
enous people, what is the long-term ﬁre regime, has it
changed over time, and does it differ from those
observed elsewhere in the Sierra Madre Occidental?
2) What are the characteristics and variability of forest
composition and structure in a frequently burned,
never commercially harvested forest?
3) Are ﬁre uses reported by community members and in
the literature consistent with measurements of ﬁre
regime and forest structure?
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study area
Three study sites were located within Pino Gordo
(Fig.
1)
in
the
Sierra
Madre
Occidental
in
the
municipality of Guadalupe y Calvo, western Chihua-
hua (2683305300 N, 1078101500 W). Pino Gordo contains
;29 000 ha of high mesas and deep arroyos ranging in
elevation from 2671 m above sea level to 915 m above
sea level. The area between 1600 and 2600 m above sea
level, ;15 000 ha, is pine–oak forest according to
Rzedowski’s (1978) classiﬁcation of the vegetation of
Me´ xico. Tree species in this forest include pines such as
Pinus arizonica, P. durangensis, P. engelmannii, P.
leiophylla var. chihuahuana, P. lumholtzii, and P.
strobiformis (pine taxonomy follows Farjon and Styles
[1997]). Oaks include Quercus rugosa, Q. hypoleucoides

and Q. emoryii. Mexican manzanita (Arctostaphylos
pungens) and yucca (Yucca sp.) are common understory
plants, especially on exposed south-facing slopes and in
forest gaps.
The average annual temperature in Pino Gordo is
between 158 and 208C, with a maximum below 228C and
annual minimum above 108C (Aguilar-Uranga 1959).
Annual average precipitation is ,60 cm (Pase and
Brown 1994). The monsoon season begins from mid to
late June and lasts until September. Approximately 70%
of the annual precipitation occurs during this period,
and lightning storms can occur almost daily. The
majority of the remaining 30% occurs as rain or snow
between November and January.
Fire scar sampling and analysis
We established three ﬁre scar sampling sites in the
upper (AC), middle (MC), and lower (BC) portions of
the Arroyo Coyachi to characterize ﬁre regimes (Fig. 1).
Each site was ;15 ha in size. Fire-scarred tree sampling

samples used in the analysis are indicated with solid circles. Fire-scarred samples that could not be cross dated are shown with open
circles. From southeast to northwest, the sites are Arriba Coyachi (AC), Medio Coyachi (MC), and Bajo Coyachi (BC). The Cerro
Grande (CG) site is ;39 km northwest (not shown).

was done in August 2003. Each study site was
thoroughly searched for ﬁre-scarred trees. Partial
cross-sections were cut from scarred ‘‘catfaces’’ on trees,
snags, logs, and stumps of conifers apparently contain-
ing the oldest and/or most extensive ﬁre records.
Samples from living trees were collected as partial
cross-sections, a method that does not require felling the
tree and that rarely causes lasting damage to large pine
trees, such as those we sampled (Heyerdahl and McKay
2008). Samples were mapped when collected and were
well distributed throughout the study sites (Fig. 1).
Characteristics of the sampled trees are summarized in
Table 1.
In the laboratory, samples were mounted and
surfaced until cell structure could be seen clearly under
a microscope. Samples were cross dated using charac-
teristic patterns of narrow marker years (Stokes and
Smiley 1968). A master tree-ring chronology developed
in Bisaloachic (Tutuaca), ;200 km north of Pino
Gordo, was also used in cross dating (J. Villanueva-
Dı´az, unpublished data). After dating, ring widths of all
samples were measured in order to check dating with the
Cofecha program (Holmes 1983). The season of ﬁre
occurrence (Baisan and Swetnam 1990) was estimated
based on the relative position of each ﬁre lesion within
the annual ring according to the following categories:
EE (early earlywood), ME (middle earlywood), LE (late
earlywood), L (latewood), and D (dormant or ring
boundary). Dormant season scars were assigned to the
year of the following earlywood (i.e., spring ﬁres)
(Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003, Fule´ et al. 2005). The
season was listed as ‘‘not determined’’ when it could not
be distinguished clearly.
Fire history data were analyzed with the FHX2
software, version 2.05 (Grissino-Mayer 2001). Analysis
at each site began in the ﬁrst year with an adequate
sample depth, deﬁned as the ﬁrst ﬁre year recorded by
10% or more of the total number of recording trees at
each site. ‘‘Recording’’ trees are those with open ﬁre
scars or other injuries (e.g., lightning scars), leaving
them susceptible to repeated scarring by ﬁre (Swetnam
and Baisan 1996b). Beginning dates were 1847 (AC),
1816 (MC), and 1813 (BC). The period of analysis for
all Pino Gordo ﬁre scars combined began in 1835. A
common ﬁre history ending date of 2003 was used.
Fire return intervals were ﬁltered for analysis. The
statistical distribution of ﬁre intervals using all ﬁre years
was assessed. Then only those ﬁre years were included in
which 10% or more, or 25% or more, of the recording
samples were scarred. After assessing the Pino Gordo
study sites individually, all the data were combined,
representing 45 ha in total, and the complete distribu-
tion of ﬁre return intervals was described using the same
three ﬁlters: all scars, 10%-scarred, and 25%-scarred.
These ﬁlters were used because the all-scar ﬁlter shows
every single ﬁre year, but in some years only one or two
trees were scarred. The 10% ﬁlter eliminates the years
with the most minimal scarring, but still represents a
relatively high estimate of ﬁre frequency. The 25% ﬁlter
is widely used as an estimate of ﬁre frequency
considering those ﬁres that were relatively large and/or
intense (Swetnam and Baisan 1996b).
Forest structure
We determined a sampling area of approximately 7 3
6 km, representative of the forests of Pino Gordo. We
generated a map with 100 random sampling points.
Since the terrain is so rugged and access is mostly by
walking trails, every morning we selected a direction in
which to walk and located nearby sampling points with
a GPS unit. At 26 sampling points, we established 1000-
m2 circular plots (17.85 m radius) centered on the
coordinates of the random points (Fig. 1).
We used metric tapes and ropes to lay down radii and
mark subsections within each plot. We collected the
following data for all living trees .5 cm in diameter at
breast height (dbh): species; dbh; heights for represen-
tative trees in the following canopy classes, emergent,
dominant, codominant, intermediate, suppressed; and
damage type if applicable (ﬁre scar or char on trunk,
topped, lightning scar). We also measured dbh for the
standing dead trees (snags) in each plot.
Forest data were grouped by vegetation type (20 pine–
oak forest plots, 1 juniper woodland plot, 5 open/
disturbed plots). We analyzed forest structure for the
pine–oak forest, calculating species composition, tree
density, and basal area. We estimated biomass using
allometric equations (Na´ var 2009).
For comparison to the Pino Gordo forest structure,
we measured a site that had been heavily and repeatedly
harvested 39 km to the north on the other side of a deep
canyon, the Barranca de la Sinforosa, at Cerro
Grande (CG), Municipio Guachochi, 26853056.0100 N,
107810024.0700 W, in April 1997. Field sampling was
conducted over an ;15-ha study area. We measured
trees at the Cerro Grande site (CG) on 20 circular plots

200 m2 in size (7.98 m radius). Plots were located on a
100-m grid. Measurements included species, condition
(living/snag decay class/cut stump), dbh, and height. We
also compared the Pino Gordo forest data to tree data
reported by Miller and Chambers (2007) from Ejido
Cabo´ rachi, close to the CG site, ;40 km north of Pino
Gordo on the north side of the Barranca de la Sinforosa.
Forests in the Ejido Cabo´ rachi and Cerro Grande were
similar in elevation and species composition to Pino
Gordo, but had been heavily harvested.
Community interviews
In spring 2003, three local indigenous ﬁeld assistants
(two men and one woman) assisted us in collecting
standardized interviews from 21 Pino Gordo residents
on their use of and understanding of the effects of ﬁre.
Their ﬂuency in Rara´ muri allowed us to collect
information from monolingual informants. Questions
focused on: ﬁre uses at home, around the ranch and
away from residences; frequency with which informants
used ﬁre to clear ﬁelds and other agricultural practices;
how they perceived ﬁre to beneﬁt soil, animals, and
plants; if and when people chose to suppress ﬁre; and
how ﬁre practices of previous generations may have
differed from those currently in use. The interview
component of this study is limited because none of the
investigators have formal training in interviews or other
social science techniques, nor did we wish to be intrusive
toward the residents. Therefore we constrained our
questioning to a brief list.
RESULTS
Fire regime
A continuous pattern of frequent surface ﬁres was
observed at all three Pino Gordo study sites from the
earliest reliable dates (1813–1847) up to the present
(Fig. 2), based on 82 cross-dated specimens out of a
total of 92 samples collected (Table 1). The ﬁnal ﬁre
occurred at site AC in 2003, MC in 1998, and BC in
1999, respectively 1, 6, and 5 years before the ﬁeld
sampling in 2004. Fire frequency calculated in a 10-
year moving window averaged 4.97 ﬁres per decade
(Fig. 2). The ﬁre frequency dropped to a low of 2.30
ﬁres per decade in 1984–1994, before rising back to 6
ﬁres per decade by 1998. Fire occurrence at the lowest-
elevation site, BC, changed to a pattern of less frequent
but more consistently scarring ﬁres beginning around
1960. Mean ﬁre intervals (MFI) ranged from 2.5 to 3.3
yr at individual 15-ha sites, considering all ﬁre dates,
and from 6.0 to 6.8 yr when data were ﬁltered to
include only ﬁre years in which 25% or more of the
recording samples were scarred (Table 2). Combining
all sites, the overall MFI dropped to 1.9 yr for all ﬁres
but increased to 7.6 yr for the 25%-scarred category.
Minimum ﬁre intervals were 1 or 2 years for all sites
and categories; maximum intervals between ﬁres were
all below 20 yr except for the 25%-scarred category in
site AC and the combined data from all sites (Table 2).
Average per-sample (or ‘‘point’’) ﬁre intervals ranged
from 10.2 to 13.6 yr. The Weibull model generally ﬁt
the data only in the 25%-scarred category; Weibull
median probability intervals were similar to MFI
values (,1.5 yr difference) (Table 2).
Seasonal position of ﬁre lesions could be determined
on 481 out the 652 ﬁre scars (74%) (Table 3).
Approximately two-thirds of the scars occurred in the
dormant season. Early and middle earlywood made up
an additional 44.7%. Only an average of 1.7% of scars
formed in the late earlywood and no latewood scars
were found, indicating that the assignment of dormant-
season scars to the year of the following earlywood (i.e.,
spring ﬁres) was justiﬁed.

FIRE REGIME IN A MEXICAN FOREST

Forest composition and structure
The unharvested forest at Pino Gordo was dominated
in basal area and density by pines (Table 4). Oaks were
less dense than pines (190 vs. 498 trees/ha) and made up
less basal area (5.93 vs. 17.75 m2/ha) (Table 4). Other
species, junipers, madrones, and hardwoods, made up
,7% of the total basal area. Pines were relatively large,
with quadratic mean diameter equal to 21.3 cm; the
largest individual had a dbh ¼ 69.1 cm. The quadratic
mean diameter of oaks was 19.9 cm and the largest oak
was also the largest tree encountered in the forest, with
dbh ¼ 79.7 cm. The overall diameter distribution of the
forest was unimodal with a peak in the 10.1–30 cm class
(Fig. 3). Trees .30 cm dbh made up 13% of the total
density; trees .50 cm made up 2% of the distribution.
Pine stumps, reﬂecting cutting by residents for domestic
uses, averaged 0.5 stumps/ha. Total aboveground
biomass averaged 132 Mg/ha, of which pines made up
89 Mg/ha.
In contrast to Pino Gordo, both of the harvested
forest sites had less pine basal area, smaller trees, and
many pine stumps. The total basal area at Cerro Grande
was approximately equal to that of Pino Gordo, but the
pine basal area was only 65% that of the unharvested
site; at Ejido Cabo´ rachi, total basal area was 32% and
pine basal area was 33% that of Pino Gordo (Table 4).
Quadratic mean diameters of pines and oaks were 18.5
cm and 14.5 cm at Cerro Grande and 15.3 cm and 23.2
cm at Ejido Cabo´ rachi, respectively. Diameter distribu-
tions at both harvested sites were strongly dominated by
the smallest trees (Fig. 3). Trees .30 cm dbh made up
5% and 8% of the total density at Cerro Grande and
Ejido Cabo´ rachi, respectively. Trees .50 cm made up
2% of the distribution at Ejido Cabo´ rachi; there were no
trees .50 cm at Cerro Grande. Pine stumps from past
harvests averaged 17.5 and 26.0 stumps/ha at Cerro
Grande and Ejido Cabo´ rachi, respectively. Total above-
ground biomass at Cerro Grande averaged 108 Mg/ha,
of which pines made up 57 Mg/ha.
Densities of large snags also differed between Pino
Gordo and the harvested sites. The Pino Gordo forest
had 11.5 snags/ha with dbh . 30 cm and 2.0 snags/ha
with dbh . 50 cm. Only 2.5 snags/ha . 30 cm were
encountered at Cerro Grande and 0.5 snags/ha with dbh
. 30 cm at Ejido Cabo´ rachi. Neither of the harvested
sites had any snags .50 cm.
Fire use in the community
Several uses of wildland ﬁre were reported by 21 Pino
Gordo residents from seven rancherı´as (Table 5). Two
uses were related to agricultural cultivation: clearing
new ﬁelds and fertilizing ﬁelds. Other uses, such as
improving livestock forage, hunting, and managing
areas for ﬁrewood, are consistent with previous reports
in the literature. Domestic uses included lighting, heat,
ﬁring pottery, and cooking. The ﬁnal ﬁre use mentioned
was bringing rain. Ecological effects of ﬁre mentioned
by residents included causing sprouting, nourishing
vegetation, and increasing growth, and attracting
animals to fresh browse and birds to live in snags.
Improved growth of medicinal plants and fungi follow-
ing ﬁre was noted by several people.
DISCUSSION
The frequent surface-ﬁre regime at Pino Gordo is the
least interrupted sequence of ﬁres up to the present
reported to date in North America. There is no evidence
of ﬁre regime disruption from the early 19th century

(1813–1847) into the ﬁrst decade of the 21st century
(2004), except at site BC, which showed reduced
frequency and increased synchrony of ﬁres beginning
around 1960. During the same time period elsewhere in
North America and locally in northern Mexico, ﬁre
regime disruption has been associated with events such
as the introduction of sheep to the Navajo in Arizona
circa 1820 (Savage and Swetnam 1990); widespread
livestock grazing across the southwest USA beginning
around 1860 in California and 1880 in Arizona and New
Mexico, coincident with the completion of transconti-
nental railroads (Swetnam and Baisan 2003); and the
formation of ejidos in northern Mexico between 1930
and 1950 (Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003). The Sierra
Tarahumara in general was unaffected by industrialized
society until the latter half of the 20th century. The
mountains were crossed by a railroad to the Paciﬁc in
1961 and harvesting accelerated to ‘‘massive’’ propor-
tions in the subsequent decades; in 2001 the municipal-
ities of the Sierra Tarahumara accounted for 97% of the
timber production in Chihuahua (Davidson-Hunt 2003).
However, the inaccessible location of Pino Gordo on the
southern side of the Barranca de la Sinforosa, as well as
internal political conﬂicts, have kept logging at bay.
Several other isolated forests in northern Mexico
maintained relatively frequent ﬁre regimes even after
the 1950s, including the Sierra San Pedro Ma´ rtir (Baja
California) (Stephens et al. 2003), Sierra de los Ajos
(Sonora) (Swetnam and Baisan 1996), Cerro Mohinora
(Chihuahua) (Cerano-Paredes 2008), and Cerro Blanco
in La Michilı´a Biosphere Reserve (Fule´ and Covington
1999). All those sites, however, displayed lengthening
ﬁre-free intervals beginning circa 1970. The pattern of
fewer but more synchronous ﬁres in the late twentieth
century that we observed at site BC resembles ﬁre regime
changes in the Sierra San Pedro Ma´ rtir (Stephens et al.
2003). At Pino Gordo, however, the neighboring
upslope sites MC and AC did not reﬂect the BC pattern;
the reason for the difference at BC is unknown.
Apart from the persistence of frequent ﬁres to the
present, the statistical characteristics of the Pino Gordo
ﬁre regime are similar to those of other pine forests in
Chihuahua and nearby areas of Mexico and the United
States. The all-scar MFI values (2.4–3.3 yr) and 25%-
scarred MFI values (6.0–6.8 yr) are at the lower end of
the range encountered elsewhere. The other published
studies in Chihuahua reported these values respectively
as 3.5–4.9 yr/6.9–8.4 yr (study sites 25 ha in size [Fule´ et
al. 2005]), 5.1–8.8 yr/13.3–13.8 yr (study sites 40–60 ha
[Cerano-Paredes 2008]), and ;4 yr (all scars only, study
sites 2–6 ha) (Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003). The next
nearest studies in northern Durango reported 3.8–5.0 yr/
6.5–8.6 yr (Fule´ and Covington 1997) and ;3 and 6
years (all scars only) (study sites 2–6 ha [Heyerdahl and
Alvarado 2003]). In the Sierra de los Ajos of Sonora,
Swetnam and Baisan (1996a) found 3.8–4.0 yr/5.5–9.1
yr (study sites 10–100 ha). Taking all three Pino Gordo
sites together, the overall composite interval of 1.9 yr

(over 45 ha) has been matched only by studies ;98
latitude north on the Mogollon Rim, Arizona, at
Limestone Flat (1.8 yr, 16 ha) (Dieterich 1980) and
Yellow Flat (1.7 yr, 100 ha) (Van Horne and Fule´ 2006).
However, surface ﬁres ceased at the Arizona sites 110–
129 years ago. Fire seasonality also followed similar
patterns at Pino Gordo as in the other forests, with
dormant-season scars predominant followed by early-
earlywood scars; almost no late earlywood or latewood
scars were reported. Elsewhere, ﬁres burning in different
seasons have been suggested as a means of separating
human-caused from lightning ignitions (Kaye and
Swetnam 1999, Skinner et al. 2009). However, we did
not observe differences at Pino Gordo compared to
other sites. Overall, the Pino Gordo ﬁre history is similar
to those of other forests in southwestern North America,
except that the Pino Gordo ﬁre regime has continued up
to the present.
The unharvested forest of Pino Gordo differed from
the two harvested forests in three key ways: larger trees,
higher proportion of pines, and the presence of large
snags. The abundant stumps of large pines in the
harvested forests attested to the cutting of the largest,
most valuable pines. If all three forests were assumed to
have
been
roughly
similar
in
structure
prior
to
harvesting, the two harvested forests have lost 35–67%
of their original pine basal area. Aboveground biomass
at Pino Gordo was 22% higher than at Cerro Grande
and pine biomass was 56% higher. Forest biomass at
Pino Gordo (132 Mg/ha) was similar to the average in
south-central Durango (130 Mg/ha), a relatively pro-
ductive region of Mexico (Na´ var 2009). Not only does
the Pino Gordo forest support more aboveground
biomass and carbon than the nearby harvested forests,
it is likely to be more resistant to severe disturbance
from ﬁre. Frequently burned pine forests in Mexico have
relatively low surface and canopy fuels (Fule´
and
Covington 1998, Stephens et al. 2007), resulting in
limited ﬁre intensity (Stephens et al. 2008). Unlike some
other frequently burned Mexican forests, the Pino
Gordo forest was fairly dense (Table 4, Fig. 4), but
the mode of the diameter distribution was in the 10.1–30
cm class (Fig. 3). Diameter distributions of the two
harvested forests were strongly skewed to the smallest
diameter class (,10 cm); a high density of small trees
indicates a greater vulnerability to ﬁre transition into the
canopy (Scott and Reinhardt 2001).
Structural features of the old forest are linked to
conservation
of
biological
diversity.
Miller
and
Chambers (2007) encountered 30 bird species on
systematic transects at Pino Gordo, as compared with
19 species at Cabo´ rachi, despite having fewer transects
at Pino Gordo. Consistent with the striking difference in
densities of large snags between Pino Gordo (13.5 snags
with dbh . 30 cm/ha) and Cabo´ rachi (0.5 snags . 30
cm/ha), twice as many primary cavity nesters were
observed at Pino Gordo (Miller and Chambers 2007).
The Acorn Woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus),
which uses large (50þ cm) snags for nest sites and
granaries, was far more frequent at Pino Gordo (Miller
and Chambers 2007). However, generalist and ground-
nesting birds were also observed, suggesting that human
activity was contributing to maintaining habitat diver-
sity (Miller and Chambers 2007); this hypothesis was
supported at the landscape scale by the fact that 12% of
our random plot locations were classiﬁed as open or
disturbed.
Human uses of ﬁre reported by Pino Gordo residents
are consistent with indigenous ﬁre use documented
nearby in the Sierra Tarahumara (Pennington 1963,
Davidson-Hunt 2003) and similar to traditional ﬁre uses
in
indigenous
communities
elsewhere
(Lewis
and
Ferguson 1988) (Fig. 4). Davidson-Hunt (2003) studied
ﬁre use by Rara´ muri people in Bası´huare, describing a
practice of burning called kumerachi in which residents
made clearings for farming in oak-dominated areas of
forest, either removing the wood for ﬁrewood or leaving
it to dry and then igniting a ﬁre coincident with the onset
of summer monsoon rains in June. Key points of
kumerachi included a sophisticated selection of ﬁeld sites
mostly on east and southeast-facing slopes, timing of
ignition when early rains had reduced ﬁre danger but
fuels were not yet saturated, and retention of mature
pine, juniper, and oak trees within the cleared area;
resprouting oaks produced multiple stems of good size
for ﬁrewood (Davidson-Hunt 2003). The effects of such
a management regime appear to be consistent with our
observations of the forest at Pino Gordo: primarily a
surface-ﬁre regime with numerous mature, ﬁre-scarred
trees; individual trees allowed to reach mature age and

size even in the perturbed sites; and undisturbed patches
interspersed with parcels used for agriculture.
While our survey with Pino Gordo ﬁre users does
provide an overview of some of the ways they continue
to use it as a land management tool, our understanding
of how they relate to ﬁre and their management
preferences remains rudimentary. Insiders’ understand-
ings of the ideal role for ﬁre in maintaining land health,
indigenous institutions for its use, and indicators for its
successful use may not be transparent to a cultural
outsider (Miller and Davidson-Hunt 2010). These
understandings, while outside the scope of the current
work, will be important for crafting a cooperative
management regime for Pino Gordo that both protects
this important ecological learning opportunity while
respecting local peoples’ culture and aspirations.
Certain questions about the role of human activities in
the ﬁre regime cannot be addressed by this study. For
example, while it is clear that the Tarahumara ignite
many ﬁres, we cannot disprove the hypothesis of Allen
(Allen 2002) that there are sufﬁcient lightning ignitions
to maintain the frequent ﬁre regime. However, Pino
Gordo is a valuable example of a continuing frequent-
ﬁre regime in a never-harvested forest. The Rara´ muri of
Pino Gordo have conserved their forests up to the
present because of their emphasis on maintaining a
traditional life, as opposed to logging the forest. They
also facilitate the ﬁre regime by burning. The presence of
large trees, high forest biomass, large snags, and birds
dependent on old forest indicate that these ecosystem
elements are compatible with frequent surface ﬁre as
well as with the current level of human resource use.
These ﬁndings suggest that conservationists should
recognize that the presence of native peoples may be a
key reason why valued resources, such as old-growth
forests, are still present. Conservation planning should
incorporate traditional knowledge and resource man-
agement practices of indigenous peoples, especially
when these practices are found to have ecologically as
well as socially beneﬁcial outcomes.
