Abstract. Stand and natural fuel conditions were sampled 
in ponderosa pine forests in northern and central Arizona 
to develop predictive fuel depth and loading equations. 
Litter and duff depths can be estimated from measure- 
ments of stand density (basal area, stand density index). 
Although woody fuel loading did not correlate well with 
stand variables, correlations were found among loadings 
of different woody fuel size classes, so that results from 
a planar intersect tally of certain single woody fuel size 
classes may be used to predict the loadings in certain 
other size classes. The relatively low precision of esti- 
mates from these predictive equations can be substan- 
tially increased by applying them in a double sampling 
scheme. Making use of these predictive relationships, 
managers can devise simple, rapid, and cost-effective 
fuel inventories that focus on the fuel category of interest. 
Fuel loads can be estimated at a desired precision with 
reduced investment of time and funds compared to a more 
comprehensive direct fuel inventory.

Introduction 
The forest floor, consisting of litter, duff, and downed 
dead woody material, plays a crucial role in many 
ecosystem processes. Information on the quantity and 
quality of forest floor components may be obtained with 
specific inventory procedures @rown et al. 1982), but 
managers often cannot invest the funds or time for 
sampling large areas. The objective of the present study 
was to develop an efficient method incorporating pre- 
dictive relationships in a double sampling scheme to 
estimate forest floor depth and woody debris loading. 
Although the data examined in detail pertain to fuels in 
southwestern ponderosa pine, the double sampling pro- 
cedure could improve efficiency of fuel sampling in 
other forest types as well. 
Forest floor characteristics of interest are litter (L 
layer), duff (F and H layers), and woody material. In 
fire management, woody material is classified by diam- 
eter and time response to moisture changes as 1-hour (0 
to 0.62 cm diameter), 10-hour (0.62 to 2.54 cm), 100- 
hour (2.54 to 7.62 cm) and 1000-hour (over 7.62 cm) 
timelag fuels. The largest class is subdivided into sound 
and rotten categories. For simplicity, woody fuels are 
referred to by timelag class rather than diameter range. 
These groups form the standard classification for fuel 
inventories (Brown et al. 1982) and fire behavior fuel 
models (Burgan and Rothermel 1984). 
Different forest floor components are important to 
managers in different ways. Litter and duff depths are 
valuable in estimation of interception of precipitation 
and erosion potential (Baker 1990), habitat of various 
species, including insects, which require litter or duff 
for all or part of their life cycles (Schmid et al. 1981), 
and cycling of nutrients (Covington and Sackett 1986). 
Duff depth is important in prescriptions for controlled 
burning, which is commonly designed to reduce duff 
depth (Harrington 1987) or to expose mineral soil to 
enhance pine seedling establishment (Haase 1986). The 
small size classes of woody fuels, together with litter, 
carry the flaming front, respond quickly to moisture 
changes, and are key inputs to fire behavior fuel models 
(Burgan and Rothermel 1984). Larger size classes of 
woody fuels are especially important in smoldering time 
(Brown and See 1981) and localized soil heating 
(Covington and Sackett 1990). 
Aldon (1968) and Ffolliott et al. (1%8) reported a 
relationship between ponderosa pine basal area and 
forest floor loading and depth for specific sites. Equa- 
tions to predict forest floor depth from basal area on a 
selectively harvested site on basalt soils in central 
Arizona were developed with coefficients of determina- 
tion (9) 
between 0.35 and 0.53 (Ffolliott et al. 1968). 
In a more extensive study across Arizona and New 
Mexico, ponderosa pine forest floors were sampled by 

Fule, P.Z., and Covington, W.W. 
Sackett (1979), who found variability too high to create 
any predictive models, even though only stands with- 
out obvious human-caused disturbance within the last 
20 years were sampled. A similar study in the northem 
Rocky Mountains showed numerous significant corre- 
lations among stand and forest floor variables, but 
again high variability precluded the development of 
predictive models (Brown and See 1981). Sackett and 
Haase (1991) stratified ponderosa pine stands in north- 
em Arizona into small even-sized groups and predicted 
forest floor loading (total of litter, duff, and woody 
fuels under 2.54 cm diameter) from average tree height, 
average tree diameter, and soil parent material (basalt 
or sedimentary). 
Presently, managers requiring information on natu- 
ral ponderosa fuels in order to evaluate fire behavior, 
risk, fuel treatments, or burning prescriptions in Ari- 
zona must choose between: (1) a comprehensive inven- 
tory of forest floor and woody fuels (Brown et al. 
1982); (2) applying predictive equations from stand 
inventory data under constraints of limited predictive 
capability (Ffolliott et al. 1968) or extensive stratifica- 
tion (Sackett and Haase 1991); (3) using a photo guide 
for estimating post-harvest residues developed in the 
Black Hills, South Dakota (LJSDA 1990), but com- 
monly applied for fuel inventory in the Southwest (Al 
Braddock, USDA Forest Service, personal communi- 
cation 1992); or (4) proceeding with only general 
vegetation type information (e.g., Fule and Bradshaw 
1992). The option of conducting a complete inventory 
may be excluded by budgetary limitations. For ex- 
ample, an economic analysis by Barrager et al. (1982) 
estimated the value of improved fuel information on 
Mount Hood National Forest to range from $0.02 per 
ha for general fire planning to $79 per ha for evaluation 
of complex postharvest alternatives, suggesting that 
high investment in detailed fuel inventory is best suited 
for high value or high risk sites. The relatively limited 
choices which remain do not reflect inadequate re- 
search efforts but rather the great natural diversity of 
forest conditions and history. Application of predictive 
equations within a double-sampling context may be an 
intermediate alternative, less costly than an inventory 
but providing increased precision compared to the 
estimates offered by the other choices. 
Methods 
Data were collected in two field seasons, 1989 and 
1992, in forests which met the criteria of no evident 
disturbance within 20 years (Sackett 1979). The 1989 
sampling was done on the ponderosa pine forest of the 
North Rim, Grand Canyon National Park, and the Bar 
M watershed, Coconino National Forest. The North 
Rim is closed to harvesting and grazing, while the Bar 
M area was selectively harvested in 1948 and is subject 
to grazing. Elevations ranged from 2200 to 2500 
meters on the North Rim and 2100 to 2300 meters at 
Bar M. Sedimentary soils (limestone) occur on the 
North Rim; basalt soils at Bar M. 
Fixed plots of 10 x 20 meters were randomly 
located by overlaying site maps with a grid and choos- 
ing random coordinates. Each point were located on 
the ground and used to fix the sample plot 30 meters 
away in a random direction. Acceptable plots were at 
least 10% forested and had no apparent recent distur- 
bance. Approximately 10% of the points were rejected 
due to recent fire or insufficient cover. All plots were 
within the ponderosa pine type. Measurements were 
taken on 33 North Rim plots and 11 Bar M plots. 
Woody fuels and litter and duff depth were inven- 
toried on each plot with three parallel 16 m planar 
bansects (Brown et al. 1982). Large woody fuels (1000 
hour class) were tallied along the full 16 m of each 
transect, while smaller woody fuels were tallied on 8 
m per transect and litter and duff depths were measured 
every 2 m. Tree measurements included species and 
diameter at breast height of all trees over 1.37 m. 
Height, crown length, and an increment core were 
measured on a 10% subsample of trees. Overstory type 
(mature, pole, seedling), canopy closure, slope, aspect, 
and elevation were also recorded. 
Preliminary analysis of the 1989 results indicated 
that several stand variables, including age, height, 
growth rate, and crown length, contributed less than 
stand density (basal area, trees per hectare, stand 
density index) to the explanation of fuel variation. 
Therefore additional data were collected in 1992 with 
a simplified method concentrating on stand density at 
a study site in the Gus Pearson Natural Area, Fort 
Valley Experimental Forest, Coconino National Forest. 
The Pearson site is closed to harvesting and grazing. 
Elevation at the site is 2200 to 2250 meters; soils are 
basaltic. Circular fixed plots of 10 meter diameter were 
randomly distributed within 3 overstory types: trees 
over 120 years, trees under 120 years, and small forest 
openings (50 to 150 m2) with few trees but containing 
woody fuels and pine litter from the surrounding forest. 
Measurements were taken on 56 Pearson plots. Tree 
measurements included species and diameter at breast 
height of all trees over 1.37 m. Fuels were inventoried 
with two perpendicular 5 m planar transects per plot. 
All woody fuels were tallied along the 5 m transects 
and litter and duff depths measured every meter. 
Overstory type and elevation were also recorded. 
For all sites, mean fuel loadings by size class per 
plot were calculated using the method of Brown (1974) 

- Double Sampling and Forest Floor Inventories for Arizona - 
5 
with southwestern ponderosa pine woody fuel average 
squared diameters and specific gravities (Sackett 1980). 
Mean litter and duff depths were calculated per plot. 
Stand characteristics calculated from diameter mea- 
surements included basal area (BA, m2/ha), trees per 
hectare (TPH), and quadratic mean diameter (QD, cm). 
Stand density index was calculated as SDI = TPH(QD1 
25.4)IM5 (McTague and Patton 1989). 
Regressions were developed with SYSTAT statis- 
tical software (Witkinson 1988). Logarithmic and 
weighted transforms, and indicator variables, were 
tested for improving the models. Residuals were 
examined for violation of regression assumptions. 
Models were validated by splitting the data set and 
comparing predicted mean square errors from models 
made with one set to ahe mean square error observed 
in applying the models to the other set (Snee 1977).

Results 
Since differences among sedimentary and basalt 
sites in Arizona have been observed in studies of 
ponderosa fuels (Ffolliott et al. 1968,1976; Sackett and 
Haase, 1991). multivariate analysis of variance 
(MANOVA) was chosen to examine the effect of site 
on the complete fuel and stand matrices. The alpha 
level for all statistical tests was 0.05. Following an 
overall determination of a statistically significant dif- 
ference among sites using the Wilk's lambda statistic, 
the MANOVA univariate F-values were examined for 
individual comparisons among fuel and stand vari- 
ables. The MANOVA indicated that overall fuel 
characteristics were significantly different between the 
sedimentary and basalt sites (Wilk's lambda = 0.705, 
p = 0.000). Forest floor depth, woody fuel loadings, 
and univariate F-test results are shown in Table 1. The 
MANOVA indicated that overall stand characteristics 
were also significantly different between the sedimen- 
tary and basalt sites (Wilk's lambda = 0.313, p= 0.000). 
Table 2 gives the stand characteristics and univariate 
F-test results. Despite the different sampling plot de- 
signs and past harvesting history on the two basalt sites, 
stand variables on these sites were not significantly 
different. The basalt fuel complexes were significantly 
different overall (Wilk's lambda = 0,684, p = 0.001) 
but the difference was probably due primarily to the 1- 
hour woody fuel class, since it was the only category 
found significantly different by the univariate F-test. 
Depth prediction equations for litter, duff, and the 
total forest floor are shown in Table 3. An indicator 
variable, SITE, which separated the basalt and sedi- 
mentary sites, was significant in the litter model. In 
general, stand variables were good predictors of forest 
floor depth but not of woody fuel loading, either by 
separate size classes or in total. However, different size 
classes of woody fuels were found to be strongly 
correlated with one another so that loading from one 
size class may be used to predict another. A series of 
relationships among the woody fuel classes is shown 
in Table 4. One hour fuel loading can be used to 
predict 10-hour loading (equation 4). Alternately, 100- 
hour fuel loading can be used to predict 1 and 10-hour 
loadings (equations 5 and 6). Finally, Table 4 shows 
relationships between the smaller fuel classes and total 
woody fuel loading. Equation 7 through 9 give three 
alternatives for predicting total woody fuel loading 
from 1-hour, 100-hour, and 1000-hour loading respec- 
tively. One data point was considered an outlier due 
to an extremely high 1000-hour fuel loading approxi- 
mately 8 standard deviations above the mean. It was 
excluded from the data set for models including 1000- 
hour fuels or total fuels only (equations 7 - 9 in Table 
4) because it had very high leverage, increasing f 
values to 0.99. 
The indicator variable SITE was 
significant in several of the woody fuel models.

Discussion 
Woody fuel loading results in Table 1 are similar 
to mean southwestern ponderosa pine loadings re- 
ported by Sackett (1979) in the 1 through 100-hour 
classes; heavy woody fuel loadings were 25% (sound 
fuels) to 50% (rotten fuels) of the southwestern aver- 
age. Higher variance was observed in fuel and stand 
variables on basalt sites than on sedimentary sites. This 
difference may be due to the change in sample plot 
layout, stand history between the formerly-harvested 
Bar M site and the unharvested Pearson site, or inherent 
productivity differences. Compared to Ffolliott et al.'s 
(1968) equation for forest floor depth, equation 3 in 
Table 3 is significantly different (t-test, p < 0.05) in 
slope and intercept. However, the study site of Ffolliott 
et al. (1968) did not meet the criterion of 20 or more 
years free from disturbance applied by Sackett (1979) 
and in the present study. 
Litter, duff, and forest floor depths may be calcu- 
lated from timber inventory data for sites with appro- 
priate physical and stand history characteristics using

the equations in Table 3. Woody fuel estimates using 
the models in Table 4 require the addition of a planar 
transect to each field inventory plot, increasing the 
complexity and cost of the procedure. 
However, 
because a tally of planar intersections of as few as one 
woody fuel size class could be sufficient for manage- 
ment needs, the planar transect inventory could be 
simpler and faster than a complete sample of all woody 
fuel classes (Brown et al. 1982). For example, a tally 
of 100-hour fuels along a 5 m transect, with subsequent 
prediction of 1-hour, 10-hour, and total woody fuel 
loading using equations in Table 4, is expected to be 
less costly than a complete tally along a 15 m transect. 
The woody fuel class of primary interest should be 
chosen for sampling on the planar transect. Estimates 
of additional fuels generated from current or planned 
management activities could be added to the sampled 
or predicted natural fuel loadings (Puckett et al. 1979), 
although variance could increase greatly. While the 
precision of estimates from the equations in Tables 3 
and 4 is likely to be low given the relatively low 1.2 
values and high standard errors shown, the explanatory 
power of the equations is comparable to that of similar 
equations previously reported, if indeed variability 
permitted any to be made (Ffolliott et al. 1968 and 
1976, Sackett 1979, Brown and See 1981). The higher 
explanatory power of the equations developed by 
Sackett and Haase (1991), on the other hand, reflects 
the detailed sampling stratification and combination of 
duff, litter, and woody fuels under 2.54 cm diameter 
fuel classes into a single total fuel loading value. 
The precision of estimates from the equations in 
Tables 3 and 4 would be enhanced by applying them 
in a double sampling context, as is often done in scales 
ranging from that of remote sensing (e.g., Paine 1981) 
to that of individual organisms (e.g., Andariese and 
Covington 1986). Double sampling methods are widely 
used in the U.S. for estimation of herbaceous and litter 
fuels (Brown et al. 1982) and other vegetation sampling 
(Francis et al. 1979). Double sampling in fuel estima- 
tion rests upon a theoretical foundation of allometry, 
the mathematical and functional interrelationships of 
the growth and structure of organism components (e.g., 
the relationship between canopy mass and sapwood 
area, Grier and Waring 1974). Although most allomet- 
ric studies have been conducted at the individual 
organism level, others have explored ecosystem level 
allometry (including litterfall and dead organic accu- 
mulations, e.g., Olson 1963, Covington 1981). Two 
facts suggest that allometry might serve as a foundation 
for improved understanding of forest floor and down 
woody biomass interrelationships. First, litterfall com- 
ponents are functionally related to plant biomass com- 
ponents (Kercher and Axelrod 1984, Keane et al. 

- Double Sampling and Forest Floor Inventories for Arizona - 
7 
1990), and second, the balance between litterfall pro- 
duction and decomposition varies with litterfall dimen- 
sions (Harmon et al. 1986). Thus it might be possible 
to develop useful allometric relations among woody 
litter and forest floor components as well as with live 
tree measurements. In this manner one could use 
detailed inventory on one or more of the components 
and extrapolate using allometric equations for the 
others. 
In the present case, fuel information may be ob- 
tained from timber inventory for a relatively small 
extra cost. Taking a subsample or "double" sample of 
fuel measurements on some of the timber inventory 
points will improve the precision of the fuel estimate, 
give the manager control over confidence limits and the 
desired sampling error, and allow calculation of the 
cost of fuel information. An example is discussed 
below for estimation of duff depth. Analogous meth- 
ods may be used for the other models in Tables 3 and 
4. 
Estimates of duff depth on suitable sites can be 
made from a timber inventory based on variable radius 
sample points by computing basal area and applying 
equation 1 from Table 3. 
Stratifying duff depth 
estimates by established timber strata will give less 
variable results and allow the manager to map fuels by 
stand boundaries. If duff depth is measured on a 
random subset of inventory plots, a double sampling 
regression estimate of the mean duff depths may be 
calculated. An illustrative data set was developed by 
measuring basal area on 100 variable-radius sample 
points (N = 100) on a 200 ha ponderosa pine site with 
natural fuels within the Fort Valley Experimental 
Forest, Coconino National Forest. Duff depth at each 
sample point was calculated using equation 1. Duff 
depth was measured at 1 m intervals along a random- 
direction 5 m msect at a randomly-selected 30 of the 
100 points (n = 30 double sampled points). The 
average duff depth was computed at each double 
sample point. Figure 1 shows the 30 predicted and 
observed duff depth pairs. Calibration through linear 
regression of observed depth (y) on predicted depth (x) 
gives: 
Y, =Y+b(x,-TI) 
= 2.953 + 1.296(xi - 3.355) r = .744 
(10) 
where: y = mean observed duff depth on the double 
- sample points 
x = mean predicted duff depth on the double 
sampling points 
b = slope of regression line 
r = correlation coefficient 
Due to the variability observed in the data, the least- 
squares regression curve does not pass through the 
origin as might be expected with a more highly precise 
estimator. Nonetheless, the correlation between the 
observed and predicted values is the basis for applying 
double sampling to reduce variance (Francis et al. 
1979). As long as some correlation exists, double 
sampling will always reduce variance compared to 
simple random sampling of a given number of field 
sampling points (deVries 1986). 
The estimated population mean duff depth Y is now 
calculated by substituting X for xi in equation 10 above: 
and the estimated variance of Y is (de Vries 1986): 
var(?) = s t  [n-I - (N - n)(?)/(Nn)] 
= (1.907)[30-' - (100 - 30)(0.553)/(100)(30)] 
= 0.0390 
(1 1) 
where: sy2 = variance of observed duff depth 
N = large sample 
n = double sample 
The double_sampling standard error of the mean, 
s(y) = [var(Y)IoJ = 0.1974, is approximately 22% 
less than the standard error of the mean from the 30 
samples, s(fl = [sy2/nIo5 = 0.2521. The double 
sampling estimator of the mean therefore is more 
precise: taking the 90% confidence interval with 
to.,,loo=1.67, the double sampling estimate is 
- 
Y =2.864+0.330 while the 90% confidence interval 
with g,,,, = 1.70 around the 30 sampled points is 
3=2.953 k 0.429. 
Cost information will now be included to determine 
the best ratio of predicted to observed points and the 
relative efficiency of the sampling scheme. If the 
example data in Figure 1 were from a preliminary 
survey, an optimal number of sample and subsample 
points could be calculated to reach an estimate of 
specified precision at minimal cost. Assume that the 
cost of predicting duff depth from basal area data is C. 
This value is the cost of applying equation 1 to a data 
set and should be trivial (for example, $0.01 per point). 
Then estimate the marginal cost of measuring duff 
depth along with a basal area inventory in the field. 
This cost, c, is the extra cost of taking a duff measure- 
ment (for example, $1.50 per plot to measure the duff 
in 5 places and average). The cost of the basal area 
inventory itself is not included. The optimum ratio, R, 
of predicted duff points to measured duff points in a 
double sampling scheme, using the example cost and 
9values, is pahe 1981):

meaning that the double sample of duff depth should be 
taken on approximately 14% of all variable radius inven- 
tory points. 
The efficiency, E, of this double sample is a 
dimensionless number used to compare different double 
sample schemes. In general, the higher the correlation 
between the predicted and observed values (equation 
(lo)), the higher the efficiency (Paine 1981). Using 
values from the example, the efficiency is (Paine 
1981): 
where: E = efficiency of the double sample; other 
variables are as in (12) above. 
The number of double sample field points n, re- 
quired for an estimate with a specified percent sam- 
pling error at a given confidence level can now be 
determined. Calculate the coefficient of variation of 
duff depth from the field plots ([S~~]~~/Y). 
Choose the 
desired sampling error DSE (for example, 10% of the 
mean) and t value for the confidence level (90% 
confidence, t = 1.67). Applying the example and R and 
E values calculated above, the calculation is (Paine 
1981): 
where: n,

and the number of prediction points, np, is (R)(nJ = 
409. Total cost for the duff depth information is 
(409)($0.01) + (30)($1.50) = $49.09. To achieve the 
same precision with field sampling alone, the number 
of points required is: 
costing $93.00 or 89% more. The costs of prediction 
and observation may appear difficult to estimate prior 
to application of the method, but the number of field 
observation points is rather insensitive to a range of 
costs. In the example above, reducing the field mea- 
surement cost, c, to $0.50 gives n, = 32, while increas- 
ing the cost to $3.00 gives n, = 29. For comparison, 
current compensation to U.S. Forest Service contrac- 
tors for stand examination inventory based on variable- 
radius sampling in the Southwest is approximately 
$8.00 to $14.00 per point (William F. Stansfield, 
personal communication 1993). Further analysis in a 
particular management situation could explore the ef- 
fects of other fuel measurements, sensitivity to confi- 
dence level changes, and comparison to the cost of a 
dedicated fuel inventory. 
Extending the analysis beyond the natural Arizona 
ponderosa pine fuels in this study, the double sampling 
approach could prove useful with other predictive 
equations or in other geographic areas or forest types 
where predictive methods are available. Predictions 
need not be based on equations; any method which 
results in correlation between predicted and observed 
values may be useful if the cost of obtaining the 
predicted (auxiliary) variable is sufficiently low com- 
pared to the cost of direct sampling. For instance, the 
common double sampling application of weight esti- 
mation of herbaceous production depends on ocular 
estimates for prediction (Francis et al. 1979). The 
detailed example worked out in this study is intended 
to clarify the method and assist managers in design and 
nalysis of double sampling schemes for fuel invento- 
ries. 
Conclusion 
Since information on forest floor characteristics can 
be expensive or difficult to obtain, the ability to predict 
these characteristics from limited data would be useful 
to managers. Even under the constraints of reduced 
disturbance and small plot size followed in this study, 
a great deal of variation was observed in natural 
ponderosa pine forest floors with no disturbance within 
20 years on sedimentary and basalt soils in northern 
and central Arizona. However, the allometric relation- 
ships between forest stand characteristics and litter and 
duff depth, as well as among the different woody fuel 
size classes, can be applied to create predictive equa- 
tions for these site. These equations are not precise due 
to high variability in fuels and stand characteristics, but 
when used with double sampling the combination gives 
equivalent results at reduced cost compared to field 
sampling alone. In regions or fuel types where other 
predictive relationships exist, they may be applied in 
analogous fashion. Investment can be further con- 
trolled by adjusting the confidence level and desired 
sampling error to reflect the relative values-at-risk and 
fire hazard in different sampled areas. The method 
described here is not a comprehensive plan for fuel 
inventory; rather it is intended to expand the alterna- 
tives available to managers who must make decisions 
under conditions of high variability and limited re- 
sources.
