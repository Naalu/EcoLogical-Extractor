Abstract
Fire regime characteristics of high-elevation forests on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, Arizona, were re-
constructed from ﬁre scar analysis, remote sensing, tree age, and forest structure measurements, a ﬁrst attempt at
detailed reconstruction of the transition from surface to stand-replacing ﬁre patterns in the Southwest. Tree den-
sities and ﬁre-/non-ﬁre-initiated groups were highly mixed over the landscape, so distinct ﬁre-created stands could
not be delineated from satellite imagery or the oldest available aerial photos. Surface ﬁres were common from
1700 to 1879 in the 4,400 ha site, especially on S and W aspects. Fire dates frequently coincided with ﬁre dates
measured at study sites at lower elevation, suggesting that pre-1880 ﬁre sizes may have been very large. Large
ﬁres, those scarring 25% or more of the sample trees, were relatively infrequent, averaging 31 years between
burns. Four of the ﬁve major regional ﬁre years occurred in the 1700s, followed by a 94-year gap until 1879.
Fires typically occurred in signiﬁcantly dry years (Palmer Drought Stress Index), with severe drought in major
regional ﬁre years. Currently the forest is predominantly spruce-ﬁr, mixed conifer, and aspen. In contrast, den-
droecological reconstruction of past forest structure showed that the forest in 1880 was very open, corresponding
closely with historical (1910) accounts of severe ﬁres leaving partially denuded landscapes. Age structure and
species composition were used to classify sampling points into ﬁre-initiated and non-ﬁre-initiated groups. Tree
groups on nearly 60% of the plots were ﬁre-initiated; the oldest such groups appeared to have originated after
severe ﬁres in 1782 or 1785. In 1880, all ﬁre-initiated groups were less than 100 years old and nearly 25% of the
groups were less than 20 years old. Non-ﬁre-initiated groups were signiﬁcantly older (oldest 262 years in 1880),
dominated by ponderosa pine, Douglas-ﬁr, or white ﬁr, and occurred preferentially on S and W slopes. The
mixed-severity ﬁre regime, transitioning from lower-elevation surface ﬁres to mixed surface and stand-replacing
ﬁre at higher elevations, appeared not to have been stable over the temporal and spatial scales of this study.
Information about historical ﬁre regime and forest structure is valuable for managers but the information is prob-
ably less speciﬁc and stable for high-elevation forests than for low-elevation ponderosa pine forests.
Introduction
The concept of ﬁre severity, the effects of a ﬁre on
biota, is distressingly qualitative (Johnson and Miya-
nishi 2001) but very useful for ecologists and manag-
ers. Deﬁning severity in terms of survival of domi-
nant trees, the extremes are low-severity ﬁre regimes
where most trees survive (e.g., surface ﬁres in pon-
derosa pine; Swetnam and Baisan 1996) and high-se-
verity ﬁre regimes in which most perish, initiating a
new stand (e.g., crown ﬁres in jack pine; Heinsel-
mann 1973). In the southwestern USA, low- and

high-severity ﬁre regimes are often found in close
proximity on steep elevational gradients. Grissino-
Mayer et al. (1995) found frequent ﬁre occurrence
(mean ﬁre interval [MFI] of 6.2 years) in an Arizona
mixed conifer forest located below a spruce-ﬁr stand
that had not burned in > 300 years. In a similar ex-
ample of abrupt differences in ﬁre regime over a short
distance, Stephens (2001) in California reported a
MFI of 9 years in a Jeffrey pine stand and nearly 25
years in a ﬁr-dominated stand located only 100 m
away. The nature of the transition between low- and
high-severity ﬁre is poorly understood. A moderate-
severity ﬁre regime, intermediate in mortality, may
exist in some circumstances (Agee 1993). However,
heterogeneity in aspect, slope, and elevation at ﬁne
scales can inﬂuence differences in vegetation and fuel
moisture, leading to topographically distinct burning
patterns (Beaty and Taylor 2001). This alternative is
a mixed-severity ﬁre regime, where forest patches af-
fected by low- and high-severity burning are closely
juxtaposed.
The never-harvested forest on the North Rim of
Grand Canyon National Park is an ideal site to mea-
sure ﬁre regime transition. Frequent surface ﬁres
burned throughout ponderosa pine and lower mixed
conifer forests of the canyon’s North Rim on the
Kaibab Plateau until disruption of the ﬁre regime
circa 1880 (Wolf and Mast 1998; Fulé et al. 2000 and
in press). At higher elevation, White and Vankat
(1993) used tree age data to show increased spruce-
ﬁr forest density since 1880. The North Rim has
never been harvested and livestock grazing was ex-
cluded around 1938, affording a unique opportunity
to assess forests over an elevational gradient in a
near-natural setting (Fulé et al. 2002 and in press).
The appropriate sampling methods in a setting
where ﬁre regimes include both surface and canopy
burning are a combination of ﬁre-scar dates, age
structure, and species composition of ﬁre-initiated
stands (Johnson and Gutsell 1994). All these ap-
proaches have strengths and limitations. Fire scars are
precisely dated but they represent points on the land-
scape; age and species data are constrained by impre-
cision in stand boundaries, ﬁre survivors within
stands, imprecision of tree establishment date, imme-
diacy of post-ﬁre colonization, and interpretation of
successional pathways (Johnson and Gutsell 1994;
Swetnam and Baisan 1996; Swetnam et al. 1999;
Baker and Ehle 2001). Recent studies in forests with
mixed burning patterns have emphasized different as-
pects of methodological certainty. For instance,
Kipfmueller and Baker (2000) calculated ﬁre rotation
(FR, the time required to burn an area equivalent to
100% of the study site), MFI, and mean point ﬁre in-
tervals (a per-tree measure of average intervals be-
tween ﬁre scars) in a Wyoming lodgepole pine forest,
suggesting that the composite MFI overestimated ﬁre
occurrence. Minnich et al. (2000) reconstructed twen-
tieth century ﬁre history in a Baja California mixed
conifer forest from aerial photography, arguing that
infrequent, severe ﬁres regulated forest structure,
rather than the more-frequent surface ﬁres detected
from ﬁre scars. Taylor (2000) suggested a closer in-
tegration between MFI and FR data along a gradient
from low-elevation Jeffrey pine to high-elevation
mesic forests by showing that the mean point ﬁre in-
terval (i.e., ﬁre interval on a per-sample basis) corre-
sponded closely with FR values.
We applied multiple methods (ﬁre scars, tree age
and species, spatial patterns of forest stands) to mea-
sure spatial and temporal patterns of ﬁre on the North
Rim. Our ﬁrst objective was to reconstruct ﬁre regime
characteristics across the transition from surface to
stand-replacing ﬁres, asking:
1. Did ﬁre occurrence differ by aspect, elevation, and
forest type at high elevation?
2. Were ﬁre events synchronized between low-eleva-
tion and high-elevation sites?
3. Could severe ﬁres be identiﬁed by detecting ﬁre-
initiated tree groups using remote sensing, tree
age, or species composition data?
The second objective was to compare current for-
est conditions with forest structure at the onset of ﬁre
exclusion, circa 1880, asking:
1. What is the accuracy of forest reconstruction,
compared with historical data?
2. What are the implications of forest structural
change for future management?
Methods
Study area
Two sites were studied. The larger site was the upper
mixed conifer and spruce-ﬁr forests covering 
4,400 ha at Little Park, comprising the highest eleva-
tions on the Kaibab Plateau, up to 2,794 m (Figure 1).
The Little Park site lay to the east of previously sam-
466

pled study sites (Fulé et al. 2002) ranging from Pow-
ell Plateau (PP), Fire Point (FP), and Rainbow Plateau
(RP), each at  2,300 m elevation, through Swamp
Ridge (  2,500 m) (Figure 1). These sites are ar-
ranged west–east on an elevational gradient along the
northern border of Grand Canyon National Park, per-
mitting the comparison of ﬁre regimes over the gra-
dient. However, the prevailing summer winds are
from the southwest, so ﬁres might not necessarily be
expected to burn from the low-elevation sites into
Little Park. Therefore we added a second study site,
Galahad Point, at the base of Kanabownits Canyon
( 2,350 m elevation) (Figure 1). The 410-ha Gala-
had site lay directly downcanyon and upwind (i.e.,
SW) from Little Park, so ﬁres at Galahad would be
expected to burn toward Little Park. Adding the Gala-
had site allowed us to test whether ﬁre dates differed
among low-elevation sites southwest vs. due west of
the high-elevation site.
Average annual precipitation at the North Rim
ranger station (elevation 2,542 m) is 58 cm, with an
average annual snowfall of 328 cm. Temperatures
range from an average July maximum of 26 °C to an
average January minimum of −2 °C (White and
Vankat 1993). Soil information was derived from an
ongoing soil survey (A. Dewall, National Resource
Conservation
Service,
personal
communication
2002). Soils at the Galahad site were Typic Paleust-
alfs. At the Little Park site, soil textures ranged from
coarse to ﬁne loams. Valley soils at the Little Park site
were Cumulic Haplustolls, soils on 15–40% slopes
Figure 1. Study sites on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park. From west to east, sites are Powell Plateau (PP), Fire Point (FP),
Rainbow Plateau (RP), Swamp Ridge (SR), Galahad Point, and Little Park. Forest structure and ﬁre regimes of the ﬁrst four sites were
described by Fulé et al. (2002 and in press). Galahad and Little Park are described in this study. Symbols scattered across the study sites
indicate locations of ﬁre-scarred sample trees. Large triangles are trees that were scarred by ﬁre in 1785. Smaller circles are trees not scarred
in 1785. The contour interval is 100 m.

were Oxyaquic Paleustalfs, and ﬂatter upland areas
(2–15% slopes) were Cumulic Haplustolls.
Forests in the Galahad study site were dominated
by ponderosa pine with Gambel oak and New Mexi-
can locust (scientiﬁc names and species codes are
given in Table 1). At Little Park, tree species included
ponderosa pine, aspen, white ﬁr, and subalpine ﬁr.
Engelmann and blue spruce were combined in this
study because of difficulties in distinguishing young
trees (Moore and Huffman (unpublished)) and our
observation of trees at the study site that had charac-
teristics intermediate between the two species. For the
remainder of this paper, species codes are used to re-
fer to individual tree species (e.g., PIPO), while
names of dominant tree species are used to refer to
vegetation types (e.g., spruce-ﬁr vegetation type).
Field sampling
Fire-scarred trees were sampled in 2000 and 2001 to
obtain an inventory of ﬁre dates from scarred trees
distributed across the study sites (Swetnam and Bai-
san 1996). The Galahad study site (410 ha) was sys-
tematically surveyed along parallel transects to search
100% of the site. At the much larger Little Park site
(4,400 ha), ﬁre-scarred trees were encountered pre-
dominantly on ridgetops and SW-S-SE aspects. These
topographic features were completely traversed for
sample
collection.
In
addition,
representative
transects were sampled across northern aspects on
each ridge. Trees with the longest and most complete
ﬁre records were selected, an example of targeted
sampling (Baker and Ehle 2001). Samples were
mapped when collected and were well-distributed
throughout the study areas (Figure 1).
Forest sampling was carried out at the Little Park
site. In many forests, sampling can be stratiﬁed by
even-aged patches originating from ﬁre (e.g., Johnson
and Gutsell 1994). The ﬁrst step was to attempt to
identify such stands across the study area using cur-
rent and the oldest available aerial photographs
(1956), vegetation maps (Warren et al. 1982), data
from adjacent stands (White and Vankat 1993), and
ﬁeld surveys. However, all these sources of informa-
tion showed that forest structure at Little Park was
highly diverse, suggesting a mixture of surface ﬁre
together with ﬁre-initiated groups or patches that may
have contained many ﬁre survivors. Therefore we
sampled on a systematic grid to capture forest age
structure and species composition proportional to oc-
currence.
Sixty sampling plot centers were located system-
atically on a 600 m (E–W) by 1,200 m (N–S) grid.
The shorter grid distance was chosen in order to mea-
sure with greater sampling density along the prevail-
ing elevational gradient, roughly E–W. Vegetation
was measured on plots based on the National Park
Service’s Fire Monitoring plots (Reeberg 1995), with
modiﬁcations to collect detailed tree condition and
dendroecological data. This plot design was chosen to
correspond with NPS monitoring and because the rel-
atively large plots are useful for capturing variability
of clumps of old trees (Fulé et al. 1997). Sampling
plots were 0.1 ha (20 × 50 m) in size, oriented with
the 50-m sides uphill-downhill to maximize sampling
of variability along the elevational gradient and to
permit correction of the plot area for slope. Plots were
permanently marked to permit re-measurements in
the future. Iron stakes were sunk ﬂush to the forest
ﬂoor at the corners and center of each plot and a large
tree was tagged with the distance and bearing to the
plot center. Photos were taken at the corners and quar-
ter-corners of each plot.

Trees larger than 15 cm diameter at breast height
(dbh) were measured on the entire plot (1000 m2) and
trees between 2.5–15 cm dbh were measured on one
quarter-plot (250 m2); all trees were tagged. Tree at-
tributes measured were: species, dbh, height, crown
base height, dwarf mistletoe rating (0–6, Hawksworth
and Geils (1990)), and tree condition. To assess
changes in forest structure, we differentiated between
trees established prior to 1880 and those that estab-
lished later. Previous research in northern Arizona
showed that ponderosa pines with dbh > 37.5 cm or
ponderosa of any size with yellowed bark could be
conservatively identiﬁed in the ﬁeld as being of pre-
1880 origin (White 1985; Mast et al. 1999). We used
the same diameter breakpoint, 37.5 cm, for other co-
nifers (Fulé et al. 2002) and > 20 cm for aspen trees.
Conservative identiﬁcation meant that these criteria
included all pre-1880 trees as well as numerous post-
1880 trees. Tree status (pre/post 1880) was later cor-
rected in the laboratory using age data. All living trees
meeting the ﬁeld criteria above were considered po-
tentially pre-1880 trees and were cored. A random
10% sample of all trees that did not meet the ﬁeld
criteria was also cored. Coring height was 40 cm
above ground level. This height was chosen to meet
two objectives: ﬁrst, to measure tree age, and second,
to measure growth between the ﬁre regime disruption
date and the present (needed for the forest reconstruc-
tion). The two objectives conﬂict because the best
coring height for age is ground level, but the butt
swell and irregular growth around the root collar
make this an inappropriate height for growth mea-
surement. The 40-cm height is a compromise, the
lowest position on the bole where consistent tree form
allows a good measurement of growth. Seedling trees,
those below 2.5 cm dbh, were tallied by species, con-
dition, and height class in a 50 m2 subplot. Canopy
cover measured by vertical projection (Ganey and
Block 1994) was recorded at 30 cm intervals along
the two 50-m sidelines of each plot.
Laboratory methods
Fire scars
Samples were mounted on plywood backing and sur-
faced with sandpaper to 400 grit. Tree rings were
crossdated (Stokes and Smiley 1968) with marker
years listed in Fulé et al. (2002). Dates were indepen-
dently conﬁrmed by another dendrochronologist or
ring widths were measured and dating was checked
with the Cofecha software (Holmes 1983). Following
the procedure of Baisan and Swetnam (1990), the sea-
son of ﬁre was estimated based on the relative posi-
tion of ﬁre injury within the annual ring according to
the following categories: EE (early earlywood), ME
(middle earlywood), LE (late earlywood), L (late-
wood), and D (dormant). Dormant season scars were
assigned to the year of the following earlywood (i.e.,
spring ﬁres).
Data were analyzed with FHX2 software (Grissi-
no-Mayer 2001). Analysis at each site began with the
ﬁrst ﬁre year with an adequate sample depth, deﬁned
as 10% or more of the total sample size of recording
trees at each site (Grissino-Mayer et al. 1995). Re-
cording trees are those with open ﬁre scars or other
injuries (e.g., lightning scars), leaving them suscep-
tible to repeated scarring by ﬁre (Dieterich and Swet-
nam 1984). At Galahad, the ﬁrst year of ﬁre regime
analysis was 1744; at Little Park the ﬁrst year was
1700. Statistical summaries of ﬁre occurrence data
included the mean ﬁre interval, median, and Weibull
median probability interval (Grissino-Mayer 1999),
minimum/maximum ﬁre-free intervals, and standard
deviation. Comparison of data across different-sized
study sites could be biased because more scars re-
cording small ﬁres are likely to be included in larger
study sites (Agee 1993; Swetnam and Baisan 1996).
The practice of proportional ﬁltering of the data set
provides a reasonably consistent basis of comparison
by removing small ﬁre events that scarred only one
or a few trees (Swetnam and Baisan 1996; Baker and
Ehle 2001). Our ﬁre data were ﬁltered to look at three
levels of progressively higher proportions of scarring.
First, all ﬁre years, even those represented by a single
scar, were considered. Then only those ﬁre years were
included in which respectively 10% or more, and
25% or more, of the recording samples were scarred.
Finally, we also calculated the per-sample or point
ﬁre frequency, suggested by Baker and Ehle (2001)
as another approach for consistent comparisons be-
tween study areas. This interval was calculated from
the ﬁrst to last ﬁre date, not from the pith date.
The relationship between climatic ﬂuctuations and
ﬁre occurrence was evaluated with superposed epoch
analysis (SEA), using software developed by Grissi-
no-Mayer et al. (1995). A locally developed tree-ring
chronology served as a proxy for climate (19 ponde-
rosa pine trees from Powell Plateau, Rainbow Pla-
teau, and Fire Point, master series 1559–1997, series
intercorrelation = 0.70, average mean sensitivity =
0.34). The chronology was signiﬁcantly correlated
with reconstructed Palmer Drought Stress Index (r =
469

0.67) for grid point 31 in northern Arizona, A.D.
1694–1978 (Cook et al. 1996). The SEA superim-
poses all ﬁre years and mathematically summarizes
the climate data for ﬁre years, as well as a window of
5 preceding and 5 succeeding years. Bootstrapped
distributions of climate data in 1000 random windows
were used to create conﬁdence intervals.
From 1924 onward, Grand Canyon National Park
maintained records of ﬁre occurrence. After determin-
ing ﬁre dates on ﬁre-scarred samples, we compared
the tree-ring ﬁre history against the recorded ﬁre his-
tory.
Forest structure
Forest plot area was corrected for slope by multiply-
ing the 50-m dimension by the slope correction fac-
tor. Tree increment cores were surfaced and visually
crossdated (Stokes and Smiley 1968) with tree-ring
chronologies we developed. Rings were counted on
cores that could not be crossdated, especially younger
trees. Additional years to the center were estimated
with a pith locator (concentric circles matched to the
curvature and density of the inner rings) for cores that
missed the pith (Applequist 1958). From previous
studies (Fulé et al., 2000, 2002 and in press), we
know that ﬁre exclusion began after 1879 on most of
the North Rim. Forest structure in 1880 was recon-
structed using dendroecological methods (Fulé et al.
1997) as follows: tree size at the time of ﬁre exclu-
sion was reconstructed by subtracting the radial
growth measured on increment cores since 1879. We
developed local species-speciﬁc relationships be-
tween tree diameter and basal area increment (r2 =
0.45 to 0.90) and applied these relationships to esti-
mate past size for trees without increment cores (dead
or rotten centers). For dead trees, the date of death
was estimated based on tree condition class using di-
ameter-dependent snag decomposition rates (Thomas
et al. 1979). A total of 4,719 trees were present on
the plots in 1880; of this number, 3,153 trees or 67%
are still living. The accuracy of the dendroecological
reconstruction methods is assessed in Changes in for-
est structure, below.
Fire-initiated/non-ﬁre-initiated plots
We were unable to use remotely sensed data or ﬁeld
reconnaissance to identify homogeneous stands of
trees originating after ﬁre, as noted above. However,
at the ﬁner scale of the 20 × 50-m plots we were able
to detect differences associated with effects of ﬁres of
differing severity. Fire-initiated and non-ﬁre-initiated
plots were distinguished by age and species compo-
sition data, following methods similar to Murray et
al. (1998). In some sense, all forests on the North Rim
might be considered ﬁre initiated, because of ﬁre’s
importance in regeneration (e.g., White 1985), but the
terminology is used here to separate groups of trees
that originated following a stand-replacing ﬁre from
trees that established as individuals or small cohorts
under an overstory of ﬁre-resistant trees. All age co-
horts within each plot were taken into consideration
but the greatest weight was given to the oldest trees.
When the oldest tree or trees were the ﬁre-resistant
species PIPO and PSME, the plot was classiﬁed as
non-ﬁre-initiated. When the oldest trees were the ﬁre-
susceptible species POTR, PIEN, or ABLA, the plot
was classiﬁed as ﬁre-initiated. ABCO was considered
intermediate in ﬁre resistance and old-ABCO plots
were classiﬁed as non-ﬁre-initiated when accompa-
nied by uneven-aged PIPO or PSME, and as ﬁre-ini-
tiated when accompanied by approximately equal-
aged
POTR.
In
general,
the
non-ﬁre-initiated
classiﬁcation corresponded to uneven-aged struc-
ture, but the ﬁre-initiated classiﬁcation was not inter-
preted as even-aged—plots with ﬁre-susceptible old
trees often had one or more cohorts of younger trees,
a category called mixed severity by Murray et al.
(1998).
Remote sensing
Vegetation at the Little Park study area was classiﬁed
from satellite imagery (Landsat Enhanced Thematic
Mapper image, acquired 6 June 2000) in order to
compare topographic characteristics (slope, aspect, el-
evation) with vegetation type. The classiﬁcation
scheme was designed under the National Vegetation
Classiﬁcation Standards (NVCS) framework (USGS
[United States Geological Survey] 2000). The plot
data were used as training sites for image classiﬁca-
tion. The species label for each training site was ’im-
portance value’ (Taylor 2000), calculated as the sum
of the relative frequency (percent stems) and relative
abundance (percent basal area) for each species. This
approach was similar to the classiﬁcation method
used by White and Vankat (1993) on an adjacent
study area, but differed in that we chose to include
aspen as a distinct forest type, because of its preva-
lence in the study area and importance in assessing
post-ﬁre succession, and we did not differentiate the
two spruce species. Four forest types were used in
this study: aspen, mixed conifer, ponderosa pine, and
470

spruce-ﬁr. A non-forested grass type was also identi-
ﬁed.
Results
Fire scar data
Galahad point
Fire history was reconstructed for the period 1744–
2000 from 31 ﬁre-scarred trees (Figure 2). Fires oc-
curred frequently until 1879; only one scar occurred
after 1879 (1954). The following statistics apply to
the 1744–1879 period: the mean ﬁre interval (MFI)
calculated from all ﬁre scars was 4.0 years (Table 2).
The Weibull median probability interval (WMPI) for
the same data was 3.6 years. For ﬁres scarring 25%
or more of the samples, average ﬁre intervals in-
creased by approximately 70% to MFI = 6.8 years,
WMPI = 6.1 years. The minimum ﬁre-free interval
was 1 year, maximum 12 years, rising to 2 and 18
years, respectively, under the 25%-scarred ﬁlter. The
mean point (or per-sample) ﬁre interval was 11.3
years (minimum 6.5 years, maximum 20.3 years).
The season of ﬁre occurrence was determined on
approximately 75% of the ﬁre scars. Over 85% of the
scars occurred in the middle earlywood to latewood;
dormant season scars accounted for < 5%. Fire years
in which 25% or more of the samples were scarred
matched 11 of the 17 major ﬁre years in which ﬁres
burned at 3 or all 4 of the sites previously studied on
the North Rim transect (Table 3, see Figure 1 for
Figure 2. Fire chart for 31 ﬁre-scarred trees from the Galahad study site. Horizontal lines represent the time period of each scarred sample
tree; vertical bars are ﬁres. Years in which ﬁres scarred 10% or more of the samples are shown on the lower axis.

study sites). Superposed epoch analysis showed that
ﬁre years were signiﬁcantly dry (Figure 4). The year
preceding ﬁre tended to be relatively wet but the
proxy climate variable did not exceed the 90% con-
ﬁdence interval (Figure 3).
Contemporary ﬁre records for the Galahad Point
area (410-ha study site buffered by 1 km to allow for
imprecision in recorded ﬁre locations) contained 40
lightning-caused ﬁres between 1936 and 1990. A
3.3-ha wildﬁre, the Bedivere ﬁre, burned in 1954 and
was detected in the tree-ring ﬁre history. However, the
largest ﬁre that burned within the sampling area was
the 12-ha Bedivere ﬁre in 1990 (ﬁres were often
named for nearby map features so names commonly
reappeared from year to year); this ﬁre was not de-
tected in the tree-ring ﬁre history. All other wildﬁres
were 3.7 ha or less, most commonly recorded as 0.04
ha, the minimum reporting size. All wildﬁres were
suppressed until 1986, when a lightning ignition was
allowed to burn, reaching 1.2 ha in size. Taking re-
cent years as the most reliable period of record
(1967–1996), 25 lightning ﬁres or 0.8 lightning ﬁres/
year occurred.
Little Park
Fire history was reconstructed for the period 1700–
2000 from 132 ﬁre-scarred trees (Figure 4). Scarred
trees were predominantly encountered on S aspects
(53%) followed by W (23%) and E (19%) aspects.
Only 5% of samples were collected from N-facing
slopes. A number of additional scarred samples were
collected but could not be crossdated conﬁdently, due
to complacent ring series (wide rings that do not
cross-match well with climate-induced narrow rings
in other trees).
In a similar pattern to the other North Rim sites,
ﬁres ceased after 1879 with only two subsequent ﬁre
dates: 1893 (one scarred sample) and 1921 (two
scarred samples). The following statistics apply to the
1700–1879 period. The all-scars MFI and WMPI
showed the highest ﬁre frequency of any North Rim
site, 2.6 and 2.3 years, respectively (Table 2). In con-

trast, applying the 25%-scarred ﬁlter led to the long-
est ﬁre-free intervals, MFI = 31.0 years and WMPI =
23.4 years, an increase of approximately 900–1100%
over the all-scar intervals. The change in minimum
and maximum ﬁre-free years among the different ﬁre
categories was also striking: for all scars, the mini-
mum ﬁre-free interval was 1 year and the maximum
was 12 years, identical to the Galahad site. But for
the 25%-scarred category, the minimum interval rose
to 11 years and the maximum to 94 years (1785 to
1879). The mean point ﬁre interval was 31.9 years
(minimum 8.9 years, maximum 99.0 years), nearly
three times as long as the Galahad mean point ﬁre in-
terval.
Using the forest data measured at the Little Park
site, the ﬁre-scarred samples were subdivided by the
forest type, aspect, and elevation, taking the 10%-
scarred ﬁlter as a standard of comparison (Table 2).
For the entire data set, with the 10%-scarred ﬁlter,
MFI = 8.0 years and WMPI = 6.8 years. Differences
were relatively minor among the subdivided groups.
By forest type, the MFI values for the 10%-scarred
groups ranged from 5.7 to 8.8 years, with samples
collected in the aspen type having the shortest aver-
age ﬁre-free intervals and samples collected in the
spruce-ﬁr type having the longest (WMPI values and
min/max intervals for these groups are shown in Ta-
ble 2). By aspect, MFI values for the 10%-scarred
groups ranged from 5.5 to 13.1 years, with samples
collected on south aspects having the shortest aver-
age ﬁre-free intervals and samples from north aspects
having the longest. By elevation, MFI values for the
10%-scarred groups ranged from 6.3 to 15.9 years,
with samples collected below 2,650 m having the
shortest average ﬁre-free intervals and samples col-
lected above 2,750 m having the longest.
The season of ﬁre occurrence was determined on
67% of the ﬁre scars. The majority of the scars oc-
curred in the middle earlywood to latewood but the
proportion of these scars was only 64%, compared to
85% at Galahad.
Synchrony between low- and high-elevation ﬁres
was found in the ﬁve ﬁre years in which 25% or more
of the samples were scarred (Table 3). All ﬁve
years—1735, 1748, 1773, 1785, and 1879—matched
major ﬁre years in which ﬁres burned at 3 or all 4 of
the sites previously studied on the North Rim (Fulé
et al. 2000 and in press) as well as at the Galahad site
(Table 3). Fire years were signiﬁcantly dry, as shown
by superposed epoch analysis, but pre-ﬁre years were
wet. Four of the ﬁve pre-ﬁre years were signiﬁcantly
wet at the 90% conﬁdence interval and two exceeded
the 95% conﬁdence interval (Figure 3).
Contemporary ﬁre records for the Little Park area
(buffered by 1 km) contained 71 lightning-caused
ﬁres between 1933 and 1996. None was detected in
the tree-ring ﬁre history. The largest historical ﬁre
was the 5.1-ha Upper Big Spring Canyon ﬁre (1940).
All other wildﬁres were 1.6 ha or less, most com-
monly recorded as 0.04 ha, the minimum reporting
size. All wildﬁres were suppressed until 1981. A total
of 4 lightning ignitions were allowed to burn in 1981,
1986, and 1988, but none exceeded 0.04 ha in size.
For the reliable historical period (1967–1996), 38
lightning ﬁres or 1.3 lightning ﬁres/year occurred.
Figure 3. Fire years were signiﬁcantly dry, as shown by super-
posed epoch analysis (SEA) showing the relationship between lo-
cal climate (tree-ring width index) and occurrence of ﬁres scarring
10% or more of the sample trees at the Galahad (top) and Little
Park (bottom) study sites. The average climate value is scaled to
one. Bootstrapping procedures were used to assess the statistical
signiﬁcance of climate departures above the mean (wet years) and
below the mean (dry years) in the ﬁre years (year 0), the ﬁve
years preceding ﬁres (−5 through −1), and the two years after ﬁres
(1 and 2). The three lines above and below the x-axis in each graph
represent conﬁdence intervals of 90%, 95%, and 99%.

Overstory forest structure—Little Park
Spruce-ﬁr was the predominant forest type classiﬁed
from Landsat imagery, representing 2,860 ha or 67%
of the forested area (Table 4). The remaining types,
aspen, mixed conifer, and ponderosa pine, repre-
sented 17%, 11%, and 3%, respectively. Average el-
evation increased from ponderosa pine through mixed
conifer and aspen to spruce-ﬁr, but the differences
were slight (range 68 m) (Table 4).
Species composition and tree age were the key
variables used to categorize plots as ﬁre-initiated or
non-ﬁre-initiated. Forest composition was highly var-
ied within forest types (Table 5), with all six domi-
nant tree species occurring in all four forest types.
Only RONE was limited to a single forest type
(mixed conifer). In contrast, ABLA averaged over
100 trees/ha in all four types, although the trees were
relatively small, as indicated by the low basal area
values (< 3.2 m2/ha except in the spruce-ﬁr type).
POTR trees were actually outnumbered by PIEN trees
in the aspen type, although POTR dominated in basal
area. Average tree densities ranged from a minimum
of 946 trees/ha (spruce-ﬁr type) to a maximum of
1382 trees/ha (aspen type) and basal areas ranged
from approximately 28 to 39 m2/ha. Mean canopy
cover values and standard errors were 60.9% (±
3.6%) in aspen, 55.3% (± 3.4%) in mixed conifer,
53.0% (± 10.8%) in ponderosa pine, and 51.6% (±
2.3%) in spruce-ﬁr. The highest average (60.9%) and
maximum cover on a single plot (84.6%) both oc-
curred in the aspen type. The spruce-ﬁr type had the
greatest range in cover values, 63% (minimum
18.7%, maximum 81.2%). Tree regeneration was

dense, from > 5,000 to > 12,000 seedlings or sprouts
per ha (Table 5). POTR was the most proliﬁc species,
averaging > 2,000 small trees/ha in each forest type.
At the other extreme, PIPO had no recorded regen-
eration in the aspen and spruce-ﬁr types, which make
up 78% of the landscape. No PIEN seedlings were
found in the ponderosa pine vegetation type, but it
only comprised 3% of the study area.
Age distributions (center date at the 40-cm sam-
pling height of 491 increment cores) are expressed on
a per-hectare basis by forest type in Figure 5. The
number of sample plots and number of trees aged for
each forest type are listed in Table 4. All forest types
had numerous old trees of several species but were
numerically dominated by post-1880 regeneration.
The oldest trees by species were: ABCO 1735, ABLA
1811 (ABLA was never the oldest tree on any plot),
PIEN 1788, PIPO 1618, POTR 1770, and PSME
1693.
Fire-initiated plots were identiﬁed on 58% of the
plots (35/60 plots) (Table 6). North and east aspects
had higher proportions of ﬁre-initiated plots (71% of
the N- and E-facing plots), while south and west as-
pects were nearly equal in ﬁre-initiated versus non-
ﬁre-initiated plots (51% and 49%, respectively, of the
S- and W-facing plots). The aspen and spruce-ﬁr
types had predominantly ﬁre-initiated plots (73% of
the plots in these two forest types), the ponderosa
pine type was evenly split (50% each), and the mixed
conifer type had predominantly non-ﬁre-initiated
plots (80%). The two oldest plots classiﬁed as ﬁre-
initiated were PIEN-dominated, with oldest trees dat-
ing to 1788 and 1791. The oldest POTR plot dated to
1792 and ten additional old-POTR plots predated
1860. Given the imprecision of age sampling at 40 cm
above ground level and estimating rings to pith on
many of the increment cores, we did not attempt to
ﬁnely delineate age cohorts within plots. However,
clearly distinct cohorts of POTR were evident on 9
plots. Five of these plots were classiﬁed as non-ﬁre-
initiated; the remaining four were classiﬁed as ﬁre-
initiated, with POTR as the oldest tree species. The
oldest trees on ﬁre-initiated plots were signiﬁcantly
older than on non-ﬁre-initiated plots (mean = 1754 vs.
1851, t-test P < 0.001). Fire-initiated plots also oc-
curred on steeper slopes (mean = 18.8% vs. 12.7%)
but the difference was not statistically signiﬁcant.
Mean elevations of ﬁre-initiated and non-ﬁre-initiated
plots were nearly equal (2,690 m vs. 2,682 m).
Reconstruction of forest structure in 1880 (Ta-
ble 5) showed that past forests were signiﬁcantly less
dense and had signiﬁcantly lower basal area than the
contemporary forest (paired t-test). Total tree densi-
ties ranged from 150 to 337 trees/ha, only 16–24% as
dense as the contemporary forest. Basal areas in 1880
ranged from approximately 10 to 18 m2/ha, about
36–46% as dense as the contemporary forest. Basal
area values for PIPO, POTR, and PSME were the
least changed over the 1880–2000 period, but ABCO,
ABLA, and PIEN were sparse in the 1880 forest, in
contrast to their current dominance.
Table 4. Vegetation types were classiﬁed from Landsat imagery. Plot data includes the number of plots classiﬁed as each forest type, average
slope, and the number of plots in each with north, east, south, and west aspects. No plots were located in the grass vegetation type.

Fire-scar data
A pattern of numerous small ﬁres but few larger ﬁres
emerged from the ﬁre-scar data at the Little Park site.
Seventy ﬁre years were identiﬁed between 1700 and
1879 at the Little Park study area, resulting in the
lowest mean ﬁre interval (2.6 years) of any study site
on the North Rim. This extraordinarily high ﬁre fre-
quency supports the idea that total ﬁre occurrence is
likely to increase with increasing size of the study
area, simply because more and more small ﬁres are

encountered (Minnich et al. 2000; Baker and Ehle
2001). But the majority of the ﬁres scarred a low pro-
portion of the sample trees. With a 10%-scarred ﬁlter,
the MFI rose to 8.0 years, slightly higher than the 4.0
years at Galahad and 4.5–7.1 years at the 4 other
North Rim study sites described by Fulé et al (2000
and in press). However, it was the 25%-scarred ﬁlter
that distinguished Little Park from all the lower-ele-
vation sites: 31.0 years versus 6.4–9.0 years. The
composite ﬁre frequencies calculated under the 25%-
scarred ﬁlter were similar to mean point ﬁre intervals
at Galahad and Little Park, 11.3 and 31.9 years, re-
spectively.
Little Park had a lower ﬁre frequency under the
10% and 25%-scarred ﬁlters than other high-elevation
forests in the Southwest. MFI values using the 10%-
scarred ﬁlter ranged from approximately 10–26 years
in 21 ﬁre history studies in mixed conifer forests
listed by Swetnam and Baisan (1996). With the 25%-
scarred ﬁlter, the MFI values rose only slightly, to
approximately 15–26 years (Swetnam and Baisan
1996). The ﬁre-scar ﬁre history at Little Park is also
qualitatively different from lower-elevation ﬁre histo-
ries because samples were not evenly distributed by
aspect, so surface ﬁre occurrence cannot be assumed
to have occurred uniformly over the landscape.
Where ﬁre-scarred trees were not found, it would not
be appropriate to infer that ﬁre had not occurred. In-
stead, the presence of ﬁre-initiated plots is evidence
of severe ﬁre. Even where trees were ﬁre-scarred, the
relatively long mean point ﬁre intervals compared to
Galahad suggest that individual locations on the
ground were burned much less frequently at Little
Park, similar to the pattern of increasing mean point
ﬁre intervals with elevation observed by Taylor
(2000) in California.
Forest structure data
Approximately 58% of the plots appeared to have
been ﬁre-initiated. Aspen plots would provide the
clearest evidence of past severe ﬁre if the oldest as-
pens reliably represent a post-ﬁre cohort. This inter-
pretation may be confounded by the observation of
multiple aspen cohorts on four of the old-aspen
groups classiﬁed as ﬁre-initiated. If uneven-aged as-
pen regeneration occurred, as suggested by Ripple
and Larsen (2000), old aspens would indicate a mini-
mum ﬁre-free period but not necessarily the date of a
stand-replacing ﬁre. One or more aspen cohorts were
also encountered on ﬁve plots (20%) with old ﬁre-re-
sistant trees, classiﬁed as non-ﬁre-initiated, a ﬁnding
that suggests that ﬁre severity variation even at the
sub-plot scale (< 0.1 ha) may have inﬂuenced the re-
lationship between ﬁre survivors (PIPO or PSME)
versus ﬁre-initiated POTR groups.
Spruce age data are also subject to alternative in-
terpretations depending on possible differences in
successional pathways. The oldest spruce groups, dat-
ing to circa 1790, might represent immediate post-ﬁre
regeneration following ﬁres in 1773, 1782 or 1785.
The possibility that spruce could colonize post-ﬁre
openings immediately is supported by the fact that the
old-spruce age distribution is narrow (1788, 1791,
1795, 1796). However, if the spruce succeeded an as-
pen stand, the date of an original stand-replacing ﬁre
might precede 1790 by 100 or more years.
The most reliable interpretation of the age data
from ﬁre-susceptible trees is in terms of minimum
ﬁre-free periods. By this criterion, the two old-age
PIEN groups and the oldest POTR group (1770) show
that approximately 5% of the Little Park site has not
had a ﬁre severe enough to kill ﬁre-susceptible trees
for 210–230 years. The post-1879 ﬁre-free period is
an artifact of land management practices introduced
by European settlers (Altschul and Fairley 1989; Wolf
and Mast 1998; Fulé et al. 2002), so 1880 would
serve as a better endpoint for calculating the ﬁre-free
period. In 1880, 5% of the landscape had been ﬁre-
free for at least 90–110 years, 10% of the landscape
was ﬁre-free for at least 60–80 years in 1880, 12%

was ﬁre-free for at least 40–60 years, 8% was ﬁre-
free for at least 20–40 years, and 18% was ﬁre-free
for less than 20 years. Finally, an additional 5% of
the landscape was unforested in 1880 and regenerated
with ﬁre-susceptible species between 1890–1930.
If the sampling proportions and tree ages of ﬁre-
initiated plots were translated directly into propor-
tional area, the data listed above could be used to
create a time-since-ﬁre map and calculate ﬁre rotation
(e.g., Heinselmann 1973, Agee and Krusemark 2001).
Several studies have used ﬁre scars in conjunction
with stand mapping, species composition, and tree
age measurements for developing comprehensive ﬁre
regime studies (e.g., Niklasson and Granstrom 2000,
Taylor 2000). However, the assumptions underlying
ﬁre rotation analysis are substantial: distinct bound-
aries between different aged burns (Johnson and Gut-
sell 1994:243) and clear dating of stand origins, or, in
the case of ﬁre sizes calculated from ﬁre-scar data,
assigning ﬁre areas around point locations of scarred
trees (Agee 1993). These assumptions were not well-
supported in this study, where distinct stands could
not be clearly delineated, ﬁre-initiated groups were
intermixed with non-ﬁre-initiated groups, and ﬁre-
scarred trees were not encountered evenly across the
landscape.
The weighted average of the ﬁre-free periods,
about 22 years, is reasonably close to the MFI of 31
years for the ﬁre-scar data with the 25%-scarred ﬁlter
and the mean point ﬁre interval of 31.9 years. Taken
together, the ﬁre-scar and forest structural approaches
are consistent with a mixed-severity ﬁre regime at the
Little Park site. On approximately 40% of the land-
scape, notably on S and W aspects, predominantly
surface ﬁres occurred in the 1700–1879 period repre-
sented by our samples. Even where these ﬁres burned
severely enough to initiate POTR groups at the < 0.1
ha scale, old PIPO, PSME, and ABCO trees survived.
On approximately 60% of the landscape, severe ﬁres
occurred in the Little Park site at intervals that aver-
aged 20–30 years in the century preceding 1880. Dur-
ing that period, at least 5% of the landscape had not
burned at all and at least 23% (14/60 plots) had
burned within the past 20 years.
Fire-climate relationship and ﬁre extent
Fires at Little Park and Galahad tended to occur in
drier years, as seen throughout the Southwest (Swet-
nam and Baisan 1996; Swetnam et al. 2001; Allen
2002). Swetnam and Baisan (1996) observed a pat-
tern of a wet pre-ﬁre year followed by a dry ﬁre year,
suggesting that ﬁne fuel production in wet years
might facilitate burning. We saw a trend toward wet
conditions in the pre-ﬁre year at Galahad (Figure 4),
but the observation that several years before ﬁre were
signiﬁcantly wet at Little Park was surprising. Simi-
lar trends were seen with the 25%-scarred Little Park
ﬁre chronology, but there were only ﬁve such ﬁre
dates between 1700–1879, limiting the reliability of
the ﬁre-climate relationship. It will be helpful to com-
pare further studies from high-elevation southwestern
forests to assess whether the pre-ﬁre moist conditions
are a regional or just a local phenomenon.
Fire years were synchronized between Little Park,
Galahad, and the previously studied sites. All ﬁve
major ﬁre years at Little Park (25%-scarred ﬁlter) co-
incided with major regional ﬁre years (Table 3). The
dry PDSI values reconstructed in regional ﬁre years
(Table 3) support Swetnam and Baisan (1996) con-
tention that climate must have been the major factor
underlying regionally synchronous burning. The re-
constructed PDSI values do not have the accuracy of
measured weather data (see Cook et al. (1996) for
validation data), but comparisons may be useful in
relative terms. The average PDSI value for all the ﬁre
years listed in Table 4 was −1.89, compared to an av-
erage of −0.37 for the entire 1700–1879 period. Av-
erage PDSI in the ﬁve major regional ﬁres at both low
and high elevation (shaded rows in Table 4) was
−3.28, corresponding to severe drought conditions
(Cook et al. 1996).
Considering only the actual sampled areas, ﬁres in
major regional ﬁre years such as 1785 (Figure 1) ap-
pear to have covered at least 5,000 ha, either as one
large ﬁre or several separate ignitions. The Galahad
site (410 ha) was actually less linked to Little Park
(4,400 ha), located upslope and downwind, than were
the four western sites in 1773, a major regional ﬁre
year in which ﬁre was not detected at Galahad (Ta-
ble 3). Continuous fuels existed between all the sites
and Little Park shared major ﬁre years with the sites
located directly west, so ﬁre in years such as 1785
could have burned at least 24,000 ha, the between-
site area. But fuels extend to the north and east well
beyond the extent of all the sampled areas, suggest-
ing that ﬁres may have been much larger.
Changes in forest structure
Dendroecological reconstruction showed that forest
tree structure had changed substantially since 1880.
481

The accuracy of the forest reconstruction procedure
used here was discussed by Fulé et al. (1997, 2002).
In general, reconstructions are reliable if the site has
not been disturbed, if the period of reconstruction is
not excessive relative to the lifespan of the trees, and
if dead tree evidence (stemwood, bark, and/or root-
ball) is likely to persist (e.g., Habeck 1990, Foster et
al. 1996). In the present case, the Little Park study
site has never been harvested and was not burned over
the reconstruction period. Individuals from all six
dominant tree species had lifespans 200–300% of the
reconstruction period (Figure 5). The persistence of
dead tree evidence is well-established for ponderosa
pine in northern Arizona (Mast et al. 1999; Huffman
et al. 2001). The persistence of other species is less
documented, especially for small trees. However, the
striking changes in forest structure would still be evi-
dent even if dense small tree groups had been present
in 1880 and subsequently disappeared. As an example
of the upper boundary of error, assume that all the
trees < 15 cm dbh present today were to be added to
the 1880 forest. The tree density would rise by an av-
erage 526 trees/ha but the basal area would increase
by only 1.3 m2/ha, accounting for only about 6.5% of
the rise in basal area from 1880 to 2000.
The oldest forest survey of the Kaibab Plateau, by
Lang and Stewart (1910), was in remarkably close
agreement with the forest reconstruction results (Ta-
ble 7). Lang and Stewart (1910) spruce-balsam
stand average tree densities were within 5–9% of re-
constructed tree density values. The spruce-balsam
(spruce-ﬁr) was described as occupying only north-
ern aspects up to 8,800 feet [2,683 m] elevation where
it extends over the ridges. Occasionally large veteran
yellow pine [old-growth ponderosa pine] occur
among the balsam and spruce, a strong evidence that
the primeval forest was pine. It is thought that the
mixed type has succeeded the original yellow pine on
account of the cumulative effects of severe ﬁres, and
is still advancing upon it (Lang and Stewart 1910:9).
With respect to ﬁres, they commented on vast de-
nuded areas, charred stubs and fallen trunks ... The
old ﬁres extended over large areas at higher altitudes,
amounting to several square miles on either side of
Big Park [now called DeMotte Park, immediately N
of the present Little Park study site] and to numerous
smaller irregular areas over the remainder of the for-
est (Lang and Stewart 1910:18–19). Aspen was de-
scribed as exceedingly active in restocking burns
and they photographed Spruce-Balsam coming in
under aspen on northern exposure of old burns (Lang
and Stewart 1910:9, 18–19). In contrast, at lower el-
evation, evidence indicates light ground ﬁres over
practically the whole forest... (Lang and Stewart
1910:19).
The oldest PIEN tree on the Little Park site had a
center date of 1788 at the 40-cm coring height. Much
older spruce stands were reported by Grissino-Mayer
et al. (1995) in southern Arizona (300+ years) and
Aplet et al. (1988) in Colorado, where four out of ﬁve
study sites had trees in the 251–275 year category and
the oldest trees were in the 601–625 year category.
The oldest ABLA at Little Park had a center date of
only 1811, well below the 200–500 year age range of
ABLA in Colorado (Aplet et al. 1988). The oldest
POTR tree was about 230 years (1770 center date) but
the majority of POTR were also young. A notable re-
duction in POTR regeneration occurred around the
1920–1940 age class (Figure 5). POTR cohorts from
this period may have been killed by heavy deer
browsing during the 1920s and 30s (Rasmussen 1941;
Merkle 1954, 1962; Mitchell and Freeman 1993; Fulé
et al. 2002). Apart from this period of reduced regen-
eration, POTR regeneration was consistent in all for-
est types since the early 1800s and heavy POTR re-
generation also occurred through the mid-1900s

(Figure 5), with several plots supporting multiple age
cohorts of POTR. These ﬁndings tend to support the
hypothesis of Ripple and Larsen (2000) that aspen is
capable of uneven-aged regeneration in the absence
of heavy herbivore pressure, notably elk. Unlike most
regions with aspen in the West, the Kaibab Plateau
has been free of elk until recently and the current
population is small (S. Germaine, Arizona Game and
Fish Department, personal communication 2001).
The intersecting evidence of intermittent broad-
scale ﬁres recorded on ﬁre scars, relatively young age
structure of all ﬁre-susceptible species, low forest
density, and historical accounts reinforce a picture of
a very open forest of many young trees in 1880, with
more than half of the Little Park site in early post-ﬁre
successional stages. At a scale of centuries, the
mixed-severity ﬁres may have exhibited an unstable
or non-equilibrium pattern dominated by drought in-
ﬂuences. Meko et al. (1995) identiﬁed the periods
1879–1883 and 1773–1782 as the driest 5- and 10-
year periods in Arizona since 1600. Salzer (2000)
bristlecone pine chronology from northern Arizona
did not identify exactly the same periods as Meko et
al. (1995), but recorded several warm/dry episodes in
the 1700s and none in the 1800s. At Little Park, rela-
tively frequent large ﬁres in the 1700s (4 ﬁre dates:
1735, 1748, 1773, and 1785) contrast with a single
large ﬁre in the 1800s (1879, although ﬁres in 1806,
1847, and 1873 were also widespread, scarring
 23% of the samples, nearly meeting the 25%-scar-
ring criterion). One interpretation of the ﬁre and cli-
mate data is that wetter conditions in the 1800s made
possible the 94-year period without a major ﬁre from
1785 to 1879. Fuel accumulation in this period could
have supported more severe ﬁre effects at the land-
scape scale during the 1879 ﬁre event than the shorter
ﬁre-free periods prior to 1785, leading to the open
post-ﬁre forest conditions reconstructed in 1880 and
observed by Lang and Stewart (1910). However, if
1806, 1847, and 1873 are also considered as major
ﬁre years, the apparent difference between the burn-
ing patterns in the 1700s and 1800s disappears. Un-
der this alternative interpretation, the open forest con-
ditions and young stand age may have been typical
of both centuries. Given the relatively short temporal
period of these data, it is not possible to say which
pattern was characteristic of the long-term ﬁre regime
at high elevations.
Currently a very dense spruce-ﬁr forest predomi-
nates at Little Park. All forest types—even those that
predominantly contain non-ﬁre-initiated groups—ex-
hibit high densities (782–1,382 trees/ha), basal areas
(28–39 m2/ha), canopy cover (52–61%), and woody
debris (99–142 Mg/ha). These characteristics can sup-
port high-intensity, severe, stand-replacing ﬁres. The
Outlet ﬁre, ignited in a prescribed burning operation
on May 9, 2000, burned over 5,260 ha of Grand Can-
yon National and Kaibab National Forest lands SE of
Little Park (Bertolette and Spotskey 2001). Within the
park, approximately 30% of the ﬁre area burned with
low severity (tree scorching but no overstory mortal-
ity), 34% with moderate severity, 35% with high se-
verity (complete overstory mortality), and less than
2% unburned (Bertolette and Spotskey 2001, and D.
Bertolette, personal communication, 2002). The post-
ﬁre distribution of burn severities appears similar to
the
distribution
of
ﬁre-initiated/non-ﬁre-initiated
groups at Little Park in 1879, suggesting that ﬁres
similar to the Outlet ﬁre are not unprecedented in the
high-elevation forest. However, the high severity
burning in the Outlet ﬁre was concentrated in the
center of the wind-driven burn area (Bertolette and
Spotskey 2001), in contrast to the highly mixed spa-
tial pattern of ﬁre-initiated/non-ﬁre-initiated groups at
Little Park.
Park managers should recognize the near certainty
that ﬁre behavior similar to that observed on the Out-
let ﬁre will also occur at Little Park and other high-
elevation forests under windy drought conditions. Se-
vere burning is historically precedented in many of
these forests, as shown in this study, but the vegeta-
tion types dominated by PIPO, PSME, and ABCO
appear to have become unusually dense with young
ﬁr and spruce trees. Instead of mixed-severity ﬁre ef-
fects in a patchwork of stand densities, the modern
forest forms a homogenous fuel complex (White and
Vankat 1993) that appears likely to burn with high
severity over a greater fraction of the landscape than
in 1785, 1879, or other past ﬁre years. Managers may
wish to consider prescribed burning and fuel reduc-
tion treatments on S and W aspects, as well as exten-
sive use of wildland ﬁres managed for resource ben-
eﬁts, if they choose to try to restore fuel conditions
similar to historic conditions. We were able to recon-
struct past forest structure with high accuracy, as sup-
ported by Lang and Stewart (1910) measurements,
and to some extent these reconstructions can serve as
a guide to developing appropriate restoration targets.
However, our understanding of historical conditions
in a broader sense is likely to always remain impre-
cise for two reasons. First, while the combination of
ﬁre scar analysis, remote sensing, tree age, and forest
483

structure measurements applied here served to pro-
vide a relatively detailed and multifaceted assessment
of past ﬁre regimes, there are inherent limitations to
all these methods that circumscribe inferences about
the severity and exact geographical extent of past ﬁre
events. The transition zone studied here, changing
from surface to stand-replacing ﬁres, may be the most
complex case for ﬁre regime reconstruction. Second,
even if we were fully able to reconstruct the details
of every ﬁre from 1700 to 1879, the pattern of severe
burning did not appear to be stable over the spatial
and temporal scale of the study. These considerations
imply that managers may be best advised to view the
historical condition in high-elevation southwestern
forests as a relatively general guide to reference con-
ditions, in contrast to the more speciﬁc and tempo-
rally stable reference data available for lower-eleva-
tion ponderosa pine forests.
