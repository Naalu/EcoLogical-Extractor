Fire Effects on Gambel Oak in Southwestern 
Ponderosa Pine-Oak Forests
Scott R. Abella and Peter Z. Fulé
Abstract—Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) is ecologically and aesthetically valuable in southwestern ponderosa 
pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests. Fire effects on Gambel oak are important because fire may be used in pine-oak forests 
to manage oak directly or to accomplish other management objectives. We used published literature to: (1) ascertain 
historical fire regimes in pine-oak forests, (2) discern prescribed burning effects on Gambel oak survival and diameter 
growth, and (3) provide suggestions for using fire to manage oak. Frequent fire is part of Gambel oak’s historical 
environment, as historical fire return intervals often averaged less than 10 years in pine-oak forests. More than 66 percent 
of oaks greater than 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter were alive at least 5 years after two contemporary prescribed fires, 
whereas survival was low (<20 percent) for small oaks less than 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter. Top-killed oaks resprout 
prolifically, suggesting that fire can maintain shrub-sprout forms of oak constituting browse and cover for some wildlife 
species. Unlike mechanically thinning competing trees, burning has not been found to increase oak diameter growth. We 
conclude that fire can be used to manage Gambel oak densities and growth forms, and that large oaks can be maintained 
during low-intensity burning. Several tactics may enhance survival of large oaks during prescribed fire: keeping pine 
slash away from oak boles, avoiding lighting near oaks or reducing fire intensity near oaks, and raking fuels away from 
oak boles.

Introduction
Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) occurs as an 
understory or mid-story tree in otherwise pure south-
western ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests. 
This deciduous oak has high ecological and aesthetic 
value (Harper and others 1985). Large oaks are par-
ticularly valuable to some wildlife species and can live 
for more than 400 years (Swetnam and Brown 1992). 
Fire effects on Gambel oak are important to under-
stand because fire may be used in ponderosa pine-oak 
forests to accomplish various management objec-
tives (for example, fuels reduction), or to manage oak 
specifically. In this note, we summarize published lit-
erature to: (1) evaluate the frequency and timing of 
fire in historical pine-oak forests; (2) assess effects of 
contemporary prescribed burning on oak survival and 
diameter growth; and (3) provide recommendations 
for managing oak directly using fire while maintain-
ing large oaks.
Fire and Oak’s Historical Environment
Most fire-history studies have discovered that 
surface fires burned ponderosa pine-Gambel oak for-
ests on average at least once every <13 years before 
policies of fire exclusion beginning in the late 1800s 
(table  1). One exception was an isolated 371-acre 
(150-ha) mesa in southern Utah that Madany and West 
(1983) found burned less frequently than is typical of 
pine-oak forests. At a northern Arizona pine-oak site 
exhibiting a mean fire interval of 3.7 years, Fulé and 
others (1997) found that 40 percent of historical fires 
occurred in spring (late April to June) and 60 percent 
in summer (July to early September). Fire-history re-
search indicates that frequent, spring-summer fires 
have long been part of Gambel oak’s historical envi-
ronment in many southwestern pine-oak forests.
Despite the historical prevalence of fire on sites con-
taining Gambel oak, Brown and Smith (2000) indicate 
that Gambel oak has low fire resistance at maturity and 
there is no size at which the species attains fire resis-
tance. Simonin (2000) reported that Gambel oak bark 
ranges from 0.5 to 0.75 inches (1.2 to 1.9 cm) thick, 
categorized by Brown and Smith (2000) as “thin.” 
However, no information was provided as to whether 
thickness increases with age, as it does in some oak

species (Peterson and Reich 2001). Nevertheless, bole 
charring (occasionally visible on large, living Gambel 
oak) likely obtained before fire exclusion in the late 
1800s suggests that large oaks had at least some ca-
pacity to survive low-intensity fire (fig. 1). It is also 
possible that rocky microsites or other areas Gambel 
oak sometimes occupies burned less frequently than 
surrounding areas. However, this explanation does 
not account for oak’s persistence on relatively flat, 
uniform sites that also burned frequently (Hanks 
and others 1983). Differences in fuel characteristics 
between Gambel oak and ponderosa pine litter are ad-
ditional factors that may have allowed oak to persist 
on frequently burned sites. Compared to pine, looser, 
less resinous, and moister oak litter may have resulted 
in decreased fire intensity near oak boles, allowing 
large oaks to persevere. Such fine-scale variations in 
fire intensities have been recorded during contempo-
rary burns in other oak forests (Franklin and others 
1997).
In addition to some ability of large Gambel oaks to 
survive low-intensity fire, oaks top-killed by fire usu-
ally resprout (Harrington 1985, Kunzler and Harper 
1980). Gambel oak is thus both a resister and an en-
durer of fire, following Rowe’s (1983) classification 
of plant adaptations to fire. Large oaks develop some 
ability to survive (resist) fire, while stems top-killed 
by fire resprout (endure).
Table 1—Summary of surface fire frequencies before fire exclusion in ponderosa pine-Gambel oak forests. With some exceptions, 
pine-oak forests generally burned at least once every 10 years, similar to pure ponderosa pine forests.

Prescribed Burning Effects on 
Different Size Classes
To track Gambel oak survival 5 years after fall or 
early spring burning, we used data collected from two 
northern Arizona sites that are part of ecological res-
toration projects detailed in Fulé and others (2005) 
and Roccaforte (2005). Survival of oaks greater than 
6 inches (15 cm) in diameter at 4.5 ft (1.4 m) exceeded 
66 percent at both sites, while survival was low (11 to 
20 percent) for small stems less than 2 inches (5 cm) in 
diameter (fig. 2). These findings reflect survival after 
these particular fires, and may differ from other burns 
conducted under different weather or fuel characteris-
tics. Survival may also vary depending on operational 
aspects of burns, such as whether fuel is raked away 
from oak boles or if oak clumps are deliberately lit 
(Ken Moore, Bureau of Land Management, pers. 
comm. 2005). Nonetheless, these data support the 
conclusions of Fulé and others (2005) that large oaks 
can be maintained during burns, and are consistent 
with oak’s persistence in recurrently burned pine-oak 
forests (table 1).
Fire Season, Frequency, and  
Intensity Effects
Season of burning affects both fire intensity and 
oak carbohydrate reserves that influence sprouting 
ability. Harrington (1985, 1989) tested the effects 
of burn season (spring [June], summer [August], or 
fall [October]) and frequency (one or two burns in a 
4-year period) on Gambel oak in a Colorado pine-oak 
stand. He found that after 4 years, all burn treatments 
sharply increased sprout densities relative to unburned 
controls because of prolific sprouting of top-killed, 
small-diameter stems. A second burn in summer, 
however, resulted in the least sprouting because oak 
carbohydrate reserves that incite sprouting were low-
est at this time. Nevertheless, it seems that burning in

Arizona study sites in ponderosa 
pine-oak forests. Survival exceeded 
66 percent for stems greater than 6

any season top kills small stems and stimulates shrub-
like sprouting (Harrington 1985). Continued frequent 
burning and top-killing would likely maintain shrubby 
growth forms of oak, although effects of specific burn 
intervals on sprouting dynamics and persistence of 
oak are not well known.
Several studies have reported large increases in 
Gambel oak dominance after intense wildfires have 
reduced densities of competing vegetation (Kunzler 
and Harper 1980, Savage and Mast 2005). This is 
not surprising given oak’s strong sprouting ability, in 
contrast to many other competing species in pine-oak 
forests (for example, ponderosa pine). Savage and 
Mast (2005) proposed a successional model for pine-
oak forests after severe fires that included a succession 
to oak shrubfields after removal of the ponderosa pine 
overstory. Any such intense disturbance likely pro-
motes oak, illustrated by a similar succession to oak 
shrubfields after clearcutting ponderosa pine on the 
Beaver Creek watershed in Arizona (Ffolliott and 
Gottfried 1991).
Burning Effects on Diameter Growth
Large oaks have high ecological and aesthetic 
value, and increasing oak diameter growth may be 
a management objective on some sites. Onkonburi 
(1999) reported that prescribed burning had variable 
effects on oak diameter growth at 7 northern Arizona 
sites, but reasons for the among site differences could 
not be pinpointed. In her study, burning resulted in 
an average decrease of 0.1 inches (0.2 cm) to an in-
crease of 0.3  inches (0.8 cm) in diameter growth 
among sites over a 10-year period. Fulé and others 
(2005) also found that burning did not significantly 
increase oak diameter growth 5 years after burning. 
However, fire effects on oak diameter growth could 
depend on the degree of charring damage or whether 
competing trees are killed or damaged. These factors 
likely hinge upon fire characteristics and prescriptions. 
Nevertheless, current data suggest that management 
tools other than fire, such as thinning competing pine 
or other trees, more reliably increase oak diameter 
growth (Onkonburi 1999).
Fire and the Management of  
Pine-Oak Forests
Fire may be used in pine-oak forests to manage 
Gambel oak directly or to accomplish other objectives 
such as fuel reduction. Because of their ecological 
and aesthetic value, we believe that any management 
strategy should strive to maintain existing large, old 
oaks. We offer the following suggestions to maintain 
large oaks during prescribed burning: (1) reduce fire 
intensity and duration near oak boles or avoid delib-
erately lighting near oaks; (2) keep pine slash away 
from oaks to be retained; and (3) rake fuel (particular-
ly pine litter) away from bases of oak boles. Because 
fuel loads in contemporary forests are much greater 
than in pre-fire exclusion pine-oak forests, raking fuel 
is a conservative measure that may increase oak sur-
vival. If raking around old ponderosa pine already is 
planned, there seems little reason not to rake around 
old oaks as well. Several studies suggest that burning 
can be implemented without killing large oaks (fig. 2; 
Fulé and others 2005, Roccaforte 2005). In addition, 
particular consideration could be given to maintaining 
medium-sized oaks of 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 cm) 
in diameter, which McCulloch and others (1965) 
found to produce the most acorns. It is not currently 
well-known how fire may affect acorn production, as 
production also depends on crown vigor (McCulloch 
and others 1965). Crown vigor could be positively or 
negatively affected by fire.
Fire can be used to manage Gambel oak directly 
to top kill small-diameter (<6-inch, 15-cm) stems 
(fig. 2). Densities of these small-diameter oaks may 
have increased in pine-oak forests since initiation of 
fire exclusion in the late 1800s (Fulé and others 1997). 
By stimulating sprouting, fire can also maintain shrub-
thicket forms of oak, which are important habitat for 
some wildlife species (Kruse 1992, Rosenstock 1998). 
However, a key research need is to increase our un-
derstanding of oak stand structures and recruitment 
patterns that may arise after long-term burning at vari-
ous frequencies.
Summary and  
Management Implications
Fire is part of Gambel oak’s historical environment. 
• 
Oak persisted in historical ponderosa pine-oak 
forests that typically burned at least once every  
10 years.
Large Gambel oak exhibit some capacity to survive 
• 
low-intensity fire, and stems top- killed by fire 
usually resprout prolifically.
Fire of any kind is unlikely to eliminate Gambel 
• 
oak from a site. Intense wildfires that remove 
competing vegetation often facilitate development 
of oak brushfields on sites formerly dominated by 
ponderosa pine.

Large oaks have high ecological and aesthetic 
• 
value. To help ensure survival of large oaks during 
prescribed burning, we suggest that managers: 
avoid deliberately lighting near the bases of oak 
boles, keep pine slash away from oaks, and rake 
fuel away from oaks to reduce fire intensity.
Prescribed burning can temporarily decrease 
• 
densities of small-diameter oaks, which may 
have increased in density since initiation of fire 
exclusion in pine-oak forests in the late 1800s. 
However, due to prolific sprouting, single burns 
could also result in subsequent increases in oak 
density. Manipulating burn frequency has potential 
for maintaining a variety of oak growth forms, 
including shrub-thicket forms of oak important for 
some species of wildlife.
Other management techniques, such as thinning 
• 
pine or other competing trees, appear better 
suited than prescribed burning for increasing oak 
diameter growth.
