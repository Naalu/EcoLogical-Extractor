Abstract
 
FIRESUM, an ecological process model incorporating
surface fire disturbance, was modified for use in south-
western ponderosa pine ecosystems. The model was
used to determine changes in forest structure over time
and then applied to simulate changes in aboveground
biomass and nitrogen storage since exclusion of the
natural frequent fire regime in an unharvested Arizona
forest. Dendroecological reconstruction of forest struc-
ture in 1876, prior to Euro-American settlement, was
used to initialize the model; projections were vali-
dated with forest measurements in 1992. Biomass allo-
cations shifted from herbaceous plants to trees, and
nitrogen was increasingly retained in living and dead
tree biomass over the 116-year period (1876–1992). For-
est conditions in 1992 were substantially degraded com-
pared to reference presettlement conditions: old-growth
trees were dying at accelerated rates, herbaceous pro-
duction was reduced nearly 90%, and the entire stand
was highly susceptible to high-intensity wildfire. Fol-
lowing an experiment initiated in 1993 to test ecologi-
 
cal restoration treatments, future changes were mod-
eled for the next century. Future forest structure remained
within the natural presettlement range of variability un-
der the full restoration treatment, in which forest biomass
structure was thinned to emulate presettlement condi-
tions and repeated low-intensity fire was reintroduced.
Simulation of the control treatment indicated continu-
ation of exceptionally high tree density, probably cul-
minating in stand-replacing ecosystem change through
high-intensity wildfire or tree mortality from patho-
gens. Intermediate results were observed in the partial
restoration treatment (tree thinning only); the open for-
est structure and high herbaceous productivity found
immediately after treatment were gradually degraded
as dense tree cover reestablished in the absence of fire.
Modeling results support comprehensive restorative
management as a long-term approach to conservation
of key indigenous ecosystem characteristics.

Introduction
 
R
 
estoring ponderosa pine forest ecosystems affected
by a century or more of fire exclusion, old-tree har-
vesting, and livestock grazing is a major challenge. Across
the western United States, ponderosa forests have be-
come dense with small, young trees, herbaceous pro-
ductivity has declined, and forest floor fuels have accu-
mulated. Today forest landscapes support high-intensity
wildfires and are increasingly susceptible to large-scale
pathogen outbreaks (Covington & Moore 1994
 
a
 
). Resto-
ration experiments have begun following several ap-
proaches based on thinning, burning, fuel treatments,
seeding, and other treatments (Fiedler et al. 1988; Sack-
ett et al. 1996; Covington et al. 1997; Scott 1998). Fore-
casting long-term effects of alternative treatments through
ecological simulation modeling provides useful infor-
mation to scientists, managers, and the public in mak-
ing decisions about the nature and priorities of restora-
tion efforts.
Two distinct modeling methods are available: statisti-
cal models based on analysis of past system behavior,
and process models, often with stochastic elements,
which seek to emulate underlying biological or physical
processes. Because the fitting of statistical models to
readily measurable data can be done with great preci-
sion, such models tend to be highly accurate in the near
term, as long as the original environmental conditions
under which the model was developed are maintained.
Several statistical growth and yield models are avail-
able for ponderosa pine (e.g., Wycoff et al. 1982; Edmin-
ster et al. 1991).
However, because actual biological relationships are
modeled, process models are more suitable for analysis of
system behavior under changing environmental condi-
tions, over long time periods (when mortality and regen-
eration processes are modeled), and under disturbance
regimes, such as fire, which were not incorporated in the
datasets used to develop statistical models. Short-term

predictive accuracy may be reduced for process models
as compared to statistical models, because data for model
development may be more difficult to obtain and the va-
riety of complex natural processes may be more difficult
to model.
Successional change in western forests under alterna-
tive fire regimes has been simulated with the ecological
process models SILVA (Kercher & Axelrod 1984) in Cal-
ifornia and FIRESUM (Keane et al. 1989; 1990) in the
northern Rocky Mountains. The models simulate changes
in forest species composition and fuel loading at the plot
level under alternative fire regimes. They trace their de-
velopment history to JABOWA (Botkin et al. 1972), a pro-
cess-based, gap-replacement ecological model, which has
been used to analyze ecosystem dynamics in northern
hardwoods (e.g., Covington 1981). FIRESUM models over-
story and understory ecological change under either user-
determined or stochastic fire regimes, incorporating
Rothermel’s (1972) surface fire behavior model to predict
fire behavior. The program can simulate fire effects on
mortality, regeneration, and tree density, changes in spe-
cies composition, forest density, and fuels over several
centuries, with implications for fire danger, wildlife
habitat, old-growth conservation, and other manage-
ment issues. Keane et al. (1989; 1990) provide validation
data and sensitivity testing for FIRESUM in ponderosa
pine and mixed conifer forests. More recently, the gap-
replacement and fire modeling components of FIRESUM
have been integrated with the detailed mechanistic model
FOREST-BGC (Running & Coughlan 1988; Running &
Gower 1991) in a new model, FIRE-BGC, to permit suc-
cessional modeling which incorporates biogeochemical
process modeling at highly resolved time steps and large
spatial scales (Keane et al. 1996). Because of its complexity
and high input requirements, however, FIRE-BGC will
require extensive testing and sampling before it can be ex-
tended to sites beyond the northern Rockies.
Beginning in 1992, we initiated an ecological restora-
tion experiment in a fire-excluded ponderosa pine for-
est at the Gus Pearson Natural Area (hereafter GPNA).
Three treatments were tested: (1) control; (2) full resto-
ration of ecosystem structure (thinning to restore den-
sity, age, size, and spatial distributions of trees) and fire
disturbance process (removal of accumulated duff, re-
introduction of fire in prescription at four-year inter-
vals); and (3) partial restoration (thinning only, without
fire). The treatments and initial results are described by
Covington et al. (1997). We selected FIRESUM to pre-
dict long-term treatment effects. Our study objectives
were to: (1) modify and validate the FIRESUM ecologi-
cal process model for a southwestern ponderosa pine
forest, expanding the model capabilities with biomass
and nutrient models; and (2) predict ecological changes
at the actual restoration site, comparing and contrasting
the long-term effects of alternative treatments.
 
Methods
 
The study area is a 4.7-ha experimental restoration site
at the Gus Pearson Natural Area, in the Fort Valley Ex-
perimental Forest, approximately 15 km NW of Flag-
staff, Arizona. Within the GPNA trees larger than 15.2
cm at breast height have been measured at 5- or 10-year
intervals since 1920 (Avery et al. 1976 and unpublished
data). The study area has gentle topography and a cool,
subhumid climate. Mean annual precipitation is 57 cm,
with approximately half occurring as snow. The remain-
der occurs as summer monsoonal rains following the
spring/early summer drought. Soils are of volcanic ori-
gin, a fine smectitic complex of frigid Typic Argiborolls
and Eutroboralfs (Covington et al. 1997). The ponderosa
pine structure consists of groups of mature trees, charac-
terized by larger size and yellowed bark, above dense
thickets of smaller, dark-barked trees. Understory vege-
tation includes perennial grasses, primarily 
 
Festuca ari-
zonica
 
 (Arizona fescue), 
 
Muhlenbergia montana
 
 (mountain
muhly), and 
 
Sitanion hystrix
 
 (squirreltail), and forbs.
Treatments were applied in 1993–94 as shown in Fig-
ure 1. The entire study site was divided into 17 units,
each approximately 0.2–0.3 ha in size and each contain-
ing examples of presettlement tree groups, postsettle-
ment tree groups, and remnant grassy opening. Units
on the eastern and southwestern corners were excluded
from the experiment due to the proximity of a highway
on the east and previous thinning in the Southwest. The

Natural Area, Arizona. Numbered squares are the 20 ! 20–meter 
plots used for modeling. Dark lines are unit boundaries (five rep-
licated units of each treatment). Small areas at the eastern and 
southwestern corners were excluded from the experiment but

treatment area was officially “decommissioned” from
the GPNA so that thinning and burning could be car-
ried out (one goal of the treatment was to reduce fire
hazard next to the historic research headquarters). The
full and partial restoration treatments were randomly
assigned to 5 units each in the southern and eastern
parts of the study site. The control treatment was con-
strained to 5 units in the northwestern portion of the
site, an area that remained within the Research Natural
Area. Both the control and treatment areas crossed the
minor elevational and geomorphological gradients in
the study site, although the southeastern end of the
study site was relatively lower and flatter. Pretreatment
soil characteristics (N, P, organic matter) and mature
tree characteristics (predawn water potential, basal area
growth, diameter, and competition index) were not sig-
nificantly different between treatments (Stone 1997),
strengthening inferences from the experiment.
The FIRESUM model for ponderosa pine/Douglas fir
habitats, as documented by Keane et al. (1989), was en-
hanced or changed for southwestern ponderosa pine
forests as follows. Tree biomass and nutrient modules
using allometric ponderosa pine equations developed
from northern Arizona data were added (W. W. Cov-
ington, unpublished data). An herbage module based
on overstory–understory relationships in northern Ari-
zona ponderosa pine was incorporated (Solomon 1985;
see also Covington & Fox 1991). Several input parame-
ters representing maximal variable levels were changed
based on southwestern data, including: maximum age

data from White 1985 and Mast et al. 1999) for frequent-
fire modeling. Mortality risk for ponderosa pine from
fire was calculated using data for “light surface fires”
and “hot surface fires” from Lindenmuth (1960).
Multiple runs of FIRESUM were made in two differ-
ent ways. First, each run of the model consisted of 2 sto-
chastic simulations. Second, 10 repetitions were made
of each modeling scenario to expand the potential for
stochastic variability, for a total of 20 simulations (2 
 
!
 
10) per plot per scenario.
Two model validation approaches were taken. First,
following the validation procedure used by Keane et al.
(1989; 1990), data were developed at two points in time
for the study area. Trees were measured and mapped in
the study area in 1992. Forest structure was recon-
structed using dendroecological methods for 1876, the
final year of the frequent-fire regime that prevailed prior
to Euro-American settlement (Dieterich 1980; Covington
et al. 1997; Mast et al. 1999). FIRESUM was initialized
with 1876 data and run for 116 years (1876–1992) with-
out fire to estimate the 1992 forest structure. A total of 90
plots, each 400 m
 
2
 
, were prepared from the Pearson dataset
(Fig. 1). Because model runs based on the Pearson data
were also needed to assess the effects of changes to model
parameters, the dataset was split. Forty-five plots falling
within the treatment units (15 per treatment) were used to
test changes in model parameters (model data). The re-
maining 45 plots were set aside as a validation dataset.
Model and validation data plots were interspersed.
The second validation approach tested the internal con-
sistency and stability of the model. If the presettlement
frequent-fire regime had continued after 1876 up to the
present, forest structure would be expected to remain rela-
tively similar to the 1876 conditions, in contrast to the sub-
stantial increases in tree density and basal area observed
under fire exclusion. FIRESUM was initialized with the re-
constructed 1876 data (all 90 plots) run for 500 years at a
4-year fire interval. Simulated fire conditions listed in Ta-
ble 1 corresponded to relatively dry spring and summer
burning, the natural fire season in the Southwest (Swet-
nam & Baisan 1996). Climatic and soils data were summa-
rized from GPNA weather records and Avery et al. (1976).
Finally, using the validated model, we simulated the
effects of the three treatments over the next century. The
model dataset consisting of 45 plots, 15 plots in each
treatment, was initialized in the treatment year (1994)
and run till the year 2100 (106 years). Thinning was sim-
ulated by setting the input tree list equal to the actual
post-thinning forest structure on each plot. For the burn-
ing treatment, fires were simulated at 4- and 10-year in-
tervals. Mean density and basal area values in 1994 and
2100 were compared with paired 
 
t
 
-tests (alpha

sonably consistent with the contemporary measure-
ments. Basal area predictions were within 
 
#
 
6.5% of ob-
served values for both datasets, but density predictions
were 6 to 18% lower than the observed values. The re-
duced density predictions may be related to the fact
that modeled regeneration occurred early during the
1876–1992 simulation period, whereas the actual regen-
eration pulse at the Pearson Area was delayed until the
early twentieth century, especially 1919 (Savage et al.
1996). Because regeneration was simulated earlier, the
1992 modeled density had a longer period of self-thin-
ning. Ponderosa pine self-thinning is slow in the ab-
sence of fire (Cooper 1960), but it does occur. Dead post-
settlement trees, mostly 1914–1919 origin (Savage et al.
1996; Mast et al. 1999), made up 16.2% of all postsettle-
ment trees in the study area in 1992, providing a mini-
mal estimate of self-thinning rates over approximately
80 years (not accounting for mortality of very small trees
which may have decomposed completely by 1992). Dif-
ferences in aboveground biomass predictions versus
observations ranged from 9 (trees) to 45% (herbaceous).
Forest floor loadings were more variable, with differ-
ences ranging from 6 (100-hr timelag woody fuels) to
87% (litter loading). The higher difference in litter load-
ing may reflect inaccuracies in the modeling of litter
production or decomposition rates or may be related to
imprecision in litter bulk density data (Harrington 1986).
The highest errors in proportional terms occurred for
variables with low absolute values, such as herbaceous
production. However, the total model error over the
166-year simulation was only 
 
!
 
30 kg/ha for herbaceous
production in absolute terms, a highly accurate esti-
mate for this type of data.
Modeling for 5 centuries under a continuing fre-
quent-fire regime showed fluctuations in tree density
and basal area, but the behavior was relatively stable
(Fig. 2). Pulses of tree regeneration were observed at ap-
proximately century intervals, affecting tree density
(trees/ha) approximately 20 to 30%. Since the seedlings
were small, basal area was not affected. This limited
variation appears consistent with current understand-
ing of presettlement forest dynamics and shows that the
modeled processes are internally consistent.
 
Changes Since Fire Exclusion
 
Actual forest density increases during the fire-exclusion
period from an average of 60.5 trees/ha and 10.6 m

basal area in 1992, (Covington et al. 1997) were closely
simulated by the model. Simulated herbaceous produc-
tion declined as forest density increased (Fig. 3). The ac-
tual decline was probably more precipitous, as heavy
livestock grazing rapidly removed understory vegeta-
tion (Dieterich 1980; also see 1909 GPNA photograph in
Covington & Moore 1994
 
a
 
) while the model curve re-
sponded to the slower increase in overstory density.
Simulated tree biomass increased by 73%, from approxi-
mately 81,500 kg/ha to 140,700 kg/ha, about 8% higher
than the biomass calculated from tree measurements in
1992. Although herbaceous biomass was always a small
fraction of tree biomass, the relative change was greater:
a decline of 87% from approximately 780 kg/ha in 1876
to 99 kg/ha in 1992. The measured herbaceous produc-
tion in 1992 averaged even less, 70 kg/ha (Table 2).
Shifts in nitrogen storage paralleled those in biomass.
Nitrogen stored in trees increased by 115%, from 1,150
kg/ha to 2,460 kg/ha. The increase in tree N was dis-
proportionately greater than the growth in tree biomass
because the new, small trees contributed relatively
more N-rich foliage than N-poor wood and bark. Her-
baceous N, calculated from average N content for grass
and forb species at GPNA (1.17%, average from Harris

dropped from 7.4 kg/ha to 0.9 kg/ha, an 88% decrease.
Nitrogen stored in forest floor material, calculated from
forest floor N content in Covington and Sackett (1984)
and Kaye and Hart (1998

kg/ha, an 1,800% increase. From all aboveground sources,
modeled N storage rose from approximately 1,230 kg/
ha in 1876 to 3,800 kg/ha in 1992. Increased vegetation
and fuel biomass therefore represented a 209% increase
in total N.
 
Effects of Restoration Treatments
 
The control treatment (Fig. 4) showed a gradual decline
in tree density due to self-thinning in the extremely
dense stands (
 
p
 
 
 
$
 
0.001), averaging 3,098 trees/ha at the
start of the simulation period. Basal area increased
slightly over most of the modeled period of 106 years,
but the change was not statistically significant (
 
p
 
 
 
"
 
0.210). Herbaceous production remained at minimal
levels throughout the modeled century (70–80 kg/ha).
Nitrogen allocation remained primarily in trees and for-
est floor biomass.
The full restoration treatment—thinning, fuel treat-
ment, and repeated burning at 4-year intervals—main-
tained a relatively constant density, but basal area in-
creased slightly over the modeled period. Neither change
was statistically significant (
 
p
 
 
 
"
 
 0.519 and 0.748, respec-
tively). The basal area increase may reflect growth ex-
pected from the relatively young trees that were retained

1980), gave nearly identical results in tree density and
basal area over the modeled period.
Presettlement-like conditions of forest structure, her-
baceous production, N storage, and fuel loading were
also observed immediately after treatment in the simu-
lated partial restoration—thinning only—area. In the
absence of fire, however, tree density rapidly increased
significantly (
 
p
 
 
 
$
 
 0.001), equaling the control area den-
sity within 65 years (Fig. 4). Basal area also increased
steadily (
 
p
 
 
 
$
 
 0.001), increasing 80% above the full resto-
ration treatment basal area as the additional young
trees grew. Herbaceous production declined to about
120 kg/ha, and fuel loads increased back to pretreat-
ment levels.
 
Discussion
 
Model Performance and Recent Ecological Changes
 
With appropriate modification of parameters based
on southwestern data, FIRESUM accurately modeled
changes in overstory and understory structure in an Ar-
izona ponderosa pine forest over the past century. Model
validation results were in close agreement with the data
from the study area (Table 2) and with the broader
changes observed consistently across the Southwest:
large increases in tree density and basal area (Cooper
1960; Covington & Moore 1994
 
a
 
,
 
b
 
; Fulé et al. 1997), real-
location of biomass and nitrogen from herbaceous plants
to trees (Arnold 1950; Covington et al. 1997), and accu-
mulation of forest floor biomass (Sackett 1979; Fulé &
Covington 1994).
Implications of these types of changes in forest struc-
ture have been widely discussed for crownfire hazard
(Covington & Moore 1994
 
b
 
), tree growth, mortality, and
regeneration (White 1985; Biondi 1996), and understory
production (Arnold 1950). The modeling results also
show that the substantial increases and reallocations in
biomass from herbs to trees have strongly impacted ni-
trogen (N) storage over the past century. Changes in the
sources of N have implications for herbivores. Nutrient
and biomass resources increased for those feeding di-
rectly on pine trees, such as 
 
Dendroctonus
 
 spp. and 
 
Ips
 
spp. (bark beetles), 
 
Sciuris abertii
 
 (tassel-eared squir-
rels), and 
 
Coloradia pandora
 
 (pandora moth). However,
the herbaceous understory represents 99% of the plant
species diversity at the study area (1 tree species, 96
grass, forb, and shrub species). These species, which
constitute the habitat resources for the nonarboreal in-
vertebrate and vertebrate herbivores, declined nearly
90% in biomass and N. A drop of this magnitude un-
doubtedly had impacts across trophic levels and food
webs of the forest.
Long-term simulations of presettlement conditions
provide an opportunity for assessing the range of natu-
in the restoration thinning to replace dead presettle-
ment trees. Although tree densities in the modeled full
restoration area were higher than the reconstructed pre-
settlement densities (about 160 trees/ha vs. 60 trees/
ha), approximately 70% of the modeled trees were be-
low 2-cm dbh, representing recurring regeneration that
was repeatedly thinned by the fires. Herbaceous pro-
duction was about 380 kg/ha in 2100, and N allocation
patterns were similar to those modeled for the preset-
tlement forest. Forest floor fuel levels stayed low due to
the repeated fires (data not shown). These results were
relatively insensitive to minor changes in fire regime.

intervals in the presettlement fire record (Dieterich

ral variability in forest structure. The concept of the range
of natural variability (RNV) provides a point of refer-
ence against which to evaluate changes in ecosystems
and a criterion for measuring the success of ecological
restoration treatments and other ecosystem manage-
ment experiments (Kaufmann et al. 1994; Morgan et al.
1994; Moore et al. 1999). In simplest terms, the range of
natural variability refers to the “composition, structure,
and dynamics of ecosystems before the influence of Eu-
ropean settlers” (Swanson et al. 1994). As a conservative
estimate, the plants and animals that evolved together
with characteristic climate and disturbance regimes for
many thousands of years should be well-adapted to
these conditions and presumably less well-adapted to
rapid anthropogenic alteration of ecosystems (Kaufmann
et al. 1994; Swanson et al. 1994). Without modeling, our
understanding of the temporal variability in forest struc-
ture is limited. Detailed quantitative evidence, such as
dendroecological data, photographs, and records are all
most available and most precise relatively close to the
present, such as the circa 1870–1880 time of fire exclu-
sion (Mast et al. 1999; Moore et al. 1999), whereas pro-
gressively much less detail can be reconstructed for
1780, 1680, and before. To some extent, however, recon-
struction of the RNV in forest structure in space can
also serve as a proxy for reconstruction in time. The
sampling of large landscapes includes a variety of dif-
ferences in aspect, elevation, soils, microhabitats, light-
ning intensities, and human occupancy. These factors
are likely to represent the majority of ecosystem influ-
ences over past times, although past proportions varied
depending on climatic factors and human population
and cultural changes.
The fluctuations in forest structure under long-term
simulation (500 years) had coefficients of variation rang-
ing from 4 (basal area) to 9% (tree density), calculated
from the averages for all 90 plots every 50 years. The
simulated forest structural changes over 500 years are
probably well within the RNV of presettlement forest
structure on this 4.7-ha study area. Over larger and more
diverse landscapes, more variable conditions would con-
tribute to greater structural diversity. For example, re-
construction of ponderosa pine and gambel oak forest
structure at the onset of fire exclusion in 1883 at Camp
Navajo, about 16 km west of Flagstaff, had coefficients
of variation of 76% in tree density and 85% in basal area
over a 558-ha area (Fulé et al. 1997). In this local exam-
ple, temporal variability at the GPNA site is much less
than presettlement spatial variability at Camp Navajo, a
logical outcome for a small plot compared to a land-
scape. As FIRESUM, FIRE-BGC, and other models are
refined in the Southwest, a more extensive examination
of temporal and spatial variability will be possible.
Although highly resolved mechanistic models like
FIRE-BGC hold tremendous potential for the future,
FIRESUM and other JABOWA-type models will proba-
bly remain useful because of their relatively low data
requirements and computational simplicity. For FIRE-
SUM to be applied in broader southwestern settings,
needed refinements will include local parameterization
of three conifer species included in the original FIRE-
SUM model, 
 
Pseudotsuga menziesii
 
 (Douglas fir), 
 
Abies
lasiocarp
 
 (subalpine fir

), and 
 
Picea pungens
 
 (Engelmann
spruce), and addition of several important new species:
 
Quercus gambeli
 
 (gambel oak 
 
i
 
), 
 
Abies concolor
 
 (white fir),
and 
 
Populus tremuloides
 
 (aspen). 
 
Pinus edulis
 
 (pinyon
pine) and 
 
Juniperus osteosperma
 
, 
 
J. monosperma
 
, and 
 
J.
deppeana
 
 (junipers) are also major species in southwest-
ern forests at xeric woodland ecotones. Modeling of
herbaceous production and forest floor dynamics will
also have to be modified for the variety of southwestern
environments. Application of the model over spatially
explicit landscapes will support investigation of large-
scale phenomena such as landscape connectivity and
spread of contagious processes. We also continue to de-
velop related software tools to support analysis of
model outputs.
 
Comparing Ecological Restoration Treatments
 
Ecological restoration is one of many ways in which the
negative effects of recent ecological changes could be
addressed. For example, a variety of tree thinning re-
gimes could address forest density, herbaceous produc-
tion goals, or fuelbreak objectives, while various fire
prescriptions or mechanical fuel treatments could be
designed to reduce forest floor fuels. The distinguishing
feature of an ecological restoration approach is close
emulation of a reference condition based on the historic,
indigenous ecosystem (Society for Ecological Restora-
tion 1993). The design of the GPNA restoration treat-
ments included close attention to the presettlement for-
est structure and spatial pattern, fire regime, reference
fuel and burning characteristics, native plant communi-
ties, and historic data from the site (Covington & Moore
1994
 
a
 
; Edminster & Olsen 1996; Covington et al. 1997;
Fulé et al. 1997; Mast et al. 1999).
Apart from the distinct differences between the treat-
ments observed in the simulation results, other ecologi-
cal factors beyond the scope of the model may affect the
forest. Maintenance of extremely high basal area in the
control is probably not possible for the next century; in
reality the control plots are most likely to experience
high tree mortality either from fire or insect or disease
pathogens (Wilson & Tkacz 1996). The highly stressed
presettlement trees in these crowded stands are already
showing evidence of significant growth declines (Biondi
et al. 1994; Biondi 1996) and high mortality rates (Sackett
et al. 1996; Mast et al. 1999). Essentially two alterna-
tives are possible: either the control can be successfully

protected from allogenic disturbance, as implied in the
FIRESUM analysis, or a stand-replacing disturbance
event will occur. Neither outcome is desirable from a
viewpoint that seeks to restore natural structure and
process. Fires or pathogens that kill trees over a small
area at one time may not be entirely outside the range
of frequent-fire regime conditions (e.g., see Fulé & Cov-
ington 1997 for an example in northern Mexico). Even
at the small scale of the control area (approximately 1.5
ha), however, the native forest was highly uneven-aged
(Mast et al. 1999). Because the experimental site is sur-
rounded by dense forest, wildfire in the control area
today would not be contained in a small area. Contem-
porary landscape-scale wildfires, such as the 6,500 ha
Hochderffer fire in 1996, ignited about 14 km north of
GPNA, have a far greater impact in terms of soil heat-
ing, erosion, plant mortality, and loss of seed sources
than presettlement fires.
Simulation of the two restoration treatments showed
early positive results, consistent with experimental ob-
servations at the study area of increased herbaceous
production (Covington et al. 1997), increased tree pho-
tosynthesis rates and resin flow, decreased tree mois-
ture stress (Feeney et al. 1998), and increased N trans-
formation and soil respiration rates (Kaye and Hart
1998
 
a
 
,
 
b
 
). Rapid gains in tree growth, crown develop-
ment, and herbaceous production were observed in the
first two decades following thinning of dense young
trees at a nearby Fort Valley study area (Ronco et al.
1985). However, the partial restoration treatment (thin-
ning only) rapidly diverged from the full restoration
treatment (thinning and burning) as trees became re-
established. Although tree regeneration can be sporadic
in the Southwest (Schubert 1974), tree establishment in
the absence of fire has occurred repeatedly since settle-
ment. Even in the absence of regional-scale events such
as the 1919 seed year (Savage et al. 1996), open forests
with seed trees eventually become denser. For example
Fulé et al. (1997) published a repeated photographic
scene from Camp Navajo, Arizona, showing seedlings
in 1942,that grew into dense sapling and pole stands by
1995. A thin-only treatment could be applied repeatedly
to control regeneration, and specific basal area targets
could even be maintained through commercial thinning
(Edminster & Olsen 1996). From a restoration perspec-
tive, such a management regime would be less desir-
able than full restoration because of the loss of the vari-
ety of ecological functions played by fire, as well as the
soil and habitat impacts of repeated mechanical entries.
Alternative views toward restoring fire-excluded for-
ests have been characterized as a debate between “pro-
cess restorationists”—who argue that restoration of key
ecological processes, especially fire, will eventually re-
store natural ecological conditions—and “structural res-
torationists”—who argue that forest structure and fuels
must be restored before reintroducing fire (Stephenson
1996). A restoration approach based on fire alone has
been popular in areas with management restrictions on
mechanical tree thinning, such as national parks (Par-
sons et al. 1986). In the Sierra Nevada, Stephenson (1996)
suggests that fire-only treatments in sequoia/mixed-
conifer forests can restore forest structure nearly as well
as thinning and burning. Modeling studies in the Sierra
Nevada have reached similar conclusions (van Wagten-
donk 1996; Miller & Urban 2000).
In contrast a prescribed fire-only treatment was not
tested at GPNA because more than two decades of ex-
tensive local experimentation have shown that the pon-
derosa pine forests in our study region are unlikely to
regain natural forest structure from burning alone. In-
terval burning studies were initiated on the Fort Valley
and Long Valley Experimental Forests in 1976 and 1977
to test the ecological effects of reintroducing low-intensity
fire at intervals ranging from 1 to 10 years (Harrington
& Sackett 1990). Prescribed fires reduced accumulated
fuel and mobilized forest floor nutrients (Covington &
Sackett 1992) and moderately stimulated tree growth
(Peterson et al. 1994) but thinned only a limited number
of small trees. Even trees as small as 10-cm dbh were
highly resistant to prescribed fire, so the study areas
have retained thousands of trees/ha, well above preset-
tlement reference levels. Techniques that increased fire
intensity, such as ring firing, led to higher mortality of
small trees but were difficult to apply due to the pres-
ence of continuous vertical fuels, the need for dry con-
ditions, and the desire to protect old-growth trees from
excessive scorch (Harrington & Sackett 1990). The long-
term interval burning studies remain in place, but more
comprehensive restoration experiments including both
structural and process restoration are the focus of cur-
rent research (Sackett et al. 1996; Fiedler et al. 1996;
Covington et al. 1997).
Additionally, a burn-only treatment was not in-
cluded in the FIRESUM analysis because fire modeling
capabilities are limited to surface fires, so simulation re-
sults can be misleading if fuels are actually available to
support crownfire. The fires we simulated burned in
presettlement or restored fuels, usually corresponding
to fire behavior fuel model 2 (grass and timber litter,
Anderson 1982). Forest structures were open and domi-
nated by large, fire-resistant trees with very few ladder
fuels such as shrubs or small trees. Under these circum-
stances, torching is rare and active crownfire essentially
impossible even under the relatively dry fire conditions
characteristic of the natural spring and summer fire re-
gime (Table 1). The surface fire module incorporated in
FIRESUM, based on the fire behavior model of Rother-
mel (1972), provided realistic estimates of fire intensity
for input to the seedling mortality and fuel reduction
modules. In contrast, passive and active crownfire be-

havior are likely under the same weather conditions in the
control fuels, which have high vertical fuel continuity, a
low crown base height, and high canopy density. Crown-
fires result from modeling stand structures like those of
the control area with the fire simulator FARSITE (Finney
1998), which incorporates crownfire-modeling capabili-
ties. Modeling a fire-only treatment with FIRESUM in the
control fuels would result in an underestimate of fire in-
tensity and an overestimate of the thinning effect of fire,
because fire behavior could be manipulated in the model
by reducing fuel moisture and increasing wind speed to
achieve any desired level of tree thinning. In reality, how-
ever, the control fuels can easily support crownfires even
under average fire season burning conditions.
A modeling study by Miller and Urban (2000) sug-
gested that relatively severe prescribed fires in the Si-
erra Nevada could approximate the effect of mechanical
thinning over a time span of a few centuries, because in-
tense burns will thin trees, repeated fire will regulate
new tree regeneration, and the excess established, fire-
resistant, overstory trees will eventually die, reestablish-
ing reference forest conditions. Even a regime of less-in-
tense “natural” fires is predicted to eventually achieve
the same goal (Miller & Urban 2000). For many south-
western ponderosa pine forests, however, such an out-
come is unlikely for two reasons. First, real fires severe
enough to thin 25–35-cm dbh pines are likely to crown
in unthinned stands and would be difficult to manage
under any circumstances. This outcome cannot be ac-
counted for in modeling, because the fire model in
FIRESUM as well as that used by Miller and Urban (2000)
have only surface fire capabilities, as discussed above.
Second, the long-term restoration approach implies that
dense stands will be able to persist for centuries with-
out destruction by wildfire. Recent fire trends in the
Southwest (Swetnam & Betancourt 1998), coupled with
increasingly strong El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
events such as the 1996 La Niña episode, during which
the largest and most costly crownfires in southwestern
history occurred, suggest that long-term maintenance
of dense forests is unlikely.
Repeated underburning would help reduce crown-
fire danger by lowering fuels in dense stands (van Wag-
tendonk 1996), but fine fuels reaccumulate quickly in
ponderosa stands (Davis et al. 1968; Harrington & Sackett
1990). Restoration treatments, which include biomass
removal, are more likely to provide long-term crown-
fire protection. Repeated burning is necessary in any
event, but as long as the burning units are appropri-
ately situated with respect to protection of surrounding
areas, burning in open forest conditions after thinning
will permit much wider prescription windows because
the risk of intense fire behavior is low.
In practice southwestern forest restoration will in-
clude a mix of practices as treatment areas expand from
small experimental sites. On many public and private
lands, mechanical thinning offers the combined benefits
of rapid restoration, crownfire protection, and the op-
portunity to offset treatment costs to some extent with
the value of small-diameter trees. Pure ecological resto-
ration goals (restoration 
 
sensu stricto
 
, Aronson et al.
1993) are unlikely to be adopted uniformly; instead,
mixtures of several thinning prescriptions and set-asides
will lead to diverse landscapes on large-scale projects.
On lands such as parks and wilderness areas, where
management objectives seek to minimize mechanical
activities, thinning may be limited to the minimal level
needed to safely reintroduce fire or protect boundaries
or developments. Prescribed fire will be central in every
restoration approach—underscoring the fact that the
term “structural restoration” is a misnomer. As shown
by the partial-restoration treatment simulation, a suc-
cessful restoration approach depends on reinstating
and maintaining the full spectrum of natural processes,
including demographic and successional changes, and
disturbance. Throughout the Southwest, another kind
of restoration is increasingly needed: reestablishment of
indigenous ecosystems on severely burned landscapes.
It is important to test a variety of restoration treatments
while we can still intervene to limit the damage.
