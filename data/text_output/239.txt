The tassel-eared squirrel (Sciurus aberti) is dependent on ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) for food and cover
and is likely to be affected by management treatments intended to restore currently dense ponderosa pine forests
to presettlement, more-open stand structure. We used radiotelemetry to determine how restoration treatments
affected habitat use by tassel-eared squirrels. Mean 50% fixed kernel core areas and 85% fixed kernel home
ranges were significantly smaller in winter (core 5 1.1 ha; home range 5 5.1 ha) than nonwinter (core 5
3.48 ha; home range 5 13.81 ha), and squirrels selected untreated forests and areas with high (51–75%) canopy
cover for these winter areas. During nonwinter core areas and home ranges expanded to include treated areas
with high canopy cover (51–75%). Squirrels placed the majority of winter nests in areas with .51% canopy
cover and high (0.0601–0.0819 kg/m3) crown bulk density. Given the apparent importance of denser, untreated
patches and treated areas with canopy cover of 51–75% in winter, we suggest retaining some areas with these
characteristics where it is compatible with other forest management objectives.

Over the past 150 years ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)
forests of the American Southwest have shifted from relatively
open, park-like stands with clumps of large-diameter (old-
growth) trees (Cooper 1960; White 1985) to dense stands with
many small-diameter trees and very little open area (Coving-
ton and Moore 1994). In part due to the threat these dense
stands pose as foci for high-intensity wildfires, management of
pine forests in the Southwest has shifted to restoring
presettlement stand structure via mechanical thinning and
returning low-intensity fire at intervals appropriate to this fire-
adapted landscape (Allen et al. 2002). This approach can
reduce basal area by up to 66%, reduce trees per acre by up to
88% (Fule´ et al. 2001), and allow the herbaceous understory to
reestablish (Moore et al. 2006). Although these treatments can
create tree densities and spatial patterns resembling those
present during presettlement, most restored stands will require
considerable time to develop a dominant old-growth tree
component. Consequently, restoration could alter habitat
quality for mammals associated with ponderosa pine forests
for an extended period after treatment.
The tassel-eared squirrel (Sciurus aberti) is dependent on
ponderosa pine for both food and cover (Dodd et al. 2003;
Farentinos 1972; Keith 1965). This squirrel’s diet is composed
almost exclusively of ponderosa pine tissue (seeds, cones, and
inner bark) or plants and fungi closely associated with
ponderosa pine (Austin 1990; Keith 1965; Snyder 1992;
States et al. 1988; Stephenson 1975). Tasseled-ear squirrels
build both winter and nonwinter nests exclusively in the upper
branches of large (37.5- to 57.5-cm diameter at breast height
[DBH]) ponderosa pines (Halloran and Bekoff 1994; Snyder
and Linhart 1994). Although squirrels depend upon the pine
throughout the year, winter is especially critical, because their
primary winter food source is the inner bark of pine twigs
(Hall 1981; Keith 1965) collected from a subset of trees that
differ in mineral and terpene concentration from trees not fed
upon (Farentinos et al. 1981; Snyder 1992; Zhang and States
1991). The chemical composition of feed trees is not
correlated with obvious physical attributes of the tree (Faren-
tinos et al. 1981), but differences apparently can be detected
by squirrels, because trees are consistently used from year to
year (Hall 1981; Keith 1965). These feed trees are typically
found in clumps that are distributed throughout a forest patch

(Linhart 1989; States et al. 1988). The ability of a squirrel
to access these clumps via interlocking canopy corridors
becomes increasingly important during winter when snow
accumulation can impede ground travel and increase squirrel
susceptibility to predation (Stephenson and Brown 1980).
Forest restoration based on tree removal potentially could alter
the availability of feed trees or reduce access to them by
reducing the amount of interlocking canopies.
Given the dependence of tassel-eared squirrels on ponder-
osa pine, previous studies have suggested that landscape-scale
restoration treatments could decrease tassel-eared squirrel
density and recruitment if treatments caused overall basal area
and number of interlocking canopy trees to fall below critical
levels (Dodd et al. 2006). In addition to reducing food and nest
site availability, restoration could increase predation by
reducing the amount of interlocking canopy that squirrels
use as pathways for escaping predators (Austin 1990; Dodd
et al. 2003). Although some have suggested that up to 75% of
a forested landscape can be treated and still provide suitable
squirrel habitat if treatments are applied as a mosaic of patches
(Dodd et al. 2006), no studies have examined how individual
squirrels respond to forests where restoration treatments have
been conducted.
Our objectives were to evaluate seasonal home range and
quantify habitat selection by tassel-eared squirrels in a treated
landscape. We predicted that squirrels would select home
ranges that had a higher than expected proportion of habitat
with stand characteristics like those of untreated forest, and
that nests would be placed predominantly in untreated areas
during both winter and nonwinter seasons.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study area.—The study site was located in and adjacent to
the Coconino National Forest’s 2,003-ha Fort Valley Exper-
imental Forest (35u169N, 111u439W) established in 1909 in
northern Arizona. In 1931 study plots within the area were
protected from logging, fuel-wood cutting, and other uses, and
fire was suppressed in the area (Olberding 2000). Fort Valley
is dominated by postsettlement 13- to 41-cm DBH, pole-size
ponderosa pines interspersed with groups of mature, preset-
tlement trees and thickets of young saplings. Located at
2,300 m elevation 15 km northwest of Flagstaff, the study area
lies within the 3.4-million hectare ponderosa pine belt of
north-central Arizona and New Mexico (Mast et al. 1999).
From November 2005 to July 2007 total precipitation
measured 61 cm, with a total of 240 cm of snowfall, compared
to annual mean precipitation of 57 cm (Fule´ et al. 2001). Soils
within the area are volcanic in origin (Mast et al. 1999).
Contracted thinning and burning restoration treatments on
the study sites began in 1998 and initially were completed in fall
2000 (Fule´ et al. 2001). Treatments were carried out with
mechanical thinning and based on site-specific presettlement
tree density ratios. Treatments consisted of no thinning
(control), low thinning (3–6 trees left for every presettlement
tree or remnant tree material), medium thinning (2–4 trees left),
and high thinning (1.5–3 trees left—Abella and Covington
2004). Resulting mean tree density (trees/acre) on treatment
blocks ranged from 98 on low-thinning to 69 on medium-
thinning and 57 on high-thinning treatments (Fule´ et al. 2001).
Treatments were carried out on 4 randomly assigned ,17-ha
blocks located within a 10-km2 area that varied in topography
from flat to 15% slope (Fule´ et al. 2001; Skov et al. 2005). In
addition, a combination of these treatments was applied to 4
additional blocks of approximately 40 ha each. Irregularly
shaped, untreated areas that followed drainages were left as
wildlife corridors throughout the study area. The resulting
landscape was spatially heterogeneous, with canopy cover and
crown bulk density that varied widely across the area.
Trapping and marking animals.—Research described herein
was carried out following the guidelines established by the
American Society of Mammalogists for the use of wild
mammals in research (Gannon et al. 2007). From November
2005 to December 2005 and in April 2006 we captured
squirrels using wire-mesh box traps (model 202; Tomahawk
Live Trap Co., Tomahawk, Wisconsin) baited with shelled,
unsalted, raw peanuts. To incorporate several combinations of
forest restoration treatment patches and untreated patches we
systematically placed six 4 3 10 trap grids on the study area
(Fig. 1A): 2 grids on the western portion (study area A) and
4 on the eastern portion (study area B). All trap grids
incorporated some treated and untreated areas, and both study
areas were a mosaic of treated and untreated. Traps were
spaced 50 m apart, set in the morning, and checked before
sunset during weekdays. We trapped for 3 months. We
immobilized captured squirrels with an inhalation anesthetic,
isoflurane (IsoFlo; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago,
Illinois), and fitted squirrels with a uniquely numbered ear
tag (National Band and Tag, Newport, Kentucky) and a 15-g
very-high-frequency radiotransmitter (model CHP-3P; Telo-
nics, Mesa, Arizona). In all cases transmitters were ,3% of
body mass. We determined the sex and weighed each captured
squirrel and classified squirrels weighing .550 g as adults
(Dodd et al. 2003; Farentinos 1972; Keith 1965). We released
squirrels at the capture site after a 15-min anesthetic recovery
period.
Radiotracking and range areas.—We used a directional,
handheld antenna to track squirrels from December 2005 to
July 2007, obtaining visual locations for each squirrel 2
times per week. We allocated tracking effort equally across
morning, afternoon, and late-afternoon periods. We recorded
each animal’s location using Universal Transverse Mercator
coordinates obtained from a handheld global positioning
system unit after the unit achieved an accuracy of 8 m and
noted if the squirrel was in a nest. In winter 2005–2006 we
tracked 7 adults (4 females and 3 males) and 3 juveniles
(1 female and 2 males). The following nonwinter (2006) we
considered the 1 surviving male juvenile squirrel to be an
adult; thus, we tracked 10 adults (5 females and 5 males). For
winter 2006–2007 this group of 10 squirrels was reduced by
mortality to 9 (5 females and 4 males), and we tracked them
for the remainder of the study.

We partitioned location data into 2 seasons, winter (1 De-
cember–31 March) and nonwinter (1 April–30 November),
based on seasonal shifts in squirrel diet. Squirrels rely on inner
bark in winter months, and fungi and pine seeds become more
important in nonwinter periods (States et al. 1988; Stephenson
1975). For each season (2 winter and 2 nonwinter) we used
ArcView 3.3 Home Range Extension (HRE—Rogers and Carr
1998) with a least-squares cross-validation smoothing param-
eter (Seaman et al. 1999; Seaman and Powell 1996; Worton
1995) to estimate 50% fixed kernel seasonal core areas and
85% fixed kernel seasonal ranges (Worton 1989). We
determined the minimum number of locations needed to cause
fixed kernel ranges to reach an asymptote (Seaman et al.
1999). Range size stabilized with 20 locations, and we
subsequently used squirrels with 20 locations/season for
further analyses. We used Student’s t-test blocked by season in
JMP 7 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina) to examine
differences in core area and seasonal range size between sexes
and ages across years. Data were tested for normality using
Shapiro–Wilk’s
test
and
log-transformed
to
meet
this
assumption. We used a Welch analysis of variance (Welch
1938) to test for homogeneity of variance (JMP 7; SAS
Institute Inc.,).
Geographic
information
system
layers.—We
obtained
canopy cover and crown bulk density (the sum weight of
foliage and fine branch wood often expressed in kg/m3)
geographic information system vegetation layers from Forest-
ERA (Forest Ecosystem Restoration Analysis, Flagstaff,
Arizona). Canopy cover is an important parameter for
squirrels because interconnected canopies provide travel
corridors between feed trees that are more protected from
predators than the ground (Dodd et al. 1998, 2003, 2006;
Prather et al. 2006); thus we used this layer as an indicator of
food accessibility (i.e., as canopy cover increased in an area,
so too would a squirrel’s ability to access food resources
efficiently and safely). Crown bulk density is an estimate of
live crown mass, including fine branch wood for individual
trees and crown mass density for a specific area (Keyser and
Smith 2010). We reasoned that as the amount of live crown
mass and branch wood increased so too would the amount of
inner bark. We therefore assumed that this parameter would
reflect canopy quality, both in terms of amount of food
available in the form of fine branches and canopy cover
protection from predators and the elements. ForestERA
constructed geographic information system layers from the
same period as our trapping and telemetry. The canopy cover
layer was created from 2005 digital orthophotographs with a
1-m resolution and crown bulk density from fall 2006
(September–October) Landsat TM images (Forest Ecosystem
Restoration Analysis) with a pixel resolution of 30 m. We
scaled both layers to 60-m pixels from their original resolution
and used linear regression analysis between derived crown
bulk density and data collected at two hundred forty 0.04-ha
plots as an indicator of how accurately derived measures of
crown bulk density reflected those on the ground (Fule´ et al.
2001). We plotted residuals to confirm that linear regression
was appropriate for this analysis. A previous study (Xu et al.
2006) validated the accuracy of canopy cover estimates on this
study area. We classified areas as treated if trees had been
removed mechanically, regardless of final tree density, and
untreated if no trees had been removed mechanically since the
1930s.
Analysis.—Habitat analysis based on the comparison of use
versus availability depends on a clearly defined definition of
habitat available (Aebischer et al. 1993). We used squirrel

behavior to define availability (Buskirk and Millspaugh 2006)
and examined use within the hierarchical 2nd, 3rd, and 4th
orders (Johnson 1980). We estimated 2nd-order availability at
home-range scale (Johnson 1980), based on the relative
amounts of treated and untreated area and amount of each
canopy cover and crown bulk density category within the
minimum convex polygon created from all radiolocations of
squirrels captured in each study area (Guthery et al. 2005). We
estimated 2nd-order use as either the composition within the
50% fixed kernel core area or within the 85% fixed kernel
home range. This analysis therefore compared composition
within each individual 50% core area or 85% kernel home
range to the composition within the broader study area. We
evaluated 3rd- and 4th-order selection (habitat features within
the home range—Johnson 1980) by considering the habitat
within an individual animal’s seasonal 85% fixed kernel home
range as available and habitat at each individual radiolocation
(3rd order) or nest site location (4th order) as used.
For forest structure habitat characteristics (canopy cover
and crown bulk density) at both 2nd- and 3rd-order scales we
used compositional analysis (F) to determine if habitat use
differed from random (P , 0.05), and to rank habitat
preference when statistically significant differences existed
between availability and use (Aebischer et al. 1993; Aitchison
1986).

this

(2004), substituting values of 0.007 rather than 0.0 for habitat
classes where a squirrel was never located. We used chi-
square analysis in JMP 7 (SAS Institute Inc.) to determine if
use differed from random (P , 0.05) for 4th-order selection
and for treatment selection at the 2nd and 3rd orders.
RESULTS
Size of range areas.—We captured 18 squirrels, 15 adults
(9 females and 6 males) and 3 juveniles (1 female and
2 males). Six of the squirrels were captured in study area A
and 12 in study area B, which was proportional to the number
of trap grids in each study area. We found no significant
differences in range estimates between ages or sexes and
therefore pooled all squirrels within a season for each level of
analysis. The mean 50% fixed kernel core area for winter
(1.10 ha, SD 5 0.68 ha) was 3 times smaller than nonwinter
(3.48 ha, SD 5 2.59 ha; t10 5 2.85, P , 0.001). Likewise, the
mean 85% fixed kernel home range for winter (5.11 ha, SD 5
3.38 ha) was .60% smaller than nonwinter (13.81 ha, SD 5
6.72 ha; t12 5 3.83, P 5 0.001).
Selection.—The geographic information system layers accu-
rately reflected on-the-ground measurements (canopy cover:
r2 5 0.53, y 5 1.02x; and crown bulk density: r2 5 0.71,
y 5 0.91x). Squirrels selected untreated areas more than
expected from availability when composition of home ranges
was compared to that available within each study area in both
winter (x2
1 5 11.51, P , 0.001) and nonwinter (x2
1 5 3.80,
P 5 0.05), but when composition of core areas was compared
to that within individual home ranges, untreated areas were
used more than expected only in winter (x2
1 5 15.00, P ,
0.001; Fig. 2). In general, squirrel winter core areas were in
untreated areas (Fig. 1). Squirrels used areas with canopy
cover of 51–75% more than expected and canopy cover of 0–
30% less than expected in both seasons (winter: F3,15 5 7.17,
P , 0.003; nonwinter: F3,7 5 34.00, P , 0.0002) when
canopy composition within home ranges was compared to the
composition across the study area, but only in winter (F3,15 5
15.28, P , 0.0001) when core areas were compared to
availability assessed within individual home ranges (Fig. 2).
We found no evidence of selection for crown bulk density
categories at the home-range (2nd-order) level of selection in
any season (winter: F2,16 5 1.72, P . 0.21; nonwinter: F2,8 5
0.55, P . 0.59) Likewise, we found no support for selection
for treated compared to untreated areas (winter: x2
1 5 0.93,
P 5 0.33; nonwinter: x2
1 5 1.04, P 5 0.31), or specific
canopy cover (winter: F3,15 5 0.74, P . 0.19; nonwinter:
F3,7 5 0.96, P . 0.96) or crown bulk density (winter:
F2,16 5 0.89, P . 0.40; nonwinter: F2,8 5 1.04, P . 0.40)
categories in either season when selection was based on
individual radiolocations (3rd-order selection).
Although squirrels placed nests in treated and untreated
areas as expected based on availability (winter: x2
1 5 1.62,
P 5 0.20; nonwinter: x2
1 5 2.63, P 5 0.10), selection for
canopy cover and crown bulk density occurred within these
categories during both winter and nonwinter seasons (Fig. 3),
and the availability of these categories was reduced by
treatment (Fig. 4). During winter, squirrels selected nest
placement sites (4th-order selection) with canopy cover (x2
1
5 7.88, P 5 0.005) and crown bulk density (x2
1 5 4.53, P 5
0.03) that differed from availability, placing the majority of
nests in areas with 51–75% canopy cover and 0.06–0.08 kg/m3
crown bulk density. For nonwinter, squirrels again selected
nest sites with canopy cover (x2
1 5 6.23, P 5 0.01) and crown
bulk density (x2
1 5 4.86, P 5 0.03) that differed from
availability. However, for this season, squirrels selected areas
with canopy cover of 76–100% and crown bulk density of
0.06–0.08 kg/m3.
Overall, tassel-eared squirrels in our study disproportion-
ately used areas that had either not been treated or had
received forest treatments that resulted in higher canopy cover
when compared to other treatments. Squirrels underutilized
areas that had low canopy cover and crown bulk density
whether they occurred as natural openings in untreated forest
or as heavily thinned areas.
DISCUSSION
Our findings are consistent with other studies that found that
areas with high basal area and high canopy cover supported
1024

higher squirrel densities (Dodd et al. 2006; Patton et al. 1985;
Trowbridge and Lawson 1942). Although tassel-eared squir-
rels selected for untreated patches in both seasons, this pattern
was strongest during winter when squirrels selected untreated
forest patches as core use areas. Squirrels placed nests in areas
with high canopy cover and crown bulk density in both
untreated and treated areas. We hypothesize that these areas of
higher canopy cover and greater bulk density provided
squirrels with feed trees with interlocking canopies and nest
locations that had thermal and structural properties necessary
for buffering against wind and temperature extremes during
this critical winter period (Golightly and Ohmart 1978).
Snowfall during both years of our study (113 cm in 2005–2006
and 129 cm in 2006–2007) was approximately one-half of the
30-year average (277 cm; National Climatic Data Center,
www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/ncde.html, accessed 4 August 2009),
suggesting that our results are representative of relatively mild
winters.
In
winters
with
heavier
snowfall
interlocking
canopies might become more important as escape routes and
as travel pathways to access feed trees.
Although squirrels underutilized treated areas and areas with
low canopy cover based on availability, squirrels still used these
areas during both winter and nonwinter seasons, and some
squirrels had core ranges that fell entirely within treated areas.
This might have been driven in part by squirrels using more
open sites because trees in these areas have greater access to
nutrients and water and thereby increase cone production during
the summer (Dodd et al. 1998). In addition, treatment
prescriptions in our study area varied both across and within
treatments because they were based on site-specific historical
evidence of presettlement conditions. As a result, treated areas
varied considerably in tree density and canopy cover. Although
the total area with ranges of canopy cover and crown bulk
density that squirrels favored was lower overall in treated areas,
some remained that squirrels likely were able to exploit
(e.g., nest placement within treatments). In this respect our
study is different from those that studied squirrel response in
large areas receiving a single treatment prescription that reduced
all areas to the same specific stem density, diameter at breast

height, or canopy cover value (Patton et al. 1985; Pederson et al.
1987; Trowbridge and Lawson 1942). An important caveat of
our study was that treated areas were surrounded by untreated
areas and might have been too small (X¯ 5 14 ha) to include
enough individual home ranges (,14 ha per individual) to
assess the effects of large-scale treatment, a situation not
uncommon in experimental tests of the impacts of forest
restoration (Block
et al. 2001). However, the disproportionate use of higher density,
untreated areas, especially in winter, by the majority of our
squirrels suggests that without retention of untreated or higher
tree density areas, squirrel abundance likely would decline in
areas of extensive restoration treatments.
Current views that ponderosa pine forests were historically
more open and park-like (Allen et al. 2002; Cooper 1960;
Covington and Moore 1994; Mast et al. 1999; White 1985),
combined with consistent findings that squirrel density and
recruitment are linked to high canopy closure (Dodd et al. 1998,
2006; Patton 1975, 1984), suggest that presettlement squirrel
populations were likely lower than they are currently. Restora-
tion treatments designed to recreate presettlement conditions
might reduce squirrel populations. Initial mechanical thinning
can create tree densities and spatial patterns similar to those
present during presettlement but cannot replace large, old-
growth trees removed by historical and contemporary commer-
cial logging that could be of considerable importance to
squirrels. Squirrels are a management indicator species,
perform important ecosystem functions such as dispersal of
mycorrhizal fungal spores (Kotter and Farentinos 1984), act as
prey for sensitive species (e.g., northern goshawk—Reynolds
et al. 1992), and are a popular small game species. Where
management goals include maintaining squirrel populations at
or near current levels, our results suggest that retention of
untreated areas or incorporation of treated areas with high
canopy cover should be considered. Site-specific restoration
treatments commonly include extensive field surveys for
evidence of presettlement trees. These efforts could be
augmented to benefit squirrels by identifying feed and nest
trees to be retained after treatment.
