Integrating traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) with western science and modeling tools can enhance not
only the delivery of culturally important species, but also community support and overall eﬀectiveness of
management. This paper presents a case study of co-producing usable science integrating TEK on a culturally
important species with a modeling tool, Climate-Forest Vegetation Simulator (C-FVS). The Mescalero Apache
tribe (southwestern USA) conduct a coming of age ceremony for young women who follow a traditional way of
life. In order to conduct this ceremony, tall, thin teepee poles made from Douglas-ﬁr trees are needed. Douglas-
ﬁr trees capable of producing teepee poles are a culturally important resource for the Mescalero Apache tribe.
We interacted with medicine people, tribal members, and forest managers to gain insight on characteristics of
teepee pole stands. We established thirty, 400 m2 circular plots with nested 100 m2 regeneration plots in teepee
pole producing stands to characterize composition, structure, age, growth rates, and fuels. Teepee pole produ-
cing stands occupy an elevation range from 2012 to 2561 m, slopes of 3–43%, and aspects from NW to NE. The
stands consist of dense, relatively old trees dominated by Douglas-ﬁr, with other species of trees usually present
as a minor component. Douglas-ﬁrs in teepee pole producing stands averaged 1255 ± 99 trees per ha (TPH),
basal area 31.7 ± 1.5 m2/ha, and 18.5 ± 0.5 cm quadratic mean diameters (QMD). Douglas-ﬁr trees in teepee
pole producing stands were most commonly 75–100 years old with diameters at breast height (DBH) ranging
from 5.1 to 25.4 cm. In order to assess future trajectories of teepee pole stands, we applied C-FVS which in-
corporates the eﬀects of climate change scenarios over the next 100 years. We compared three standard sce-
narios ranging from moderate to severe climate change: Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5, 6.0,
and 8.5. Simulated future forests at the current plot locations even under the most mild climate change scenario
(RCP 4.5) did not contain Douglas-ﬁr after a century of modeling. Complete forest mortality was predicted under
RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5. Comparing bioclimatic niche modeling of Douglas-ﬁr with downscaled future climate
scenarios indicated that the species would have to be planted at least 305 m higher to maintain 21st century
viability under RCP 4.5 and 6.0, or at least 610 m higher under RCP 8.0. The characterization of current teepee
pole producing stands and simulations of future eﬀects of climate change provide useful information to the
Mescalero Apache Tribe to support management decisions on how they would like to preserve this cultural
important resource.
1. Introduction
Forests provide a wide variety of ecosystem services, including
plants and animals supporting livelihoods and cultural traditions, but
are under threat from loss of resilience with increasing temperature and
decreasing precipitation (McDowell et al., 2016). Native American
communities are particularly vulnerable to changing forest conditions
as their values and identiﬁes are linked to the natural landscape
(Voggesser et al., 2013). Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) is a
cumulative body of knowledge, practice, and belief about the re-
lationships among living beings and with their environment (Berkes
et al., 2000) and guides the selection, management, and uses of cultu-
rally important species. TEK is often in the form of qualitative de-
scriptions passed on through oral and experiential cultural transmis-
sions, which make it challenging to incorporate into forest inventory
and planning eﬀorts (Hummel and Lake, 2015). Thus, ensuring sus-
tainable access to culturally important resources may require devel-
oping unique climate adaptation strategies (Voggesser et al., 2013) by

integrating knowledge from diﬀerent sources and traditions (Bohensky
and Maru, 2011). Integrating TEK with western science and modeling
tools can enhance not only the delivery of the target species, but also
community support and overall eﬀectiveness of management (Emery
et al., 2014; Hummel and Lake, 2015; Costanza et al., 2017).
In south-central New Mexico, USA, the Mescalero Apache Tribe
conducts a Coming-of-Age Ceremony for young women who follow a
traditional way of life. This 12-day rite of passage ceremony marks the
transition from girlhood into womanhood (Mescalero Apache Tribe
2018). As a key religious rite that the tribe observes today, the cere-
mony also serves a social function of gathering the tribal members who
may live far away (Farrer, 1987). The maiden goes through a series of
ceremonies led by medicine people to ensure that she lives a prosperous
life. The preparation for a ceremony starts with selecting and harvesting
trees to construct teepees and arbors, which are built with evergreen
poles and oak branches (Farrer, 1987). Teepees are used for storage,
cooking and living before, during, and after the ceremony. Each teepee
requires 12 evergreen poles (Farrer, 1987). A ceremony can have 3–4
teepees with 1 “big teepee”. One medicine man stated that he con-
ducted an average of nine ceremonies per summer, which would re-
quire up to 324–432 teepee poles. Poles are made exclusively from
Rocky Mountain Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.)
Franco), although conversations with medicine men indicated that
other tree species such as aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) may have
been used long ago. Rocky Mountain Douglas-ﬁr can grow up to
35–46 m, reach about 0.9 m DBH, and can be found on cool, dry, in-
terior mountain ranges from New Mexico up into Canada (Hermann
and Lavender, 1999). It is smaller than the coastal variety (Pseudotsuga
menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. menziesii), that can reach 76 m tall and is
found from California to British Columbia. Douglas-ﬁr trees in the
Southwest are found in warm/dry mixed conifer forests (Romme et al.,
2009) which are vulnerable to warming climate and associated dis-
turbances (Allen et al., 2010; Flatley and Fulé, 2016).
The Mescalero Apache Tribal Lands (MATL) are located in the
Sacramento Mountain Range of New Mexico. The dominant forest type
on MATL is warm/dry mixed conifer. Surface ﬁres burned with sub- to
multi-decadal frequency prior to Euro-American settlement (late
1800 s) but ﬁres have been excluded for over a century (A. Azpeleta
et
al.,
unpublished
manuscript),
leading
to
several
large,
un-
characteristically severe crownﬁres in the 20th century (Historical
Research Associates, 1981). Management of MATL forests is conducted
jointly between the Bureau of Indian Aﬀairs and the Tribe’s Division of
Resource Management and Protection. Silvicultural treatments, fuels
reduction operations, and prescribed burning are carried out on over
2023 ha annually. Much of the commercial forest area is managed for
low-density, crownﬁre-resistant, eﬃcient wood ﬁber production fea-
turing Douglas-ﬁr and ponderosa pine (Hoyt et al., 2016). However, an
important core objective for Mescalero forest management includes the
incorporation of traditional, religious, and cultural forest values. In the
speciﬁc case of teepee pole production, the incorporation of traditional
values creates a paradox for forest management. Contemporary forest
management aims to restore and maintain open forests similar to his-
torical conditions, but simultaneously the Mescalero Apache Tribe
seeks to sustain patches of high-density Douglas-ﬁr stands for teepee
pole production. Recently, people who follow a traditional Mescalero
Apache way of life have expressed concerns with silvicultural treat-
ments such as thinning in teepee pole stands, leading the Tribal Council
to identify teepee poles as a resource of concern in tribal government
resolutions (#13–20) and to seek research on sustaining them for the
future.
The study was initiated by a request from the tribe based on the
long-term relationship that the researchers built with the tribe during
previous research projects and continuous two-way communications to
produce actionable science for the tribe, which are the key principles
for co-producing usable climate science (Raymond et al, 2010; Meadow
et al., 2015). The tribal stakeholders, including tribal and BIA forest
managers, medicine men, and tribal members who conduct ceremonies,
provided insight into the ecological, cultural, and management issues
surrounding teepee pole producing stands. Based on this information,
we sampled teepee pole stands across Mescalero’s forested lands with
the following objectives: (1) characterize the: morphology (DBH,
height, and form) of culturally desired teepee poles, composition,
structure, age, growth rates, and fuels of current teepee pole stands; (2)
apply forest simulation modeling to forecast teepee pole stand devel-
opment and sustainability under alternative management and climate
scenarios; and (3) provide the data for the tribe to develop plans for
future management of this important cultural resource.

2. Methods
2.1. Study area
Mescalero Apache Tribal Lands, in south-central New Mexico cover
186,430 ha and are 85% forested with 60,703 ha classiﬁed as com-
mercial forest (Hoyt et al., 2016) (Fig. 1). The forest is managed jointly
between the Bureau of Indian Aﬀairs (BIA) and Mescalero’s Division of
Resource Management and Protection (DRMP). Mescalero’s Tribal
Council also inﬂuences forest management by including cultural values
and philosophies that protect Mescalero’s natural resources. The wes-
tern side of MATL includes elevations ranging from 1828 m to 3658 m
while the eastern side is lower in elevation, and has a more arid climate,
dominated by woodlands (Hoyt et al., 2016; Hoagland, 2016). Soils in
the Sacramento Mountains are classiﬁed as mostly Argiborolls, derived
from limestone and siltstone parent material (Kaufmann et al., 1998).
Average annual high temperatures are 18.5 °C while average low tem-
peratures are 1.9 °C. Average annual precipitation is 55.5 cm, with
average annual snowfall of 78.7 cm (Ruidoso Weather Station, https://
wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?nmmesc).
Desert-grassland vegetation types dominated by shrubs and grasses
are found in the eastern portions of MATL and overstory vegetation
types include pinyon pine (Pinus edulis Engelm), Rocky Mountain ju-
niper
(Juniperus
scopulorum Sarg.),
alligator
juniper
(Juniperus
deppeana Steud.), in mid elevations sites from 1676 m to 2133 m. Pine
forests occur around 2133 m elevational zone with ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum Englm.) and Gambel oak (Quercus
gambelii Nutt) as the dominant tree species. Mixed conifer forests occur
on north facing aspects between 2286 m and 2743 m and are dominated
by Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Besissn.) Franco),
white ﬁr (Abies concolor (Gord. & Glend.) Lindl. ex Hildebr), south-
western white pine (Pinus strobiformis Engelm.), aspen (Populus tremu-
loides Michx.) as well as ponderosa pine and Gambel oak. At the higher
elevations above 2591 m, spruce-ﬁr and alpine meadows dominate the
landscape.
2.2. Inputs from tribal members, medicine people, and foresters
To share insight on the characteristics of teepee pole producing
stands, several Mescalero Apache medicine men oﬀered to describe the
process of selecting teepee poles. Their recurring theme was respect for
what was being taken from the land (J. Padilla and A. Comanche,
personal communication, 2016–2017). Teepee poles are selected from
dense patches of Douglas-ﬁr trees ranging from 7 to 12 cm in diameter,
20–25 cm for a “big teepee”. The collection of teepee poles must be
accessible by road because collection of poles must be completed by
noon on the teepee construction day. Teepee pole trees should be free of
any deformities such as crook, sweep, or fork, or illnesses or wounds
visible on the trees. When a teepee pole is selected, it is ﬁrst named by
the medicine man and blessed with pollen. Then the teepee poles are
felled in each of the cardinal directions with an axe. Once felled, poles
are measured from the top of the tree 8–10 axe handles down (ap-
proximately 5.5–7 m).
2.3. Field methods
A total of 122 GPS located points and 76 treatment exclusion
polygons of currently known locations for teepee pole producing stands
identiﬁed by medicine people and tribal foresters were provided to the
research team by the GIS staﬀfrom BIA Forestry. We divided the MATL
into 4 quadrants and randomly selected plot locations from each
quadrant. Each point was veriﬁed on the ground based on the presence
of teepee pole-size Douglas-ﬁr trees as well as the stumps of cut teepee
poles.
We sampled a total of thirty teepee pole stands, with three pilot
plots in 2015 and the remainder in 2016. Although some sites are
genuine “stands” ranging up to several ha in size, in many cases the
area of teepee poles was not much larger than the measurement plot.
The number of plots was limited by the intensive measurements re-
quired. We measured all trees over breast height (1.37 m) to fully
capture the tree diameter range including small-diameter teepee poles,
rather than using a DBH cutoﬀto reduce the number of trees measured.
We also carried out a substantial amount of tree coring, in many cases
coring repeatedly to reach pith. The intensive nature of the measure-
ments and the resources available set the plot number at 30. The thirty
plots represent a sample of over 15% of the teepee pole locations. A few
mapped coordinates that were supposed to be teepee pole stands turned
out to be erroneous, while some unmapped locations doubtless exist.
Nonetheless, an approximately 15% sample provides a reasonable es-
timate for the Tribe.
We sampled all trees above breast height (1.37 m) on 400 m2 plots
(11.28 m radius), a commonly-used size for detailed forest measure-
ments in the Southwest (Waltz et al., 2003), but still small enough to ﬁt
within a relatively homogenous teepee pole patch. We took measure-
ments in the plots of tree species, condition class (live; declining; recent
snag; loose bark snag; clean snag; snag broken above breast height; snag
broken below breast height; dead and down tree; cut stump; and cut
teepee pole), diameter at breast height (DBH), diameter at stump height
(DSH), total height, crown base height, live crown ratio and dwarf
mistletoe rating (0–6). Tree condition classes were assigned based on a
tree, snag, and log classiﬁcation system (Thomas, 1979), with the ex-
ception of the category “cut teepee pole” which is unique for this cul-
turally relevant study. Trees with damage or deformities that could
aﬀect selection as a teepee pole were noted. In the three preliminary
plots collected in 2015, all trees within the 400 m2 circular plot were
cored with an increment borer at 30 cm because it is an appropriate
height for simultaneously dating tree age and measuring radial growth.
After analysis of the preliminary plot data, we found that tree ages and
growth rates were highly consistent, so we reduced the labor-intensive
coring rate in order to conserve resources to measure more plots. In
2016 we cored the ﬁrst 20 live trees of each species with a DBH ≥7 cm.
Sampling was reduced to the ﬁrst 20 live trees of each species due to
time constraints. Seedlings or sprouts of tree species shorter than breast
height 1.37 m were tallied on with nested 100 m2 subplots by species
and condition in three height classes: (1) ≤38 cm; (2) 38–80 cm; and
(3) 80–134 cm. Downed woody biomass and forest ﬂoor depth were
measured in a randomly selected direction from the center of the cir-
cular plots along a 15.2 m planar transect (Brown 1974) in each plot.
2.4. Laboratory methods
2.4.1. Dendrochronology
Tree cores were air dried, glued to slotted wooden mounts, and
sanded until wood cells and ring boundaries were clearly visible under
magniﬁcation(Stokes and Smiley, 1968). Cores were visually crossdated
with the chronology NM 573 developed by Margot Kaye et al., in 1997
and a local unpublished chronology that we developed. For cores that
missed the pith, additional years to the center were estimated with a
pith locator consisting of concentric circles matched to the curvature
and density of the inner rings to the estimated pith (Applequist, 1958).
Ring widths of all samples were measured using a Velmex stage and the
Measure J2X software, and quality control of crossdating was done with
the COFECHA program (Grissino-Mayer, 2001). Ring width measure-
ments were converted to diameter growth increment for the simulation
modeling.
2.4.2. Climate-Forest Vegetation Simulator (Climate-FVS, C-FVS)
To model future conditions of teepee pole producing stands we used
the Climate-Forest Vegetation Simulator (Crookston et al., 2010). Cli-
mate-FVS is an extension to the base Forest Vegetation Model Simulator
(FVS), which is a deterministic, individual-tree growth model (Dixon,
2013). FVS is a semi-distant-independent growth model, meaning that
T.K. Mockta et al.

252

tree growth and mortality rates are adjusted based on stand density.
We initialized C-FVS with data from the 30 ﬁeld plots, using the
Mixed Conifer model in the Central Rockies Variant of FVS. Site Index
(SI) values were applied from the nearest continuous forest inventory
(CFI) plots. Plot-speciﬁc growth data from increment cores were used to
adjust simulated tree growth based on observed growth in the period
2000–2016.
The eﬀects of changing climate are simulated in C-FVS through
species viability scores (Crookston et al., 2010) which are based on
bioclimatic relationships of species’ known environmental envelopes
compared to climate scenario conditions (Rehfeldt, 2006). Species
viability scores are used in C-FVS to modify species-speciﬁc tree-growth
rates, site-index, and mortality rates of the base FVS model as a function
of climate scenario selection. The species viability scores are standar-
dized from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates that a species is within its observed
climatic envelope. As conditions increasingly depart from those suitable
for the species, the species viability scores declines. When species via-
bility scores fall below the (arbitrary) level of 0.4, set in C-FVS, the
species can no longer regenerate at the site. Meanwhile, as other species
encounter increasingly favorable conditions, their species viability
scores increase and they can begin to establish on the site through the
Autoestablishment feature of C-FVS (Crookston et al., 2010). A max-
imum of four species were selected from the available species based on
viability score. As a result, most of the trees to be established were those
with increasing species viability scores, inserted by Climate-FVS as best
suited for the future climate of the site based on local availability, cli-
mate scenario, latitude, longitude and elevation.
We used Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios
developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC,
2014) to represent a range of potential future climates. The four RCP
scenarios represent conditions in which radiative forcings increase by
2.6, 4.5, 6.0, or 8.5 Watts per square meter (W/m2) by the year 2100
(van Vuuren et al., 2011) Three of the four RCP scenarios are included
in the current version of Climate-FVS, excluding the RCP 2.6 scenario
which is considered to be unrealistically low in impact. We uploaded
plot coordinates to the C-FVS website and received downscaled pro-
jections for climate variables and SVS values in historical (1990) times
and the dates 2030, 2060, and 2090 for the three available RCP sce-
narios. We also used a “no climate change scenario” consisting of the
standard FVS model without the climate module. We carried out forest
simulations for 100 years after plot establishment. We planned to test
alternative management strategies such as eﬀects of tree thinning or
ﬁre use. However, early results showed that the SVS values for Douglas-
ﬁr at the plot locations rapidly dropped below the level of sustaining or
regenerating the species even under the mildest climate scenario, RCP
4.5. Therefore we revised the modeling component to assess the ele-
vational thresholds at which Douglas-ﬁr could still persist by the end of
the century. We did this by adding hypothetical elevation gains of
305 m and 610 m to the plot elevations and assessing the Douglas-ﬁr
species viability scores under these altered conditions.
3. Results
3.1. Teepee pole stand characteristics
Teepee pole producing stands were found over a range of elevations
from the lowest plot at 2062 m to the highest plot at 2572 m. The
average elevation for all 30 plots was 2405 m (see Supplementary
Information, Table S1). Slopes ranged from 4% to 43%, averaging 18%.
Twenty-ﬁve out of 30 plots (83%) had northerly (WNW to ENE) aspects
while only 5 plots (17%) had southerly aspects in the ESE to SSW range
(Table S1).
A total of nine species were encountered but forest structure was
dominated by Douglas-ﬁr, which comprised 70% of all trees (Table 1).
Douglas-ﬁr averaged 1256 trees per ha (TPH), out of an overall average
of 2059 TPH. One-seed juniper and southwestern white pine were the
second- and third-most common species, but they were far behind
Douglas-ﬁr in density and basal area. Douglas ﬁr accounted for 74%
(31.7 m2/ha) of the total basal area of 42.8 m2/ha. The second-highest
species in basal area, white ﬁr, only averaged 8% (3.5 m2/ha) of the
total. Quadratic mean diameters (QMD) were below 25.4 cm for all
species. Douglas-ﬁr had a QMD of 18.6 cm.
We found 109 cut teepee pole stumps (90 TPH) on the 30 plots. The
average diameter of cut teepee poles measured at stump height was
12.2 cm. Separating out the Douglas-ﬁr trees potentially capable of
being used as teepee poles based on DBH from 7.7 to 17.8 cm for
smaller teepees and 17.9–27.9 cm for a “big teepee,” we found a total of
1,041 potential teepee poles, corresponding to an average density of
858 TPH. Removing individuals with defects, deformities, damage,
pests or illnesses, the total number of usable smaller teepee poles was
518 and 358 larger poles. The total number of usable poles was reduced
to 876 poles (721 TPH), a reduction of approximately 16% in usable
poles. Note that these estimates apply to teepee pole densities within
isolated teepee pole stands, not across the forest in general. The esti-
mates are based on the characteristics of teepee poles as described by
medicine men, but in actual practice the medicine men select the poles
themselves. We found 12 of the 30 teepee pole plots were infested with
dwarf mistletoe. Infected Douglas-ﬁr on average had a mistletoe rating
of 2.6 out of 6, while ponderosa pine had an average rating of 3.7 our of
6.
The average diameter distribution was strongly reverse-J shaped
(Fig. 2), dominated by the smallest size classes of trees. Douglas-ﬁr was
the predominant species in all size classes except the largest diameter
class 56 cm. In contrast to the uneven distribution of tree sizes, the tree
age distribution showed that most of the trees established in the early
20th century primarily in the decades of the 1920s and 1930s (Fig. 3).
The oldest tree encountered was a ponderosa pine with a center date of
1874 (144 years old). The youngest trees established in the 1960s, but
note that the minimum size for sampling was 7 cm so smaller and
younger trees were also present on some plots.
Tree diameter of Douglas-ﬁr was linearly but weakly related to age
with very high variability in the range of 70–100 years old, the ages of
most of the trees (Fig. 4). Diameter growth in the period 2000–2016,
the time period used to calibrate the C-FVS growth model, tended to be
higher in larger Douglas-ﬁr trees but high variability was also present
(Fig. 5). Growth was slow: a 15.2 cm Douglas-ﬁr tree in the size range
for use as a teepee pole grew an average of only 1.1 cm over the past
16 years.
Forest fuels of study plots were relatively low (Fig. 6), averaging
31.6 Mg/ha. Distributed by moisture timelag and soundness categories,
the highest individual category was the 1000-hr rotten woody biomass,
averaging 5.8 Mg/ha. Forest ﬂoor depth averaged 1.1 cm for litter and
3.1 cm for duﬀ, for an overall forest ﬂoor depth averaging 4.2 cm (see
Fig. 7.).

3.2. Forest simulation modeling
Simulated future forests at the current plot locations did not contain
Douglas-ﬁr after a century of modeling, even under the mildest climate
scenario, RCP 4.5. Ninety-seven percent of plots failed to maintain a
minimum basal area of 1.1 m2/ha of any forest species. Complete forest
mortality was predicted under RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5. Comparing bio-
climatic niche modeling of Douglas-ﬁr with downscaled future climate
scenarios indicated that the species would have to be planted at least
305 m higher to maintain 21st century viability under RCP 4.5 and 6.0,
or at least 610 m higher under RCP 8.0 (Fig. 6). (see Fig. 8.).
4. Discussion
4.1. Teepee pole producing stand characteristics
Teepee pole producing stands are scattered throughout the forested
areas of Mescalero. When searching for teepee pole stands, the
Mescalero Apache can identify them visually as dense patches of tall
and “skinny” Douglas-ﬁr trees. In terms of quantitative characteristics
of teepee pole producing stands, stands had on average 1,240 TPH with
the occasional presence of white ﬁr, southwestern white pine, pon-
derosa pine, Gambel oak, and junipers. These stands averaged 32 m2/ha
BA with average diameters ranging from 17.8 to 25.4 cm.
Despite being relatively small, teepee pole stands were not young.
The average tree age was approximately 80 years old. Teepee pole
growth rates averaged less than 0.07 cm/year, nearly an order of
magnitude less than average growth rates for Douglas-ﬁr across the
general Mescalero forest of 0.3–0.6 cm/year (Blanford, 2014).
The potential for severe wildﬁre is a key motivation for thinning
treatments at Mescalero, so the fuel loading is an important issue.
Forest ﬂoor fuel loading averaging 31.6 Mg/ha falls within the optimal
range suggested for management of coarse woody debris balancing ﬁre
risks with ecosystem beneﬁts (Brown et al., 2003). However, the high
density of trees in teepee pole stands and the potential for ladder fuels
associated with the reverse-J diameter distribution does suggest that
ﬁre could reach the canopy relatively easily under severe ﬁre weather
conditions (Honig and Fule, 2012). Since the teepee pole stands are
isolated points in a matrix of thinned, managed forest they likely do not
contribute substantially to landscape-level fuel hazard.
4.2. How will climate change aﬀect teepee pole producing stands?
Climate-Forest Vegetation Simulator runs showed near-complete
tree mortality of Douglas-ﬁr in teepee pole stands by the year 2116.
Some stands maintained low forest basal area but with a shift in species
composition to junipers, Gambel oak, and southwestern white pine as
early as 2065. These results are broadly consistent with the ﬁndings of
other studies using C-FVS primarily in ponderosa pine stands in
northern Arizona (Bagdon and Huang, 2014) and eastern Arizona
(Azpeleta et al., 2014), including the White Mountain Apache Tribal
lands (Shive et al., 2014). These studies found that climate simulations
regardless of treatment led to large decreases in forest basal area by the
mid-century. Fewer studies have been done in mixed conifer forests
with a substantial Douglas-ﬁr component, but these simulations have
also shown forest decline and compositional shift (Stoddard et al.,

2015; Yazzie et al., 2018). Landscape-level simulations in the South-
west U.S. using the Landis-II and/or Fire-BGC models have had more
varied results but broadly coincide with our ﬁndings in terms of basal
area reduction and compositional shift (Flatley and Fulé, 2016; Hurteau
et al., 2016; Loehman et al., 2018).
Additional evidence from other lines of research supports the pro-
jection of substantial loss of southwestern tree species in the 21st
century,
including
dieback
and
mortality
in
Populus
tremuloides
(Michaelian et al., 2011; Rehfeldt et al., 2009), Pinus ponderosa (Gitlin
et al., 2006), and Pinus edulis (Breshears et al., 2005; Shaw et al., 2005),
and for an additional 88 tree species worldwide (Allen et al., 2010).
Independent tracks of research in tree physiological responses to drying
conditions (McDowell et al., 2016) and plant community traits related
to climate (Laughlin et al., 2012) are also consistent in forecasting high
mortality as climate warms.
Climate change scenarios are continually under revision as new
information is gained by climate scientists and as greenhouse gas
emissions by human societies ﬂuctuate (IPCC, 2014). Any particular
model, such as C-FVS, has many limitations and speciﬁc predictions
about forests 50–100 years in the future should be treated with caution.
However, the fact that numerous independent lines of research are
broadly consistent in predicting substantial forest decline should be
taken into consideration by the Mescalero Apache community and re-
source managers.
4.3. Traditional ecological knowledge and forest management
Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) is a knowledge-practice-
belief complex that is not static but continuously evolving through
adaptive processes (Berkes et al., 2000). TEK is accumulated over
generations by observations and lived experiences and oﬀer a holistic
outlook in that all living beings, including humans, are connected with
their environment and these connections are reciprocal (Pierrotti and
Wildcat, 2000). These observations allowed Native Americans and In-
digenous people worldwide to adapt land management techniques and
use tools such as ﬁre on the landscape for millennia (Pyne, 1982). In
some regions of North America, Native people ignited low intensity
ﬁres regularly which helped sustain key natural resources for the people
(Anderson, 2006; Charnley et al., 2007; Pyne, 1982; Stewart, 2002).
The low intensity burns also promoted understory biodiversity as well
as increased resilience to trees to droughts and ﬁres (Long et al., 2017;
Raish et al., 2005). In the southwestern mountains, a semi-arid region
with high lightning density, it is not clear what mix of human- and
lightning-ignited ﬁres occurred in the past (Allen, 1999; Kaye and
Swetnam, 1999). However, there is abundant evidence of ecological as
well as cultural adaptation to the frequent-ﬁre environment (Seklecki
et al., 1996; Fulé,et al., 2011).
Teepee pole conservation in the value systems of the Mescalero
Apache presents certain unique features. First, modern conservation
eﬀorts often focus on large trees because they provide numerous eco-
system services and can take centuries to regrow and are vital to forest
ecosystem resilience (Franklin et al., 2008). However, small (albeit
relatively old) Douglas-ﬁr trees are a critical resource for the Mescalero
Apache Tribe due to the use of teepee poles for ceremonial and spiritual
use. Small diameter teepee poles may have equal or higher value as
large diameter trees in the eyes of the Mescalero Apache, ﬁtting the
deﬁnition in culturally important species, which is “the species that
signiﬁcantly shape the cultural identity of a people, as reﬂected in diet,
materials, medicine, and/or spiritual practice” (Duraiappah et al.,
2005; Emery et al., 2014; Hummel and Lake 2015; Costanza et al.
2017). TEK and shared systems of culture and belief have shown to
facilitate collective responses to environmental disturbances and pro-
mote long-term resilience (Gómez-Baggethun et al., 2012). Loss of TEK
may mean reduced adaptation options for the future (Gómez-Baggethun
et al., 2012).
The use of teepees by the Mescalero has greatly shaped their culture.
Additional resources used in the ceremony include reeds, cattails,
mescal, and Gambel oak. Changing climates, forest management, and
disturbances will aﬀect these other culturally important species as well
(Patel-Weynand et al., 2018). The tribe understands the importance of
sustaining Douglas-ﬁr and other species into the future, which initiated
this study. However, more studies are needed to understand climate
impacts on cultural important species and to develop unique adaptation
strategies for guiding the sustainability of tribally important species for
many generations (Voggesser et al., 2013). Despite the high historical
frequency of ﬁre on the Mescalero landscape (A. Azpeleta et al., un-
published manuscript), the dense teepee pole stands likely require some
level of ﬁre protection. Integrating TEK related to teepee poles into
contemporary management is complex and would require collaboration
and cultural consensus in developing silvicultural and ﬁre management
prescriptions.
5. Management implications and conclusions
Teepee pole producing Douglas-ﬁr stands are an important cultural
resource for the Mescalero Apache Tribe. Management and sustain-
ability are of high priority for these stands and tribal members, fores-
ters, and traditional leaders have come together to explore options on
how to preserve and maintain this resource. From informal conversa-
tions and attending ceremonies and, we gained insights on the current
issues surrounding teepee pole stands. Using these issues to guide our
research we have come to learn that teepee pole stands are quite dense
compared to the surrounding forested areas of Mescalero, contain re-
latively low understory regeneration, and moderate levels of fuel
loading.
What are the options for sustaining traditional use of Douglas-ﬁr
teepee poles? Current management of teepee pole producing stands
include locating and marking currently known sites, and excluding
these stands from silvicultural treatment. These practices should be
continued. We are working with the Tribe to identify additional teepee
pole stands using remote sensing (A. Sánchez Meador and others, un-
published data). Across the Mescalero landscape there are some addi-
tional areas of dense Douglas-ﬁr regeneration with seedlings that are
currently too small for teepees but which could develop teepee pole
characteristics in the future; these areas should also be marked and be
excluded from treatment as well. Exclusion from treatment and survival
of regeneration will increase the amount of possible usable poles in the
future. In addition, the Mescalero Apache Tribe has an agreement with
the Lincoln National Forest under which tribal members can cut teepee
poles on National Forest Land.
Reuse of poles, rather than collection of new poles for ceremonies,
may be culturally acceptable strategy for extending pole availability
based on our conversations with medicine men. This option can be
explored further as TEK is evolving adaptive processes within the ap-
propriate cultural context. Proper storage of collected teepee poles
above ground, in a well-ventilated area can reduce the chances of
warping, insect infestation, and growth of mold, prolonging the use of
these poles.
There is much uncertainty involving the future eﬀects of climate
change on forests in the Southwest but the Climate-FVS simulations we
tested under RCP 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 suggested high to complete mortality
of Douglas-ﬁr at the elevations of the current teepee pole plots on
Mescalero Apache Tribal Lands. In order to sustain teepee pole stands in
the future, the simulation runs indicated that Douglas-ﬁr would have to
grow 305 m to 610 m higher than currently. This suggests that if the
Mescalero Apache Tribe would want to sustain teepee pole producing
stands 100 years into the future, planting of Douglas-ﬁr could be
helpful. A possible strategy to consider is planting Douglas-ﬁr saplings
at high densities on shaded aspects of Sierra Blanca. The portion of
Sierra Blanca within the tribal boundary is largely southerly in aspect,
but it might be useful to search for favorable microsites with non-
southerly aspect and perhaps locally moist conditions. Experimental

planting with diﬀerent varieties of Douglas-ﬁr from across tribal lands
or perhaps elsewhere in the Southwest might be helpful to assess
drought tolerance. Given that the trees currently used for teepee poles
are 70–90 years old, staggered plantings on a decadal basis in 305 m
increments might be suﬃcient to sustain ceremonial needs. We also
recommend that there should be a prioritization of harvest where
stands are closer to reaching mortality than others. This will allow
better utilization of teepee pole producing stands thought MATL. As
described above, climate predictions and modeling of future climate
eﬀects have considerable uncertainty. These models are meant for
forest managers to gain some insight into possible future forest condi-
tions, rather than as an exact guide to future conditions. Following the
management suggestions above will help ensure that this important
ceremony can carry on.
