Abstract.
The rationale for seeding following high-severity wildfires is to enhance plant cover and reduce bare ground,
thus decreasing the potential for soil erosion and non-native plant invasion. However, experimental tests of the
effectiveness of seeding in meeting these objectives in forests are lacking. We conducted three experimental studies of
the effectiveness of seeding with non-native and native species following three Arizona wildfires. Seeding treatments were
largely ineffective in increasing vegetative cover or decreasing exposed bare ground. At one treatment at one fire, wheat
seeding at the Warm Fire, senesced seeded annuals increased litter cover and resulted in lower bare ground values than
unseeded controls. Only on one fire, the Warm Fire, did seeded non-native annuals establish well, resulting in 20–29%
vegetative cover. On the other two fires, seeded cereal grains accounted for o3% cover. At all fires, native seeded species
contributed between o1 and ,12% vegetative cover. Vegetative cover on all treatments, including unseeded treatments,
was at or near 40% the first year following fire, at all three study sites. Non-native species richness and abundance did not
differ among treatments at any fire. This study adds to growing evidence that post-fire seeding is ineffective in enhancing
post-fire plant cover and reducing invasive non-native plants.

Introduction
High-severity wildfires in forested ecosystems consume high
percentages of aboveground biomass, vegetative cover, litter and
duff (Ryan and Noste 1985). The increase in bare mineral soil,
light and nutrient availability following high-severity wildfires
may increase water runoff and soil erosion, and facilitate non-
native plant invasions (Benavides-Solorio and MacDonald 2001;
Crawford et al. 2001; Johansen et al. 2001). In an attempt to
ameliorate the effects of high-severity wildfires, resource man-
agers frequently apply post-wildfire treatments, such as contour
felling of logs, mulching and seeding. Owing to its low cost, ease
of application, and long history of use, seeding is the most widely
applied post-wildfire treatment (Beyers 2004). Species used in
post-wildfire seeding are most commonly quick-growing non-
native grasses (Robichaud et al. 2000). Quick growth is impor-
tant because the risk of increased runoff and erosion is highest
in the first year after fire (Robichaud et al. 2006; Wagenbrenner
et al. 2006). Seeded species most commonly utilised include
non-native cereal grains, which are either sterile hybrids or
annuals with low reproductive potential in forested ecosystems
(Robichaud et al. 2000). Seeding with longer-lived native per-
ennial species has been recommended to produce more persistent
vegetative cover and standing crop compared with seeding with
annuals (Richards et al. 1998; Beschta et al. 2004). However, use
of native seeded species in post-wildfire rehabilitation has been
limited and there is relatively little published information on the
effectiveness of native species in meeting post-fire vegetative
cover objectives (Beschta et al. 2004).
Post-wildfire seeding is predicated on the assumption that
seeding will enhance plant cover and reduce bare ground, thereby
reducing runoff and erosion rates (Robichaud et al. 2000; Beyers
2004). Conceptually, the relationship between cover and reduced
erosion is two-fold. First, plant cover prevents rainsplash and
sheet erosion by intercepting precipitation before it strikes the
soil surface (DeBano et al. 1998). Second, plant roots increase
soil water infiltration and can aid in the deterioration of hydro-
phobic soil layers that may result from high-severity wildfires
(Benavides-Solorio and MacDonald 2001).
The proportion of exposed bare ground and ground covered
are important predictors of post-fire runoff and erosion rates.
Several studies from forested ecosystems have demonstrated
significant positive correlations between the percentage of
exposed bare ground and both water runoff and soil erosion
(Benavides-Solorio and MacDonald 2001; Johansen et al.
2001). These studies have shown consistent significant
increases in soil loss as exposed soil reaches 460–70% on
severely burned areas (Johansen et al. 2001). Other research
has shown a negative correlation between ground cover

compared with post-fire water runoff and soil erosion (Johansen
et al. 2001; Wagenbrenner et al. 2006). Post-fire erosion studies
from coniferous forests support the concept that high vegetative
cover results inlow amountsofrunoffand erosion rates (Johansen
et al. 2001; Wagenbrenner et al. 2006). Recent studies from
coniferous forests including ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa
C. Lawson) and grand fir (Abies grandis Douglas exD. Don)have
demonstrated that a minimum of 50–70% cover is most closely
associated with low amounts of runoff and erosion (Johansen
et al. 2001; Robichaud et al. 2006; Wagenbrenner et al. 2006).
Researchers and land managers commonly use 60% cover as a
target value in evaluating the effectiveness of seeding treatments
(Robichaud et al. 2000; Beyers 2004; Keeley 2004; USDA Forest
Service 2004).
Preventing or reducing the abundance of invasive non-native
species after fire is often a goal of seeding (Robichaud et al. 2000;
Beyers 2004). The assumption is that seeded species will grow
quickly and utilise available resources, thus co-opting them from
invading non-natives. Previous research suggests the degree to
which non-native abundance is reduced depends on the resulting
dominanceofthe seededspecies inthe post-fire plant community.
Studies from wildfires and prescribed burns have shown seeding,
whether with native or non-native species, had little effect on
non-native species abundance owing to low dominance of seeded
species (Kruse et al. 2004; Springer and Laughlin 2004; Daniels
et al. 2008; Kuenzi et al. 2008). In contrast, two studies demon-
strated short-term reductions in non-native species following
post-wildfire seeding with either wheat (Keeley 2004) or native
seed mixes (Thompson et al. 2006); in both cases, seeded species
had high dominance in the post-fire plant community.
Experimental tests of the effectiveness of post-wildfire seed-
ing of native and non-native species in enhancing plant cover and
standing crop, reducing bare ground, and curtailing invasive non-
native plants are rare. Thompson et al. (2006), who experimented
with native and non-native seeding in a sagebrush (Artemisia
spp.) steppe plant community, is a notable exception, but we
were unable to find similar studies from coniferous forests.
Most studies have been opportunistic and observational, in that
researchers have established study areas within large landscape-
level seeding treatments implemented by managers following
fire. This has led to difficulty in locating unseeded control areas
for comparisons as well as uncertainty over the amount of seed
applied at the plot level of observation (Schoennagel and Waller
1999; Barclay et al. 2004; Kruse et al. 2004). The result of these
difficulties can be small sample sizes and weak inferences.
We took advantage of three separate, high-severity wildfires
that occurred in ponderosa pine forests. We used a controlled,
replicated and randomised experimental design to determine the
effects and effectiveness of native and non-native seeding in the
first year following fire. We hypothesised that seeding would:
(1) decrease bare ground; (2) increase plant canopy cover and
standing crop; and (3) reduce non-native species abundance and
richness.
Methods
Study areas
We selected three wildfires in Arizona ponderosa pine forests
(Fig. 1). The Potato and Warm Fires burned in 2006; the Birdie
Fire burned in 2007. We sampled immediately post burn and
1 year after fire, the period within which plant establishment
is required to meet rehabilitation objectives. Replicated, rando-
mised, controlled experimental plots were established in areas
dominated by ponderosa pine, within 4 weeks of fire contain-
ment, on high-severity portions of the burn, as defined by federal
Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) teams. Sever-
ity classification was ground-truthed by visually assessing
tree mortality, crown scorch height, and ground char (Ryan and
Noste 1985).
The fires spanned an elevational gradient (Fig. 1). The Warm
Fire burned from 8 June to 4 July 2006 on the Kaibab National
Forest. This fire had the highest average elevation, 2400 m,
and the greatest average yearly precipitation, 64.5 cm (Western
Regional Climate Center, see www.wrcc.dri.edu, accessed
6 June 2009); soils were predominantly Mollic Eutroboralfs
with a sandy loam texture derived from limestone parent
materials (Brewer et al. 1991). The Potato Fire burned 6–28
June 2006 on the Apache–Sitgreaves National Forest. This fire
had the lowest average elevation, 2050m, and the lowest average
yearly precipitation, 52.4cm (www.wrcc.dri.edu). The dominant
soil types were Lithic and Typic Eutroboralfs; these moderately
deep gravelly soils with a sandy loam texture were derived
from basaltic parent materials (Laing et al. 1991). The Birdie
Fire burned 6–15 July 2007 on the Coconino National Forest.
The average elevation, 2200m, and average annual precipitation,
59cm, are intermediate relative to those at the Warm and Potato
Fires (Miller et al. 1991; www.wrcc.dri.edu). The dominant soil
type was Mollic Eutroboralfs with cobbly loam texture derived
from basaltic parent materials (Miller et al. 1991). Precipitation at
all three sites approximated long-term averages in the year of fire
and the first year following fire (Fig. 2). Fire containment, plot
establishment, and seeding all occurred within 1 to 3 weeks of the
onset of high-intensity summer monsoonal precipitation (Fig. 2;
www.wrcc.dri.edu).
Experimental design and treatments
We established fifteen 20  25-m (500-m2) plots per treatment
at each fire. Plots were located within unseeded areas of high-
severity burn, with slopes between 5 and 25%. The minimum
distance between plots was 100 m, and plots were randomly
located with respect to aspect, soil type, and prefire conifer
abundance. Data were collected immediately and 1 year post
fire. Experimental treatments randomly assigned to plots
were: (1) seeding with non-native common wheat (Triticum
aestivum L.); (2) seeding with non-native annual ryegrass
(Lolium multiflorum Lam.); (3) seeding with a native seed mix
including: squirreltail (Elymus elymoides (Raf.) Swezey), blue
grama (Bouteloua gracilis (Willd. ex Kunth) Lag. ex Griffiths),
muttongrass (Poa fendleriana (Steud.) Vasey), scarlet gilia
(Ipomopsis aggregata (Pursh) V.E. Grant), and purple locoweed
(Oxytropis lambertii Pursh.); plus (4) unseeded control. Owing
to fire size, treatments varied between fires. At the Potato and
Birdie Fires, treatments 1, 3 and 4 were tested; at the Warm Fire,
all four treatments were tested. Our target seeding rate was
403 pure live seeds (PLS) m2 (Table 1), based on the USDA
Natural Resources Conservation Service (2004) recommended
rate of 269 PLS m2 with an increase of 1.5 to 2 times for
broadcast seeding. These seeding rates are similar to those used

in other post-fire seeding experiments (Robichaud et al. 2000;
Thompson et al. 2006). Seed was hand broadcast at each plot
immediately following plot establishment.
Species used in seed treatments were selected because they
are commonly used by land managers or showed promising
results in studies in this region (Jones 1998; Robichaud et al.
2000; Elseroad et al. 2003; Barclay et al. 2004). Annual ryegrass
was seeded on portions of the Warm Fire and the 1997 Dome
Fire in New Mexico (Barclay et al. 2004). Wheat was seeded
on portions of the Potato Fire and the 2002 Rodeo–Chediski
Fire in Arizona (Kuenzi et al. 2008). We included species with
broad geographic distributions and included both cool-season
(C3: bottlebrush squirreltail, muttongrass, and purple locoweed)
and warm-season (C4: blue grama and scarlet gilia) plants in
an effort to enhance plant cover throughout the growing season
(Dodge 2004; Springer and Laughlin 2004; Moore et al. 2006;
Daniels et al. 2008).
Response variables
We estimated each of the following variables: total live plant
canopy cover, litter, rock, and bare ground cover, plus cover by
life form (graminoids, shrubs, and forbs) and by species in fifty
20  50-cm (0.1-m2) quadrats per plot. We placed the quadrats
at 1-m intervals on the right side of five permanent transects
in each plot. We estimated cover by classes (1 ¼ o1%, 2 ¼
1–5%, 3 ¼ 6–25%, 4 ¼ 26–50%, 5 ¼ 51–75%, 6 ¼ 76–95%,
7 ¼ 96–100%) modified from Daubenmire (1959). We added the
o1% class based on Bailey and Poulton’s (1968) recommenda-
tion to better describe vegetation occurring in very small amounts.
We used midpoints of each cover class to calculate averages.
Plant standing crop was sampled in each plot by clipping
herbaceous vegetation in fifteen 0.25-m2 circular quadrats, three
per transect, randomly placed along the left side of each transect.
Clipped material was separated by species in the field, placed
in paper bags, oven-dried for 48 h at 708C, and weighed to the
nearest 0.01 g (Moore et al. 2006).
We sampled between the end of July and the end of August
to capture plant cover and biomass present at the onset of
high intensity monsoonal rainstorms (www.wrcc.dri.edu). These
rainstorms account for approximately half of yearly precipita-
tion in this region (www.wrcc.dri.edu). Plant nomenclature and
nativity are according to the Plants Database (http://plants.usda.
gov, accessed 6 March 2009). Plant reference specimens are
stored at the Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona
University, Flagstaff, Arizona.

Statistical analysis
Owing to differences in site characteristics, dates of burn,
and variations in treatments applied, we analysed each fire as
a separate experiment. We tested assumptions of normal
distribution of data using the Shapiro–Wilk test and homo-
geneous variances using the Levene test in JMP ver. 7.0.1 (SAS
Institute Inc. 2009). Owing to non-normality and heterogeneous
variances in many of our response variables, we used non-
parametric testing procedures (Anderson 2001).
We used PERMANOVA analysis in PC-ORD ver. 5.1 with
Bray–Curtis distance measures for all analyses, although similar
results were observed using Euclidean distances (Faith et al.
1987; Ludwig and Reynolds 1988; McCune and Mefford 1999).

variance procedure that can be used with univariate or multi-
variate datasets. We used 9999 permutations per test (Anderson
2001). When significant differences were detected among
treatments, we used a non-parametric pair-wise a posteriori
t-test to separate means (Anderson 2001). For all tests, we used
a ¼ 0.05 to determine significance.
We tested for differences among treatments immediately
post fire and 1 year following fire. Immediately post fire, but
before seeding treatments were applied, we tested for differ-
ences in substrate, litter, and plant cover among treatments. At
1 year following fire, we tested for differences among treatments
in total plant cover, standing crop and cover of non-native
species (excluding seeded non-natives), litter and bare ground.
We also analysed cover and standing crop by life-form (grami-
noids, forbs, shrubs) by treatments.
Results
Does seeding decrease bare ground?
Immediately post-fire, before treatments were applied, bare ground
ranged from 42 to 48% at the Warm Fire, 65 to 68% at the Potato
Fire, and 55 to 60% at the Birdie Fire (all standard errors (s.e.)
o5.2%). There were no significant differences in bare ground
among treatments at the Potato, Birdie or Warm Fires (P¼ 0.86,
0.89, 0.76 respectively). Immediately post fire, litter cover ranged
from 19 to 39% across all treatments at all three fires; rock cover
rangedfrom5to13% andlogcoveraveragedo1%.Therewereno
significant differences in litter, rock or log cover among treatments
at the Potato, Birdie or Warm Fires (litter: P¼ 0.69, 0.99, 0.69;
rock: 0.95, 0.99, 0.50; log: 0.96, 0.76, 0.95 respectively). Residual
post-fire vegetative cover averaged between o0.5 and 5.0%, with
no significant difference among treatments at any fire.
In the first year after seeding, bare ground did not differ
among treatments at the Potato (P ¼ 0.99) or Birdie Fires
(P ¼ 0.77) (Fig. 3a). Bare ground differed among treatments
only at the Warm Fire, with significantly (P ¼ 0.03) lower levels
on plots seeded with wheat than unseeded treatments (Fig. 3a).
This difference was explained by higher levels of litter at the
Warm Fire wheat treatments compared with the unseeded
treatments (P ¼ 0.02), 52% cover of litter at the wheat treat-
ments compared with 36% on unseeded treatments, with native
treatments and ryegrass treatments having intermediate amounts
(42 and 47% respectively). Litter cover did not differ among
treatments at the Potato, where litter cover ranged from 25 to
27% (P ¼ 0.91) or Birdie Fires, where litter cover ranged from
59 to 61% (P ¼ 0.88).
Does seeding increase ground cover, plant cover,
and standing crop?
Warm Fire
Total canopy cover was significantly higher on ryegrass
seeded plots (P o 0.01) and native seeded plots (P ¼ 0.04)
compared with unseeded plots (Fig. 3b). The total canopy cover
was ,13% higher on the ryegrass treatments and ,10% higher
on native seeded treatments compared with unseeded controls.
Wheat treatments produced an intermediate amount of cover
,9% greater than unseeded controls, which did not differ
significantly from unseeded controls. However, total plant stand-
ing crop did not differ among treatments (P ¼ 0.28) (Fig. 4a).
Seeding altered the abundance of graminoids. Graminoid
cover and standing crop differed significantly (P ¼ 0.02 and
o0.01) among treatments, with higher graminoid cover and
standing crop on seeded plots compared with unseeded controls.
Annual ryegrass and wheat were major species in terms of
canopy cover on their respective treatments (Table 2a). On the
native seed treatment, two seeded grasses, squirreltail and mut-
tongrass, dominated plant cover and standing crop. Major species
on unseeded plots included squirreltail, muttongrass, a native
Carex, and a variety of native forbs. Graminoid standing crop
on unseeded controls was the lowest at 54.4 kg ha1 (s.e. 12.5)
compared with the native seeded treatment at 114.2 kg ha1 (s.e.
21.2), the ryegrass at 163kg ha1 (s.e. 36.1), and the wheat
treatment had the highest at 368.8 kg ha1 (s.e. 97.2). Total forb
cover, standing crop and shrub cover did not differ significantly
among treatments (P ¼ 0.51, 0.29 and 0.12) (Fig. 4a).
Potato Fire
Total plant canopy cover (P ¼ 0.43) and plant standing
crop (P ¼ 0.33) did not differ significantly among treatments
in the first year following fire (Figs 3b, 4b). Similarly, we did
not detect significant differences in canopy cover (P ¼ 0.33)
or standing crop (P ¼ 0.48) of graminoids among treatments
(Fig. 4b). Nor was there a significant difference in total forb
cover (P ¼ 0.51) or standing crop (P ¼ 0.36) among treatments.
There were only trace amounts of shrub species.

In contrast to the Warm Fire, species included in the seed
mixes were not always the major species in terms of plant
canopy cover. Wheat cover at the Potato Fire averaged o2% on
the wheat seed treatment, and on the native seed treatment,
only two seeded species, blue grama and squirreltail, had cover
42% (Table 2b). Instead, native forbs originating from natural
regeneration and recruitment dominated plant canopy cover on
all treatments the first year following burning.
Birdie Fire
Total vegetative cover (P ¼ 0.31) and standing crop
(P ¼ 0.74) did not differ among treatments in the first year
following fire (Figs 3b, 4c). However, graminoid cover and
standing crop differed among treatments (P ¼ 0.03 and 0.01),
with higher levels on native seeded treatments compared with
both unseeded and wheat treatments. Graminoid standing crop
on unseeded controls was 105.9 kg ha1 (s.e. 22.9) compared
with 173.2 kg ha1 (s.e. 20.3) on the native seeded treatment,
and 75.8 kg ha1 (s.e. 21.3) on the wheat treatment (Fig. 4c).
The Birdie Fire was similar to the Potato Fire in that wheat
had very low cover in the first year following fire (,2%)
(Table 2c). On the native seeding treatment, two seeded species,
blue grama and squirreltail, were major species. On unseeded
plots, native forbs and graminoids constituted the majority of the
post-fire plant cover. Shrub cover ranged from 1.5 (s.e. 0.5) to
4.6% (s.e. 1.8) on the three treatments.
Does seeding reduce non-native species?
Plant standing crop of non-native species (excluding seeded
species) was highly variable and did not differ among treatments
at any fire (Potato fire: P ¼ 0.17, Birdie Fire: P ¼ 0.82; we
detected only trace amounts of non-natives at the Warm Fire).
Non-native species richness (other than the seeded species)
ranged from 4 to 11 species on the three fires and did not differ
among treatments on any fire (P40.77).
In the first year post burn at the Warm Fire, we found five
non-native species: cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.), bull thistle
(Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten.), redstem stork’s bill (Erodium

Scop.). Richness of non-natives among treatments was similar,
with the exception of yellow salsify, which was not present on the
native seeded treatments.
Non-native species at the Potato Fire in the first year
following fire were bull thistle, redstem stork’s bill, little hog-
weed (Portulaca oleracea L.) and common mullein (Verbascum
thapsus L.). Little hogweed was prevalent on all plots but owing
to its diminutive stature, accounted for little standing crop. Bull

made up trace (o2% of total non-native standing crop)
amounts, except mullein, which was responsible for the majority
of the non-native standing crop. Distribution and abundance of
mullein varied among treatments but not significantly owing to
the large variation. Mullein occurred on one-third of the total

total standing crop (mullein standing crop: unseeded plots
(12.7 kg ha1, s.e. 8.5), native (40.6 kg ha1, s.e. 30.8), and
wheat plots (102 kg ha1, s.e. 68).
Eleven non-native species were present at the Birdie Fire
(cheatgrass, bull thistle, prickly lettuce, prostrate knotweed
(Polygonum aviculare L.), little hogweed, Canada bluegrass
(Poa compressa L.), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.),
Dalmatian toadflax (Linaria dalmatica L. Mill.), common
dandelion, yellow salsify, and common mullein). Two species
occurred only on native seeded plots (yellow salsify and Canada
bluegrass). The two most abundant non-natives were Kentucky
bluegrass and common mullein; together, they accounted for
over 90% of non-native standing crop at all treatments. Similar
to the Potato Fire, the distribution of these species varied greatly,
occurring on less than one-third of the plots. When these species
occurred, they accounted for between 21 and 40% (between
70.6 kg ha1, s.e. 31.1 and 152.2 kg ha1, s.e. 113.64) of total
standing crop.
Discussion
Does seeding decrease bare ground?
Immediately post fire, the percentage of bare ground on two
fires was above 55%, thus potentially putting these sites at risk
for increased sediment loss. On the Warm Fire, bare ground
was lower, but still within the range considered to be at risk for
increased sediment yields following intense storms (Robichaud
et al. 2000; Wagenbrenner et al. 2006). A year later, bare ground
on all treatments at the Potato Fire changed little and remained at
levels potentially at risk for increased erosion. The percentage of
bare ground at the Birdie Fire, regardless of treatment, declined to
levels low enough to curtail erosion (Johansen et al. 2001). At the
Warm Fire, wheat seeding significantly decreased bare ground
compared with all other treatments, largely owing to increased
litter cover from the senesced wheat. Levels of bare ground at the
Warm Fire on all treatments, including unseeded controls, were
low enough to protect sites from all but the most intense storms
(Johansen et al. 2001; Pannkuk and Robichaud 2003; Groen and
Woods 2008). Thus, with the exception of wheat seeding on one
fire, seeding treatments were largely ineffective in decreasing
bare ground. At two fires, litter accumulations and plant regen-
eration on all treatments, including unseeded treatments, resulted
in bare ground values well below those associated with increased
runoff and erosion (Johansen et al. 2001).

Minimal effectiveness of post-wildfire seeding
Int. J. Wildland Fire
753

The ineffectiveness of seeding treatments at reducing bare
ground we documented is similar to several previous post-
wildfire studies (Robichaud et al. 2006; Wagenbrenner et al.
2006). In fact, evidence supporting the effectiveness of seeding
in significantly reducing bare ground is limited. Amaranthus
et al. (1993) reported significant reductions in bare ground
following seeding with annual ryegrass, and Keeley (2004)
reported similar results with wheat seeding at high rates. In both
of these studies, and in our one treatment where the proportion of
bare ground was lower, the resulting reductions in bare ground
were attributed to a thatch layer produced by the senesced
seeded annuals.
Does seeding increase plant cover and standing crop?
Our results, along with previous research from both experi-
mental and observational studies, indicate post-wildfire seeding
treatments are largely ineffective in significantly increasing
vegetative cover in forested ecosystems in the first year fol-
lowing fire (Robichaud et al. 2000) (Table 3). Where we did
find differences in cover resulting from seeding, the unseeded
treatments averaged 40% cover, whereas the native treatments
averaged 49%, and the ryegrass averaged 53% cover. However,
whether these differences in vegetative cover will confer sub-
stantial reductions in post-fire runoff and erosion is unclear
(Benavides-Solorio and MacDonald 2001; Johansen et al. 2001).
Using the target cover value of 60%, no treatment achieved
this level of cover in the first year following fire (Robichaud
et al. 2000; Johansen et al. 2001).
Although seeding is predicated on the assumption that
plant regeneration following high-severity fire will be slow
and seeding will increase cover, we found relatively high
amounts of vegetative cover on all unseeded treatments in all
three case studies (Robichaud et al. 2000). Plant species utilising
multiple regeneration and recruitment strategies were present in
the post-fire plant community. These included perennial plants
regenerating from underground persistent root masses, regen-
eration of species that are known to produce persistent seed
banks, and colonising species (Wienk et al. 2004; Korb et al.
2005; http://plants.usda.gov).
Standing crop sampling accounts for differences in plant
architecture that were not captured in vegetative cover values;
for example, annual ryegrass is relatively prostrate (high relative
cover and low standing crop) whereas wheat has a vertical
architecture (low relative cover and high standing crop). At
one fire, increased graminoid standing crop was attributable to
seeded annual species. Seeded annuals complete their lifecycle
in one growing season, senesce, and in following growing
seasons can contribute to increased litter but not to belowground
biomass (Amaranthus et al. 1993; Schoennagel and Waller 1999;
Keeley 2004). In contrast, increased graminoid standing crop
associated with native seeded perennials will likely persist
into subsequent years, contributing to belowground biomass
(Gill et al. 2002). Seeding native perennial species has been
promoted as an alternative to annuals to encourage longer-term
ecosystem rehabilitation (Richards et al. 1998; Beschta et al.
2004). As the risk of soil erosion following fire is the greatest in
the first few growing seasons, a successful treatment would need
to produce high amounts of standing crop quickly following
treatment application (Wagenbrenner et al. 2006). Neither native
nor non-native seeding treatmentsresulted in highertotal standing
crop in the first year.
The minimal effectiveness of seeding in increasing vegeta-
tive cover or standing crop that we found may be linked to timing
and intensity of precipitation (Robichaud et al. 2000). High-
intensity rains can physically remove and transport surface
materials including seeds (Johansen et al. 2001) and have
been linked to low success of seeding in previous research
(Robichaud et al. 2006; Wagenbrenner et al. 2006). In the
mountainous western United States, such high-intensity rain-
storms commonly coincide with or immediately follow mid-
summer fires (Swetnam and Betancourt 1990). At all of our
study sites, the onset of high-intensity summer rainstorms
coincided with fire containment, plot establishment and seeding.
Another factor that may have limited the success of some of
our seeded native species is the origin of the seed. Four of the
five seeded species were from regionally local sources; how-
ever, the squirreltail that comprised almost half of the seed mix
was from a non-local source. There is evidence, both at small
and regional scales, that many species are genetically adapted to
site-specific conditions (Grant 1982; Millar and Libby 1989;
Raabova et al. 2007). The risk of seeding with native species that
are not locally adapted is two-fold. First, the seed may be poorly
adapted to site-specific conditions, and germination and success
of seeding may be reduced (Raabova et al. 2007). Second,
gene flow from introduced plants may swamp local populations,
effectively removing or altering patterns of local adaptation
(Jones 1998; McKay et al. 2005). The degree to which non-
local genetics of native seeded species affected our results is
unknown, but could have lasting consequences.
Does seeding reduce non-native species?
We attributed the ineffectiveness of seeding in altering the
abundance or richness of non-native species in the first year to
two factors. First, non-native abundance was relatively low on
all three fires. Second, even the most successful seeding treat-
ment resulted in inadequate plant cover to exclude non-natives
(Grace 1999; Grime 2001). Species exclusions are generally
associated with high cover or dominance of seeded species in the
plant community (Barclay et al. 2004; Keeley 2004). At our two
fires where non-natives occurred in higher than trace amounts,
seeded wheat established o3% cover and seeded native per-
ennial species provided between 4 and 14% cover. Thus, seeded
species abundance was too low to influence non-native abun-
dance. Thompson et al. (2006) found lower non-native annuals
on plots seeded with native perennials in the third growing
season post burn, indicating the potential longer-term benefits of
seeding with native perennial species.
Seeding to control non-native species following a high-
severity wildfire is often based on the assumption that non-
natives will increase following fire; however, this may not
always be the case. Recent studies show two distinctly different
patterns regarding non-native species invasions following
high-severity fires in ponderosa pine forests. The first pattern
indicates colonising species, including non-natives, increase
following high-severity fire (Crawford et al. 2001; Griffis
et al. 2001; Hunter et al. 2006). In contrast, the second pattern

indicates non-natives do not increase following fire (Huisinga
et al. 2005; Kuenzi et al. 2008). Huisinga et al. (2005) attributed
low non-native species abundance in a National Park to low
propagule pressure due to low levels of anthropogenic influence.
However, our three study sites and those of Kuenzi et al. (2008)
have a long history of active management and resource utilisa-
tion, and both of these studies documented low levels of non-
native species following high-severity wildfires.
Some research has indicated the risk of non-native species
invasion following high-severity disturbances may increase
over time (Keeley 2004). If this is true for semiarid ponderosa
pine forests, seeding with ephemeral non-native cereal grains
or sterile hybrid species would not be effective in reducing
invasions in future growing seasons, as timing of the greatest
abundance of seeded species would not coincide with non-
native species increases. Some researchers have demonstrated
longer-lived perennial species may reduce the abundance of
non-native species in the third growing season and beyond
(Thompson et al. 2006), implying seeding with native peren-
nials may be a more appropriate method of curtailing non-native
species invasions. However, studies examining non-native
species abundances in the second or third year following high-
severity wildfires in ponderosa pine forests do not demonstrate
increases in these plants (Huisinga et al. 2005; Kuenzi et al.
2008).
Although the abundance and richness of non-natives is,
so far, low on our study sites, some non-native species present
are considered ‘transformer’ species and may increase, or
have negative ecological effects, over time (Richardson et al.
2000). Of the 11 non-native species we recorded, six are listed
as noxious in at least one south-western state (University of
Montana
Invaders
Database,
http://invader.dbs.umt.edu/,
accessed January 2010; http://plants.usda.gov): cheatgrass, bull
thistle, redstem stork’s bill, Dalmatian toadflax, little hogweed
and common mullein. Some of these species can significantly
alter ecosystem structure or function in other forested systems
(D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992; Oliff et al. 2001; D’Antonio
et al. 2004). Longer-term monitoring of these sites is warranted
to both assess population trajectories of these non-native species
and to better evaluate the relative effectiveness of seeding
treatments in restoring native plant communities.
Conclusion
The efficacy of post-wildfire seeding to increase vegetative
cover, reduce bare ground, and prevent non-native species
invasion following fire is not well supported by previous
research (Robichaud et al. 2000). When seeding has resulted in
high levels of vegetative cover the first post-fire growing season,
it has been in more mesic conifer ecosystems (Amaranthus
1989) or when seed was applied at high rates (Keeley 2004).
In drier ecosystems, including chaparral and ponderosa pine
forests, seeding has been ineffective in producing high levels
of vegetative cover (Beyers 2004; Wagenbrenner et al. 2006).
Additionally, natural regeneration resulting from increased light
and nutrient availability often yields high levels of vegetative
cover without seeding following fire (Keeley et al. 2003;
Huisinga et al. 2005). Here, we provide evidence for low
vegetative cover and standing crop from seeding in ponderosa
pine forests using a replicated experimental design on three
wildfires with both native and non-native seeding treatments.
Seeding has been shown to have negative effects on plant
communities, which may have long-term negative effects on
plant regeneration. Beyers’ (2004) review noted that in the cases
when seeding provided cover values thought to significantly
reduce erosion, there were negative ecological effects as a result
of the high abundance of seeded species. Some of these negative
effects included reduced abundance of conifer, shrub and annual
colonising species (Schoennagel and Waller 1999; Keeley
2004). This pattern of dominant species reducing abundance
of other species in plant communities is well documented
(Stohlgren et al. 2003; Smith et al. 2004; Spehn et al. 2004),
and in this context is counter to long-term goals of ecosystem
rehabilitation (Keeley 2004). Thus, the paradox of seeding
following fires is that seeded species need to produce high
amounts of cover to effectively reduce bare ground and non-
native species invasions, but high cover and dominance of
seeded species is often associated with negative impacts to plant
community regeneration (Beyers 2004; Keeley 2004).
The high financial cost and low potential for effectiveness
should call into question the continued practice of seeding
areas burned in high-severity wildfires. Robichaud et al.
(2000) estimated that post-wildfire rehabilitation over the last
decade cost US$48 million and Wolfson et al. (2005) reported
US$6 million was spent in Arizona and New Mexico over a
2-year period. Both of these reviews indicate that seeding was
the most widely applied post-wildfire treatment. Our study adds
to the growing evidence that post-fire seeding is often ineffec-
tive in enhancing post-fire plant cover, reducing bare ground, or
reducing invasive non-natives.
