Frequent-ﬁre conifer forests in western North America are undergoing restoration and fuel-reduction
treatments to reduce chance of severe crown ﬁre and re-balance tree and understory plant biomass. A
central decision in these treatments remains where to retain trees within sites during tree thinning. To
help inform thinning prescriptions by identifying patterns of soil development, we sampled and classiﬁed
48 soil pedons among three vegetation patch types (grassy openings, openings invaded by post-settle-
ment trees <age 130 years, and pre-settlement tree patches) at 8 sites in northern Arizona Pinus ponder-
osa forests. We found that 69% of pedons in openings were classiﬁed as Mollisols (a soil order associated
with grasslands), whereas 75% of pedons in pre-settlement tree patches were Alﬁsols (a forest soil order).
Soil differences among patches primarily related to soil morphology and development of epipedons, not
necessarily reﬂected in analyses of properties (e.g., horizon thickness, organic C) of horizons. Turnover in
soil orders occurs on a scale of meters to tens of meters within sites on this landscape, corresponding
with distribution of vegetation patch types. Owing to long time periods required for these soil patterns
to develop, results provide additional support for an idea that locations of tree and herbaceous patches
were stable for long time periods (centuries to millennia). Results suggest that soil development patterns
warrant consideration when choosing spatial locations of ‘leave’ trees during forest thinning.

1. Introduction
Pinus ponderosa forestlands in the southwestern United States
have been important to local economies for grazing, wood prod-
ucts, and recreation. These vast forestlands furthermore are a rich
biological resource, encompassing some of the largest, contiguous
forested landscapes remaining in the continental United States.
Unfortunately, more than a century of ﬁre exclusion and other
management practices have dramatically altered forest structure
by producing high-density stands dominated by small-diameter
trees (Allen et al., 2002; Churchill et al., 2013). These dense stands
are susceptible to insect outbreaks, accelerated mortality of old
trees, and stand-replacing wildﬁre (Covington et al., 1994). Present
forests also seem ill adapted to a changing climate of warmer tem-
peratures and more extreme climatic events projected for the
semi-arid Southwest including longer durations of ﬁre weather
within years (Westerling et al., 2006). Current densely treed stands
have little understory productivity and provide poor habitat for
species dependent on open stand structures characterizing evolu-
tionary environments of P. ponderosa forests (Moore et al., 1999).
Reducing densities of small-diameter trees through mechanical
thinning is well supported in the scientiﬁc literature as a means
to reduce hazardous fuels, increase understory productivity, im-
prove individual tree growth, and enhance watershed and other
values (Fulé et al., 2012; Stephens et al., 2012b).
While there is general consensus regarding beneﬁts of tree thin-
ning, numerous perspectives exist about speciﬁc prescriptions for
how to perform tree thinning and their advantages and disadvan-
tages (e.g., Allen et al., 2002; Abella et al., 2006; Larson et al., 2012).
For example, a major source of variation among prescriptions is
where within stands to spatially retain trees during thinning. At
a spatial scale of meters to tens of meters within stands, contem-
porary P. ponderosa forests have three main vegetation patch
types: herbaceous or shrubby openings; post-settlement tree
clumps (containing two to hundreds of trees); and clumps of
pre-settlement trees (frequently containing 2–10 trees), which of-
ten exhibit little encroachment of post-settlement trees in the ﬁre-
free period (Larson and Churchill, 2012; Fig. 1). A remnant-based
thinning prescription suggests retaining post-settlement trees
(those establishing after cessation of frequent ﬁres in the late
1800s) as close as possible to remnant evidence (e.g., stumps, logs)

of pre Euro-American settlement tree locations (Covington et al.,
1997). This prescription is partly based on White (1985), who
hypothesized that locations of groups of trees, and interspersed
grassy openings, were fairly stable for hundreds and possibly thou-
sands of years in pre-settlement P. ponderosa forests. Tree estab-
lishment was thought to primarily occur as individual tree
replacement on ‘safe sites’, near existing trees, where surface ﬁres
would burn litter to expose mineral soil free from grass competi-
tion on which tree seedlings became established (White, 1985;
Mast et al., 1999). The location-based thinning prescription of Cov-
ington et al. (1997) seeks to emulate these patterns and preserve
locations of canopy openings as closely as possible by maintaining
locations of past openings and clumps of trees. In contrast, another
perspective suggests that tree thinning to reestablish structure
(e.g., clumping of trees) should leave trees primarily based on pres-
ent tree locations (e.g., retaining desired young, but large, trees
regardless of location), not past locations (Allen et al., 2002; Chur-
chill et al., 2013). This prescription can maximize use of existing
tree structure but can result in retaining post-settlement trees in
former openings while converting former treed areas to openings.
In other words, both prescriptions seek to reestablish forest struc-
ture, but they differ in emphasis on ﬁdelity to past locations of
openings and trees.
While stability of treed and opening locations and whether soil
differs between these vegetation patches could be important to
understanding tradeoffs among thinning prescriptions, few studies
have compared soil development between tree and herbaceous
patches
in
southwestern
P.
ponderosa
forests
(Welch
and
Klemmedson, 1975; Kerns et al., 2003). If differences in soil mor-
phology and other properties occur between these vegetation
patches, when other site factors (e.g., parent material) are constant,
it would suggest that locations of these patches have been stable
sufﬁciently long for vegetation to inﬂuence pedogenesis. For exam-
ple, two of the major soil orders (among 12 globally) differentiat-
ing soil developed under herbaceous or forest vegetation are
Mollisols and Alﬁsols (Buol et al., 1997). Mollisols often develop
under grassland vegetation and their major feature is formation
of a mollic epipedon, a dark-colored, organic matter-rich upper
layer of mineral soil (Anderson, 1987). The epipedon is darkened
through the process of melanization, where decomposition incor-
porates organic matter into the mineral soil (Bockheim and Gen-
nadiyev, 2000). An epipedon is not necessarily synonymous with
the A horizon, because the epipedon can also encompass upper
parts of a B horizon (Soil Survey Staff, 2010). Alﬁsols, which usually
develop under forest, are distinguished by containing a clay-en-
riched, high-base-status argillic horizon (Bt) and often contain a
horizon sequence of A/E/Bt/C (Buol et al., 1997). Mollisols and Alﬁ-
sols can require hundreds or thousands of years to develop through
soil-forming processes, yet this time scale is not necessarily incon-
sistent with even the individual tree longevity of P. ponderosa (fre-
quently >300 years and as old as >700 years; Swetnam and Brown,
1992). These observations suggest the possibility that major soil
variation at the level of different soil orders might exist among
vegetation patches at the within-stand spatial scale.
Variation in soil among vegetation patches could also have
importance for soil C storage. Carbon storage is an increasingly

soil proﬁle in (d) shows an Alﬁsol below a patch of pre-settlement trees, where an 8-cm thick O horizon occurs down to the ﬁrst nail at the 3-in. (8 cm) mark on the measuring

between the second and third nails down. Note differences in root structure between the pedons where ﬁne roots of grasses predominant in the Mollisol of (c) compared to

important consideration for forest management, as forest C is a key
part of the global C cycle and strategies for sequestering C in forests
are sought to slow global climate change (Dore et al., 2012). P. pon-
derosa forests are signiﬁcant to C storage in western North America
both because of their extensive distribution and ability to seques-
ter C. Rasmussen (2006), for example, reported that P. ponderosa
forests stored 10% of the entire soil organic C stock in Arizona, de-
spite occupying only 6% of the state, and exhibited the highest ratio
of C stored per area of any of Arizona’s major vegetation types. Rel-
ative soil C storage of vegetation patches within these forests that
make up the total is not clear. For example, one study in northern
Arizona reported that 0–5 cm mineral soil organic C concentration
was 1.6% greater in P. ponderosa compared to grassy opening
patches (Welch and Klemmedson, 1975), while another study
reported the exact opposite (Boyle et al., 2005). Moreover, soil
depth and vertical C distribution can differ among soils, making
it important to assess soil-proﬁle C storage deeper than only
surface soil.
The goal of this study was to compare soil classiﬁcation, proper-
ties, and C storage among vegetation patches (grassy openings,
openings in which trees of post-settlement origin have become
established, and clumps of pre-settlement trees) of P. ponderosa
forests. We assessed the following expectations: (1) soil morphol-
ogy (e.g., horizon thickness) differs among patches, with character-
istics such as A-horizon thickness decreasing along the gradient
from grassy openings to pre-settlement tree patches; (2) soil
chemistry differs among patches whereby pH, for example, is low-
er in tree compared to grassy patches; (3) grass patches contain
Mollisols and pre-settlement tree patches contain Alﬁsols, with
post-settlement tree patches exhibiting classiﬁcations of both
patches; and (4) C storage of the soil solum is greatest in grassy
patches.
2. Methods
2.1. Study area and study sites
We conducted this study within a P. ponderosa forest landscape
in the Coconino National Forest surrounding the City of Flagstaff in
northern Arizona, USA. Climate is semi-arid with most precipita-
tion falling as snow in winter or as summer (July–September) rain
in monsoonal storms. The Flagstaff Airport weather station, at an
elevation of 2137 m, has reported an average of 52 cm/year of pre-
cipitation, 9 C daily January low, and 28 C daily July high
(1893–2012 records; Western Regional Climate Center, Reno,
NV). Topography is primarily ﬂat to undulating, dissected by can-
yons, limestone ridges, and volcanic landforms such as cinder
cones. In the centuries preceding 1880, the approximate date of
Euro-American settlement and beginning of ﬁre exclusion, ﬁre fre-
quency averaged 2–5 years based on six ﬁre-history studies within
the study area (Van Horne and Fulé, 2006). The frequent surface
ﬁres were believed to have limited P. ponderosa regeneration,
maintaining open forests commonly with ca. 40–140 trees ha1
in 1880 (Abella and Denton, 2009). Most forests were, and are, pure
P. ponderosa. Euro-American settlement introduced new land-use
practices including livestock grazing (cattle and sheep), timber
harvest, and ﬁre exclusion (Covington et al., 1994). Since settle-
ment, density of P. ponderosa trees across the landscape has in-
creased by orders of magnitude (Fulé et al., 1997). Graminoids
(mainly native perennial grasses) historically dominated the land-
scape and do so today, although herbaceous vegetation has de-
clined overall in many areas concomitant with the increase in
tree density (Bakker and Moore, 2007). Cattle and sheep are still
grazed in some areas, but at lower stocking levels than near the
turn of the 20th century (Bakker and Moore, 2007).
The U.S. Forest Service in the study area completed a terrestrial
ecosystem survey (TES), their ecosystem classiﬁcation and map-
ping program for national forests in Arizona and New Mexico,
and mapped ecosystems (which were designated by numerical
codes) with a 16-ha minimum mapping unit (Miller et al., 1995).
The ecosystem survey included climatic data, classiﬁed soil (at
the 16-ha scale) to the family level, and soil parent material. In
our study, we sampled across ecosystem types with soil parent
material including basalt and limestone, which are predominant
parent materials in the study area (Miller et al., 1995).
We sampled four sites, selected for the study because they were
representative of the basalt and limestone soil parent material
types in the study area and because the sites had stem maps, tree
age data, and understory compositional data available from previ-
ous research (Abella and Covington, 2006; Abella and Springer,
2008; Abella and Denton, 2009). Sites had been identiﬁed by ran-
domly selecting mapping units of the ecosystem types and ran-
domly
generating
a
Universal
Transverse
Mercator
(UTM)
coordinate for the site location within a mapping unit (Abella
and Covington, 2006). Each site consisted of a 100 m  100 m
(1 ha) plot. Historical forest pattern in 1880 was reconstructed
based on dead wood (stumps, fallen logs, and snags) and live, old
trees following methods of Fulé et al. (1997).
P. ponderosa was the only tree species recorded at study sites
both in the 1880 reconstructed and the present forest. Site 1, on
basalt parent material in the 582 TES unit, had a reconstructed his-
torical tree density of 132 stems/ha and was at an elevation of
2245 m (UTM: 423,775 m E, 3,904,005 m N, zone 12, North Amer-
ican Datum 1983). Also on TES 582 basalt, site 2 had a recon-
structed density of 137 trees/ha and occupied an elevation of
2338 m (424,713 m E, 3,909,630 m N). On limestone parent mate-
rial (536 TES unit), site 3 had a reconstructed density of 65 trees/ha
and was at an elevation of 2143 m (439,919 m E, 3,886,756 m N).
Also on limestone, site 4 had a reconstructed density of 57 trees/
ha and was the driest site, occupying the lowest elevation
(2083 m; 449,861 m E, 3,893,080 m N). Owing to establishment
of post-1880 trees, current tree density exceeded 400 stems ha1
at all sites. Understory vegetation was dominated by perennial
graminoids at all sites, with basalt dominated by Muhlenbergia
montana, Festuca arizonica, and Carex geophila; the drier limestone
site by Bouteloua gracilis and M. montana; and the moister lime-
stone site by a mixture of all those species. The vegetation spatial
structure of sites consisted of clumps of old trees (establishing be-
fore 1880), grassy openings without evidence of historical trees
inhabiting them nor tree establishment after 1880, and patches
of young trees establishing in former openings.
2.2. Data collection
Within each plot, we selected for sampling the three largest
patches of old (establishing before 1880) trees (designated as
‘pre-settlement patches’), post-settlement trees (designated as
‘post-settlement patches’), and grassy openings (designated as
‘openings’). Distance between centers of these patch types could
be as little as 5 m and rarely >20 m (Fig. 1, Appendix A). Pre-settle-
ment patches were readily identiﬁable in the ﬁeld based on the
platy, orange bark that develops on old (>age 100 year) P. ponder-
osa trees (Schubert, 1974), combined with veriﬁcation through
increment coring in previous research at the sites (Abella and Den-
ton, 2009), and a typical absence of post-settlement tree establish-
ment (Fig. 1, Appendix A). Trees designated as ‘pre-settlement’
were P130 years of age (1880 establishment date) at the time of
sampling in May 2010 and typically had diameters (at 1.4 m
height) of 45–80 cm. There were between 2 and 8 live trees in
the pre-settlement patches and between 0 and approximately 5
stumps (mostly from late 1800s or early 1900s selective timber

harvests), snags, or downed logs indicative of dead pre-settlement
trees. Trees within patches were uneven-aged with establishment
dates of trees within clumps often differing by several decades.
Post-settlement patches contained between 3 and approximately
30 trees younger than age 130 years. Both pre- and post-settle-
ment patches contained trees whose bole centers were within
6 m of each other, or connected via a path of trees 66 m apart,
which was based on typical crown radii of P. ponderosa and used
in previous research (Abella and Denton, 2009; Sánchez Meador
et al., 2011). Openings were ca. 0.01–0.1 ha in size. On the contem-
porary landscape, understory plant cover was near zero in pre-set-
tlement patches, intermediate in post-settlement patches, and
greatest in openings (Abella and Springer, 2008). O horizons (litter
layers) were thickest in pre-settlement patches (often exceeding
10 cm thick, all or almost all P. ponderosa litter), intermediate in
post-settlement patches, and sparse or absent in openings (Kerns
et al., 2003).
We excavated a soil pit at the center of each of the three
patches per patch type (9 total pits site1) at each of the four
sites using a U.S. Forest Service truck-mounted backhoe. Backhoe
excavation allowed us to dig pits P1 m wide to as deep as pos-
sible (bedrock, or to >1 m for deep soils) and facilitated descrip-
tion and sampling of each horizon. Soil pits were described using
standard procedures (Soil Survey Division Staff, 1993) by soil sci-
entists (Steinke and Brewer) familiar with local soils. Soils were
classiﬁed following Soil Survey Staff (2010). A mollic epipedon
present for Mollisols partly distinguishes Mollisols from Alﬁsols,
the other dominant soil order at these sites. Criteria for designat-
ing a mollic epipedon in these soils included: (1) a Munsell color
of at least as dark as a 3/3 (value/chroma; moist soil) and organ-
ic C concentration >0.6% throughout; (2) base saturation P50%
throughout; (3) moderately hard or softer dry-soil consistency
class and coarse fragments (>2 mm in diameter) occupying
<50% of soil volume; and (4) P25 cm thick or occupying P33%
of the solum. These criteria were evaluated in the ﬁeld, with
the organic C and base saturation (as indicated through pH) cri-
teria conﬁrmed through subsequent laboratory analysis of sam-
ples. Soil pH and base saturation are positively correlated.
Beery and Wilding (1971), for example, reported that all samples
from A and B horizons of Mollisols in Ohio with pH (1:1 soil:-
water) P6.0 had base saturations exceeding 60%. Similarly, in
P. ponderosa forests, Blosser and Jenny (1971) found that no
sample with a pH > 6.0 had a base saturation <65% in A and B
horizons
from
grass-shrub
patches.
In
our
study,
samples
from only 5 (3%) of the 151 horizons analyzed in the labora-
tory had a 1:1 soil:water pH (described below) < 6.0, and the
minimum was 5.3. None of the pedons containing these 5
samples were classiﬁed as Mollisols, indicating that all pedons
classiﬁed
as
Mollisols
exhibited
pH > 6.0
throughout
the
solum.
We collected a sample of 300 cm3 for laboratory analysis
from each mineral horizon within the solum (above the C hori-
zon). Air-dried, sieved (<2 mm) soil samples were analyzed for
pH (1:1 soil:water and 1:2 soil:0.01 M CaCl2), total C, and total
N (dry combustion, vario MAX CN analyzer, Elementar, Hanau,
Germany). Free carbonate, even for the limestone soils, was rare
in the examined soils and pH in CaCl2 (which corrects for salts)
was <7 for 88% of the 151 samples, so total C was considered to
approximate organic C (Abella and Zimmer, 2007). Soil volume
occupied by coarse fragments (>2 mm in diameter) was esti-
mated through water displacement for each sample. We esti-
mated
bulk
density
for
each
horizon using
texture, coarse
fragment content, and organic C following Saxton and Rawls
(2006). Using bulk density and C and N concentrations, we cal-
culated contents of C (kg m2) and N (g m2) for each horizon.
We further calculated solum C and N content by weighting the
values for each horizon by the proportion of the solum thickness
a horizon composed.
We augmented the intensive sampling of the 36 pedons de-
scribed above at four additional sites where we only classiﬁed soils
and did not collect samples for laboratory analysis. Two sites were
on basalt parent material (582 TES), one site was on limestone (536
TES), and one site was on red volcanic cinder soil (513 TES), again
selected a priori based on their inclusion in previous historical for-
est reconstruction research (Abella and Denton, 2009). At each site,
one pit was excavated by hand to a depth of P50 cm in the largest
patch of each of the three patch types, for a total of 3 pedons de-
scribed site1 and an overall total of 12 additional pedons. Proﬁles
were described following Soil Survey Division Staff (1993) as at the
other sites.
2.3. Data analysis
Percentage of pedons classiﬁed by soil order was calculated for
each patch type, and standard descriptions of pedons were pre-
pared following Soil Survey Division Staff (1993). For the four
intensively sampled sites, we analyzed several measures of soil
characteristics among patch types. The three pedons of each patch
type per site were averaged for each site, resulting in four mean
values for analysis for each patch type for each soil variable. To
compare soil variables across patch types, sites were included as
blocks in an analysis of variance (ANOVA), with Tukey tests for
mean separation, performed in SAS (PROC GLM; SAS Institute,
2009). Degrees of freedom (DF) for whole models were 11 (mod-
el = 5, error = 6), with 3 DF for site and 2 DF for patch type. Total
A horizon thickness; B horizon thickness; A and B horizon C and
N concentration and content; solum C and N content; A and B hori-
zon pH; and C, N, and pH of the ﬁrst A horizon were compared
across patch types. The two pH measures were strongly correlated
(Pearson r = 0.94, 151 samples), so we used 1:1 soil:water pH in
statistical analyses.

3. Results
At the four intensively sampled sites, 71% of the 24 total de-
scribed pedons in opening and post-settlement tree patches were
Mollisols (Fig. 2, upper panel; Appendix A). In pre-settlement
patches, in contrast, 75% of pedons were Alﬁsols and only 25% were
Mollisols. A similar pattern characterized the four less intensively
sampled sites: 75% of pedons in openings were Mollisols, whereas
pre-settlement patches were predominately Alﬁsols including one
pedon with minimal soil development classiﬁed as an Inceptisol
(Fig. 2, lower panel).
Results of Mollisols in openings and post-settlement patches
versus Alﬁsols in pre-settlement patches were generally consistent
across sites (Appendix B). The major exception was that on lime-
stone site 3 and on red volcanic cinder soil, openings and post-set-
tlement patches often contained Typic Haplustalfs, frigid (Mollic
Eutroboralfs in earlier taxonomy). These soils demonstrated partial
Mollisol development but did not meet taxonomic criteria of
Mollisols.
In contrast to soil classiﬁcation, little difference was evident
among vegetation patches in properties of mineral soil horizons
and solum C content (Table 1). Site was signiﬁcant in ANOVA for
several variables (e.g., A horizon thickness: F = 9.9, P < 0.01; A hori-
zon pH: F = 114.4, P < 0.01), but patch type was not, consistent
with lack of patterning in means (Table 1).
4. Discussion
Variation in soil orders most frequently characterizing vegeta-
tion patches occurs on scales of meters to tens of meters within
sites on this landscape. Among 8 study sites, openings and former
openings invaded by post-settlement trees most frequently con-
tained Mollisols, whereas patches of pre-settlement trees most fre-
quently contained Alﬁsols. These ﬁndings are consistent with
expected patterns of soil development in grasslands (Mollisols,
characterizing openings) and in tree-dominated systems (Alﬁsols,
characterizing patches of pre-settlement trees). Moreover, soils in
former openings invaded by post-settlement trees during the past
ca. 100 years were predominately Mollisols. Soil variation among
patches centered on these differences in taxonomic traits and clas-
siﬁcation, because little difference was evident in means of proper-
ties such as C, N, and pH of mineral horizons among patches.
Classiﬁcation of a pedon to soil order represents a different focus
than statistical analysis of mean properties of horizons. Field iden-
tiﬁcation of a mollic epipedon, for example, hinges upon assessing
several criteria of the upper mineral soil, which can span multiple
genetic horizons, and thus is not necessarily synonymous with
analysis of genetic horizons (Soil Survey Staff, 2010). The following
sections discuss: (1) ecological differences among vegetation
patches that can affect soil-forming processes, (2) tree recruitment
patterns that might relate to observed patterns of soil develop-
ment, (3) potential inﬂuences of time and soil parent material,
and (4) ecological implications for forest management and soil C
storage.
4.1. Ecological differences among patches
Based on principles of soil genesis and plant–soil feedbacks
(e.g., Anderson, 1987; Buol et al., 1997; Kulmatiski et al., 2008),
the observed patterns of soil development among vegetation
patches likely relates to dramatic differences in biomass and nutri-
ent distribution between grassy opening and pre-settlement tree
patches. In a comprehensive study of biomass and nutrient distri-
bution in northern Arizona P. ponderosa forests, Welch and Klem-
medson (1975) illuminated several differences between grassy
and tree patches. Tree patches contained an order of magnitude
greater total plant biomass m2 (including live + dead matter
above- and below-ground) than grassy patches. However, there
were striking differences in distribution of the mass among plant
parts and vertical distribution of below-ground root mass. Root
mass comprised 39% of total plant biomass in grassy patches but
only 6% in tree patches. Root mass was 7-fold greater in the upper
0–5 cm mineral soil in grass patches than in tree patches, whereas
the deeper 5–30 cm layer contained 4-fold greater root mass in
tree than grassy patches. Additionally, the C:N ratio of total plant
mass was 17 in tree patches compared to only 4 in grass patches.
This also has implications for decomposition rates and soil nutrient
cycling in the vegetation patches (Welch and Klemmedson, 1975).
Findings of Welch and Klemmedson (1975) of greater proportion of
total plant mass harbored in roots, and in upper soil layers, in addi-
tion to plant mass lower in C:N indicative of rapid decomposition,
in grass than tree patches are consistent with Mollisol develop-
ment in grass patches. Following a principle of plant–soil feedbacks
(Kulmatiski et al., 2008), the different vegetation patches likely

inﬂuenced soil properties which in turn can inﬂuence plant devel-
opment and reinforce soil-development patterns. An example
would be Moir’s (1966) ﬁnding that perennial grasses grew larger
when experimentally grown in soil collected from openings com-
pared to soil collected below P. ponderosa. This represents a posi-
tive plant–soil feedback where the grasses grew better in their
own soil.
Studies in contemporary forests further highlight differences in
ecological processes among patches that can inﬂuence soil devel-
opment. For example, Boyle et al. (2005) reported that early sum-
mer soil respiration in a northern Arizona site was twice as high in
grass than pre-settlement tree patches, with intermediate values in
post-settlement tree patches. Kaye and Hart (1998) reported simi-
lar results for mineral soil N mineralization and nitriﬁcation: rates
were twice as high in grass than in pre-settlement tree patches.
Comparable results for nitriﬁcation (Erickson et al., 2005) and
denitriﬁcation potential (Grifﬁths et al., 2005) being greater in
openings than below conifers have been reported for Sierra Nevada
and Paciﬁc Northwest mixed conifer forests. These results collec-
tively suggest that soil processes such as decomposition and nutri-
ent cycling are fastest in openings, become rapid quickly (often
with a few years) when tree patches convert to openings (Kaye
and Hart, 1998), and would relate to soil genesis over time (Bock-
heim and Gennadiyev, 2000).
4.2. Tree recruitment and grassy opening development
P. ponderosa recruitment processes and patterns in historical
forests would seem tightly linked with patch-scale soil-forming
processes. Except in rare cases such as extremely coarse cinder
soils where tree spatial patterns were random, within-site distri-
bution (1-ha sites) of P. ponderosa trees in pre-settlement (before
1880) forests in northern Arizona was clumped (Abella and Den-
ton, 2009). Clumps contained two to maximums of 24 or more
trees (Sánchez Meador et al., 2011; Larson and Churchill, 2012).
Moreover, trees within clumps are uneven-aged (White, 1985;
Abella, 2008), not even aged as was assumed in some early re-
search (Cooper, 1961). Dendroecological analysis of temporal tree
recruitment patterns has indicated that recruitment was relatively
continuous (during life spans of trees), with only three decades
without tree establishment over a 320-year period (1550–1870)
recorded by Mast et al. (1999) on a northern Arizona basalt site
and all 29 decades between 1600 and 1890 having tree establish-
ment at a northern Arizona volcanic cinder site (Abella, 2008).
Within an existing tree clump, White (1985) suspected that ‘safe’
sites for tree recruitment could originate when ﬁre ‘scorched’ the
O horizon to expose mineral soil as a seed bed for P. ponderosa
establishment free from grass competition. After germination,
seedlings would likely require a ﬁre-free interval for development
of bark sufﬁciently thick to withstand surface ﬁres. Fire-free inter-
vals might occur at the site scale associated with climate or spatial
patterns of ignitions, or at the microsite scale (square meters) of
small areas with minimal fuel loads.
Dendroecological analyses of the uneven-aged structures of tree
patches combined with paleoecological and other research suggest
some temporal stability of vegetation patches for at least multiple
generations of trees. In a 7-ha old-growth (not harvested) P. pon-
derosa basalt site in northern Arizona, White (1985) found that a
clump contained pre-settlement-origin trees ranging in age by
268 years from age 138 to 406 years and all clumps contained trees
varying in age by at least 33 years. On a volcanic site of red cinder
used in the present study, Abella (2008) also found extreme un-
even ages within clumps, with a maximum age range of trees with-
in clumps of at least 156 years. The grassy openings also appeared
persistent in situ for long time periods, based on lack of evidence of
historical trees in openings (Sánchez Meador et al., 2011), enrich-
ment of grass phytoliths in openings (Kerns et al., 2001), and
experimental work showing that perennial grasses are highly com-
petitive with P. ponderosa seedlings and likely were a major con-
straint to tree recruitment in openings (Pearson, 1942). These
multiple lines of evidence, coupled with results of soil develop-
mental patterns that require long time periods to develop, suggest
some temporal stability on the order of centuries to millennia in
spatial locations of many tree and grass patches in historical
forests.
4.3. Inﬂuence of time and parent material
Several studies provide insight as to time required for formation
of a Mollisol and conversely time required for a Mollisol to convert
to an Alﬁsol under tree cover. In a Minnesota prairie-forest eco-
tone, Severson and Arneman (1973) found that two millennia were
sufﬁcient for Mollisols under prairie to convert to Alﬁsols under
forest, and vice versa. In a chronosequence of Pinus banksiana estab-
lishment (300–2500 years of Pinus occupancy) on prairie Mollisols,
Almendinger
(1990)
found
that
sites
invaded
by
Pinus
for
<600 years were still Mollisols whereas sites containing Pinus for
>600 years were Alﬁsols or Entisols. Buol et al. (1997, p. 190) re-
ported that mollic epipedons required 400 years to form in Wis-
consin prairies. These soil-formation estimates are consistent
with the Pcenturies to millennia time scales of tree residence in
P. ponderosa tree patches reported in dendroecological studies
(White, 1985; Mast et al., 1999; Abella, 2008).
The full length of time these soil patterns might have existed
and how original patterns formed is an intriguing, unanswered
question. This may hinge upon how ‘self-reinforcing’ (Binkley
and Giardina, 1998) the pattern was under frequent-ﬁre conditions
either through plant–soil feedbacks (Kulmatiski et al., 2008), ‘safe-
site’ tree recruitment mechanisms (White, 1985), competitive her-
baceous environments hostile to tree recruitment in openings
(Pearson, 1942), or other factors. Under the past 130 years of ﬁre
exclusion, P. ponderosa has become established in many former
openings and clearly can grow in soil of former openings (Kerns
et al., 2003). Additionally, the role of individual trees not part of
clumps warrants investigation. Individual trees typically comprise
<25% of total stand density in northern Arizona P. ponderosa forests
(Abella and Denton, 2009; Sánchez Meador et al., 2011). It is un-
clear whether these individuals were part of former clumps now
reduced to single trees, part of former clumps simply transitory
as single trees that would again become part of clumps, the begin-
nings of a new clump, or simply single trees that remain in situ or
ephemerally move across landscapes as small components of total
tree density.
It is noteworthy that many pedons in openings not classiﬁed as
Mollisols displayed partial Mollisol characteristics, and this might
reﬂect constraints by soil parent material to soil development.
For example, all patches were classiﬁed as Alﬁsols on a site with
red volcanic cinder parent material (TES = 513). However, pedons
in open and post-settlement tree patches were Typic Haplustalfs,
frigid (Mollic Eutroboralfs in earlier taxonomy), and thus while still
classiﬁed as Alﬁsols, showed partial development of Mollisol traits
which was not observed in the pre-settlement patch. Volcanic cin-
der soils contain the coarsest, driest, most nutrient-poor surface
soils that have the lowest understory plant productivity in the
study area (Abella and Covington, 2006). These soil parent materi-
als might have limited inherent capability for supporting Mollisols,
and the partial development of mollic characteristics we observed
in openings might reﬂect near-maximum soil development on
these soils. While the number of pedons (48) we described and
sites (8) we examined are large relative to many other studies of
soil development (Kerns et al., 2003), numerous factors limited
our ability to sample more sites and achieve additional replication

637

across parent materials to examine a potential interaction between
parent material and soil development in vegetation patches. It
should be noted, however, that we did ﬁnd that Mollisols or trends
toward mollic development consistently occurred more frequently
in openings than in pre-settlement tree patches across the 8 sites
encompassing three major parent material types. Magnitude of soil
development, however, might vary between vegetation patches
among parent material types (Binkley et al., 1995).
4.4. Ecological and management implications
The observed distributional pattern of soil types among vegeta-
tion patches could have several ecological implications. P. ponder-
osa clearly can become established in former openings, and the
trees grow as well or better on the Mollisol soils of openings than
on Alﬁsols (Abella et al., 2006). The converse for perennial grasses
may not be true, however. In Washington P. ponderosa forests, Moir
(1966) found that biomass of the perennial grass Festuca idahoensis
averaged 24% greater when experimentally grown in soils collected
in unburned openings than in soils collected from below P. ponder-
osa. Several experiments in contemporary forests have reported
that numerous measures such as soil respiration and N mineraliza-
tion are greater in soil of grass patches than below P. ponderosa
trees (e.g., Boyle et al., 2005; Laughlin et al., 2010). A key point is
that soil taxonomic layers such as epipedons can have important
ecological functions, such as mollic epipedons that support rapid
production and decomposition of ﬁne-material organic matter
(Anderson, 1987). These observations suggest that at least two po-
tential outcomes of expansion of Alﬁsols at the expense of Mollsols
could be reduced grass productivity and slower nutrient cycling.
Ecological implications of ﬁre to these soil patterns could be
important but need evaluation. Based on the multi-century time
scales required for formation of Mollisols and Alﬁsols, the observed
soil patterns formed or were maintained before 1900 during a fre-
quent-ﬁre regime with burns at particular locations at least as fre-
quent as every 6 years on this landscape (Van Horne and Fulé,
2006). What is not known, however, is whether frequent ﬁre, or
conversely exclusión of ﬁre since 1880, would inﬂuence soil devel-
opment. Fire’s role in soil génesis would likely hinge upon ﬁre ef-
fects on plant–soil feedbacks and nutrient cycling. For example,
ﬁre is considered to have limited P. ponderosa recruitment by kill-
ing seedlings and saplings, which could have maintained openings
(Fisher et al., 1987). Exclusion of ﬁre since 1900 has correlated with
P. ponderosa establishment in openings, raising the possibility of
existing Mollisols in openings increasingly inﬂuenced by trees to-
ward development of Alﬁsols. Fire is often thought to increase
rates of nutrient turnover between plant material and soil (Grady
and Hart, 2006). This could strengthen plant–soil feedbacks to
speed development of grass or forest soils, but the converse of slo-
wed soil development could also occur. Soil development could
slow, for example, if greater proportions of herbaceous biomass
are burned in ﬁre and thus unavailable for decomposition and
incorporation in soil (Grady and Hart, 2006). Contemporary exper-
iments evaluating soil-forming processes under or free from inﬂu-
ences of ﬁre might provide insight into effects of ﬁre management
on soil development.
Results raise several further considerations for forest manage-
ment and restoration. Long-term soil developmental patterns war-
rant consideration when developing tree thinning prescriptions for
restoration and fuel reduction in P. ponderosa forests. For example,
Allen et al. (2002) suggested that leaving large, post-settlement
trees that had invaded openings would help more rapidly reestab-
lish historical tree structure, as opposed to leaving potentially
smaller trees growing near clumps of historical trees that had died.
However, our study combined with another study of soil develop-
ment (Kerns et al., 2003) and evidence derived from dendroecology
and other types of research (e.g., White, 1985; Fisher et al., 1987),
suggest that locations of soil patches have been stable for time
periods sufﬁcient for their formation. Thus, leaving post-settle-
ment trees in former openings might gain some decades of devel-
opment of old trees and diameter growth, but occur at the expense
of centuries of soil-pattern formation. On the other hand, this
‘switching’ of tree and opening location might simply ‘re-set’ a
new cycle of Alﬁsol–Mollisol development in different locations.
As noted earlier, however, there might be at least some short-term
tradeoffs such as potentially reduced herbaceous productivity and
slowed nutrient cycling on Alﬁsol soils. Moreover, there could be a
period of ‘diluting’ soil patterns during potential initiation of Moll-
isol development on former Alﬁsols and Alﬁsol development under
trees establishing in former Mollisol openings. ‘Pedodiversity’ is an
important component of ecological site diversity that in turn can
affect numerous other ecosystem elements of diversity such as
invertebrates, vascular plants, and wildlife (Phillips and Marion,
2004). Forest management can increase, decrease, or maintain ped-
odiversity, and post-management density and location of trees can
affect pedodiversity (Scharenbroch and Bockheim, 2007; Miesel
et al., 2008). In P. ponderosa forests, clarifying time required for soil
patterns to develop below vegetation patches and potential soil
development trajectories that are initiated when spatial locations
of tree and opening patches are ‘switched’ during tree thinning
might
further
help
evaluate
tradeoffs
of
different
thinning
prescriptions.
Solum C content showed no trend to consistently differ among
vegetation patches, suggesting that tree and grass patches can
equivalently store soil C. Welch and Klemmedson (1975) reported
that total ecosystem C (standing crop + roots + litter + mineral soil)
was 23 kg m2 in patches of P. ponderosa trees 50 years old com-
pared to 9 kg m2 in grassy patches in northern Arizona. The stor-
age components dramatically differed: tree patches stored only
32% of total ecosystem C in mineral soil whereas grass patches
stored 91%. Moreover, high C storage in litter/woody debris and
standing crop of P. ponderosa systems is not necessarily sustain-
able. Carbon in woody plant material, and the corresponding fuel
load, has escalated in these forests during the past 130 years of
exclusion of frequent surface ﬁre (Fulé et al., 2012). Large wildﬁres
are increasingly converting P. ponderosa forests to grasslands and
shrublands, with these severely burned areas being net sources
of C to the atmosphere for at least 15 years (Dore et al., 2012). Re-
search is increasingly demonstrating that while tree thinning tem-
porarily (<20 years) reduces ecosystem C storage, this tradeoff is
dramatically offset compared to C losses from likely inevitable
stand-replacing wildﬁres (e.g., Dore et al., 2012; Stephens et al.,
2012a). Stand structure including mixtures of tree and open
patches – similar to forest structure under historical frequent-ﬁre
regimes – is considered the most sustainable type of P. ponderosa
forest for sequestering C, in addition to providing balanced habitat
values (Dore et al., 2012; Stephens et al., 2012a). Our result of no
difference in total solum C storage between tree and grass patches
is important in indicating no negative tradeoff in mineral soil C
storage
with
increasing
proportions
of
forests
occupied
by
openings.
Another important consideration is area occupied by the patch
types and their corresponding soil types on a site basis. Sánchez
Meador et al. (2011) reported that area occupied by trees in pre-
settlement forests was only 11–19%, while openings occupied
81–89%, at six sites in northern Arizona P. ponderosa forests. This
suggests that with regards to reference conditions, most area was
occupied by mollic soil historically and still is presently because
most post-settlement tree patches harbored Mollisols. While we
did not ﬁnd that average soil C storage differed among patch types,
on an area basis total C storage in Mollisols would overwhelm that
of Alﬁsols on a site basis because of area dominance by Mollisols.

Results suggest that the soil development pattern of mostly mollic-
like soil with minor components of Alﬁsol soil associated with tree
patches across sites can be added to Moore et al.’s (1999) inventory
of reference conditions as an ecological basis for management in
southwestern P. ponderosa forests.
5. Management recommendations and further research
Turnover in soil taxonomic classes occurred on scales of meters
to tens of meters corresponding with distribution of vegetation
patch types in northern Arizona P. ponderosa forests. Results sug-
gest that Mollisols predominated in grassy openings and openings
invaded by post-settlement trees <130 years old, whereas Alﬁsols
dominated patches of pre-settlement-origin trees. These ﬁndings
illuminate a potential tradeoff regarding spatial locations of ‘leave’
trees during forest thinning projects: leaving young, large trees in
former openings may gain decade’s worth of tree growth relative
to retaining young, smaller trees in former tree patches, yet result
in ‘homogenization’ of potentially centuries to millennia of soil
development. At any given site, the magnitude of this tradeoff
likely hinges upon how many young trees (and their sizes) are
growing in former openings relative to young trees in pre-settle-
ment tree patches and whether soil developmental patterns are gi-
ven consideration in the thinning prescription (Abella et al., 2006).
Maintaining pedodiversity, such as spatial patterns of soil orders,
can be an important goal in forest management for balancing
numerous management objectives such as promoting large-tree
structure, herbaceous productivity, and C storage (Scharenbroch
and Bockheim, 2007).
If maintaining existing soil patterns is a goal in restoration tree
thinning and fuel reduction projects, a conservative approach
likely is maintaining locations of openings and old tree patches
through prescriptions that remove young trees from openings
and leave trees near evidence of historical tree locations. Examples
of these remnant-based prescriptions are discussed in Covington
et al. (1997), Abella et al. (2006), and Roccaforte et al. (2009). When
evidence of historical trees is not available (e.g., if stumps were
burned by wildﬁre or removed by harvest operations) or when
maximizing use of existing tree structure is a goal (Allen et al.,
2002), prescriptions such as Larson et al. (2012) that restore/main-
tain the structure of tree clumps and openings – but not necessar-
ily in their past locations – might be appropriate. This prescription
might initiate new long-term soil development patterns in differ-
ent locations than in the past. The possible tradeoffs of soil
‘homogenization’ and reduced herbaceous productivity warrant
consideration in this situation, but so does a possible beneﬁt of
the prescription of more rapidly achieving clumps of large trees
regardless of their location. Given the strength of soil patterns
we found on this landscape, including soil development as an eval-
uated ecological response when experimenting with a range of
possible restoration and fuel reduction prescriptions in today’s for-
ests is warranted.
Our results further highlight some important topics for future
research. It could be informative to explore precisely how long for-
mation of Mollisols and Alﬁsols require (or switch from one to the
other under different vegetation) in western coniferous forests; to
better understand potential interactive effects on soil development
between soil parent material and vegetation patches; and to more
fully examine numerous ecological responses (e.g., nutrient cy-
cling, herbaceous productivity) to ‘rotating’ locations of soil
patches. Moreover, understanding how widespread the soil pattern
highlighted by our results is in western North American frequent-
ﬁre coniferous forests is important, because thinning and fuel
reduction are similarly needed for restoration and ﬁre manage-
ment across the region (Fulé et al., 2012; Stephens et al., 2012b;
Churchill et al., 2013). Perennial grasses dominate understory veg-
etation on our landscape, for example, whereas shrubs or forbs
dominate understories of other landscapes which might inﬂuence
soil development. Linkages of soil genesis with existing, and
post-management, within-site vegetation patterns warrant consid-
eration and further investigation in restoration and fuel reduction
forest management activities.

Geographic setting: These soils occupy elevated plains on up-
lands at elevations from 1975 to 2200 m above the Mogollon
Rim on the Coconino National Forest and in close proximity to
Flagstaff, Arizona. These soils occur in P. ponderosa forests and in
ecotones between P. ponderosa forests and Pinus-Juniperus wood-
lands. Slope gradients of 0–5% are most common while the full
range is from 0% to 15%. These soils formed in residuum from lime-
stone. Mean annual precipitation is 46–56 cm, and mean annual air
temperature is 5 C with a frost-free period of 100–110 days.
Pedon location: Coconino County, Arizona, 4 km southeast of
the City of Flagstaff, at an elevation of 2083 m and geographic coor-
dinates of 449,851 m E, 3,893,077 m N (UTM, North American Da-
tum 1983).

Patch type: pre-settlement tree patch, Alﬁsol.
Taxonomic class: loamy-skeletal, mixed, frigid, very cobbly
sandy loam, Lithic Haplustalfs.
Description: These soils consist of shallow, well-drained soils
formed in residuum from Kaibab limestone. This representative
pedon was described within a P. ponderosa forest in a patch con-
taining trees of pre-settlement origin. Colors are for moist soil un-
less otherwise noted.
Oi – 8–3 cm; slightly decomposed P. ponderosa needles.
Oe – 3–0 cm; moderately decomposed P. ponderosa needles.
A&B – 0–8 cm; dark reddish brown and reddish brown (5YR
3/3 & 4/4) very cobbly sandy loam, reddish brown and yellow-
ish red (5YR 4/3 & 4/6) dry; weak ﬁne subangular blocky

Btk – 8–23 cm; dark reddish brown (5YR3/4) extremely cobbly
ﬁne sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) dry; weak ﬁne subangular
blocky structure; friable; common faint clay ﬁlms on ped faces and
pores; few ﬁne tubular pores; few ﬁne and medium roots; dissem-
inated lime threads on ped faces; violently effervescent.
Evidence of pedoturbation from animal activity was common
throughout this soil.
Geographic setting: These soils occupy elevated plains on up-
lands at elevations from 1975 to 2200 m above the Mogollon
Rim on the Coconino National Forest and in close proximity to
Flagstaff, Arizona. These soils occur in P. ponderosa forests and in
ecotones between P. ponderosa forests and Pinus-Juniperus wood-
lands. Slope gradients of 0 to 5% are most common while the full
range is from 0% to 15%. These soils formed in residuum from lime-
stone. Mean annual precipitation is 46–56 cm, and mean annual air
temperature is 5 C with a frost-free period of 100–110 days.
Pedon location: Coconino County, Arizona, 4 km southeast of
the City of Flagstaff, at an elevation of 2083 m and geographic coor-
dinates of 449,909 m E, 3,893,067 m N (UTM, North American Da-
tum 1983).

Appendix B.
Soil classiﬁcation results by vegetation patch type for 8 sites in a
P. ponderosa forest landscape in northern Arizona, USA. There were
two sets of sites: 4 intensively sampled sites including soil labora-
tory analysis and 4 sites only of soil classiﬁcation. Three pedons
were described per patch type for intensive sites and one pedon
was described per patch type for the classiﬁcation-only sites.
