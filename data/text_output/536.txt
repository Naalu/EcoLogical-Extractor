ABSTRACT
Old-growth ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests are uncommon in the Southwest, and only one old-
growth forest (the Gus Pearson Natural Area [GPNA]) has been researched in the ponderosa pine belt sur-
rounding the city of Flagstaff in northern Arizona. The purpose of this study was to measure soil characteris-
tics, current and pre-Euro-American settlement (1885) tree structure, and understory plant composition in a
6-ha remnant old-growth forest on volcanic, red cinder soils. Soil bulk density was extremely low (0.21
Mg/m3) in this forest because of high volumetric contents of cinders >2 mm diameter. As a result, volumetric
soil moisture, organic C, and total N contents were low, with June gravimetric moisture (0-15 cm) averaging
<1%. Despite these seemingly inhospitable soils, the reconstructed ponderosa pine presettlement density of
183/ha is among the highest reported for northern Arizona. Current density of live presettlement-origin trees
also is high (104/ha), including 36 trees/ha that established before 1700. On a 1-ha plot, the live tree age
structure reconstructed for 1885 suggested that all 29 decades between 1600 and 1890 had at least one tree
establish. These temporal establishment patterns are more constant than those reported at the GPNA, but do
support GPNA findings of uneven-agedness within tree groups. Plant communities were dominated by moun-
tain muhly (Muhlenbergia montana) and other species of xeric affinity. Several ecological properties at this
site differed sharply from the GPNA, which occupies moist basalt soils, and the site is a member of a red
cinders/Bahia ecosystem type that is among the rarest in this region. 
INTRODUCTION
Old-growth forests have ecological and human
values that frequently differ from younger forests.
For example, old trees can represent reservoirs of
genetic diversity because they established in a dif-
ferent time period than younger trees (Beckman and
Mitton 1984). Old trees also have recorded long
climatic records in their tree rings, important for
reconstructing past climate in climate change
research (Grissino-Mayer et al. 1997). While char-
acteristics of old-growth forests vary both within
and among forest types, old forests often provide
unique habitat by containing large trees, snags,
abundant dead wood, characteristic microclimates
and soils, or other features specific to a forest type
(Morgan et al. 2002). Humans in North America
also have obtained timber from old forests, and
increasingly appreciate old forests for aesthetic,
ecological, and other values (Davis 1996).
Old trees have declined in density in southwest-
ern United States ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa
P. & C. Lawson) forests because of past timber har-
vest and also likely from accelerated mortality assoc-
iated with deleterious ecosystem changes (Mast et al.
1999). Old trees in these forests are typically defined
as trees that established before Euro-American
settlement (“presettlement”) in the late 1800s. Since
settlement, old trees and forests have been impacted
by surface-fire exclusion, livestock grazing, and
irruptions of young, postsettlement trees (Covington
et al. 1997, Allen et al. 2002, Abella 2004). These
postsettlement changes, together with a historical
disturbance regime of frequent fire (Swetnam and
Baisan 1996) and successional pattern of individual-
tree replacement (White 1985), make it difficult to
define old-growth ponderosa pine forests in the
Southwest (Covington and Moore 1994).  
Despite this uncertainty in precisely defining
old growth in ponderosa pine forests, the ~ 5-ha Gus
Pearson Natural Area (GPNA) within the Coconino
National Forest, 10 km northwest of the city of
Flagstaff in northern Arizona, has been identified as
old growth (Covington et al. 1997, Stone et al.
1999). Ecologists have viewed the GPNA as old
growth because the site is essentially unharvested,
while recognizing that it does not match presettle-
ment conditions because of irruptions of postsettle-
ment pine densities, fire exclusion, fuel buildups,
and other factors (White 1985, Covington et al.
1997, Mast et al. 1999). The GPNA has served as a
valuable reference site for many ecological studies,
including those of presettlement tree regeneration
and age structure (White 1985, Mast et al. 1999),
soil properties (Kaye and Hart 1998), old-tree
physiology (Stone et al. 1999), and ecological

restoration experiments (Covington et al. 1997,
Laughlin et al. 2006). 
The GPNA occurs on moist, silt loam basalt
soils that are among the most productive soils for
tree growth and understory plant biomass in the
Flagstaff area (Abella and Covington 2006a). There
are no known published studies reporting character-
istics of old-growth forests on other or drier soil
types surrounding Flagstaff. Using a landscape eco-
system framework, Barnes (1989) highlighted the
importance of abiotic factors (soils and topography)
in influencing the biotic characteristics (e.g., tree
sizes, density, and plant composition) of old-growth
forests. Understanding this variation is important for
several reasons, including when identifying guide-
lines or ranges of variability for defining old forests
(Keddy and Drummond 1996), estimating presettle-
ment reference conditions (Morgan et al. 2002), and
for maintaining or restoring old forests (Habeck
1990).  
During fieldwork for a landscape ecosystem
classification (Abella and Covington 2006a, b), I
encountered an essentially unharvested, remnant
old-growth forest dominated by presttlement-origin
ponderosa pine on dry, red volcanic cinder soils
(Fig. 1). The site is located within the Coconino
National Forest, 20 km northeast of Flagstaff and
4.5 km west of the western border of Sunset Crater
National Monument. The objectives of this study
were to: (1) quantify soil characteristics, (2)
measure current and reconstruct presettlement tree
structure and age distribution, and (3) assess under-
story plant species composition in this old-growth
forest.  
        
METHODS
Study Site
The remnant forest is ~6 ha in size and occupies
an upper, northeast-facing (65E) slope of a cinder
cone (Universal Transverse Mercator, NAD83,
446730 m E, 3915773 m N, zone 12). Based on
clinometer measurements, slope gradients average
43%. Elevation of the site is 2,326 m. Soils are
derived from volcanic cinders, and are classified as
frigid, ashy-skeletal, Vitrandic Ustochrepts or frigid,
cindery, Typic Ustorthents (Miller et al. 1995). Cli-
matic means are available from the nearby Sunset
Crater National Monument weather station (1969-
2005 records), 5 km east of the study area at 2,128
m elevation (Western Regional Climate Center,
Reno, NV). This station recorded an average of 43
cm/yr of total precipitation, 153 cm/yr of snowfall,
and average monthly high temperatures ranging
from 7EC (January) to 29EC (July). The study site is
classified as the 513 Terrestrial Ecosystem Survey
type by the U.S. Forest Service (Miller et al. 1995),
and as a red cinders/Bahia ecosystem type in an
ecosystem classification of the Flagstaff area
(Abella and Covington 2006a).

tlement) ponderosa pine density was 183 trees/ha,
sharply higher than published densities of other sites in
the Flagstaff area. The site contained 104 live pines/ha
that established before 1885, 21 of which had evidence
of fire scarring (c).

 Environmental Measurements
In June 2003, I established a 100 × 100 m (1 ha)
plot in the center of the site and located a 20 × 25 m
(0.05 ha) plot near the center of the large plot. At
the northeast and southeast corners of the 0.05-ha
plot, I dug a soil pit 50 cm deep. I collected soil
samples for laboratory analysis from 0-15 and 15-50
cm depths, and composited samples from the two
pits separately for each depth. I also examined
deeper layers using a bucket auger. Soil samples
were air dried, sieved through a 2-mm sieve, and
analyzed for CaCO3 equivalent (Goh et al.'s [1993]
approximate gravimetric method), texture (hydro-
meter method), pH (1:2 soil:0.01 M CaCl2), and
organic C and total N (elemental C/N analyzer) fol-
lowing Sparks (1996) and Dane and Topp (2002). I
measured gravel concentration by sieving as the
weight of material >2 mm diameter. I also measured
soil color on air-dry samples using Munsell color
charts. On 19 June 2004, during the driest period of
the year in this region when no precipitation had
fallen since April (Western Regional Climate
Center, Reno, NV), I collected two soil cores each
of 208 cm3 from a 0-15 cm depth. Using these cores,
I measured gravimetric soil moisture by 105EC oven
drying for 24 hr, and bulk density by sieving out
gravel >2 mm diameter. I also collected ~250 g of
cinders to measure their density with volume com-
puted by water displacement.   
    
Tree Sampling
On the 1-ha plot in 2004, I mapped all live trees
and evidence of presettlement trees (snags, fallen
logs, and stumps). I selected the year 1885 to repre-
sent settlement and initiation of fire exclusion,
which has been consistently measured as the mid-
1870s to 1880s in the Flagstaff area (Fulé et al.
1997, Mast et al. 1999). Because of relatively slow
decomposition in these semi-arid forests and exclu-
sion of fire since settlement, re-location of presettle-
ment structures has been shown to be reliable within
10% (Moore et al. 2004). I recorded the diameter at
breast height (DBH; 1.37 m) of live trees and snags,
and the diameter at stump height (DSH; 40 cm) of
stumps and fallen logs. I also noted the presence or
absence of fire scars on snags and live trees.
I collected increment cores at stump height from
all live ponderosa pine trees >10 cm DBH, and from
25% of trees <10 cm DBH that I selected to encom-
pass a range of diameter and height. I also collected
cores from non-rotten snags. Cores were sanded,
mounted, and cross-dated (Stokes and Smiley 1968)
using tree-ring chronologies from the Flagstaff area.
If the pith was missed in a core, center dates were
estimated with a pith locator. Tree center dates cor-
respond to the 40-cm tall coring height, which has
been conventionally used in this region as a com-
promise between accuracy of age and growth mea-
surements (Mast et al. 1999). Radial growth also
was measured on cores by decade.   
To reconstruct tree DBH in 1885, I estimated
DBH from DSH of presettlement-origin stumps and
fallen logs using equations in Myers (1963). I esti-
mated DBH in 1885 from radial growth measure-
ments from cores of live presettlement-origin trees
and for snags from which complete cores could be
obtained. Using a DBH-age regression equation
from all trees from which complete cores were
obtained (n=137, r2=0.66), I estimated ages at the
time of death for stumps, fallen logs, and snags that
could not be dated. I assumed that stumps were cut
near 1885, suggested by their grey color and appear-
ance (Mast et al. 1999). Based on local models of
snagfall and decomposition and also on their visual
appearance in the field (Rogers et al. 1984), fallen
logs and snags that could not be crossdated were
most likely live trees in 1885. I compared patterns
of tree establishment in 10- and 20-year increments
to the Palmer Drought Severity Index (Cook 2000)
using Pearson correlation.   
           
Understory Sampling
On the 0.05-ha plot within the 1-ha plot, I cate-
gorized areal percent cover of each understory plant
species rooted in 15, 1-m2 (1 × 1 m) subplots. Sub-
plots were systematically centered at 0.5, 5, 12.5,
20, and 24.5 m along the bottom, middle, and top
plot axes. Cover was categorized as 0.1, 0.25, 0.5,
and 1% up to 1% cover, 1% intervals to 10% cover,
and 5% intervals above 10% cover. I also surveyed
the whole 0.05-ha plot for species not already
detected in subplots, and assigned these species the
lowest average cover value of 0.007% (0.1% in 1/15
subplots). I calculated relative cover of each species
as the percent of total cover of all species. Sampling
occurred in June 2003, and nomenclature and
classification of species as native or exotic followed
USDA-NRCS (2004).  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Environment
Soil texture was sandy loam for both the 0-15
and 15-50 cm depths (Table 1). Gravel concentra-
tions (volcanic cinders) by weight were near 50%
(Table 1), which translates to greater concentration
by volume because the density of the cinders was
only 1.9 g/cm3. This density is lower than typical
rock densities of basalt (3.0 g/cm3), limestone (2.7
g/cm3), or sandstone (2.4 g/cm3) summarized in
Hyndman (1985). Bulk density of the 0-15 cm depth

4
UNIQUE OLD-GROWTH PONDEROSA PINE FOREST g ABELLA
was extremely low, because most of the soil volume
was occupied by cinders and very little by soil
particles <2 mm diameter. Bulk density at this site
is 4-6 times lower than typical bulk densities of
0.8-1.2 for forest and grassland soils (Brady and
Weil 1999), and also is less than a bulk density of
0.9 Mg/m3 reported for the GPNA on basalt soils
(Kaye and Hart 1998). High gravel volumes and
correspondingly low bulk densities reduce rooting
volume, available water holding capacity, and nutri-
ent contents (Welch and Klemmedson 1975). For
example, if concentrations by weight of total N
(Table 1) are converted to a volumetric basis using
bulk density, 0-15 cm N content is only 378 kg/ha
at this site. This is about four times lower than con-
tents of 1,431-1,726 kg N/ha reported for the GPNA
(Kaye and Hart 1998). During a precipitation-free
period in June, gravimetric soil moisture of the
upper 15 cm was only 0.7% by weight and 0.6% by
volume. Soil pH was slightly below neutral and is
high for the Flagstaff area, comparable to limestone-
derived soils near Walnut Canyon National Monu-
ment (Abella and Covington 2006a).   
While this site occupies a northeastern aspect
which tends to be a moist aspect, its upper topo-
graphic position and steep slopes may reduce infil-
tration (Dyer 2002). Inherent soil properties, how-
ever, are probably most strongly related to the site's
paltry soil moisture (Table 1). While surface soils
appear more hospitable for understory plant growth
than nearby black cinder soils such as at Sunset
Crater National Monument (Hanks et al. 1983), this
site does not seem to contain (based on bucket
augering) the deep soils often typifying black cinder
soils (Abella and Covington 2006a). These deep
soils favor root expansion and resource uptake over
large soil volumes, often facilitating rapid ponder-
osa pine diameter growth on black cinder soils,
which would not be expected to occur on the shal-
lower soils at this site (Haasis 1921).   
            
Tree Density and Basal Area
Density of live trees in 2004 totaled 190/ha,
which included 9 limber pine (Pinus flexilis James)
and 181 ponderosa pine (Fig. 2). Reconstructed den-
sity in 1885 was 183 ponderosa pine/ha, of which
104 were still alive in 2004. This presettlement
ponderosa pine density exceeds those previously
reported for other sites around Flagstaff and many
other areas in northern Arizona. For example, pre-
viously reported presettlement densities (ponderosa
pine trees/ha) in the Flagstaff area include 54 near
Walnut Canyon (Menzel and Covington 1997), 56
at Bar-M-Canyon (Covington and Moore 1994), 60
at the GPNA (Mast et al. 1999), 65 at Camp Navajo
(Fulé et al. 1997), and 54-117 at five sites on the
Coconino National Forest (Moore et al. 2004). Den-
sity at my study site also exceeds those at Mt. Trum-
bull in northwestern Arizona (14-65 trees/ha; Waltz
et al. 2003), and at two Grand Canyon south rim
sites (65-72 trees/ha; Fulé et al. 2002). Presettlement
density at my site more closely resemble, although
are still higher than, north rim sites ranging from
132-156 trees/ha (Fulé et al. 2002). It is unclear why
presettlement densities are so high at this site, and it
seems particularly unusual because the site's dry
soils seem inhospitable  to tree establishment (Table
1). Two other sites on red cinder soils near

Flagstaff had low presettlement den-
sities of 17 and 28/ha (S. R. Abella,
unpubl. data).
I encountered only five stumps/
ha (Fig. 2), two of which I noted dif-
ficulty in determining whether the
trees had been cut or had broken off,
suggesting that this minimal harvest
or snag-felling level is similar to that
reported for the GPNA (Covington et
al. 1997). It is possible that the site's
relatively steep slopes and only
small-medium sized trees forestalled
tree harvesting. There were an addi-
tional 49 fallen logs/ha of probable
presettlement origin, and 25 snags/ha
of presettlement origin.    
Contemporary and reconstructed
1885 basal area both averaged
15 m2/ha. Density of trees >40 cm
DBH increased from 44/ha in 1885 to
51/ha in 2004 (Fig. 3). The largest live
tree in 2004 had a DBH of 72 cm,
with the largest tree in 1885 having an
80-cm DBH.
Twenty-one 
live 
trees 
of
presettlement origin and five snags
exhibited fire scarring (Fig. 1c) on
the 1-ha plot. While fire-history
reconstruction was not undertaken in
this study, other research has found
that fire-return intervals were
generally <15 years in southwestern ponderosa pine
forests (Swetnam and Baisan 1996, Fulé et al.
1997). The high density of fire scars on the site,
which all occurred on the uphill side of boles, could
reflect especially frequent fire possibly due to
topography or dry soils, high densities of remaining
presettlement live trees and snags, or other factors
(Gutsell and Johnson 1996). 
        
Tree Age Structure
Of 152 cored live trees or recent snags, com-
plete cores could be obtained from 137, partial cores
to establish minimum ages of 10, and five cores
were rotten or otherwise could not be read. Of 104
live presettlement trees, complete cores were
obtained from 92, partial from 9, and only 3 trees
had unreadable cores. Age structure in 2004 of all
live trees indicated that some decades were better
represented than others (Fig. 4a). Thirty-six (35%)
of the 104 live presettlement trees established before
1700, and 32 (31%) established between 1700 and
1800. The oldest tree able to be dated had a center
date of 1606 (age = 399 years) at 40 cm height, and
a 72-cm DBH tree had a partial core dated to 1766
and an estimated establishment date using DBH of
1585 (age = 420 years). In their compilation of
oldest known conifers, Swetnam and Brown (1992)
reported that a ponderosa pine near Littlefield, AZ,
was established in 1243 (age = 742 years at the time
of sampling).   
In both the 2004 and reconstructed 1885 age
structures, decades with an absence of trees do not
necessarily imply that no trees established during
those decades. Trees may have established but were
dead in 2004 or 1885 and thus were not part of the
live tree age structure. In the reconstructed 1885 age
structure, however, 27 of the 29 decades between
1600 and 1890 had dated trees that established (Fig.
4b). Both remaining decades had trees that were
estimated to have established based on DBH-age
relationships. Presettlement tree establishment at
this site was much more prolific with fewer
establishment-free periods than was discovered at
the GPNA (Mast et al. 1999). At the GPNA, Mast et
al. (1999) found that age structure in 1876 contained
three decades (midpoints of 1605, 1755, and 1765)
from 1600 to 1880 in which no trees established.
These researchers also sampled 4.7 ha compared to
Figure 3.  Diameter distributions in 2004 and reconstructed for 1885 at
the time of Euro-American settlement for an old-growth ponderosa pine
forest on red cinder soils, northern Arizona.  All trees included in the

1 ha in my study, amplifying my findings because
greater sample area would be expected to increase
probabilities of encountering trees establishing in
different decades. However, owing to the higher
presettlement tree density on my site, the number of
trees included in the presettlement age reconstruc-
tions are comparable (203 in Mast et al. [1999] and
183 in my study). From the 1550s to 1870s, Mast et
al. (1999) reported a maximum establishment of 3.6
trees/ha/decade. The average establishment of 5.2
trees/ha/decade in the 33 decades during this period
at my site is higher than the GPNA maximum. How-
ever, similar to the GPNA (White 1985, Mast et al.
1999), I found that presettlement trees occurred in
uneven-aged groups, often with large differences in
establishment dates between nearby trees (Fig. 1b).
Although presettlement establishment density
and constancy differed between the GPNA and my
site, general peaks of establishment were temporally
similar at the two sites. At the GPNA, a peak in
establishment occurred between 1680 and 1720
(Mast et al. 1999), which also corresponded with
elevated establishment densities at my site (Fig.
4b). However, these regeneration patterns were not
easily related to the Palmer Drought Severity Index
(Cook 2000), with correlations (Pearson r) of < 0.10
for tree establishment densities in 10- or 20-year
increments. This finding is similar to the GPNA
results of Mast et al. (1999), who suggested that
combining more detailed climatic patterns with fire
frequencies and other factors may be needed to
explain temporal patterns of presettlement tree

regeneration. In contrast, Boyden et al. (2005) con
cluded that tree establishment was generally related
to wet years, as estimated by the Palmer Drought
Severity Index, in an old-growth Colorado Front
Range ponderosa pine stand. 
  
Tree Growth    
DBH-age relationships indicate that tree growth
has been slow on this site (Fig. 5), consistent with
the site's dry, gravelly soils (Table 1) and possibly
with intraspecific competition related to high
presettlement tree densities. For example, a 67-cm
DBH tree is predicted to be 390 years old at stump
height. In comparison, Stone et al. (1999) found that
20 presettlement trees averaging 67-cm DBH aver-
aged only 198 years old on productive soils at the
GPNA.
Understory Community
The 0.05-ha sample plot contained 32 plant
species, all of which are classified by USDA-NRCS
(2004) as native (Table 2).  At a finer scale, richness
averaged 3.4 species/m2. This richness is relatively
low, with richness averaging 5.9 species/m2 at other
sites of the red cinders/Bahia ecosystem and as high
as 9.7 species/m2 in open park grassland ecosystems
surrounding Flagstaff (Abella and Covington 2006a).
Species composition was dominated by mountain
muhly (Muhlenbergia montana [Nutt.] A.S. Hitchc.),
a C4 photosynthetic species predicted to thrive on dry
sites (Sage and Monson 1999). Other species also
frequent in sandy or dry environments in this region
typified species composition (Abella and Covington
2006b), such as blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis
[Willd. ex Kunth] Lag. ex Griffiths), Fendler's sand-
mat (Chamaesyce fendleri [Torr. & Gray] Small),
sand-dune wallflower (Erysimum capitatum [Dougl.
ex Hook.] Greene), and ragleaf bahia (Bahia dissecta
[Gray] Britt.). 
There was no visual indication during plot
sampling of large ungulate grazing at the site, and
no known nearby water sources. However, it is
unclear how well current plant composition repre-
sents presettlement composition for at least two
potential reasons. It is possible that past livestock
grazing changed species composition (Clary 1975).
Additionally, fire exclusion since settlement may
have affected composition (Laughlin et al. 2004).
Nevertheless, current composition seemingly is con-
sistent with species photosynthetic pathways and
tolerances for these dry, infertile soils.

ment tree density, soil properties, and understory

composition, sharply differed from another old-
growth site near Flagstaff, the intensively
researched GPNA (e.g., Covington et al. 1997, Kaye
and Hart 1998, Mast et al. 1999). The site described
in this study is unique because it: occupies extreme-
ly dry red cinder soils which are rare in the Flagstaff
area, contained an exceptionally high ponderosa
pine presettlement density (183/ha), exhibited a tree
establishment pattern fairly constant over time in
presettlement forests, is characterized by unusually
slow tree growth rates for this region, currently has
an uncommonly high density of live presettlement-
origin trees (104/ha) including 36/ha that estab-
lished before 1700, has a high density (26/ha) of
fire-scarred trees or snags, and displays a unique
plant species composition with a predominately
xeric affinity.
Red cinders/Bahia ecosystems, of which this
site is a member, historically were rare and are cur-
rently rare based on their soils distribution (Abella
and Covington 2006a). Soils supporting this eco-
system type occupy <1840 ha (<1.7%) of the north
half of the Coconino National Forest (Miller et al.
1995). About 9/32 (28%) of this ecosystem's map-
ping units (>30% of its area) also have been burned
by crown fires since 1950 (Coconino National
Forest, Flagstaff, AZ, unpubl. data). Attention could
be given to performing restoration or fuel reduction
treatments to protect remaining sites from crown
fire. Based on the large differences between this
old-growth site and the GPNA, sampling other old-
growth forests, if and where they exist, on other soil
types may facilitate better understanding, definition,
and identification of old forests in this region..
