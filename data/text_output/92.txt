Restoration and Monitoring
Cheatgrass Encroachment on a Ponderosa 
Pine Forest Ecological Restoration Project  
in Northern Arizona
Christopher M. McGlone, Judith D. Springer and W. Wallace Covington
Abstract
Land managers frequently thin small-diameter trees and apply prescribed fire to reduce fuel loads and restore ecosystem 
structure, function, and process in forested areas. There is increasing concern that disturbances associated with these 
management practices can facilitate non-native plant invasions. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), an annual grass from the 
Mediterranean, has invaded large areas of the interior West and has become the dominant species in many of these areas. 
In 2003, a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) ecological restoration site on Mount Trumbull in the Uinkaret Mountains of 
northern Arizona experienced a large increase in cheatgrass. Thinning and burning projects had been conducted on this 
site since 1996. Cheatgrass cover increased 90-fold on the thinned and burned plots between 1996 and 2003. While 
cheatgrass also increased on thinned plots that were not burned and the untreated control plots, the cover of cheatgrass 
remained low. There were two additional factors that may have influenced the cheatgrass invasion. In 2002, the region 
experienced the most extreme drought recorded in the past 100 years. Substantial rainfall returned to the area in Sep-
tember 2002, coincident with the timing of cheatgrass germination. Additionally, cattle were reintroduced to the study 
area in August 2002 after a four-year hiatus in grazing. We present data suggesting that the interaction of prescribed fire 
and small-diameter tree thinning, potentially exacerbated by cattle grazing and drought, was the primary cause of the 
spread of cheatgrass. Furthermore, we offer management recommendations for reducing the risk of non-native plant 
invasion on ecological restoration projects.

T
here is increasing concern among 
ecologists, land managers, and 
other stakeholders over the risk of 
aggressive, non-native plant species 
spreading into forested areas treated 
for ecological restoration (Moore et 
al. 1999, Allen et al. 2002, Keeley 
et al. 2003). Ecological restoration 
applications, such as thinning small-
diameter trees and prescribed fire 
(hereafter referred to as thinning and 
burning), are intended to reinvigorate 
all aspects of forest health, particularly 
by increasing understory vegetation 
cover and reducing severe wildfires 
(Covington et al. 1997, Moore et 
al. 1999). Disturbances generated 
by tree removal, slash pile burning, 
prescribed fire, and associated human 
activities can, however, create oppor-
tunities for non-native plant invasions 
(D’Antonio and Meyerson 2002, Korb 
et al. 2004). Increases in non-native 
plant abundance have been docu-
mented in ponderosa pine (Pinus pon-
derosa) forests that were thinned and 
burned (Griffis et al. 2001, Wienk et 
al. 2004, Dodson and Fiedler 2006). 
In spite of the risk of invasion, there 
is evidence that forests treated with 
prescribed fire are less susceptible to 
non-native plant encroachment than 
areas burned in wildfires (Crawford 
et al. 2001, Griffis et al. 2001). Not 
all wildfires in the Southwest have 
facilitated non-native plant invasions, 
suggesting additional factors such as 
proximity to seed sources and preva-
lence of transport mechanisms are also 
important (Laughlin et al. 2004).
A non-native plant species of partic-
ular concern in the interior American 
West is cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum). 
Cheatgrass was introduced to the 
United States in the late 1800s and 
has since spread throughout much of 
the Great Basin Desert and the sur-
rounding mountains and grasslands 
(Mack 1981, Knapp 1996). In areas 
it has invaded, cheatgrass has reduced 
plant biodiversity (Mack 1981), 
altered soil characteristics (Evans et 
al. 2001, Norton et al. 2004), and 
substantially changed the local fire 
regime (Whisenant 1990, Mena-
kis et al. 2003, Brooks et al. 2004). 
While disturbance due to grazing, 
development, or other anthropogenic 
causes is usually credited with driving

cheatgrass invasion (Mack 1981, 
Knapp 1996), relatively undisturbed 
sites have also been invaded (Belnap 
and Phillips 2001, Evans et al. 2001). 
Once established in an area, cheat-
grass populations are often stable and 
persistent, even if there are no further 
disturbances (Knapp 1992, Brandt 
and Rickard 1994).
In 1995, the Bureau of Land Man-
agement (BLM), in conjunction with 
Northern Arizona University and the 
Arizona Game and Fish Department, 
initiated a large-scale ecological resto-
ration project at Mount Trumbull in 
the Uinkaret Mountains in northern 
Arizona (Moore et al. 2003). In 2003, 
we observed a striking shift in the her-
baceous plant community within large 
areas of the treated landscape from a 
native perennial–dominated system 
to a cheatgrass-dominated system. No 
obvious shift in the plant commu-
nity was observed in the untreated 
landscape (Figure 1). In addition to 
the thinning and burning treatments, 
there were two important events that 
preceded this invasion: 1) in 2002, 
this region was subjected to a very 
severe drought (Figure 2) and 2) cattle 
were reintroduced to the restoration 
site after four years of exclusion from 
grazing. We propose that either or 
both of these factors, in combina-
tion with ongoing tree thinning and 
prescribed fire, were the catalysts for 
the cheatgrass invasion. In this article, 
we will present data to document the 
severity of the cheatgrass invasion in 
the ponderosa pine forests at Mount 
Trumbull and give insight into the 
causes of this invasion. Furthermore, 
we will present management recom-
mendations which may reduce the 
risk of non-native invasion on future 
ecological restoration projects. We 
begin by describing the original res-
toration project and methods we used 
to monitor the long-term changes in 
the vegetative community. We then 
discuss possible factors contributing to 
the cheatgrass invasion and conclude 
with management recommendations.

treatment unit (bottom). Note that the untreated unit is devoid of understory vegetation and 
has a high crown fire risk owing to abundant ladder fuels and interlocking canopy. In the bottom 
photo, most of the herbaceous vegetation seen is cheatgrass. While this is not atypical of the 
landscape on Mt. Trumbull, there are also areas that were not invaded or only contain a small 
population of cheatgrass. Photos courtesy of the Ecological Restoration Institute
Study Area
This study was conducted in the 
Uinkaret Mountains in northwest-
ern Arizona, in a basin between the 
Mount Trumbull and Mount Logan 
Wilderness areas (hereafter Mt. Trum-
bull), located at latitude 36°22' N and 
longitude 113°8' W. These mountains 
are sky islands of ponderosa pine forest 
and pinyon-juniper (Pinus edulis–
Juniperus spp.) woodland. They are 
surrounded by cool-desert scrub veg-
etation (sensu Welsh et al. 1993) in 
all directions except the south, which 
is bounded by the Grand Canyon. 
Mt. Trumbull is part of the Grand

Canyon/Parashant National Monu-
ment, which is managed jointly by 
the BLM and the National Park Ser-
vice. The study area is currently under 
BLM management. The elevation of 
the study site ranges from 2,000 m to 
2,250 m. The area averages 41.3 cm 
of precipitation per year, but there is 
considerable annual variation (Figure 
2). Frontal storms generate snow and 
rain in the winter, followed by a dry 
spring and early summer, with mon-
soonal rains bringing ephemeral thun-
derstorms in the mid-late summer and 
early fall. The soils on Mt. Trumbull 
were derived primarily from volcanic 
parent material. The majority of the 
study area consists of shallow, cindery 
soils of the Lozinta type.
The study area is dominated by 
ponderosa pine, though Gambel oak 
(Quercus gambelii) and New Mexico 
locust (Robinia neomexicana) are also 
major components. Dominant shrubs 
include big sagebrush (Artemisia tri-
dentata), wax currant (Ribes cereum), 
and Utah serviceberry (Amelanchier 
utahensis). The principal perennial 
grasses are muttongrass (Poa fendleri-
ana), squirreltail (Elymus elymoides), 
and western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum 
smithii). There is a highly diverse com-
munity of annual and perennial forbs. 
In addition, numerous non-native  
species are found on Mt. Trumbull.
Mt. Trumbull has been grazed by 
domestic livestock at various intensi-
ties since Euro-American settlement in 
the late 1800s. Prior to the 1960s, the 
area was heavily grazed, with annual 
forage utilization at 100%. Grazing 
was gradually reduced in subsequent 
years and there is currently a maximum 
of 88 head of cattle on our study area. 
Cattle were excluded from the study 
area upon initiation of the restoration 
treatments to minimize posttreatment 
disturbance to the vegetative commu-
nity. In August 2002, 64 head of cattle 
were reintroduced and grazed through 
October of the same year. The follow-
ing year, 76 head of cattle grazed the 
area from July through October (W. 
Bunting, BLM Arizona Strip Field 
Office, pers. comm.).
Study Design
Beginning in 1995 we established 
269 plots in a 1,500-ha area on Mt. 
Trumbull. We laid out all plots in 
a systematic grid pattern at 300-m 
intervals. Exceptions to the plot spac-
ing occurred if the plot landed on a 
road or other anthropogenic structure 
or if there was less than ten percent 
tree canopy cover on the plot. In these 
instances, we shifted the plots by 50 
meters to a more suitable location.
The plot design was modified from 
the National Park Service Fire Moni-
toring protocol (Reeberg 1995). Each 
plot was 20 × 50 m (0.1 ha) in size 
and was oriented with the long side 
running parallel with the slope of the 
terrain. We used a point line-inter-
cept method to collect cover data for 
understory plants. We took measure-
ments every 30 cm along two 50-m 
line transects laid out on the long sides 
of the plot for a total of 166 points 
per line and 332 points per plot. If 
any part of a living plant intersected 
the point, the plant was identified 
and recorded as a hit. All plants were 
included except trees taller than breast 
height (137 cm).
We determined overstory canopy 
cover using a vertical densitometer, 
with measurements taken every 3 
m along each transect for a total of 
16 points per transect or 32 points 
per plot. Canopy cover was recorded 
as either present or absent and we  
calculated a percentage for each plot.
Restoration Treatments
We thinned trees to restore pre-Euro-
American settlement (1870) stand 
density and structure (Covington et al. 
1997, Moore et al. 1999, Waltz et al. 
2003). We retained all living trees that 
germinated prior to 1870. Addition-
ally, we retained 1.5–3 replacement 
trees for every piece of remnant pre-
1870 evidence (stumps, snags, etc.). 
Details of the criteria for replacing 
remnants are described by Waltz and 
others (2003).
To protect the old growth trees from 
heat-induced cambial girdling (Sack-
ett et al. 1996), we raked forest floor 
fuels away from the boles to approxi-
mately 30 cm. Merchantable timber 
(> 12.4 cm dbh) was removed prior 
to burning slash and smaller logs left

on site. We burned treatment units 
with strip-head fire using drip torches 
for ignition. In most units the surface 
area burned completely. Fire intensity 
and severity were widely varied across 
the landscape, with some instances of 
very high fire severity. After burning, 
we seeded the treatment units with a 
mix of native plant seeds (Moore et al. 
2003, Springer and Laughlin 2004).
Thinning and burning operations 
began on the study site in 1996 and 
continued into spring 2003 (Table 1). 
One treatment unit, High Meadow, 
had been thinned but not burned 
by 2003. A single plot from Cinder 
was also thinned but not burned. For 
analyses, we included Cinder plots 
with the High Meadow unit. An addi-
tional 160 plots not included in this 
study are either scheduled for treat-
ment at a future date or located in 
the Mount Logan Wilderness. For 
logistical reasons we elected not to 
remeasure these plots in 2003. The 
remaining 4 plots were located on an 
exposed, uneroded basalt flow. Due 
to the anomalous nature of the parent 
material on these plots, we excluded 
them from the study. A 500-ha area 
was left untreated to serve as a control.
We took the majority of pretreat-
ment measurements in the summer 
of 1996, although we measured 2 
plots in October 1995 and 14 plots 
in the summer of 1997 (hereafter all 
pretreatment measurements will be 
combined into the “1996” measure-
ments). Since the plots were treated in 
different years, we took posttreatment 
measurements at several times through 
the course of this study (Table 1). We 
remeasured all treated and control 
plots in the summer of 2003. To mini-
mize seasonal differences in the vegeta-
tion, the 2003 measurements were 
timed to coincide with the original 
pretreatment measurements.
Plant nomenclature and origin fol-
lowed the USDA Plants Database 
(USDA 2004). Where possible, we 
identified all plants to the species level. 
When field identification was not reli-
able or hybridization was suspected, 
we identified the plants to the generic 
level.
Data Analysis
Our study incorporates a Before-After/
Control-Impact (BACI) design (Stew-
art-Oaten and Murdoch 1986, Green 
1993, Underwood 1994). While this 
design is not consistent with true rep-
lication and randomization (Hurlbert 
1984), it allowed us to examine eco-
system response to restoration treat-
ments across a large landscape (Van 
Mantgem et al. 2001). The treatment 
area was organized into separate land 
units based on topography and man-
agement objectives. Restoration treat-
ments were implemented based on 
the geographic boundaries of these 
management units. For the purposes 
of this study, each study plot was ana-
lyzed as an independent sample point.
We used the percent frequency of 
hits per plot as a surrogate for percent 
cover (Herrick et al. 2005). The data 
were not consistently normally distrib-
uted nor could they be made normal 
by transformation. To test for differ-
ences among years and treatments 
we used the nonparametric Kruskal-
Wallis test. Tests between individual 
years within treatment units were con-
ducted using the Wilcoxon Signed 
Ranks Test. Since means, standard 
deviations and/or standard errors are 
measures of central tendency, they 
are inappropriate for nonparametric 
analyses. Therefore, we report the 
median value (the center datum of the 
distribution) and the 25th and 75th 
percentiles (the numbers that contain 
the middle 50% of the data). The per-
centiles can be roughly equated with 
one standard deviation on a normal 
curve.
We examined relationships between 
change in cheatgrass cover and change 
in canopy cover and time since treat-
ment using a simple linear regression. 
Since the data could not be trans-
formed to meet the assumption of 
normality, the regressions are exclu-
sively for descriptive purposes. Sig-
nificances were based on α = 0.05. All 
analyses were conducted using SPSS 
software (version 12.0 for Windows, 
SPSS Inc, Chicago IL).
Results
Changes in Cheatgrass and 
Understory Vegetation
Prior to treatment, cheatgrass was a 
minor component of the understory 
vegetation. By 2003, cheatgrass cover 
had increased by more than 90-fold 
on the thinned and burned plots 
(Table 2). The cover of cheatgrass in 
2003 was significantly greater on the 
treated plots than on the controls (p < 
0.001). Significant increases in cheat-
grass were also seen in thin-only and 
control plots, but the median cover 
was at or near zero. In both of these 
treatments, the observed increases in 
cheatgrass cover occurred on plots that 
contained a well-established popula-
tion prior to initiation of this project. 
When we examined the thinned and 
burned units, we detected significant 
increases in cheatgrass in the Trick 
Tank and Rye Flat units (Figure 3). 
There was a significant year response 
in the Lava unit for cheatgrass (p < 
0.02) and native species (p < 0.01). We

3). Changes in cheatgrass cover were 
positively correlated with the number 
of growing seasons between the year 
the plot was burned and 2003 (r2 = 
0.18), but the relationship was poor. 
No correlation was detected between 
changes in cheatgrass cover and reduc-
tion in tree canopy cover (r2 = 0.01).
Native understory vegetation 
increased in the thinned and burned 
plots and significantly decreased in 
the controls between 1996 and 2003 
(Table 2). No change was detected in 
the thin-only plots. By 2003, native 
species cover was greater than that 
of cheatgrass regardless of treatment 
(Table 2). On the thinned and burned 
plots, however, cheatgrass was by far 
the most prevalent understory species. 
The most common native species were 
squirreltail, silver-leaf lupine (Lupinus 
argenteus), and New Mexico locust 
with average cover per plot of 3.5%, 
2.7%, and 2.7%, respectively. In the 
thinned and burned units, cheatgrass 
cover was 18.4% in 2003 (Table 2). 
No other non-native species increased 
significantly over this time period.
Changes in Precipitation
The year 2002 had the lowest pre-
cipitation recorded since data collec-
tion began in 1992 at the Nixon Flats 
RAWS site (Figure 2). Longer-term 
records in Arizona show 2002 to be 
the most severe drought in over a 
century (McPhee et al. 2004). Addi-
tionally, five of the eight years since 
initiation of the ecological restoration 
project have had subaverage moisture.
Discussion
Response of Cheatgrass to 
Restoration Treatments
The large-scale increase of cheatgrass 
on the Mt. Trumbull restoration proj-
ect was strongly linked to the com-
bination of thinning and prescribed 
burning in this area. Plots that were 
thinned and burned had the highest 
cover of cheatgrass when compared 
to plots that were only thinned or 
to the control plots (Table 2). While

between individual years for either 
cheatgrass or natives (Figure 3). This 
is likely a function of the low sample 
size (n = 3) and not indicative of the 
magnitude of the actual changes in 
cover. In the treatment units that we 
sampled in more than one posttreat-
ment year, the increase in cheatgrass 
was not detected until 2003 (Figure

thinning alone generated a significant 
increase in cheatgrass, cover was still 
low in 2003, and the change is an 
artifact of two anomalous plots. The 
lack of correlation between change in 
canopy cover and change in cheat-
grass cover suggests that fire was more 
important than thinning in establish-
ing the proper ecological conditions 
for cheatgrass to invade. However, in 
the absence of data from plots that 
were burned but not thinned, we 
cannot dismiss thinning disturbance 
as a factor in facilitating the invasion 
by cheatgrass. Our own observations 
of unthinned areas on Mt. Trumbull 
that were subjected to a light sur-
face fire suggest that closed-canopy 
ponderosa pine forests are resistant 
to cheatgrass encroachment. In these 
areas, cheatgrass is excluded if the tree 
canopy is intact, but dominates under 
canopy gaps caused by tree mortality.
Although there are reported cases 
of cheatgrass invading burned pon-
derosa pine forests in the Southwest, 
the results are inconsistent. In a study 
of areas in northern Arizona burned 
in wildfires, Crawford and others 
(2001) reported an increase in cheat-
grass cover from less than 0.5% in 
unburned sites to 3% in moderate 
burns and 19% in high-severity burns. 
Another study examining the response 
of understory vegetative communities 
to a wildfire in 1999 on the North 
Rim of Grand Canyon National 
Park, Arizona, (hereafter North Rim) 
found that cheatgrass was less preva-
lent within the fire’s perimeter than in 
neighboring unburned areas (Laugh-
lin et al. 2004). Crawford and Straka 
(2004) noted increases in cheatgrass 
distribution and cover over four years 
during a postfire study in burned 
areas of the Outlet Fire near Walhalla 
Plateau, North Rim, although total 
cheatgrass cover remained low.
While some studies have shown 
an increase in non-native species in 
Southwest ponderosa pine forests 
treated with prescribed fire (Sackett 
et al. 1996, Abella 2004, Korb et al. 
2004), cheatgrass is rarely cited as a 
major component of the non-native 
vegetative community. In a study in 
northern Arizona, Griffis and others 
(2001) did not detect a significant 
increase in exotic graminoids after fire, 
regardless of whether the fire was pre-
scribed or wild or in conjunction with 
thinning projects. In a ponderosa pine/
mixed conifer system on the North 
Rim, cheatgrass was found on 40% 
of plots after a prescribed burn, but 
its average relative abundance was less 
than 1% of all plants recorded (Huis-
inga et al. 2005). It is unclear whether 
the poor performance of cheatgrass 
on the North Rim was the result of 
competitive exclusion due to abundant 
native cover (ca. 50%), or if the site is 
unsuitable for cheatgrass proliferation.
The disturbances created by the 
ecological restoration project, espe-
cially prescribed burning, were the 
most important factors facilitating the 
cheatgrass invasion on Mt. Trumbull. 
Since the invasion did not occur in the 
untreated control units or the plots 
that had been thinned but not burned, 
there can be little doubt that fire was 
the essential disturbance in creating 
suitable habitat for cheatgrass. Curi-
ously, however, the timing of the inva-
sion was asynchronous with the time 
since burning. In 2003, cheatgrass 
became the dominant species in three 
treatment units: Lava, Trick Tank, and 
EB 2 & 3 (Figure 3). While the inva-
sion was a single-year event, these 
units were burned over the course of 
four years (Table 1). If prescribed fire 
is the principal mechanism driving the 
cheatgrass invasion, why then is there 
a disparity in time since burning in 
the most heavily invaded treatment 
units? Although it is common for lag 
times to occur between disturbance, 
colonization by a non-native species, 
and spread of the species (Kowarik 
1995), there is no reason for the lag 
times to vary unless there were addi-
tional causal factors. We suggest that 
the cheatgrass invasion was driven by 
the interaction of fire and thinning 
disturbances along with site-specific 
factors, such as the reintroduction of 
cattle to the study site and the severe 
drought of 2002.
Cattle Grazing
Cattle grazing has been associated 
with the spread of cheatgrass in the 
western United States (Mack 1981, 
Sparks et al. 1990, Knapp 1996). In 
recent years, however, several stud-
ies examining the influence of cattle 
grazing on non-native grasses have 
reported that grazing alone is not suf-
ficient to explain invasion (Anable et 
al. 1992, Stohlgren et al. 1999, Har-
rison et al. 2003). The reintroduc-
tion of cattle to the study site in July 
2002, shortly before the expansion 
of cheatgrass, is difficult to dismiss as 
irrelevant. By grazing on the drought-
stressed native vegetation, cattle may 
have further reduced native grass vigor 
and growth. This may have generated 
open resource niches for cheatgrass 
seedlings (Tilman 1997). Additionally, 
cheatgrass is prevalent in the lower-
elevation pastures where cattle graze 
in the early summer. Cattle may have 
transported seed from these pastures. 
Our study did not control for cattle 
grazing, so all of these comments 
remain speculative and we caution 
against overemphasizing the role of 
grazing in the cheatgrass invasion

The drought of 2002 was not only 
unique in its severity; the timing of the 
sparse precipitation was particularly 
detrimental to the native perennial 
vegetation and facilitative to the suc-
cess of cheatgrass. From August 2001 
through August 2002, Mt. Trumbull 
received only 29% of the average 
precipitation for the area (Figure 4), 
inhibiting native vegetation growth 
(Figure 3, Lava Unit). In Septem-
ber 2002 and spring 2003, the area 
received above-average precipitation, 
coincident with the timing of cheat-
grass germination and growth (Figure 
4). Cheatgrass germinates in late 
summer, overwinters as a seedling, and 
grows rapidly after snowmelt in early 
spring (Upadhyaya et al. 1986). It is 
likely that the timing of the drought 
suppressed native perennial growth in

2002, freeing up resources that cheat-
grass was able to capture before the 
native perennials could recover from 
the effects of the drought.
A similar weather pattern facilitated 
a cheatgrass invasion in Canyonlands 
National Park, Utah (Belnap and Phil-
lips 2001, Evans et al. 2001). Prior to 
fall 1994, cheatgrass was a minor com-
ponent of the vegetative community. 
After a mild, wet winter, cheatgrass 
became the dominant vegetation in 
several areas of the park, including 
areas that were subject to minimal 
disturbances.
Management Implications 
and Conclusions
The recent expansion of cheatgrass in 
higher elevations of northern Arizona 
was not isolated to the Mt. Trumbull 
region. In 2003, Mesa Verde National 
Park in southern Colorado experi-
enced a similar cheatgrass invasion 
in burned areas (Floyd et al. 2006). 
In a grazing study on Anderson 
Mesa, near Flagstaff, Arizona, cheat-
grass cover increased nearly 100-fold 
between 2002 and 2003 on both heav-
ily grazed and ungrazed plots (Loeser 
et al. 2007). Additionally, increases 
in cheatgrass have been reported in 
the 2000 Outlet Fire on the North 
Rim (Crawford and Straka 2004), and 
we observed increases of cheatgrass in 
areas of the Kaibab National Forest 
heavily impacted by recreation.
Many researchers suggest that pre-
vention and early intervention are the 
best mechanisms for reducing the risk 
of non-native plant invasions (Hobbs 
and Humphries 1995, D’Antonio and 
Meyerson 2002). The project at Mt. 
Trumbull did include some measures 
for promoting the establishment of 
native plant species. Sowing native 
seeds to the treated areas was the pri-
mary method of manipulating the 
understory vegetation. While post-
treatment seeding has been shown to 
be effective in mitigating non-native 
invasions (Bakker and Wilson 2004), 
hindsight demonstrates that this was 
insufficient to prevent cheatgrass from 
invading Mt. Trumbull. There is also 
recent evidence that weed contami-
nation of native seed mixes can be 
an important dispersal mechanism 
for cheatgrass (Keeley et al. 2006). 
Unfortunately, no proactive measures 
were taken to eradicate or contain 
cheatgrass prior to or immediately 
following treatment. The presence of 
non-natives prior to the generation 
of restoration-associated disturbances 
suggested that these areas were at risk 
for invasion.
Several researchers have discussed 
options for minimizing the risk of 
non-native plant invasions after 
disturbances (Mack et al. 2000, 
D’Antonio and Meyerson 2002, 
Harris et al. 2006). We combine their 
suggestions with our own experiences 
at Mt. Trumbull to propose the fol-
lowing recommendations for reducing 
the probability of non-native plant 
invasions on ecological restoration 
projects:
1.	Isolate areas containing non-native spe-
cies from further disturbance. Many 
non-native species are disturbance-
adapted. If there are “hot spots” of 
non-native species populations within 
or in close proximity to a project site, 
those areas should be isolated from 
further disturbance. Depending on 
site-specific logistics and manage-
ment mandates, efforts to isolate 
areas might include fire breaks, buffer 
zones excluded from restoration treat-
ments, and minimizing human and 
cattle movement across an invaded 
area to reduce seed dispersal.
2.	Reduce population size of non-natives 
prior to implementing the treat-
ments. Non-native species are often 
extremely difficult to eradicate. This 
difficulty only increases with the 
number of individuals present in 
the system. Practitioners will often 
have greater success removing the 
undesired species prior to disturbing 
the area than after an invasion has 
already occurred.

3.	Limit posttreatment seeding to areas 
already containing non-natives. Post-
fire seeding practices are coming 
under increasing scrutiny. The risk of 
contamination with non-native seeds 
is great enough that some research-
ers no longer advocate the practice. 
If unique circumstances exist that 
warrant posttreatment seeding (lack 
of native seedbank, high risk of ero-
sion, etc.), we recommend seeding 
occur only in areas already contain-
ing non-native species. The use of 
seed mixes that are certified weed-
free would negate the need for this 
recommendation.
4.	Minimize disturbance on the land-
scape. Non-native species tend to 
increase in numbers quickly after dis-
turbance. By minimizing the impact 
of disturbances associated with eco-
logical restoration, fewer open-
ings will be created for non-native  
populations to become established.
5.	Do not conduct ecological restoration 
treatments during droughts or other cli-
matic conditions that may compromise 
the success of the project. Certain cli-
matic conditions can be detrimen-
tal to post-treatment recovery of 
native vegetation. Prescribed burning 
during drought periods may induce 
elevated mortality in perennial native 
species when compared to a simi-
lar burn in a wet year. While short-
term climatic predictions are not 
always reliable, land managers should 
avoid conducting ecological restora-
tion treatments during realized or  
predicted drought periods.
6.	Conduct long-term post-treatment mon-
itoring and aggressively control non-
native population expansion. Non-
native plant species will continue to 
be a threat to the restored ecosystem 
for many years after treatment. Some 
plots in this study were not invaded 
until eight years after treatment. We 
recommend land managers monitor 
ecological restoration treatments for 
a minimum of 20 years and respond 
rapidly to any increases in non-native 
populations.
Limited resources, policy require-
ments, and the urgency to protect 
developed areas will often force land 
managers to choose a subset of these 
recommendations. Furthermore, we 
do not propose that these actions 
would completely or permanently 
eliminate non-natives from ecological 
restoration projects. Non-native plant 
species are, in all probability, going to 
be a permanent component in many 
managed ecosystems. Long-term 
maintenance of these projects will be 
necessary to prevent major shifts in 
community dominance, loss of native 
plant community components, and the 
trophic cascades that can accompany 
such losses. The recommendations we 
propose should reduce the spread of 
non-natives into ecological restoration 
projects and minimize the amount 
of posttreatment work necessary to 
keep non-natives from dominating  
the understory community.
Controlling non-native species will 
likely become increasingly difficult in 
the future. Many ecosystems world-
wide now contain established non-
native populations. Increased levels 
of disturbance from anthropogenic 
activities, coupled with uncertainties 
about the influence of global climate 
change, create a greater risk of non-
native invasion across many land-
scapes. This does not, however, mean 
that controlling non-native species is 
an impossible task. If properly con-
ducted, ecological restoration practices 
should promote ecosystems that are 
resilient to invasion (D’Antonio and 
Chambers 2006).
