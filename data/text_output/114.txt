Recently, efforts to develop multivariate models of plant species richness have been
extended to include systems where trees play important roles as overstory elements
mediating the influences of environment and disturbance on understory richness. We
used structural equation modeling to examine the relationship of understory vascular
plant species richness to understory abundance, forest structure, topographic slope, and
surface fire history in lower montane forests on the North Rim of Grand Canyon
National Park, USA based on data from eighty-two 0.1 ha plots. The questions of
primary interest in this analysis were: (1) to what degree are influences of trees on
understory richness mediated by effects on understory abundance? (2) To what degree
are influences of fire history on richness mediated by effects on trees and/or understory
abundance? (3) Can the influences of fire history on this system be related simply to
time-since-fire or are there unique influences associated with long-term fire frequency?
The results we obtained are consistent with the following inferences. First, it appears
that pine trees had a strong inhibitory effect on the abundance of understory plants,
which in turn led to lower understory species richness. Second, richness declined over
time since the last fire. This pattern appears to result from several processes, including
(1) a post-fire stimulation of germination, (2) a decline in understory abundance, and
(3) an increase over time in pine abundance (which indirectly leads to reduced richness).
Finally, once time-since-fire was statistically controlled, it was seen that areas with
higher fire frequency have lower richness than expected, which appears to result from
negative effects on understory abundance, possibly by depletions of soil nutrients from
repeated surface fire. Overall, it appears that at large temporal and spatial scales,
surface fire plays an important and complex role in structuring understory plant
communities in old-growth montane forests. These results show how multivariate
models of herbaceous richness can be expanded to apply to forested systems.

A profusion of hypotheses exist concerning specific
factors that control plant species richness (reviewed by
Grace 1999). A few of the most important factors
include primary production and competitive exclusion,
disturbance history, and the species pool. However, there
has been no resolution of the question of the relative
importance of each factor nor an adequate synthesis of
the subject (Palmer 1994, Waide et al. 1999, Gross et al.
2000, Mittlebach et al. 2001). Methods that allow for
multivariate hypothesis development and testing, speci-
fically structural equation modeling, have, in the past
few years, inspired efforts to evaluate hypotheses about
interacting networks of controlling factors (Grace and
Pugesek 1997, Gough and Grace 1999, Weiher 2003).

Such methods depend on the use of theoretically-
specified models of plausible relationships and seek to
determine which models, if any, are consistent or
inconsistent with the multivariate relations in the data
(Bollen 1989, Grace 2006). When acceptable models are
obtained, the results have the potential to indicate the
roles that different factors play in a system and the
strengths of different pathways. Such models have
provided evidence for a rich array of processes acting
to regulate species richness in herbaceous plant commu-
nities. While only a limited number of such studies have
been conducted to date, the results thus far indicate
strong influences of abiotic factors, disturbance history,
colonization, and in productive communities, competi-
tive interactions (Grace and Pugesek 1997, Gough and
Grace 1999, Grace and Jutila 1999, Grace et al. 2000).
More recently, there has been an interest in expanding
the range of factors considered in multivariate investiga-
tions of richness patterns. Grace and Guntenspergen
(1999) evaluated hypotheses about the residual influ-
ences of past disturbances (specifically, hurricanes and
tropical storms) in wetlands. Non-equilibrial processes,
such as fire, have been shown to exhibit both direct
(Weiher 2003) and indirect (Grace and Keeley 2006)
effects on diversity. Disturbance can directly affect plant
species composition through opening niches for fire-
tolerant species (Watson and Wardell-Johnson 2004) and
can indirectly affect richness through direct effects on
light availability and plant structure (Grace and Pugesek
1997). In addition, landscape influences can affect post-
fire richness patterns in chapparal (Grace and Keeley
2006). Hypotheses about the roles of historic, geo-
graphic, regional, and local factors on patterns of
endemic richness have been considered by Harrison
et al. (2006) and exemplify the capacity of multivariate
hypothesis testing to aid in the interpretation of complex
intercorrelated relationships at multiple scales.
The variety of community types considered has also
recently expanded. Weiher (2003) evaluated the multi-
variate model developed by Grace and Pugesek (1997) in
oak savannas and concluded that the inclusion of trees
creates a new set of relationships to consider in models
of richness. Further studies by Weiher et al. (2004) in
prairie containing scattered red cedar trees have pro-
vided additional support for the idea that trees can act to
both mediate and alter influences of abiotic factors on
herbaceous richness. It would seem based on the limited
information currently available that the factors influen-
cing understory richness in woodlands and forests
potentially include all those occurring in grasslands
plus the moderating and interacting effects of trees.
In this study, we extend the range of communities
considered using multivariate modeling to include old-
growth montane forests and we seek to evaluate multi-
variate hypotheses that consider the ability of trees to
moderate influences from fire history on understory
richness.
Methods
The study system
This study was conducted in old-growth montane
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson) forests
(at 22002350 m elevation) on the North Rim of Grand
Canyon National Park (GCNP), USA. Interspersed
throughout the pine forest are clumps of Gambel oak
(Quercus gambelii
Nutt.), a deciduous species that
resprouts following fire. Montane plant communities in
the southwestern United States have evolved in an
environment that experienced low-intensity surface fires
every 220 years (Swetnam and Baisan 1996, Moore et
al. 1999). However, the vast majority of montane forests
in the western United States have been affected by
commercial logging, by over-grazing from domestic
livestock (Belsky and Blumenthal 1997), and by the
exclusion of surface fires (Agee 1993). As a result, many
western montane landscapes have grown into overly
dense forests of small trees with subsequent low unders-
tory productivity and diversity. In contrast, Grand
Canyon National Park (GCNP) contains the largest
never-harvested, minimally grazed, and naturally burned
(Fule´ et al. 2003) forest ecosystem in Arizona. As a
result, these relict sites are rare examples of western
forest landscapes close to the historic range of natural
variability (Fule´ et al. 2002). As such, they offer a place
to consider how plant community structure is related to
abiotic and biotic factors under conditions of minimal
anthropogenic disturbance.
Laughlin et al. (2005) used model selection to
determine the best fitting multiple regression model to
explain variation in species richness in a broad span of
montane forests. Understory abundance and species
richness was negatively correlated with the number
of years since the last surface fire (hereafter, ‘time-
since-fire’) and pine abundance (Laughlin et al. 2005).
Fire is known to affect forest structure (Agee 1993), and
pine abundance is well known to negatively impact
understory
production
(Moore
and
Deiter
1992)
through competition for light, water and soil nutrients
(McLaughlin 1978, Riegel et al. 1995). However, multi-
ple regression does not allow the researcher to interpret
why predictor variables, such as pine abundance and
time-since-fire, were correlated (Grace and Bollen 2005).
It is likely that time-since-fire directly affects pine
abundance, which in turn directly affects understory
plant abundance; hence, in this study we use a structural
equation modeling approach to test a variety of theore-
tically-specified multivariate models having compound
pathways.

Sampling methods
We sampled understory and overstory characteristics on
eighty-two 0.1 ha plots. The plots were separated by at
least 300 m and arranged on a grid across the landscape
(i.e. plots were located at intersections of lines on a grid;
see Fule´ et al. (2002) and Laughlin et al. (2005) for study
site figures). Plots were oriented uphill-downhill and
percent slope for each plot was determined using
clinometer
readings. Understory
plant communities
were sampled using belt and point intercept transects
that were 50 m in length with points every 30 cm
(Laughlin et al. 2005). Understory vegetation was
dominated by C3 graminoids and annual and perennial
forbs; few shrubs were detected (Laughlin et al. 2005).
Species richness was determined as the number of
vascular plant species below breast height that occurred
within the 0.1 ha plot. Percent foliar cover was calcu-
lated by dividing the number of points containing a plant
along the point intercept transect divided by the total
number of points (/332). Trees greater than 15 cm
diameter at breast height (dbh) were measured on the
entire plot and trees between 2.5 and 15 cm dbh were
measured on one quarter-plot; all diameters and species
of trees were recorded (Fule´ et al. 2002).
Previous studies of fire effects on understory vegeta-
tion have noted potential confounding effects of time-
since-fire and fire frequency, and have therefore held one
variable constant to study the effects of the other (Fox
and Fox 1986) or have taken a multivariate approach
(Weiher et al. 2004, Watson and Wardell-Johnson 2004).
We
estimated time-since-fire for each plot in the
montane forests with two complimentary sources: fire
perimeter maps and interpolation of fire scar data
(Farris et al. 2004, Laughlin et al. 2005). We also
estimated fire frequency since 1880, which is the date
of region-wide fire exclusion corresponding to the arrival
of Euroamericans (Fule´ et al. 2003), by counting the
number of fires that overlaid each plot. This method was
quite conservative since we only included fires that
scarred at least 10% of the recording trees and fire
maps derived from fire scars can underestimate fire size.
Multivariate hypotheses
The general hypotheses of interest in this paper are
presented in Fig. 1. This model represents an expansion
of the one presented by Grace and Pugesek (1997) with
the inclusion of overstory abundance as an important
element. All of the hypotheses represented are based on
what we believe to be a plausible set of assumptions that
include, (1) that current forest overstory abundance may
be influenced by past disturbance events and abiotic
gradients, (2) that the abundance of understory plants
may be influenced by overstory abundance, disturbance
events, and abiotic gradients, and (3) that understory
richness may respond to all four of the other system
properties. We recognize that it cannot be guaranteed
that the causal relations implied by these assumptions
fully represent all the processes operating in this system.
Indeed, potentially important abiotic gradients, such as
soil properties (which were not measured), are missing
from the model. Rather, through the analyses in this
paper we seek to determine whether the relations in the
data are consistent with expectations from any of the
multivariate hypotheses considered (Bollen 1989).
All the hypotheses represented by Fig. 1 seek to
determine if understory richness relates in some way to
disturbance (specifically, fire) history in this system.
There is also interest in seeing what role gradients in
topographic slope play in this system. Further, we have
an interest in evaluating hypotheses about moderating or
altering effects of trees and understory abundance on
understory richness. By ‘moderating’ we refer to the
degree to which a presumed effect of fire history or
topographic slope on understory richness can be ex-
plained by an intervening effect on either forest overs-
tory
or
understory
abundance.
For
example,
if
understory abundance completely moderates the effects
of disturbance history and forest overstory on richness,
all compound pathways would go through understory
abundance and no other pathways would go directly to
richness. By ‘altering’ we refer to the situation where the
presence of information about intervening variables (in
this case, overstory and understory abundance) alters
our view of the effects of an influencing factor (fire
history or slope) on a response (understory richness).
Both kinds of relations are of interest in models that
imply a cascading chain of influences, as in Fig. 1.
A number of initial expectations are represented in
Fig. 1 and are based on previous studies of this system
(Crawford et al. 2001, Gildar et al. 2004, Laughlin et al.
2004, 2005, Huisinga et al. in press). First, it is expected
that forest overstory density varies as a function of fire

history. The relations can be potentially complex de-
pending on the effects of fires on seedlings and saplings,
the effects on canopy tree growth, and the absolute
frequency of fires. Generally, fires in this system, though
frequent prior to 1880, occurred only 05 times per plot
since 1880, and none were stand-replacing. This means
that relations of tree abundance to components of fire
history (time-since-fire or fire frequency) might be either
positive or negative. Second, it is strongly expected that
low understory abundance will be associated with high
abundance of ponderosa pine, the dominant tree in this
system. Finally, it is expected that where conditions are
unfavorable for abundant understory growth, there will
be a low level of species richness due to a lack of
opportunities for establishment. It is also possible that
richness is reduced somewhat where understory growth
is very high, though it is not clear whether understory
abundance in this system is sufficient to drive a loss of
species.
What is less certain for this system is whether
overstory and understory abundance completely moder-
ate effects of fire history. It is quite possible that there are
influences of forest overstory on richness that either
intensify or ameliorate the influences of fire history. It is
also possible that fire history has had influences on
understory richness that are unrelated to overstory or
understory abundance. The same questions can be asked
about topographic slope. These less certain pathways,
arrows denoted by the letters a and b, represent
alternative models of a priori interest. These alternatives
will be considered in both specific models (presented
later in the paper) representing relations among the
measured properties of the system and in general models
of the form in Fig. 1.
Data analyses
Prior to evaluations of multivariate hypotheses, bivariate
examinations of relationships among variables were
examined. All relationships were considered for the
presence of outliers, evidence of skewness or kurtosis,
and nonlinear relations. A log transform of understory
plant cover was used to linearize relations with richness;
all other variables were analyzed in their native scale.
Spatial autocorrelation in richness was also examined to
determine whether there might be contagion in the data
(Laughlin et al. 2005). Results found no evidence of
autocorrelation; therefore, the data were analyzed as
independent samples without modeling proximity.
Structural equation modeling
Two types of structural equation models were analyzed
in this study: ‘specific’ and ‘general’ models. ‘Specific’
models were evaluated to give a detailed perspective of
relationships. Figure 2 represents the a priori specific
model evaluated. In this model, the abundance of
Gambel oak was separated from the abundance of
ponderosa
pine
because
of
the
potential
unique
effects each species may have on understory vegetation
(Laughlin et al. 2005). In addition, two components of
fire history were represented separately, time-since-fire
and the frequency of fires during the past 118 years.
Time-since-fire and fire frequency covary in the model
since plots that burned recently tended to have burned
frequently as well (Fule´ et al. 2003, Laughlin et al. 2005).
Because oak abundance varied with topographic slope,
this landscape feature was included in the specific model.
The models in this paper were formulated using latent
variables (in circles) and single indicators (observed
variables represented by rectangles). Two possible in-
dicators were considered for both oak abundance and
pine abundance, total basal area (m2 ha1) and tree
density (trees ha1). Ponderosa pine, which was the
dominant canopy species in the great majority of plots,
showed much stronger relationships to all other variables
when expressed as total basal area compared to when
expressed as tree density. This is understandable given
the fact that these trees grow to a large size in low-
density stands in these forests. Gambel oak, in contrast,
showed stronger relationships to other variables when
expressed as tree density. This species is one that
resprouts, often forming dense thickets, but which does
not often grow into stands of large trees in these forests.
Another reason for using oak density rather than oak
basal area as an indicator of oak abundance is because
we have observed that understory plants can be abun-
dant beneath single large oaks, but not beneath dense
oak thickets; in contrast, plant abundance is often low
beneath single large pines and beneath dense pine
thickets.

We considered whether estimates of indicator relia-
bility (repeatability) should be used to specify the degree
of measurement error in the model. This was done
because appropriate assignments of measurement error
can reduce bias in path coefficients (Bollen 1989, Grace
2006), and because we were fairly confident that some of
the indicators were not measured perfectly (and, there-
fore, without error). Indications of the degree of repeat-
ability (reliability) were obtained by correlating readings
taken in different years. Such readings provided an
underestimate of reliability because they incorporated
both measurement error and temporal variation. Still,
reliabilities estimated in this way were generally high (up
to 90%). Because only approximate measures of relia-
bility could be obtained, conservative estimates of
percent error were used in the analyses. Based on our
scientific judgement, experience, and available data, we
assigned values of 10% error to the indicators of fire
frequency and understory richness, 5% to understory
abundance and time-since-fire, and 0% to pine abun-
dance, oak abundance, and slope. The effects of relia-
bility estimates on the stability of model results were
explored by rerunning the final model using higher or
lower reliabilities. For comparison, runs were made using
zero estimates for measurement error (equivalent to an
observed variable model analysis) and using values
double those specified.
We used a competing models approach to compare
models of initial interest. The structural relationships
(pathways involving latent variables) shown in Fig. 2
describe one of the hypotheses of initial interest, which
we refer to as the ‘indirect effects’ hypothesis. In this
hypothesis, all effects of slope, fire, and trees on
understory richness can be explained by their effects
on understory abundance. The model included both
first- and second-order polynomial terms for oak density
to allow for nonlinear relations between this and other
variables (initial examination of the data indicated that
the bivariate relation between oak density and both
richness and plant cover fit a second-order polynomial).
Though included in the model, we do not illustrate these
non-linear relations in the final model for simplicity.
Alternative models to the one shown in Fig. 2 that
were investigated were those with direct paths to
understory richness from variables other than unders-
tory abundance. Analyses proceeded by comparing
competing models using chi-square difference tests,
without reference to modification indices. The best
model selected using this procedure was further exam-
ined for indications of lack of fit using residual
covariances and modification indices, as well as by
examining the significance of pathways. Analyses were
performed using the program Mplus (Muthe´n and
Muthe´n 2005) and normal theory maximum likelihood
estimation.
The second type of structural equation model exam-
ined in this study was a ‘general’ model. These models
are of the form in Fig. 1 and include composite variables
in which combinations of effects are aggregated so we
can address more general hypotheses. The effects of
time-since-fire and fire frequency were combined into
effects of disturbance. Also, the effects of oak and pine
were combined into an estimate of the effects of
overstory
abundance.
Composite
variable
modeling
was performed based on the principles in Heise (1972)
using the procedures developed by Grace and Bollen
(described in Grace 2006, Ch. 6). These procedures use a
two-stage approach in which models are estimated
without composites in the first stage. In the second
stage, composites are included with zero error variance
and with one incoming path fixed to a value of 1 so as to
set the scale for the composites.
Results
Understory richness was significantly correlated (PB/
0.01) with all six of the observed variables in the model
(Fig. 3). Richness fit a curvilinear relation to total
understory cover (Fig. 3a). Visual examination indicated
that richness leveled off when total cover was approxi-
mately 5060%. A clear drop in richness at the highest
values of cover was not observed in these data, however.
For the purposes of modeling a linear relation with
richness, a log transformation of cover yielded a linear
graph and a correlation of 0.70. Richness declined
linearly with increasing pine basal area (Fig. 3b). Oak
density fit a second-order polynomial relation with
richness, with richness declining where oak density
exceeded approximately 1500 trees ha1 (Fig. 3c). Posi-
tive linear relations to richness were found for slope and
fire frequency, and a negative linear relation to richness
was found for time-since-fire (Fig. 3de). Correlations
among all variables are given in Table 1.
Analysis of specific structural equation models found
that the indirect effects model, which includes only those
paths shown in Fig. 2, was not consistent with the data
(x2/21.8, 9 df, P/0.01; indicating significant differ-
ences between model and data). The first alternative
model (developed from theoretical justifications) in-
cluded a direct path from time-since-fire to understory
richness and yielded a chi-square of 8.80 (8 df, P/0.36).
The drop in chi-square of 13.0 was highly significant
(PB/0.01), indicating this model was more appropriate.
The second alternative model included a direct path
from fire frequency to understory richness and yielded a
chi-square of 6.6 (7 df, P/0.47). This decline in chi-
square was not significant, indicating this path should
not be included in the model. Inclusion of a direct path
from slope to understory richness likewise failed to
improve model fit significantly. Thus, the first alternative
64
OIKOS 114:1 (2006)

model was deemed the best of those initially considered.
Examination of residuals and modification indices did
not reveal substantial discrepancies. However, signifi-
cance tests for pathways revealed that the paths from the
fire variables to oak abundance were not significant,
therefore, we decided to delete these from the final
model. These deletions permitted estimates of separate
effects between oak abundance and pine abundance
(instead of a single net relationship) because the result-
ing model could be ‘identified’ (i.e. unique estimates of
all parameters were possible).
The final model (Fig. 4) fit the data well (x2/11.7,
9 df, P/0.23), indicating that the covariance structure
of the data did not significantly deviate from the
covariance structure implied by the model. The final
model
explained
the
majority
of
total
variance
in
understory
richness
(R2/0.64)
and
understory
abundance (R2/0.72), but explained less of the total
variance of oak abundance (R2/0.21) and pine abun-
dance (R2/0.22). Standardized path coefficients for this
model are shown in Fig. 4 and the prediction equations
that include unstandardized coefficients are provided in
Table 2.
The results of our sensitivity analyses showed that
model fit was not significantly affected by varying the
amount of measurement error (Table 3). Both the model
without measurement error and the model with double
the estimated measurement error fit the data. Also,

results supported retention of all the same pathways,
thus, model structure was stable. As expected, the
magnitude of certain pathways was found to be sensitive
to variations in specified measurement error. Most
responsive were the paths from time-since-fire to un-
derstory abundance and to pine abundance. The paths
from fire frequency to pine abundance and to understory
abundance were also moderately responsive. All other
path coefficients were relatively unresponsive to varia-
tions in measurement error.
Indirect relations contribute to the so-called ‘total
effects’, which represent the sum of direct and indirect
pathways (Table 4). Results indicate that for most
variables, their relationships with understory richness
were entirely indirect. The one exception was time-since-
fire, which contributed directly to the explanation of
variation in understory richness. Even for time-since-fire,
though, the majority of its total effect on understory
richness (/0.84) was indirect (/0.46), through relation-
ships with pine and understory abundance.
The analysis of the general model in which some
effects were composited produced a broader perspective
of relationships (Fig. 5). The general model had a chi-
square of 13.0 (10 df, P/0.23). The structure of this
model fit with the findings for specific models, in that
there was evidence for a direct path from disturbance
history to understory richness and no support for a
direct path from overstory abundance.
Discussion
Partitioning direct and indirect effects on community
structure has advanced the understanding of patterns of
diversity across landscapes. In old-growth montane
forests that are evolutionarily adapted to a surface fire
regime, the evidence from this analysis suggests that
understory richness is influenced by direct and indirect
effects of fire history. Indirect effects of fire history on
understory richness are apparently mediated through
direct effects on pine abundance and understory abun-
dance. Therefore, over large temporal and spatial scales,
surface fire plays an important role in structuring
understory plant communities in old-growth montane
forests.
Understory plant abundance was not found to be
unimodally related to understory richness in this study,
though a leveling off of richness did occur where plant
cover was high. This may indicate that competitive
exclusion limits seedling establishment and persistence
at high levels of understory plant abundance (Grime
1979).
The observation that understory richness was lower
where overstory abundance was higher can be explained
entirely by the fact that understory abundance was low
where overstory abundance was high. Thus, we found no
evidence of unique effects of forest structure on richness.
This contrasts with Weiher’s (2003) finding that tree

canopy had a direct effect on richness, yet virtually no
effect on herbaceous biomass. In this system, pine trees
intercept light (Naumburg and DeWald 1999), intercept
precipitation (McLaughlin 1978), produce abundant
needle-fall, and can compete for soil nutrients, all of
which can negatively impact herbaceous productivity.
Riegel et al. (1995) concluded that limiting resources
such as light, water, and nutrients affected understory
species composition in ponderosa pine forests based on
individual species responses’ to resource manipulation.
It would seem that ponderosa pine has a strong influence
on the understory plant community. Furthermore, our
evidence implies that pine abundance may have a slight
negative effect on oak abundance, likely due to resource
competition, but oak abundance had no detectable
reciprocal effect on pine abundance in this case.
Oak abundance was positively related to topographic
slope in this system. This result may be specific to North
Rim forests, as Gambel oak can readily grow on flat
terrain in other pine forests in northern Arizona. Oak
abundance was unimodally related to understory abun-
dance (data not shown). Low to moderate densities of
oak trees had a positive association with understory
production, which may be mediated by oak litter, as oak
positively influences soil fertility (Klemmedson 1987,
1991). Soil nutrient content, which was not measured in
this study, may have contributed to unexplained variance
in the model (Grace et al. 2000, Weiher 2003, Weiher
et al. 2004). However, understory abundance began to
decline as oak densities surpassed 1500 trees ha1.
Therefore, the positive path (0.28) should be interpreted
as showing that intermediate levels of oak are associated
with maximum understory abundance. This result clari-
fies the relationship found in Laughlin et al. (2005),
where pine-oak forests had much greater plant cover and
slightly greater plant species richness than pure ponder-
osa pine forests, and agrees with Weiher (2003) who
found weak positive effects on a variety of plant species
when oak canopy was moderate.
Time-since-fire appears to have a strong negative total
effect on understory richness (/0.84) in this system,
with some of the influence mediated by positive influ-
ences on overstory abundance, some mediated by
negative
influences
on
understory
abundance,
and
some of the influence represented by a negative direct
path. Several different processes would seem to be
operating here. The strong positive association between
time-since-fire
and
pine
abundance
exists
because
pine abundance increases during long, fire-free intervals
(/100 years in some cases). Long-term absence of fire

mature trees and thereby contribute to larger stand
volumes. In contrast, the strong negative direct path
from
time-since-fire
to
understory abundance
may
represent post-fire stimulation of herbaceous primary
production, either through the release of nutrients into
the soil (Covington and Sackett 1992), or a reduction of
built-up plant litter on the soil surface. Thus, forests
without fire show a decline in understory abundance
above and beyond what can be explained simply by
increases in pine abundance. These processes ultimately
resulted in a loss of approximately one plant species per
0.1 ha per decade (Fig. 3) when fire is excluded from
these forests.
The direct path from time-since-fire to understory
richness implies an effect that is independent of overs-
tory or understory abundance. We think it is possible
that this represents post-fire stimulation of richness,
either by creating previously unavailable habitat, or by
stimulating fire-tolerant and fire-dependent species. Low
intensity fires can produce high amounts of small-scale
heterogeneity, since slight variability in fuel load and
moisture can determine whether an area will burn or not
(Huston 1994, Bond and van Wilgen 1996). This
heterogeneity can potentially create opportunities for
fire-tolerant
species
(Watson
and
Wardell-Johnson
2004), allowing for the coexistence of numerous species.
Heat and smoke from fires can also stimulate germina-
tion of understory species (Keeley 1991). For example,
germination of Penstemon barbatus, a native forb,
increased dramatically after exposure to smoke (Abella
2005). This may be another important mechanism of
post-fire stimulation of plant richness that has been little
studied in this system. Furthermore, the increased
availability of light to the soil surface following a burn
allows for the germination of annual species (Grime
1977, Gibson 1988). Pine forests that have not burned
for over 70 years had significantly fewer annual species
than forests that burned recently (Laughlin et al. 2005),
and annual species responded positively to a low-
intensity fire on the North Rim of GCNP (Laughlin et
al. 2004).
The implied effects of fire frequency are perhaps the
most counterintuitive results in the model. The bivariate
relationships between fire frequency and understory
abundance and richness (Table 1) were significant and
positive (r/0.23, 0.44, respectively). However, once
time-since-fire was statistically controlled, model results
implied that areas with more frequent fires have lower
richness than otherwise expected. In other words, these
results suggest that if we could hold time-since-fire
constant for all plots, we would see that those plots
with high fire frequencies have comparatively low
richness. This appears to result primarily from a positive
association between frequent fires and pine abundance
and
negative
association
between
frequent
fires
and understory abundance. We interpret the positive
association with pine abundance as an indication that
multiple fires have a thinning effect on pine seedlings and
saplings, thereby allowing the old-growth pine trees to
grow larger faster and contribute to greater stand
volumes (Feeney et al. 1998). We interpret the negative
association of frequent fires with understory abundance
as an indication that multiple fires can harm understory
production, possibly by depletion of soil N after
repeated exposure to surface fire (Binkley et al. 1992,
Wright and Hart 1997). Because of the counterintuitive
nature of the results and the fact that fire frequency was
very conservatively measured, we consider paths from
fire frequency as tentative until later confirmed in
subsequent multivariate studies. However, these results
exemplify the strength of structural equation modeling
as a tool for analyzing complex relationships among
many variables, since traditional univariate techniques
could not have detected these residual effects (Grace and
Pugesek 1997, 1998). In other studies, herbaceous
species richness has been found to be negatively related
to fire frequency in tallgrass prairie (Collins et al. 1995),
but positively related to fire frequency in loblolly pine
forests (Lewis and Harshbarger 1976, Waldrop et al.
1987). Based on the limited data available at present, it
appears that fire frequency may not have a consistent
relationship to richness across systems.
General theories about disturbance and species diver-
sity are well supported in surface fire-adapted montane
forests. Moderate disturbance frequencies increase di-
versity by reducing rates of competitive displacement,
but high frequencies can reduce diversity through direct
species loss. In montane systems, fire history is clearly a
strong influence on plant species richness, but the
structural equation model results suggests that there is
a delicate balance between time-since-fire and fire
frequency and that some of these effects are mediated
through overstoryunderstory interactions.
These data and analyses also suggest that multivariate
models of richness, such as those used to understand
patterns in herbaceous communities (Grace and Pugesek
1997, Gough and Grace 1999, Grace and Jutila 1999,
Grace et al. 2000), can be expanded to incorporate the
mediating effects of the forest overstory (Fig. 5). It
would seem that in general, forest overstories can,
among other things, reduce understory abundance and
the importance of competition among herbaceous spe-
cies in regulating richness. At the same time, while not
found in this study, there are other cases where the
overstory has been found to have unique influences on
understory richness (Weiher 2003), which remain to be
explored fully. In this case, the overstory completely
moderated the effects of abiotic gradients on understory
abundance. Disturbance, on the other hand, had unique
influences on both understory abundance and richness,
representing cumulative effects of fire history.

This example contributes to a growing body of
literature indicating that abiotic and biotic factors and
their complex interactions are important in regulating
spatial and temporal variation in plant species richness
across landscapes. Structural equation models, while
often reflecting specific influences in each system stu-
died, appear to be consistent with a general multivariate
model in which variations in disturbance, abiotic condi-
tions, overstory, and understory conditions combine to
explain broad patterns of plant species richness. Further
studies, including both a greater range of conditions and
those that seek to test model predictions, either experi-
mentally or with additional observational data, should
provide additional insight into the adequacy of this
model to represent diversity regulation in fire-adapted
forest systems.
