ABSTRACT
Aim Our objectives were to compare understorey plant community structure
among forest types, and to test hypotheses relating understorey community
structure within lower montane and subalpine forests to ﬁre history, forest
structure, fuel loads and topography.
Location Forests on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona,
USA.
Methods We measured understorey (< 1.4 m) plant community structure in
0.1-ha plots. We examined differences in univariate response variables among
forest types, used permutational manova to assess compositional differences
between forest types, and used indicator species analysis to identify species
driving the differences between forest types. We then compiled sets of proposed
models for predicting plant community structure, and used Akaike’s information
criterion (AICC) to determine the support for each model. Model averaging was
used to make multi-model inferences if no single model was supported.
Results Within the lower montane zone, pine–oak forests had greater
understorey plant cover, richness and diversity than pure stands of ponderosa
pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson var. scopulorum Engelm.). Plant cover
was negatively related to time since ﬁre and to ponderosa pine basal area, and was
highest on northern slopes and where Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.) was
present. Species richness was negatively related to time since ﬁre and to
ponderosa pine basal area, and was highest on southern slopes and where Gambel
oak was present. Annual forb species richness was negatively related to time since
ﬁre. Community composition was related to time since ﬁre, pine and oak basal
area, and topography. Within subalpine forests, plant cover was negatively related
to subalpine ﬁr basal area and amounts of coarse woody debris (CWD), and
positively related to Engelmann spruce basal area. Species richness was negatively
related to subalpine ﬁr basal area and amounts of CWD, was positively related to
Engelmann spruce basal area, and was highest on southern slopes. Community
composition was related to spruce, ﬁr and aspen basal areas, amounts of CWD,
and topography.
Main conclusions In montane forests, low-intensity surface ﬁre is an important
ecological process that maintains understorey communities within the range of
natural variability and appears to promote landscape heterogeneity. The presence
of Gambel oak was positively associated with high ﬂoristic diversity. Therefore
management that encourages lightning-initiated wildﬁres and Gambel oak
production
may
promote
ﬂoristic
diversity.
In
subalpine
forests,
warm
southern slopes and areas with low amounts of subalpine ﬁr and CWD were
positively associated with high ﬂoristic diversity. Therefore the reduction of CWD
and forest densities through managed wildﬁre may promote ﬂoristic diversity,
although ﬁre use in subalpine forests is inherently more difﬁcult due to intense
ﬁre behaviour in dense spruce–ﬁr forests.

INTRODUCTION
Management of montane and subalpine forests requires an
understanding of the range of natural variability of understo-
rey plant community structure. ‘Natural variability’ is the
range of ecological conditions found in intact systems, and in
North America is often regarded as the range of conditions
within the ecosystem prior to Euro-American settlement
(Landres et al., 1999). Various approaches have been used to
quantify the natural variability of tree species in south-western
forests, in particular, dendrochronological methods have been
used to determine overstorey reference conditions (Fule´ et al.,
1997; Mast et al., 1999). However, less information is available
concerning the range of natural variability of understorey plant
communities.
One useful approach used to examine the variability of
understorey communities has been to measure relict sites that
have been relatively undisturbed since Euro-American settle-
ment (Gildar et al., 2004). Unfortunately, the vast majority of
upland forests in the western USA have been affected by
commercial logging, overgrazing by domestic livestock (Belsky
& Blumenthal, 1997), and the exclusion of surface ﬁres (Agee,
1993). However, Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP) contains
the largest unharvested (Warren et al., 1982), minimally grazed,
and occasionally burned (Fule´ et al., 2003a) forest ecosystem in
Arizona, and therefore provides valuable sites for measuring
natural variability. We focused our study on lower montane and
subalpine forests (sensu Marr, 1961; Brown & Lowe, 1980). The
lower montane zone (2200–2350 m, hereafter ‘montane’) is
dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson
var. scopulorum Engelm.) and Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii
Nutt.) forest. The upper montane zone (2350–2600 m) consists
of dense ponderosapine andmixed conifer forests that have been
heavily invaded by shade-tolerant and ﬁre-intolerant trees such
as white ﬁr [Abies concolor (Gord. & Glend.) Lindl. ex Hildebr.]
(Fule´ et al., 2004; Mast and Wolf, 2004); the plant community
structure within this zone was examined by Huisinga et al.
(2005) and was not included in this analysis. The subalpine zone
(2600–2900 m) is a diverse mixture of Engelmann spruce (Picea
engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.), subalpine ﬁr [Abies lasiocarpa
(Hook.) Nutt.], aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and mixed
conifer forests with ponderosa pine on southern slopes.
Natural variability of understorey plant community struc-
ture is determined by complex interactions of biotic and
abiotic factors. Our use of the phrase ‘plant community
structure’ is inclusive, including plant species composition,
richness and abundance (Tilman, 1982; Krebs, 1994). In
upland forest ecosystems of western North America, it has
been proposed that understorey plant community assemblages
are strongly inﬂuenced by ﬁre (Crawford et al., 2001; Scho-
ennagel et al., 2004), forest structure and tree species compo-
sition (Naumburg & DeWald, 1999; Chipman & Johnson,
2002), fuel load (Laughlin et al., 2004) and topography (Zobel
et al., 1976).
Montane forest communities in the south west have evolved
in an environment that historically burned every 2–20 years by
low-intensity surface ﬁres (Swetnam & Baisan, 1996; Moore
et al., 1999). Dendrochronological analyses of our study sites
have not detected any stand-replacing ﬁres in the montane
zone before Euro-American settlement (Fule´ et al., 2003a),
although stand-replacing ﬁres appear to have occurred in
northern Rocky Mountain ponderosa pine forests (Ehle &
Baker, 2003; Pierce et al., 2004). Subalpine plant communities
in North America are adapted to an evolutionary environment
characterized by short growing seasons and a disturbance
regime of infrequent, high-intensity crown ﬁres (Agee, 1993;
Kipfmueller & Baker, 2000; Johnson et al., 2001; Fule´ et al.,
2003b). In both systems, ﬁre has strong direct effects on
understorey plant community structure by altering site con-
ditions and microclimate. Fire also affects forest structure and
fuel loads which, in turn, may directly inﬂuence the under-
storey plant community.
Plant community structure may be indirectly related to ﬁre
history through the effect of ﬁre on forest structure: established
overstorey trees outcompete many herbaceous species for
resources (Riegel et al., 1995). In montane and subalpine
systems, plant production and species richness are generally
positively related to light availability mediated through abun-
dances of conifer and hardwood tree species (Daubenmire,
1943; Oosting & Reed, 1952; Ellison, 1954; Langenheim, 1962;
Fonda & Bliss, 1969; Reynolds, 1969; Despain, 1973; Ffolliott,
1983; Tapia et al., 1990; Stromberg & Patten, 1991; Moore &
Deiter, 1992; Reich et al., 2001). It has been shown that species
richness is higher in conifer stands with greater light availab-
ility (Chipman & Johnson, 2002); plant production in aspen
forests decreases as conifer abundance increases; and clear-
cutting spruce–ﬁr stands in Colorado increases forage pro-
duction (Kranz & Linder, 1973; Regelin and Wallmo, 1978;
Mueggler, 1985). Hardwood species, such as aspen and
Gambel oak, might have a positive effect on herbaceous
plant communities relative to conifers by increasing litter
quality through greater litterfall nitrogen (Daubenmire, 1953;
Klemmedson, 1987, 1991; Reich et al., 2001), and by changing
the quality of light in the understorey.
Plant community structure may also be indirectly related to
ﬁre history through ﬁre’s reducing effects on fuel loads.
Accumulated litter can intercept light, alter soil microclimates,
form physical barriers to plant emergence (Facelli & Pickett,

1991), and affect germination (Sydes & Grime, 1981). Previous
studies on the North Rim of GCNP have demonstrated that
recently burned montane forests have shallower duff layers
(semi-decomposed leaf litter) and greater understorey species
richness than ﬁre-excluded forests (Gildar et al., 2004; Laugh-
lin et al., 2004; Huisinga et al., 2005). Subalpine forests are
known for an abundance of large coarse woody debris (CWD)
(Langenheim, 1962; Despain, 1973; Crouch, 1985), which can
also inﬂuence patterns of understorey vegetation.
Topography can affect community structure in the region
because of increased insolation on southern slopes and
prolonged snow packs on northern slopes (Fonda & Bliss,
1969; Kuramoto & Bliss, 1970; Douglas, 1972; Canaday &
Fonda, 1974; Anderson et al., 1979). Increased insolation on
southern exposures raises soil temperatures and evaporation
rates, and reduces the duration of the winter snow pack
(Patten, 1963). The shorter growing season in areas of deep
snow may be the most critical environmental factor affected by
snow cover (Knight et al., 1977). Subalpine plants commonly
wilt at midday or while affected by sunﬂecks in response to
increased insolation and water stress (Young & Smith, 1979;
Smith, 1981). Plant community composition was related to
moisture gradients in the Sangre de Cristo Range, Colorado,
USA (Allen & Peet, 1989), and also in short-grass prairie,
Canada (Lieffers & Larkin-Lieffers, 1986). These studies
suggest that moisture availability mediated by topographic
position can inﬂuence understorey plant community structure
across many ecosystems.
Our objective was to identify the combination of these biotic
and abiotic variables that provides the best model to explain
variation in understorey plant community structure within
montane and subalpine forests. Determining the best set of
explanatory variables to make robust predictions about the
structure of plant communities has been a central theme in
ecology for decades. The traditional approach has been to test
null hypotheses with normal theory-based statistics such as the
F test; but F tests have been shown to select simpler models
even when more complex ones were more appropriate (Ludden
et al., 1994). Model-selection techniques grounded in likelihood
theory, such as Akaike’s information criterion (AICC), are
increasingly being used in ecology to draw inferences from a set
of competing hypotheses (Johnson & Omland, 2004). Model
selection simultaneously confronts several competing hypoth-
eses with data, and is used to identify a single best model or, if

there is no single best model, to make inferences based on
weighted support from several competing models (Burnham &
Anderson, 2002). We used the literature and theory to develop
sets of models explaining understorey plant community
structure, and used AIC to determine which model or
combination of models was best supported by our data.
STUDY AREA
The study sites are located on the North Rim of GCNP
(Fig. 1), at the southern extent of the Kaibab Plateau, a dome-
shaped land form with gradual relief and complex drainage
(Merkle, 1962). Plot locations spanned an elevational gradient
from 2200 to 2800 m, and contained a range of slopes, aspects
and forest types. The montane forests are dominated by
P. ponderosa and Q. gambelii. Montane forest understoreys on
the North Rim are composed primarily of C3 grasses such as
Poa fendleriana (Steud.) Vasey and Elymus elymoides (Raf.)
Swezey, unlike other ponderosa pine forests of northern
Arizona, which are more often dominated by C4 grasses such
as Bouteloua spp. and Muhlenbergia spp. (Arnold, 1950).
Therefore montane forests on the North Rim may be
ﬂoristically more similar to Rocky Mountain lower montane
forests, which are slightly cooler and wetter than other south-
western pine forests.
The subalpine forests are dominated by Engelmann spruce,
subalpine ﬁr, quaking aspen, white ﬁr and Douglas ﬁr
[Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco]. Subalpine forest
understoreys in Arizona differ ﬂoristically from those in the
Rocky Mountains and the Paciﬁc Northwest, particularly due
to the absence of Vaccinium spp. and bryophytes (Dauben-
mire, 1943; Patten, 1963; Fonda & Bliss, 1969; Despain, 1973),
and the occurrence of ponderosa pine on southern slopes
(Rasmussen, 1941). We refer to this zone as ‘subalpine’
because it is dominated by spruce–ﬁr forests, although we
acknowledge that high-elevation forests on the Kaibab Plateau
differ somewhat from those in other subalpine areas in the
western USA (Rasmussen, 1941; Merkle, 1954, 1962).
Soils on the North Rim have been tentatively classiﬁed as
Typic Paleustalfs (A. Dewall, National Resource Conservation
Service, pers. comm.) derived from Kaibab limestone. The
56-year average annual precipitation at the North Rim ranger
station (elevation 2564 m) is 647 mm; much of this total
precipitation falls as snow in the winter months, with an
average annual snowfall of 3560 mm. Precipitation is generally
lower in the montane zone and higher in the subalpine zone;
Pearson (1931) estimated that Arizona ponderosa pine forests
receive 540 mm and spruce–ﬁr forests 870 mm precipitation
annually. Temperatures range from an average July maximum
of 25.1 C to an average January minimum of )8.2 C
(Western Regional Climate Center, http://www.wrcc.dri.edu).
The North Rim of GCNP provides valuable sites for
studying plant community reference conditions. Limited
livestock grazing occurred on the Kaibab Plateau as early as
1871 (Woodbury, 1944) and signiﬁcant cattle grazing occurred
by 1885 (Rasmussen, 1941), but cattle and sheep grazing
essentially ceased in GCNP in the mid-1930s, when a fence was
built along the boundary to exclude domestic animals. This
fence still excludes most domestic livestock, although occa-
sionally animals trespass into GCNP where downed logs have
damaged the fence. In addition, remote lower montane forests
on the North Rim of GCNP have had relatively uninterrupted
ﬁre regimes (Fule´ et al., 2002, 2003a,b) because it was difﬁcult
for ﬁreﬁghters to access remote areas in the early 1900s.
Moreover, GCNP advocates the restoration of ecological
processes, and therefore has allowed lightning-initiated ﬁres
to burn since the 1980s. As a result, these relict sites are rare
examples of western forest landscapes close to the range of
natural variability (Fule´ et al., 2002). As such, they offer a place
to test hypotheses about how plant community structure is
related to biotic and abiotic factors under conditions of
minimal anthropogenic disturbance.
Fire-scar analyses indicate that montane forests burned
frequently before 1880 (6–9-year mean ﬁre return interval; Fule´
et al., 2003a). Around 1880, when Euro-American settlement
began, the frequent surface-ﬁre regime in south-western pine
forests was disrupted by overgrazing and a successful ﬁre-
suppression policy. Post-1880, landscape-scale surface ﬁres are
therefore relatively rare events in south-western forests. Several
landscape-scale surface ﬁres occurred after 1880 in lower
montane forests on the North Rim (Table 1; Fule´ et al., 2003a).
Many ﬁres occurred on Powell and Rainbow Plateaus, a few

occurred on Fire Point, and no ﬁres occurred on Galahad Point
(Fig. 1; Table 1). The Galahad Point and Fire Point sites are
more accessible to ﬁre crews, which is probably why they have
burned less frequently and longer ago than the more remote
Powell and Rainbow Plateaus (Fig. 1). Inclusion of all sites in
the analysis was important to assess the effects of a variable ﬁre
regime on the understorey community.
The subalpine forests at Little Park (Fig. 1) historically had a
mixed-severity ﬁre regime, which consisted of a mixture of
low-intensity surface ﬁres on warm, southern slopes (31-year
mean ﬁre return interval) and infrequent, patchy, stand-
replacing ﬁres (currently 120–230 years since the last ﬁre)
(Fule´ et al., 2003b). No signiﬁcant ﬁres have occurred at Little
Park since 1879 (Table 1). However, the absence of ﬁre since
1879 at high elevation is not entirely out of the historical range
of variability, since these forests typically experience long
intervals between ﬁres (Agee, 1993). Approximately 60% of the
forest at Little Park originated from stand-replacing ﬁre (Fule´
et al., 2003b).
METHODS
Data collection
Permanent
plots based on the
National Park
Service’s
ﬁre-monitoring protocol (NPS, 1992; Reeberg, 1995) were
established in the study area to examine forest structure,
composition and ﬁre histories across the elevation gradient.
Each plot was classiﬁed according to forest type (see below)
and elevation zone (montane or subalpine). Plots were located
on a 300-m grid in the montane zone and a 600 · 1200-m grid
in the subalpine zone. The wider grid spacing in the subalpine
zone was used to capture the landscape-level heterogeneity of a
mixed-severity ﬁre regime (Fule´ et al., 2003a,b). Analyses with
Moran’s I (unpublished) found no evidence for spatial
autocorrelation among understorey variables, so plots were
considered independent of each other. Each plot was 0.1 ha
(20 · 50 m) in size and oriented with the 50-m sides uphill–
downhill to maximize sampling variability along the elevation
gradient. Forest structure-sampling methods and results were
reported by Fule´ et al. (2002, 2003b).
We sampled understorey plant cover, species richness and
species composition in the summers of 1998–2001. Understorey
plant communities were sampled using belt- and point-inter-
cept transects. Complete species lists were made of all vascular
plants (forbs, grasses, sedges, shrubs, and young trees below
breast height, < 1.4 m) and ferns within two 10 · 50-m belt
transects per plot. Each species found in the study area occurred
on zero, one, or two belt transects per plot; these data were used
for the analysis of community composition and the assessment
of relative abundance. We lumped species to the generic level
when vegetative characteristics were insufﬁcient to warrant
identiﬁcation to species. For example, ‘Chenopodium spp.’
includes Chenopodium fremontii, Chenopodium berlanderii, and
possibly others. Nomenclature follows USDA NRCS (2004).
Species were classiﬁed into ﬁve functional groups: annual forbs
(including biennial forbs); perennial forbs (including one fern
species); graminoids; shrubs; and trees. We did not sample
bryophytes since they are poorly represented in south-western
subalpine forests. Understorey species richness did not vary in
correspondence with year of sampling, indicating that differ-
ences detected between zones or forest types were not due to
inter-annual climatic differences or sampling effects.
A 50-m point-intercept transect was established in the centre
of each belt transect, and the presence of vascular plants and
trees below breast height was recorded at a point every 30 cm
along each transect. A plant was recorded if any part of its
living biomass occurred on a point along the line. We summed
the data from the two transects per plot, yielding a total of
332 points per plot. Percentage foliar cover was calculated by
dividing the number of points containing a plant by the
332 points per plot.
Forest ﬂoor characteristics, including duff (Oe + a horizons;
semi-decomposed leaf litter) and CWD were measured on four
permanent 15.24-m planar transects per plot, using the
method outlined by Brown (1974) and Sackett (1980). The
duff layer comprised the combined fermentation and humus
layers located between the litter layer and mineral soil (Brown,
1974). Rotten and sound CWD were combined in this analysis,
and included downed logs > 7.62 cm in diameter. We
recorded the diameter and length of downed logs to estimate
the mass of CWD in Mg ha)1.
Topography was measured using an index of moisture
availability (IMA) calculated for each plot as:
IMA ¼ cosðaspect  45Þ  slope category
where the following slope categories were used: 0 (< 1%),
1 (1–7%), 2 (8–15%), 3 (16–25%), 4 (> 25%). These
categories were adapted from those of Batek et al. (1999) to
ﬁt the steeper western terrain. Therefore the index ranges from
)4 (xeric, steep, south-facing slopes) to + 4 (mesic, north-
facing slopes). This classiﬁcation provides an index of moisture
availability as inﬂuenced by drainage and exposure.
Time since ﬁre
A wealth of ﬁre history information was available for our
montane study sites; ﬁre history was not examined for
subalpine forests because probably none has burned since
1879 (Fule´ et al., 2003b). We estimated the number of years
since the last surface ﬁre (hereafter, ‘time since ﬁre’) for each
plot in the montane forests using two complementary sources:
ﬁre perimeter maps and interpolation of ﬁre scar data. Fire
perimeter maps were obtained from the National Park Service
and included ﬁres since the 1980s. Long-term ﬁre histories of
the study sites by Fule´ et al. (2003a,b) included ﬁre events
since the 1700s. Plots at Powell and Rainbow Plateaus last
burned 5–11 years before sampling; plots at Fire Point,
75–119 years before sampling; and plots at Galahad Point,
122 years before sampling (Table 1).
To interpolate ﬁre scar data, we mapped the locations of all
sampled trees in a GIS (arcview 3.3; ESRI, 2002). The areal

extents of ﬁres recorded by at least 10% of the trees sampled
were estimated using Thiessen polygons (Farris et al., 2004).
This
method
requires
virtually
no
parameterization
or
assumptions, and closely resembles approaches used in the
ﬁre history literature (Farris et al., 2004). Time since ﬁre was
determined by overlaying the plots on the ﬁre polygons. Plots
located within the perimeters of multiple ﬁres were assigned
the date of the most recent ﬁre. This approach to mapping ﬁres
has limitations and cannot directly estimate time since ﬁre, so
the uncertainty about our estimates added error to the models.
However, Farris et al. (2004) found a strong spatial correlation
(81%) between ground-surveyed ﬁre perimeters and Theissen
polygons generated from ﬁre-scarred trees in a southern
Arizona forest. Most of the error in their study was due to
underestimation of actual ﬁre size, so our estimates for time
since ﬁre could be high.
Previous studies of ﬁre effects on understorey vegetation
have noted potential confounding effects of time since ﬁre and
ﬁre frequency, and have therefore held one variable constant to
study the effects of the other (Fox & Fox, 1986), or have taken
a multivariate approach (Watson & Wardell-Johnson, 2004).
In our study, ﬁre frequency and time since ﬁre were highly
correlated: sites that have burned recently have also burned
frequently, and vice versa (Table 1). We chose to use time since
ﬁre, instead of ﬁre frequency, for this analysis as the data
resolution per plot was higher for time since ﬁre.
Forest type
In companion studies of forest structure (Fule´ et al., 2002,
2003b), plots were classiﬁed into four forest types (ponderosa
pine, mixed conifer, aspen and spruce–ﬁr) on the basis of their
overstorey importance values, which had been calculated as the
sum of relative frequency (stem density) and relative abundance
(basal area) (Taylor, 2000). For example, a plot was considered
an aspen plot if aspen had the highest importance value of all tree
species on that plot, even if there was a large conifer component.
Therefore ponderosa pine forest was dominated by ponderosa
pine; mixed conifer forest by Douglas-ﬁr and white ﬁr; aspen
forest by aspen; and spruce–ﬁr forest by Engelmann spruce and
subalpine ﬁr. Picea pungens Engelm. (blue spruce) was grouped
with P. engelmanii due to identiﬁcation difﬁculties (Fule´ et al.,
2003b). We further subdivided plots in the ponderosa pine forest
type into ‘pine–oak’ forest if a plot contained Gambel oak, and
into ‘ponderosa pine’ forest if it did not contain oak (Table 1). In
total, therefore, we recognized ﬁve forest types for this analysis:
pine–oak, ponderosa pine, mixed conifer, aspen and spruce–ﬁr.
Univariate analyses comparing forest types were carried out
on nine plant community structural characteristics: total species
richness (number of species per 0.1 ha); species richness in each
of ﬁve functional groups (annual forbs, perennial forbs,
graminoids, shrubs, trees); total exotic species richness; plant
cover (%); plant diversity (Shannon’s H¢). Comparisons of
univariate community characteristics between forest types were
made with Kruskal–Wallis H tests (a ¼ 0.05) as data did not
meet assumptions of normality or equal variances. Signiﬁcant
results were followed by post hoc multiple comparisons made
with Bonferroni-adjusted Mann–Whitney U tests.
Multivariate analyses
We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordi-
nations to illustrate compositional differences in understorey
vegetation among plots across the study area. Ordination of
species composition was conducted using pc-ord software (ver.
4.25; McCune & Mefford, 1999). NMDS arranges the plots in a
conﬁguration that minimizes the inter-plot distances (stress).
We used the Bray–Curtis distance measure (Faith et al., 1987)
with random starting conﬁgurations, 100 runs with real data, a
maximum of 400 iterations per run, and a stability criterion of
0.00001. A Monte Carlo test with 9999 randomizations was used
to determine how likely the observed stress value of the ﬁnal
solution would be by chance alone. Species that occurred on
< 5% of the plots were omitted from the ordination and from
analyses of species composition, but were included in univariate
analyses of species richness (following McCune & Grace, 2002).
Comparisons of species composition among forest types
within elevation zones were made with permutational manova
using distlm5 software (Anderson, 2005). This software
permits the analysis of multivariate data with any distance
measure and linear model, and can handle unbalanced designs.
The calculated statistic is termed a ‘pseudo-F’ and is calculated,
like a traditional F statistic, as the sum of the squared distances
among groups divided by the sum of the squared distances
within groups (for details see Anderson, 2001; McArdle &
Anderson, 2001). Data were untransformed and unstandar-
dized. Dissimilarities were calculated using the Bray–Curtis
distance measure. If differences were detected between groups,
pairwise comparisons were made with a pseudo-t statistic
(Anderson, 2001). P values were calculated by permuting the
observations 9999 times, so no assumptions regarding the
distributional form of the data were required.
The indicator species analysis (ISA) routine in pc-ord was
used to explain the results of the permutational manova by
determining which species were most abundant and most
frequent within the deﬁned groups. Groups were deﬁned based
on results of the permutational manova. In particular, forest
types that did not differ in community composition were
grouped together for the ISA. This method allowed us to detect
which species differed between elevation zones, and which
drove the statistical differences between forest types. An
indicator value (INDVAL) is the product of the relative
abundance (calculated by species presence on number of belts
per plot) and relative frequency (calculated by species presence
on number of plots) of a species (Dufreˆne & Legendre, 1997).
INDVAL was calculated for each species in each grouping
(between elevation zones and among forest types within each
zone). Species were considered to be indicators of the group in
which they had the largest INDVAL. Indicator species had to
have P < 0.05 (assessed using Monte Carlo randomizations
with 999 permutations) and INDVAL > 25 (Dufreˆne &
Legendre, 1997). An INDVAL of 25 would occur, for example,

if a species occurred on 50% of the plots in a group and had a
relative abundance of at least 50% in that group.
Model selection
The ﬁrst step in model selection is the articulation of several
biologically plausible models (Johnson & Omland, 2004). Each
model is composed of a response variable (e.g. plant cover), a
list of predictor variables (e.g. time since ﬁre), and the
postulated sign of the relationship between each predictor and
the response (Tables 3 & 4). We used 10 plant community
structural characteristics as response variables: total species
richness; species richness in each of ﬁve functional groups
(annual forbs, perennial forbs, graminoids, shrubs, trees); total
exotic species richness; plant cover; plant diversity; understorey
community composition. We followed USDA NRCS (2004) to
classify plant species as exotic or non-native in North America.
Explicit mathematical models of plant community structure
in these ecosystems were uncommon in the literature, but
general hypotheses or statements about how plant communities
are structured were abundant. We included a hypothesis for
testing if: (1) a signiﬁcant relationship between predictor vari-
ables and a response variable of interest in this study was pre-
sented in the literature, or (2) a general statement was proposed
in the literature about how communities were structured. An
example of the ﬁrst type is ‘the number of herbaceous species was
inversely related to the percent cover of evergreen trees and
shrubs in the community (R2 ¼ 0.38)’ (Zobel et al., 1976,
p. 151). Examples of the second type, which were much more
common, include ‘there is usually a luxuriant herbaceous growth
under the aspen’ (Patten, 1963, p. 380), or the ‘herbaceous
understorey in spruce–ﬁr stands is very sparse’ (Ellison, 1954,
p. 174). In some cases we created combinations from simpler
models, and some models were used to test response variables
beyond those originally speciﬁed. We restricted our attention to
models with no more than four independent variables so that
models could be applied practically by other researchers. The
predictor variables used are listed in Table 2, and the sets of
models and their sources are listed in Tables 3 and 4 for the
montane and subalpine zones, respectively.
For univariate response variables we used jmp-in 5.1.2
software (SAS Institute, 2004) to obtain residual sums of
squares for each model tested. For understorey community
composition, we used distance-based multivariate multiple
regression (McArdle & Anderson, 2001; see Anderson et al.,
2004 for another example of this procedure) via distlm5 to
obtain residual sums of squares for each model tested.
For each response variable, we calculated AICC for each
model in the set (Tables 3 and 4). The AICC value for each
model in the set was rescaled to Di by subtracting the AICC of
the model with the smallest AICC. The resulting Di values were
then converted to Akaike weights (wi) as:
wi ¼
exp  1
2 Di


PR
r¼1 exp 1
2 Di


where R is the number of models in the set (for details see
Burnham & Anderson, 2002). The wi of the models in a set
sum to 1; each wi can be interpreted as the probability that it is
the best model in the set.
If no single model was overwhelmingly supported by the
data (wi > 0.95), we used model averaging to make multi-
model inferences (Burnham & Anderson, 2002). Model
averaging entails calculating a weighted average of parameter
estimates (^h),
^h ¼
X
wi ^hi
where ^hi is the parameter estimate from the ith model. In these
cases we ordered the models from highest to lowest wi and
made inferences on the subset of models where Rwi > 0.95.
Results were very similar if we used this subset of models or the
full set of models (data not shown).

predictor and dropped it from the model. Adjusted coefﬁcients
of determinism (adj-R2) for the ﬁnal models were determined
by calculating the residual sums of squares using the parameter
estimates calculated via model averaging. All adj-R2 calculated
for the ﬁnal models were within 6% of the adj-R2 as calculated
with least squares for the model containing those explanatory
variables.
RESULTS
Forest types across both zones
Pine–oak forests had the highest understorey plant cover of any
forest type on the North Rim (Fig. 2). Understorey plant cover
was 66% greater and species richness 16% greater in pine–oak
than in ponderosa pine forests. The higher cover in pine–oak

forests was not due to oak, as plant cover remained higher if oak
cover was excluded from the comparison. Shannon’s index (H¢)
of diversity was highest in pine–oak, aspen and mixed conifer
forests, and total species richness of the understorey was highest
in pine–oak, aspen and spruce–ﬁr forests. Annual forb species
richness was highest in pine–oak and ponderosa pine forests;
annuals were nearly absent from aspen, mixed conifer and
spruce–ﬁr forests. Perennial forb species richness was highest in
pine–oak forests and lowest in aspen and spruce–ﬁr forests.
Graminoid species richness did not vary among forest types.
Shrub richness was greatest in pine–oak forests, while under-
storey tree species richness was greatest in aspen, mixed conifer
and spruce–ﬁr forests. Exotic species richness was highest in
pine–oak and ponderosa pine forests (Fig. 2).

Univariate plant community structure response variables
The best-ﬁtting subset of models explained 58% of the
variation in plant cover and 43% of the variation in total
species richness (Table 5). Species richness of several func-
tional groups was very poorly explained by these models
(adj-R2 < 0.10). As predicted (Table 3), time since ﬁre and
ponderosa pine basal area were negatively correlated with
response
variables
(Table 5;

predicted that positive IMA values would be positively corre-
lated with response variables, and this was true for plant cover
and diversity, but not for species richness (Table 5).
Community composition among forest types
We identiﬁed 134 species across the montane zone. The NMDS
analysis of understorey community composition focused on
the 86 species found on at least 5% of the plots. Thirty-ﬁve
species were signiﬁcant indicators (INDVAL > 25) of montane
forests (Table 6).
Understorey
community
composition
differed
signiﬁ-
cantly between pine–oak and ponderosa pine forest types
(pseudo-F ¼ 4.9, P ¼ 0.0001), and this variation is illustrated
in the NMDS ordination (Fig. 4). Mahonia repens, Solidago
velutina and Collinsia parviﬂora were indicators of pine–oak
forest, and P. ponderosa seedlings were an indicator of ponderosa
pine forest (Table 6).
Models predicting that community composition was signi-
ﬁcantly correlated with ﬁre history, forest structure and
topography (Table 3) were supported. Time since ﬁre, basal
areas of pine and oak, and IMA explained 22% (adj-R2) of the
total variation in species composition (Table 5). Individually,
time since ﬁre and oak basal area explained the most variation
(16% and 4%, respectively).

variation in total understorey species richness for the subalpine
zone (Table 7). Species richness of several functional groups
was very poorly explained by these models (adj-R2 < 0.10). As
predicted, subalpine ﬁr basal area was negatively correlated
with
understorey
plant
cover,
richness
and
diversity.
Engelmann spruce basal area was correlated with the response
variables, but unexpectedly the sign of the relationship was
positive. Duff depth was negatively correlated with plant cover,
and the amount of CWD was negatively correlated with plant
cover and richness, but not diversity (H¢). Southern exposures,
as indicated by their IMA values, were associated with high
species richness, particularly of perennial forbs (Table 7).

*Linear models can be derived from the table, which lists the coefﬁcients for each explanatory variable that contributed to the full model. For example,
the equation for plant cover is as follows:
Plant cover (%) ¼ 56.6 ) 0.222(time since ﬁre) ) 0.644(pine basal area) + 2.756(oak basal area) + 1.082(IMA).
Models for tree, shrub, exotic, and graminoid species richness are not shown since they explained < 10% of the variation.
These variables explained variation in species composition, but we do not report their coefﬁcients because there is no clear interpretation with a
multivariate response. Community composition (a multivariate metric) was scaled using multivariate multiple regression in Anderson (2005).

Community composition among forest types
We identiﬁed 120 species in the understorey across the
subalpine zone. The analysis of community composition
focused on the 70 species found on at least 5% of the plots.
Twenty-two species were signiﬁcant indicators (INDVAL > 25)
of subalpine forests (Table 5).
Understorey community composition differed between
forest types within the subalpine zone (pseudo-F ¼ 2.2,
P ¼ 0.004), and is illustrated in the NMDS ordination
(Fig. 4). Spruce–ﬁr forests differed in composition from all
other forest types (ponderosa pine, pseudo-t ¼ 1.6, P ¼ 0.026;
mixed conifer, pseudo-t ¼ 1.9, P ¼ 0.005; aspen, pseudo-
t ¼ 1.5, P ¼ 0.039), but other forest types did not differ in
composition (all pseudo-t < 1.1, P > 0.350). Arenaria fendleri,
Penstemon virgatus, Hymenoxys subintegra, P. menziesii, Muh-
lenbergia montana, Potentilla hippiana and Androscae septen-
trionalis were indicators of spruce–ﬁr forest, and Penstemon
barbatus and Corallorhiza maculata were indicators of non-
spruce–ﬁr forest (aspen, mixed conifer and ponderosa pine
forests combined; Table 5).
Models predicting that community composition should be
related
to
forest
structure,
fuel
load
and
topography
(Table 4) were supported. Basal areas of Engelmann spruce,
subalpine ﬁr and aspen, CWD and IMA explained 18%
(adj-R2)
of
the
total
variation
in
species
composition
(Table 7). Individually, Engelmann spruce basal area and
amount of CWD explained the most variation (9% and 7%,
respectively).
DISCUSSION

Plant community structure in Grand Canyon forests
Journal of Biogeography 32, 2083–2102, ª 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd
2095

herbaceous diversity in south-western ponderosa pine forests
is maintained by frequent, low-intensity ﬁres which reduce
pine densities and fuel loads. This was also supported by
other studies on the North Rim (Gildar et al., 2004; Laughlin
et al., 2004). Elsewhere in North America, an interaction
between time since ﬁre and canopy cover (an interaction
term in a multiple regression model), interpreted as an
indicator of light availability, was negatively correlated with
species richness in mixed wood boreal forests (Chipman &
Johnson, 2002). Similarly, in an ecosystem where stand-
replacing crown ﬁres are typical in Yellowstone National
Park, Wyoming, high total plant cover and species richness
were correlated with shorter ﬁre intervals (Schoennagel et al.,
2004). Our results also agree with studies in the woodland
ﬂora of Australia (Morrison et al., 1996; Watson & Wardell-
Johnson, 2004) that found time since ﬁre to be correlated
with community composition.
Time since ﬁre may also be important for preserving
landscape-scale heterogeneity with respect to plant community
structure. The variability in plant cover and annual forb
richness is much greater on sites that have burned recently and
frequently (Fig. 3) than on sites that have not burned for over
60 years. However, variability in total species richness and in
perennial forb richness was not noticeably greater in recently
burned forests than in ﬁre-excluded forests. Apparently, plant
cover and annual species are more sensitive than total species
richness and perennial forb richness to variations in conditions
created by ﬁre.
Our results agree with previous studies that have shown high
ponderosa pine abundance to depress understorey plant
production (Ffolliott, 1983; Tapia et al., 1990; Moore &
Deiter, 1992) since pine trees create deep shade, intercept
precipitation and compete for soil resources (McLaughlin,
1978; Riegel et al., 1995; Naumburg & DeWald, 1999). Pine
abundance was also related to variation in species composi-
tion, suggesting that differences in forest structure could cause
changes in ﬂoristic assemblages.
The positive correlations between oak basal area and
understorey plant cover and richness are not well understood.
Gambel oak has been shown to be valuable to breeding birds
and small mammals in ponderosa pine forests (Reynolds et al.,
1970; Rosenstock, 1998). Interestingly, our study suggests that

*Linear models can be derived from the table, which lists the coefﬁcients for each explanatory variable that contributed to the full model. For example,
the equation for plant cover is as follows:
Plant cover (%) ¼ 23.7 + 0.704(spruce basal area) ) 0.504(subalpine ﬁr basal area) ) 0.089(duff) ) 0.077(CWD).
Models for tree, shrub, annual and exotic richness are not shown as they explained < 10% of the variation.
These variables explained variation in species composition, but we do not report their coefﬁcients because there is no clear interpretation with a
multivariate response. Community composition (a multivariate metric) was scaled using multivariate multiple regression by Anderson (2005).

there is a positive relationship between plant abundance and
the presence of oak in montane forests. This effect may be
mediated by oak litter, as oak positively inﬂuences soil fertility
(Klemmedson, 1987, 1991). This relationship might also be a
function of the quality and quantity of light beneath the
broadleaved oaks; further research is warranted.
Our results indicate that the cooler, wetter northern slopes
of montane forests can produce more understorey vegetation
per unit area (cover), but the warmer, drier southern slopes
accommodate more species. Our ﬁndings agree with a study of
coniferous forests in the western Cascades of Oregon, USA
where herbaceous richness was highest on drier sites, but
herbaceous cover was highest on cooler, wetter sites (Zobel
et al., 1976). In contrast, species diversity was highest on
northern slopes in short-grass prairie (Lieffers & Larkin-
Lieffers, 1986).
Subalpine zone
Many studies have suggested a positive relationship between
aspen abundance and understorey production and species
richness (Langenheim, 1962; Fonda & Bliss, 1969; Despain,
1973; Mueggler, 1985; Stromberg & Patten, 1991; Brown, 1994;
Reich et al., 2001), probably due to superior litter quality
(Daubenmire, 1943) and greater litterfall nitrogen (Reich
et al., 2001) in aspen stands. However, this study did not
conﬁrm that relationship. This discrepancy may be a result of
our gridded sampling scheme, which did not intentionally
target pure aspen stands (see Methods). Many aspen stands on
the North Rim have not burned for over 100 years and
therefore contain numerous conifers. Conifer densities in
aspen stands might explain why aspen and mixed conifer forest
understorey compositions were indistinguishable. Elsewhere in
northern Arizona, aspen forests had the highest plant cover
among many forest types, but had relatively low species
richness (Fisher & Fule´, 2004; S. Abella, Northern Arizona
University, pers. comm.). Aspen stands in northern Arizona
had high plant cover values, indicating high herbaceous
production, but unlike other regions they had relatively low
species richness.
Many researchers have suggested that plant cover and
species richness would be negatively related to conifer abun-
dance, as the sparse herbaceous layer in spruce–ﬁr forests is
often attributed to dense canopies and thick litter layers
(Ellison, 1954; Patten, 1963; Zobel et al., 1976; Stromberg &
Patten, 1991). Our study conﬁrms this relationship for
subalpine ﬁr, probably due to the deep shade and acidic litter
underneath ﬁr trees. Spruce and ﬁr abundance explained some
variation in community composition in our study, but clear-
cutting spruce–ﬁr stands did not signiﬁcantly change plant
community composition in Colorado (Crouch, 1985).
Given
the
general
agreement
that
conifer
abundance
decreases understorey plant production, it was surprising
that understorey plant cover, richness and diversity were
positively correlated with Engelmann spruce abundance. This
result disagrees with every model proposed about plant
community structure in spruce–ﬁr forests (Table 4). Subalp-
ine forests on the Kaibab Plateau differ from most North
American subalpine communities in that a greater proportion
of other conifer species (e.g. Douglas-ﬁr, ponderosa pine) are
present on southern slopes. Perhaps this combination of
overstorey trees and their interactions in this subalpine
environment caused this unusual observation; this discrep-
ancy deserves further study and should be considered a
tentative result.
We have observed that species richness is often higher on
plots that were located in close proximity to mountain
meadows (data not shown). Similarly, Fonda & Bliss (1969)
observed that plots within a subalpine ﬁr forest contained
more species if they were closer to the openings in the forest.
Merkle (1962) reported generally high total herbaceous plant
cover (34–45%) in meadows (or ‘parks’) on the Kaibab
Plateau, and noted differences in species composition between
meadows and forests. Despain (1973) also noted a distinct
difference in composition between meadows and forests in the
Big Horn Mountains, Wyoming.
Large volumes of CWD are commonly found in spruce–ﬁr
forests (Langenheim, 1962; Despain, 1973; Crouch, 1985),
increasing with time since ﬁre (Agee, 2002). Crown ﬁres can
drastically reduce overstorey and understorey cover in subalp-
ine forests, but understorey cover can return to unburned
levels within 3 years (Turner et al., 1999). Perhaps plant cover
and diversity in these communities gradually decline as CWD
accumulates,
tree
densities
increase,
and
availability
of
resources such as light or space declines. This would suggest
that understorey diversity is highest following crown ﬁres.
Plant cover and species richness were positively correlated with
short ﬁre intervals in subalpine forests in Yellowstone National
Park (Schoennagel et al., 2004), although this result contrasted
with studies from other ecosystems subject to crown ﬁres
(Paine et al., 1998).
Topography was correlated with understorey species rich-
ness, diversity and community composition, but was not
related to plant cover. Warmer, southern exposures harboured
more species than cooler, northern exposures. Snow-pack
location is strongly correlated with topography (Billings,
1973), and the persistence of winter snow pack strongly
inﬂuences plant community structure in subalpine forests
(Fonda & Bliss, 1969; Kuramoto & Bliss, 1970; Douglas, 1972;
Canaday & Fonda, 1974; Knight et al., 1977; Anderson et al.,
1979). Although we did not measure snow pack on these sites,
the Kaibab Plateau receives an average of 3.56 m snow each
winter, and snow depths of 1–3 m have been recorded
(Merkle, 1962). The inﬂuence of snow pack on vegetation in
other subalpine ecosystems in North America suggests that it
plays an equally important role in structuring Arizona
subalpine ecosystems.
Comparison of montane and subalpine zones
Montane and subalpine plant communities are deﬁned by
elevation zone (Lo¨ve, 1970; MacMahon & Anderson, 1982;
Plant community structure in Grand Canyon forests
Journal of Biogeography 32, 2083–2102, ª 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd
2097

Peet, 2000). Differing climates and ﬁre regimes are perhaps the
strongest abiotic inﬂuences on plants within these zones. In
contrast to the subalpine zone, the montane zone is low
enough in elevation that it is not affected by prolonged snow
packs during the growing season (Fonda & Bliss, 1969; Knight
et al., 1977), which could explain why diversity is higher on
north slopes in the montane zone, yet lower on north slopes in
the subalpine zone. Also, the frequent ﬁre regime in montane
forests could be a stronger adaptive force than the mixed-
severity ﬁre regime of subalpine forests (patchy, stand-
replacing with some surface ﬁres; see Fule´ et al., 2003b), as it
is a more regular and common disturbance.
Annual forb species richness was greatest in montane forests
and was negatively correlated with time since ﬁre. Annual forbs
are common in montane forests following disturbances such as
wildﬁre (Gibson, 1988; Huston, 1994; Crawford et al., 2001;
Laughlin et al., 2004; Huisinga et al., 2005), which agrees with
Grime’s (1977) hypothesis that annual species are more
abundant on frequently disturbed sites. However, annual forbs
were rare in the subalpine zone (Fig. 2), perhaps because it has
not burned since at least 1879. An alternative hypothesis is that
annual forbs are naturally absent in high-elevation spruce–ﬁr
forests, although Went (1953) documented at least 40 annual
plants at high elevations in the Sierra Nevada, California, and
Schoennagel et al. (2004) detected many annual plants in
subalpine forests that had short ﬁre intervals.
Management implications
The long-term protection of these forests from logging, grazing
and complete ﬁre suppression has allowed these sites to
maintain key elements of ‘wildness’ (Fule´ et al., 2002). Our
consideration of these forests as relict sites is supported by the
low abundance of exotic species on the North Rim (Fig. 2), in
contrast to studies at another high-elevation site in Arizona
(Fisher & Fule´, 2004), and outside the park boundary in the
Kaibab National Forest (Crawford et al., 2001). Similar results
of low exotic abundance in remote forests of Yellowstone
National Park were reported by Turner et al. (1999) and
Schoennagel et al. (2004), which led them to suggest that
seeding or other management activities to reduce the spread of
exotics were not justiﬁed in remote, protected landscapes.
However, continued monitoring of exotic species on the North
Rim, especially after wildﬁres, remains justiﬁed and important.
In montane forests, low-intensity wildﬁre is an important
ecological process that maintains understorey communities
within the range of natural variability and may promote
landscape heterogeneity. Crown ﬁres may have occurred in
central and northern USA ponderosa pine forests (Ehle &
Baker, 2003), especially during warmer climate intervals (Pierce
et al., 2004), but evidence of crown ﬁres in south-western
ponderosa pine forests prior to Euro-American settlement has
not been reported (Swetnam & Baisan, 1996; Fule´ et al., 2003a).
Community composition was shifted toward higher similarity
with reference sites after a managed wildﬁre on Fire Point
(Laughlin et al., 2004), and plant diversity was highest on sites
that have burned frequently and recently in this study. The
preservation of key ecosystem processes, most importantly
lightning-initiated wildﬁre, is an important component of
ecological restoration of south-western ponderosa pine forests
(Allen et al., 2002). Therefore we recommend the continued use
of wildﬁre and prescribed ﬁre as management tools in North
Rim montane forests. Moreover, based on the positive associ-
ations of oak with wildlife and plant diversity, we suggest
maintaining various growth forms of Gambel oak within south-
western montane forests through no-cutting policies.
The subalpine forests have not burned for over 120 years,
which is not out of the historical range of variability. Subalpine
forests across North America have stand-replacing crown-ﬁre
regimes, although some surface ﬁres burned in North Rim
subalpine forests due to the drier and more open south slopes
(Fule´ et al., 2003b). Stand-replacing ﬁres are an important
ecological process in the subalpine zone (Johnson et al., 2001)
and should be incorporated into management plans. However,
ﬁre use in subalpine forests is fraught with risks due to intense
ﬁre behaviour in dense spruce–ﬁr stands, so it is inherently
more difﬁcult to preserve these high-energy ecological proces-
ses due to dangers and to public perception of denuded post-
ﬁre landscapes. Stand-replacing or mixed-severity ﬁres could
initiate the development of pure aspen stands or open conifer
stands, which could also promote understorey productivity. In
short, we recommend ﬁre use in any ecosystem where ﬁre has
played an ecologically important role historically, but acknow-
ledge that ﬁre use in subalpine ecosystems is inherently more
difﬁcult than in montane ecosystems.
To conclude, despite the insights gained through this study,
much of the natural variability in these ecosystems was not
accounted for in our models. No model explained more than
60% of the variation in plant community structure within the
montane zone, or more than 35% of the variation within the
subalpine zone, indicating that additional factors are structur-
ing these communities. Potential factors that were not
explored in this study include native ungulate herbivory
(Huffman & Moore, 2003) and soil nutrient resources (Grace
et al., 2000; Weiher et al., 2004). Nonetheless, the models that
we used demonstrate that some of the variability in understo-
rey plant community structure in these forests is explained by
ﬁre history, forest structure, fuel loads and topography. The
ranges of variability reported here (Tables 2 & 6; Fig. 2 & 4)
and by Fule´ et al. (2002, 2003a,b) can be used as benchmarks
for assessing future change (Landres et al., 1999) and to
determine whether current management practices result in
ecosystems that fall within the natural range of variability for
the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park.
