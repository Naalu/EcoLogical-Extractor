A Strategic Plan to Advance the Pace and Scale of
Restoration  
The Ecological Restoration Institute just released a strategic plan for the next
ﬁve years (2020–2024). As part of the plan, we reﬁned our mission, which is to
serve diverse audiences with objective science and implementation strategies
that support ecological restoration and climate adaptation on western forest
landscapes. Our vision is to see that western forest ecosystems and
communities are healthy, resilient and sustainable. To accomplish our mission
and vision, we created ﬁve focus areas that build from our core strengths of
ecological and social science, land management agency experience, and
science translation and transfer.

on increasing resilience of forests to disturbances such as wildﬁre,
drought, and insect outbreaks. This project capitalizes on existing ERI
data as well as new measurements from our network of long-term study
sites to analyze effects of restoration treatments on indicators of
ecological resilience. Indicators include tree growth, mortality,
regeneration, and ﬁre hazard.
Factors driving landscape changes in ponderosa pine forest
cover. Climate change effects, particularly tree mortality from increasing
drought, pests, and wildﬁre, are likely to be most prevalent where species
occur near their environmental limits. This study is using remote sensing
data and ﬁeld plots to investigate factors related to dynamics of
ponderosa pine forest cover at the edge of this species’ range. Better
understanding of rates and drivers of change will assist managers in
determining restoration approaches prioritizing treatment areas.
Understory responses to wildﬁres managed to achieve resource
objectives. To better understand outcomes of wildﬁres that were
managed to accomplish ecological objectives within various forest types,
ERI scientists are analyzing vegetation data collected from ecosystem
monitoring plots established prior to the ﬁres. Results from this project will
inform planning for landscape-scale restoration. 
Landscape-Scale Restoration Implementation
Federal land managers are striving to innovate in order to increase the
pace and scale of restoration. On Oct. 29–30, the ERI facilitated
a Modernization Workshop for 100 Forest Service staff and partners to
advance understanding and adoption of new technology. The workshop
focused on tablet marking, virtual boundaries, and remote sensing tools.
A peer-to-peer learning format gave participants hands-on exposure to
tech tools and the early adopters who are using them.
The ERI works closely with the Four Forest Restoration Initiative
stakeholders and the Forest Service as science providers and vested
participants in this landscape-scale forest restoration project. We are
helping lead the stakeholder group in developing collaborative, science-
based comments for the second large project area. Comments on the
Rim Country Draft Environmental Impact Statement are due Jan. 15,
2020. Click here for more info.
The ERI is conducting an assessment of Community Wildﬁre

Protection Plans (CWPPs) in Arizona and the western US. CWPPs are
a building block to inform treatment strategies across multiple
jurisdictions. This work is consistent with the Forest Service’s Shared
Stewardship initiative. ERI’s assessment of CWPPs will provide results
on CWPP effectiveness in Arizona, CWPP program strategies in other
western states, and lessons learned and recommendations for effective
CWPP development, implementation, and management in the western
US. This project will be completed with a ﬁnal report and fact sheet in
December 2019. 
National Center for Forest Operations and Wood Utilization
Lack of industry and markets for small-diameter wood and biomass remain a
barrier to rapid restoration throughout the West. Presently, ERI staff are working
on the following projects to enhance the overall economics of restoration
treatments:
Planning grant from US Economic Development Administration for the
development of a Forest Operations Training Center
Wood supply study for pinyon-juniper woodlands
Logistics study for HM3, Inc., an Oregon biotech company, to gather
information needed for the construction and operation of a 50,000-ton-
per-year commercial biocoal plant in northern Arizona
Service to Tribal Communities
Jonathan Martin, the director of ERI’s Native American Forest and
Rangeland Management Program, is working to support tribal natural
resource managers and communities by delivering best available science that
incorporates the recognition of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and
contributes to tribal land management decisions.
A Tribal Forestry Student Summit at Northern Arizona University is
being planned for September 2020.   
High Impact Science Delivery
In November 2019, the ERI hosted an in-the-ﬁeld workshop for land
managers from Prescott and Tonto national forests. ERI staff delivered
the latest research about treatment effectiveness in transitional
pine on those forests.
The three institutes that make up the Southwest Ecological Restoration

Institutes (SWERI) will host a Collaborative Forest Landscape
Restoration Workshop for land managers, researchers and
stakeholders in March 2020 to develop strategies that apply evidence-
based management of collaborative forest landscapes in the
Intermountain West. Participants will discuss issues across shared
stewardship like monitoring, technical science, biomass and wood
utilization, to name a few. Click here for more info.
