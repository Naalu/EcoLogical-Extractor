Abstract
Context
Managers aiming to utilize wildland ﬁre to
restore
southwestern
ponderosa
pine
landscapes
require better understanding of forest cover patterns
produced at multiple scales. Restoration effectiveness
of wildland ﬁres managed for resource beneﬁt can be
evaluated against natural ranges of variation.
Objectives
We describe landscape patterns within
reference landscapes, including restored and function-
ing ponderosa pine forests of northern Arizona, and
compare them to wildland ﬁres managed for resource
beneﬁt. We make comparisons along a gradient of
extents and assess the effects of scale on landscape
differences.
Methods
Using Sentinel-2 imagery, we classiﬁed
ponderosa pine forest cover and calculated landscape
metrics across a gradient of landscape extent within
reference and managed landscapes. We used non-
parametric tests to assess differences. We used random
forest models to assess and explore which landscape
metrics were most importance in differentiating land-
scape patterns.
Results
Restored forests exhibited landscapes pat-
terns consistent with those of ecologically intact forest
landscapes. Managed wildﬁre landscape patterns dif-
fered signiﬁcantly when compared to reference land-
scape patterns among nearly all landscape metrics
considered and became increasingly different with
increasing landscape extent (15–840 ha), tending
towards both denser and larger patch areas.
Conclusions
Landscape patterns from wildland ﬁres
managed for resource beneﬁt we examined differ from
those of reference landscapes. Differences become
more pronounced with increasing landscape size.
Landscape patterns among large managed forest
landscapes suggest that the predominately single-
entry, low-severity disturbance regime from these
managed ﬁres is failing to reduce tree densities and
break up large contiguous areas of canopy cover.

Introduction
In northern Arizona, USA, an extensive history of ﬁre
exclusion and the subsequent densiﬁcation of pon-
derosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum P. & C.
Lawson) forest conditions have led to the need for
landscape-scale restoration (Allen et al. 2002; Moore
et al. 2004; Churchill et al. 2013). Climate change,
uncharacteristic wildﬁre, and other disturbances oper-
ating over spatial extents of thousands of hectares
challenge public land managers to develop landscape-
scale restoration plans. Restoration efforts typically
utilize a combination of mechanical treatments, such
as tree thinning to introduce forest structure compat-
ible with natural ﬁre disturbance processes, yet these
treatments can be costly and limited in scale and are
not suitable for all lands (Hjerpe et al. 2009; Reynolds
et al. 2013; North et al. 2015). Silvicultural prescrip-
tions for mechanized restoration approaches are often
guided by reference information, or descriptions of
intact forest structure and processes (Fule´ et al. 1997;
Reynolds et al. 2013). Such reference information is
commonly used as a baseline against which effective-
ness of various restoration approaches are evaluated
(Morgan et al. 1994; White and Walker 1997; Landres
et al. 1999). For southwestern ponderosa pine forests,
natural ranges of variation have been well described
for ﬁne-scale (\ 10 acres) structural attributes, but
there has been little work done to quantify landscape
patterns among mid- (10–1000 acres) to landscape-
([ 1000 acres) scales of ecologically functioning
forest stands and large restored sites (see Reynolds
et al. 2013). An approach moving beyond typical plot-
based comparisons is needed to capture the variability
of landscape patterns across such a gradient of
landscape scales and examine the current state of
forest structure across the region.
Using naturally occurring wildland (henceforth
‘‘managed wildﬁre’’) ﬁre as an additional or comple-
mentary treatment alternative to mechanical treatment
has seen increased interest (North et al. 2012; Huffman
et al. 2017, 2020). As frequent low-severity surface
ﬁre plays an integral role in regulation of structure and
function in these ponderosa pine ecosystems, managed
wildﬁres may provide a cost-effective approach for
restoring contemporary forest conditions, including
reduction in small-diameter tree densities, lower
hazardous fuel loads and potential ﬁre behavior, and
increased ecological resilience (Hunter et al. 2011;
Ager et al. 2017; Fitch et al. 2018; Barros et al. 2018;
Huffman et al. 2020). While low-severity ﬁre will
provide some beneﬁts, including maintenance of
healthy forest structure, such as tree density, without
mechanical intervention higher severity ﬁre is needed
to alter forest structure to reduce tree density and break
up continuous canopies (Hunter et al. 2011; Hagmann
et al. 2013; McCauley et al. 2019; Owen et al. 2020).
Moderate burn severity among both single- and
multiple-entry managed wildﬁres meet more restora-
tion objectives related to ponderosa pine forest
structure, fuels, and ecological function, than areas
in other burn severity classes, in northern Arizona and
across western North America (Collins et al. 2011;
Lydersen et al. 2013; Huffman et al. 2017, 2018, 2020;
Stevens et al. 2017; Kane et al. 2019). However, the
operational reality within the mosaic of multiuse lands
is such that ﬁre managers are typically averse to the
risks
associated
with
moderate-severity
burning
(Young et al. 2019, 2020), resulting in the majority
of reported treated acres falling into unburned and
low-severity ﬁre, which generally lack the ability to
alter forest structure (Stephens et al. 2016; Huffman
et al. 2017, 2018, 2020; Weber and Yadav 2020).
Given the contemporary structure of southwestern
ponderosa pine forests, large-scale low-intensity ﬁre
results in a homogenized disturbance landscape pat-
tern, as opposed to the more varied patchwork of
disturbance age and intensity that would have existed
historically (Mast et al. 1999; Fule´ et al. 2007;
Reynolds et al. 2013). The relationship of ﬁre severity
and resulting forest structure has largely been studied
at ﬁne-scales using ﬁxed area plots, typically less than
one acre (Sa´nchez Meador et al. 2009, 2011; Huffman
et al. 2017, 2018).
To place managed wildﬁre landscapes in context,
undisturbed, functioning, or restored landscapes (here-
after referred to as reference landscapes) can provide
estimates for a natural range of variability of landscape
structure (White and Walker 1997; Fule´ et al. 2002a;
Collins et al. 2007, 2017). Contemporary restored
forest conditions are particularly helpful for deriving
landscape-scale reference information, as landscape
metrics derived from reconstructed, small-extents
(0.04–1 ha) are notoriously difﬁcult to extrapolate to
larger extents (e.g. 800 ha) due to the highly dynamic
disturbance regime of in frequent ﬁre forests over
larger scales and lack of large-scale empirical evi-
dence(Sa´nchez Meador et al. 2011; Barth et al. 2015;
123
Landscape Ecol

Cannon et al. 2018). Today, precious few landscapes
exist in the Southwest we would consider ecologically
intact, but notable exceptions include remote areas in
national parks and wilderness areas, as well as large
landscape with ongoing monitoring efforts (Roc-
caforte et al. 2010; Strahan et al. 2015; Stoddard
et al. 2018). For this study, we chose to compare both
ecologically functioning and ecologically restored
landscapes, which together provide more comprehen-
sive estimates of the natural range of variability of
landscape metrics examined here and baseline infor-
mation for evaluating outcomes of managed wildﬁres
in southwestern ponderosa pine forests.
Quantifying forest structure over large areas is only
possible through remote sensing approaches, which
have a well-established role within forest research.
Speciﬁcally, medium resolution (10–100 m) multi-
spectral satellite imagery such as the Landsat family of
satellites
(30 m)
or
the
Sentinel-2
satellites
(10–20 m), provide frequent image coverage that
can be used to monitor forest cover and dynamics
(Eidenshink et al. 2007; Wulder et al. 2012; Li and
Roy 2017). While we cannot directly measure tree
density or tree size or age distribution, those compo-
nents of forest structure are directly correlated to forest
cover (Donager et al. 2021), allowing us to gain insight
in to the overall structure of the forest through a
snapshot from above. The quantiﬁcation of forest
structure from inter-stand (* 15 ha) to landscape
scales ([ 400 ha) is sensitive to the grain of the data
used to quantify landscape metrics (Wasserman et al.
2019). Imagery from the Sentinel-2 satellites are
medium-resolution (10–20 m), multispectral (12 spec-
tral band) datasets and provide wall-to-wall coverage
every 5 days on average (Li and Roy 2017). While
sacriﬁcing ﬁne-scale (e.g., 1–3 m) detail compared to
higher-resolution datasets, which are often also lim-
ited to four multispectral bands, Sentinel-2 imagery
allowed for increased discrimination of land cover
types through integrating spectral and temporal infor-
mation into the classiﬁcation scheme (Li and Roy
2017).
The intent of this study was to quantify forest
structure through classiﬁcation of forest cover from
remotely-sensed imagery across a gradient of land-
scape scales to better understand spatial patterns
within wildland ﬁres managed for resource beneﬁt
and reference landscapes, consisting of restored and
functioning ponderosa pine forests. From the forest
cover classiﬁcation, we calculated a suite of landscape
metrics to quantify landscape patterns. We then used a
series of random forest models to better understand
which components of landscape structure are driving
the differences between these two landscape types and
the scales at which those differences manifest. To
accomplish this, we focused on three speciﬁc objec-
tives: (1) quantify and test differences in landscape
metrics calculated across a gradient of landscape
extents among managed and reference landscapes,
including restored and functioning landscapes (2)
determine which landscape metrics are most important
for distinguishing landscapes and identify how this
relationship changes with landscape extent, and (3)
interpret the management implications of multi-scale
landscape metric differences among landscape types.
Methods
Study area
Our study focused on two classes of landscapes within
northern Arizona among federally controlled lands
(Fig. 1): reference and wildﬁre managed for resource
beneﬁt. Reference landscapes included both intact and
experimental restoration landscapes. We included four
large reference landscapes (\ 840 ha) and seven small
(* 10–15 ha) experimental restoration areas in the
study (Table 1). We compared these collectively
described reference landscapes to 16 recent and
sufﬁciently large managed ﬁres which ﬁt the study
criteria (Fig. 1, Table 1). The sites encompassed a
range of elevation, soil type, and topography, which in
turn inﬂuences local climate. Average yearly precip-
itation ranges from 385 to 825 mm (1st and 99th
percentiles of precipitation) and average temperatures
range from 6.1 to 12.0 C (1st and 99th percentiles of
temperature) when considering values within the
distribution of ponderosa pine across the study area
(PRISM Climate Group, accessed May 2020). Eleva-
tion within the distribution of ponderosa pine range
from 1346 to 3449 m across the study extent. Inter-
national soil classiﬁcations across the study area are
generally Luvisols and Kastanozems (Hengl et al.
2017). We limited our study to the distribution of the
‘‘Rocky Mountain Ponderosa Pine Woodland’’ forest
type land cover according to Southwest ReGAP data
(SWReGAP 2005), as this represents forest cover

Restoration sites were only used for comparisons to managed ﬁre landscapes at the smallest extent. The percent area by ﬁre severity
(U: unburned, L: low, M: moderate, and H: high) was calculated from Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS); dominant soil
groups are an international soil classiﬁcation for each area from SoilGrids data (Hengl et al. 2017); and mean climatic variables are
30-year averages from PRISM (PRISM Climate Group 2020). Reference landscape mean elevations were not signiﬁcantly different
from resource objective wildﬁre mean elevations according to Wilcoxian rank sum and Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests, while restoration
site elevations were signiﬁcantly higher in elevation

dominated by ponderosa pine, but can include other
components, including Gambel oak (Quercus gambe-
lii). For a managed wildﬁre to be included in the study,
the bounding polygon needed to be classiﬁed predom-
inantly (2/3) as this forest type.
The four large reference landscapes for this study
included Mt. Trumbull, a restored experimental land-
scape initially treated with a thin/harvest treatment in
1996–1997 followed by initial prescribed ﬁre and
subsequent maintenance burning in 2000–2008 (Roc-
caforte et al. 2010); and Powell Plateau, Rainbow
Plateau and Fire Point, three landscapes considered
intact and ecologically functioning as logging and ﬁre
suppression have not occurred in large part due to their
remoteness on the North Kaibab Plateau (Fule´ et al.
2002a, 2004). Small experimental restoration sites
(see Table 1) were treated using evidence-based
ecological restoration guidelines (‘‘ERG’’ sensu Tuten
et al. 2015) wherein the resulting forest structure was
targeted to be consistent with site-speciﬁc historical
conditions and ranged (see Fule´ et al. 2001, 2002b) in
size from 8 to 15 ha (Table 1). These experimental
sites located within Centennial Forest, Fort Valley
Experimental Forest on the Coconino National Forest,
and the Tusayan Ranger District (Fig. 1) of the Kaibab
National Forest. All reference landscapes and restora-
tion sites are dominated by ponderosa pine (P.
ponderosa), but also include varying amounts of
Gambel oak (Q. gambelii).
We selected recent managed wildﬁres for analysis
which met the following criteria: (1) size ([ 405 ha),
(2) year of occurrence between 2015 and 2018, (3)
identiﬁed as being managed for resource beneﬁt from
the Forest Service Activity Tracking System (FACTS)
database and (4) had a vegetation cover type domi-
nated ([ 66%) by ponderosa pine, as classiﬁed by the
Southwest ReGAP land cover classiﬁcation (Lowry
et al. 2007). We cross-referenced selected ﬁres with
the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS)
dataset to ensure the dates, locations, and perimeter of
wildﬁres matched (MTBS 2017). A total of 16
wildﬁres matched all criteria (Fig. 1, Table 1). Fire
weather and fuels information for each ﬁre on the date
of ignition is included in the Online Appendix (A). We
used FireFamily Plus (4.2) to summarize fuels and
weather conditions for the ﬁrst 30 days following
ignition of the wildﬁres (Bradshaw and McCormick
2009). Historical weather data summarized was from
Happy Jack (ID 020291), Flagstaff (ID 020209), and
Tusayan, Arizona (ID 020207) Remote Automated
Weather Stations. As our focus for this study was on
ponderosa pine forest, we removed any ﬁre meeting
our criteria but not having a majority proportion of
ponderosa pine forest cover (\ 66%). Among the total
burned area covered by the 16 wildﬁres, approxi-
mately 90% was classiﬁed as unburned and low
severity, while medium and high severity classiﬁca-
tions were 8.3% and 1.7%, respectively (www.mtbs.
gov).
Canopy cover classiﬁcation
We used seasonal image composites of Sentinel-2
satellite imagery to classify the landscape into four
categories: evergreen canopy cover, deciduous canopy
cover, non-tree cover and water. As our areas of
interest were limited in extent, this simple classiﬁca-
tion scheme proved to be adequate to isolate pon-
derosa pine cover from deciduous cover, particularly
Gambel oak. We built the seasonal image composites
in Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al. 2017) using
Sentinel-2 level 2A multispectral imagery calibrated
to surface reﬂectance for the year 2019. These images
are radiometrically calibrated and geographically
referenced. For each seasonal composite, we calcu-
lated the median value for each pixel after masking out
cloud and cloud shadow pixels from the image stack
using all available imagery in a time period that
spanned 1 month prior to and following solstice and
equinox dates. We conducted all subsequent analysis,
including random forest classiﬁcation models of the
image composites in R using the ranger package (ver
0.12.1; Wright and Ziegler 2017) for random forest
classiﬁcation. Rasters representing elevation (http://
ned.usgs.gov), derived slope and aspect as well as a
soil parent material classiﬁcation (Theobald et al.
2015) were included in the classiﬁcation. We main-
tained the pixel resolution of the classiﬁcation and
resulting grain of landscape analyses at 10 m based on
the Sentinel-2 imagery by down sampling coarser
resolution image bands using a smoothing ﬁlter to
match the resolution of the visible and near-infrared
bands.
We built training and testing datasets of labeled
point locations through manually examining NAIP
imagery (2017) in combination with summarized
Sentinel-2 image stacks to ensure selected points were
not in an incorrect pixel due to geographic offsets of
123

the two datasets. The non-tree category was an all-
inclusive ‘‘other’’ category which, for example,
included training points representing bare ground,
herbaceous cover, and roads. All training and testing
points were located inside of a 1 km buffered area of
reference landscape and wildﬁre perimeters. A total of
450 training points were chosen, with approximately
equal quantities for each category (* 130 points)
other than water (59 points).
The resulting canopy cover classiﬁcation had an
accuracy of 99.7% based on out-of-bag sampling, or
compared tothe training labels, from the random forest
model creation. A manual accuracy assessment was
conducted using250 randomly sampled points gener-
ated within 1 km of reference landscapes and managed
wildﬁre perimeters(Table 2). Overall accuracy was
less than the random forest out-of-bag estimate, but
still high at 93%. Mean Usersaccuracy was 91% while
mean producer’s accuracy was 92%.
Sampling along a gradient of landscape extents
From our classiﬁed map, we calculated landscape
metrics along a gradient of subsampled extents
randomly generated within the reference and wildﬁre
landscape perimeters. This approach allowed us to
move beyond the traditional dependency on plot-
based comparisons and undertake a more holistic
assessment of each landscape. As ponderosa pine was
the dominant component of the landscape, and the
cover type forest managers are interested in manipu-
lating, we eliminated all other cover classiﬁcation
types before calculating metrics (Fig. 2). While we
calculated a total of 55 class-level landscape metrics
using the R package landscapemetrics (ver 1.4;
Hesselbarth et al. 2019), we chose to focus on twelve
metrics which encompassing a range of relevance to
land management. Metrics analyzed were patch area
and edge, core area, and several shape and aggregation
metrics (see Table 1). A complete list of class-level
landscape metrics and corresponding summaries for al
focal landscapes (55 metrics) are included in Online
Appendix B. For each landscape extent from that of
restoration sites (* 15 ha) to the largest managed
wildﬁre extent (* 15,000 ha), we calculated all class-
level landscape metrics. For the purposes of this
research, we speciﬁcally focus on a set of landscape
metrics directly applicable to landscape-scale forest
management among area and edge metrics (proportion
of landscape, mean and standard deviation of patch
area, and edge density), core area metrics (core area
proportion of landscape, mean and standard deviation

of the core area index), shape metrics (mean and
standard deviation of the shape index), and aggrega-
tion metrics (patch density, normalized landscape
shape index, and the division index). For further
details, see McGarigal et al. (2012). We compared
restoration sites to larger reference landscapes by
randomly sampling 15 ha extents from within the
reference landscape boundary to create a distribution
of metrics at that same extent, allowing sampled
extents to overlap at random (Fig. 2B). In the same
way, we compared reference landscapes to managed
wildﬁres among intervals of landscape extents by
subsampling both within reference landscapes and
managed wildﬁre boundaries and comparing the
resulting distribution of landscape metrics. In this
way, comparisons were made at each of those extents
so as to avoid metric comparisons sensitive to extent
(Wasserman et al. 2019). The maximum extent for
comparison was approximately 800 ha, which was
determined by the maximum size of available refer-
ence landscapes within the study area. We generated
subsampled extents by randomly generating point
locations within an inward-buffered landscape and
buffering those points by the appropriate radius to
achieve the desired extent which was then clipped by
the landscape boundary (Fig. 2). The size of the
inward buffer is a function of the radius of the desired
subsample extent. The number of points generated is a
function of the desired subsample extent area and the
total area of the landscape, whereby for each individ-
ual landscape, we divided the total area by the target
sampled extent, multiplied that resulting number by
three, and chose that many random samples within that
landscape with an interior buffer to reduce sampled
areas falling too much outside the landscape extent
Those sampled points were then buffered to the correct
target extent. Resulting extent polygons were then
ﬁltered by removing buffered polygons whose cen-
troid fell within a threshold number of resulting
polygons (C 5% of the total subsampled extents
within the landscape) to promote the independence
of the metrics calculated within a given landscape. As
a ﬁnal check, subsampled extents were removed if
they were less than 75% of the target landscape extent
area.
Comparisons of landscape metrics
Our analysis resulted in three general strata of
landscape metrics: (1) inclusion of restoration sites
at approximately 15 ha extent, (2) comparisons to
reference landscapes up to approximately 800 ha
extent, and (3) values only resulting from large
wildﬁres
up
to
approximately
15,000 ha
extent
(Fig. 2). Managed wildﬁres varied in size, from 452
to 14,529 ha while reference landscapes were smaller
overall, ranging from 8 to 800 ha (Table 1). We only
compared metrics calculated at similar extents, for
each extent considered. Comparisons of metrics drawn
from different landscape types were made using the
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (Marsaglia et al. 2003) in
addition to the Mann–Whitney test (Sijtsma and
Emons 2010). For both tests, signiﬁcance was deter-
mined by an alpha value smaller than that of the
appropriate Bonferroni correction (a = 0.01). The
two-sample
Kolmogorov–Smirnov
test
is

were generated (red dots). And then buffered and clipped to the

nonparametric test of how similar the shapes are for
two continuous distributions are through a comparison
of the empirical distribution function and the cumu-
lative distribution function of the two samples,
respectively (Marsaglia et al. 2003). The Mann–
Whitney test is also a nonparametric rank sum test
which examines the probability than any single sample
is drawn from differing distributions (Sijtsma and
Emons 2010).
Determining metric importance across scale using
random forest classiﬁers
Finally, to understand which landscape metrics were
the most important in discriminating reference and
managed wildﬁre landscapes and how those differ-
ences changed with scale, we implemented a series of
random forest classiﬁcation models and retrieved
variable importance, model accuracy, and sample
sizes for each model (n = 11). Random forest models
were built using the 12 landscape metrics as predictors
of landscape type (managed vs. reference). Models
were built using 10,000 trees and assessing half of the
landscape metrics at each tree node and individual
landscape metric importance was assessed using a
permutation approach within the random forest model.
Variable importance values in combination with
model accuracy were used to infer how individual
landscape metrics are more or less differentiable
across the scale gradient applicable to both reference
and managed wildﬁre landscapes. Kendall rank cor-
relation coefﬁcients among the variables are included
as an Online Appendix (C).
Results
Comparison of small restoration sites to reference
landscapes
We initially compared landscape metrics among
restored (15 ha) and reference landscapes (\ 800 ha)
as separate groups. However, testing showed that
restored and reference landscapes were not statisti-
cally different from one another at our smallest
landscape extent (Fig. 3). Because our analysis
showed that these sites were consistent with functional
landscapes when randomly subsampled at a similar
extent (* 15 ha) from both Kolmogorov–Smirnov
and Mann–Whitney test results we collapsed these
categories into the singular ‘reference’ landscape
category for further analysis. Of the metrics we
examined, only edge density displayed signiﬁcant
differences (Fig. 3). Elevations of the smaller restored
sites were greater than the managed wildﬁre land-
scapes on average, according to Wilcox and Kol-
mogorov–Smirnov tests. However, they were not
signiﬁcantly
different
from
larger
reference
landscapes.
Comparisons of landscape metrics among extents
Similarities among restoration and reference land-
scape metrics justiﬁed combining them into a single
‘‘reference’’ class (see section ‘Comparisons of land-
scape metrics’). Most landscape metrics were signif-
icantly different between reference and wildﬁre
landscapes across the gradient of all extents tested
(Fig. 4). The entirety of landscape metric values (55
metrics) are included as an Online Appendix (B).
Among most landscape metrics we focused on, the
distribution of metric values was signiﬁcantly differ-
ent according to both statistical tests and differences
tended to increase as sampled extent increased. Of
particular note were proportion of the landscape, (i.e.,
canopy cover), mean and standard deviation of canopy
patch area, all three aggregation metrics, and the
standard deviation of the shape index (Fig. 4). Median
canopy cover in managed landscapes decreased with
scale from 70.5% (15-ha extent) to 60.8% (840-ha
extent) and continued to less than 50% at the largest
wildland ﬁre extent (15,000-ha). Similarly, canopy
cover on reference landscapes decreased from 48.8%
(15-ha) to 28.8% (840-ha). Differences in canopy
cover between landscapes were statistically signiﬁcant
across all extents tested. Median patch area similarly
decreased with scale, from 2.17 ± 3.32 ha (15-ha
extent) to 1.5 ± 22.4 ha (840-ha extent) among
managed landscapes and from 0.52 ± 1.45 ha (15-
ha extent) to 0.24 ± 1.78 ha (840-ha extent) among
reference landscapes. The opposite relationship was
true for patch density, which increased from 33.2 ha-1
(15-ha extent) to 40.9 ha-1 (840-ha extent) among
managed landscapes and from 84.1 ha-1 (15-ha
extent) to 122.2 ha-1 (840-ha extent) among reference
landscapes.
Of the remaining landscape metrics, the distribu-
tion of landscape metric values among reference and
123

managed wildﬁre sampled extents were signiﬁcantly
different among smaller landscape extent comparisons
but became non-signiﬁcantly different from one
another as sampled landscape extent increased accord-
ing to both comparison tests (Fig. 4). However, the
majority of metric distributions were signiﬁcantly
different according to the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.
The notable exception was edge density, for which
both tests were not signiﬁcant at any sampled extent
but differed signiﬁcantly according to the Kol-
mogorov–Smirnov
test

comparison for managed wildﬁre extents greater than
840 ha, among the majority of landscape metrics the
trend established among smaller extents continued
through the largest extent of 15,000 ha, with metrics
tending smaller or larger in accordance with values
extracted from smaller sampled extents (Fig. 4).
Landscape metric importance across scale
Overall, relative importance of the twelve landscape
metrics for distinguishing between managed wildﬁres
and reference sites decline with increasing landscape
extent with greater importance among scales less than

extents within reference landscapes (blue) and managed
wildﬁres (red) for area and edge (Area), core area (Core),

metrics for the largest extents of wildﬁres, comparisons to
reference were only possible up to 840 ha extents. Individual

240 ha (Fig. 5A). Despite this, model accuracy
increased to nearly 100% with increasing sampled
extent, increasingly rapidly up to 240 ha (Fig. 5B, C).
In other words, as landscape extent increases, our
resulting models were better able to distinguish
landscape type (reference vs. managed) given less
data and increasingly similar variable importance
among predictors. An inﬂection in predictive accuracy
appears to occur at the 240-ha scale (Fig. 5).
Area and aggregation metrics were consistently the
most important landscape metrics for discriminating
between landscape types across all scales examined.
Speciﬁcally, proportion of the landscape, mean patch
area and the normalized landscape shape index were
the most important among landscape extents smaller
than 240 ha (Fig. 5). Among these intermediary scales
(up to 240 ha), we observed a shift in which variables
were most important from proportion of landscape and
the normalized landscape shape index to patch area
and patch density. Patch area and division index are
the most important landscape metrics at the largest
extent (840 ha). Shape metrics were consistently less
important among all scales while edge density was the
least important metric at all extents greater than
240 ha (Fig. 5).
Discussion
Through a landscape-scale assessment of forest
canopy cover and landscape patterns, we found that
restored forests exhibited patterns consistent with
intact landscapes and that managed wildﬁres were
largely unsuccessful at altering forest structure. We
also found that homogeneity of landscape pattern
increased with landscape scale, but homogeneity
trends differed signiﬁcantly among reference and
managed wildﬁre landscapes. While aggregate differ-
ences are relatively minor at small scales, stemming
from a high degree of variability, differences tended to
increase with scale and the metrics deﬁning those
differences change in their importance as we moved to
landscape scales. Although we initially explored a
large suite of landscape metrics, we ultimately con-
centrated on twelve common metrics which easily
translate to forest management and silvicultural pre-
scriptions (Reynolds et al. 2013; Churchill et al. 2013;
Rodman et al. 2016), were parsimonious in their
description of landscape pattern (Cushman et al.
2008), and have been found to be useful in evaluating
restoration treatment success (Dickinson et al. 2016;
Ziegler et al. 2017; Huffman et al. 2017). Our

forest models for each extent from 15 to 840 ha (A), sample
sizes for each landscape extent (B) and overall model accuracy
for each scale (C). Variable importance was normalized to a 0–1
scale for ease of interpretation. Overall, variables became less
important with increasing landscape extent while overall model
accuracy increases to nearly 100%, despite having fewer
samples to draw from. Area and aggregation metrics remain
the most important metric classes among all models. Importance
values were re-scaled from 0 to 1 by dividing by the maximum
importance value from the model series

approach to assessing differences across scale allowed
us to examine those outcomes and provided some
insight into the scales at which management would be
necessary to address particular ecological processes
and functions (Kerr and Ostrovsky 2003; Uuemaa
et al. 2013; Wan et al. 2020) and could serve to help
outline future restoration planning efforts (Churchill
et al. 2013; Dickinson et al. 2016; Cannon et al. 2020;
Wan et al. 2020).
Reference landscape patterns
Landscape patterns at restored sites around the 15-ha
extent were consistent with those of intact ponderosa
pine forest landscapes that had not experienced
notable impacts of late nineteenth century livestock
grazing and ﬁre exclusion. Based on this initial result,
we were able to combine restored and functioning
landscapes into a single reference class for subsequent
analysis. This is unsurprising, as the removal of trees
during the process of restoration mimics the discon-
tinuous canopy patterns we would expect from low-
severity, frequent ﬁres over sufﬁciently long time
periods. Mount Trumbull stands out as a unique
landscape in the Southwest in that it was the only
large, restored landscape in the region we could
include in the study. Ambitious efforts are presently
underway to apply restoration treatments across
millions
of
hectares
throughout
the
Southwest
(Schultz et al. 2012), but much more needs to be
treated to assist with the restoration of large land-
scapes. Similarity between restoration sites and intact
landscapes suggests that restoration treatments, as
implemented using the ERG method (see Tuten et al.
2015), have measurably promoted forest structural
conditions consistent with reference landscapes, com-
plementing many previous studies relying on plot-
based measurements of forest structure (Mast et al.
1999; Fule´ et al. 2002b; Waltz et al. 2003; Roccaforte
et al. 2010, 2015; Tuten et al. 2015). Canopy
proportion of the landscape, mean patch size and
patch density were very similar among restored and
functioning landscapes, with restored landscapes were
comprised of smaller and denser canopy patches. Edge
density was the only metric that showed signiﬁcant
differences between restored and intact landscapes.
This single difference could result from the imple-
mentation of mechanical treatments which have
operation limitations and target the restoration of
functioning conditions through tree spacing and patch
sizes, but fail to promote spatial complexity that stems
from low-severity, frequent ﬁre (Hargis et al. 1998;
McIver et al. 2013).
Elevations of small restoration sites did prove to be
higher than those of managed wildﬁres but did not
signiﬁcantly differ from elevations of large reference
landscapes. While these landscapes tended to be
slightly higher in elevation, on average, they do not
persist at the upper limit of ponderosa pine distribu-
tion, but reside well inside the elevation band of
ponderosa pine forests (Moir et al. 1997). It should
also be noted that these larger reference landscapes
only occur in the northern latitudes of our study area.
While we desired to incorporate a greater number of
reference landscapes representing a greater diversity
of environmental conditions, this was simply not a
possibility within the forests of our study area as they
did not exist. These larger landscapes represent what
we expect to see given the range of environmental and
disturbance factors that would have existed histori-
cally across the region (Moir et al. 1997; Reynolds
et al. 2013; Ritter et al. 2020). The structure of these
reference landscapes is dependent upon the removal of
trees and limits on establishment, through either
mechanical (e.g. restoration activities) or disturbance
(e.g. low-severity ﬁre) mechanisms, coupled with
frequently recurring ﬁre to maintain those structural
patterns (Covington et al. 1997; Fule´ et al. 2002a;
Stoddard et al. 2021).
Comparisons to managed wildland ﬁres
Landscape metrics derived from wildland ﬁres man-
aged for resource beneﬁt were signiﬁcantly different
from those of reference sites across the gradient of
landscape extents we examined. Managed wildﬁres
exhibited greater canopy cover, larger patch size and
corresponding lower patch density, and divergent
shape complexity as compared with reference sites.
Taken together, these differences continue to reﬂect
the denser forest conditions typical of ﬁre-excluded
ponderosa pine forests that dominate a region where
surface ﬁre has been excluded for decades and
thinning activities have not yet occurred (Covington
et al. 1997). Dense forest conditions and larger patches
of contiguous canopy on the managed wildﬁre sites
reﬂect the management tendency towards unburned or
low burn severity and limited re-entry, conclusions
123
Landscape Ecol

that parallel those drawn in previous studies examin-
ing managed wildﬁres in the Southwest (Huffman
et al. 2017, 2018). While these studies have suggested
that some mixed severities may be necessary to alter
forest structure, only one ﬁre examined had greater
than 10% of its area classiﬁed as moderate burn
severity, and only two ﬁres had more than 1% of total
area classiﬁed as high severity. Current research has
shown that the presence of high-severity conditions
within a managed wildﬁre is correlated with landscape
patterns within southwestern forests (Singleton et al.
2021). Interestingly, edge density was similar among
all landscape types in our study, perhaps resulting
from larger patches having a similar amount of patch
edge to that observed for smaller, yet more complex,
canopy patches (see Cushman et al. 2008) and perhaps
suggesting edge density is not a good metric for
assessing active forest management.
Larger contiguous patches of forest canopy within
managed wildﬁres suggest that numerous restoration
objectives, such as the reduction of canopy fuels and
crown ﬁre hazard, promotion of understory plant
production and diversity through decreased resource
competition from overstory trees, and increases in
habitat suitability for wildlife species associated with
forest edges, have not been effectively met (Covington
et al. 1997; Laughlin et al. 2008; Fule´ et al. 2012;
Reynolds et al. 2013). Homogeneity of forest canopy
and lack of structural complexity also increase
vulnerability of ecosystems to landscape-scale distur-
bances such as stand-replacing wildﬁre, bark beetle
attacks, and density-dependent or drought induced
mortality (Covington et al. 1997, Agee and Skinner
2005; Kolb et al. 2007; McWethy et al. 2019).
Although, interconnected tree crowns and greater
canopy cover are important for some wildlife species,
such as the tassel-eared squirrel (Sciurus aberti),
Mexican spotted-owl (Strix occidentalis lucida), and
northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) (Ganey et al.
1999; Prather et al. 2006; Loberger et al. 2011; Tuten
et al. 2015; Bagdon et al. 2016), severe loss of habitat
due to stand-replacing ﬁre remains of high concern to
forest managers. Over time, repeated ﬁre occurrence,
especially if allowed to burn at severity levels that
reduce tree density, can increase heterogeneity by
breaking up larger forest stands and creating discon-
tinuous, smaller tree patches as well as moderating
understory tree growth into the overstory (Hargis et al.
1998; Covington et al. 2001; Hunter et al. 2011;
Reynolds et al. 2013; Huffman et al. 2018; Kane et al.
2019). Thus, to meet objectives associated with
ecological restoration, repeated low- to moderate-
severity wildﬁres are necessary to disrupt continuous
canopy structure typical of ﬁre-excluded forests and
restore spatial patterns more consistent with the
natural range of variation (Allen et al. 2002; Reynolds
et al. 2013; Huffman et al. 2017). If ﬁres are
consistently managed for minimal effects and low
burn severity, time required to incrementally produce
ﬁne-grain structural patterns may be beyond typical
planning horizons for public land managers (Collins
et al. 2009; van Wagtendonk et al. 2012; Huffman
et al. 2018; Yocom et al. 2019). Generally, fragmen-
tation, which in ﬁre-excluded ponderosa pine forests is
likely to increase heterogeneity, has been shown to be
linearly related to the proportion of the landscape
disturbed (Hargis et al. 1998; McGarigal et al. 2012).
First-entry wildﬁres can reestablish canopy structure
consistent with reference landscapes if allowed to burn
at some moderate severities (Huffman et al. 2018;
Kane et al. 2019), but this is often not preferable when
natural resource and other values are perceived to be at
high risk (North et al. 2015).
Landscape patterns in southwestern ponderosa pine
forests are a product of the dominant disturbance
process: low-severity, frequent ﬁre (Allen et al. 2002;
Veblen 2003; Reynolds et al. 2013). In a functioning
forest, such as our reference landscapes, this distur-
bance is sufﬁcient to maintain low tree density and
discontinuous canopy, but fails to do so once the age of
dominant trees develop ﬁre resistance and high tree
densities promote canopy transmission of ﬁre (Rey-
nolds et al. 2013; Taranco´n et al. 2014; Bottero et al.
2017; Ritter et al. 2020). Repeated low-severity
wildﬁre will promote heterogeneity at small scales,
but lead to homogenous landscape patterns at increas-
ingly larger scales (Wasserman et al. 2019). Our
results showed that among all landscape metrics,
greater variability transitions to increased homogene-
ity of metric values with increases in landscape extent.
While the range of landscape metric values became
increasingly constrained with increasing extent, ref-
erence landscape metrics were generally more con-
strained than their managed wildﬁre counterpart,
suggesting that heterogeneity may not have been a
key element at all scales for reference landscapes. It is
possible that we were not able to examine landscapes

Landscape Ecol

heterogeneity at larger landscape extents, exemplify-
ing a key constraint to our study, the lack of large
reference landscapes. Variability in patch area was the
only metric examined which exhibited the opposite
pattern of increased heterogeneity with increasing
scale, and this was only among managed wildﬁre
landscapes. This was likely due to increasingly large
patches being included in summaries as extents
became larger; the same was not true for reference
landscapes.
The effect of scale on metrics
We were surprised by the random forest model results
showing that decreasing sample sizes among larger
landscapes extents were associated with increasing
model accuracy, coupled with an overall decline in
variable importance (Cutler et al. 2007). These results
suggest that the landscape types predicted in the model
became
increasingly
differentiable
with
smaller
amounts of data. In other words, as landscape extent
increased, managed and reference landscapes became
increasingly distinct. Increased homogeneity of land-
scape metrics with increasing landscape extent sug-
gest that these landscape types homogenize with scale
in different ways, which is also evident in the distinct
trajectories of each landscape metric across the
gradient of sampled extents. An inﬂection in both
model accuracy and variable importance was apparent
at the 240-ha landscape extent, coincidentally corre-
sponding to a suggested deﬁnition of mid-scale
landscape structure in southwestern ponderosa pine
forests (Reynolds et al. 2013). The inﬂection suggests
that landscapes are more variable among scales up to
240 ha, likely the result of ﬁne-scale processes and
management (Kalies and Yocom Kent 2016; Ritter
et al. 2020), but become increasingly homogeneous
following scales greater than this threshold, exhibiting
diverging structural patterns.
Landscape metrics scaled predictably across the
gradient of extents we examined, consistent with a
type I scaling relationship (Wu and Hobbs 2002; Wu
2004). We expect this behavior in ponderosa pine
forests due to the dominant disturbance regime of low-
intensity wildﬁre, leading to increased homogeneity
with scale (Wasserman et al. 2019). We see evidence
for this as the range of most metric values became
increasingly constrained as the scale of landscape
extents grew, while tending towards divergent metric
values for each landscape type. Understanding the
behavior of ponderosa pine forest landscape patterns is
necessary for scale-dependent ecological function and
management objectives (Turner and Gardner 2015),
including wildland ﬁre behavior (Povak et al. 2018),
habitat suitability (Timm et al. 2016; McGarigal et al.
2016; Wan et al. 2020), forest health and ecohydrol-
ogy (Stevens 2017), and climate mitigation and carbon
sequestration (McCauley et al. 2019). Shape metrics
were consistently unimportant in our models, suggest-
ing area and aggregation metrics may be more
important for assessing treatment effectiveness and
guiding future restoration plans.
Methods, limitations and next steps
Our classiﬁcation of ponderosa pine forest cover had
high accuracy according to both out-of-bag model
training and an independent comparison of manual
classiﬁcations. This was in part due to the relatively
simple classiﬁcation scheme as well as the inclusion of
a seasonal component, which effectively discrimi-
nated between evergreen and deciduous vegetation.
While the Sentinel-2 imagery can fail to detect single
trees and small tree groups due to the size of the object
of interest relative to the 10-m resolution of the
imagery, the resolution is sufﬁcient to detect mature
individual trees or tree groups of ponderosa pine due to
their average size (e.g. we expect a mature ponderosa
to have a radius around 6 m) and thus appropriate for
examining forest structure over large landscapes
(Wasserman et al. 2019; Grabska et al. 2020; Schu-
macher et al. 2020). See Wasserman et al. (2019) for a
comparison of landscape metrics resulting from a
gradient of data resolution. Higher resolution data,
such as lidar or airborne imagery, may more accu-
rately capture smaller patch sizes; however, expense
and availability of these types of datasets for regional
landscapes is limited (Buyantuyev and Wu 2007;
Wasserman et al. 2019). We suggest that methods used
in our study have broad applicability for assessment
and post-treatment monitoring of ponderosa pine
forest structure in the Southwest (see also Botequilha
Leita˜o and Ahern 2002; de Almeida et al. 2020).
However, further research is needed to understand
why metrics vary not only with extent, but also grain
as interpretation of landscape structure and pattern are
known to vary with grain (Hargis et al. 1998;
Buyantuyev and Wu 2007; Corry and Lafortezza
123
Landscape Ecol

2007; Rutchey and Godin 2009; Sˇı´mova´ and Gdulova´
2012; Wasserman et al. 2019; Wickham and Riitters
2019).
We were limited by potential reference landscape
quantity, size, and abiotic variability; stemming from
the widespread and prolonged effects of historical
livestock grazing and ﬁre exclusion (Covington et al.
1997; Moore et al. 1999; Reynolds et al. 2013) and the
limited large-scale restoration activities that have
occurred to date. With these limitations of reference
landscapes, we were unable to control for the entirety
of potential variation in abiotic factors, speciﬁcally
soil parent material, elevation, topography, climate,
and disturbance history (Puhlick et al. 2012; Larson
and Churchill 2012; Reynolds et al. 2013; Rodman
et al. 2017). Sampling extents from reference land-
scapes were limited to a maximum of approximately
800 ha, while managed wildﬁre landscapes included
in our analysis were as large as 15,000 ha. This
discrepancy presents an inherent challenge for under-
standing reference landscapes of the Southwest, where
managers desire to better understand the importance
scale on structural metrics and where comparisons
between contemporary and reference landscapes are
instrumental to assessing treatment effectiveness. We
hope to increase the geographic footprint of the study
area in future research, but with that increased
geographic scope comes the need to account for
increasingly diverse sources of variability in both
biotic and abiotic factors contributing to forest struc-
ture (Johnston et al. 2016; Rodman et al. 2017). The
scarcity of reference landscapes reiterates the urgent
need for accelerated large-scale forest management
(Stephens et al. 2016; Cannon et al. 2018), but also
highlights continued difﬁculties in managing for
ecologically functioning, resilient forest landscapes
under threat of climate change and competing land
uses (Bradford and D’Amato 2012; Stanturf et al.
2014; Jacobs et al. 2015; Gleason et al. 2017;
McCauley et al. 2019; Cannon et al. 2020).
While our smaller (\ 15 ha) reference sites tended
to be slightly higher (\ 100 m) in elevation as
compared to our managed wildﬁre elevations, these
site elevations did not signiﬁcantly differ from larger
restoration landscapes, nor did the elevations of larger
reference landscapes signiﬁcantly differ from man-
aged wildﬁre landscapes. The smaller (\ 15 ha)
reference sites were only included in the smallest
scale comparison to managed wildﬁre landscapes (1 of
11 comparison extents) and make up only four percent
of the sample size at that scale. The managed wildﬁre
landscapes we examined encompass a greater range of
elevations compared to reference landscapes, but
mean differences in elevation are less than 100 m,
on average. We also did not include wildﬁres at the
upper or lower elevational limits of ponderosa pine
forest, having ﬁltered potential ﬁres to only include
predominately ponderosa pine forest types based on an
auxiliary land cover classiﬁcation. Research suggests
that within the limited regional extent included in the
study, the managed ﬁre landscapes we examined
would have exhibited a structure prior to disturbance
largely in line with that of reference landscapes (Mast
et al. 1999; Allen et al. 2002; Williams and Baker
2012; Rodman et al. 2017).
Conclusion
In general, southwestern ponderosa pine forest land-
scape patterns resulting from wildland ﬁres managed
for resource beneﬁt differ from reference landscape
pattern at analogous scales. Ecologically functioning
landscapes, both relict and restored, facilitated com-
parisons up to approximately 800 ha, a scale at which
we found managed wildﬁre landscapes signiﬁcantly
differed from reference. At this scale and larger,
landscape patterns examined in our study were found
to become increasingly homogenous, most likely due
to a lack of disturbance events, which allowed large,
contiguous forest canopies to persist. Our results point
to predominately low burn severity and limited re-
entry of wildﬁre leading to in minimal changes in
forest structure, such that large scale landscape
patterns are largely homogenized through continuous
canopy cover. At the current rate of multiple re-entries
in this landscape, low-severity ﬁre would take an
exceedingly long time to sufﬁciently alter forest
landscape pattern. Repeated, mixed-severity ﬁre or
mechanical treatments are needed to move forest
structure towards that of ecologically functioning
landscapes through the reduction of tree density,
which in turn alters the canopy and overall forest cover
patch patterns. However, these mechanisms largely do
not occur at rates sufﬁcient to alter landscape patterns
among the larger scales we examined. Understanding
the scale-dependent relationships of management
activities and ecological function with landscape

patterns is necessary to improve management out-
comes and ﬁre policy. Greater emphasis on the
restoration of forest structure across scales is needed
to provide for resilient, healthy ponderosa pine forests.
