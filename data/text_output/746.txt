ABSTRACT
since euro american

amerlean settlement fire exclusion and other factors have dramatically altered interior
western coniferous forests once open and parklike
present day structure inin many southwestern pinus ponderosa
forests consists of dense stands of young small diameter trees with small patches of larger old trees and relict open
bunchgrass

cantly lower A horizon ph and thicker 0 horizons than grass plots in general we found vegetation patches had statisti-
cally similar C and N concentrations and CN

differences in soil properties are attributed to
grasses being relatively higher quality sub-
strates for soil microflora low CN and lignin
N ratio higher ph and depositing more organic
matter at depth via their root systems com-
pared with deciduous and especially conifer-
ous trees meentemeyer 1978 anderson 1987
hart et al 1992 schimel et al 1994
almen-
dinger 1990 concluded that the magnitude of
these differences
particularly for soil organic
matter and total N increases the longer the
vegetation persists
forest soils also have lower phytolith

toliths
tolitha are particles of hydrated silica formed
in the cells of living plants and are liberated
upon decomposition because of the high silica
concentration of grasses compared with conif-
erous and deciduous trees
soils beneath per-
sistent grassland vegetation typically contain
significantly more phytoliths by mass than soils
beneath forest vegetation jones and beavers

STUDY SITE
the approximately 2 km2 study site is located
in northern arizona USA within the fort val-
ley experimental forest about 10 km north-
west of flagstaff this area has never been
logged and is presently excluded from live-
stock grazing although cattle and sheep graz-
ing did occur between 1876 and 1910 cov-

METHODS
six transects were chosen randomly from a
set of 20 intentionally selected to cross differ-
ent patches of vegetation along each transect
we established three 41 m2
ma 001 acre circular
plots for a total of 18 plots transects ranged
from 17 m to 26 m in length four transects
had the following 3 plot types
old growth
pine transition and dense younger pine here-
after old growthyoung transects the other 2
transects had the following 3 plot types
old
growth transition and grass hereafter old

we located plots on
relatively level terrain within the same soil

we chose our plot size to be
slightly smaller than the smallest patches of

lished in the center of the tree patch and all
transition plots were located just beyond the

open grassy areas that were also accessible in
the study area by heavy equipment used for

measured diameter at breast height

was selected because we wanted to sample
systematically only within the A horizon which
can be as shallow as 7 cm in some places in
the study area phytoliths are rarely found in
other genetic horizons
tree cores were mounted and sanded and
rings were counted using standard techniques

horizon and low soil C and N beneath grass
plots could be a result of more rapid decom-
position rates in these areas low levels of
nutrient accumulation can be characteristic of
rapid cycling rates
especially for more arid
and
arld
ecosystems schlesinger et al 1990
1990
in an area
adjacent to our study area
kaye and hart
1998a 1998b showed that mineral soil net N
mineralization
nitrification
and respiration
were significantly higher in patches of grass
compared to dense younger pine stands and
old growth tree stands open areas also have
higher solar radiation
soil temperature
and
soil moisture during the growing season than
dense pine dominated areas covington et al
1997
therefore low soil C and N accumula-
tion beneath our grass plots could be the
result of more rapid cycling rates of material
in these areas
interestingly phytolith
photolith
phytolith concentration was
similar between plots for both the 0 2 cm and
2 7 cm intervals the 0 2 cm interval probably
reflects the past 100 200 years fredlund and
tieszen 1994
and the 2 7 cm depth an older
association our results do not demonstrate
the dramatic differences in phytolith

tration previously reported from forest and

al
1987 and could indicate that grass cover
was more spatially continuous in the past this
interpretation is consistent with studies based
on fire history historical photos dendrochron-
ology and inference from population structure
cooper 1960 covington and moore 1994a
1994b covington et al 1997 fule
fulg et al 1997
all of which suggest that historical expansion
of ponderosa pine has occurred at the expense
of open grassy areas
in conclusion the major differences in soil
properties that we detected were significantly
lower A horizon ph values and thicker 0 hori-
zons for old growth plots than for grass and
dense younger pine plots lack of other statis-
tically significant results could be due to our low
sample size inherent variability in soils and
difficulty of truly isolating the tightly coupled
factors of soil genesis for example it is possi-
ble that potential effects of parent material and
soil texture have obscured organic matter pat-
terns derived from vegetation fine textured
smectitic soils derived from basalt parent mater-
ials have a high capacity to accumulate and
retain organic matter welch and klemmed-
son 1973 jenny 1980b nichols 1984
in an
ecosystem with coarser textured soils differ-
ences in soil properties due to vegetation may
be more pronounced this could also explain
why marked differences in soil properties were
found in many classic forest prairie transition
studies conducted in areas with recent glacial
parent materials yet welch and klemmedson
1975 reported greater C and N concentra-
tions in soils from grass openings compared to
