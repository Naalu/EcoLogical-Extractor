1. Introduction
Large herbivores often play a central role in determining the
structure and functioning of ecosystems through direct and
indirect effects of numerous activities including foraging, deposi-
tion of nutrients in dung and urine, and trampling of vegetation
and soils. Herbivores such as deer (Odocoileus sp.) and elk (Cervus
sp.) can affect survival, growth, and reproduction of individual
plants and thereby inﬂuence plant community composition
(Roininen et al., 1997; Dennis et al., 1998; Rambo and Faeth,
1999; Rooney and Waller, 2003; Huffman and Moore, 2003;
Goheen et al., 2007). These effects on vegetation may cascade
through ecosystems, impacting dynamics of other taxa such as
invertebrates and their associated food webs (Siemann et al.,
1998). For example, decreases in invertebrate abundance may
directly result when herbivores consume these organisms in the
process of foraging (Polis et al., 1989). In addition, invertebrates
may be indirectly affected through changes in the structure,
quantity, or quality vegetation (Stewart, 2001; Barrett and Stiling,
2007). Variations in arthropod assemblages are ultimately likely to
cascade through larger food webs (Danell and Huss-Danell, 1985;
Bailey and Whitham, 2003; Rooney and Waller, 2003). To date,
much research has addressed large herbivore effects on inverte-
brates by isolating and analyzing the factors individually (Rooney
and Waller, 2003). Few studies have used multivariate approaches
to examine herbivore–plant–invertebrate systems and analyze
multiple interactions. In this study, we modeled relationships of an
herbivore–plant–arthropod
system in ponderosa

Large herbivores have potential to affect invertebrate community structure through numerous
processes, but little work has been done to evaluate the relative importance of direct and indirect factors.
In this study, we measured arthropod community assemblages on Ceanothus fendleri A. Gray (Fendler’s
ceanothus) plants that were growing inside and outside of 4-m2 exclosures. We used univariate analyses
and structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate relationships within this herbivore–plant–
arthropod system in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forests of northern Arizona, USA. Results
showed that individual arthropod abundance, family diversity, family richness, and functional group
richness were signiﬁcantly greater on plots where C. fendleri plants were protected from large ungulate
herbivores (e.g., mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni)) than
on unprotected plots in each of the three study years. Results also indicated the following: (1) arthropod
abundance was signiﬁcantly greater on protected plants than unprotected plants; (2) rarefaction curves
suggested arthropod family richness was similar between protected and unprotected plants in two of the
three years when scaled by number of individuals but the estimated total richness was consistently
higher on protected plants; (3) arthropod abundance was directly affected by protection from
herbivores, plant stem length, and number of ﬂowers; (4) arthropod family richness was related to the
number of individuals collected and affected by stem length. Results from this study illustrate that
arthropod communities are directly affected by foraging vertebrate herbivores as well as indirectly
affected through complex plant-mediated factors in this model system. Protection of preferred forage
plants such as C. fendleri from ungulate herbivores can potentially increase diversity of arthropod
assemblages in these forests, help conserve biological diversity, and enhance ecosystem restoration
efforts.

19th century as a result of intensive livestock grazing of ﬁne
surface fuels of mainly grasses and forbs (Covington and Moore,
1994; Fule´ et al., 1997). Fire exclusion and reduced competition
with grasses in the understory favored tree seedling establish-
ment and allowed for unprecedented tree regeneration pulses
(Mast et al., 1999). Resulting dense forest conditions have led to
numerous conservation concerns including reduced production
and richness of understory plant communities and degradation
of
habitat
quality
for
vertebrate
and
invertebrate
species
dependent on understory communities (Covington and Moore,
1994; Waltz and Covington, 2004). In addition, Rocky Mountain
elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) were introduced in the early 20th
century to replace Merriam’s elk (Cervus elaphus merriami),
which were extirpated by uncontrolled hunting before 1910
(Allen, 1996; Truett, 1996). Concurrent with elk reintroduction
and management, predator control activities eliminated impor-
tant large carnivores in the region, such as wolves (Canis lupus
ssp.) and brown bears (Ursus arctos ssp.), by the mid 1900s
(Brown, 1983). Rocky Mountain elk have subsequently become
widespread and numerous in the forests of the Southwest (Allen,
1996). Overuse of forage resources in some locations suggests
that elk herbivory may be exacerbating understory community
degradation. Research on experimental restoration treatments
suggests that thinning overstory trees and reintroducing low
severity
ﬁre
increases
understory
production
as
well
as
invertebrate diversity (Waltz and Covington, 2004; Laughlin
et al., 2006; Moore et al., 2006). Protecting preferred forage
species from large herbivores during the forest restoration
process can allow plants to capitalize on increased resource
levels after tree thinning and increase size, complete life cycles,
and increase reproduction (Huffman, 2003). These changes can
in turn have effects on arthropod populations. In this study, we
modeled the relative importance of protection from large
herbivores and plant characteristics on arthropod abundance
and
family
richness.
We
selected
Ceanothus
fendleri
Gray
(Rhamnaceae; Fendler’s ceanothus) as our model system.
C. fendleri is a semi-evergreen, nitrogen ﬁxing shrub found in
ponderosa pine forests throughout the Rocky Mountains and
southwestern United States. In predominately herbaceous unders-
tories, the woody growth form of C. fendleri, being taller and more
persistent than co-occurring grasses and forbs, can enhance
structural
heterogeneity
and
habitat
diversity.
High-protein
content and palatability of the leaves of C. fendleri encourage
year-round browsing by elk, deer, and leporids (Conard et al.,
1985). Seeds, ﬂowers, and other vegetative parts provide resources
for various other animals including invertebrates (Huffman, 2006).
Because of its common occurrence in these forests and its
importance to both ungulate herbivores and arthropods, C. fendleri
provided a model system for studying large herbivore–inverte-
brate relationships.
In this study, we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to
investigate the relative importance of causal factors inﬂuencing
arthropod abundance and family richness. Evaluating hypoth-
eses that partition direct and indirect effects requires an analytic
framework that is designed to model multivariate relations
between system components (Grace, 2006). SEM is an extension
of regression and path analysis that can be used to model
multivariate relations and to evaluate multivariate hypotheses
(Bollen, 1989). The use of SEM has gained favor in recent years
due to its potential to increase understanding of complex
systems
(Shipley,
2000;
Grace,
2006).
In
turn,
resulting
information can be used to improve effectiveness of resource
conservation efforts. In this study, we asked the following
speciﬁc research questions: (1) Are arthropod abundance and
family richness on C. fendleri positively related to protection of
plants from large ungulate herbivores? (2) Does protection of C.
fendleri from ungulates increase diversity of arthropod func-
tional
groups?
(3)
Are
direct
effects
of
protection
more
important in determining arthropod abundance and richness
than indirect effects? (4) Is aerial stem length more important in
affecting changes in arthropod assemblage than number of
stems or number of ﬂowering stems? To answer these questions,
we developed a theoretical model of hypothesized causal
relationships
among
variables
in
this
ungulate
herbivore–
plant–arthropod system (Fig. 1).
2. Methods
2.1. Study site
This study was conducted on the Fort Valley Experimental
Forest (358 160 N, 1118 410 W) within the Coconino National Forest,
15 km NW of the city of Flagstaff in northern Arizona. Elevation of
the study site ranged from 2225 to 2380 m, with gentle rolling
topography and southerly slope gradients less than 15%. Annual
precipitation averages 520 mm, which falls in late summer as rain
from monsoonal thunderstorms and in winter as snow. Soils are of
basalt and volcanic origin and consist of a complex of ﬁne,
montmorillonitic, frigid Typic Argiborolls and mollic Eutroboralfs
(Covington et al., 1997). Overstory vegetation was nearly pure
ponderosa pine with an understory dominated by grasses, mainly
Festuca arizonica, Muhlenbergia montana and Elymus elymoides; a
variety of forbs, and a few shrubs such as C. fendleri and Rosa
woodsii. Domestic livestock were not present on the site and large

herbivores included mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and Rocky
Mountain elk. Although wolves and brown bears were no longer
present, mountain lions (Puma concolor), black bears (Ursus
americanus), coyotes (Canis latrans), and bobcats (Felis rufus) were
other potential predators occurring at the study site.
In 1998–1999, experimental ecosystem restoration treatments
were implemented at the study site. Treatments included thinning
trees in experimental forest units (14–16 ha in size) from
approximately 1490–1040 trees ha1 before treatment to 240–
140 trees ha1 post-treatment. Large and old trees (e.g., 35.7 cm
in diameter measured at 1.37 m above ground) were retained,
along with a limited number of smaller trees (for details regarding
treatment prescriptions, see Fule´ et al., 2001). Experimental units
were burned with prescribed ﬁre in 2000–2001. These treatments
were designed to address undesirable ecological conditions arising
from high tree densities, which in turn developed as a result of
early intensive livestock grazing and ﬁre exclusion (Moore et al.,
1999).
2.2. Experimental design
Our study was part of a larger experiment, initiated in 1999 to
examine responses of C. fendleri to experimental forest restoration
treatments (Huffman, 2003). For purposes of the experiment, C.
fendleri plots were established in three of the experimental forest
units described above. Sixty C. fendleri shrubs were located within
each of the three forest units for a total of 180 plants. Shrubs were
groups of 1–25 upright stems and generally covered an area less
than 2 m2. Centered on each shrub, we established a 1-m2 sample
plot. In each forest unit, 30 plots were randomly selected for
protection from large herbivores. Exclosures 4 m2 in area and
1.4 m in height were constructed around shrubs selected for
protection. A large mesh size of 5 cm  10 cm and open tops on the
exclosures allowed entry of small animals including birds and
invertebrates but excluded large ungulate herbivores. Exclosures
were constructed after overstory trees were thinned in 1999.
2.3. Plant and arthropod sampling
As part of the long-term study, yearly data from 1999–2004
were collected on the number of ﬂowering stems, total number of
stems and average stem lengths on C. fendleri plots. In June of years
2002, 2003, and 2004, we used sweep nets (39 cm diameter) to
sample invertebrate assemblages on the plots. In 2002, we
sampled all plots with live shrub individuals in two of the three
forest units (n = 52). In 2003 and 2004, we randomly selected 10
plots from each group, (protected and unprotected) within each of
the three forest units (n = 30). At each plot, nets were swept ﬁve
times through the plant stems at approximately 20–50 cm above
the ground. For plots with the majority of stems shorter than
50 cm, invertebrates were collected with aspirators in addition to
sweep nets; overall arthropod individuals collected with aspirators
represented very minor contributions to samples. Plot samples
were fumigated in jars containing ethyl acetate, and then
transferred to collection vials containing 70% isopropyl alcohol.
Samples were transported back to the lab where samples were
sorted. Insect arthropods were identiﬁed to family using Borror
et al. (1989). Ba´ldi (2003) has shown that family diversity is a good
surrogate measure of species diversity, particularly for large
arthropod groups (e.g., Coleoptera and Diptera). Specimens that
were difﬁcult to identify were sent to the USDA Systematic
Entomology Laboratory in Beltsville, MD. The only non-insect
arthropods captured in this study were in the order Araneae and
we did not attempt to identify these families. For analysis of
functional richness, we assigned insect arthropod families to
functional groups (e.g., predator, pollinator, herbivore, parasitoid,
omnivore, detritivore, scavenger, or unknown). We based this
categorization on general ecological information provided by
Borror et al. (1989); however, we acknowledge that some families
may represent multiple functional groups. All Araneae were
considered predators.
2.4. Univariate analyses
We analyzed effects of ungulate herbivory on arthropod
communities by comparing protected and unprotected plots in
terms of arthropod abundance (total individuals), family richness,
family diversity, functional group richness, and abundance of
individuals within functional groups. For each of the three study
years, variables were compared using a Wilcoxon two-sample
nonparametric test with JMP-IN 5.1 software (SAS, 2004). We did
not analyze time effects on dependent parameters since sample
plots were randomly selected each year and therefore were not
suitable for repeated measures analysis. To calculate family
diversity,
we
used
Shannon’s
diversity
index
(H0)
where:
H0 = Spi logepi and pi is the proportion of the total number of
arthropods represented by family i divided by the total number of
arthropods (Price, 1997). To account for relationships between
family richness and number of individuals captured, we compared
Coleman rarefaction curves (Coleman, 1981), plotted for protected
and unprotected plots in each of the three study years, as suggested
by Gotelli and Colwell (2001). In addition, we estimated total
family richness using the Michaelis–Menten function (Colwell and
Coddington, 1994). These analyses were performed using Esti-
mateS, Version 8.0 (Colwell, 2006).
2.5. Structural equation modeling
To examine the relative importance of herbivore protection and
plant characteristics on arthropod assemblages, we used observed
variable SEM (Bollen, 1989). We examined bivariate plots for the
presence of outliers, evidence of skewness or kurtosis, and
nonlinear relationships. We acknowledge that not all causal
processes that act in this system are represented in Fig. 1. Rather,
our objective was to determine whether the data were consistent
with the expectations of the proposed model. Ultimately, the goal
was to arrive at a model consistent with the data using the fewest
modiﬁcations of the initial hypothesized model as possible,
thereby preserving the ability to draw inferences from model
parameters. The ﬁnal structural equation model describes a
covariance structure that is consistent with the covariance
structure of the dataset; theory, then, guides our interpretation
of the mechanistic nature of the directional paths.
Our
initial
model
included
squared
terms
of
arthropod
abundance and shrub stem length because bivariate scatter plots
indicated second-order polynomial relationships to other variables
in the model. However, only signiﬁcant squared terms were
retained in the ﬁnal model. Robust maximum likelihood solution
procedures were used and we relied on chi-square goodness of ﬁt
measures to evaluate model adequacy (note that large P-values
(>0.05) imply no statistical difference between model and data).
The degrees of freedom when using robust maximum likelihood
estimators are estimated according to a formula given in the Mplus
Technical Appendices (Muthen and Muthen, 2005). Residuals and
modiﬁcation indices were also examined to determine if there
were obvious model-data discrepancies. Analyses were performed
using Mplus software (Muthen and Muthen, 2005). For simplicity,
we evaluated the model using data collected in 2003, which was a
nearer-normal year for spring precipitation (53% of 30-year
average, January–June) compared to 2002 (12% of average) and
2004 (44% of average) (WRCC, 2007). Finally, we calculated the
standardized ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ effects, the sum of which equals
D.W. Huffman et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 258 (2009) 616–625
618

the ‘total effects’ of a factor on a response (Grace, 2006).
Coefﬁcients were standardized by converting them into units of
standard deviations. Indirect effects equal the total sum of the
products of all path coefﬁcients from a predictor to richness. Direct
effects are the individual coefﬁcients in the model. Total effects are
a simple summary of the complex relationship between the factors
and arthropod family richness and they provide a calculation of the
net effect (i.e., strength and sign) of a relationship. Standardized
direct, indirect, and total effects range from 1 to +1.
3. Results
3.1. Comparison of protected and unprotected plots
A total of 13 orders and 65 families were collected during the
three-year period (Appendix A). Families in the Coleoptera,
Diptera, Hemiptera, Homoptera, and Hymenoptera orders were
found in each of the three sample years on plots protected from
large ungulate herbivores. Similarly, Diptera, Homoptera, and
Hymenoptera were found on unprotected plots each year. Of the
ﬁve most abundant families collected in each of the three years,
protected and unprotected plots had 2–3 of these in common
(Table 1). In all years, individual arthropod abundance, family
diversity, family richness, and functional group richness were
signiﬁcantly greater on protected plots than on unprotected plots
(Table 2). Herbivore arthropods were the most abundant and
frequent functional group, comprising on average 63% of the
individuals captured and occurring on more than 50% of the plots.
In this functional group, sapsuckers in the orders Homoptera
(Auchenorrhyncha and Sternorrhyncha suborders) and Hemiptera,
and chewers in the order Coleoptera, were consistently abundant
(Table 1). Predators were second most abundant followed by
omnivores, pollinators, and parasitoids, respectively. Twenty
percent of the arthropods were identiﬁed as having a strong
relationship with ﬂowers, either as pollinators or ﬂorivores.
Herbivores and omnivores were more abundant on protected
plots than unprotected plots in all three years. Predator and
parasitoid arthropods were more abundant on protected plots in
2003 and 2004, while pollinators were more abundant on
protected plots only in 2003 (Table 2).
Rarefaction curves showed no difference in family richness
between protected and unprotected plots at similar numbers of
captured arthropod individuals in 2002 and 2003 (Fig. 2). In 2004,
family richness was signiﬁcantly greater on protected plots than
unprotected plots when scaled by number of individuals captured.
Total estimated family richness in all three study years was higher
on protected plots than unprotected plots (Fig. 2).
Arthropod
family
richness
exhibited
signiﬁcant
bivariate
relationships with all ﬁve factors tested in the model (Fig. 3).
Richness exhibited nonlinear positive relationships with arthropod
abundance and number of ﬂowering stems, and richness exhibited
positive linear relationships with number of stems, stem length,
and protection from herbivores (Fig. 3).
3.2. Structural equation model
The initial model (Fig. 1) described the multivariate relations in
the data well (x2 = 6.2, 3 d.f., P = 0.10). Inclusion of a direct path
from protection to arthropod family richness was not signiﬁcant,
despite the signiﬁcant univariate relationship (Fig. 3). However,
the addition of a pathway from stem length to arthropod family
richness was signiﬁcant and this ﬁnal model ﬁt the data well
(Fig. 4; x2 = 5.8, 3 d.f., P = 0.12). Evaluations of standardized total
effects (Table 3) suggest that protection from ungulate herbivory
indirectly increased arthropod family richness (standardized total
effects coefﬁcient = 0.56).
The SEM analysis yielded the following three results: (1)
arthropod family richness was indirectly affected by protection
from browsing of C. fendleri, (2) arthropod family richness
exhibited a positive yet nonlinear relationship with arthropod
abundance and was weakly positively affected by stem length, (3)
arthropod abundance was inﬂuenced most strongly by a direct,
positive effect of protection from browsing and secondarily by
indirect effects through changes in structural characteristics (stem
length and number of ﬂowering stems) of C. fendleri.
4. Discussion
4.1. Effects of ungulate herbivory on arthropod assemblages
In each of the three years of our study, we found greater
arthropod abundance and family richness on shrubs that were
protected from ungulates. Rarefaction curves showed that high
observed family richness on protected plots was related to greater
numbers
of
arthropod
individuals
collected
on
these
plots
compared with unprotected plots. Indeed, when scaled by number

of arthropod individuals collected, observed family richness was
greater on protected plots only in 2004. However, estimated total
richness was higher for protected plots in all years. These results
suggest that, in addition to number of individuals occurring,
arthropod family richness was also affected by differences in plant
characteristics between protected and unprotected plots. Because
we did not identify arthropods below the level of family, species
richness was likely underestimated in this study. However, general
patterns we found regarding family richness are likely to hold true
at ﬁner taxonomic resolution (Ba´ldi, 2003).
Numerous factors inﬂuence plant responses to herbivory, and
these responses may indirectly affect arthropod communities. In
some cases, herbivory can stimulate ﬂower production or enhance
plant growth. For example, Paige and Whitham (1987) reported
increased ﬂower production of Ipomopsis aggregata after experi-
mental clipping as well as natural herbivory by deer and elk.
Similarly, Throop and Fay (1999) found that browsed Ceanothus
herbaceous produced a greater number of inﬂorescences than
unbrowsed plants on a tallgrass prairie site. In contrast, intensive
herbivory on other species can reduce growth and reproduction.
For example, Huffman and Moore (2003) found that unprotected C.
fendleri plants had signiﬁcantly shorter aerial stems, fewer stems,
and lower rates of ﬂowering than protected plants in the ﬁrst few
years following implementation of ponderosa pine forest restora-

tion treatments. Similar results have been described for other
ecosystems. Stein et al. (1992) noted that elk completely consumed
Salix lasiolepis resprouts after plants were experimentally burned.
Strohmeyer and Maschinski (1996) reported both wild and
domestic herbivores reduced total shoot length and number of
branches of S. arizonica. This indicates that indirect effects on
arthropods, as mediated by plant characteristics, are dependent
upon intensity of vertebrate herbivory.
In other forest ecosystems, intense ungulate herbivory has been
shown to have strong indirect effects on arthropod community
characteristics (see Stewart, 2001 for a review). In our study,
protected plots had a greater number of arthropod functional
groups, and thus apparently more complex arthropod food webs,
than unprotected plants. Resources provided by the plant host
attract and sustain primary arthropod consumers as well as
detritivores, which in turn provide resources for secondary
arthropod consumers. These effects have potential to cascade
through the ecosystem and inﬂuence food web dynamics at coarser
scales. For example, at another forested study site in the
southwestern U.S., insectivorous birds were found to beneﬁt from
increased insect diversity on aspen (Populus tremuloides) trees that
were protected from elk herbivory (Bailey and Whitham, 2003).
Still
further,
such
herbivore-induced
changes
in
arthropod
communities may ultimately affect basic ecosystem function as
arthropods represent signiﬁcant pathways for energy transfer and
material ﬂow (Kim, 1993).
4.2. Herbivore–plant–arthropod relationships
Our model explained 89% of the variation in arthropod richness
by differentiating direct and indirect relationships with factors that
may be driving arthropod community diversity. Arthropod family
richness increased asymptotically with number of arthropods
captured (Gotelli and Colwell, 2001). Our model showed 32% of
the variation in arthropod abundance was explained by the
combined inﬂuence of ﬂowering stems, stem length, and protection
from browsing. A factor affecting both arthropod abundance and
richness was stem length. The plant vigor hypothesis (Price, 1991)
predicts greater insect herbivory on faster growing plant modules or
those that have grown fast enough to become relatively large (Price,
1991; Cornelissen et al., 2008). Although plant vigor may have
inﬂuenced patterns observed in this study, we did not assess plant
growth rates, nor did we analyze a reduced model that only included
herbivorous
arthropods.
Future
work
could
directly
explore
relationshipsbetween plantgrowthratesandarthropodassemblage
characteristics. In addition, the larger size of the plant likely makes it
more apparent and easier to locate on the landscape by arthropods.
Numbers of stems and stem length positively affected number
of ﬂowering stems. In turn, number of ﬂowering stems and stem
length showed similar importance in affecting arthropod abun-
dance. This indicates that abundant and diverse host resources are
as important in this system as plant module size in attracting or
sustaining arthropod populations (Lawton, 1983). In our study,
20% of the sampled arthropods were either considered pollinators
or their diet consisted mainly of ﬂower parts. Marques et al. (2000)
found that 32% of the variation in arthropod herbivores was
explained by ﬂower biomass alone. Surprisingly, the number of
ﬂowering stems in our study was not signiﬁcantly related to
arthropod family richness.
Direct effects of plant protection from ungulates showed the
strongest inﬂuence on arthropod abundance. It is well known that
arthropods living in fruits, ﬂowers, leaves and seeds can be
consumed as larger vertebrates forage (Polis et al., 1989; Gomez
and Gonzalez-Megias, 2002; Bonal and Munoz, 2007). Our results
support those of other studies which have documented such direct
effects to be quite large (60–80% of the population in one study)
and detrimental to the arthropod community (Gomez and
Gonzalez-Megias, 2002).
4.3. Implications
Complex ecological relationships can be better understood
through the use of multivariate techniques such as SEM. Our model
indicated that large herbivores affected diversity of arthropod
assemblages directly, as well as indirectly through variations in C.
fendleri characteristics. Although beyond the scope of our study, it
is plausible that large herbivore effects on arthropod assemblages
may in turn cascade through the ecosystem and inﬂuence other
functional properties (see Hooper et al., 2005 for a review). These
effects may constrain efforts to reestablish structural character-
istics and functional properties in degraded ecosystems (Opper-
man and Merenlender, 2000). Prior to Euro-American settlement,
Merriam’s elk was thought to be a locally uncommon species in
northern Arizona and New Mexico (Allen, 1996; Truett, 1996). Elk
populations
were
historically
limited
by
forage
conditions,
weather patterns, water availability, Native American hunters,

and large predators such as wolves and brown bears (Brown,
1983; Truett, 1996). Since their reintroduction in the early 20th
century, populations of elk in northern Arizona have grown to
about 30,000 adults (Ballard et al., 2000). Elk at our study site
were not limited by large predators, and water catchments occur
at various locations on the landscape. Ballard et al. (2000)
concluded that elk survival rates in northern Arizona suggested
expanding populations. In contrast, mule deer populations, after
increasing in the early to mid 1900s, have recently declined
(Clements and Young, 1997). Management actions that reduce
intensive ungulate herbivory during the early stages of forest
restoration when forage resources are limited may help to
conserve biological diversity and ecological integrity. Although
protection
of
plants
by
using
fenced
exclosures
may
be
impractical, other techniques such as manipulation of water
sources and strategic location of natural impediments (e.g., tree
falls, thinning debris) may prove to be effective approaches for
controlling herbivore movement and related browsing impacts
on desirable species (Reynolds, 1966; Severson and Medina,
1983). Additionally, reintroduction of large carnivores such as
wolves may help restore food web complexity and biodiversity
in these ecosystems (Ripple and Beschta, 2004). Further work
that
examines
ungulate
herbivore
effects
on
multitrophic
interactions and ecosystem function will help land managers
formulate sound approaches for restoration and stewardship of
these forests.
