Background 
46 
 
47 
 
Fire plays an integral role in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)-dominated 
48 
forests by regulating and maintaining tree density, understory species abundance and 
49 
composition, litter accumulation, and many ecosystem processes (Weaver, 1951; 
50 
Cooper, 1960; Hart et al., 2005; Laughlin and Fulé, 2008). Starting in the late 1800s 
51 
ponderosa pine forests were heavily grazed by livestock, reducing the fine fuels that 
52 
carried surface fires through the system. In the early twentieth century, active fire 
53 
suppression further reduced the acreage burned each year (Cooper, 1960; Covington 
54 
and Moore, 1994). As a result, these forests have become densely stocked with 
55 
ponderosa pine trees and are often depauperate of understory species. The increased 
56 
density of trees, coupled with changes in climate, has led to a commensurate increase 
57 
in the number of hectares burned annually by wildfire (Swetnam, 1990; Covington et 
58 
al., 1997; Westerling et al., 2006). In addition, more land is treated each year for fuels 
59 
management with prescribed fire (Interagency Fire Center; www.NIFC.gov), often in 
60 
combination with mechanical tree thinning prior to burning. Disturbances created by 
61 
these treatments may facilitate the spread of undesirable non-native plant species 
62 
(hereafter non-natives) into the burned landscapes (D'Antonio and Vitousek, 1992; 
63 
Keeley, 2006). Regardless of whether the fire is prescribed or wild, non-natives are 
64 
frequently documented in the post-fire understory community of ponderosa pine 
65 
forests. 
66 
 
Many non-natives are well adapted to fire (D'Antonio and Vitousek, 1992; 
67 
Brooks et al., 2004) and are generally considered an undesirable component of the 
68 
post-fire plant community (Allen et al., 2002; D'Antonio and Meyerson, 2002). They 
69 
are often early successional species that can capitalize on open niches created by fire 
70 
faster than their native counterparts (Rejmanek, 1995). The impact of non-natives in 
71 
the post-fire community is highly variable. Some species, such as prickly lettuce 
72 
(Lactuca serriola) and common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), tend to have a 
73 
subordinate role in the disturbed ecosystem. More aggressive invaders, such as 
74 
cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), can dominate an ecosystem, changing herbaceous 
75 
diversity, fire cycles, and belowground processes (Whisenant, 1990; Knapp, 1996; 
76 
Evans et al., 2001; Belnap et al., 2005). 
77 
 
Increasingly, thinning and burning treatments are implemented with a focus on 
78 
ecological restoration in addition to fuels reduction. While ecological restoration 
79 
treatments are intended to reinvigorate all aspects of forest health, including the native 
80 
understory community, there is a growing concern among land managers, scientists, 
81 
and other stakeholders about the risk of encroachment by non-natives into these 
82 
systems (Moore et al., 1999; Allen et al., 2002).  Implementation of ecological 
83 
restoration usually involves an elevated level of disturbance.  Prescribed fire, 
84 
mechanical removal of excess trees, and seeding with native species are common 
85 
restoration practices which can perturb the soil and disturb vegetation (D'Antonio and 
86 
Meyerson, 2002).  The disturbances generated by thinning and burning treatments can 
87 
create openings for the invasion of highly competitive non-native species (Hobbs and 
88 
Huenneke, 1992). 
89 
Research has shown that areas burned in wildfires can be more susceptible to 
90 
nonnative invasion than those burned in prescribed fires (Crawford et al., 2001; 
91 
Griffis et al., 2001, Keeley et al., 2003).  Other evidence suggests that past and 
92 
present land management practices, overall level of disturbance on the site, and 
93 
proximity to invasive species seed sources can be more important in determining the 
94 
likelihood of invasion.  Research in the Southwest has shown high levels of non-
95

native invasion in prescribed slash pile burns with long residence time (Korb et al., 
96 
2004).  Conversely, low levels of plant invasion were detected within the perimeters 
97 
of wildfires in remote areas with comparatively little anthropogenic disturbance 
98 
(Laughlin et al., 2004). 
99 
 
While there have been many studies examining non-native response to 
100 
wildfires and prescribed burning, both with and without thinning, there has been no 
101 
comprehensive systematic review of non-native encroachment into ponderosa pine 
102 
forests throughout the native range of these forests. Land management agencies are 
103 
expected to minimize the spread of non-natives into public lands. It is, therefore, 
104 
important that information be available to practitioners about the risk of non-native 
105 
invasion in response to thinning and burning treatments compared to wildfires. In this 
106 
review we will examine levels of non-native invasion in response to thinning and 
107 
burning treatments in ponderosa pine forests through North America. We will then 
108 
compare these results to levels of invasion reported in wildfires. Lastly, we will look 
109 
for common factors in thinned and burned areas and wildfire areas that did not 
110 
experience high levels of non-native invasion.

Objective of the Review 
114 
 
115 
2.1 
Primary question 
116 
 
 
117 
 
Do tree thinning and prescribed fire treatments commonly lead to 
118 
elevated non-native plant establishment in ponderosa pine forests? 
119 
 
120 
2.2 
Secondary question (if applicable) 
121 
 
122 
 
How does non-native plant encroachment into areas treated with 
123 
thinning and burning compare to encroachment into areas burned in wildfire? 
124 
 
125 
 
Are there consistencies among areas that are not invaded by non-
126 
natives after wildfire and/or thinning and burning treatments? 
127 
 
128 
 
Is there a difference in long-term persistence of non-native species 
129 
after wildfire versus after thinning and burning?

Study inclusion criteria  
159 
 Relevant subject(s): Ponderosa pine-dominated forests that have 
160 
been treated with tree thinning and prescribed burning or have 
161 
burned in wildfires. 
162 
 Types of intervention:  
163 
o Tree thinning and prescribed burning 
164 
o Burned in wildfire 
165 
 Types of comparator: 
166 
o Thinned and burned v. no treatment 
167 
o Wildfire v. unburned 
168 
o Thinned and burned v. wildfire 
169 
o Heavy invasion v. slight or no invasion 
170 
 Types of outcome: 
171 
o Cover of non-native plants 
172 
o Biomass of non-native plants 
173 
o Non-native species richness 
174 
o Relative abundance of non-natives compared to total 
175 
abundance 
176 
o Persistence of non-natives after disturbance 
177 
 Types of study: Studies reporting non-native establishment in 
178 
treated or burned areas and untreated or unburned areas. We will 
179 
prioritize replicated studies with predisturbance data, although this 
180 
may not be feasible for wildfire studies. Observational studies, 
181 
expert opinion, and anecdotal reports will only be considered in 
182 
exceptional cases. 
183 
 
184 
3.3 
Potential reasons for heterogeneity: 
185 
There is tremendous variability in ponderosa pine forests across the native 
186 
range of the species. Heterogeneity is driven by latitudinal and elevational differences 
187 
in forests, management history, and historical levels of disturbance. Additionally, 
188 
there is typically a high level of variability in burn severity within a single wildfire.  
189 
Understory response to thinning and burning treatments can vary depending on 
190 
thinning intensity, prefire fuel loads, and season of burn. Lastly, there is not 
191 
ubiquitous agreement on the nativity of some species (i.e. Poa pratensis). When 
192 
possible, we will adjust all data to be consistent with nativity as listed in the USDA 
193

194 
the original authors’ determination of which species are non-native.

Study quality assessment 
197 
Studies will be evaluated based on the types of methodology comparator, with 
198 
the greatest weight given to replicated, randomized experiments.

3.5 
Data extraction strategy 
201 
 
All studies included at full text will be read by two members of the review 
202 
panel. We will compare the level of agreement on study inclusion between reviewers 
203 
using Kappa analysis. We will assemble review information in a master spreadsheet, 
204 
recording qualitative and quantitative aspects of the studies. Key variables 
205 
include non-native plant cover, non-native biomass, non-native species richness, and 
206 
the contribution of non-native species to the total understory for all variables. 
207 
 
208 
3.6 
Data synthesis and presentation 
209 
 
Data synthesis will be done by the review panel after reading the studies. We 
210 
will assemble basic data about the studies reviewed (e.g., number of studies identified 
211 
in the search, number and percent deemed relevant for review, distribution of 
212 
geographic locations and information type). We will focus on studies reporting a 
213 
quantitative response in non-native vegetation to wildfire or thinning and burning. 
214 
Assuming we have sufficient studies with comparable data, we will use meta-
215 
analytical methods to test the data. Lastly, we will draw inferences about the similar 
216 
and different non-native response to thinning and burning versus wildfire and 
217 
highlight areas where further research is needed.
