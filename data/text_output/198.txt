ABSTRACT 
Dieterich, J.H., 1983. Fire history of southwestern mixed conifer: a case study. For. Ecol., 
Manage., 6: 13--31. 
Prior to the year 1900, fires burned through a mixed conifer stand located in the 
South Fork of Thomas Creek, in the White Mountains of Arizona, at an interval of 22 
years. Small fires burned on the area at more frequent intervals. In the absence of these 
periodic fires, species diversity remains high but stand composition and structure appears 
to be changing. 
INTRODUCTION 
The mixed conifer forests of the Southwest, while small in areal extent 
(2.5 million acres or 1 million ha), are an important ecosystem in terms of 
water yield, recreational opportunities, wildlife habitat, forage production 
for domestic livestock, and timber production. The large number of tree spe- 
cies present in this biotic community establishes the type as one of the rich- 
est in terms of species diversity of any in the western United States. Jones 
{1974) described the southwestern mixed conifer in terms of species associa- 
tion as being stands that are made up of from two, to as many as eight, spe- 
cies growing on the same area. In a discussion of the problem of ecosystem 
classification he states: 
A complete ecosystem classification for forest management would consist of separate 
classifications defining habitat types, stand types, land systems, and aquatic systems... 
Each looks at a different aspect of the total ecosystem, to fill the total management need. 
A consideration of equal importance to ecosystem classification is deter- 
mining the pattern of past natural disturbances that have influenced develop- 
ment of the ecosystem. In this instance: What is the role that historical fire 
(pr~1900) has played in the shaping of the mixed conifer ecosystem as it ex- 
ists today; and what are the management implications of this discovery? 
Wagener (1961), in attempting to describe his rationale for expanding fire 
history studies in the Sierra Nevada forests of California, said: 

14 
History, whether of populations of humans or of trees, is significant chiefly for the un- 
derstanding that it may provide of the conditions and environments under which these 
populations existed over a span of time, and for the wisdom that this understanding may 
yield in the guidance of future actions and policies. 
The fire history study described here provides the first detailed documen- 
tation of the role that fire has played in the development of the mixed coni- 
fer type in the White Mountains, east~central Arizona. Several decades have 
passed since the last major fire on the study area. The record of fire frequen- 
cy and the ecosystem changes that have occured as a result of excluding fire 
from the area provide the land manager with resource response information 
that should not only improve treatment prescriptions but should result in 
more effective land management planning as well. 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
The term "mixed conifer" is imprecise unless tied specifically to geograph- 
ical region, elevation, climatic conditions, and species association. For exam- 
ple, fire history studies have been conducted in the mixed conifer-pinegrass 
community type of the Blue Mountains of Oregon (Hall, 1977); in the pon- 
derosa pine (Pinus ponderosa )-mixed conifer forests along the Colorado 
Front Range by Barrows et al. (1977) and Laven et al. (1980); in the sequ- 
oia-mixed conifer forests in the Sierra Nevada, California (Kilgore and Tay- 
lor, 1979); in the mixed conifer forests of the Canadian Rockies (Tande, 
1979); in the mixed conifer forests of the northern Rocky Mountains (Hous- 
ton, 1973; Arno, 1980; Davis, 1980); and in the ponderosa pine-white fir (A- 
hies concolor) forests in Crater Lake National Park (McNeil and Zobel, 
1980). Each of these studies reflect different fire intervals. Each ecosystem 
described in these studies responds differently to fire and to programs de- 
signed to protect it from fire. Although there are exceptions, two tree spe- 
cies stand out as being more or less common to most of these mixed conifer 
stands: Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga rnenziesii) and ponderosa pine. 
There is only one reference available on fire history in southwestern mix- 
ed conifer. Ahlstrand (1980), reporting on a fire history study in the Guada- 
lupe Mountains National Park in southwestern Texas, sampled 48 specimens 
of southwestern white pine (Pinus strobiformis) in a 1800-ha mixed conifer 
stand at an elavation of from 2150 to 2250 m. He found that fires of various 
sizes had occured on the study area in at least 71 of the 426 years (1554-- 
1980), for a mean fire interval for all fires of about once every 6 years. Major 
fires, or fires in which 20% or more of the samples alive at the time of the 
fire were scarred, occured on 14 occasions between 1696 and 1922. The ma- 
jor fire interval ranged from 6 to 30 years, the mean being one fire every 17 
years. This fire interval corresponds favorably with findings from the study 
being reported on here -- the mean fire interval for fires covering the water- 
shed being 22 years.

STUDY AREA 
The Thomas Creek Experimental Watersheds (Fig. 1) are part of an exten- 
sive block of mixed conifer forests in east-central Arizona. The watersheds 
were established in 1963 to measure water and sediment yields resulting 
from various silvicultural practices. Subsequently the study objectives were 
broadened to include testing of resource response models and management 
practices in mixed conifer forests of the Southwest (Rich and Thompson, 
1974). 
There had been no logging disturbance on the Thomas Creek area prior to 
a prescribed cutting operation in 1978--79. This made it particularly desir- 
able as a site for collecting fire history specimens because none of the old- 
growth trees harboring fire scars had been removed. 
The North Fork of Thomas Creek encompasses 189 ha and is currently 
being retained as the control watershed (Fig. 1). The South Fork contains 
227 ha, 166 ha of which was treated with a group selection and group shel- 
terwood cutting prescription. A portion of the watershed remained untreat- 
ed because slopes were too steep to permit logging by conventional tractor 
methods. The fire history specimens were taken from the 166-ha portion 
where trees were removed in the cutting treatment. This is an area roughly 
1.6 km long by 1.1 km wide. 
Moir and Ludwig (1979) provide a site-specific description of the mixed 
conifer habitat type found in the Thomas Creek drainage. They place it in 
the Picea pungens series (Picea pungens -- Picea engelmannii/Senecio carda- 
mine habitat type) and identify it as the Abies concolor phase, with light 
densities present of both Picea pungens and Pinus strobiformis. Pinus pon- 
derosa is included as an infrequent seral species. 
The dominant timber species on the South Fork are Douglas-fir and white 
fir, making up about 48% of the total trees and 55% of the basal area, 43.6 
m 2/ha (Core Study Plan, Thomas Creek Resource Evaluation Project, USDA 
For. Serv. Rocky Mount. For. Range Exp. Stn., RM-2108, April 1975). 
Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) accounts for 22% of the stocking, and 
ponderosa pine, 11%. Ponderosa pine makes up about 15% of the overstory 
and about one third of the stand volume. However, it is poorly represented 
in the smaller size classes, indicating that regeneration has been difficult in a 
stand dominated by more shade-tolerant species. Additional species repre- 
sented in the stand include Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), blue 
spruce (Picea pungens), corbark fir {Abies lasiocarpa var. arizonica), and 
southwestern white pine. 
Elevations on the study area vary from 2682 to 2774 m. Annual precipita- 
tion has averaged about 740 mm since 1959 and has varied from 510 to 
1090 mm (Rich and Thompson, 1974). Nearly 50% of the anual precipita- 
tion comes during fall, winter, and spring; the remainder comes during the 
summer months in the form of thunderstorms.

Past research provides a reliable basis for describing the fuels on the Tho- 
mas Creek Experimental Watersheds. Prior to logging, a downed woody fuel 
inventory, using techniques described by Brown (1974), was conducted on 
both North and South Thomas. Both watersheds averaged nearly 65 t/ha of 
dead woody fuel based on a total of 120 individual transects (Fuels Manage- 
ment Project, USDA For. Serv. Rocky Mount. For. Range Exp. Stn., RM- 
2108). This woody fuel inventory provides only a portion of the story. De- 
tailed fuel inventories in the mixed conifer type on the Apache-Sitgreaves 
National Forest where the Thomas Creek watersheds are located indicated 
that, in addition to the woody material, fuel loadings in the L (litter), F (fer- 
mentation), and H (humus) layers averaged an additional 55 t/ha, of which 
about 38 t/ha was in the H layer (Sackett, 1980). Combining the measure- 
ments of woody fuels with the forest floor material provided a realistic esti- 
mate of total combustible material -- 120 t/ha -- on the Thomas Creek wa- 
terdsheds. This is comparable to the average fuel loading of 133 t/ha for nine 
other mixed conifer stands on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest (Sack- 
ett, 1980). 
METHODS 
Specimen collection 
Prior to logging the area in 1978, but after the trees had been marked for 
cutting, a survey was made of the fire-scarred trees on South Thomas to lo- 
cate the most desirable trees to use as fire history specimens and to insure 
that all portions of the watershed would be represented by one or more 
fire-scarred trees. 
Each fire history tree was felled to prevent damage to the scar, and an ad- 
ditional 10--15 cm was left on the stump so that a cross section suitable 
for analysis could be subsequently removed. 
The first samples were collected in December 1977. Logging proceeded 
slowly over the next 2 years and sample collections were made in July 1978, 
and again in July 1979 when the final collection was made. Originally, 27 
trees were designated as fire history specimens, but the final collection in- 
cluded 35 specimens, four of which were later found to be undatable pri- 
marily because of growth ring complacency. Location of the fire history trees 
used in the study is shown in Fig. 1. 
The majority of the trees collected for analysis were old.growth ponderosa 
pine. However, six southwestern white pine were included in the collection 
to use as a basis for comparing the susceptibility of scarring of this species 
to that of ponderosa pine. One dead snag (No. 28) was used in a group anal- 
ysis of a cluster of trees. Another specimen collected had no identifying 
mark or location description so it does not appear on the map in Fig. 1. 
However, it is included as No. 31 in the Master Fire Chronology (MFC) be- 
cause it contained 14 scars, three of which corresponded with dates of major 
fires occurring in 1819, 1847, and 1893.

Fig. 2. South Thomas Creek Master Fire Chronology. Fire dates extended from 1608 to 1911. Records of major fire years are strongly 
reinforced in 1893, 1873, 1847, 1819, and 1806. Although less material was available for analysis prior to 1800, evidence of major fire 
years appear in 1789, 1773, 1748, and 1716.

Specimen preparation and dating 
Some of the cross sections had been cut with a crosscut saw, simplifying 
surfacing. Chain saw cuts, because of their roughness, required more effort 
to prepare an adequate surface for dating. Final surfacing, cross<lating, and 
verification of the specimens was done by the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Re- 
search, University of Arizona, Tucson (Stokes and Smiley, 1968). The stan- 
dard procedure for dating each specimen is to have one person inspect the 
cross section, identify the fire scars, and date the specimen and the fire scars, 
using an established chronology or a chronology developed for the specific 
site. A second person independently checks these same data, and differences 
in interpretation of fire scars or specific dates are resolved. 
There are three established chronologies that are appropriate to use for 
cross-dating the Thomas Creek samples (Drew, 1972): Alpine, Arizona 
{#191000), 2743 m, Douglas-fir; Luna, New Mexico (#192000), 2591 m, 
Douglas-fir; and Luna, New Mexico (#176640), 2332 m, ponderosa pine. To 
further ensure precise dating, a composite skeleton plot (Stokes and Smiley, 
1968) was developed specifically for South Thomas Creek by securing incre- 
ment cores from trees on the watershed. 
Although analysis and interpretation of physical fire-scar evidence was 
done by experienced dendrochronologists, there were a number of questions 
concerning precise dating that remained unresolved and need explanation. As 
described below, an attempt was made to treat these uncertainties logically 
and uniformly, and to so indicate these situations in the Master Fire Chro- 
nology {Fig. 2). 
It is difficult to establish a precise date for a scar that is a result of a late 
fall or early spring fire. If the fire occurs during the dormant season, the fire 
scar will probably appear on the boundary between the latewood cells of one 
season's growth and the earlywood cells of the next. In this case, the fire is 
identified as having occurred in the same year as the formation of the early- 
wood cells. The possibility remains, however, that the fire actually occured 
during the fall of the previous year after cessation of growth of the latewood 
cells. Examples are tree 19 -- fire date 1700; and tree 11 -- fire dates 1716 
and 1722 (Fig. 2). 
Occasionally the dendrochronologist may encounter a fire scar that can- 
not be positively dated but is obviously an "either-or" situation. For exam- 
ple, the date is either 1876 or 1877, and it is certain that it is not 1875. In 
this instance, the scar is so indicated on the MFC, as shown, for example, in 
specimen 12, dates 1752 (3) and 1773 (4). This provides an opportunity for 
the analyst interpreting the MFC to make a logical choice of the fire date. 
For example, specimen 1 shows a fire date of 1892 with an alternate date of 
1893; specimen 2 shows a fire date of 1893 with an alternate date of 1894. 
An inspection of the MFC shows good agreement between several specimens 
of an 1893 fire that probably covered most of the watershed. Therefore it 
would be logical to accept the 1893 date for specimen 2, and perhaps for 

20 
specimen 1 as well. However, it would have been possible to have had a small 
lightning fire create a scar on specimen 1 on the year prior to the 1893 area- 
wide burn. On the other hand, it would have been much less likely for a fire 
to have occurred anywhere on the watershed in 1894 -- the year following 
the area-wide burn. So, in this instance, a logical choice between the two 
dates (1893 and 1894) would be 1893. 
RESULTS 
Once these dating irregularities are resolved, it becomes possible to look at 
the MFC and attempt to interpret the display of fire history data. 
Although twelve of the specimens dated back prior to 1700, only two fire 
dates were identified in the 1600's (1627 (6) and 1648). The majority of the 
fire dates were recorded during the 200-year period 1700--1900. There is a 
sharp reduction in the number of fires occurring on the area after 1900. 
The most obvious characteristic of the MFC is the fire interval pattern re- 
corded during the 19th century. There is strong evidence for concluding that 
South Thomas Creek burned over five times during this period (1806, 1819, 
1847, 1873, and 1893). While not quite as obvious, there is good evidence 
that the watershed also burned over at least five times in the 18th century 
(1715, 1748, 1763, 1773, and 1789). Data for this period are not as com- 
plete as for the 19th century, but the trend toward the same frequency of 
five fires per century is there. The resulting mean fire interval for these ma- 
jor, or area-wide fires, is 22 years. 
Inspection of the MFC confirms the fact that smaller fires were occurring 
on the area at irregular intervals; their occurrence and location show little 
apparent relationship to the less frequent.but more widespread fires that cov- 
ered the entire watershed. For example, there were only five fire scars re- 
corded on the area during the 26-year period 1847--1873 and about the 
same number during the 20-year period 1873--1893. 
Further interpretation of the Master Fire Chronology concerning inciden- 
ce of fires not associated with major fire years indicates the following: fires 
that are reflected on any of the specimens as having occurred the year previ- 
ous to a major fire year are plausible. Any fires identified as having occurred 
during the 1st or 2nd year following a major fire year are considerably less 
likely to have occurred because of lack of available fuel. 
Group analysis 
A small group of fire-scarred trees (Fig. 1, Nos. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29) were 
selected from an area of about 5 acres (2 ha) in the southeast corner of the 
watershed to determine if this concentration of specimens might yield fire 
frequency information of interest. Six specimens were chosen, one of which 
turned out to be undatable. One specimen was a well-preserved downed snag; 
the remainder were living trees. 

21 
Nine fires were recorded on this small area between 1806 and 1893. The 
major fires of 1819, 1847, 1873, and 1893 were all well represented. The 
snag contained five scars, the outermost ring of which was dated as 1893, in- 
dicating that the tree was probably killed by this 1893 fire. The mean fire in- 
terval for the small group was 11 years, confirming the fact that fire had 
burned somewhere on this 2 ha area at about twice the frequency of the ma- 
jor fires. 
Species sensitivity 
Fire scars were evident on all species. Advanced stages of decay were 
present in many old-growth Engelman spruce, white fir, blue spruce, cork- 
bark fir, and Douglas-fir -- a condition that is common in overmature mixed 
conifer stands. Fire was apparently responsible for decay entering many of 
these fire-sensitive species, but extensive damage was also evident in the 
stumps of many overmature trees that showed no evidence of fire scars. 
Southwestern white pine is considered a fire-sensitive tree in the younger 
age classes, but as it matures it becomes more fire resistant as the bark 
thickens. Douglas-fir is also fire sensitive as a young tree but develops a firm 
resistance to damage as a mature tree.

fire scars were common throughout the area. It appeared from the initial 
survey that white pine might be more fire susceptible and, therefore, might 
provide a more complete record of fire incidence than ponderosa pine. To 
test this theory, six "pairs" of white pine-ponderosa pine were selected -- 
most of which were located from just a few feet to nearly 130 feet (40 m) 
apart, to determine if one or the other yielded a consistently higher record 
of fire scars (Fig. 3 ). 
There were no obvious differences as 40 scars were recorded on the pon- 
derosa pine and 38 on the white pine. On some pairs the ponderosa pine 
recorded the most scars, on others the white pine had more scars. For one 
pair (Nos. 13 and 14), located about 40 m apart, ten fires were recorded on 
the white pine and only six on the ponderosa; and two scars were common 
to both trees. The most interesting pair was separated by only about 3 m 
(Fig. 4). The white pine in the foreground (No. 19) recorded 13 scars, the 
ponderosa pine (No. 20) 15 scars, and there were seven scars that were com- 
mon to both trees. However, 13 scars were not common to either, and it is 
interesting to note that even though the two trees were located nearly in 
the center of the watershed, neither tree reflected the date of the last major 
fire that burned over the area in 1893. 
Fig. 4. Paired trees No. 9 (white pine), and No. 20 (ponderosa pine), located 15 feet 
(4.6 m) apart, had 15 and 13 fire scars, respectively, with only seven fires that were com- 
mon to both specimens. 

23 
Individual specimen analysis 
Two of the specimens warrant special attention. Number 19 (foreground, 
Fig. 4) was a mature white pine, 70 cm dbh, with a pith date of 1618. It 
contains an unusual pattern of scarring. The first fire scar appeared in 1627 
(the oldest fire scar identified on the site), followed by a long period (73 
years) before the next fire scar in 1700. From 1700 to 1800 this tree was 
scarred at an average interval of about 11 years. Between 1800 and 1900 
four scars were evident. Three were identified as certain fire scars; one was 
considered questionable. The questionable scar occurred in 1873 (a major 
fire year) so the assumption was made that it also was a legitimate fire scar. 
As mentioned above, the last major fire in 1893 was not recorded on this 
specimen. 
Specimen 24 (Fig. 5) is an unusual-shaped cross section taken from the 
stump of a mature ponderosa pine cut during the logging operation. This tree 
was located on gently sloping terrain in the south-central portion of the 
watershed. Center date was approximately 1656 and the first recognizable 
scar occurred 69 years later {1725). This tree had a total of 18 scars, re- 
Fig. 5. Tree 24 was selected following the logging operation to achieve better area cover- 
age of the watershed. Eighteen fires were recorded, eight of which correspond to major 
Rre years between 1747 and 1893. This was the only specimen that recorded fires on two 
successive years (1788 and 1789). 

24 
flected all eight of the major fires on the area between 1747 and 1893, 
showed seven fires that scarred the tree on years other than the major fire 
years, and was the only tree that had positive identification of fires occurring 
on successive years (1788 and 1789}. The fire interval for this particular 
tree (10 years) corresponds closely to individual tree average fire intervals 
for fire history specimens taken from two ponderosa pine stands growing 
at lower elevations (Dieterich, 1980a, b). 
DISCUSSION 
Jones (1974), without knowing what the historical fire frequency had 
been in the southwestern mixed conifer type, recognized that fires had 
probably been an important factor in shaping stand composition and struc- 
ture. Moir and Ludwig (1979) recognized quaking aspen as the major seral 
species following fire, but they noted that many other conifers of the late 
seral or climax vegetation also become quickly established after fire. 
Fire history records for South Thomas Creek indicate that the most re- 
cent recorded fire to burn over the watershed occurred in 1893 and natural 
fuels have been accumulating on the area since that time; that is, 81 years 
have elapsed from the last fire to the date of the fuel inventory. The Thomas 
Creek fire history provides an important source of ecological data to use 
for interpreting stand conditions as they exist today, and for speculating on 
condition of the ecosystem as it may have existed prior to the turn of the 
century. 
Climate 
It is a weU-established fact that both temperature and moisture influence 
tree growth (Fritts, 1974). Moisture, in particular, is the one factor that con- 
trols the growth of the tree, producing narrow rings during a year (or years) of 
moisture deficiency and wider rings when rainfall is at or above normal. 
Using established techniques of dendroclimatology, Fritts (1965)developed 
a series of maps of western states showing periods of moisture deficiency, 
and moisture excesses, shown by decades beginning in 1501. 
Table I shows the relationship between the major fire years on South 
Thomas Creek (as shown by the Master Fire Chronology) and periods of 
moisture deficiency as reflected in the regional climatic maps prepared by 
Fritts {1965). Six of the fires burning over South Thomas Creek occurred 
during periods of moisture deficiency ranging from slightly below normal 
to well below normal. One fire occurred during a period of normal moisture, 
and three fires occurred when the moisture-deficiency index was slightly 
above normal. 
Fire risk 
The Mogollon Rim and the White Mountains of Arizona are exposed to a 
higher incidence of potential fire-starting thunderstorms than any region of

the western United States (Schroeder et al., 1964; Barrows, 1978). The po n- 
derosa pine forests along the Mogollon Rim grow at elevations where annual 
rainfall is lower than expected in the higher elevation mixed conifer forests. 
Differences between the Mogollon Rim and the White Mountains in the in- 
cidence of lightning strikes reaching the ground (lightning fire risk) are prob- 
ably small, and the resulting fires are influenced as much by differences in 
fuel moisture, relative humidity, and air temperature as by elevation. Any- 
one working in the White Mountains in the summer will be impressed with 
the number of days on which thunderstorms develop and lightning occurs. 
Compared to the lower elevation ponderosa pine forests, thunderstorm ac- 
tivity in the White Mountains is generally accompanied by more rainfall per 
storm, higher humidities, slow fuel moisture recovery rates, and lower 
temperatures. Late afternoon showers have the effect of extending the pe- 
riods of higher fuel moisture through the night and into the early morning 
hours, thereby reducing the chances for a lightning-caused ignition to de- 
velop into a fire of significant proportions. In this situation small fires are 
common, but large fires would be expected only after extended periods of 
weather free from thunderstorm activity. 
There are two seasonal situations that contribute to the incidence of large 
fires in the mixed conifer. The first is a springtime condition associated with 
extended periods of warm temperature, low humidities, persistent and gusty 
winds, and absence of nighttime deposits of moisture from dew. These con- 
ditions generally precede the onset of the summer thunderstorm season. 
During historical times only two ignition sources would have been present: 
Indians or trappers in the area; or the occasional dry, isolated thunderstorm 
that ignited fires but failed to produce significant amounts of rainfall. During 
these times even a scattered incidence of lightning imposed on dry, fire-re- 
ceptive fuels could have resulted in fires that spread freely over large areas. 
With the onset of the "monsoon" thunderstorm season, large fires would 
have been less likely. 

26 
The second condition that can result in large fires occurs in the late summer 
or early fall following the cessation of the heavy thunderstorm season, after 
fuels have dried from higher daytime temperatures and lower relative humid- 
ities, and while the daylight hours are still relatively long. Thunderstorms 
are still present and can ignite fuels that are low in moisture content, re- 
sulting in fires that will spread in the dry litter and curing herbaceous vege- 
tation. 
These are the conditions under which fires might have occurred during 
centuries past. Little is known about the influence that Indians may have 
had on fire occurrence in this area, but it is reasonable to assume that they 
used fire for hunting and clearing. In any case, the constant recurrence of 
weather patterns that contribute to fire incidence in forested areas today 
is probably little changed from what it was in centuries past except that 
human-caused fires are superimposed on the total. One difference is that 
during the past 70--80 years fires have been suppressed and fuels have con- 
tinued to accumulate in the absence of large-scale effort to dispose of this 
material. In addition, fuels have been added through activities of man, com- 
pounding the problem of maintaining fuel loadings at a manageable level. 
Fire occurrence pattern 
The remarkably regular pattern of historical fire occurrence reflected by 
the Master Fire Chronology may be typical for other southwestern mixed 
conifer stands. It may also be typical, with some variations, for other forest 
types where conditions of fuel accumulation, fire weather, and fire risk com- 
bine to produce fires that burn for extended periods and cover large areas. 
The fires that have burned on South Thomas were not stand-replacing fires 
such as are experienced in spruce-fir or lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) 
stands. They probably killed some trees in nearly all size classes, but the 
multi-age characteristic of existing stands is testimony to the fact that trees 
in many age groups survived. 
Because of the size of the area involved, the mean fire interval (3 years) 
for all recorded fires occurring on the South Thomas drainage has little sig- 
nificance except to verify continuing fire risk. Mean fire interval for a smaller 
area, and for a different vegetative type (e.g., ponderosa pine), would be in- 
terpreted differently because the assumption is made that each fire probably 
burned over the entire area but scarred only a limited number of the fire 
scar-susceptible trees (Dieterich, 1980a, b). 
ECOSYSTEM RESPONSE 
There is no way of determining exactly what the mixed conifer ecosystem 
on South Thomas Creek was like when the last area-wide fire occurred in 
1893. Parsons and DeBenedetti (1979) identified 
changes in successional 
patterns resulting from years of fire suppression in a mixed conifer stand in 

27 
California's Sierra Nevada. Effectively excluding fire from this stand resulted 
in an increase in fuel loading, an increase in stand density (young trees), and 
a change in species composition that favored the more shade-tolerant tree 
species. Some species were favored by the change (white fir), while others 
(giant sequoia, Sequoiadendron giganteum) showed an unfavorable response 
in terms of natural regeneration. Agee {1978) states that the energy dynam- 
ics in a Sierra Nevada mixed conifer ecosystem appear to be more stable 
under a periodic fire regime. 
Knowing the fire history and climatic conditions for South Thomas Creek, 
the author has attempted to reconstruct various aspects of the ecosystem as 
it might have existed more than a century ago. Considered in this subjective 
evaluation are: existing vegetation; types of fires; rates of fuel accumulation; 
effects of fires on vegetation; wildlife habitat requirements; and water yield 
characteristics. 
Fuels 
Periodic fires would have reduced the fuel loading to levels considerably 
below where they are today. Greatest reductions would have been in the 
large material and in the material that makes up the upper portion of the 
forest floor. Fires would have caused mortality of trees in nearly all age 
classes, and a portion of this dead material would have been available to 
burn in subsequent fires. Periodic fires would have raised the general canopy 
level throughout the area, reducing the potential for crown fires but also 
contributing somewhat to the accumulation of fine fuels on the forest floor, 
which then would have been available to burn with subsequent fires. Natural 
fuel accumulation rates are unknown, but it is assumed that such rates under 
a regime of periodic fires would not be appreciably different from current 
rates of fuel accumulation. Fuel loadings would have been at their lowest 
level immediately following the occasional fires that burned over the water- 
shed. Loadings during historical times were probably no more than one- 
fourth to one-third of present<lay loadings, or 30--45 t/ha. Rates of fuel ac- 
cumulation would have accelerated for 3--5 years following these area-wide 
fires until the material that was killed by the fire was deposited on the 
ground. Since sufficient fuel was accumulated to support another fire within 
a relatively short period, and since lightning risk was probably fairly consis- 
tent from year to year, climatic conditions must have been the primary fac- 
tor responsible for determining the frequency of fires that burned over the 
area. 
Species composition-stand structure 
An obvious difference would have been in the larger component of aspen 
on all parts of the watershed than exist today. Regeneration of all species 
would have been periodically abundant, fluctuating with the occurrence 
of both small and large fires. Openings caused by fire-induced or natural 

28 
mortality of large trees or clumps of trees would have been quickly occupied 
by regeneration as seedbeds were made more favorable as a result of litter re- 
moval. Ponderosa pine would have been favored due to its fire resistance and 
ability to regenerate in openings. This species would have existed as nearly 
pure stands on south-facing slopes. Many age classes would have been re- 
presented because regeneration would have been nearly continuous, and 
only a portion of the regenerated trees would have been destroyed by perio- 
dic fires. Basal area would have been somewhat less than under today's con- 
ditions, and a larger percentage of trees would have been in younger age 
classes. Scattered old-growth trees of nearly all species would have been 
present, many of which contained fire scars from the periodic fires. Recent 
stand inventories indicate that the spruce-fir component of the stand is in- 
creasing (G.J. Gottfried, personal communication, 1981}. This change is 
probably related to the fact that fire has been absent from the stand for the 
past 90 years. 
Fire behavior 
An observer of fire behavior on these historical fires would have noted 
that, even on fires that covered the entire watershed, intensities probably 
did not exceed a low-moderate level. Some crowning in the developing 
stands of regeneration would have occurred, and short upslope runs by 
head fires would have caused mortality in some of the larger conifers. The 
sizable aspen component in the stand would have had a dampening effect 
on the tendency for severe or extreme fire behavior, and these patches of 
aspen may have been responsible for excluding some area from burning with- 
in the much larger burned area. The character of the stand today and the 
fire history of the area provides no evidence of a stand-replacing fire having 
occurred on the watershed in the past 300 years. 
Wildlife habitat 
The occasional small fires and the less frequent area-wide fires would have 
created conditions favorable to many species of wildlife. Elk (Cervus canaden- 
sis) and deer (Odocoileus hemionus) would have benefited from the aspen 
sprouting and the increase in native grasses, and recycling of nutrients would 
have made the forage more abundant and nutritious. Turkeys (Meleagris 
gallopavo), if present, would have been favored by openings, roost trees, 
and available food. The red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), which are 
so common today, might have had their cone caches destroyed by fire, but 
with a 20-year interval between area-wide fires, this may not have had an ad- 
verse impact on their population. Cone crops should have remained normal 
throughout the period. Food and cover for the black bear (Ursus americanus), 
commonly found on the area today, would probably have been adversely 
affected by the periodic fires due to the more open character of the stand 
and destruction of large, rotten logs harboring insects and grubs. 

29 
Hydrology 
Comparing current hydrological properties of the watershed with con- 
ditions estimated to have been present during historical times, several vari- 
ables must be considered. Stand densities today are at a level where nearly 
all available moisture is used for transpiration during the growing season. 
During historical times stand densities were probably somewhat lower, but 
probably not low enough to cause large differences in transpiration losses. 
Spring runoff would probably have exceeded what is occurring today. An in- 
crease in snowpack would have resulted from snow being trapped in fire- 
created openings, and in patches of aspen coming in following periodic 
fires. Although summer flow in small streams such as Thomas Creek has 
probably never been continuous, the runoff from summer storms may have 
been slightly higher during historical times because of the reduced amount 
of forest floor material available to absorb rainfall. 
Site productivity 
It is doubtful that these historical fires would have caused any significant 
impairment of site quality. In fact, burning of ground fuels and surface litter 
would have encouraged recycling of nutrients through the system by re- 
leasing minerals to the soil that are bound up in the accumulation of organic 
material. Nutrients made available in this manner would have been utilized 
by all types of plants including grasses and shrubs and trees of various age 
classes in the residual stand. High-intensity fire can produce significant losses 
of nitrogen and other minerals, but the type of fires that appear to have 
burned over the area at an interval of roughly five per century apparently did 
not result in any long-term damage to the ecosystem. The intermittent fires 
occurring on the watershed would have produced a predominantly favorable 
response in terms of fuel reduction, seedbed preparation, and forage produc- 
tion for wildlife. 
SUMMARY 
The South Thomas Creek fire history study provides a basis for under- 
standing some of the ecological conditions existing on the area during cen- 
turies past. Knowing the pattern of historical fire occurrence, and recon- 
structing probable fire behavior that accompanied these fires, makes it pos- 
sible better to predict resource response to fire in this particular ecosystem. 
If we can extend this knowledge from South Thomas Creek to other south- 
western mixed conifer stands, we can perhaps use the following information 
to help manage the ecosystem more effectively: 
Southwestern mixed conifer has existed for centuries in a fire environ- 
ment that consisted of frequent, small, low-intensity fires, and fires that 
burned over larger areas at a mean fire interval of roughly 22 years. High-in- 
tensity, standreplacing wildfires were apparently not common. 

30 
An effective fire suppression organization has interrupted the 22-year 
natural fire cycle that was present on the South Thomas Creek drainage 
during the 200 years prior to 1900. The long-term effects of the 90-year fire- 
free period are clearly evident in terms of present species composition, age- 
class distribution, fuel loading, and large fire potential. Less obvious but 
probably equally important are changes that have occurred in understory 
vegetation, wildlife habitat, water yield, and cycling of nutrients. 
Lightning fire risk has probably not changed much from historical times, 
but the threat of large fires has increased because of increased fuel loading, 
changes in stand structure, and the ever-present human risk during periods 
of critical fire weather. 
Both ponderosa pine and southwestern white pine provide satisfactory 
material for conducting fire history studies. No apparent differences were 
detected in species sensitivity or tendency for scarring from fire. 
A group analysis in which five fire-scarred specimens from a 2-ha area 
were used to construct a Master Fire Chronology for the site, yielded a 
mean fire interval of 11 years -- about half the fire frequency of the major 
fires occurring on the area. The mean fire interval for the entire drainage was 
about 3 years -- a value that should be interpreted differently than the cor- 
responding value for a ponderosa pine site at lower elevations. 
Periodic fires would have created favorable conditions for regeneration of 
grasses, shrubs, and trees growing on the area. Fires would have effectively 
thinned the young stands as they were developing, and raised the crown level 
on the overstory. Openings in the canopy would have been common, and a 
more pronounced conifer-aspen mosaic would have been evident.
