The frequency of large wildfires has increased in 
recent decades in some dry coniferous forest types of North 
America. Increases in the number and size of stand-replac-
ing fires is often attributed to fuel buildups and dense stand 
conditions resulting from past management practices and 
fire exclusion, in combination with drought and warm 
temperatures (Covington & Moore, 1994; Swetnam, Allen 
& Betancourt, 1999; Korb & Springer, 2003; Schoennagel 
et al., 2005; Westerling et al., 2006). Large stand-replac-
ing wildfires can leave behind areas of exposed mineral 
soil that are quickly colonized by opportunistic species, 
either native or exotic (Crawford et al., 2001; Griffis et al., 
2001; Sieg, Phillips & Moser, 2003; Wolfson et al., 2005). 
Many colonizing exotic species are ephemeral or apparently 
benign, but a subset are invasive and spread over a consid-
erable area, and some are considered “transformer species” 
(Wells et al., 1986), which persist over large areas and can 
greatly alter ecosystem structure or function (Richardson 
et al., 2000). Ecosystem alterations may include replacing 
native vegetation, displacing wildlife, out-crossing with 
native flora, and altering nutrient-cycles, hydrology, and 
disturbance regimes (Vitousek et al., 1997; Walker & Smith,

Abstract: Severe wildfires often facilitate the spread of exotic invasive species, such as Dalmatian toadflax (Linaria  
dalmatica). We hypothesized that toadflax growth and reproduction would increase with increasing burn severity in a ponderosa 
pine (Pinus ponderosa)-dominated forest. We measured toadflax density, cover, flowering stalks, and native species 
richness and cover on 327 plots for 3 y after a 2001 wildfire. Toadflax stem density, cover, and flowering stalks increased 
in 2003, then decreased in 2004 in all burn severity classes, but remained higher than initial 2002 values. Toadflax spread to 
previously uncolonized areas, though stem density decreased in unburned plots. Transition matrices showed that more plots 
on moderately (73%) and severely (74%) burned areas classified as high toadflax density in 2002 remained high density in 
2004. Deterministic matrix modeling using 2002 to 2004 transition probabilities projected that the percentage of high-density 
plots would stabilize on moderately and severely burned sites at 41 and 61%, respectively. In contrast, 20-y rates of change 
(Ȝ) for unburned and low-severity burn sites were < 1.0, and stabilizing at 2% for unburned plots and 19% for low-severity 
burn plots. Post-wildfire conditions in high-severity burned areas favour increased density, cover, reproduction, and spread of 
Dalmatian toadflax, while native species richness was reduced, suggesting that the invasive species would persist, at least in 
the short term, at the expense of natives.

Résumé : Les feux de forêt sévères facilitent souvent la propagation d’espèces envahissantes exotiques, telle que la linaire 
à feuilles larges (Linaria dalmatica). Nous avons formulé l’hypothèse que la croissance et la reproduction de la linaire 
augmenteraient avec un accroissement de la sévérité du feu dans une forêt dominée par le pin ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa). 
Après un feu en 2001, nous avons mesuré la densité des linaires, leur couverture, le nombre de tiges en fleurs, ainsi que 
la richesse et la couverture en espèces indigènes dans 327 parcelles durant 3 ans. La densité des tiges de linaires, leur 
couverture et le nombre de tiges en fleurs ont augmenté en 2003 et ensuite diminué en 2004 dans toutes les classes de 
sévérité de feu, mais les valeurs sont demeurées plus élevées qu’initialement en 2002. Les linaires se sont propagées dans 
des secteurs auparavant non colonisés, quoique dans les sites non brûlés la densité de tiges était plus faible. Des matrices de 
transition ont démontré que plus de parcelles des secteurs modérément (73 %) et sévèrement (74 %) brûlés s’étant classées 
dans la catégorie de densité élevée de linaires en 2002 le sont demeurées en 2004. Un modèle matriciel déterministe utilisant 
les probabilités de transition de 2002 à 2004 prévoyait que le pourcentage de parcelles possédant une haute densité de linaires 
se stabiliserait à 41% dans les sites modérément brûlés et à 61 % dans ceux brûlés sévèrement. À l’opposé, les taux de 
changement sur 20 ans (Ȝ) pour les sites non brûlés et ceux brûlés légèrement étaient < 1,0 et les pourcentages se sont stabilisés 
à 2 % pour les parcelles non brûlées et à 19 % pour celles brûlées légèrement. Les conditions après feu dans les secteurs brûlés 
sévèrement ont favorisé une augmentation de la densité, couverture, reproduction et propagation des linaires à feuilles larges 
alors que la richesse en espèces indigènes a été réduite, suggérant que l'espèce envahissante persistera, du moins à court 
terme, aux dépens des espèces indigènes.

1997; D’Antonio & Meyerson, 2002). Such alterations can 
profoundly impact biodiversity (Richardson et al., 2000).
A number of previous studies have reported an increase 
in exotic species invasion following fire (D’Antonio, 2000). 
The degree to which exotic species dominate post-fire com-
munities as well as what species appear following wildfires 
depends on a number of factors. Individual abilities of 
species to tolerate fire or colonize burned areas, pre-fire 
population levels, and degree of competitiveness are impor-
tant attributes affecting invasive species response to fire in 
grasslands (Grace et al., 2001). In coniferous forests, severi-
ty of the fire, which influences availability of resources such 
as light and nutrients, propagule pressure, time since fire, 
and past management history can also influence post-fire 
community composition. Increased populations or richness 
of exotic species are associated with high-severity burns in 
some studies (Keeley, Lubin & Fotheringham, 2003; Hunter 
et al., 2006; Kerns, Thies & Niwa, 2006), but others report 
relatively low levels of exotic species cover on severely 
burned areas (Huisinga et al., 2005; Kuenzi, Fulé & Sieg, 
2008). Propagule pressure of individual species as well as 
time since the burn can affect post-fire plant community 
composition (Floyd et al., 2006). Past management history, 
including seeding practices and livestock grazing, may 
influence post-fire plant communities and the contribution 
of exotic species (Keeley, Lubin & Fotheringham, 2003; 
Hunter et al., 2006). For many exotic species, we have a 
poor understanding of the mechanisms involved in their 
establishment and spread following disturbances (Stohlgren 
et al., 1999; Grace et al., 2001).
Dalmatian toadflax (Linaria dalmatica) (hereafter 
“toadflax”) was introduced to North America in 1894 as an 
ornamental plant from the Mediterranean region, where it is 
native from Croatia to Iran (Alex, 1962). It has since become 
widespread in the western United States and Canada, where 
it is considered highly invasive, replacing native forage spe-
cies for domestic and wild animals (Vujnovic & Wein, 1996; 
Lajeunesse, 1999). Toadflax is legally designated as a “nox-
ious weed” or “regulated non-native plant” in 12 western 
US states (USDA NRCS, 2007) and 3 Canadian provinces 
(Rice, 2007). Toadflax is a polycarpic, short-lived peren-
nial member of the Scrophulariaceae family. Plants produce 
large numbers of seeds that likely disperse only a short dis-
tance from the parent plant (Lajeunesse, 1999). Germination 
occurs mostly in the spring, but seeds can remain dormant 
for 10 y or more (Robocker, 1970). Thus, while individual 
plants may survive 3 to 5 y, patches of toadflax may per-
sist 13 y or longer due to germination of seeds from the 
seedbank. High seed production, vegetative reproduction, 
an extensive root system and carbohydrate reserves, plus a 
long active growing period allow toadflax to compete with 
native species and flourish in disturbed areas (Robocker, 
1970; Lajeunesse, 1999). Toadflax might be considered a 
transformer species, as it has been credited with disrupting 
ecosystem composition and structure by replacing native 
plant species in some settings (Robocker, 1974; Lajeunesse, 
1999) and even out-competing other non-natives (Lange, 
1958). Toadflax is not considered allelopathic, but alkaloids 
found in the leaves and stems make it unpalatable to most 
animals (Vujnovic & Wein, 1996; Lajeunesse, 1999).
Few quantitative studies have explored toadflax 
response to fire. In a Montana study, biomass and seed pro-
duction of toadflax increased dramatically after a prescribed 
burn, compared to an unburned area (Jacobs & Sheley, 
2003). Toadflax cover also increased in burned plots but 
was not significantly different from unburned plots (Jacobs 
& Sheley, 2003). In a northern Arizona study, toadflax den-
sity increased after a low-severity prescribed burn, threaten-
ing a rare species (Phillips & Crisp, 2001). It is a common 
exotic species in seedbanks in this area (Korb et al., 2005) 
and is a successful colonizer of severely burned areas where 
slash piles were burned (Korb, Johnson & Covington, 
2004). Hunter et al. (2006) reported spread of a related spe-
cies, Linaria vulgaris, at 2 severe wildfire sites in Colorado.
We took advantage of a wildfire in which detailed fire 
severity measurements had been completed (Cocke, Fulé 
& Crouse, 2005a) to address the response of toadflax and 
interaction with the native plant community. We measured 
the response of toadflax for 3 y post-fire at 4 burn severity 
levels and 4 toadflax density levels, asking the following 
questions: 1) How do toadflax density, cover, and reproduc-
tion vary with burn severity? We hypothesized that toadflax 
would respond favourably under increasing burn severity. 
2) Is the response of toadflax dependent on its density? We 
hypothesized that toadflax would increase the most in areas 
with higher initial toadflax density. 3) How do cover and 
density of toadflax relate to changes in native species rich-
ness? We hypothesized that native species richness would 
increase over time since fire but that areas with high toad-
flax cover and density would be associated with decreased 
native richness.
Methods
STUDY AREA
This study was conducted in areas burned in the Leroux 
wildfire on the San Francisco Peaks, Kachina Wilderness 
Area, of the Coconino National Forest, approximately 
10 km north of Flagstaff, Arizona (Figure 1). In June 2001, 
the human-ignited wildfire burned 486 ha on the south-fac-
ing slope of Agassiz Peak, between 2490 and 3145 m in 
elevation. The Leroux fire burned a ponderosa-pine–domi-
nant forest in a mosaic pattern, leaving a patchwork of burn 
severity ranging from unburned to high-severity crown 
fire (Cocke, Fulé & Crouse, 2005a). Typical understory is 
dominated by the perennial native grasses Festuca arizo-
nica, Muhlenbergia montana, Poa fendleriana, and Elymus 
elymoides, numerous annual and perennial forbs, and some 
exotic species (Korb & Springer, 2003; Fisher & Fulé, 
2004). The Kachina Wilderness has experienced extended 
fire exclusion, which contributed to the development of 
dense forests (Cocke, Fulé & Crouse, 2005b). The area 
was heavily utilized historically for logging and livestock 
grazing and is currently used for a variety of recreation 
activities. These activities introduced exotic species, includ-
ing toadflax, to the wilderness area prior to the Leroux fire 
(L. Moser, US Forest Service, pers. comm., 2002; Fisher & 
Fulé, 2004).
Soil parent materials are andesite and basalt, and com-
mon soils are Inceptisols, Mollisols, and Alfisols (USDA 

ÉCOSCIENCE, VOL. 15 (2), 2008

Forest Service, 1995). Precipitation patterns are bimodal, 
characterized by periodic snow and rainfall in winter, fol-
lowed by a pronounced drought in May and June, with 
monsoon rains occurring in July and August (Sheppard et 
al., 2002). Average annual precipitation is 53.9 cm in the 
Flagstaff area, and the monthly mean temperature ranges 
from –0.8 to 16.2 °C (54-y average) (Western Regional 
Climate Center, 2004). Annual precipitation from 2001 to 
2004 was usually less than the long-term average: 44.7 cm 
(2001), 32.8 cm (2002), 45.2 cm (2003), and 59.9 cm (2004).
FIELD METHODS
We established 327 permanent research plots distrib-
uted within and adjacent to area burned in the Leroux 
fire. Plots were plant-centred, i.e., each plot was centred 
around 1 or more plants (Travis & Sutter, 1986), cho-
sen based on burn severity and toadflax stem density in 
16 burn severity × plant density categories: 4 burn sever-
ity categories and 4 toadflax stem density categories. As 
is the case in most wildfire studies, pre-existing fuel and 
topographic characteristics may have influenced fire sever-
ity and Dalmatian toadflax response. However, we tried 
to control variability by limiting sampling to the lower 
elevations (pine forest) on relatively consistent slopes and 
aspects and interspersing plots representing all the sampling 
categories. Burn severity was determined using a landscape 
burn severity map with 4 severity levels based on differ-
enced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) analysis (unburned, 
dNBR ≤ 50; low, 51–240; moderate, 241–570; high, ≥ 571) 
(Cocke, Fulé & Crouse, 2005a). Severity assessment was 
confirmed by field plots according to NPS-USGS Burn 
Severity Mapping Project guidelines (NPS-USGS, 2002; 
Cocke, Fulé & Crouse, 2005a). Field measurements used the 
Composite Burn Index, in which qualitative severity levels 
are assigned to vegetation, woody debris, and soil variables 
(NPS-USGS, 2002). When landscape- and plot-level burn 
severities differed, the plot-level burn severity was used for 
plot classification in order to more accurately describe the 
growing conditions affecting understory species. Density 
categories were based on the number of toadflax stems 
(ramets) within the plot frame: (1) none, (2) low: 1–10, 
(3) medium: 11–29, and (4) high: ≥ 30 stems. These catego-
ries represented approximately equal divisions of Dalmatian 
toadflax density observed at the onset of sampling.
We selected 19 to 28 plots per category, except in the 
unburned severity class, where only 11-17 plots were estab-
lished per toadflax density class because fewer toadflax 
plants were present in unburned areas. Plots with no toad-
flax plants were selected by walking in a random direction 
from toadflax plots until an area of similar environmental 
attributes (aspect, overstory cover, elevation, understory 
community type, burn severity) was identified where toad-
flax was absent but was still within the defined study area. 
This method ensured that the control plots were located in 
areas with habitats similar to those of non-control plots. A 
10-m toadflax-free buffer was required for the establish-

ment of control plots (“no-toadflax” category). All plots 
were measured in summer months of 2002, 2003, and 2004 
after onset of the rainy season in mid-July, when growth of 
many native species begins.
Plots were 1 m2 (2 × 0.5 m) and permanently marked 
with 2 iron stakes at diagonal corners. To minimize visual 
impact in the Wilderness Area, stakes were placed flush 
with the forest floor and nearby reference trees were tagged 
near the base facing the tagged corner stakes; tags were 
painted brown to conceal them. We recorded distance and 
direction from the reference tree to the tagged corner stakes 
and noted UTM coordinates, slope, azimuth, aspect, and 
elevation of each plot.
Each plant rooted in a plot was identified to species 
or genus where species was undetermined, and classified 
as native or exotic to Arizona (Kearney & Peebles, 1960). 
For toadflax, we counted the number of stems and flower-
ing stalks, and estimated percent foliar cover. Counting the 
actual number of flowers per plant was not feasible given 
the resources available for the study, so we counted flow-
ering stalks, defined as a primary, secondary, or tertiary 
branching stalk with multiple flowers. The primary stalk 
is the one rooted in the ground, from which secondary and 
then tertiary stalks branch off. We counted the number of 
plants for other exotic plant species.
DATA ANALYSIS
Plots were classified by plot-level burn severity and 
toadflax density class for statistical analysis. The statistical 
package SPSS version 12.0 was used for all analysis (SPSS, 
2003). Assumptions of normality and equal variances 
were tested using Shapiro–Wilk’s and Levene’s tests, with 
Į = 0.05, for toadflax stem density, cover, flower stalks, 
and native species richness. Data met parametric assump-
tions, except for a departure from normality for 3 variables: 
stems, flower stalks, and native richness (Shapiro–Wilk 
P < 0.002). Normal probability plots indicated that depar-
tures were minor, and we concluded that robust parametric 
methods were the best way to test for burn effects, density 
effects, time, and burn by density interaction, so we accept-
ed the non-normal data (Steel & Torrie, 1980). Statistically 
significant differences in toadflax stem density, cover, flow-
er stalks, and native species richness were assessed using 
the repeated-measures general linear model, with year as 
the time variable and burn severity and density as between-
subject factors.
A significant interaction between year × burn 
severity × density was followed by a univariate ANOVA 
of the change between years (2002–2003 and 2003–2004), 
with a Bonferroni correction of Į/2. Tukey’s HSD post hoc 
test was used to compare individual means following a 
significant ANOVA. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was 
calculated to examine the relationship of native species rich-
ness between years, native species richness, and toadflax 
density and cover, and native species cover and toadflax 
density and cover. We calculated the percentage of control 
plots without toadflax whose buffer zone became infested 
with toadflax.
We used matrix modeling (Lefkovitch, 1965; Burgman, 
Ferson & Akcakaya, 1993) to explore how the proportion of 
plots classified as high density varied through time among 
fire severity classes. Stage-based models are commonly 
used to assess population rates of change (Ȝ) for plant spe-
cies with discrete life-history stages. Such models have 
been used to model population growth rates of invasive 
species under varying stages of invasion (Parker, 2000) or 
in response to control efforts (Drayton & Primack, 1999). 
Matrix models can also be used to compare transition rates 
among plant community types (Scanlan & Archer, 1991; 
Hibbard et al., 2003). We developed transition matrices 
for each fire severity class to track annual changes in the 
proportion of plots classified in a given density class (none, 
low, moderate, or high) between 2002, 2003, and 2004. We 
then used a Visual Basic for Applications macro in Excel 
(Sieg, King & Van Dyke, 2003) to calculate the rate of 
change (Ȝ) of the proportion of plots initially classified as 
high density in 2002 that remained classified as high density 
in 2004, by fire severity class. We used the number of plots 
in each density class in a given fire severity class as initial 
values for the models and ran the deterministic models for 
20 y or until Ȝ converged (Burgman, Ferson & Akcakaya, 
1993). We then compared relative differences in projected 
Ȝ’s, as this often provides insights into underlying causes 
for changes in Ȝ (Beissinger & Westphal, 1998).
Results
TOADFLAX RESPONSE
Toadflax stem density, percent cover, and flowering 
stalks in burned plots increased in 2003, then decreased 
slightly in 2004 in most density classes, but remained great-
er in 2004 compared to 2002. Averaged across all density 
classes, total toadflax stem density increased by 38–221% 
from 2002 to 2003 and decreased by 13–22% from 2003 
to 2004 (Figure 2a). Toadflax cover increased by 65–109% 
from 2002 to 2003 and decreased by 2–45% from 2003 to 
2004 (Figure 2b). Similarly, flower stalk density increased 
by 16–147% from 2002 to 2003 and decreased by 11–46% 
from 2003 to 2004 (Figure 2c). In contrast, in the unburned 
plots toadflax stem density decreased consistently each year 
(P = 0.04), percent cover increased insignificantly each 
year, and flower stalk density remained similar.
There were significant time × burn severity × density 
interactions for toadflax stem density, % cover, and flow-
er stalks (P < 0.001). The change in stems from 2002 to 
2003 differed significantly among burn severity classes 
(P < 0.001) but not among density classes (P = 0.2), while 
change in stems from 2003 to 2004 differed by density 
class (P < 0.001; Figure 3a) but not burn severity (P = 0.8; 
Figure 2a). The increase in toadflax stem density between 
2002 and 2003 was greater on high burn severity plots than 
all other burn severity classes (Tukey’s HSD, Figure 2a).
From 2003 to 2004, the change in stem density also 
differed significantly among density classes (Tukey’s 
HSD, High = Medium > Low; Figure 3a). The change 
between 2002 and 2003 for toadflax cover and flower-
ing stalks showed a significant burn severity, density, and 
interaction effect (P < 0.001) with a separation between 
the high burn severity and other severity classes, as well 
as a separation between the no-toadflax class and other 
density classes (Tukey’s HSD). These same variables 

ÉCOSCIENCE, VOL. 15 (2), 2008
217
between 2003 and 2004 differed only among toadflax den-
sity classes (P < 0.001). The decrease in cover from 2003 
to 2004 was significantly less for the low density class 
(Tukey’s HSD), and similar between the moderate and 
high density classes. The change in flowering stalk den-
sity between 2003 and 2004 differed significantly (Tukey’s 
HSD) among density classes with the low and none classes 
being the only similar pair. Neither stem density nor per-
cent cover of Dalmatian toadflax was significantly cor-
related with future toadflax stem density, or with native 
or exotic plant species richness. The number of flowering 
stalks in 2002 was positively correlated with flowering stalks 
in 2003 (r = 0.66, P < 0.001), and 2003 flowering stalk 
density was positively correlated with flower stalks in 
2004 (r = 0.52, P < 0.001). The correlation of 2002 and 
2004 flower stalks was weaker (r = 0.26, P = 0.01).
NATIVE AND EXOTIC SPECIES RESPONSE
Average richness of native plant species was gener-
ally highest in low burn severity plots (6.5 ± 0.2) and lowest 
FIGURE 2. Average Dalmatian toadflax (a) density (stems·m–2), (b) plant 
canopy cover (%), and (c) flowering stalk density (flowering stalks·m–2), by 
year and burn severity class. Line segments within each time step labelled 
with the same letter did not differ significantly among burn severity classes 
(Tukey’s HSD, P > 0.025).

in the high burn severity (4.8 ± 0.1) over the 3 y. Native 
species richness increased each year, except for the high 
burn severity class, which did not show an increase until 
2004 (Figure 4a). The time × burn severity interaction was 
significant for native species richness (P < 0.001), with 
no significant difference among toadflax density classes 
(P = 0.09). The change in native species richness from 
2002 to 2003 and 2003 to 2004 was significantly different 
among some burn severity classes (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01) 
(Figure 4a). In contrast to our hypothesis, richness of exotic 
plant species did not differ significantly among burn severity 
classes, density classes, or time, and there was no interac-
tion effect (P > 0.09), although relatively few exotics other 
than Dalmatian toadflax were encountered (Figure 4b). The 
most frequently occurring exotic species other than toadflax 
was Verbascum thapsus. Other less frequent exotic species 
included Cirsium vulgare, Erodium cicutarium, Bromus tec-
torum, Trifolium repens, and Thinopyrum ponticum.
As expected, native species richness was positively 
correlated with native plant species richness of the previ-
ous year (2003: r = 0.70, P < 0.001 and 2004: r = 0.74, 
P < 0.001), although this relationship was slightly weaker 
across 2 y (r = 0.62, P < 0.001). We chose 6 of the most fre-
quent native plant species to test for an effect of Dalmatian 
toadflax stem density or percent cover on native species 
cover: Elymus elymoides, Festuca arizonica, Muhlenbergia 
montana, Cirsium wheeleri, Erigeron flagellaris, and 
Lupinus argenteus. In contradiction to our hypothesis, we 
did not observe a significant negative correlation between 
density or cover of Dalmatian toadflax and cover of any one 
of these 6 native species (P > 0.05 for all tests).
TRANSITION MATRICES
None of the Dalmatian toadflax control plots (no-toad-
flax) was invaded by toadflax in 2003, and only 2 plots 
were invaded in 2004. However, the 10-m toadflax-free 
buffer zone was invaded by toadflax in 31.5% (24) plots by 
2004. Of these plots, 58% were categorized as high burn 
severity, 17% were moderate severity, 21% were low sever-
ity, and 4% were unburned. Dalmatian toadflax disappeared 
from 6 plots in 2004 in which it had been present in the pre-
vious 2 y; 3 of the plots were unburned and the other 3 were 
burned, one in each burn severity class.
The 4 transition matrices for the 2002 to 2004 transi-
tions corresponding to the 4 classes of burn severity showed 
that the majority of burned plots either remained in their 
original toadflax density class or moved to a higher density 
class in 2004 (Table I), and the percentage of plots moving

sity in 2004, and only 36% of high toadflax density plots 
in unburned areas in 2002 remained in that category in 
2004. In the unburned class, more low-density plots shifted 
to a greater density class (47%), while 39% of medium-
density plots shifted to lower density classes and half 
remained as medium. Since only 2 control plots became 
invaded over the 3 y, the “none” density class remained 
similar in the matrices.
Rate of change (Ȝ) of plots classified as high density 
in 2004 compared to 2002 was stable (Ȝ = 1.0) for moder-
ate- and high-severity burns, but was < 1.0 for both low-
severity burns (Ȝ = 0.98) and unburned (Ȝ = 0.93) plots. 
That is, when transition probabilities from 2002 to 2004 
were held constant for 20 y, projected Ȝ’s indicated an 
initial increase in the proportion of high-density plots on 
moderate- and high-severity burns and then stabilized. In 
contrast, on low burn severity and unburned plots, pro-
jected Ȝ’s for plots classified as high density decreased 
dramatically, and then stabilized at a decreasing rate 
of < 1.0. The projected percentage of high-density plots 
ranged from < 2% for unburned sites to > 61% on high-
severity burn sites (Table II). 
Discussion
Our findings suggest that wildfire areas in northern 
Arizona may be susceptible to the colonization and spread 
of Dalmatian toadflax. The size and frequency of stand-
replacing fires observed in recent years in the southwestern 
US is expected to continue (Swetnam & Baisan, 1996; 
Covington et al., 2001; McKenzie et al., 2004; Schoennagel 
et al., 2005; Westerling et al., 2006), which can facilitate 
forest invasion by exotic species.
Dalmatian toadflax growth and reproduction on areas 
burned by the Leroux Fire were strongly related to burn 
severity and were greatest in high burn severity areas, 
supporting the first research hypothesis. Toadflax density, 
cover, and flowering stalks increased in all burned plots, 
but there was a disproportionately high response in severely 
burned areas. These findings were similar to other stud-
ies in northern Arizona that documented increases of other 
exotic species on high-severity burns (Crawford et al., 
2001; Griffis et al., 2001; Wolfson et al., 2005) and reduced 
native species richness (Griffis et al., 2001). The lack of 
competition from native species and overstory and subse-
quent increased availability of soil moisture and nutrients 
may have contributed to the increased growth of toadflax at 
higher burn severities.
The second research question, addressing toad-
flax density-dependence, had a more complex outcome. 
Unexpectedly, we found that toadflax plants reached a criti-
cal maximum density on the study plots by the second year, 
leading to a decrease in Dalmatian toadflax growth and 
reproduction in the third year. Field observations showed 
that the decline in toadflax density and cover within plots in 
2004 did not necessarily reflect a decline in toadflax infesta-
tion, but rather that toadflax colonized the area outside of 
the plots. The change in interaction between burn sever-
ity and density over time revealed that burn severity was 
the driving factor for increases in toadflax in the first year 
and that stem density was the factor driving the decrease 
of toadflax growth and reproduction in 2004. Toadflax 
may have increased to a density higher than normally 
found under unburned conditions, reached a critical density 
threshold, and then declined to a more sustainable level for 
the species. This may explain why toadflax disappeared 
from 6 previously infested plots in 2004 but was present 
immediately outside the plot frame. Fire effects such as a 
nutrient pulse, litter removal, removal of competing plants, 
increased soil moisture, and increased soil temperature can 
be short-lived, and it is possible that the rapid growth of 
toadflax and subsequent decline was a reflection of these 
transient effects (DeBano, Neary & Ffolliott, 1998). A simi-
lar increase in toadflax biomass 1 y post-fire was described 
by Jacobs and Sheley (2003) and was attributed to a nutrient 
pulse after fire. Similar responses in native species have also 
been attributed to a nutrient release by fire ( Vose & White, 
1991; Phillips & Crisp, 2001). Though initial fire effects 
can be short-lived, they give Dalmatian toadflax a long-term 
competitive advantage that is maintained in following years 
by the higher plant density and seed bank established after 
the fire.
Lambda values, assessing longer-term trends in the 
projected portion of high-density plots, also indicated that 
the proportion of plots in our study population remain-
ing at or moving to high density categories was relatively 
higher on moderately and severely burned sites compared 
to low-severity burned sites and unburned areas 3 y post-
fire. Pauchard, Alaback, and Edlund (2003) found similar 
results in a multi-scale study on invasion patterns of com-
mon toadflax (L. vulgaris): high-density patches tended to 
disperse rather than aggregate, and younger stands tended 
to be clumped while older stands were dispersed, similar 
to the spread observed in our study. Thus, while wildfire 
burn severity patterns can indicate where the greatest initial 
growth and spread of Dalmatian toadflax can occur, longer-
term population increases are determined more by stem 
density. This may cause “hot-spots” for toadflax infestation 
to change over time, requiring flexible management and 
monitoring strategies as time since fire increases.
Since our study design focused on the response of 
plants at a small scale, we could not quantify an increase in 
patch size or actual spread across the landscape. The plant-
centred plots we used provided efficient and accurate mea-
surement of the response of toadflax plants to fire severity. 
However, future studies could employ a nested plot design

Lambda values > 1 indicate an increase in the proportion of plots 
classiied as high density, and values < 1 indicate a decrease in the 
proportion of plots classiied as high density.

to capture both plant- and patch-level responses (Pauchard, 
Alaback & Edlund, 2003).
Native plant species richness increased over time in 
low and moderate burn severity classes, as we hypothesized 
in the third research question, but unexpectedly native 
richness was not significantly negatively correlated with 
Dalmatian toadflax density, indicating that fire severity 
influenced native plant richness to a greater extent than the 
density of toadflax plants. In general, understory species 
in northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests are adapted to 
a low-severity fire regime, which enhances growth, and 
many species rely on fire to reproduce (Vose & White, 
1991; Griffis et al., 2001; Korb & Springer, 2003). Contrary 
to our expectations, exotic species richness did not change 
significantly over time (averaging near 1·m–2) and was not 
significantly correlated with burn severity. This trend is not 
consistent with other studies in northern Arizona (Griffis 
et al., 2001; Crawford et al., 2001) and other regions (e.g., 
Kerns, Theis & Niwa, 2006) that have noted an increase in 
exotic species richness in severely burned sites. Instead, we 
found exotic species well distributed across our plots, and 
the list included species designated as “noxious” in one or 
more southwestern states (Sieg, Phillips & Moser, 2003): 
Verbascum thapsus, Cirsium vulgare, Erodium cicutarium, 
and Bromus tectorum, plus a number of species used in 
seed mixes in this region, such as Thinopyrum ponticum 
and Trifolium repens. Although our study took place in a 
designated Wilderness area, extensive logging, seeding, and 
livestock grazing had occurred before the site was set aside 
as wilderness, presumably leaving a legacy of toadflax and 
other exotic species seeds in the soil seed bank. In contrast, 
exotics did not dominate after a fairly severe fire at Grand 
Canyon National Park, possibly because of the lack of a 
previous history of logging and livestock grazing (Huisinga 
et al., 2005). Stohlgren et al. (1999) reported that native and 
exotic species richness were positively correlated across 
a broad geographic region, suggesting that invasion may 
be favoured in areas of high native diversity. Our results 
showed no relationship between Dalmatian toadflax vari-
ables and native species richness, but our plant-centred plot 
methods were focused on toadflax and therefore were not 
the best suited for measuring native plant presence across 
the larger landscape, in contrast to the randomly located 
plots of Stohlgren et al. (1999).
MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS
Concerns over severe wildfire and exotic species inva-
sion are increasingly common in pine and pine–oak ecosys-
tems worldwide, not only in the USA and Canada (Vujnovic 
& Wein, 1996) but also in Mexico (Rodríguez-Trejo & 
Fulé, 2003), Central America, and the Mediterranean Basin 
(Leone & Lovreglio, 2004). Fire occurrence and sever-
ity have increased with climate and fuel changes in recent 
decades (Pausas, 2004; Westerling et al., 2006). For manag-
ers and ecologists engaged in treatments to reduce forest 
vulnerability to severe fire or to rehabilitate post-wildfire 
ecosystems, the patterns of Dalmatian toadflax that we 
observed in Arizona may be relevant in other areas with the 
same species (western North America), other toadflax spe-
cies such as Linaria vulgaris, or other invasive plants in the 
Scrophulariaceae (e.g., Verbascum thapsus).
Our results indicate that severe fire may facilitate 
Dalmatian toadflax spread in the first 2 y after fire, and 
that control efforts should be focused on high and moderate 
burn severity areas. Although toadflax increases were high-
est on high burn severity plots, toadflax stem densities also 
increased over the 3 y on low-severity burn plots; thus, even 
low-severity fires can promote toadflax invasion. Other 
disturbances can also promote Dalmatian toadflax spread, 
including fuel reduction treatments, which can disturb soils 
through tree thinning; prescribed burning; and slash pile 
burning (Jacobs & Sheley, 2003; Wolfson et al., 2005; Korb, 
Johnson & Covington, 2004). Our results show that even at 
lower fire severities typical of prescribed fires, Dalmatian 
toadflax is capable of spreading.
Stem density is another factor for prioritizing toadflax 
control efforts. Since toadflax density appears to self-regu-
late by spreading outward after reaching a maximum critical 
threshold, the treatment of lower density areas along the 
periphery of a toadflax patch or satellite plants may be 
effective at reducing spread. This approach would reduce 
the amount of land area being directly treated while still 
treating the overall infested area, therefore alleviating time 
and cost constraints faced by land managers.
While toadflax control priorities are supported by 
data on the spread of this species, there is a great need for 
research on the effectiveness of different treatment meth-
ods, timing of treatment on toadflax production, and tim-
ing of treatment on carbohydrate root reserves in order to 
treat toadflax infestations more efficiently. Research is also 
needed to see if conducting weed control (pulling, chemical, 
or clipping) before initiating prescribed fire would reduce 
the amount of stored resources available for resprouting and 
minimize seed dispersal. Additional post-fire control might 
be useful to remove seedlings that are stimulated by the dis-
turbance and resprouting adults. Other studies have found 
that Dalmatian toadflax seedlings are susceptible to com-
petition before roots become established, so establishment 
of cool season native plants may provide sufficient com-
petition to prevent toadflax seedling survival (Lajeunesse, 
1999). The effectiveness of weed control treatments and 
toadflax population response should be monitored annually 
or more frequently (spring and fall), if possible. The failure 
of managers to treat any exotic species prior to fuel reduc-
tion or restoration treatments and after wildfire can result in 
trading one undesirable condition for another (Sieg, Phillips 
& Moser, 2003).
