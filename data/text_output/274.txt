Abstract
In recent times, pinyon (Pinus spp.)-juniper (Juniperus spp.)
woodlands have expanded into large portions of the Southwest
historically occupied by grassland vegetation. From 1997–1998,
we studied responses of breeding birds to one-seed juniper (J.
monosperma) woodland expansion at 2 grassland study areas in
northern Arizona. We sampled breeding birds in 3 successional
stages along a grassland-woodland gradient: un-invaded grass-
land, grassland undergoing early stages of juniper establishment,
and developing woodland. Species composition varied greatly
among successional stages and was most different between end-
points of the gradient. Ground-nesting grassland species predom-
inated in uninvaded grassland but declined dramatically as tree
density increased. Tree- and cavity-nesting species increased with
tree density and were most abundant in developing woodland.
Restoration of juniper-invaded grasslands will benefit grassland-
obligate birds and other wildlife.

Since European settlement, pinyon (Pinus spp.)-juniper
(Juniperus spp.) woodlands have expanded into large portions of
the southwestern U.S. historically occupied by grassland (Miller
1921, Leopold 1951, Johnsen 1962, Rogers et al. 1984,
Cinnamon 1988). Livestock grazing and fire suppression com-
monly are cited as causes of woodland expansion (Johnsen 1962,
West 1984). Other factors linked to woodland expansion include
climate change, long-term biogeographic patterns, and tree
reestablishment following harvest by aboriginal Americans
(Samuels and Betancourt 1982, Betancourt 1987, Jameson 1987). 
The effects of juniper woodland expansion on wildlife have
received little study and are not well understood. Because grass-
land birds are closely tied to habitat structure (Rotenberry and
Wiens 1980, Wiens and Rotenberry 1981, Cody 1985), invasion
of woody vegetation has serious implications for grassland avi-
fauna (Knopf 1994). A better understanding of wildlife responses
to woodland expansion will help resource managers design effec-
tive treatments and restoration programs for grassland and wood-
land habitats (Loftin et al. 1995).
Our objective in this study was to quantify effects of juniper
woodland expansion on breeding bird communities in cold-tem-
perate grasslands of northern Arizona. We predicted that develop-
ment of woodland vegetation in grassland habitats would alter the
breeding avifauna, with effects at both the community and
species levels.
Materials and Methods
Study Areas
The study was conducted at 2 areas in northern Arizona, repre-
senting the transition zone between Plains and Great Basin grass-
lands (Brown 1982). Grasslands at both areas were undergoing
succession to one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma (Engelm.)
Sarg.) woodland and had not received treatments intended to con-
trol woody vegetation (e.g., herbicide application, prescribed fire,
tree cutting, or mechanical control).
The Chevelon study area is located 38 km southeast of
Winslow, Arizona (Lat 35° 40' N, Long 110° 45' W). Elevations
range from 1,834–1,901 m, with annual precipitation averaging
20.4 cm. Soils are derived from limestone and sandstone parent

Res men
En tiempos recientes, bosques de piñón (Pinus spp.) y enebro
(Juniperus spp.) han invadido porciones grandes del Suroeste
históricamente ocupadas por vegetación de prado. De 1997-
1998, estudiamos el efecto de la expansión de bosque de enebro
(J. monosperma) sobre una comunidad reproductiva de aves en
2 áreas de estudio en el norte de Arizona. Examinamos la
comunidad de aves en 3 etapas de sucesión a lo largo de una
gradiente de pradera-bosque: pradera no-invadida, pradera
sujeta a etapas iniciales de establecimiento por enebro, y
bosque en desarrollo. La composición de especies varió bas-
tante entre etapas de sucesión pero la mayor variación ocurrió
entre extremos del gradiente. Especies que anidan en el suelo
de praderas predominaron en praderas no-invadidas, pero dis-
minuyeron dramáticamente al aumentar la densidad de
árboles. Especies que anidan en árboles y en cavidades aumen-
taron con mayor densidad de árboles y ocurrieron en mayor
abundancia en bosque en desarrollo. La restauración de
praderas invadidas por enebros será de beneficio para las aves,
y otra vida silvestre, que dependen de praderas.

materials. Dominant grass species include
blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis (H.B.K.)
Lag.), ring muhly (Muhlenbergia tor-
reyana (Kunth) Hitchc.), and bottlebrush
squirreltail (Sitanion hystrix (Nutt.) J.G.
Smith). Scattered shrubs were present, pri-
marily four-wing saltbush (Atriplex
canescens (Pursh) Nutt.), Bigelow sage-
brush (Artemisia bigelovii Gray), and
Fremont barberry (Berberis fremontii
Torr.). Colorado pinyon (Pinus edulis
Engelm.) was present on widely scattered
microsites with shallow, rocky soils. The
area was grazed each year by cattle and
horses, primarily during winter and spring.
The Wupatki study area is located in the
north-central portion of Wupatki National
Monument, 48 km northeast of Flagstaff,
Ariz. (Lat 35° 35' N, Long 111° 28' W).
Elevations range from 1,591–1,645 m, with
annual precipitation averaging 20.0 cm.
Soils are derived from limestone and sand-
stone parent materials, overlain by a layer
of volcanic cinders. Dominant grass species
include needle-and-thread (Stipa comata
Trin. and Rupr.), blue grama, galleta
(Hilaria jamesii (Torr.) Benth.), black
grama (B. eriopoda Torr.), and alkali saca-
ton (Sporobolus airoides Torr.). Shrubs
were relatively sparse, consisting largely of
rubber rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus nau-
seosus (Pall.) Britton). Livestock have been
excluded from Wupatki for ca. 20 years.
Sampling Design
We used aerial photos and ground sur-
veys to identify and map grassland-wood-
land successional stages present on both
study areas. Because juniper reproduction
tends to occur as discrete, episodic events
(Arnold et al. 1964), we delineated succes-
sional stages based upon overall physiog-
nomy of the existing plant community,
i.e., grass cover, tree size, and tree density.
To minimize effects of environmental het-
erogeneity, we only mapped uniform veg-
etation types that were >100 ha in size,
avoiding transition zones between succes-
sional stages.
Three successional stages were present
on the study areas: (1) un-invaded grass-
land without juniper; (2) grassland under-
going early stages of juniper establish-
ment, with scattered small junipers; and
(3) developing woodland with abundant
larger trees (Table 1). At both study areas,
we randomly selected 4 replicate stands
within each successional stage for bird and
habitat sampling. 
Bird Sampling
We used distance sampling (Buckland et
al. 1993) to estimate breeding bird abun-
dance. Within each stand, we randomly
located a 1-km transect containing 5 sam-
pling points spaced 250 m apart. Each
point was sampled 3 times during June
1997 and June 1998, once by each of 3
observers. Count duration was 5-min per
point. Sampling visits occurred 7–9 days
apart, during a 2-hour period beginning at
sunrise. Counts were not done during peri-
ods of rain or strong wind. Observers
received extensive training in bird identifi-
cation and distance estimation prior to
field work (Kepler and Scott 1981). We
collected distance measurements as
grouped data (Buckland et al. 1993:110),
where each bird detection was placed into
1 of 6 distance intervals (0-5 m, 6-10m,
11-25 m, 26-50 m, 51-125 m, and >125
m). Observers used laser rangefinders and
marker flags placed at known distances to
assist in accurate distance estimation.
Habitat Sampling
Cover of herbaceous and shrub vegeta-
tion was measured on twenty, 50-m point-
intercept transects, randomly located along
each transect. Tree density and tree height
were measured in a 4 X 50 m plot centered
on the long axis of the intercept transect.
Herbaceous vegetation was sampled each
year. Trees and shrubs were sampled once
during 1997.
Data Analysis
We used program DISTANCE (Thomas
et al. 1999) to estimate bird density.
Analyses were done only for species with
>50 detections. Because sample sizes were
small, we pooled all detections to fit a
common detection function, then used this
function to derive density estimates for
individual transects within years (Buckland
et al. 1993:74). Candidate models were
evaluated using Akaike’s Information
Criterion (AIC), X2 goodness of fit statis-
tics, and visual inspection of probability
density functions fitted by DISTANCE.
We used Jaccard’s index (J) (Ludwig
and Reynolds 1988) to assess similarity in
bird species composition among stands
representing different stages of woodland
expansion. We also tallied proportions of
species that belonged to each of 4 nesting
guilds (ground, shrub, tree, or tree cavity).
Guild classifications were based upon
Ehrlich et al. (1988) and observational
data collected during this study. 
Species richness was estimated using a
jackknife estimator (Burnham and
Overton 1978), as implemented in pro-
gram COMDYN (Nichols et al. 1996).
This estimator is an extension of mark-
recapture theory and incorporates hetero-
geneity in species’ detectability across mul-
tiple sampling events (Nichols et al. 1998).
We used Repeated Measures Analysis
of Variance (Neter at al. 1990:1035) to
test for overall differences in bird response
variables among successional stages. If
stage effects were significant (P < 0.05),
and stage X year interactions were not pre-
sent (P > 0.05), we used Scheffe’s post-
hoc test to compare mean values among
individual stages (Zar 1984:196).
Differences among stages were considered
significant at P ≤0.05. Data from the 2
study areas were analyzed separately,
because of substantial edaphic differences
affecting understory vegetation, woodland
succession and potentially, breeding birds.
Habitat characteristics among successional
stages were summarized as means and
associated standard errors; hypothesis tests
on these data would have little value, as
null hypotheses were known to be false a-
priori (Johnson 1999).
Results
Habitat Characteristics
Habitat characteristics differed among
successional stages at both sites. Habitat
differences were most prevalent in the tree
component, with one-seed juniper absent

in un-invaded grassland, but increasingly
abundant in early establishment and devel-
oping woodland conditions (Table 1). Tree
density was highest in developing wood-
land, with mean values of 92 and 42
trees/ha at Chevelon and Wupatki, respec-
tively. Tree size also increased along the
grassland-woodland gradient. The largest
trees were present in developing wood-
land, averaging 2.7 and 3.4 m in height at
Chevelon and Wupatki, respectively.
Fewer differences were apparent in the
grass and shrub components. Grass cover
and height were greater at Wupatki than at
Chevelon, but values were similar among
stages within sites (Table 2). At Chevelon,
shrub cover decreased along the grassland-
woodland gradient, but shrubs (primarily
Fremont barberry) were much taller in the
developing woodland stage. At Wupatki,
shrub cover increased and shrub height
decreased with woodland succession.
Breeding Bird Community Attributes
A total of 22 bird species was detected,
21 at Chevelon and 17 at Wupatki (Table
3). Most species occurred in 1 or 2 of the 3
successional stages present at each area.
Composition of the breeding avifauna
changed dramatically with woodland
expansion. Values of J ranged from
0.11–0.40 and 0.13–0.52 at Chevelon and
Wupatki, respectively (Table 4). At both
sites, endpoints of the successional gradi-
ent (un-invaded grassland versus develop-
ing woodland) had the fewest species in
common. The greatest degree of overlap
was found between un-invaded grassland
and developing woodland at the Chevelon
area, and between early establishment and
developing woodland at Wupatki.
Species richness increased with wood-
land expansion, ranging from 4.4–19.5
and 3.0–10.5, at Chevelon and Wupatki,
respectively (Fig. 1). Richness differed
among stages at both sites (Chevelon: F2,9
= 493.79, P < 0.0001; Wupatki: F2,9 =
30.37, P ≤0.0001), and was lowest in un-
invaded grassland and highest in develop-
ing woodland. Species richness was sig-
nificantly different between un-invaded
grassland and developing woodland at
both sites. Species richness was not signif-
icantly different in un-invaded grassland
and early establishment woodland at
Chevelon, but did differ at the Wupatki
area. Richness differed in early establish-
ment and developing woodland at
Chevelon but did not differ at Wupatki.
Bird community composition changed
dramatically along the grassland-wood-
land gradient. The proportion of ground-
nesting species differed among all stages
at both sites (Chevelon: F2,9 = 43.1, P ≤
0.0001; Wupatki: F2,9 = 99.61, P ≤
0.0001). Ground-nesters predominated in
un-invaded grassland, but decreased
sharply with increasing tree density (Fig.
2). The proportion of tree-nesting species
also differed among all stages at both sites
(Chevelon: F2,9 = 60.27, P ≤0.0001;
Wupatki: F2,9 = 126.59, P ≤0.0001).
Tree-nesters represented the bulk of the
avifauna in developing woodland, but still
were well-represented in early establish-
ment woodland at both sites. Cavity-nest-
ing species were relatively uncommon at
Wupatki and did not differ among stages
(F2,9 = 2.38, P = 0.15). Cavity-nesters
made up a greater proportion of the avi-
fauna at Chevelon and varied among
stages (F2,9 = 46.20, P ≤0.0001). Like
tree nesters, cavity-nesting species were
most common in developing woodland
and rare or absent in earlier successional
stages. Proportions of shrub-nesting
species did not vary significantly among
stages at either area (Chevelon: F2,9 =
4.13, P = 0.053; Wupatki: F2,9 = 4.07, P =
0.054).
Bird Abundance
The majority of bird species occurred in
relatively low numbers; only 12 species
were detected often enough for density

estimation. Three ground-nesting grass-
land species were most strongly associated
with un-invaded grassland and early estab-
lishment stages (Tables 5 and 6). Eastern
and western meadowlarks were found in
un-invaded grassland and early establish-
ment woodland at Chevelon, and in all 3
successional stages at Wupatki. At both
sites, meadowlarks were most abundant in
early establishment woodlands. Horned
larks were present in all successional
stages at both sites, but were most abun-
dant in un-invaded grassland. One ground-
nesting species (spotted towhee) was pre-
sent only in developing woodland at
Chevelon.
We obtained density estimates for 1
shrub-nesting species present in early
establishment and developing woodlands.
At Chevelon, lark sparrows were present
in all stages and were most abundant in
developing woodland. At Wupatki, lark
sparrows were found in early establish-
ment and developing woodland, and were
most abundant in the latter.
Six tree-nesting species had adequate
sample sizes to estimate density. These
species were largely restricted to develop-
ing woodland at Chevelon, but did occur
in early establishment woodland at
Wupatki. Common bushtits were present
only in developing woodland at both sites.
Chipping sparrows were found only in
developing woodland at Chevelon.
Northern mockingbirds were present in all
successional stages at Chevelon, but only
in early establishment and developing
woodland at Wupatki. At both sites,
mockingbirds were most abundant in
developing woodland. At Wupatki,
mourning doves were similarly abundant
in early establishment and developing
woodland. Pinyon jays were found only in
developing woodland at Chevelon and
were equally abundant in early establish-
ment and developing woodland at
Wupatki. Scott’s orioles were found in
early establishment and developing wood-
land at both sites, but were most abundant
in the latter. Cavity-nesting species were
largely restricted to developing woodland.
Ash-throated flycatchers were present in
developing woodland at both sites.
Bewick’s wren occurred in early establish-
ment and developing woodland at the
Chevelon area, being most abundant in the
latter successional stage.
Discussion
Woodland expansion had a strong and
consistent influence on grassland avifauna.
Ground-nesting grassland species predom-
inated in un-invaded grassland, but
declined as tree density increased. The
proportion of tree- and cavity-nesting
species increased with woodland succes-
sion and was highest in developing wood-
land. Shrub-nesters did not respond to
woodland expansion, probably because
shrubs were relatively sparse on our study

areas, and shrub density and shrub size
were similar among successional stages.
The breeding avifauna changed dramati-
cally with woodland succession; differ-
ences were most pronounced between end-
points of our gradient (un-invaded grass-
land versus developing woodland).
Differences in species composition within
successional woodlands appeared propor-
tional to the magnitude of change in the
tree component. For example, at the
Chevelon area, tree density increased by
nearly an order of magnitude between
early establishment and developing wood-
land, and species overlap was low (J =
0.25). In contrast, there was only a 4-fold
difference in tree density between these
stages at Wupatki, and species overlap
was much higher (J = 0.52). Studies in
other North American grasslands also
have reported substantial avifaunal
changes in response to woodland expan-
sion. In southern Arizona, invasion of
mesquite (Prosopis spp.) increased breed-
ing bird species richness, but decreased
habitat suitability for several grassland
species (Lloyd et al. 1998). Shelterbelt
plantings in the Great Plains and midwest-
ern U.S. have been colonized by bird
species historically associated with savan-
na and deciduous forests (Martin 1981,
Yahner 1983, Knopf 1994).
The avian community changes that we
observed were consistent with results of
previous studies in northern Arizona.
LaRue (1994) reported that horned larks
and meadowlarks were the dominant
breeding species on mined areas revegetat-
ed to grassland, whereas juniper-invaded
grasslands supported tree-nesting species
including northern mockingbirds, logger-
head shrikes, chipping sparrows, and
Scott’s orioles. Prior breeding bird surveys
at Wupatki found 17 species (primarily
tree-nesters) at a juniper savannah area,
compared to 8 species at a grassland area
(Beatty 1978). Within Southwestern piny-
on-juniper woodlands, breeding bird
diversity and abundance have been posi-
tively correlated with tree density and tree
size (Masters 1979, Sedgwick 1987,
LaRue 1994). 
The inverse of the woodland expansion
pattern has been found in studies of breed-
ing birds in treated pinyon-juniper wood-
lands; where fire, herbicides, and mechan-
ical treatments have been used to create
openings dominated by herbaceous and
shrub vegetation. Treated areas were dom-
inated by ground-nesting and grassland
bird species (Grue 1977, Kruse et al. 1979,
LaRue 1994). Diversity was highest in
undisturbed woodlands and at woodland
edges adjacent to treated areas (O’Meara
et al. 1981, Sedgwick and Ryder 1987).
Foliage and cavity nesting species were
more abundant in or restricted to untreated
or lightly treated woodlands (Sedgwick
and Ryder 1987, La Rue 1994).
Responses of breeding birds to wood-
land expansion likely are driven by link-
ages between individual species and floris-
tic and physiognomic habitat features
(Rotenberry and Wiens 1980, Wiens and
Rotenberry 1981, Cody 1985). The addi-
tion of a tree component provides nesting
and foraging opportunities for woodland
species, but reduces habitat suitability for
grassland-obligate birds. The presence of
woody vegetation may further influence
community structure by altering predation
risk for “cover-dependent” versus “cover-
independent” bird species (Lima and
Valone 1991). 
Conclusions and Management
Recommendations
Woodland expansion is an important
issue in Southwestern grasslands, particu-
larly on public lands (Loftin et al. 1995).
While the grassland bird species that we
studied are not currently listed as threat-
ened, endangered, or “species of concern,”
continued expansion of juniper in northern
Arizona grasslands will result in addition-
al, substantial habitat change over the
long-term and reductions in the numbers
of grassland-obligate birds. 
Our results suggest that removal or
reduction of invasive juniper will improve
breeding habitat for horned larks, mead-
owlarks, and other grassland-obligate
birds in northern Arizona. Grassland
restoration would likely benefit other
wildlife species.  Juniper woodland expan-
sion has been found to decrease habitat
quality for pronghorn (Antilocapra ameri-
cana Ord) and increase susceptibility to
predation (Alexander and Ockenfels 1994,
R. Ockenfels, Arizona Game and Fish
Dept., pers. comm.). Anecdotal observa-
tions made during this study also suggest
that woodland expansion is detrimental to
Gunnison’s prairie dogs (Cynomys gun-
nisoni Baird).  Active prairie dog towns
were present on or near all transects in un-
invaded grassland, but were absent in suc-
cessional woodlands.
Several factors should be considered by
resource managers planning grassland
restoration projects. True “restoration” is
likely possible only in areas along the
grassland-woodland interface that histori-
cally were occupied by grassland vegeta-
tion. Type conversions in higher elevation
“true” pinyon-juniper woodlands are
expensive and generally have short-lived
effects. A density of ≥10 juniper trees ha-1
is an approximate threshold at which habi-

tat suitability for grassland species
declines and at which restoration treat-
ments should be considered. Priority should
be given to sites that have a well-estab-
lished perennial grass component, as artifi-
cial seeding and surface treatments needed
to establish grasses will greatly inflate pro-
ject cost. Artificial seeding may be difficult
or impractical where upper soil horizons
have been lost to erosion.  Shrubs that pro-
vide nesting cover and song perches for
breeding birds (e.g., four-wing saltbush and
Fremont barberry) should be retained; how-
ever, where shrubs are rare or absent, a low
density (2-4 trees/ha) of small (< 1.5 m tall)
junipers may be left on the site.
