ABSTRACT 
MAPPED PERMANENT QUADRATS: A WINDOW THROUGH TIME 
INTO HERBACEOUS PLANT DEMOGRAPHY 
HELEN E. DOWLING 
Long-term spatially explicit mapped datasets of herbaceous plant 
population dynamics are rare and intrinsically valuable beyond measure.  These 
types of data can provide vital information to address key ecological questions 
related to plant demography, population and community responses to climate and 
anthropogenic modifications across the landscape.  The long-term historical 
dataset, which is the focus of this thesis, provides examples of the ecological 
value of data derived from long-term permanent chart quadrats. 
In Chapter 2, I provide metadata from a long-term dataset that consists of 
98 permanent 1-m2 quadrats located in the ponderosa pine-bunchgrass ecosystem 
surrounding Flagstaff, Arizona, USA.  Individual plants in these quadrats were 
identified and mapped annually from 2002-2014.  Original quadrats were 
established in 1912-1927 and were mapped sporadically until 1940.  Quadrats 
were located in ungrazed exclosures and in pastures grazed at various intensities 
by livestock.  I provide the following data and data formats: (1) high-resolution 
image files (*.tiff); (2) the digitized maps in shapefile format; (3) a tabular 
representation of centroid or point location (x, y coordinates), and basal cover for 
plants mapped as polygons; (4) a species list including the total records for each 
species; (5) quadrat inventory of the years each quadrat was sampled; (6) quadrat 
information including GPS coordinates and elevation; and (7) monthly 

iii 
precipitation and temperature records. The metadata results (data products) will 
be published in research archives.  In addition, data from these permanent chart 
quadrats will be used to determine species-specific vital rates in Chapter 4. 
In Chapter 3, I developed an electronic field data collection method to 
remap the herbaceous vegetation on the chart quadrats described above.  The 
method uses ESRI ArcMap to collect plant data on field computers, which: (1) 
creates a digital data capture system; (2) allows the ability to search and 
manipulate the data from directly in the field; (3) allows for a visual display of the 
previous year’s data map for reference in the field; (4) reduces the likelihood of 
data transposition errors; and (5) removes the need to digitize maps from paper 
copies.  I tested the electronic field data collection method against the traditional 
paper mapping method to assess the efficiency of each method.  The electronic 
data collection method increased the amount of time necessary to map the 
vegetation on each quadrat, however, the electronic method significantly 
diminished the amount of time needed to process each quadrat in the office.  
Implementing the electronic method can reduce the amount of time and resources 
needed to annually re-map permanent chart quadrats. 
In Chapter 4, I used detailed local climate variables and data from the 
annually remapped data set (2002-2014) described above to examine the effects 
of climate on the demographic rates of a dominant graminoid, Arizona fescue 
(Festuca arizonica Vasey).  I constructed life tables to examine vital rates (e.g., 
survival probabilities, growth, and life expectancies) for this focal species.  I 
made population projections using the species’ state (size) and precipitation 

iv 
variables using Integral Projection Models (IPMs) to quantify the direct influence 
of seasonal precipitation on the vital rates of this dominant perennial bunchgrass.  
We found that altering the size structure of the population of Arizona 
fescue can increase life span by increasing the number of individuals belonging to 
the larger size classes with higher probabilities of survival.  Furthermore, we 
found that the survival and growth of Arizona fescue was strongly linked with 
winter and spring precipitation, respectively. 
In summary, in this thesis I compiled metadata from a historical dataset, 
developed an electronic field capture method, and used these data to examine the 
demographic rates of a dominant bunchgrass species in northern Arizona.  
Gaining a better understanding of the climatic factors that drive plant populations 
will allow land managers to make informed decisions regarding land-use practices 
and the implementation of restoration treatments in the Southwest.  In an era 
characterized by anthropogenic climate and land-use change, understanding the 
impacts these changes may have on forest ecosystems is crucial in our effort to 
anticipate how plant communities may respond over time.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 
Understanding how plant population dynamics are influenced by climate 
variation is a classic ecological inquiry that has taken on a new level of urgency in 
an era of anthropogenic climate and land-use change (Dalgleish et al. 2011, Adler 
et al. 2012, Chu et al. 2014).  The future of ecosystem conservation and 
management will rely on our ability to accurately forecast the ecological impact 
of these changes and predict species interactions and community level responses 
over time (Adler et al. 2012).  
Since Euro-American settlement, fire suppression and grazing practices 
have significantly increased tree densities in southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus 
ponderosa Laws. var. scopolorum Engelm.) dominated forests.  Figure 1.1 
illustrates the dramatic divergence between current forest structure and the forest 
structure that was characteristic of pre-settlement southwestern ponderosa pine 
forests.  Time series photos (Fig. 1.1) document the effects of anthropogenic 
modifications (i.e., grazing, fire suppression) that are present throughout our 
entire study area.  This shift in forest structure coupled with the absence of fire 
has profoundly impacted the herbaceous understory in these formerly frequent-
fire ecosystems (Covington and Moore 1994a, 1994b).  Many studies have 
addressed the impacts of anthropogenic modifications on plant communities; 
however, few studies have addressed the impact of climate change on herbaceous 
plant population dynamics.  
Understanding how communities have responded to past climatic variation 
provides a method of predicting community level responses to future climate 

2 
change (Dalgleish et al. 2011).  Fluctuations in temperature and precipitation 
common in the American Southwest are predicted to increase and have the 
potential to disrupt plant life cycles (Lenart et al. 2007).  Projections based on the 
results of 19 global climate models suggest that the Southwest’s immediate future 
will likely resemble the severe drought of 2002 and possibly last for many 
consecutive years (Lenart et al. 2007).  It is evident that plant species have 
responded differently to recent shifts in climate, yet how they may respond to 
future climate change remains unknown.  
Our ability to accurately predict plant population dynamics is hindered in 
part by a lack of empirical demographic data (Lauenroth and Adler 2008).  For 
the majority of plant species in the Southwest, data pertaining to population 
demographic rates remains unknown.  Mapping individual plants over time is the 
most accurate method of determining demographic parameters for herbaceous 
plant species (Lauenroth and Adler 2008).  In this thesis, I used a long-term data 
set from within the ponderosa pine-bunchgrass ecosystem of the Southwest that 
contains the best data available to investigate the demography of a dominant 
perennial bunchgrass.  This network of fine-grained (1-m2) permanent plots was 
remeasured annually from 2002-2014, for a total of 13 consecutive years.  These 
chart quadrats were originally established by R. R. Hill, C.K. Cooperrider, H.O. 
Cassidy, and G.A. Pearson between 1912 and 1927 on the Coconino National 
Forest and Fort Valley Experimental Forest.  They provide a unique opportunity 
to examine the influence of climate change on the demography of plant 

3 
populations in the southwestern ponderosa pine bunchgrass ecosystem (Bakker 
and Moore 2007, Bakker et al. 2008, Laughlin et al. 2009, Strahan et al. 2015).  
The objectives of my thesis were to: (1) continue the annual mapping of 
these permanent quadrats and further contribute to this scientific legacy; (2) 
maintain and prepare this large and valuable ecological dataset for publication in 
Ecological Archives (Chapter 2); (3) develop digital methods for more efficient 
field data collection and entry of chart quadrat data (Chapter 3); (4) determine the 
demographic rates (e.g., survival, growth, and life expectancy) of Arizona fescue, 
a dominant graminoid species (Chapter 4); and (5) quantify the direct influence of 
seasonal precipitation using an Integral Projection Model (IPM) (Chapter 4).  My 
goal is to provide a better understanding of the climatic factors that drive plant 
species populations on so that land managers can make informed decisions 
regarding land-use practices in the Southwest and in the implementation of 
restoration treatments across the landscape.

CHAPTER 2: 
MAPPED CHART QUADRATS IN SOUTHWESTERN PONDEROSA PINE-
BUNCHGRASS ECOSYSTEMS: LONG-TERM DATA FOR ANALYZING 
HERBACEOUS PLANT DYNAMICS 
Abstract 
This historical data set consists of a series of 98 permanent 1-m2 chart 
quadrats from within the ponderosa pine-bunchgrass ecosystems of northern 
Arizona, USA.  We relocated these chart quadrats and remapped all individual 
plants in each quadrat annually from 2002-2014.  The temporal and spatial data 
provide unique opportunities to examine the effects of climate and land-use 
variables on plant demography, population and community processes.  The 
original chart quadrats were established between 1912 and 1927 to determine the 
effects of livestock grazing on herbaceous plants and pine seedlings.  We briefly 
describe the three distinct historical studies that led to the establishment of this 
larger network of 98 permanent quadrats.  
We provide the following data and data formats: (1) high-resolution image 
files (*.tiff); (2) the digitized maps in shapefile format; (3) a tabular 
representation of centroid or point location (x, y coordinates); and basal cover for 
species mapped as polygons; (4) a species list including the total records for each 
species, (5) quadrat inventory of the years each quadrat was sampled; (6) quadrat 
information including GPS coordinates and elevation; and (7) monthly 
precipitation and temperature records.

Introduction 
Our ability to accurately predict plant population dynamics is hindered in 
part by a lack of empirical demographic data (Laurenroth and Adler 2008).  For 
the majority of the herbaceous plant species in the Southwest, data pertaining to 
demographic rates and population dynamics is virtually unknown.  Mapping 
individual plants over time is the most accurate method of determining 
demographic parameters for herbaceous plant species (Laurenroth and Adler 
2008).  These temporal and spatial data derived from mapped chart quadrats 
provide unique opportunities to examine the effects of climate and land-use 
variables on plant demography, population, and community processes. 
Mapped chart quadrats were originally designed and popularized by 
Clements (1905) to assess the composition and structure of plant communities.  
Networks of chart quadrats were widely established in the western U.S. 
rangelands in the 1900s.  They are fine-grained permanent quadrats and maps 
showing the location of individual plants.  In the past, chart quadrat data have 
been used to analyze plant demography (Albertson and Tomanek 1965, 
Laurenroth and Adler 2008), and there is a renewed interest in relocating and 
remapping permanent chart quadrats because of their tremendous importance for 
ecological theory (Adler et al 2006,), vegetation response to climate change 
(Adler et al 2012, Yao et al 2006), soil processes (Gill 2007), and questions 
regarding bet hedging (Gremmer and Veneable 2014), and biodiversity (Adler 
and Laurenroth 2003, White et al. 2006, Adler and Levine 2007).  Much of what 

6 
we know about demographics, population, and community dynamics of 
herbaceous plants in the Southwest has come from chart quadrats such as these.  
The chart quadrats that are the foci of this metadata consists of a series of 
98 permanent 1-m2 chart quadrats from within the ponderosa pine-bunchgrass 
ecosystems in northern Arizona, USA.  All of these quadrats are located within 40 
km of Flagstaff, AZ (Figure 2.1) and are distributed over multiple sites spanning 
700 km2 of varying soil type, topography, and spanning the elevational range of 
the ponderosa pine-bunchgrass type on the Coconino National Forest and Fort 
Valley Experimental Forest in northern Arizona (Bakker and Moore 2007, 
Laughlin et al. 2011, Strahan et al. 2015).  The precise locations of corners and 
boundaries for ninety-eight quadrats remain permanently marked (tagged angle 
iron or galvanized steel pipe corners) in the field.  During each growing season, 
all plants found on these quadrats are identified, remapped, and digitized into 
geographic information systems to facilitate calculations of individual plant and 
total basal cover and density (Laughlin and Moore 2008).  
Original Chart Quadrats from Three Historical Studies 
The chart quadrats archived in this database were originally established by 
R.R. Hill, C.K. Cooperrider, H.O. Cassidy, and G.A. Pearson between 1912 and 
1927 on the Coconino National Forest and Fort Valley Experimental Forest.  
Initially established to examine: (1) the effects of grazing on the herbaceous plant 
community, (2) grass competition with pine seedling establishment, and (3) initial 
patterns of plant succession.  We provide a brief description, background and 
literature for each study.  The original hand drawn chart quadrat maps, plus 

7 
original photographs and the summaries from all three studies, are stored in the 
FVEF Archives at the Rocky Mountain Research Station (RMRS) in Flagstaff 
(http://www.rmrs.nau.edu/fortvalley). 
R. R. Hill became the first United States Forest Service (USFS) Grazing 
Examiner for District 3 (now Region 3) in 1908.  He initiated a study on the 
Coconino National Forest to examine potential livestock damage to ponderosa 
pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws. var. scopolorum Engelm.) regeneration as well as 
determine how the understory vegetation recovers when protected from livestock 
grazing in 1912 (Hill 1917, Hill 1920, Talbot and Hill 1923, Glendening 1941, 
Arnold 1950, Arnold 1955, Bakker 2005, Bakker et al. 2008).  Under Hill’s 
direction, livestock exclosures (0.6 ha) were built at 5 sites on the Coconino 
National Forest. At each site, 10 1-m2 chart quadrats were established, five inside 
and five outside the exclosures.  Vegetation on these 50 chart quadrats was 
mapped periodically between 1912 and 1948 before the project ended and their 
data archived at the Fort Valley Experimental Forest.  This study is known locally 
as the “Hill Plots” in recognition of R.R. Hill and these quadrats have been 
mapped annually since 2002 (Bakker 2005, Bakker et al. 2008, Laughlin 2009, 
Laughlin et al 2011, Strahan 2013, Strahan et al. 2015) and are labelled according 
to their site name, such as “Black Springs”, “Rogers Lake”, etc. 
In 1909, G. A. Pearson, Director, USFS Fort Valley Experimental Forest 
(FVEF), together with T.S. Woolsey Jr. drafted a set of instructions that led to the 
establishment of a network of permanent sample silvicultural plots (PSP) in the 
ponderosa pine forests of the Southwest (Pearson 1923, 1933, 1942, Moore et al. 

8 
2004).  On the PSPs that are located on the FVEF, there are a set of nested 
understory subplots, which were established in 1914 to quantify woody and 
herbaceous plant composition, and secondary plant succession.  The nested 
understory plots were 1.5 x 3.0 m and were permanently marked with iron pipes 
(Moore et al. 1999, Bakker et al. 2002).  We have annually remapped 10 1-m2 
quadrats within these original understory plots since 2006 (Laughlin 2009, 
Laughlin et al. 2011, Strahan 2013), and these quadrats are labelled according to 
their FVEF PSP name, such as S1A, S2A, S3A, etc. 
In 1927, the FVEF initiated a study on the Wild Bill range of the 
Coconino National Forest to experimentally isolate the agents responsible for 
injury to ponderosa pine regeneration (Cooperrider 1938, 1939), while 
simultaneously assessing the impacts of livestock grazing on herbaceous 
composition and cover through the establishment of chart quadrats (Laughlin and 
Moore 2008).  Known as the “Cooperrider-Cassidy Range Study”, quadrats were 
installed on the USFS range allotments which covered ~12,000 ha northwest of 
Flagstaff, Arizona, known as the Wild Bill and Willaha (Cooperrider and Cassidy 
1939a, 1939b, Laughlin and Moore 2008).  We have annually remapped these 28 
1-m2 quadrats since 2006 (Laughlin 2009, Laughlin et al. 2011, Strahan 2013, 
Strahan et al. 2015) and these plots are labelled as “Wild Bill” in the database. 
We provide the following data and data formats: (1) high-resolution image 
files (*.tiff); (2) the digitized maps in shapefile format; (3) a tabular 
representation of centroid or point location (x, y coordinates); and basal cover for 
species mapped as polygons; (4) a species list including the total records for each 

9 
species, (5) quadrat inventory of the years each quadrat was sampled; (6) quadrat 
information including GPS coordinates and elevation; and (7) monthly 
precipitation and temperature records.

1. Site description: All permanent quadrats are located within 40 km of Flagstaff, 
AZ, and are distributed over multiple sites spanning 700 km2 of varying soil type, 
topography, and spanning the elevational range of the ponderosa pine-bunchgrass 
ecosystem type of northern Arizona  
a. Site type: N/A 
b. Geography: The study site is located within 700 km2 of Flagstaff, Arizona, on 
the Coconino National Forest and Fort Valley Experimental Forest between the 
elevations of 2,000-2,500 m.  Soil types are derived from basalt, limestone, and 
sandstone parent materials.  
c. Habitat: Arnold (1950), Pearson (1950), Covington and Moore (1994 a and b), 
Bakker (2005), Bakker and Moore (2007), Bakker et al. (2008), Laughlin and 
Moore (2008), Laughlin et al. (2011), and Strahan et al. (2015) describe the 
vegetation at these sites.  The vegetation type is characteristic of the ponderosa 
pine-bunchgrass ecosystem, though the cover of herbaceous vegetation is often 
sparse in areas with high ponderosa pine tree canopy cover.  In these areas, high 
loads of down woody debris (i.e., litter and duff) are interspersed with numerous 
patches of bare ground and exposed rock.  The most conspicuous woody 
components of the vegetation where the quadrats are located are trees, shrubs and 
subshrubs.  Overstory trees are primarily comprised of the two native tree species 
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws. var. scopularum Engelm.) and Gambel 
oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt. Var. bonina S.L. Welsh); and several juniper species 
(Juniperus spp.) are present at the Big Fill site.  There are many native shrub and 

11 
subshrub species that occur in close proximity to these quadrats, the shrubs and 
subshrubs that have been mapped on these quadrats include: three-leaf sumac 
(Rhus trilobata Nutt.), Woods’ rose (Rosa woodsii Lindl. Var. glabrata (Parish) 
Cole), and broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae (DC.) A. Gray).  The 
understory herbaceous plant community is the major source of plant biodiversity 
in these ecosystems and is dominated by perennial bunchgrasses followed by 
perennial forbs and annual and biennial forbs.  In the meadows and forested 
openings are the forbs, grasses and graminoids.  Grasses and graminoids primarily 
include: Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica Vasey), mountain muhly 
(Muhlenbergia montana (Nutt.) A.S. Hitchc.), squirreltail (Elymus elymoides 
(Raf.) Swezey), upland sedge (Carex sp.), muttongrass (Poa fendleriana (Steud.) 
Vasey ssp. albescens (Hitchc.) Soreng), pine dropseed (Blepharoneuron 
tricholepis (Torr.) Nash), black dropseed (Sporobolus interruptus Vasey) 
(endemic to northern Arizona), and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L. ssp. 
alpigena (Fr. ex Blytt) Hiitonen).  The forbs are diverse and less uniform in their 
distribution, several of the most widely abundant forb species include: common 
yarrow (Achillea millefolium L. var. alpicola (Rydb.) Garrett), Carruth’s sagewort 
(Artemisia carruthii Alph. Wood ex Carruth), Kaibab pussytoes (Antennaria 
rosulata Rydb.), fetid goosefoot (Chenopodium graveolens), thymeleaf sandmat 
(Chamaesyce serpyllifolia Pers.), trailing fleabane (Erigeron flagellaris A. Gray), 
spreading fleabane (Erigeron divergens Torr. & A. Gray), and western aster 
(Symphyotrichum ascendens Lindl. G.L. Nesom).

 d. Geology: The study area spans the range of soil types developed from basalt, 
limestone, and sandstone parent materials (Bakker 2005, Laughlin 2009, Strahan 
2013).  
e. Watersheds/hydrology: Throughout the entire study area there is an absence of 
surface water except for the Rogers Lake site which is in close proximity to the 
large natural wetland area known as Rogers Lake, an ephemeral stream that 
occurs in close proximity to the Black Springs site, and a man-made tank in close 
proximity to Reese Tank. 
f. Site history: The 10 quadrats, which are permanent sample plots (PSP) (such as 
S1A, S2A, S3A, etc.), are located either within the Fort Valley Experimental 
Forest (FVEF) in close proximity to Highway 180.  There are no grazing 
enclosures associated with these quadrats.  The 50 quadrats known as the “Hill 
Plots” are distributed at 5 distinct sites each of which contains a grazing 
exclosure: (1) Big Fill is located across from a ranch house on Old Walnut 
Canyon Road (FS road 303) about 3.2 km southeast of junction with Country 
Club Drive, (2) Black Springs is located on Old Mund’s Highway (FS road 762) 
1.2 km southeast of junction with Highway 89A and directly west of Interstate 17; 
(3) Fry Park is located in the northwest corner of Fry Park along FS road 535; (4) 
Reese Tank is bisected by FS road 418 and southwest of Bearjaw Fire on the 
north side of the San Francisco Peaks; and (5) Rogers Lake is located at the 
junction of Woody Mountain Road (FS road 231) and road to Aspen Spring 
Ranch 0.8 km south of Rogers Lake. The 28 quadrats known as the “Wild Bill 
Plots” are dispersed widely throughout the Wild Bill and Willaha grazing 

13 
allotments that are located west and northwest of the San Francisco Peaks and to 
the south or at the base of Kendrick Mountain. 
g. Climate: Mean annual precipitation is 565 mm and mean annual temperature is 
7.7ºC (Kohn and Welker 2005, Strahan 2013). G.A. Pearson (1931) provides a 
thorough description of the climate in northern Arizona, further information 
pertaining to contemporary climate description was through the Western Regional 
Climate Center (WRCC) (http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/ARIZONA.htm), 
through NOAA (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data) 
for the Pullman Airport weather station, and the USFS RMRS FVEF climate data 
catalog (http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/fort-valley/data/).  Annual means in precipitation 
fluctuate more widely than temperature for in northern Arizona.  Daily or monthly 
mean temperature exhibit greater fluctuations than averages are for periods of a 
year or longer.  The daily range between maximum and minimum temperature 
can be as large as 50 to 60 degrees between day time high and night time low, 
however, mean annual temperatures seldom fluctuate more than 10 percent versus 
precipitation averages that often fluctuate as much as 100 percent.  Growing 
season is, on average, less than 3 months but can begin as early as April and 
persist through October (WRCC).  Periodic droughts are common in northern 
Arizona and tend to occur when mean monthly temperature and precipitation are 
at their lowest.  Great yearly and periodic variation in precipitation is 
characteristic of northern Arizona and present throughout our study area, 
precipitation patterns for this region are bimodal and occur in the winter and 
summer months (WRCC).  Precipitation is governed by elevation and season of 

14 
the year.  From November through March, winter storms bring snow which can 
accumulate to depths of 2,540 mm or more (WRCC).  The gradual melting of 
snow during the spring is important source of water to maintain soil moisture, 
especially during the late spring and early summer when rainless periods are 
common.  Summer rainfall occurs in the form of thunderstorms (referred to as the 
summer monsoons) which begin early in July and usually lasts until mid-
September (Pearson 1931). 
2. Experimental or sampling design 
a. Design characteristics:  
1. “Fort Valley Experimental Forest - PSP” are comprised of 10 
permanent chart quadrats, none of which are contained in a grazing 
exclosure. 
2. “Hill Plots” are comprised of 50 permanent chart quadrats distributed at 
5 sites. At each site there are a total of 10 quadrats, five inside a grazing 
exclosure and five outside the grazing exclosure. 
3. “Wild Bill Plots” are comprised of 28 permanent chart quadrats 
dispersed throughout two grazing allotments. (Wild Bill and Willaha). 
b. Permanent plots: See quadrat information data file in IV.  
c. Data collection:  
All quadrats are mapped during the late summer, typically during a 4 week period 
in August.  
1. “FVEF PSP” were mapped in 1914 and again in 1919, and have been remapped 
annually since 2006. 

15 
2. “Hill Plots” were mapped periodically from 1912 until 1948, and have been 
remapped annually since 2002. 
3. Wild Bill plots” Quadrats were mapped annually from 1927 through 1938, and 
have been remapped annually since 2006.  
3. Research Methods 
a. Field / laboratory: Historical data were collected in the field using pantographs  
(Hill 1920), a mechanical device used to make scale drawings.  Contemporary 
data are collected in the field using a PVC chart quadrat that is further subdivided 
into a grid with 25 cells.  Each cell is mapped onto a transparency sheet with a 
grid system that is transcribed onto a paper data sheet.  The original paper maps 
(both historical and contemporary) are first scanned and then stored as TIFF 
image files.  These images are then uploaded as raster images in ArcMap were 
each individual plant is digitized into shapefiles in ArcGIS. For a complete 
digitization protocol, contact Margaret M. Moore.  Monthly climate data was 
obtained from the USFS RMRS FVEF climate data catalog 
(http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/fort-valley/data/) and through NOAA 
(https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data) for the Pullman 
Airport weather station 
b. Instrumentation: Pantographs (historical), paper data sheets (contemporary), 
scanners, and computers running ArcGIS, Python, and R. 
c. Taxonomy and systematics: Originally assigned plant names were corrected for 
synonyms, and historical and contemporary names resolved (Bakker 2005, 

16 
Laughlin 2009).  Current names are based on the USDA Plants Database 
(http://plants.usda.gov/). 
d. Permit history: Permits were obtained through the Coconino National Forest 
and the Fort Valley Experimental Forest. 
e. Legal / organizational requirements: None. 
CLASS III. DATA SET STATUS AND ACCESSIBILITY 
A. Status 
1. Latest Update: December 2014. 
2. Latest Archive date: December 2014. 
3. Metadata status: The metadata are complete and up to date. 
4. Data verification: All maps are checked for completeness and accuracy initially 
after all individuals have been digitized again prior to spatial adjustment.  Helen 
E. Dowling made the following changes to the original (digitized) GIS dataset 
(stored shapefiles) between 2013 and 2014: (1) Shapefiles were rotated to have a 
consistent North-South vertical orientation; (2) Species names for large unlabeled 
or obviously mislabeled polygons were assigned based on species names assigned 
to the same features in previous or later years; (3) Shapefiles were processed 
using R and Python scripts to cut polygons and point features at the map borders 
and remove any small polygon “slivers” generated accidentally while digitizing; 
(4) Other miscellaneous corrections based on visual inspection of the shapefiles; 
(5) All species were then classified as either density- or cover-type features.  All 
grasses and graminoids are digitized as polygon features.  All woody (tree and 
shrub) and forbs, with the exception of three species, are digitized as point 

17 
features; (6) Plant names were corrected for synonyms based on the USDA 
PLANTS Database (http://plants.usda.gov/).  Some questionable, infrequent taxa 
lumped into "sp." categories; and (7) x, y coordinates of each polygon centroid 
were added to shapefile attribute tables.  
B. Accessibility 
1. Storage location and medium: The data are available from the Ecological  
Society of America’s data archives.  Duplicate copies of the data are being stored

CHAPTER 3:  
ELECTRONIC FIELD CAPTURE METHOD MORE EFFICIENT THAN 
TRADITIONAL METHOD  
FOR ANNUAL CENSUS OF HERBACEOUS PLANTS 
Abstract 
We developed an electronic field data collection method (electronic 
method) to remap the herbaceous vegetation on a set of 1-m2 quadrats in the 
ponderosa pine-bunchgrass ecosystem in northern Arizona.  The method uses 
ESRI ArcMap to collect plant data on field computers, which: (1) creates a digital 
data capture system; (2) allows the ability to search and manipulate the data from 
current and previous years; (3) allows a visual display of the previous year’s data 
map while in the field; (4) reduces the likelihood of data collection errors; and (5) 
removes the need to digitize maps from paper copies.  We tested the electronic 
data collection method against the traditional paper mapping method to assess the 
efficacy of these two methods.  The electronic method increased the amount of 
field time necessary to map the vegetation on each quadrat, yet the amount of 
office time needed to process each quadrat was significantly diminished.  In total 
(i.e., considering both field and office time), the electronic method eliminated an 
average of 26:49 (mm:ss) per quadrat.  Implementing the electronic method can 
reduce the amount of time and resources needed to annually census the vegetation 
on permanent chart quadrats.

Introduction 
The use of electronic field data capture methods in ecology has increased 
over the past few decades as technological advances allow new approaches to 
streamline data collection, processing, and dissemination efforts.  Traditional 
paper-based field data collection procedures are both time and labor intensive.  
Limited funding available for field data collection has created an urgent need to 
streamline and develop more consistent methods using new GIS applications that 
will decrease the amount of time and labor necessary to complete field data 
collection for chart quadrat studies.  
Computers are widely used in all aspects of ecological research but their 
application to in-field data collection for herbaceous understory vegetation has 
rarely been evaluated (Inman-Narahari et al. 2010).  Previous studies have 
revealed other benefits associated with the development of new methods of 
digitizing data in the field. For example Buller and colleagues (2004) concluded 
that evolving from paper field notes to electronic field capture (field digitizing) 
has been shown to: (1) reduce the likelihood of transposition or scientific errors 
entering the data collection process; (2) increase our ability to search and 
manipulate the field data; (3) improve quality assurance and quality control from 
the inception of data collection; and (4) decrease the amount of time and labor 
needed to complete annual field data collection. 
The primary purpose of this experiment was to assess the efficiency of the 
traditional paper-based method and the electronic field capture of data collection 
for fine-scaled herbaceous chart quadrats.  To address this question, we developed 

32 
an electronic method using ArcGIS 10.2.2 that facilitates the electronic field 
capture of chart quadrat data with the use of a field computer (Panasonic 
Toughbook CF-191DYCX1M).   
Methods 
Study Area and Data Set 
The study area, known as the Black Springs study site, is located 9.7 km 
south of Flagstaff, AZ in the ponderosa pine-bunchgrass ecosystem.  This study 
site is part of the larger “Hill Plot” study (see Chapter 2, this thesis, Bakker and 
Moore 2007, Bakker et al. 2008, Laughlin et al. 2011, Strahan et al. 2015).  The 
chart quadrats at this site were originally established in 1912 by R.R. Hill (Hill 
1917, Talbot and Hill 1923).  Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson 
var. scopulorum Englem.) is the only tree species present.  The understory 
herbaceous vegetation is dominated by perennial grasses such as black dropseed 
(Sporobolus interruptus Vasey), muttongrass (Poa fendleriana (Steud.) Vasey), 
Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica Vasey), and mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia 
montana (Nutt.) A.S. Hitchc.), along with a variety of forbs. 
The Black Springs site contains 14 permanently marked 1-m2 chart 
quadrats.  The precise locations of corners and boundaries of chart quadrats are 
permanently marked (tagged angle iron or galvanized steel pipe corners) in the 
field.  All herbaceous perennial vegetation in these quadrats are mapped and 
digitized into ArcMap (Figure 3.1).  
We randomly selected a subset of 10 chart quadrats from the 14 quadrats 
at Black Springs.  We mapped the perennial herbaceous vegetation (graminoids 

33 
and forbs) on the 10 quadrats using two methods, the traditional paper-based 
method (which has been used since 1912) and the newly developed electronic 
field data capture method.  We used a stopwatch to time each step of each method 
both in the field and in the office.  We recorded these times to assess the tradeoffs 
in time between the traditional paper-based and electronic data capture methods.   
To randomize these data, we used a coin toss to determine which 
researcher would collect and which researcher would enter the data for each 
quadrat for each method. Figure 3.2 contains a work flow diagram illustrating the 
similarities and differences between the traditional paper-based method and the 
electronic data capture method. Data collection steps were completed in the field 
for both methods and were categorized under the “field time” for each method. 
Data entry steps were steps completed in the office for each method, and were 
categorized as “office time” in the analysis. There is a difference in the number of 
steps between the two methods due to: (1) the lack of the transcription step in the 
electronic data capture method; and (2) the additional scanning of paper data 
sheets to load as raster images in the traditional paper-based method.  
Office Preparation 
Prior to going into the field, for the traditional paper-based method, we 
prepared a field binder that included: a site map for Black Springs, the most 
recent data sheet for each selected chart quadrat, and 10 blank paper data sheets.  
For the electronic field data capture method, we created point and polygon 
shapefiles for each quadrat and modified their attribute tables using the Visual 
Basic for Applications (VBA)/Macros function in ArcMap.  We saved these pre-

34 
made shapefiles into each quadrat subfolder with the corresponding Plot-specific 
Grid Template.  We saved all subfolders into a site folder with site name and year 
in the title (i.e., BlackSprings_2014_IC), where IC indicates that data entry is 
incomplete.  We saved the site folder onto the office computer, the field 
computer, and two separate USB drives so minimize the potential for lost data. 
Chart Quadrat Method 
Figure 3.2 contains a work flow diagram that illustrates the similarities 
and differences between the traditional paper-based method and the electronic 
field capture method of mapping chart quadrats.  Both methods require that a 1-
m2 PVC sampling frame is overlain on top of the 1-m2 chart quadrat in the field 
by orienting the frame precisely with the angle iron and rebar that permanently 
mark the corners of each quadrat. To do this consistently from year-to-year, 
symbols are included on each year’s data sheet to illustrate the exact location of 
the rebar and angle iron in respect to the specific quadrat. Each year, the field 
crew orients the PVC frame using these angle iron/rebar symbols from previous 
year’s data sheet for reference and the spatial location of the perennial plants 
within the quadrat. 
The sampling frame is further divided into a grid of 25 cells (Fig. 3.3 
right), each cell consisting of a smaller fine-grained grid. We printed 25 cells, 
each containing a fine-grain grid (Fig. 3.3, bolded), to allow the mapper to map 
each cell separately onto the corresponding grid transparency. This enabled the 
transcriber (traditional paper-based method) or digitizer (electronic data capture 
method) to map each individual to scale for each cell within the 1-m2 chart 

35 
quadrat using the grid system.  We mapped each chart quadrat using both 
methods.  Again, a coin toss was used to determine which researcher would 
transcribe the data with each method.  
The following descriptions highlight the differences between the two 
methods.  The traditional paper-based method requires transcribing the 25 cells to 
scale on a paper data sheet using the fine-grained grid system to map each 
individual to scale based on its specific location within the quadrat (Fig. 3.3).  
These paper data sheets are then scanned and uploaded as raster images 
(resolution 1:4.214) in ArcMap so that each plant can be digitized as point or 
polygon features.  The electronic field capture method eliminates the transcription 
step and allows the user to digitize the quadrat map directly from the 25 cells 
using the grid template to map each individual to scale, directly in the field. 
For both methods, once each quadrat map is digitized, the corners of the 
square grid are spatially adjusted to a reference boundary that corresponds to one 
square unit of geospace.  After the quadrat map has been spatially adjusted, the 
field calculator can be used to calculate the field geometry of each feature 
(individual plant) to determine the centroid or point location (x, y coordinates) and 
basal cover for species mapped as polygons.  Since the units in the field calculator 
correspond to one square unit of geospace, and the chart quadrat is 1-m2, the area 
values for each polygon feature are given in cm2.  
To facilitate electronic field capture, we developed a Grid Template using 
ArcMap 10.2.2 that replicated the square grid component of the paper data sheet 
that corresponds to the 1-m2 chart quadrats.  Initially, we tried to create the Grid 

36 
Template by replicating a grid from a raster image of a paper data sheet.  Using 
the zoom function in ArcMap, we found that the cells on the paper data sheet 
were not of uniform size.  Instead, we designed the grid template in ArcMap that 
consisted of uniform cells, which increased the spatial accuracy of each mapped 
individual by eliminating fine-scale discrepancies between cells.   
To ensure that each quadrat is aligned correctly in the field, we included 
symbols at each corner of the grid to indicate the exact location of rebar and angle 
iron in respect to the quadrat.  Once these plot-specific symbols were included in 
the Grid Template, we exported the Plot-Specific Grid Template as a TIFF file 
and saved it into the corresponding plot subfolder.  We developed a Plot-Specific 
Information Template that included the component of the paper data sheet that 
contains a table for species mapped, percent cover estimates per species, and 
additional notes.  We developed a Species List Template in Excel that consisted 
of a comprehensive list of the scientific names of all species recorded within the 
Black Springs study area.  
Field Data Collection 
In the field, for the traditional paper-based method, we transcribed each 
cell onto the paper data sheets with a mechanical pencil and used a metal tatum to 
prevent damage to the paper data sheets in the field.  To maintain consistency 
with how the traditional method is employed during a normal field season, we 
began with the first cell in the first column (Fig. 3.3) and transcribed the entire 
column before moving on to the second column and so on until the final cell in 
the final column was completed.  We drew in dots and angle symbols in reference 

37 
to the corners of the square grid component of the data sheet to illustrate the plot-
specific location of the angle iron and rebar with respect to each chart quadrat.  
These symbols ensure that the quadrat is properly aligned in the field.  We listed 
all plant species in the species table and included the species symbols and percent 
cover estimates for each species.  
In the field, for the electronic field data capture method, we used the 
construction tools in the editor function of ArcMap 10.2.2 to digitized perennial 
graminoid and several forb species as polygon features and the majority of forb 
species as point features.  To increase efficiency, we digitized all individuals of 
the same species at the same time to enable us to copy and paste the species 
scientific names from the Species List Template into the attribute table using the 
field calculator.  This reduces the potential for spelling errors and also saves time 
in the field.  Once all species had been digitized, we saved our edits and exited 
ArcMap.  We used the Plot-Specific Information Template to list all species in the 
species table and include percent cover estimates for each species.  We saved the 
completed templates and shapefiles into the corresponding plot subfolders and 
transferred them into the site folder titled Black Springs_2014_C, where C 
indicates that data entry is complete.  To minimize the risk of lost data, we saved 
the completed site folder onto the field computer and each USB drive in the field 
and transferred completed files to the office computer at the end of each field day. 
Office Data Entry 
For the traditional paper-based method, for steps that would typically be 
completed for several quadrats at one time (i.e., scanning data sheets into database 

38 
and making a folder connection in ArcCatalog), we recorded the amount of time 
needed to complete the step for all 10 quadrats and then divided the total time by 
10 to get the average amount of time per quadrat.  Once the scanned data were 
accessed through ArcCatalog, we pulled the raster image of the paper data sheet 
into ArcMap.  We created point and polygon shapefiles for each quadrat and 
modified their attribute tables using the VBA/Macros function in ArcMap.  We 
used the construction tools in the editor function to digitize the perennial 
graminoid and several forb species as polygon features and the remaining forb 
species as point features.  Using the “new displacement link” tool in the editor of 
ArcMap, we spatially adjusted all features to the reference boundary.  We 
calculated the field geometry and saved these edits to complete the data entry 
process.  
For the electronic data capture method, for steps that would typically be 
completed for several quadrats at one time (i.e., transferring files from laptop to 
office computer and creating a folder connection in ArcCatalog), we recorded the 
amount of time needed to complete the step for all 10 quadrats and then divided 
the total time by 10 to get the average amount of time per quadrat.  Once we 
accessed the files through ArcCatalog, we pulled the edited point and polygon 
shapefiles and the Plot-Specific Grid Template for each plot in to ArcMap.  Using 
the “new displacement link” tool in the editor of ArcMap, we spatially adjusted 
all features to a reference boundary.  We calculated the field geometry and saved 
these edits to complete the data entry process for the electronic data capture 
method.  

39 
Statistical Analysis 
We obtained sums, means, and standard deviations for the field, office, 
and total time for the traditional paper-based and electronic data capture methods.  
Since the data used in this analysis were the times recorded for each step of each 
method, and each method varied in the number of steps required for the “field”, 
“office”, and “total”, then there was an unequal number of observations and an 
unequal variance between the sample sizes used for each method. To account for 
this difference in sample size and variance, we compared means and standard 
deviations between methods using a two-sample unequal variance heteroscedastic 
Student’s T-test (Ott and Longnecker 2008).  We tested for linear correlation 
between percent cover and the amount of time required to map each quadrat using 
a Pearson correlation coefficient (Ott and Longnecker 2008).  
Results 
All units from the following analyses are reported in time (h:mm:ss). 
Means, standard deviations, and p-values are reported in Figure 3.4 and Table 3.1.  
The average total time (n=10) for the traditional paper-based method was 1:33:37 
with a standard deviation of 0:41:53, while the electronic field data capture 
method was 1:06:48 with a standard deviation of 0:24:09.  The average field time 
for the traditional paper-based method was 0:39:39 with a standard deviation of 
0:14:12, while the electronic field data capture method was nearly doubled at 
1:03:20 with a standard deviation of 0:23:31.  The average office time for the 
traditional paper-based method was 0:53:58 with a standard deviation of 0:27:40, 

40 
while the electronic field data capture method was reduced to 0:03:27 with a 
standard deviation of 0:00:38. 
Of the 10 quadrats sampled, one quadrat (Q91) was nearly devoid of 
vegetation (>0.5% cover), while the other quadrats contained between 8-30% 
cover.  We found a correlation between the percent cover and amount of time 
required to map each quadrat for both the traditional paper-based method and the 
electronic field capture method.  The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.935 
and 0.895 for the traditional paper-based and electronic field capture methods, 
respectively.  
This large difference in herbaceous cover values led to a large standard 
deviation for the average field time for both methods; however, since the 
electronic field capture method requires more field time this translated into a 
proportionately larger standard deviation.  Further analysis concluded that Q91 
was not a significant outlier (Grubbs’ test; Grubbs 1950, Ott and Longnecker 
2008).  However, since our purpose was to determine how long it took to map 
quadrats with vegetation, we conducted the analysis again without Q91 to see 
whether or not this relatively bare plot had a significant influence on the p-values 
for the average field, office, and total times.  The overall trend did not change 
when Q91 was excluded (i.e., field time increased, office time diminished, total 
time decreased for the electronic data capture method), however, excluding Q91 
did alter the p-values, resulting in a higher level of significance in these findings 
(Table 3.1 and Figure 3.5). 
 

41 
Discussion and Conclusions 
Our results suggest that there are qualitative trade-offs that exist between 
the traditional paper-based and electronic field data capture methods.  The 
electronic field data capture method increases field time and accuracy while it 
diminishes the office time significantly and eliminates the transcription process by 
allowing the user to digitize each quadrat in the field.  These crucial differences 
result in an overall decrease in total time per quadrat for the electronic field data 
capture method.  
For quadrats that are bare or nearly bare, there is no difference in 
efficiency between methods, as revealed by Q91. The absence, or near absence, of 
individual plants to map allows for the rapid digitizing of these quadrats 
regardless of which method is employed.  For quadrats that are not bare and have 
plants to map, the electronic field data capture method decreases the overall 
amount of time per quadrat on average by almost 0.5 hours, for an average 
decrease of approximately 44 hours per field season for the 98 chart quadrats used 
in the larger study (see Chapter 2 of this thesis).  Decreasing the amount of money 
and time spent on data collection and entry allows researchers to allocate those 
funds elsewhere in the project budget. 
Considering the amount of money and time invested in data collection and 
entry, and how data quality can affect the analysis and conclusions of a study, it is 
worthwhile to explore options that may increase efficiency and accuracy (Inman-
Narahari et al. 2010).  Limited funding available for field data collection and 

42 
entry has created an urgent need to develop new GIS applications that will 
decrease the amount of time and labor necessary to complete field data collection.  
Developing new methods of digitizing data in the field will improve 
quality assurance and quality control from the inception of data collection while 
decreasing the amount of time and labor needed to complete annual field data 
collection (Buller 2004).  By quantifying this increase in efficiency and data 
accuracy, we aim to provide evidence that digital collection methods for mapping 
chart quadrats in fine-scale permanent plots can improve herbaceous vegetation 
monitoring and long-term ecological studies. 
Electronic data collection has been proven to enhance ecological research 
capacity, yet researchers remain reluctant to adopt digital methods for the 
following reasons: concern of losing large amounts of data, initial investment 
required to purchase and implement new system, the weather-resistance of 
electronic devices, and lack of familiarity with digital options (Inman-Narahari et 
al. 2010).  Past attempts to develop electronic field capture methods have been 
developed; however, technological and computational limitations impeded the 
widespread use of these methods (Mack and Pyke 1979, Roskier et al. 1997).   
While these concerns do hold merit, digital technology has improved 
greatly in recent years to become more secure, rugged, economical, and user 
friendly (Inman-Narahari et al. 2010).  The field computers used in this study are 
completely water-resistant and shock-resistant, with data entry by keyboard or 
touchscreen, and digitizing by mouse or stylus (digital pen).  The stylus allows the 
user to draw polygons or polylines into ArcMap as they would on a traditional 

43 
paper datasheet, thus increasing the usability of the digital method (Clegg et al. 
2006).  Finally, implementing protocols described in this study that require 
frequent saving on both laptop and portable USB drive reduces the risk of losing 
large amounts of data.  
Recent studies have quantified the increase in efficiency resulting from the 
use of digital collection methods for mapping and measuring trees in large-scale 
permanent forest dynamic plots (Inman-Narahari et al. 2010).  With this case 
study, we have quantified a similar increase in efficiency resulting from the use of 
digital collection methods for mapping the vegetation in fine-scale 1-m2 
permanent chart quadrats.  Case studies such as these document the increase in 
efficiency that results from the use of digital data collection methods, which is 
applicable to any ecological study that requires the mapping of vegetation based 
spatial location within a circumscribed area through the use of a grid system, 
regardless of the scale of plot.   
The key here is to spatially adjust the grid to a reference boundary that can 
translate easily to units of measure applicable to the specific study (i.e., 1-m2 
quadrats, this study, or 20-m2 quadrats for the Inman-Narahari et al. 2010 study).   
The drawback to electronic data collection is the initial investment of the 
field computer with enough processing power to run ArcGIS 10.2.2 and memory 
to back-up all field files.  Initially, we designed this study to collect these data 
using ArcPad on a tablet.  However, we found that the lower processing power 
built into most tablets limited the performance of ArcPad in practice causing the 
application to be highly unstable.  As technology advances, tablets will likely be 

44 
designed with higher levels of processing power, enabling the electronic field data 
capture method to run smoothly both in ArcMap and ArcPad. 
Employing the electronic field data capture method to digitize herbaceous 
vegetation on permanent chart quadrats will increase the time spent in the field; 
however, this approach will almost eliminate the time needed to enter data back in 
the office.  Transitioning to the electronic field data capture method of mapping 
chart quadrats will decrease the amount labor needed to collect and digitize data, 
reduce the likelihood that transposition or scientific errors will occur during data 
collection, and increase our ability to search and manipulate the field data (Buller 
2004).  By implementing the electronic field data capture method of mapping 
chart quadrats, we can streamline the field data collection, while improving 
quality assurance and quality control.

CHAPTER 4: 
DIRECT EFFECTS OF SEASONAL PRECIPITATION ON THE 
DEMOGRAPHY OF ARIZONA FESCUE 
Abstract 
We used detailed local climate variables and data from an annually 
remapped dataset (2002-2014) described in Chapter 2 to examine the effects of 
seasonal precipitation on the key demographic rates of Arizona fescue (Festuca 
arizonica Vasey).  We reconstructed life tables to examine the vital rates (e.g., 
survival probabilities, growth, and life expectancies) of Arizona fescue.  We made 
population projections using the species’ state (size) and precipitation variables 
using Integral Projection Models (IPMs) to quantify the direct influence of 
seasonal precipitation on the vital rates of this species.  We pooled the 
demographic data for all 13 years, with the corresponding seasonal precipitation 
covariates from that year, into one data frame to estimate the survival/growth 
kernel of the IPM.  We confirmed the notion that growth was dependent upon 
spring precipitation and survival was dependent upon winter precipitation for 
Arizona fescue.  We estimated the population growth rate and predicted a stable 
size distribution from the discretized survival/growth kernel.  Incorporating 
information derived from data-driven models into adaptive management strategies 
enables land managers to predict shifts in plant populations and community 
composition, forage production, and ecosystem function.

48 
Introduction 
In an era characterized by anthropogenic climate and land-use change, 
understanding the impact of these changes on plant populations and community 
dynamics has taken on a new level of urgency (Dalgleish et al. 2010, Adler et al. 
2012, Chu et al. 2013).  Our ability to predict vegetation dynamics is restricted by 
our current lack of understanding of how plant populations are influenced by 
climate change because climatic variation is the primary driver of interannual 
variation in population growth rates in many ecosystems (Laurenroth and Adler 
2008, Dalgliesh et al. 2011, Adler et al. 2012, Adler et al. 2013, Chu et al. 2014).  
Current theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that climate variation 
may increase the variability of demographic rates for many species, potentially 
altering demographics at the community level (Dalgleish et al. 2010).  One 
valuable approach to predicting population responses to climate change is to 
describe the relationships between climate variables and demographic rates that 
emerge from the synthesis of long-term observational data (Adler et al. 2013).  
We used detailed local climate variables and a dataset from the annually 
remapped (2002-2014) chart quadrats described in Chapter 2 to examine the 
effects of climate on the demographic rates of a dominant, cool-season, 
bunchgrass species, Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica Vasey).  
In the semi-arid ecosystems of the Southwest, the cover of perennial 
bunchgrasses can vary greatly from year to year, challenging land managers to 
adopt new strategies for gauging forage production (Dalgleish et al. 2011).  Since 
Euro-American settlement, fire suppression and livestock grazing practices have 

49 
induced a significant shift in the structure of southwestern ponderosa pine 
dominated forests, profoundly impacting the herbaceous understory in these 
frequent-fire ecosystems (Covington and Moore 1994a and b).  For these 
perennial bunchgrass species, the importance of growth, survival and recruitment 
varies significantly with genet size, which exhibits a great amount of interannual 
variation (Laurenroth and Adler 2008, Dalgleish et al. 2011, Chu et al. 2014).  
The factors that affect genet size have the potential of creating feedbacks 
between the size distribution of genets, the population growth rates, and the 
availability of forage (Dalgleish et al 2011).  Altered population growth of a 
dominant species could have profound effects on community structure and 
ecosystem function (Dalgleish et al. 2011). Therefore, the size structure of 
dominant bunchgrass populations can be altered greatly by changes in climate or 
land-use practices, potentially altering plant population structure, community 
dynamics, and ecosystem function. 
To examine the size structure of this Arizona fescue population, we first 
reconstructed life tables to examine vital rates (e.g., survival probabilities, growth, 
and life expectancies) from long-term observational data derived from the core 
data set described in Chapter 2.  We then made population projections using the 
species’ state (size) and precipitation variables using Integral Projection Models 
(IPMs) to quantify the direct influence of seasonal precipitation on the vital rates 
of this perennial bunchgrass. 
We predicted that survival and growth for this cool-season (C3 
photosynthetic pathway) perennial bunchgrass to be dependent upon winter and 

50 
spring precipitation based on previous descriptions of the phenology for Arizona 
fescue (Pearson 1942, Pearson 1967, Clary 1975).  Incorporating information 
derived from data-driven models into adaptive management strategies enables 
land managers to predict shifts in plant populations and community composition, 
forage production, and ecosystem function.  Through science-based approaches to 
predicting shifts in plant populations, which are the result of anthropogenic 
climate and land-use change, we can attempt to mitigate the impacts of climate 
change and adapt our land-use practices to restore and conserve native plant 
populations and communities.  Gaining a better understanding of the climatic 
factors that drive plant population demography will allow land managers to make 
informed decisions regarding land-use practices and the implementation of 
restoration treatments in the Southwest. 
Methods 
Study Area and Data Description 
The demographic data used in this study were derived from a set of 98 
permanent chart quadrats established between 1912 and 1927 to examine: 1) the 
effects of grazing on the herbaceous plant community, 2) grass competition with 
pine seedling establishment, and 3) initial patterns of plant succession (see 
Chapter 2, this thesis, Talbot and Hill 1923, Pearson 1923, 1933, 1942; Arnold 
1950).  Spanning the elevational range of ponderosa pine (2,000-2,500 m), all 
quadrats are found on soil types derived from basalt, limestone, and sandstone 
parent materials and are located within 40 km of Flagstaff, Arizona on the 
Coconino National Forest and the Fort Valley Experimental Forest.  

51 
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws. var. scopularum Englem.) and 
Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt. Var. bonina S.L. Welsh) dominate the 
overstory vegetation, while greater diversity exists in the understory shrub and 
herbaceous plant communities.  Arizona fescue is the focal species in this study, 
which is a widely abundant perennial, cool-season (C3 photosynthetic pathway), 
bunchgrass species that is present throughout our study area.  Refer to Chapter 2 
for a detailed description and history of the study area and data.  
We used detailed climate records to calculate mean monthly precipitation 
and temperature from the nearby Pullman Airport weather station where daily and 
monthly observations are recorded.  The mean annual precipitation from 2002-
2013 was 491 mm and the mean annual temperature was 6.6º C, typical of the 
semi-arid ecosystems of the Southwest. 
Extracting Demographic Data 
Demographic information is rare for herbaceous plants, however, the fine-
scale spatial resolution of chart quadrat maps enables us to track the fate of each 
individual plant over time and analyze spatial patterns over time (Clements 1905, 
Laurenroth and Adler 2008, Zachmann 2010).  Original chart quadrat maps were 
digitized and spatially referenced in a geographic information system (ArcGIS 
10.2.2) allowing for the calculation of demographic parameters (survivorship and 
life expectancy at age 1) (Laurenroth and Adler 2008, Strahan 2013).  
Survivorship (year 1 survival) is an estimate of the probability of an individual 
surviving from year 1 to year 2 (Laurenroth and Adler 2008).  Life expectancy is 

52 
a measure of the average number of years an individual is expected to live once it 
has reached age 1 (Laurenroth and Adler 2008, Strahan 2013). 
We determined demographic parameters for Arizona fescue using 
computer programs developed by Dr. Peter B. Adler (Utah State University) that 
build life tables through the use of two basic rules that classify genets based on 
their spatial location within the quadrat (Fair et al. 1999, Laurenroth and Adler 
2008).  These scripts determine whether an individual is deemed a survivor or a 
new recruit based on its spatial location in reference to conspecific individuals 
within the quadrat by applying a 5 cm buffer designed to account for both mapper 
error and the potential for vegetative growth (Fair et al. 1999, Laurenroth and 
Adler 2008).  
Perennial grass species are mapped as polygon features wherein the 
tracking rules are based on areas of overlapping polygons.  At time t – 1, a 5 cm 
buffer is added to all polygons of a given species.  If an individual overlaps with 
any conspecific polygon in year t it is given the identity of the individual with 
which it shares the greatest overlap, otherwise it is labeled a new recruit 
(Laurenroth and Adler 2008).  This perennial graminoid is known to exhibit 
clonal growth, and these assumptions and tracking rules are designed to account 
for the coalescing and fragmenting of individual plants over time. 
Incorporating Climate Variables 
Using detailed climate records from the nearby Pullman Airport weather 
station, we obtained mean monthly precipitation from 2002-2013.  To represent 
seasonal precipitation, we binned the climate data into three distinct periods of the 

53 
year that represent winter, spring, and summer monsoonal precipitation northern 
Arizona (Table 4.1).  The mean monthly precipitation was averaged over the 
corresponding months to obtain a mean seasonal precipitation value for each 
covariate.  The covariates were inputted into the data frame for size at t and size at 
t + 1 using the covariate and covariateNext function of IPMpack (Metcalf et al. 
2013).  We followed the same assumptions as Dalgleish and others (2011) which 
assume that kernels and climate variables at time t + 1 are independent of time t, 
consistent with the absence of autocorrelation in the climate record.  
Stage-Based Models 
Stage-based models are based on the theory that organisms move through 
life in a pattern of distinct stages over time and that these stages can be described 
based on their distinguishing characteristics (Caswell 2001, Silvertown and 
Charlesworth 2001). If the vital rates of a population depend on size and if growth 
is sufficiently plastic, then the demography of the population is dependent on size 
more than the developmental stage because it is possible for individuals within the 
multi-stage process to revert to earlier stages or skip some stages entirely 
(Caswell 2001). This is the case for perennial graminoids, because the size of an 
individual can change drastically at any stage of life (Silvertown and 
Charlesworth 2001). For size-structured populations such as these, that exhibit 
size-dependent demography, stage must be represented as a continuous variable 
(Caswell 2001).  
Integral projection models (IPMs) are commonly used to examine the how 
changes in individual animal or plant performance influence population dynamics 

54 
for continuously structured populations where some continuous measure of 
individual state (i.e., size) influences growth, survival, or reproduction (Rees et al. 
2014).  Since size and growth of Arizona fescue is known to rapidly change at any 
stage of life, we suspect this to be a size-structured population. Therefore, an 
Integral Projection Model is the best tool to examine population dynamics 
because it is designed to incorporate the individual’s state as a continuous stage 
variable (Metcalf et al. 2013, Merow et al. 2014, Rees et al. 2014). 
Constructing Integral Projection Models 
Differentiated from matrix projection models, which project discrete 
population structure in discrete time, IPMs are constructed from regression 
models predicting vital rates from continuous state variables (e.g., size or age) and 
covariates (e.g., climate, soils, etc.) that provide mechanistic insight into emergent 
ecological patterns (Merow et al. 2014).  Here we used IPMpack, an R package 
designed to incorporate a wide variety of life histories, including both continuous 
and discrete life stages, as well as dependence in vital rates on covariates (Metcalf 
et al. 2013).  
For populations structured by a single continuous variable such as size, the 
state of the population is described by the probability density function n(x, t). This 
defines the proportion of individuals of size x at time t. the integral projection 
model for the number of individual’s size y at time t + 1 is given by

55 
where the kernel K(y,x) represented a matrix of all possible transitions from size x 
to size y. The integration is carried out over all possible sizes bound by L and U, 
the respective lower and upper limits (Metcalf et al. 2013). 
The kernel K can be broken down into two vital rate functions, P(y,x) and 
F(y,x), where P(y,x) represents a matrix of transitions attributable to survival and 
growth (i.e., a survival/growth kernel or Pmatrix) transitions, and the F(y,x) 
describes per-capita contributions of reproductive individuals (Metcalf et al. 
2013).  We did not have fecundity data (e.g., seed stalks, flowering, seeds, etc.) 
for Arizona fescue, therefore our dataset does not include data pertaining to 
fecundity or sexual reproduction (i.e., Fmatrix).  Furthermore, in order to conduct 
sensitivity and elasticity analyses, both the Pmatrix and the Fmatrix must be 
incorporated into the K kernel, so we could not provide sensitivity or elasticity 
analyses. 
We use the probability densities of growth between continuous stages (i.e., 
size) conditional on survival in combination with climate variables modeled in 
discrete time steps to construct a survival/growth kernel (Pmatrix) that allows us 
to examine the direct effect of seasonal precipitation on growth and survival 
(Merow et al. 2014).   
We formatted the data according to the requirements of IPMpack, and 
entered as a data-frame object (a table of rows and columns) (Table 4.2), wherein 
each row represents an individual at time t and time t +1.  We pooled the 
demographic data for all 13 years, with the corresponding covariates from that 
year, into one data frame to estimate the survival/growth kernel of the IPM 

56 
(Easterling 2000).  This allowed us to examine the effect of precipitation on the 
growth and survival for this dominant graminoid from 2002-2013, however, it 
should be noted that the sample size reported in the IPM section of the results is 
inflated because each individual is counted as one sample for each year that it was 
censured.  The true population size is listed in the life tables found in Table 4.4, 
which display the demographic data from 2002-2014 derived from the scripts 
(Laurenroth and Adler 2008). 
Statistical Analysis 
To quantify the relationships that survival and size at time t +1 have with 
size, we build survival and growth objects using the IPMpack functions 
makeSurvObj and makeGrowthObj which specify the desired combination of 
covariates related to size used in predicting vital rates.  For survival and growth 
objects, appropriate methods are defined that implement the model by applying 
the midpoint rule to obtain the P component of the IPM (i.e., Pmatrix) using a 
range of mesh sizes (i.e., the division of size range into artificial size classes of 
equal width) to ensure accurate estimates of population dynamics (Ellner and 
Rees 2006, Dalgleish et al. 2011, Metcalf et al. 2013, Rees et al. 2014).  Once the 
Pmatrix was obtained, we checked the validity of the final IPM using the 
diagnosticsPmatrix function in IPMpack.  
The advantage of IPMpack is that this R package contains a huge array of 
statistical models reflecting the diversity of functional forms as well as error 
structures and transforms of response variables written in object-oriented code 
(Metcalf et al. 2013).  Survival and growth classes are defined within IPMpack 

57 
using features of R that contain linear models relating transforms of size and 
covariates to the vital rate of interest.  The model section process follows the 
same general approach to selecting functional forms for components of a kernel 
for any IPM as outlined by Easterling (2000).  In this general approach, the fitted 
linear model was tested against nonlinear alternatives and the significance of 
nonlinear terms was tested using the ANOVA function with X2 test statistic (Clark 
et al. 1992).   
The survival and growth function p(x,y) was divided into two separate 
survival and growth components in the following equation: 
p(x,y) = s(x)g(x,y)  
where s(x) is the survival probability of a size-x individual, and g(x,y) is the 
probability of a size-x individual growing to be size y (Ferrer-Caevantes et al. 
2012). The survival probability s(x) was modeled as a logistic regression: 
logit[s(x,θ)] = β0 + βsx + βc,1θ1 +…+ βc,iθi + ε 
where x is the log of genet basal area,  β0 is an intercept parameter βs is a slope 
parameter for size, θ is a vector of climate variables for i number of variables, βc,I 
is a slope parameter for the jth effect of climate, and ε is the error term (Dalgleish 
et al. 2011).  Genet growth g(x,y) was estimated through linear regression: 
µg(x,θ) = β0 + βsx + βc,1θ1 +…+ βc,iθi + ε 
where µg(x,θ) is the predicted size at time t + 1, and β0, βs, θ, βc,j , and ε are as 
described above (Dalgleish et al. 2011, Ferrer-Caervantes et al. 2012). Summaries 
of the AIC and p-values for each model compared for Arizona fescue can be 
found in Table 4.3 in the Appendix.  

58 
To construct the survival/growth kernel K from the Pmatrix, survival and 
growth functions underlying the Pmatrix are obtained from statistical models of 
the data.  A key element of construction of an IPM is appropriate statistical model 
selection and expression of conditionalities in the vital rate models that underlie 
the IPM and are obtained by regressing survival and growth on the relevant state 
variable (i.e., size at time t) (Metcalf et al. 2013).  IPMpack has a range of model 
comparison functions that can fit any number of models for survival and growth 
functions and plot the results on a single figure (Metcalf et al. 2013). 
The ‘pair-wise’ model selection process is a reiterative process testing 
multiple models, all of which test the significance of the continuous variable size 
and precipitation covariates on survival and growth.  Once determined, the ‘best 
fit’ model (i.e., lowest AIC) for survival and growth is then implemented by 
applying the midpoint rule for numerical integration to obtain a high-dimensional 
matrix (Metcalf et al. 2013).  The continuous projection kernel is a nonnegative 
surface representing all possible transitions from size x to size y, where the 
population size distribution is described by a density function, and the vital rates 
are a function of genet size (x) and vector of time-varying climate variables 
(Easterling 2000, Dalgleish et al. 2011, Dahlgren and Ehrlén 2011).   
The population growth rate (λ) is a ratio of Nt/Nt-1 that provides an 
estimate for the population’s change or flux over time (Gibson 2002). This ratio 
indicates a population that is increasing in time when λ > 1, a population in 
decline when λ < 1, and a population that is unchanging or in stasis when λ = 1 
(Gibson 2002). The stable population growth theory describes the existence of a 

59 
unique stable population distribution that a density-independent population will 
converge on from an initial composition, which is referred to as the ‘stable size 
distribution’ (Ellner and Rees 2006, Rees et al. 2014).  The ‘stable size 
distribution’ and population growth rate (λ) are estimated directly from the 
discretized survival/growth kernel. 
Results 
Demographic Analyses – Life Table 
From 2002-2014, 228 individuals were included in the census data for 
Arizona fescue (Table 4.4). During that period, the first year survival for Arizona 
fescue was 0.491, meaning that approximately half of 1-year-old individuals 
survived to year 2.  The life expectancy for Arizona fescue during that period was 
2.847, meaning that the number of years an individual is expected to live past 1 
year old was approximately 2.8 years.  The peak expectancy, which is the longest 
life expectancy associated with a given age, was 4.3 years and the age at peak was 
2 years old.  Maximum life span was 13 years indicating that some individuals in 
the population were present in 2002 and survived through 2014.  It should be 
noted that maximum life span is representative of the length of the dataset and 
does not accurately represent the potential maximum life span for this species. 
Life expectancy nearly doubles between age 1 and age 2, and first year 
survival suggests that approximately half of the individuals that survive to reach 
age 1 will survive to reach age 2, which is the age class associated with the 
“longest” life expectancy for this population.  Figure 4.1 illustrates the life cycle 
of a perennial bunchgrass, the annual census period occurs in the month of August 

60 
which corresponds with the vegetative growth period for plants utilizing a C3 
photosynthetic pathway such as Arizona fescue.  Vegetative growth is measured 
for perennial plants by mapping and digitizing of the basal area of the plant, 
which is then inputted into the data frame as size at time t and t + 1. 
IPM Analyses 
Year-to-year changes in size along with the linear regression fit for mean 
size in year t + 1 are found in Fig.4.3 along with survival and growth (Easterling 
2000).  Since the linear relationship between the size at time t and the size at time 
t + 1 with mean growth in genet basal area from t to t + 1 is described as a linear 
function, then the use of size in modelling the population dynamics for Arizona 
fescue is tenable because this indicates a population structured by size (Caswell 
2001, Silvertown and Charlesworth 2001, Dalgleish et al 2011, Ferrer-Caevantes 
2012).  The annual survival probability increases exponentially until genet size in 
time t is approximately 100 cm2 (Fig.4.3), where the probability of survival levels 
off with a 0.95 chance of survival (Rees et al. 2014). 
The size distribution and age-specific trajectory for survival (Fig.4.2 and 
Fig.4.4, respectively) indicate that this species follows a Type III survivorship 
curve that is produced when the age-specific mortality rate decreases with 
increasing t (Pinder et al. 1978).  This finding is consistent with the survival 
curves (Fig.4.3) because genet size has the highest influence on the individuals 
probability of survival, and generally the genets in the largest size classes are also 
the longest lived, therefore the probability of survival increases with size which 
increases with age.  Comparing the current size distribution (Fig.4.2) with the 

61 
survival probability for this population (Fig. 4.3) reveals that the majority of 
individuals in this population belong to the smallest size classes (less than 10 cm2) 
which corresponds with an annual survival probability of approximately 0.65.  
Few individuals in the population have survived and transitioned into size classes 
greater than 100 cm2, corresponding with survival probability of approximately 
0.95, which is also consistent with a Type III survivorship curve (Pinder et al. 
1978). 
Figure 4.5 contains the diagnostic plots for the fitted survival and growth 
objects (derived from the makeSurvObj and makeGrowthObj functions) including 
size range, survival, and life expectancy, which were obtained from the 
diagnosticsPmatrix function of IPMpack.  Since the three lines fall along the (0, 
1) line shown in grey on the middle panel (i.e., survival) of Fig. 4.5, this indicates 
that the appropriate minimum and maximum bin size have been applied to the 
Pmatrix (Metcalf et al. 2014).   
The reiterative model selection process revealed that survival and growth 
are both a function of size.  When precipitation variables were added to linear 
models including size, we were able to determine which precipitation covariates 
had the greatest influence on the survival and growth of Arizona fescue (Table 4.3 
in the Appendix).  The ‘best fit’ model for survival included a quadratic term for 
winter precipitation as follows: logsize + winter precipitation + winter 
precipitation^2.  The ‘best fit’ model for growth of Arizona fescue included 
spring precipitation and is as follows: logsize + spring precipitation.  Once the 

62 
‘best fit’ models were identified, the ‘best fit’ models were incorporated into the 
survival and growth functions of the IPM. 
The fitted survival function (Fig. 4.6) indicates the probability of an 
individual surviving from t to t +1 is strongly associated with winter precipitation.  
The fitted growth function (Fig. 4.6) indicates that growth of Arizona fescue is 
strongly associated with spring precipitation. The ‘best fit’ models for survival 
and growth included parameters that incorporate these relationships into the 
survival and growth functions in the final IPM for Arizona fescue.   
The stable size distribution shows the proportion of size classes in the 
population when it has reached a constant population growth rate (λ) and it is 
skewed towards individuals in the intermediate to large size class range (Fig. 4.7).  
Population rate of increase (λ) is estimated from the final survival/growth kernel 
for this Arizona fescue population and is 0.869.  Since we pooled demographic 
data from 2002-2013, this can be thought of as the average population growth rate 
for Arizona fescue from 2002-2013.  We had expected a population growth rate 
that was in decline (i.e., λ < 1) due to the dramatic shift in forest structure that has 
occurred throughout our study area in the past century.  Low population growth 
rates (λ) may arise for a variety of reasons as decreases in vital rates can be due to 
both fine-scale factors (i.e., soils, site quality, neighborhood competition) and 
coarse-scale factors (i.e., climate and land-use practices) (Jongejans et al. 2010a).  
Since Arizona fescue is widely abundant throughout our study area, we suspect 
two aspects of this dataset that may be affecting the accuracy of this population 
growth rate estimate are: (1) there was a severe drought in 2002 at the beginning 

63 
of the study period which may have lowered the average population growth rate 
from 2002-2013; and (2) the absence of fecundity or reproductive data (Fmatrix) 
may lead to lower estimates of the population growth rate because we are only 
capturing the clonal growth and not the reproductive growth of this population.  
We would require data pertaining to the population’s fecundity prior to 
concluding that this population is in decline.  
The survival/growth kernel describes how individuals survive and change 
in state (e.g., grow, shrink, or remain the same) through the summation of all 
investigated parameters for Arizona fescue (survival, growth, and seasonal 
precipitation) for each individual (Ferrer-Cervantes et al. 2012, Ghosh et al. 2012, 
Merow et al. 2014).  We combined the survival and growth vital rate functions to 
create the survival/growth kernel, the resulting survival/growth kernel for Arizona 
fescue can be found in Fig 4.7.  The contour lines corresponding to the largest 
regions of the kernel, containing the highest density of individuals, correspond 
with the smallest size classes which is consistent with the current size distribution 
of this population (Silverman 1986, Filippone and Sanguinetti 2011).  Similar to a 
matrix for a size-structured population, the kernel shows the smallest values in the 
largest contour interval, representing the highest density of individuals in the 
smallest size class, with the values increasing along the diagonal surface 
representing survival with the possible transition to a neighboring size class 
(Lefkovitch 1965, Ferrer-Caervantes et al. 2012). 
 
 

64 
Discussion  
Consistent with previous descriptions of the phenology of Arizona fescue, 
we found that survival and growth for this C3 perennial bunchgrass was 
significantly linked with winter and spring precipitation (Pearson 1942, Pearson 
1967, Clary 1975).  Our results confirm that the current population size structure 
of this dominant graminoid is consistent with a Type III survivorship curve 
descriptive of a population consisting primarily of many small individuals with a 
low probability of survival and few large individuals with a high probability of 
survival.  Laurenroth and Adler (2008) found that graminoids follow a Type III 
survivorship curve more strongly than forbs, thus graminoid populations tend to 
experience the highest rates of mortality in the youngest age classes.  Jongejans 
and others (2010b) found that increasing life span led to an increase in population 
stability and growth rate. 
We estimated the current population growth rate to be less than 1 (λ = 
0.869) indicating a population in decline.  While this population growth estimate 
for Arizona fescue may be lower than the true population growth rate, it does 
provide land manager with a measure of population change over time, which can 
be used to assess the population in a given year or cumulatively over a period 
(Gibson 2002).  The IPM we have constructed for Arizona fescue provides land 
managers with a tool to predict how this population may change in response to 
various climate and land-use scenarios. We conclude that altering the size 
structure of this perennial bunchgrass population can increase the population 
growth rate and average life span by increasing the number of individuals 

65 
belonging to the larger size classes with higher probabilities of survival.  Shifting 
the size structure of the population to one consistent with the stable size structure 
can increase the probability of survival for individual genets, thus increasing the 
life span and growth rate of the population.  
Perennial bunchgrass genet size is known to exhibit a significant amount 
of interannual variation, significantly influencing the population's survival and 
growth, which can have profound impacts on community composition and 
ecosystem function (Dalgleish et al. 2011).  We have identified winter and spring 
precipitation as climatic factors that have the potential of creating feedbacks 
between the size distribution of genets, the population growth rates, and the 
availability of forage (Dalgleish et al. 2011). 
For populations structured by size, understanding the factors that can alter 
the size distribution is imperative in developing management strategies that 
optimize the resource (i.e., forage production, erosion control) and avoid 
unintentionally altering plant population structure, community dynamics, and 
ecosystem function.  Time series data from size-structured populations, such as 
data derived from permanent chart quadrats, make it possible to analyze how 
climatic variability can affect population survival and growth (Albertson and 
Tomenek 1965, Gibbens et al. 2004, Yao et al. 2006, Laurenroth and Adler 2008, 
Jongejans et al 2010b, Zachmann 2010). 
There are many other biotic and abiotic factors that may influence the 
survival and growth of Arizona fescue such as: fecundity, competition, tree 
canopy cover, temperature, elevation, soils, and fuel load.  This IPM will allow 

66 
for the investigation of other biotic and abiotic factors that may play a role in 
determining the soil moisture available survival and growth of Arizona fescue.  
Alternative grazing practices have been proposed to reduce the negative 
effects of grazing during drought periods in Arizona (Loeser et al. 2005).  Loeser 
and colleges demonstrated the importance of climatic variation in determining the 
ecological effects of grazing practices and recommended implementing adaptive 
management strategies that anticipate this variation.  They concluded that, to 
improve conservation efforts, grazing intensity should be reduced or eliminated 
during periods of drought to avoid the effects of overgrazing key forage plants  
We conclude that adaptive management strategies can use information derived 
from IPM’s constructed for dominant perennial graminoids to predict how 
climatic variation may influence the population dynamics of these key forage 
plants in a given year and adjust land management practices to avoid damaging 
the resource and initiating an unintended shift from a grassland state to a 
woodland state (Briske et al.2008, Loeser et al. 2005).  
Understanding the climatic factors that drive plant population demography 
will allow land managers to make informed decisions regarding land-use practices 
and the implementation of restoration treatments in the Southwest.  As we prepare 
for a future where climate change will likely cause unprecedented shifts in the 
distribution of plant populations, focusing restoration efforts on dominant species 
makes the implementation of landscape-scale restoration initiatives a feasible 
option because the stability of focal species has implications that span the 
spectrum of ecosystems from which they persist.  Incorporating science-based 

67 
approaches into adaptive management strategies enables land managers to predict 
shifts in plant populations and community composition, forage production, and 
ecosystem function.

CHAPTER 5:  
CONCLUSIONS AND MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS 
This thesis documents the tremendous value of long-term permanent chart 
quadrats in providing ecological insights into plant population and community 
dynamics.  The fine-scale resolution of chart quadrat maps allows for spatially 
explicit tracking of individuals over time, which provides essential demographic 
information for understanding herbaceous plant communities (Laurenroth and 
Adler 2008, Zachmann 2010).  The spectrum of ecological insights that chart 
quadrat data can provide today has expanded far beyond what early researchers 
could have imagined when they first established these historic studies.  While 
contemporary applications are vast, applications of these data will continue to 
grow over time as science and technology advances and new innovative 
techniques for data analysis emerge.  
In Chapter 2, I combined chart quadrat data from three distinct historical 
studies into one core dataset that can enable researchers to test ecological theories 
and describe spatial and temporal species and community patterns in the 
ponderosa pine-bunchgrass ecosystems of the Southwest (Zachmann 2010, 
Bakker et al. 2008).  Through sharing this rare and valuable ecological dataset 
with the global scientific community, I hope to inspire agencies and organizations 
to continue funding the annual mapping of permanent chart quadrats.  
Unquantifiable value lies in the scientific legacies that we build, and through the 
maintenance of historic long-term research projects, we can provide opportunities 

74 
for future discovery of innovative ecological solutions to unforeseen 
environmental issues. 
In Chapter 3, I introduced an electronic field data collection method for 
mapping chart quadrats provided evidence that this new method can reduce the 
total amount of time required to process chart quadrat data by approximately a 
half an hour per quadrat.  Reducing the amount of time and resources needed to 
remap these permanent chart quadrats annually allows project managers to 
allocate funding elsewhere in the project budget.  I hope to facilitate the annual 
mapping of this network of permanent chart quadrats by providing a feasible 
alternative to traditional paper-based methods that can reduce the amount of time 
and manual labor needed, streamline the field data collection, and improve quality 
assurance and quality control.  
In Chapter 4, I demonstrated that it is feasible to construct Integral 
Projection Models (IPMs) using data derived from permanent chart quadrats. 
Using climate variables as covariates, such as precipitation in this study, provides 
a powerful way to project an individual species’ fate over time under different 
climate change scenarios.  IPMs provide scientists with a statistically robust and 
mechanistically informed method of addressing old but important ecological 
questions (Merow et al. 2013).  Current data collection procedures allow the 
investigation of factors that limit the growth and survival of plant populations, 
however, limit the ability of users to examine the effect of climate and land-use 
practices on their reproductive output.  I also recommend exploring non-
destructive methods of estimating fecundity so that future users can build an 

75 
Fmatrix and utilize IPMpack’s full capacities (Metcalf et al. 2014).  Dalgleish and 
colleagues (2011) modeled recruitment data at the quadrat-level because field 
mappers are unable to determine which recruits are produced by potential parent 
genets. 
Although we can currently use these data to provide valuable insights into 
the survival and growth of individual plant species in response to both fine-scale 
(i.e., soils, density-dependent competition, tree canopy cover, etc.) and broad-
scale (i.e., climate and land-use practices), the absence of fecundity data does 
limit our ability to derive robust estimates of population growth rates (λ) and 
conduct sensitivity and elasticity analyses.  Modifying the current field 
procedures to include non-destructive quadrat level measurements of fecundity 
can allow for future explorations into the reproductive rate for many species 
without compromising the quality of the data.  
Through the use of IPMpack, I documented the relationship between 
winter and spring precipitation and the survival and growth of a dominant 
perennial bunchgrass, which can be used to inform adaptive management 
strategies in the Southwest.  Since IPMpack is designed to allow users to 
manipulate factors according to specific future climate or land-use scenarios, 
land-managers can use this specialized tool to predict how target species may 
respond to the implementation of silvicultural prescriptions or restoration 
treatments.  
The need to develop new and innovative management strategies that are 
founded in science-based knowledge of ecosystem processes is taking on an 

76 
unprecedented level of urgency (Dalgleish et al. 2010, Adler et al. 2012).  This 
thesis provides documentation of the value of long-term environmental research 
in answering historical, contemporary, and future ecological inquiries into the 
patterns and processes that effect plant community composition and production.  
Through science-based approaches to predicting shifts in plant populations, which 
are the result of anthropogenic climate and land-use change, we can attempt to 
mitigate the impacts of climate change and adapt our land-use practices to restore 
and conserve native plant populations and communities.
