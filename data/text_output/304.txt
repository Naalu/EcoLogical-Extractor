Abstract
There are concerns about whether accelerating worldwide loss of biodiversity will
adversely affect ecosystem functioning and services such as forage production.
Theoretically, the loss of some species or functional groups might be compensated
for by changes in abundance of other species or functional groups such that eco-
system processes are unaffected.
A simulation model was constructed for carbon and nitrogen transfers among
plants and functional groups of microbes and soil fauna. The model was based on
extensive information from shortgrass prairie, and employed stabilizing features
such as prey refuges and predator switching in the trophic equations. Model
parameters were derived either from the literature or were estimated to achieve a
good ®t between model predictions and data. The model correctly represented (i)
the major effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 and plant species on root and shoot
biomass, residue pools, microbial biomass and soil inorganic nitrogen, and (ii) the
effects on plant growth of manipulating the composition of the microbial and
faunal community. The model was evaluated by comparing predictions to data not
used in model development.
The 15 functional groups of microbes and soil fauna were deleted one at a time
and the model was run to steady state. Only six of the 15 deletions led to as much
as a 15% change in abundance of a remaining group, and only two deletions
(bacteria and saprophytic fungi) led to extinctions of other groups. Functional
groups with greater effect on abundance of other groups were those with greater
biomass or greater number of consumers, regardless of trophic position. Of the six
deletions affecting the abundance of other groups, only three (bacteria, saprophytic
fungi, and root-feeding nematodes) caused as much as 10% changes in indices of
ecosystem function (nitrogen mineralization and primary production). While the
soil fauna as a whole were important for maintenance of plant production, no
single faunal group had a signi®cant effect. These results suggest that ecosystems
could sustain the loss of some functional groups with little decline in ecosystem
services, because of compensatory changes in the abundance of surviving groups.
However, this prediction probably depends on the nature of stabilizing mechan-
isms in the system, and these mechanisms are not fully understood.

Introduction
There is widespread concern that the worldwide loss of
biodiversity may cause a degradation in the ability of
ecosystems to provide goods and services such as food,
®bre, clean water, and climate regulation (Myers 1996).
The capacity of ecosystems to provide goods and services
is closely associated with ecosystem function Ð whole
system processes such as primary production, decom-

position, nutrient cycling and water ¯uxes. Whether
ecosystem functioning is in¯uenced by biodiversity is
highly controversial (Schlapfer & Schmid 1999; Wardle
et al. 2000, Naeem 2000).
The loss or exclusion of a species from an ecosystem
may have several kinds of effects: changes in (a) the
abundance of other species, (b) ecosystem function, (c)
both a and b, or (d) neither a nor b. A redundant species
has been de®ned as one whose loss is compensated for
by shifts in abundance of other species, such that
ecosystem function is unaffected (Walker 1992). Many
authors hold that some species are redundant (Lawton &
Brown 1994; AndreÂn et al. 1995; Gitay et al. 1996; but see
Tilman et al. 1997). Walker (1992) ®rst raised the
possibility that entire suites of species in functional
groups may be redundant, and advocated the use of
functional groups as a necessary means to organize
information about an ecosystem and to address the
relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem func-
tion. This approach has been applied to plants (Hooper &
Vitousek 1997).
The potential effects of climate change on biodiversity
and biogeochemistry (C and N ¯uxes) has focused
primarily on aboveground systems. Subsurface species
diversity is less often studied than in aboveground
systems (Moore et al. 1996), but is receiving increasing
attention because soils and sediments are the repository
for much of the earth's biodiversity (Brussaard et al. 1997,
Wall & Virginia 2000). Experimental evidence from
agroecosystems and microcosms suggests that major
components of the detrital food web in soils may be
deleted with little or no decline in decomposition (Beare
et al. 1992) or plant production (Ingham et al. 1985;
Laakso & Setala 1999a, 1999b). However, the complexity
of the soil food web makes it dif®cult to determine
experimentally how the loss of soil functional groups
in native ecosystems may in¯uence ecosystem function-
ing
Tilman et al. (1997) used simulation models to examine
the relationship between ecosystem function and the
diversity of competing plant species. They stated that
further theoretical work is necessary to deal with
multitrophic-level interactions, keystone species, and
functional groups. The present paper presents a model
of a terrestrial belowground food web at the level of
functional groups. There appears to be no generally
accepted de®nition of a functional group (Wilson 1999).
Functional groups are de®ned herein, based on the work
of Gardner et al. (1982), as aggregates of taxa with similar
diets, predators, growth rates and survival rates. Thus no
a priori assumptions are made about the effects of
functional groups on ecosystem function. The model is
based on information from one particular ecosystem ±
native shortgrass prairie ± and incorporates as much
information as possible from the extensive studies
carried out in this system (e.g. Albertson et al. 1966;
Clark
1977;
Woodmansee
et
al.
1978;
Leetham
&
Milchunas 1985; Schimel et al. 1985; Shoop et al. 1989;
Lauenroth & Milchunas 1991).
Paine (1980) distinguished three conceptually distinct
descriptions of food webs. A `connectedness web' merely
identi®es diets of each creature. An `energy ¯ow web'
augments the connectedness web with estimates of
energy or element ¯ux rates. A `functional web' further
identi®es those interactions accounting for the dynamic
response of the system to perturbations such as species
removals. Paine's `functional web' is referred to herein as
a `dynamic web', to avoid confusion with the other uses
of `function' discussed above. Coleman (1985) presented
a connectedness web for shortgrass prairie. Hunt et al.
(1987a) described the `detrital food web' (DFW), a
nitrogen ¯ow web for the same system (Fig. 1). Herein
explicit carbon (energy) is added to the N ¯uxes of DFW
and equations for the rates of processes are included.
This converts the model to a dynamic web that can
respond to perturbations. Previous work by the present
authors includes dynamic webs for subsets of species
from the complete soil food web (Hunt et al. 1984), and a
complete dynamic web at a less detailed level of
resolution (Hunt et al. 1991).
de Ruiter et al. (1995) developed a dynamic food web
model based on DFW and Lotka±Volterra equations. The
present model differs from theirs by including (i) both C
and N cycling, (ii) a plant with variable tissue quality and
shoot/root partitioning, and (iii) more mechanistic fea-
tures in the consumption equations (prey saturation of
predators, prey refuges and predator switching). Details
of the equations governing consumption rates can have
dramatic effects on model stability (May 1973; Pimm
1984; Hunt et al. 1987b; Lawton & Brown 1994). In the
absence of biologically reasonable stabilizing mechan-
isms, even simple food chain models tend to be unstable
over large regions of parameter space (Moore et al.
1993a). Based partly on these considerations, Berendse
(1994) concluded that further progress in understanding
food web behaviour will not come from continued study
of oversimpli®ed systems such as Lotka±Volterra equa-
tions, but will require greater attention to the biology of
interacting populations.
The objectives of the present paper were to develop a
model of trophic dynamics of functional groups in a soil
food web of shortgrass prairie, to evaluate the perform-
ance of the model, and to use the model to examine the
effects of global change, speci®cally elevated CO2 and the
loss of biodiversity, on the capacity of ecosystems to
supply goods and services.

Materials and methods
Model structure
The trophic structure of the dynamic model is the same as
in DFW (Fig. 1). Equations for the rates of processes are
given in Table 1, and symbols for variables and param-
eters in
Tables 2 and 3. Values of parameters are
presented either in the text or tables. The values of some
parameters were estimated using optimization proced-
ures to achieve a good ®t of the model to data (see below),
and no literature citation is given. The values of other
parameters were taken or derived from publications cited
in the text or tables. Many processes are regulated by
reduction factors (de Wit & Goudriaan 1974), which vary
between zero and one, and serve to reduce the rate of a
process below the maximal rate as organism N/C ratios
become nonoptimal (eqn 1; Table 1). The shapes of the
reduction factors (Table 4) were chosen so that organism
N/C ratios in the model are regulated near the values in
DFW, unless stated otherwise.
Plants. Primary
production
in
shortgrass
prairie
is
limited primarily by water (Lauenroth et al. 1978), but
also may respond to N supply (Hunt et al. 1988). Net C
assimilation was assumed to be proportional to shoot N
and a feedback term representing the effect of water
limitation (eqn 2; Table 1). Translocation of C from
shoots to roots is proportional to shoot C and a reduction
factor representing the effect of shoot N status (eqn 3;
Table 1). Root respiration was taken as a ®xed fraction
(0.7) of C translocated to roots. Uptake of soil inorganic N
occurs by a Michaelis±Menten equation with no feedback
term for root N status, based on results of Hunt et al.
(1998). Translocation of N from roots to shoots is
proportional to root N and a reduction factor for the
effect of root N concentration (eqn 4; Table 1).
Shoot C was assigned the value observed at the end of
the growing season in growth chambers (Hunt et al.
1996), which approximates aboveground production
because shoots were not lost through grazing or snowfall
as in the ®eld. Shoot death occurs at a rate of 110% of
shoot C per year; this assumes that some shoot material
is lost to the litter layer during the growing season
through fragmentation of senescent leaves and shedding
of reproductive tissues. Nitrogen loss from the plant
associated with shoot death is only 32% of shoot N per
Fig. 1 Trophic relationships and major N transfers in belowground food web (Hunt et al. 1987a). Fungus-feeding mites are separated
into two groups to distinguish the slow-growing cryptostigmatids from mesostigmatids. Flows omitted from the ®gure for clarity
include transfers from every organism to the substrate pools (death), and from every animal to the substrate pools (defecation) and
to inorganic nitrogen (mineralization). Except for soil inorganic N, every compartment has a corresponding state variable for carbon.

year, accounting for the observation that the majority of
live shoot N is re-translocated to perennial organs in
autumn (Clark 1977). These C and N loss rates, together
with live shoot N/C ratios, yield the observed N/C
ratios of senescent shoots (Hunt et al. 1996). Root death
was also assumed to be proportional to root biomass, but
the turnover rates for C and N were estimated via
optimization, because there is little direct information
about root death and root N re-translocation.
Substrate heterogeneity is represented by dividing
dying plant
tissue
C between
labile
and
resistant
components based on N concentration (eqn 2 in Hunt
1977). Because the resistant component is lower in N than
the labile component, the N/C ratio of the resistant
component of residues was assumed to be only 70% of
the N/C ratio of dying tissues.
Mycorrhizae. Release of N to roots by mycorrhizal fungi
is expressed using equation (4) (Table 1), substituting
mycorrhizal variables for root variables. Transfer of root
C to mycorrhizal fungi is expressed by (3) (Table 1),
substituting root variables for shoot variables. Fungal
respiration was estimated as 70% of the C transferred
from roots. The rate of uptake of soil inorganic N by
mycorrhizal fungi is represented with a Michaelis±
Menten equation modi®ed by a reduction factor for the
feedback effect of mycorrhizal N content (eqn 5; Table 1).
Nonpredatory death of mycorrhizal fungi is density
dependent according to (6) (Table 1), recommended by
Bellows (1981). Dying mycorrhizal fungi are assumed to
have the same N/C ratio as living fungi.
Saprophytic
microbes. The
assumption
of
DFW
was
retained, that bacteria are more effective decomposers
of the labile (soluble) component of residues and fungi of
the resistant (lignocellulose) component. The rate of
decomposition of the labile fraction by bacteria (eqn 7;
Table 1) follows a Michaelis±Menten equation modi®ed
by a factor (see eqn 14 in McGill et al. 1981) that accounts
for substrate particle sizes and density-dependent inter-
ference among microbes. Equation (7) also is used for
fungi, with substitution of fungal biomass and param-
eters. The equation for decomposition of the resistant
fraction (eqn 8; Table 1) is that developed by McGill et al.
(1981; eqn. 15). Respiration was estimated as 28% of
residue decomposition in fungi and 30% in bacteria.
Uptake of soil inorganic N is expressed by (5) (Table 1),
substituting bacterial or saprophytic fungal variables for
mycorrhizal variables.
Nonpredatory death of bacteria and fungi, represent-
ing losses from freezing, drying, pathogens and starva-
tion, is assumed to be density dependent according to (6)
(Table 1). Dead microbes are transferred to labile resi-
dues, except that fungi contain a fraction, estimated at
20%, of resistant compounds such as chitin and melanins
(Burnett 1979; Bell & Wheeler 1986) which is sent to the
resistant pool.
Fauna. The values of most physiological parameters for
faunal groups, including N/C ratios, fraction of food
assimilated, production to assimilation ratios, and the
fractions of faeces and dead organisms transferred to the
labile component of residues, are taken from DFW. Rates
of

Nonpredatory death of all faunal groups is assumed to
be density dependent according to (6) (Table 1), with
power (parameter PML2) of 1.5. Values of PML2 as large as
2.0 impose such strong density dependence that func-
tional group abundances tend to be unresponsive to
environmental changes, and values much smaller than
1.5 lead to extinctions of some functional groups with
only moderate changes in plant characteristics. In a
departure from DFW, any attempt to independently
estimate nonpredatory death rates from demographic
information was abandoned, because many organisms in
arid systems appear to survive in an inactive condition
much of the time (Hunt 1977; Whitford 1996).
Trophic interactions in soil are in¯uenced strongly by
soil structure and the relative sizes of prey and predator
(Elliott et al. 1980); speci®cally the protection of small prey
in soil pores too small to admit predators. For relatively
immobile prey, this concept has been implemented
through absolute prey refuges de®ned in terms of a
®xed level of prey biomass (Hunt et al. 1984). A more
realistic approach is to assume that the size of the
population protected from predators increases continu-
ously as prey biomass increases (eqn 10; Table 1).
According to (10), both the biomass in the refuge and
that outside it increase as the population increases, while
the fraction in the refuge approaches one in very small
populations and zero in very large populations. For
mobile prey that move in and out of soil pores too small to
admit their larger predators, it is assumed that there is no
refuge, but that only a fraction of the prey population is
apparent to the predator at any instant. For mobile prey
with similar sized predators, apparency is assumed to be
100%. For immobile prey which possess a refuge, 100% of
the population out of the refuge is apparent to the
predator. For prey with no refuge, the fraction apparent is
equal to or less than 100% depending on prey mobility
and the relative size of predator and prey. Refuge levels
approximate those reported by Hunt et al. (1984).

in a greater proportion than its abundance among all
prey (May 1977), is not limited only to vertebrate
predators which form search images, but can also be
expressed in invertebrate predators such as microarthro-
pods that choose among different patches of food
according to food density (Bernstein 1984). Thus, switch-
ing might be an important phenomenon in soil food
webs. While no direct evidence for the operation of
switching in soil food webs is available, switching was
incorporated in the model to help assure model stability
(see below). This can be justi®ed on the basis that soil
food webs are observed to persist in nature.
The amount of prey available to a predator (eqn 11;
Table 1)
is
a
function
of
prey
refuges
and
prey
apparency. Total consumption is calculated as a function
of total available prey biomass according to a type II
functional response. Total consumption is then allocated
among prey items according to preference factors and the
switching mechanism by calculating a weighting factor
for each prey item (eqn 12; Table 1). The switching
parameter (Hi in eqn 12) is assigned a value of 2.0 for
predators that switch among prey and 1.0 for those that
do not (Hunt et al. 1991). The weighting factors are
summed over prey items, and the fraction of total
consumption (see above) derived from each prey is
taken as the fraction of total weighting factors contrib-
uted by that prey. Figure 1 identi®es trophic relation-
ships among faunal groups, and Table 6 gives the values
of parameters used in the consumption equations.
Maximal feeding rates were calculated to yield maximal
population growth rates observed under `good' condi-
tions (Hunt et al. 1989). In order to convert literature
values of daily population growth rates to annual rates, it
was assumed that a year of activity in shortgrass prairie
is equivalent to 40 days with nonlimiting temperature
and moisture (Cole et al. 1977). In the absence of
information for every functional group, maximal feeding
rates were assumed the same within taxonomic groups.
For example, the maximal feeding rates for all groups of
nematodes
were
based
on
that
for
fungus-feeding
nematodes (Hunt et al. 1989). Values for the shape
parameters for the functional response (the same as half
saturation constants in a Michaelis±Menten equation)
were estimated by optimization.
The N content of material eaten by root-feeding
nematodes was assumed to be twice that of live roots.
Following DFW, feeding by nematodes was assumed to
cause damage resulting in the death of an additional
1.4 g of roots for every 1.0 g consumed, and the N/C
ratio of killed roots was assumed to be equal to that of
live roots.
Fitting the model to data
In contrast to DFW, the present model was constructed
as a dynamic model, in that the equations for the rates of
plant growth, decomposition, and feeding by fauna were
formulated to operate over a range of possible biomass
values. Thus, the model can be ®tted to dynamic data.
However, the model was also ®tted to data representing
an average or hypothetical steady state level of the state
variables, which is virtually achieved in the model after
30 simulated years. The objective of ®tting a dynamic
model to a hypothetical steady state is that the model can
then be used to examine how the steady state responds to
changes in the environment, plant species, and the
composition of the soil food web.
Table 7 gives the data used. Data for average biomass
C and N/C ratios of mycorrhizal fungi and all faunal
groups were taken from DFW. Levels of plants, detritus,
soil inorganic N, and fumigation biomass were taken
from an experiment in which intact cores from native
shortgrass prairie were transferred to growth chambers

regimes, and water regimes (Morgan et al. 1994; Hunt
et al. 1996). The cores were dominated either by Bouteloua
gracilis (H.B.K.) Lag (blue grama) or Pascopyrum smithii
(Rydb) A. Love (western wheatgrass). Most of the faunal
data on which DFW was based were collected from
upland sites dominated by blue grama. Therefore, the
microbial and plant data from blue grama in the growth
chamber experiment were combined with the DFW data.
Application of the model to the western wheatgrass data
is described below.
Rather than ®tting the model to separate levels of
bacteria and saprophytic fungi as in DFW, it was ®tted to
fumigation biomass C and N/C estimated by chloroform
fumigation and extraction (Monz et al. 1991). A compos-
ite model variable consisting of bacteria, saprophytic
fungi, one half of mycorrhizal fungi, and soil fauna
excluding root-feeding nematodes, was assumed to
correspond to fumigation biomass. The values of bacter-
ial and saprophytic fungal parameters in the model were
estimated to obtain the best ®t of modelled fumigation
biomass and biomass N/C to the data. In a similar
fashion, data for detrital roots (Hunt et al. 1996) were
assumed to correspond to the sum of the labile and
resistant residue pools from the model, plus 2/3 of
bacteria and saprophytic fungi. Root C and N in the
model were assumed to correspond to the sum of
observed large root and crown C and N.
Most model parameters were ®xed at values derived
from the literature. Other parameters were estimated
using simplex optimization (Nelder & Mead 1965;
Hunt et al. 1999). This procedure ®nds the values of
parameters that minimize a measure of departure of
model prediction from data. The measure of model
error
chosen
was
the
sum
of
squared
differences
between the logarithm of model prediction and the
logarithm of the data (Hunt et al. 1998). This measures
the relative model error, as is appropriate for data
such as those used here in which the means range
over several orders of magnitude and the standard
deviations tend to be proportional to the means.
Plants with the C3 photosynthetic pathway are usually
considered to respond more to elevated CO2 than those
with the C4 pathway (Newton 1991). To examine the
effect on the soil food web of a shift in dominance from
C4 to C3 species, a situation was simulated in which
plant species was changed, but other components of the

system were left largely unchanged. This was done by
®tting the model to the data (Table 7) for plant, detritus,
inorganic N, and fumigation biomass in western wheat-
grass (C3) cores from the same growth chamber experi-
ment providing the blue grama (C4) data. In order to
achieve a ®t to data, parameters controlling plant growth,
residue decomposition rates and fungal death rate were
estimated by optimization, while other microbial and all
faunal parameters were left the same as in the blue
grama simulation. Thus, the values of faunal and
mycorrhizal fungal biomass were free to assume new
steady-state values. The effects of elevated atmospheric
CO2 on the soil food web were simulated to achieve a ®t
to data for blue grama in the elevated CO2 treatment
(Table 7). All state variables were initialized as for blue
grama under ambient CO2, and the model was run for
two years. All the values for parameters given above in
the `Model Structure' section apply to blue grama under
ambient CO2, and some apply as well to the other two
datasets. Parameters with different values for the three
datasets are listed in Table 8.
The capability of the model to represent the ecosystem
level effects of functional group deletions was determined
by ®tting the model to dynamic data from a laboratory
experiment (®rst experiment of Ingham et al. 1985) that
determined the effect of the composition of the detrital
web on plant growth. Blue grama was grown with the
addition of different combinations of bacteria, saprophy-
tic fungi, bacteria-feeding nematodes and fungus-feeding
nematodes. The initial values of model state variables
were estimated from inoculum sizes (Ingham et al. 1985).
The model would not be expected to ®t these data without
parameter adjustments, because of major differences
between the Ingham et al. experiment (growth of seed-
lings in sieved and sterilized soil under constant condi-
tions, with the addition of individual species of microbes
and fauna) and data on which the model was based (long
established plants in intact soil cores with a full comple-
ment of microbial and faunal species, and with variable
temperature, water, and photoperiod).
Model stability
The importance of prey refuges, predator switching and
density-dependent death for model stability was evalu-
ated by removing these mechanisms from the model for
blue grama under ambient CO2. Refuges were removed
by calculating the fraction of prey unavailable to the
predator at steady state, reducing prey apparency Pi (eqn
11) by this fraction, and then setting the fraction
unavailable to zero. With these changes, the rate of
consumption of each prey by each predator is unchanged
at steady state. Density-dependent death was removed
by changing parameter PML2 (eqn 6) from a value of
1.5 to 1.0, and assigning new values to the speci®c death
rates (PML1) so that the death rates at steady state were
the same as in the density-dependent case. Switching
was removed by changing all Hi (eqn 12) from 2.0 to 1.0,
and estimating new values for preferences Di so that
consumption of each prey by each predator at steady
state was the same as with switching. Categories of
stability (May 1973) were determined subjectively, by
examining plots of state variable dynamics.

Results
Blue grama under ambient CO2
The values of parameters giving the best model ®t to the
data for blue grama under ambient CO2 are given in the
text and in
Tables 3±6. The measure of model error
minimized during optimization (sum of squares of
{log[model] ± log[data]}) was transformed into a more
intuitive measure by dividing by the number of data
points, taking the square root, exponentiating, and
subtracting 1. The result, a standard relative error
(SRE), was 0.028, indicating that the model steady state
was within 2.8% of most of the 35 kinds of data (Table 7).
Individual errors (data not shown) ranged up to + 7% for
detrital N/C ratio.
Table 9 gives C and N ¯ow rates at steady state. Net
primary production (NPP) was 145 gC m±2 y±1, of which
62% was aboveground. Microbial secondary production
(uptake of residue C minus respiration) exceeded NPP
because of recycling of organic residues (i.e. decompos-
ition of dead microbes and fauna). Net mineralization by
fungi was almost exactly offset by net immobilization by
bacteria. Thus, fauna accounted for all of the 1.7 gN m±
2 y±1 of net mineralization and 68% of gross mineraliza-
tion. Bacteria-feeding nematodes accounted for 61% of
the N mineralized by fauna, and the four functional
groups feeding strictly on bacteria or bacteria-feeders
(see Fig. 1) accounted for 83%. Most of the net miner-
alization was taken up by roots, and most of that taken
up by mycorrhizal fungi was transferred to plants.
Western wheatgrass under ambient CO2
The SRE for the ®t of the model to the western
wheatgrass data was 6.3%. Table 8 gives values of
parameters that differed from blue grama under ambient
CO2. Table 7 gives predicted microbial and faunal
biomass, and Table 9 gives C and N transfer rates.
Wheatgrass NPP was 22% greater than that of blue
grama, with all of the difference in shoots (Table 9). Total
microbial biomass was greater under wheatgrass than
under blue grama, the increase being entirely attributable
to saprophytic fungi. The increased dominance of fungi
over bacteria under wheatgrass (Tables 7 and 9) resulted
from lower nonpredatory death (Table 8). Mycorrhizal
fungi were much less abundant under wheatgrass.
Fungus-feeding fauna had greater biomass, while bac-
teria-feeders and predators had lower biomass. In con-
trast to the situation with blue grama, microbes in
western wheatgrass cores were net N mineralizers
(Table 9). Thus, fauna accounted for only 40% of gross
and 47% of net mineralization. Bacteria-feeding fauna

again accounted for most (57%) of N mineralization by
fauna.
Blue grama under elevated CO2
Only plant parameters and decomposition rates were
estimated to achieve a ®t to the data (Table 8). The SRE
for the ®t of the model to data was 6.3%. Net primary
production increased by 36% (Table 9), but this trans-
lated into only an 18% increase in plant biomass
(Table 7). Increased production under elevated CO2
was accomplished by a 3% increase in maximal photo-
synthesis rate, 22% greater N uptake, and 34% greater
plant
carrying
capacity,
the
latter
attributable
to
increased water-use ef®ciency. Nitrogen supply to the
plant increased as a result of increased uptake by both
roots and mycorrhizae. Additional N was supplied by
lower bacterial immobilization and slightly greater fun-
gal and faunal mineralization, but the largest single
source was depletion of soil inorganic N (Tables 7 and 9).
Fauna accounted for 66% of gross and 92% of net
mineralization, less than under ambient CO2. There were
small increases (3% to 24%) in biomass of all faunal
groups except bacteria-feeding nematodes.
Effects of food web structure on plant growth
Plant parameters estimated to achieve a ®t to the data of
Ingham et al. (1985) include lower maximal photosyn-
thesis (lower light levels), higher carrying capacity (no
water limitation), greater N uptake capacity (fewer old
roots), faster C and N translocation (younger root
tissues), and lower shoot and root death rates (no water
or temperature stresses). Other plant parameters, includ-
ing all reduction factors, were the same as presented
above for blue grama under ambient CO2. The initial
values of substrates were estimated to achieve a ®t to the
data, but were within 20% of the values in Table 7 for
blue grama under ambient CO2. Nematode parameters
were unaltered except that nonpredatory death rates
were reduced by 90% (no temperature or water stresses).
Microbial parameters were unaltered except that death
rates were reduced by 90%, and the single bacterial
species employed was assumed to be unable to attack the
resistant fraction of substrates. The latter assumption was
necessary to prevent the model from predicting N
immobilization by bacteria, which was not observed in
the experiment. Finally, it was assumed that the root
system did not fully explore the soil, because there was a
large pool of soil inorganic N left at the end of the
experiment in the treatment with plants alone (Table 10),
even though plant growth increased in treatments in

which N supply was increased through mineralization
by decomposers. Thus, only a fraction of the inorganic N
initially present in the soil was available to the plants.
Table 10 compares the simulation with experimental
results. The correlations between model and data are
positive and signi®cant at P < 0.05 for plant biomass and
P < 0.10 for residual N.
Model evaluation
The ability of the model to ®t the data is not convincing
evidence of its utility, because model parameters were
estimated to achieve the ®t. This section compares model
predictions to data not used in model development.
Plant responses. Net primary production of blue grama
was 95% of that estimated for shortgrass prairie by ®tting
a more mechanistic plant model to observed shoot and
root dynamics in the ®eld (Hunt et al. 1991). The lower
half-saturation constant for N uptake in western wheat-
grass than blue grama agrees with independent estimates
of Hunt et al. (1998). The root N turnover rate for blue
grama under ambient CO2 (23% per year including losses
to nematodes) is near the 20% per year estimated from
15N dynamics (Woodmansee et al. 1978).
Microbial
responses. Assuming
that
the
percentage
mycorrrhizal infection of roots is proportional to fungal
biomass, the model prediction of greater mycorrhizal
biomass in blue grama than in western wheatgrass
agrees with some observations (e.g. Allen et al. 1984),
but not others (Monz et al. 1994). The discrepancy
between studies may result from seasonal variation in
percentage infection (Allen et al. 1984), and from differ-
ences between ®eld and laboratory samples (Allen et al.
1984; Monz et al. 1994). The increase in mycorrhizal
fungus in blue grama under elevated CO2 agrees with
the results of Monz et al. (1994).
Net N mineralization in blue grama cores under
ambient CO2 (1.7 gN m±2 y±1) was considerably less
than the DFW estimate of 7.6. For a system at steady
state, N mineralization, plant N turnover, and N uptake
must be compatible. Thus, the lower estimate of N
mineralization was dictated by using lower values for
plant N content. In contrast to DFW, N content of dying
shoots was here based on fully senescent shoots (Hunt
et al. 1996), and estimates of root N were reduced to
account for adhering soil N (Hunt et al. 1999). Soil CO2
evolution approximates net shoot C assimilation at
steady state (271 gC m±2 y±1; Table 9). This is within
15% of annual soil CO2 evolution in shortgrass prairie
estimated from a model ®tted to observed seasonal
dynamics of root biomass (Sauer 1978) and soil CO2
evolution (Hunt 1977).
The dominance of bacteria in DFW was based on direct
microscopic counts. Bacterial dominance is incompatible
with present results, because the observed C/N ratio of
fumigation biomass (12, Table 7) is closer to the C/N
ratio of saprophytic fungi (17) than to that of bacteria (4).
Fungal dominance is more consistent with survey results
(Anderson & Domsch 1980). Greater fungus biomass in
cores dominated by a C3 (western wheatgrass) than a
C4 (blue grama) grass agrees with results of Hunt
et al. (1991). Nonpredatory death causes a high turnover
(17 y±1) of saprophytic fungi, which may be reasonable,
given the continuous production of empty hyphae
during fungal growth (Paustian & SchnuÈrer 1987).
Consumers take a much greater fraction of bacterial
secondary production (97%) than of fungal production
(3%). Both percentages are within the ranges estimated
(86±99% for bacteria and 2±33% for fungi) based on soil
food web dynamics (Hunt et al. 1989). Bacteria-feeders
have a relatively greater in¯uence than fungus-feeders
because of the 2.8-fold greater biomass of bacteria-
feeders, 16-fold lower biomass of bacteria than fungi,
and because the dominant bacteria-feeders (nematodes

and amebae) have greater maximal feeding rates than the
dominant fungus-feeders (mites).
Faunal responses
Among fauna, only nematodes were followed in the
experiment providing the data presented in Table 7 on
plant and residue pools (Freckman et al. 1991). Observed
numbers of bacteria-feeding, fungus-feeding, and root-
feeding nematodes all were signi®cantly greater in
wheatgrass than blue grama cores. Ten percent more
total nematodes were observed under elevated CO2 after
one growing season, but this difference was not quite
signi®cant (P < 0.15). In order to compare model predic-
tions to data, nematode biomass (Table 7) was estimated
from observed numbers, multiplying by literature values
for body sizes, and assuming the same sizes in all
treatments. The model prediction of 9% greater total
nematode biomass under elevated CO2 is compatible
with the experimental result. However, the model pre-
dicted a lower biomass of bacteria-feeding nematodes
under western wheatgrass than under blue grama. This
discrepancy might be related to the difference in soil
texture between the blue grama cores (sandy loam) and
wheatgrass cores (sandy clay loam). Ingham et al. (1982)
postulated that nematode species in heavier soils tend to
have smaller individual size because of constraints on
movement; if so, a smaller individual size should have
been used herein in converting nematode numbers to
biomass for wheatgrass cores.
Deleting functional groups
The effects of deleting individual functional groups from
the full detrital web were simulated using a 30-y run of
the model for blue grama under ambient CO2. Figure 2
shows the dynamics of selected variables after the
deletion of bacteria-feeding nematodes. There was an
immediate increase in bacteria, a compensatory increase
in amoebae (the other main group of bacteria-feeders),
and other effects propagating throughout the system.
Dynamics of bacteria and amoebae stabilized after about
two years, while mites and detritus required about ®ve
and 10 years, respectively, to stabilize. There were small
changes in some state variables between 10 and 30 years
(data not shown). After 30 years, deleting bacteria-
feeding nematodes led to (i) a 40% increase in bacteria,
(ii) two- or threefold increases in the other bacteria
feeders, (iii) a 10% decline of saprophytic fungi due to
increased competition from bacteria, (iv) a 14% increase
in detritus, and (v) 50% declines in nematode-feeding
and predatory mites. The effects of deleting other groups
varied widely.
d Deleting bacteria resulted in (i) the extinction of the
four groups depending strictly on bacteria or other
bacteria-feeders (Fig. 1), (ii) 62±88% declines in preda-
tors, and (iii) increases of up to 11% in fungus-feeding
groups.
d Deleting predatory nematodes led to (i) 10±40%
increases in the other groups of nematodes, except
for omnivorous nematodes, which declined by 55%,
and (ii) 40±50% declines in protozoa.
d Deleting saprophytic fungi led to (i) a ®ve-fold
increase in residues, (ii) a 12% loss of mycorrhizal
fungi, (iii) 90% or greater losses of fungal feeders, and
(iv) 27±75% declines in bacteria, bacteria-feeders, and
predators.
d Deleting root-feeding nematodes caused (i) 20±40%
declines in predators and bacteria feeders except for
bacteria-feeding nematodes (ii) slight increases in
saprophytic fungi and fungal feeders, and (iii) a 12%
increase in plant biomass.
d Deleting amebae caused a 60% decline in omnivorous
nematodes, a 30% increase in bacteria-feeding nema-
todes, and 20% increases in predatory microarthro-
pods.
d Deleting either group of fungus-feeding mites caused a
13% decline in predatory mites but no more than a 3%
change in any other group.
d Deleting mycorrhizal fungi caused a 9% decline in
fungus-feeding nematodes and a 36% increase in soil
inorganic N.
d Deleting the other functional groups (predatory mites,
nematode-feeding mites, omnivorous nematodes, ¯a-
gellates, Collembola, and fungus-feeding nematodes)
caused no more than an 8% change in any other group.
The standard relative error SRE (omitting the deleted
group from the calculation) was taken as an overall
measure of the departure of state variables from their
previous values after a deletion. The frequency distribu-
tion of SRE among the 15 deleted groups (not shown)
had two large values (bacteria and saprophytic fungi) in
the upper tail, but it was not possible to rule out a
unimodal distribution. In order to determine which
characteristics of functional groups were responsible for
the effects of group removal, stepwise regression was
used with SRE as dependent variable, and with trophic
level, number of resources, number of consumers (cf.
Figure 1), and biomass (Table 7) of the deleted group as
independent
variables.
The
independent
variables
accounted for only 39% of the variation in the effect of
deletions. The deletion effect was positively correlated
with biomass (r = 0.58, P < 0.05) and with number of
consumers (r = 0.63, P < 0.05). There was a nonsigni®-
cant negative correlation with trophic level. The stepwise
regression procedure ®rst selected the variable for
number of consumers, after which neither biomass nor
B I O D I V E R S I T Y A N D E C O S Y S T E M F U N C T I O N
45
ã 2002 Blackwell Science Ltd, Global Change Biology, 8, 33±50

any other variable entered the equation. However, the
selection of number of consumers merely indicates that
the simple correlation with number of consumers was
slightly higher than that with biomass, and does not
indicate that the number of consumers is signi®cantly
better than biomass as an explanatory variable.
Despite some major effects of deletions on the biomass
of remaining functional groups, only two of the 15
deletions resulted in as much as a 4% change in NPP.
Deleting saprophytic fungi caused decreases of 60% in N
mineralization and 85% in NPP. This occurred because
bacteria by themselves were incapable of decomposing
the resistant component of residues fast enough to
prevent an accumulation of detritus and an increase in
N immobilized in residues. Deleting bacteria led to
reductions of 12% in N mineralization and 13% in NPP.
In this case detritus declined because fungi, which are
capable of faster decomposition of the resistant fraction of
detritus, were relieved from competition with bacteria for
the
N-rich
labile
fraction.
Nitrogen
mineralization
declined because the bacterial branch of the web is
responsible for 83% of mineralization in the complete
detrital web. Deleting mycorrhizal fungi reduced plant N
uptake by 2% and NPP by 3%. Regression analysis, using
the same independent variables as used above to examine
effects of deletions on abundance of other groups, showed
that a single variable, biomass of the deleted group,
accounted for 98.8% (P < < 0.01) of the variation in NPP.
Although deleting individual faunal groups did not
affect NPP, deleting all faunal groups at once led to a
shift from saprophytic fungal to bacterial dominance,
and reduced N mineralization by 61% and NPP by 39%.
Deleting fauna in three groups according to diet: (i)
bacteria-feeding
fauna
(protozoans,
bacteria-feeding
nematodes and omnivorous nematodes), (ii) fungus-
feeding fauna, and (iii) predators (predatory mites and
nematodes) reduced NPP by 7%, 0%, and 2%, respect-
ively.
Model stability
With none or with only one of the three stabilizing
mechanisms in operation, the model was unstable, with
®ve or more functional groups becoming extinct (arbi-
trary lower limit of 10±10 gC m±2, about one individual
per 10 m2 for nematodes), or heading for extinction
(exponential decline at a constant speci®c rate). Including
prey refuges and switching, but not density-dependent
death, led to ®ve extinctions. Switching plus density-
dependent death (excluding refuges) led to a stable limit
cycle with huge amplitudes ± four orders of magnitude
for bacteria. Refuges plus density dependence (excluding
switching) allowed model stability, but with damped
oscillations. Thus, all three mechanisms together were
necessary for critically damped stability of the full
model. However, loss of functional groups can change
these relationships. For example, when bacteria-feeding
nematodes were deleted from the model with all three
stabilizing mechanisms in place, model dynamics (Fig. 2)
changed from a critically damped steady state to a stable
limit cycle with a period of about 0.5 y and an amplitude
that was relatively small except for bacteria.
Discussion
Responses to elevated CO2
In agreement with experimental results, simulated plant
biomass increased under elevated CO2, while plant N
concentration and soil inorganic N level decreased. These
changes suggest greater N limitation of primary produc-
tion relative to water limitation (Hunt et al. 1996), which
has been postulated to ultimately limit plant response to
elevated CO2 in the ®eld (Strain & Bazzaz 1983).
According
to
the
model,
net
primary
production
increased by 36%, mostly as a result of greater water-
use ef®ciency under elevated CO2. Other model changes
included greater biomass of saprophytic fungi and most
faunal groups, 11% greater net N mineralization, and
greater
mycorrhizal
biomass
and
N
transfer
from
mycorrhizae to roots. Thus, changes in the soil food
web served to increase N availability to the plant and
partially to offset the increase in relative plant N
limitation
under
elevated
CO2.
If
this
homeostatic
model response is realistic, it suggests that N limitation
will be less constraining to ecosystem response to
elevated CO2 than previously thought. Model response
to elevated CO2 is reminiscent of apparently adaptive
homeostatic changes observed by Watson & Lovelock
(1983) in a simple model of plant community adjustment
to changes in radiative forcing.
Effects of functional group deletions
Although there are examples in the soil food web (Wall &
Moore 1999) of species deletions that lead to changes in
the abundance of other species and in ecosystem function
(decomposition), there is little doubt that many species
can be lost with little effect on abundance of other species
(Bond 1994; Ehrlich 1994; but see Pimm 1980). The
model's predictions about the effects of deleting decom-
poser functional groups agree with experimental results
(Ingham et al. 1985; Beare et al. 1992; Laakso & Setala
1999a, 1999b) that some groups in the soil food web can
be deleted without much effect on ecosystem function.
The small effect of deleting mycorrhizal fungi on NPP of
blue
grama
is
consistent
with
the
lack
of
strong
mycorrhizal
dependence
in
some
prairie
grasses
(Hetrick et al. 1987), and with observations in this
46

particular species (Hays et al. 1982). The lack of a large
positive response to mycorrhizae has been postulated to
result from `ef®cient soil exploration by ®nely branched
root systems' (Hays et al. 1982), and may also be related
to the lack of phosphorus limitation at the ®eld site
represented by the model (Clark et al. 1980).
Deletion of nine of the 15 groups in the soil food web
model
(all
®ve
microarthropod
groups,
¯agellates,
mycorrhizae, and two out of ®ve nematode groups)
caused no more than a 15% change in biomass of another
group, and no signi®cant effects on mineralization or
NPP. The deletion of six groups (bacteria, saprophytic
fungi, amoebae, bacteria-feeding nematodes, root-feed-
ing nematodes, and predatory nematodes) caused at least
a 15% change in another group. Only two functional
groups, bacteria and saprophytic fungi, caused large
enough changes in NPP (± 13% and ± 85%, respectively)
to be detectable in an experimental study and thus to be
considered nonredundant. Four of the six groups which
caused at least a 15% change in abundance of another
group caused less than a 3% change in NPP, and thus
appear to qualify as redundant functional groups.
The model is useful in (i) showing that ordinary
trophic dynamic mechanisms among functional groups
are suf®cient to account for observed redundancy, and
(ii) providing a theoretical tool for examining redun-
dancy. Compensatory responses to deletions can be
identi®ed in most cases. For example, deleting bacteria-
feeding nematodes led to increases in the other bacteria-
feeding fauna. It is surprising that root-feeding nema-
todes were redundant, because there is no other herbiv-
orous group in the model. Apparently the phenomenon
of redundancy can result from situations other than that
in which two similar groups can substitute for each other
in carrying out the same ecosystem process.
The apparent lack of bimodality in the frequency
distribution of size of deletion effects supports the
hypothesis of Hurlbert (1997) that there may be no
qualitative distinction between groups with large and
small effects. However, only 15 deletions were examined,
which may not be enough to detect weak bimodality. The
lack of an unambiguous relationship between biomass of
the deleted group and the effect of deletion on the
abundance
of
other
groups
supports
the
opinion
(Hurlbert 1997; but see Power et al. 1996 for opposite
opinion) that indices of system response to deletions
should not be scaled a priori to biomass. Identi®cation of
taxa whose preservation may be critical to maintenance
of biodiversity and ecosystem function is an important
challenge for conservation biology (Power et al. 1996).
Only 39% of variation in effects of deleting functional
groups from the model could be accounted for statistic-
ally in terms of simple properties (biomass and the
architecture of trophic relationships) of the deleted
group, even though there was no measurement error
because the model is deterministic. This suggests that
system properties governing the size of deletion effects
are not localized at the deleted group, and may be
distributed diffusely throughout the food web.
It might be inferred that fauna must exert dynamic
control over N mineralization, because they account for
most of net mineralization. Indeed, removing all fauna
dramatically
reduced
net
mineralization
and
NPP.
Nevertheless, no one faunal group had signi®cant effects
on system function. This result differs from that of de
Ruiter et al. (1993) and Moore et al. (1993b), who found
that deleting individual faunal groups from an N ¯ow
model of the detrital web caused reductions of up to 40%
in N mineralization. However, their analyses were not
based on a dynamic model and did not fully allow for
compensatory changes in the remaining groups. O. J.
AndreÂn (pers. comm.) has suggested that the redun-
dancy exhibited by faunal groups in the present model
helps to explain the observation (AndreÂn et al. 1999) that
major ecosystem ¯uxes can be predicted with models
such as Century (Parton et al. 1987), which disregard the
bewildering species numbers and population dynamics
of soil organisms, but only include (implicitly) their
overall activity.
Model stability
May (1973) pointed out that including the `realistic
complications' of species interactions such as switching,
density-dependent death and spatial heterogeneity `can
easily stabilize' models. Full stability (critical damping)
of the soil food web model required three stabilizing
mechanisms: density-dependent death, prey refuges, and
predator switching. Of these mechanisms, the best
experimental
evidence
exists
for
refuges.
Density-
dependent death can be considered a surrogate for
mechanisms known to operate in soil food webs, such as
disease, parasites, and, for some groups, predation
among species within a functional group. Switching is
a plausible but undocumented mechanism. O. J. AndreÂn
(pers. comm.) has pointed out that the inclusion of
stabilizing mechanisms is probably responsible for the
tolerance of the model to the loss of many of the
functional groups. If this is correct, greater attention to
stabilizing mechanisms is warranted in studies of the
relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem func-
tion. Stabilizing mechanisms not yet included in our
model are seasonal variation in resource availability
(Ebenhoh
1988)
and
explicit
spatial
heterogeneity
(Huston & DeAngelis 1994) such as rhizosphere vs.
nonrhizosphere soil, litter vs. soil layers, and soil pore
size distributions.

The results presented herein must be quali®ed in
several important ways. First, deletions of multiple
functional groups, which may have more severe conse-
quences than single deletions, have not been systemat-
ically examined. Second, the effects of deleting functional
groups were tested in a single system (blue grama under
ambient CO2 and a constant environment), and the
relationships between decomposer groups and ecosys-
tem function may vary signi®cantly among ecosystems
(GonzaÂlez & Seastedt, 2001). Finally, the stability of the
simpli®ed systems remaining after deleting groups has
not been examined systematically, and such stability may
be critically important to ecosystem function in a chan-
ging environment (Berendse 1994; AndreÂn et al. 1995).
