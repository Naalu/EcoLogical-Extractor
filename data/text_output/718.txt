Effects of Smoke and Fire-related Cues on Penstemon barbatus Seeds
ABSTRACT.—Previous research has found that exposure to ﬁre-related cues enhances
germination of some plant species, and such species may exist in frequent-ﬁre southwestern
United States Pinus ponderosa forests. I performed four greenhouse experiments with Penstemon
barbatus, a perennial forb common in P. ponderosa forests, testing seed responses to liquid and
air smoke, charred P. ponderosa wood and leachate, heat and emergence substrates. Liquid
smoke increased P. barbatus emergence to as high as 63%, 44% greater than controls, and
enhanced emergence in all 4 experiments. Air smoke produced by burning P. ponderosa litter
for 15 min appeared to increase emergence similar to liquid smoke. In contrast, P. ponderosa
charred wood and charred wood leachate did not improve emergence, and sometimes
inhibited positive effects of smoke. Heating samples at 100 C for 30 min did not affect
emergence. Substrate and liquid smoke interacted in one experiment, with smoke increasing
emergence more sharply on basalt and potting soil than on limestone soil. These greenhouse
ﬁndings have practical implications for germinating P. barbatus, but need testing under
ﬁeld conditions to evaluate their importance in this species’ population biology after ﬁre in
P. ponderosa forests.
INTRODUCTION
Seeds of some plant species inhabiting ﬁre-prone ecosystems are thought to have evolved responses to
ﬁre cues triggering germination (Keeley, 1991; Dixon et al., 1995; Van Staden et al., 2000). These cues
presumably cause germination to coincide with post-ﬁre environments favorable for seedling survival
and growth (Baldwin et al., 1994; Baskin and Baskin, 1998; Bell, 1999). In frequent-ﬁre Australian heath
ecosystems, for example, Burne et al. (2003) found that spraying soil with liquid smoke induced
emergence of the shrub Grevillea rudis Meisn. from the soil seed bank whereas no emergence occurred
on untreated plots. In greenhouse experiments with 45 species from frequent-ﬁre California chaparral,
Keeley (1987) reported that Adenostoma fasciculatum Hook. & Arn. charred wood enhanced germination
of 25% of the species, while 25% of the species exhibited heat-stimulated germination.
Fire-germination relationships may also be important in the plant ecology of frequent-ﬁre
southwestern United States Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson forests, but little is known about these
relationships in these forests. Fire-return intervals for presettlement P. ponderosa forests before ﬁre
exclusion in the late 1800s, for example, averaged 3.7 y near Flagstaff in northern Arizona (Fule´ et al.,
1997). More than 800 plant species occur in northern Arizona P. ponderosa forests (McDougall, 1973),
and it seems plausible that some species have evolved germination strategies in accordance with frequent
surface ﬁres long characteristic of these forests. In preliminary experiments I found that emergence of
the perennial forb Penstemon barbatus (Cav.) Roth inhabiting southwestern P. ponderosa forests responded
strongly to liquid smoke, so I conducted several experiments to more closely examine its responses to
ﬁre-related cues. Penstemon barbatus has small seeds (»0.8 mg) thought to be primarily wind dispersed,
and as with many Penstemon is believed to be an opportunistic species colonizing disturbed habitat (Fule´
et al., 2001). This paper reports the results of 4 greenhouse experiments testing emergence responses
of P. barbatus seeds to liquid and air smoke, charred P. ponderosa wood and leachate, heat and emer-
gence substrates.
METHODS
General experimental procedures.—Penstemon barbatus seeds collected around Flagstaff, Arizona, were
stored at 5 C for 12–17 mo, and used in all 4 experiments. Based on tetrazolium testing of 25 seeds
(Association of Ofﬁcial Seed Analysts, 2000), the seed lot used in these experiments had a viability of
88%. For all experiments, 16 P. barbatus seeds per pot were lightly pressed in 4 rows of 4 seeds on top of
either natural or potting soil in 700-cm3 square plastic pots. I ﬁlled pots with 300 cm3 of sterile potting
soil (United Industries Co., St Louis, Missouri). If required in a speciﬁc experiment, I also placed 120
cm3 of natural soil on top of the potting soil. Commercially available liquid smoke (Wright’s Brand,
Roseland, New Jersey), diluted to desired concentrations using deionized water and applied on top of
404

seeds in soil, was used for experiments requiring liquid smoke. I arranged pots randomly on
a greenhouse bench in a Northern Arizona University greenhouse (temperature » 24 C) and kept
samples moist by daily watering with tap water. To check for seed contamination, which did not occur,
2–4 pots per experiment containing only soil were randomly interspersed with treated pots.
I counted emerging Penstemon barbatus every 10 d and ran experiments for 60 d, with 90–95% of
emergence in all experiments occurring in the ﬁrst 30 d. Experiment 1 began on 12 March, Experiment
2 on 5 May, Experiment 3 on 28 July and Experiment 4 on 22 August 2004. All experiments occurred
under natural lighting except for Experiment 1, which also occurred under 2 h of artiﬁcial lighting daily
to supplement natural lighting. I used the percent of 16 seeds (all seeds including non-viable seeds)
emerged per pot as the response variable for analysis of variance (ANOVA) performed with the software
SAS JMP (SAS Institute, 2002). For mean separation, I used Fisher’s protected least signiﬁcant
difference with a ¼ 0.05. Raw data approximated equal variance (Levene test) and normality as-
sumptions (Shapiro-Wilk test), and arcsin transformations did not change statistical conclusions. Spe-
ciﬁc procedures and ANOVA models for each experiment are given in the following sections.
Experiment 1.—This experiment was a 2-factor, split-plot factorial design with 2 levels (none, exposure
to 100 C for 30 min) of the whole plot factor heat, and 2 levels (none, 60 ml of 10% liquid smoke) of the
subplot factor liquid smoke. Locally collected (358169140N, 1118429350W) native soil derived from basalt
was placed on top of potting soil, and seeds were sown on top of the basalt soil. Pots including soil and
seeds were placed in an electric oven, heating was performed on all heated samples at once, and then
liquid smoke was applied to smoke samples. I randomly assigned treatments to pots, and used 3 pots
(replicates) per treatment combination for a total of 12 pots.
Experiment 2.—This experiment was a single-factor, completely random design with 6 treatments
(60 ml of 5, 10 or 20% liquid smoke, 30 ml charred wood, 10% liquid smoke þ 30 ml charred wood
and control) and 5 replicates per treatment for a total of 30 pots. Charred wood (blackened but
not ashed with no visible bark remaining) was prepared by burning Pinus ponderosa logs in a wood-
burning stove and grinding burned pieces to pass a 4-mm sieve. About 5.5–6.5 g of charred wood com-
prised 30 ml by volume. I used potting soil for this experiment, placed the charred wood on top of
the potting soil forming a discontinuous layer of charred wood averaging 1 mm thick, and sowed seeds
intermixed with the charred wood.
Experiment 3.—To asses relative effects of air and liquid smoke and Pinus ponderosa charred wood
leachate, this experiment employed a 3-factor, split-plot factorial design with 2 levels each of air smoke
(none, 15 min exposure), liquid smoke (none, 60 ml of 10% concentration) and charred wood leachate
(none, 60 ml of 10 g/100 ml concentration). Because air smoke treatments were applied to all air-
treated samples at once, the whole plot factor was air smoke and the subplot factors were liquid smoke
and charred wood leachate. Treatments were randomly assigned to pots, and 3 replicates were used for
each of the 8 treatment combinations. I used potting soil overlaid with native soil derived from
limestone (358079130N, 1118399290W) for this experiment.
Air smoke treatments were performed on pots containing soil and seeds in a home-made smoker. The
smoker consisted of a 40 3 20 cm closed barbecue grill containing Pinus ponderosa needles, bark, twigs
and cones for fuel, 3 m of coiled 1.3-cm diameter copper wire to carry smoke and minimize heat transfer
to the chamber, a 62 3 75 cm enclosed plywood and glass chamber for housing samples, and a fan
enclosed at the top of the chamber to pull smoke into the chamber. I monitored temperatures within
the chamber using a thermometer, and temperatures remained within 6 1 C of ambient temperature
(»25 C) during smoker operation. Smoke was pumped into the chamber continuously and remained
inside the enclosed chamber for the duration of the exposure time. I prepared charred wood leachate
by soaking pieces (,3 cm diameter) of charred P. ponderosa wood for 24 h in deionized water, and added
leachate or liquid smoke to randomly assigned samples after air smoke treatments.
Experiment 4.—This experiment tested whether effects of liquid smoke were consistent across
emergence substrates, and consisted of 3 levels (basalt, limestone or potting soil) of soil and 2 levels of
liquid smoke (none, 60 ml of 10% concentration) in a completely random factorial design with 5
replicates per treatment combination for 30 total pots. The same locally collected basalt and limestone
soils (both at »2200 m elevations) used in Experiments 1 and 3 were used in this experiment. I analyzed
the upper 15 cm of these soils for texture (hydrometer method), pH (1:2 soil:0.01 M CaCl2) and organic

C and total N (instrumental C/N analyzer). The basalt soil was a pH 6.08 loam (40% sand, 47% silt,
13% clay) with 1.9% organic C and 0.13% total N. The limestone soil was a pH 6.45 sandy loam
(62% sand, 32% silt, 6% clay) with 1.3% organic C and 0.08% total N.
RESULTS
Experiment 1: heat and liquid smoke.—Main effects were signiﬁcant for liquid smoke (F ¼ 26.72, P ,
0.01), but not for heat (F ¼ 0.75, P ¼ 0.43). Liquid smoke at 10% concentration increased Penstemon
barbatus emergence by 44% above the control to 63% emergence (Fig. 1). Heat and liquid smoke did
not interact (F ¼ 0.0, P ¼ 1.0), and emergence in the heat þ smoke treatment did not differ from the
smoke only treatment.
Experiment 2: liquid smoke concentration and charred wood.—One-way ANOVA was signiﬁcant (F ¼ 15.20,
P , 0.01), with emergence in treatments incorporating only liquid smoke at least 36% greater than
emergence in Pinus ponderosa charred wood and control treatments (Fig. 2). Emergence did not differ
among 5, 10 and 20% liquid smoke concentrations, ranging from 44–54% emergence. Charred wood,
charred wood þ 10% smoke and control treatments resulted in emergence ,8%.
Experiment 3: air smoke, liquid smoke and charred wood leachate.—Liquid smoke was the strongest main
effect (F ¼ 10.09, P , 0.01), followed by air smoke (F ¼ 5.31, P ¼ 0.08) and charred wood leachate (F ¼
2.93, P ¼ 0.11). Interactions were not important (P . 0.48) except for a marginally signiﬁcant liquid
smoke 3 charred wood leachate (F ¼ 3.51, P ¼ 0.08). The air smoke þ liquid smoke treatment induced
the highest emergence (58%), but because of large variation did not differ signiﬁcantly from a 35%
mean emergence in the control (Fig. 3). Air smoke and liquid smoke emergence means differed by 6%,
an insigniﬁcant difference. Treatments containing charred wood leachate exhibited signiﬁcantly lower
emergence than the air smoke mean (50%) only in treatment combinations where liquid smoke was not
applied in combination with charred wood leachate.
Experiment 4: substrate and liquid smoke.—Substrate used as the emergence medium was not a signiﬁcant
main effect (F ¼ 0.35, P ¼ 0.71), in contrast to liquid smoke (F ¼ 31.51, P , 0.01). Substrate and liquid
smoke interacted (F ¼ 3.99, P ¼ 0.03), however, with liquid smoke promoting emergence more strongly
on potting and basalt soil than on limestone soil (Fig. 4). Potting soil with liquid smoke produced the
highest emergence (54%), and emergence did not differ between basalt and limestone soil for smoke
or non-smoke treatments.

DISCUSSION
Smoke improved Penstemon barbatus emergence in all 3 factorial experiments, and increased
emergence by more than 36% above a control treatment in the one-way experiment. Experiment 3
suggested that similar emergence was induced by liquid smoke and more natural air smoke produced by
burning Pinus ponderosa litter. Several studies have found that different types of smoke (air or liquid) and
materials burned to produce smoke (native or not native to the ecosystem in which a study species occurs)

promote emergence similarly for many species beneﬁting from smoke (Brown and Van Staden, 1997;
Blank and Young, 1998; Van Staden et al., 2000). Flematti et al. (2004) recently isolated a butenolide
compound contained in any cellulose-derived smoke thought to cause smoke’s cueing effects.
In contrast to smoke, Pinus ponderosa charred wood and charred wood leachate did not improve
emergence in either of the experiments where they were applied. Charred wood counteracted positive
effects of liquid smoke in Experiment 2, and in Experiment 3, charred wood leachate þ air smoke
resulted in lower emergence than air smoke only. Keeley et al. (1985) found that charred wood from the
shrub Adenostoma fasciculatum in California chaparral increased germination of some forbs, while
reducing germination of others. Although charred wood from species other than the P. ponderosa used
in these experiments may beneﬁt P. barbatus seeds, P. ponderosa is the dominant or only tree in local
forests. Lodhi and Killingbeck (1982) identiﬁed caffeic acid and other allelochemicals in P. ponderosa
needles and bark, which reduced germination of Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash and Andropogon
gerardii Vitman in North Dakota P. ponderosa forests. Their ﬁndings suggest allelopathic chemicals
in P. ponderosa wood and leachate may have resulted in the observed reductions in P. barbatus emergence
after exposure to these materials in the present experiments. Organic matter in the charred wood,
however, may also have absorbed and ‘‘de-activated’’ smoke cues.
Across experiments including Experiment 4 testing substrate effects, liquid smoke more sharply
increased Penstemon barbatus emergence above controls on potting and basalt soil than on limestone soil.
Basalt soil used in these experiments exhibited organic C concentrations 0.6% higher and pH 0.37 units
lower than limestone soil, and potting soil likely contained the most organic C. Keeley (1987) also found
that substrate (ﬁlter paper or potting soil) affected germination of 23/36 (64%) California chaparral
species in experiments examining inﬂuences of heat and charred wood. It is uncertain if smoke cues
interacted with soil pH or other soil characteristics affecting P. barbatus emergence in my experiments.
Greenhouse ﬁndings from these experiments need to be tested in the ﬁeld, and predict that
Penstemon barbatus emergence in Pinus ponderosa forests is enhanced when seeds are exposed to smoke
during ﬁres, but not killed by intensive heat, and are located away from P. ponderosa charred wood. Fires
in presettlement Arizona P. ponderosa forests occurred almost exclusively from May–August (Fule´ et al.,
1997), and it is difﬁcult to assess whether contemporary prescribed burns often conducted in
September–October (Abella, 2004) differentially affect P. barbatus emergence. Penstemon barbatus ﬂowers
primarily in May–June with seeds maturing by mid-late summer, and emergence in some Penstemon

species is enhanced by 30 d of chilling (Meyer et al., 1995). The ecological importance of ﬁre cueing in
P. barbatus population biology and whether it is affected differently by summer or fall burns could
depend on: (1) if ﬁre inﬂuences immature or mature on-plant seeds the same as seeds on or in the soil,
(2) whether chilling is required before smoke can serve as a cue or if smoke enables seeds to bypass any
chilling requirements, (3) how long smoke cues persist with seeds for triggering emergence, (4)
whether seed presence on-site coincides with a period of exposure to air or soil-persistent smoke and (5)
possible interactions of smoke cueing with other cues not directly related to ﬁre such as alternating
temperature, precipitation or light. These other cues may also inﬂuence P. barbatus emergence and
subsequent seedling survival (Meyer et al., 1995). Greenhouse ﬁndings from these experiments have
practical implications for germinating P. barbatus, and future research could examine if and under what
environmental conditions smoke cueing affects recruitment of this species in native communities.
