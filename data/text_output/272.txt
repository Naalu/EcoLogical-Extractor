Abstract 
Monitoring 
of ecological 
restoration 
treatments often focuses on changes in community 
structure and function. We suggest that long-term 
changes in community composition also need to be 
explicitly considered when evaluating the success of 
restoration treatments. In 1992, we initiated an 
experiment in a ponderosa pine-bunchgrass ecosys­
tem to evaluate responses to restoration treatments: 
(a) thinning the overstory vegetation ('thinning'), (b) 
thinning plus forest floor manipulation with periodic 
prescribed burning ('composite'), and (c) untreated 
'control.' Treatments were further stratified by forest 
patch type: presettlement tree clumps (trees that 
established prior to the onset of fire exclusion in 
1876), patches of retained postsettlement trees, 
patches 
where 
all 
postsettlement 
trees

removed, and 
remnant grass openings. Species 
richness did not differ among treatments for 10 
years, but was highest in the composite treatment in 
II th and 12th year after initial treatment. Commu­
nity composition diverged among treatments 5 years 
after initial treatment, and compositional changes 
were greatest in the composite treatment. Species 
richness and composition differed among patch 
types prior to treatment. Remnant grass patches 
were the most diverse and presettlement patches 
were the least diverse. FoJlowing treatment, species 
richness in the postsettlement removed and retained 
patches, gradually approached levels found in rem­
nant 
grass 
patches. 
Compositional 
differences 
among patch types changed a little by 2005. Species 
richness at the 2 m2 scale increased only where the 
overstory was thinned and the understory was 
burned. However, these changes may not be detect­
able for many years, and can vary temporally in 
response to events such as severe droughts. Nonna­
tive species establishment may 
be reduced by 
scheduling longer bum intervals or by refraining 
from burning where fuel loads are not hazardous, 
though these options may hinder goals of increasing 
diversity. Restoring species diversity and community 
composition continues to be more difficult than 
restoring ecosystem structure and function.

Introduction 
Evaluations of management or ecological restoration 
treatments should consider changes in community 
structure, function, and composition, but these com­
munity attributes are not given equal weight in most 
assessments. Structural components such as tree 
density are the simplest to measure and interpret 
(e.g., Covington et al. 1997). Functional attributes 
such as net primary productivity are more difficult to 
measure, and therefore, correlated variables, such as 
peak herbaceous standing crop, are used instead (e.g., 
Tilman et al. 2002; Moore et al. 2006). Composi­
tional metrics can be difficult to interpret given their 
multidimensional nature (Legendre and Legendre 
1998; McCune and Grace 2002) and are rarely 
considered in the context of ecological restoration, in 
part because long-term data are necessary to detect 
compositional trends (Lindborg and Eriksson 2004). 
However, we suggest that composition should be 
explicitly considered because having restored eco­
system structure and functioning does not necessarily 
mean that composition has also been restored (Lock­
wood and Pimm 1999), and often there is not a direct 
relationship between species diversity, composition, 
and ecosystem functioning (Schwartz et al. 2000; 
Cortina et al. 2006). For example, an area with the 
desired plant cover and standing crop could be 
dominated by nonnative species, and therefore, be a 
failure with respect to plant community composition 
(e.g., Christian and Wilson 1999). Given that a 
community's composition is the net effect of births, 
deaths, immigrations, and emigrations of individuals 
of many species, composition is likely to respond 
more slowly than many structural and functional 
attributes. However, we often do not know the 
temporal or spatial scales, at which species richness 
and composition change given the differences in 
lifespan and dispersal capabilities among species. 
Montane ponderosa pine forests in the southwest­
ern United States have been fundamentally altered 
during the past century through the synergistic effects 
of livestock overgrazing, fire exclusion, overstory 
harvesting, and climatic events (Allen et al. 2002). 
Together, these have resulted in dramatic increase in 
the density of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & 
C. Lawson var. scopulorum Engelm.), which in tum 
have led to reduced diversity and altered assemblages 
of herbaceous plants (Covington and Moore 1994; 
~ Springer 
Bakker and Moore 2007). Diversity theories predict 
that species richness will increase when a dominant ­
species is removed from a community (Grime 1979; 
Tilman 1982; Keddy 2005). Thus, thinning dense 
stands of ponderosa pine should allow for the 
colonization and establishment of herbaceous under­
story species, leading to greater diversity in the 
understory. However, removing a dominant plant 
does not always lead to increased diversity (e.g., 
MacDougall and Turkington 2005; Keddy et al. 
2006). 
In 1992, a long-term restoration project was 
implemented in a ponderosa pine-bunchgrass ecosys­
tem in northern Arizona. The project involved 
thinning the ponderosa pine overstory, and conduct­
ing repeated prescribed burns. The original goals of 
this project were to restore the pre-Euroamerican 
settlement forest structure (tree density, age and 
spatial structure; Mast et al. 1999) and to increase 
herbaceous understory standing crop. These original 
goals were successfully met (Covington et al. 1997; 
Moore et al. 2006), though restoration success was 
highly dependent on local microenvironment; that is, 
herbaceous standing crop beneath patches of trees 
was generally unresponsive to treatments, even 
though areas were burned periodically (Laughlin 
et al. 2006). 
In this article, we evaluated herbaceous understory 
species richness and community composition in areas 
subject to no treatment ('control'), a one-time 
selective tree thinning in 1993 ('thinning'), and 
selective tree thinning followed by prescribed fires 
every 4 years ('composite'). We predicted that spe­
cies 
richness 
would 
increase 
and 
community 
composition would diverge within treated areas 
relative to control areas. We also examined whether 
differences in richness and composition among patch 
types (i.e., forest patches ranging from full canopy to 
no canopy) persist following restoration, and whether 
response to restoration treatment differs among patch 
types. Remnant grass patches are productive and 
species rich, and provide the best example of 
reference conditions with respect to the understory 
vegetation in this system (Laughlin et al. 2006). We, 
therefore, used these patches as the reference to 
assess restoration success. We predicted that herba­
ceous vegetation in patches where small-diameter 
trees were removed, would become more similar to 
the remnant grass patches. The long-term duration of 

Plant Ecol (2008) 197:139-151 
141 
this project (1992-2005) permitted us to evaluate the 
temporal dynamics of richness and composition. 
Finally, we tested whether individual plant species 
could be identified as indicators of restoration 
treatments or patch types. 
Methods 
Study system 
This study was conducted at the Gus Pearson Natural 
Area (GPNA), located ~ 10 km northwest of Flag­
staff, Arizona in the Fort Valley Experimental Forest 
in the Coconino National Forest. The ~4 .3 ha study 
site ranges from 2,195 to 2,255 m in elevation, and 
has a flat to gently rolling topography. Soils are 
derived from Tertiary basalt flows and cinders, and 
are classified as a Brolliar stony clay loam and a 
complex of fine, smectitic Typic Argiborolls and 
Mollie Eutroboralfs (Kerns et al. 2003). The average 
annual temperature is 7.5°C. Average annual precip­
itation is ~ 570 mm, and follows a bimodal pattern 
with approximately half of the precipitation occurring 
as rain in July and August, and half as snow in the 
winter (NOAA 2005). Drought was common during 
this study. A severe drought occurred in 2002, when 
precipitation was 77% below normal at the study area 
(Moore et al. 2006). 
The study area has been ungrazed by live stock for 
more than 50 years (Olberding 2000). A few trees 
were removed from GPNA in 1894, but it did not 
receive commercial harvest after that time (Avery 
et al. 1976). Although timber harvest was minimal, 
tree density in] 992 (prior to treatment) was 
>3,000 trees ha- I (Covington et al. 1997). These 
high densities existed due to favorable climatic 
events for regeneration and the exclusion of fire from 
the study area since 1876 (Dietrich 1980). 
Ponderosa pine is the only tree species on the 
study site. The understory is dominated by native 
perennial graminoid species, including Festuca ari­
zonica Vasey (Arizona fescue), Elymus elymoides 
(Raf.) Swezey ssp. elymoides (bottlebrush squirrel­
tail) , Muhlenbergia montana (N utt .) A. S. Hitchc. 
(mountain muhly), Poa fendleriana (Steud.) Vasey 
(muttongrass), 
and 
Carex 
geophila 
Mackenzie 
(White Mountain sedge) . Dominant native perennial 
forb species include Vicia spp, (combination of 
V. americana Muhl. Ex . Willd. and V. pulc~ ella 
Kunth), Astragalus rusbyi Greene (R usby's milk­
vetch), Lupinus argenteus Pursh (silvery lupine), 
Achillea millefolium L. var. occidentalis DC. (wes­
tern yarrow), and Cirsium wheeleri (Gray) Petrak 
(Wheeler's thistle). Six exotic species were recorded 
at the site during this study, with the two mo st 
common being the biennial forb Verbascum thapsus 
L. (common mullein) and the perennial graminoid 
Poa pratensis L. (Kentucky bluegrass). 
Experimental design 
Fifteen treatment plots, each 0.2-0.3 ha, were est ab­
lished in ]992. Each treatment plot was assigned to 
one of the three treatments (control, thinning, or 
composite) to yield five replicates per .treatment. The 
five control plots were located nonrandomly on one 
side of the study site, whil e the thinning and 
composite treatment plots were assigned randomly. 
This design ' was necessary so that the fuel bre ak 
created 
by the treated plots would protect the 
historical buildings of the adjacent Fort Valley 
Experimental Station. The control plots are located 
at the same elevation, and have similar slopes, 
aspects, and 
so il types as the treatment plots. 
Moreover, total herbaceous standing crop was the 
same in control and treatment plots prior to treatment 
(Moore et al. 2006). Therefore, we believe that all 
plots possessed the same environmental potential at 
the beginning of the experiment. Detailed accounts of 
the experimental design, thinning and prescribed bum 
characteristics, treatment protocol, and effects on 
other ecosystem components are available in Cov­
ington et al. (1997) and subsequent articles (Feeney 
et aJ. 1998; Kolb et al. 1998; Kaye and Hart 1998 ; 
Mast et al. 1999; Skov et al. 2004; Boyle et al. 2005; 
Moore et aJ. 2006). Here, we briefly summarize the 
key aspects relevant to this study. 
In 
1992, a 2.4 m tall 
electrified fence was 
con structed to exclude ungulates from the experiment 
to control for grazing effects. Fuhlendorf and Engle 
(2004) demonstrated that grazing and fire interact in 
grassland systems, but, since our system did not 
evolve in an environment of intense grazing (Milch­
unas 2006), we focused on the possible interactions 
between fire and overstory thinning. We acknowl­
edge that epizoochory (seed dispersal via animals)

may be hampered due to this design. The thinning 
and composite treatments were thinned from below 
(i.e., small trees from lower crown classes were 
removed; Smith et al. 1997) in the fall of 1993, 
retaining all presettlement trees (defined as trees 
established prior to 1876 and/or trees >37.5 ern 
diameter at breast height (dbh); Fule et al. 1997) and 
three postsettlement trees to replace each dead 
presettlement tree or stump (Fule et al. 1997; Mast 
et al. 1999). Thinning resulted in the removal of 
~2,200 trees ha- I per hectare of the >3,000 trees per 
hectare that were present before the study began in 
1992 (Covington et a!. 1997), including most of the 
postsettlement trees. All slash was removed by hand, 
while all extant presettlement coarse woody debris 
were retained (Covington et al. 1997). 
In the composite treatment, the forest floor was 
manipulated by raking the litter layer aside, removing 
accumulated forest floor duff, and returning the 
current (~3 years) litter layer to the site. To simulate 
the presettlement condition of a grass-dominated 
understory, which carried frequent fire, approxi­
mately 670 kg ha" of herbaceous vegetation from 
Hart Prairie (4.8 km to the north) was harvested in 
late September 1994, and scattered across the plots 
(Covington 
et al. 
1997); 
this 
supplementation 
occurred only 
once. 
The composite treatment 
received an initial prescribed bum in 1994, and 
additional prescribed burns in 1998 and 2002. All 
bums were conducted in October, after data collec­
tion was completed for that year. 
The area within each treatment plot was stratified 
into four patch types: 'presettlement,' 'postsettlement 
removed,' 'postsettlement retained,' and 'remnant 
grass' (Laughlin et al. 2006). Presettlement patches 
consisted of groups of two or more large presettle­
ment trees (mostly> 30 cm at dbh). Postsettlement 
retained patches consisted of groups of small-diam­
eter «30 ern dbh) postsettlement trees, thereby 
representing dense forest 
habitat. Postsettlement 
removed patches consisted of areas where all post­
settlement trees were thinned and removed from the 
site, thereby creating openings in the canopy. Rem­
nant grass patches were small open areas consisting 
of native grasses and forbs. Since the remnant grass 
patches represent diverse and productive stands of 
native herbaceous vegetation (Laughlin et al. 2006), 
they served as the reference community against 
which changes in other patch types were assessed. 
~ Springer 
A 2.5 m radius circular subplot was established 
within each patch type in each treatment plot. in total, 
55 subplots were established (four per treatment plot 
in the thinning treatment (n = 20) and composite 
treatment (n = 20), -and three per treatment plot in the 
control (n = 15, because controls did not contain 
postsettlement removed patches». Subplots represent 
the range of conditions (i.e., open to full canopy) 
sampled within treatment plots. For this study, 
vegetation data were examined at the treatment-level 
(n = 15 plots) and at the patch-level within treated 
areas (n = 40 subplots). 
Complete species lists were collected in two 1 m2 
(0.5 x 2 m) quadrats per circular subplot. For each 
subplot, therefore, species were noted as being 
present on 0, 1, or 2 quadrats. Quadrats were 
arranged in a wagon-wheel configuration around the 
circular subplot center, and were rotated each year to 
avoid harvesting vegetation repeatedly from the same 
area for another study (Moore et a1. 2006). Data were 
collected in September for the following years: 1992 
(pretreatment), 1994 (after thinning, but before the 
first bum), 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2002, 2004, and 
2005. 
Statistical analyses 
Separate analyses were conducted for treatment- and 
patch-level effects. Treatment-level effects were 
analyzed with plots nested within treatments as the 
error term. Patch-level effects were analyzed with a 
model that included treatment, plot nested within 
treatment, patch, and treatment x patch terms; the 
residuals formed the error term for tests of patch and 
treatment x patch effects. For each type of analysis, 
data from 1992 were analyzed to identify pretreat­
ment differences, and data from 1994-2005 were 
analyzed using a repeated measures analysis to 
identify overall differences after treatment. Signifi­
cant posttreatment differences were followed by 
analyses of individual years to identify particular 
years when effects differed. All tests were conducted 
with ct = 0.05. 
The analyses included four components: species 
richness (total and native), community composition, 
net change in composition from 1992 to 2005, and 
Indicator Species Analysis. Total species richness per 
subplot was calculated as the total number of species 

Plant Ecol (2008) 197:139-151 
143 
in the 2 m2 quadrats. Native species richness was 
calculated as the number of species native to North 
America, as defined by USDA NRCS (2006), per 
2 m2 quadrats. Analyses of treatment and patch 
effects on species richness were conducted using 
repeated measures MANOVA with SAS JMP-IN 
software (version 5.1.2 ; SAS 2004). 
We analyzed compositional differences with a 
distance-based permutational multivariate analysis of 
variance (DISTLM; Anderson 2001 ; McArdle and 
Anderson 200 I). This technique is a straightforward 
extension of MANOVA that is applicable to multi­
variate response data; the test statistic is a pseudo-F 
statistic. We used Bray-Curtis dissimilarity as our 
distance measure (Faith et al. 1987), and 9,999 
permutations to calculate the significance of the 
pseudo-F statistic. The net change in composition 
from 1992 to 2005 was assessed by cal culating the 
Bray-Curtis distance measure for each subplot based 
on its composition in these years. This distance 
ranges from 0 (completely identical) to I (completely 
diss imilar). As recommended by McCune and Grace 
(2002), analyses of community composition were 
restricted to species that occurred on at least 5% of 
subplots (out of all 495 subplot-year combinations). 
Indicator Species Analysis (lSA; Dufrene and 
Legendre 1997) was used to identify species associ­
ated with the observed differences among treatments 
and patches. Since we were trying to explain these 
differences, we only conducted ISAs for years, in 
which composition differed among treatments (1998­
2005 ; see Results, below). Further, since the results of 
an ISA depend on how data are grouped (Dufrene and 
Legendre 1997), we used the results of the composi­
tional analysis (see Results, below) to identify the 
comparisons of interest. Two biologically motivated 
comparisons were made among treatments: (I) con­
trol versus treated (a combination of composite and 
thinning treatments) to examine species responses to 
thinning, and (2) composite versus unburned (a 
combination of control and thinning treatments) to 
examine species responses to burning. Patch effects 
were compared between presettlement, postsettlement 
(a combination of retained and removed), and remnant 
grass patches. If a species was an indicator in both 
comparisons for treatment effect, it was identified as 
an indicator of the group in which its Indicator Value 
(IV) was greatest. However, a given species could be 
an indicator of treatment and of patch effects, as these 
effects are not hierarchical. An IV was calculated .. 
independently for each species as the product of its 
relati ve abundance and frequency, and the signifi ­
cance of the calculated IV was assessed using 999 
Monte Carlo randomizations. ISAs were conducted 
using code written for R (v. 2.2.1; code available from 
J.D. Bakker). A separate ISA was conducted for each 
year, and results were combined using meta-analytical 
techniques (Bakker 2005). For a given species in a 
given group, the IVs from every year, that it occurred, 
were averaged to yield a mean IV, and the associ ated 
P-values were combined using a weighted Z-trans­
form (Whitlock 2005). Combining results from 
multiple years reduces the likelihood of spurious 
results (Bakker 2005). We required that significant 
indicators have a mean IV ~25 and combined P­
value < 0.05 (Dufrene and Legendre 1997). 
Results 
Eighty-nine species were detected in the study area 
from 1992 to 2005. Thirty-nine species occurred on at 
least 5% of the subplot-year combinations, and were 
included in analyses of community composition. 
Treatment effects 
Total species richness (per 2 m2) was similar among 
treatments in 1992 before treatment (F 2 •12 = 1.00, 
P = 0.394), but not after treatment (repeated mea­
sures analysis of 1994-2005 data: 
F2•12 =5.19 , 
P = 0.024). Richness remained similar among treat ­
ments until 11 and 12 years after treatment (2004, 
2005), when more species occurred in the composite 
than in control or thinning treatments (Fig. I). 
Similar results were obtained when native species 
richness was analyzed separately (data not shown). 
Species richness was temporally variable (Fig . I). 
Mean species richness within plots was not correlated 
with interannual precipitation (P > 0.05). However, 
the severe drought of 2002 coincided with a notice­
able 
reduction 
in 
species 
richness across 
all 
treatments (Fig. 1). 
Plant community composition was similar among 
treatments in 1992 before treatment, but not after 
treatment (Table 1). Composition first diverged 
among treatments in 1998, 5 years after the overstory

treatments that differ from one another are indicated with 
different lowercase letters; letters are not shown if treatments

sampling in 1994, 1998, and 2002 
was thinned, but were not consistent through time . In 
1998, 1999, 2004, and 2005, composition differed 
between the composite and control treatments, but 
composition in the composite treatment was similar 
to the control during the severe drought of 2002 . In

than the control treatment '(mean 
Bray-Curtis distance =0.36). The thinning treatment 
had a mean Bray-Curtis distance of 0.44, which did 
not differ from either the composite treatment or the 
control. 
No species were indicators of the control treatment 
(Table 2). Two C3 grasses (Elymus elymoides, Fest­
uca arizonica) and two legumes (Astragalus rusbyi, 
Vicia spp.) were indicators of treated plots (combi­
nation of composite and thinned treatments). Lupinus 
argenteus, a legume, and Verbascum thapsus, a 
nonnative forb, were indicators of the burned com­
posite treatment. One 
C4 
grass, Muhlenbergia 
montana, was an indicator of unburned plots (com­
bination of control and thinning treatments). 
Patch effects 
Before treatment, total species richness (per 2 m2) 
was greatest in remnant grass patches and lowest in 
presettlement patches (F3,24 = 121.50, P < 0.001; 
Fig. 2). Following treatment, richness continued to 
differ among patch types (repeated measures analysis 
of 1994-2005 data: F3,24 = 33.70, P < 0.001) but the 
treatment x patch interaction was not significant 
(F3,24 = 0.36, P = 0.785), indicating that patch types 
in the composite and thinning treatments responded 
similarly. Presettlement patches always had the 
lowest richness, and remnant grass patches generally 
had the highest richness, though richness increased in

Fig. 2 Total species richness (+ I standard error) at the 2 m2 
subplot scale (n =40) differed among patch types within 
treated areas at the beginning of the study, but richness in 
postsettlement removed and postsettlement retained patches 
increased to similar levels detected in the remnant grass 
patches over time. Within each year, different letters indicate 
differences among patch types. Analyses of native species 
richness yielded similar results. Overstory thinning occurred in 
1993, and prescribed fires (denoted by vertical lines at top) 
occurred after sampling in 1994, 1998, and 2002 
both types of postsettlement patches. In particular, 
richness was similar between remnant grass and 
postsettlement removed patches in 1996, 1998, 2004, 
and 2005, and between remnant grass and postsettle­
ment retained patches in 1996 and 2005. Similar 
results were obtained when we analyzed native 
species richness exclusively (data not shown). 
Community composition differed among patch 
types prior to treatment. Remnant grass and preset­
tlement patches were distinct from one another and 
from both types of postsettlement patches (Table 3). 
These inter-patch differences persisted after treat­
ment, and did not differ among thinning and 
composite treatments. Interannual differences were 
minimal, though the composition of the postsettle­
ment removed and postsettlement retained patches 
diverged in 2002 and 2005. 
The net change in composition from 1992 to 2005 
differed among patch types (F3.24 = 5.96, P =0.004). 
The magnitude of change was greatest for presettle­
ment patches (mean Bray-Curtis distance = 0.73) and 
lowest for remnant grass patches (mean Bray-Curtis 
distance =0.32). Postsettlement removed and post­
settlement retained patches had intermediate mean 
Bray-Curtis distances (removed: 0.56; retained: 0.44), 
and did not differ from other patch types. The 
treatment x patch interaction was not significant 
(F3,24 = 0.36, P = 0.780).

Increased pine densities and cessation of a frequent­
fire regime are thought to have reduced species 
richness and altered the composition of understory 
plant communities in ponderosa pine forests (Cov­
ington and Moore 1994; Allen et al. 2002). This 
study supports these assumptions, since reducing pine 
densities and applying prescribed fire ' increased 
native species richness and altered

composition. However, these changes may occur 
slowly, and may not be detectable for many years. 
Thus, long-term monitoring is essential when evalu­
ating the success of restoration treatments. 
We expected to observe increases in species 
richness in both thinning and composite treatments. 
Pine trees intercept light (Naumburg and DeWald 
1999) and precipitation (McLaughlin 1978), produce 
abundant needle-fall, and compete for soil nutrients 
near the soil surface. All these mechanisms can 
impact herbaceous productivity and species compo­
sition due to interspecific differences in response to 
resource availability (Riegel et al. 1995). In this 
experiment, thinning alone did not increase species 
richness, whereas thinning plus repeated burning 
increased species richness II years after initial 
treatment (Fig . I). Repeated disturbances, such as 
prescribed fire, likely reduced competitive interac­
tions among dominant species (Huston 1979), and 
created sites for seedling establishment (Grime 
1977), thereby promoting species coexistence at 
small spatial scales. 
While restoration treatments did not result in 
increased richness until more than a decade after 
initial treatment, herbaceous standing crop increased 
rapidly (Moore et al. 2006) . Species richness exhibits 
a quadratic relationship with total standing crop 
within a given year (D.C. Laughlin and M.M. Moore, 
unpublished data), such that species richness is 
maximal at approximately 100 g m­2• The 'hump­
shaped' relationship between richness and standing 
crop suggests that richness is regulated at the higher 
levels of herbaceous production due to competitive 
exclusion and recruitment limitation (Grime 1979; 
Keddy 2005). This suggests that management goals 
of increasing productivity and diversity at relatively 
small scales cannot be achieved simultaneously if 
herbaceous productivity levels are too high . 
We did not directly study colonizing mechanisms , 
that might have led to increased species richness. 
However, 15 species that were present in 2004 and 
2005 were not present at the beginning of the study, 
suggesting that they colonized from the soil seed 
bank or from off-site population sources. Observed 
increases in species richness were not entirely due to 
new colonists, but were 
likely also caused by 
dispersal from 
adjacent remnant grass patches. 
Approximately half of these new colonists were 
annuals, which is consistent with research suggesting 
that reintroducing fire into these systems increases the 
,, ' 
richness and abundance of native annuals (Laughlin 
et al. 2004, 2005, 2006; Fule et al. 2005; Moore et al. 
2006). The exclusion of ungulates from the study area, 
may have hampered dispersal of off-site species 
dependent on epizoochory. 
Long-term experiments allow for comparisons of 
treatments among climatically variable years (Tilman 
1989). The severe drought of 2002 (77% below 
normal precipitation) coincided with reduced species 
richness among all treatments. Water is a major 
limiting resource in semi-arid systems (e.g. Bres­
hears et al. 2005), and the lack of water in 2002 likely 
contributed to the temporary loss of species in the 
community. However, richness began to increase 
again after the severe drought. Interestingly, the 
severe drought apparently nullified the compositional 
differences between the composite and control treat­
ments, yet the thinning treatment remained distinct. 
This further demonstrates the need for long-term 
evaluations of treatment effects in order to under­
stand the background variation caused by interannual 
climatic variability. 
The treatments significantly altered community 
composition after 5 years. Two native cool-season 
grasses, Festuca arizonica and Elymus elymoides, 
were indicators of treated rather than control areas, 
suggesting that thinning the overstory canopy pro­
moted their establishment (Naumburg and DeWald 
1999; Naumburg et al. 2001) . However, a dominant 
warm-season native bunchgrass, Muhlenbergia mon­
tana, was negatively affected by repeated prescribed 
fires that occurred in the fall, which is consistent with 
published reports for M. montana (Gaines et al. 
1958), but counter to the recent hypothesis that 
increased fire frequency is linked to the expansion of 
C4 graminoids (Keeley and Rundel 2005) . This effect 
may relate to the sea son of burn; M. montana would 
likely be favored by burns that occur before it starts 
investing energy in vegetative growth. Vose and 
White (1991) concluded that the net effect of a 
prescribed fire on M. montana was negative due to 
high mortality and low seedling recruitment. Fire­
induced mortality might' be directly due to the 
buildup of dry flammable material at the base of M. 
montana plants (Vose and White 1991). Two nati ve 
leguminous forbs, Vicia spp. 
and the endemic 
Astragalus rusbyi, were also more frequent and 
abundant in both treatments. These species can

increase the rate of nitrogen fixation, a critical 
ecosystem function in this nitrogen-limited ecosys­
tem. Notably, A. rusbyi has been listed as a sensitive 
species by the U.S. Forest Service due to its limited 
range, and its positive response to restoration treat­
ments is encouraging. 
Compositional changes may not be desirable if 
they involve increases in nonnative species. Rela­
tively few nonnative species were present in our 
study area, however, likely because the site has been 
little disturbed for nearly a century (Korb et al. 
2005). Verbascum thapsus, a nonnative biennial, was 
an indicator of the composite treatment, consistent 
with the findings of Korb et al. (2005). Disturbance­
adapted nonnative species can increase after wildfires 
(Crawford et al. 200 I; Griffis et al. 200 I), and 
prescribed fires (Wolfson 2005) in southwestern 
ponderosa pine forests and in other regions (Dodson 
and Fiedler 2006; Keeley 2006). No nonnative 
species were indicators of the thinning treatment. 
Therefore, scheduling longer bum intervals (see also 
Keeley (2006) and Fule and Laughlin (2007)), or 
refraining from burning in thinned forests, especially 
where fuel loads are not considered hazardous, may 
reduce nonnative species establishment. However, 
this option must be weighed against the potential loss 
of frequent fire-dependent species. 
These results illustrate the importance of long­
term monitoring, but care should be taken when 
extrapolating beyond the scale of this study. The 
treatments implemented in 1993 are not operationally 
feasible at landscape scales due to logistical con­
straints, though traditional thinning and burning 
techniques are occurring at landscape scales. Fur­
thermore, this experiment was conducted at a site 
with uniform soils, and response variables were 
analyzed at a single spatial scale. More research is 
needed to assess the generality of these results on 
other soil types and at other spatial scales. 
Patch effects 
Response to restoration treatments differed among 
forest patch types. The remnant grass patches are 
viewed as being the most similar to pre-Euroamer­
ican settlement reference conditions (Laughlin et a!. 
2006), and therefore, served as the target against 
which changes in other patch types were compared. 
Species richness in postsettlement removed and 
postsettlement retained patches increased' to levels ' 
found in remnant grass patches toward the end of the 
study (Fig. 2). Species richness did not increase in 
presettlement tree patches where large trees suppress 
understory vegetation. These results highlight the 
importance of creating sufficiently large gaps in the 
canopy within treatments because a few retained trees 
can have a disproportionately large effect on under­
story responses (Moore and Deiter 1992). 
Postsettlement 
removed 
and 
postsettlement 
retained patches were disturbed by harvesting activ­
ities and by prescribed fires in the composite 
treatment. Composition of these patches remained 
distinct from that of the remnant grass patches 
(Table 3), suggesting that removing some or all of 
the small diameter trees, and applying prescribed fire, 
were not enough to restore community composition 
in this time frame. Elymus elymoides, the only 
indicator of postsettlement patches, colonizes dis­
turbed sites rapidly (Jones 1998), likely due to its 
highly mobile wind-dispersed caryopses, and high 
germination rates. E. elymoides may be an important 
facilitator of postfire vegetation dynamics. 
While most indicators of remnant grass patches 
(Table 4) were already abundant in these patches in 
1992 and maintained their abundance through 2005 , 
two species (Astragalus rusbyi and Poa jendleriana) 
increased in frequency and abundance from 1992 to 
2005 . However, no indicators of remnant grass 
patches have become very abundant in the postset­
tlement removed and postsettlement retained patches. 
Further research is needed to determine whether these 
species are dispersal or microsite limited, and the 
degree to which competition with neighboring veg­
etation 
affects 
their 
spread. 
Diversity 
and 
composition of postsettlement removed and retained 
patches might be enhanced by outplanting nursery­
grown plugs or by seeding native species (Springer 
and Laughlin 2004), though seeding in semi-arid 
forests is often not very successful. 
Conclusion 
Restoring the composition of a plant community is a 
difficult task compared to restoring ecological struc­
ture or function (Lockwood and Pimm 1999). The 
results 
from this study suggest that restoration

treatments can significantly increase species richness, 
and alter understory plant community composition in 
a 
pine-bunchgrass 
ecosystem. 
However, 
these 
changes may not be detectable for many years, and 
can vary temporally in response to events such as 
severe droughts. Thus, the value of long-term studies 
increases with each year of monitoring. Though 
diversity increased in patches where small trees were 
removed, composition continued to di ffer among 
remnant grass patches and other patch types, sug­
gesting that composition changes slowly in this 
system. While nonnative species were minimal in 
the study area, one such species was abundant where 
prescribed fires occurred. Scheduling longer intervals 
between prescribed bums or refraining from burning 
in thinned forests, especially where fuel loads are not 
hazardous, may reduce invasion by nonnative spe­
cies, but may hinder goals of increasing diversity. In 
the ponderosa pine-bunchgrass ecosystems of the 
southwestern United States, land managers may 
expect rapid responses in herbaceous understory 
production following treatment, but should not expect 
rapid responses in diversity and composition.
