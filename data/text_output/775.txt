There is a need to quantitatively describe forest types and their associated natural ﬁre regimes in the
western US to understand their variability and to develop strategies to restore ﬁre dependent landscapes
to reduce ecological problems that might ensue from forest structure and ﬁre regime generalizations. We
established three study sites in warm/dry mixed conifer across a west–east transect in southwestern Col-
orado to determine variability in the historical ﬁre regime and ﬁre–climate relationships and to quantify
how diverse warm/dry mixed conifer forest composition and structure are along the same west–east
transect. At each study site we collected cross-sections from dead ﬁre-scarred trees to reconstruct ﬁre
history and established study plots to characterize forest structure. The three warm/dry mixed conifer
sites exhibited different ﬁre histories. One site was characterized by numerous smaller ﬁres as well as
larger ﬁres that appeared to burn most of the study site with the other two study sites characterized
by relatively infrequent, large ﬁre events. There were more unique ﬁre years at each site than synchro-
nous ﬁre years shared by any sites. Current forest stand structure, after extended ﬁre exclusion and past
logging across the three sites, also varied with a reverse-J distribution indicating strong dominance by
small trees for two of the study sites and a truncated age distribution at the other site. Our research illus-
trates that historical ﬁre regime variability exists within the same vegetation type in a relatively small,
50 km, geographic locality emphasizing the role that other topographic variables play in determining
ﬁre regimes and forest structure. Our ﬁndings demonstrate the need to develop site-speciﬁc reference
conditions and for managers to exercise caution when extrapolating ﬁre regimes and forest structure
from one geographic locality to another given a projected warmer climate making conditions more favor-
able to frequent, large wildﬁres.

1. Introduction
Mixed conifer is one of the most complex forest types in the
western United States. Mixed conifer forests in the American
Southwest (Arizona, New Mexico, and southern Colorado and
Utah) cover approximately 1,000,000 ha (Dieterich, 1983) between
the generally lower elevation ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. &
C. Lawson) and the higher elevation Engelmann spruce (Picea eng-
elmannii Parry ex Engelm.) and subalpine ﬁr [Abies lasiocarpa
(Hook.) Nutt.] forest types. Southwestern mixed conifer forests
have been classiﬁed in two categories, warm/dry and cool/moist,
which denote the ends of a xeric–mesic continuum (Romme
et al., 2009). Warm/dry mixed conifer is generally located at the
lower elevation of the continuum on predominately southerly as-
pects and is dominated by ﬁre resistant ponderosa pine (P. ponder-
osa) and Douglas-ﬁr [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] but also
includes species adapted to mesic conditions such as white ﬁr
[Abies concolor (Gordon and Glendinning) Hoopes.] and aspen (Pop-
ulus tremuloides Michx.) and sometimes southwestern white pine
(Pinus strobiformis Engelm.). Surface ﬁres burned with sub- to mul-
ti-decadal frequency prior to Euro-American settlement (late
1800s) in warm/dry mixed conifer (Grissino-Mayer et al., 2004a;
Fulé et al., 2009). Cool/moist mixed conifer is usually located at
the higher elevation of the continuum on predominately northerly
aspects and is dominated by mesic-adapted conifers and aspen.
Fires in cool/moist mixed conifer forests burned with a sub-deca-
dal to century frequency where surface and crown ﬁre behavior
could occur during the same ﬁre event (Margolis and Balmat,
2009; Romme et al., 2009).
Fire suppression along with grazing in the 20th century, which
disrupted ﬁne fuel continuity, has increased stand density in
warm/dry
mixed
conifer.

shade-intolerant ponderosa pine to shade-tolerant species such as
white ﬁr and Douglas-ﬁr (Mast and Wolf, 2004; Brown and Wu,
2005; Fulé et al., 2009). There has also been increased continuity
of vertical and horizontal fuels (Cocke et al., 2005; Margolis and
Balmat, 2009). As a result of these changes, a current focus for sci-
entists and land managers is to restore forest stand characteristics
that were historically adapted to frequent surface ﬁre but are now
at risk of crown ﬁre (Fulé et al., 2003; Heinlein et al., 2005; Falk,
2006). In adjacent pure ponderosa pine forests there is an abun-
dance of research describing the range of variability in stand struc-
ture and historical ﬁre regimes prior to Euro-American settlement
in the American Southwest (Covington et al., 1997; Fulé et al.,
1997; Swetnam and Baisan, 2003; Grissino-Mayer et al., 2004a;
Moore et al., 2004; Brown and Wu, 2005). A diverse range of scien-
tiﬁcally viable restoration approaches has been proposed to reﬂect
the heterogeneous spatial and temporal forest patterns and ﬁre re-
gimes at local and landscape scales in ponderosa pine in the Inter-
mountain West (Covington et al., 1997; Allen et al., 2002; Iniguez
et al., 2008).
Much less information exists about the range of site-speciﬁc
variability of warm/dry mixed conifer forest composition, structure
and ﬁre regimes prior to Euro-American settlement in the Ameri-
can Southwest, particularly in southwest Colorado (Grissino-
Mayer et al., 2004a; Korb et al., 2007; Fulé et al., 2009). Given
the extensive coverage of warm/dry mixed conifer in this region,
these previous studies may not provide an accurate description
of variability in warm/dry mixed conifer making additional re-
search valuable. Grissino-Mayer and others (2004a) reconstructed
ﬁre regimes in ponderosa pine forests across an elevation gradient
in southwest Colorado and found mean ﬁre intervals lengthened
with increased elevation with low elevation ponderosa pine sites
having 6–10 year mean ﬁre return intervals (MFIs) and higher ele-
vation warm/dry mixed conifer sites having longer MFIs of 18–
20 years. Beginning in 2002, we initiated a study within the same
region to determine reference conditions of historical ﬁre regime
and ﬁre–climate relationships, forest composition, and forest
structure for warm/dry mixed conifer at Lower Middle Mountain
in southwest Colorado and found mean ﬁre intervals of 24–
36 years prior to 1870 (Fulé et al., 2009). We quantiﬁed how these
variables changed since 1870 and designed and tested three resto-
ration alternatives (thin/burn, burn only, and untreated controls)
on four replicated blocks, each approximately 16 ha (Korb et al.,
2007; Korb and Fulé, 2008; Fulé et al., 2009). The present study ex-
pands upon the Lower Middle Mountain experiment to determine
(a) how representative the restoration treatment ﬁndings are for
the surrounding warm/dry mixed conifer on the San Juan National
Forest, and (b) if site-speciﬁc information to guide the develop-
ment of ecological restoration prescription treatments by land
managers is required for warm/dry mixed conifer in southwest
Colorado.
There is a need to quantitatively describe forest types and their
associated natural ﬁre regimes in the western US to understand
their variability and to develop strategies to restore ﬁre dependent
landscapes to reduce ecological problems that might ensue from
forest structure and ﬁre regime generalizations and to evaluate
the impacts of recent large wildﬁres on forest structure (Schoenna-
gel et al., 2004; Beaty and Taylor, 2008). This is especially impor-
tant because warmer temperatures (ICPP, 2007) have increased
ﬁre season length thus amplifying the number of large ﬁres in
the western US (Westerling et al., 2006; Littell et al., 2009). To ad-
dress this need we established a west–east transect of three study
sites, including Lower Middle Mountain, at similar latitude (37N)
and elevation range (2350 to 2750 m) to quantify warm/dry
mixed conifer forest composition, structure and ﬁre regime vari-
ability. We hypothesized that ﬁre–climate relationships would be
similar with climate synchronizing ﬁre occurrence across the three
study sites and there would be little variability in forest composi-
tion, structure and ﬁre regime among our study sites because of
relatively similar latitude and elevation. The main purpose of this
paper is to address the following questions: (1) how variable was
the historical ﬁre regime and ﬁre–climate relationships in warm/
dry mixed conifer across a west-east transect at relatively similar
latitude and elevation over 50 km on the San Juan National For-
est? and (2) how diverse is warm/dry mixed conifer forest compo-
sition and structure along the same west–east transect?
2. Methods
2.1. Study area
The study area is located in the San Juan Mountains, San Juan
National Forest, in southwestern Colorado. Our three study sites,
Grassy Mountain, Lower Middle Mountain, and Jackson Mountain
represent a west–east transect of warm/dry mixed conifer stands
on the San Juan National Forest at similar latitude (37N) and ele-
vation range (2350 to 2750 m) covering a distance of 50 km
(Fig. 1). Warm/dry mixed conifer forests occupy 50,525 ha of the
San Juan National Forest. Dominant tree species include ponderosa
pine, Douglas-ﬁr, white ﬁr and aspen at all three sites. The midsto-
ry and understory for all sites were dominated primarily by Doug-
las-ﬁr and white ﬁr and a variety of shrubs including Gambel oak
(Quercus gambelii), snowberry (Symphoricarpus rotundifolius), and
serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia). Past disturbance history for
all sites include sheep and cattle grazing and timber harvesting
since the late 1800s with ﬁre suppression as the management pol-
icy since the early twentieth century. The Grassy Mountain and
Lower Middle Mountain study sites are generally south-facing with
16–20% average slopes. Jackson Mountain is generally east-facing
with a 19% slope average. Daily temperatures range from an aver-
age maximum of 27.1 C in July to a minimum of 14.5 C in Jan-
uary at Grassy Mountain. The greatest amounts of precipitation
occur in July and August due to summer thunderstorm activity
with precipitation from November to March dominated by snow-
fall with an average annual snow total of 293 cm (Western Regio-
nal Climate Center, Vallecito Dam, 1917–2010, www.wrcc.dri.edu).
The Lower Middle and Jackson Mountain study sites have average
daily temperatures range from a maximum of 25.7 C in July to a
minimum of 17 C in January with similar precipitation patterns
at Grassy Mountain and an average annual snowfall total of 326 cm
(Western Regional Climate Center, Pagosa Springs, 1906–1998,
www.wrcc.dri.edu).
2.2. Field methods
This study utilized ﬁre history legacy data collected by the For-
est Service at three different mixed conifer sites. For each collec-
tion, ﬁre scarred samples were collected from dead wood (logs,
stumps, and snags) specimens. No live trees were sampled due to
local Forest policy. The lack of live samples was not problematic
as dead wood samples were able to provide coverage into the
20th century. The Jackson Mountain ﬁre history was collected in
1997 (Wu, 1999) adjacent to the west end of the forest structure
plots. The Jackson Mountain search area was approximately
190 ha. No signiﬁcant natural barriers exist between the ﬁre his-
tory collection area and forest structure plots; therefore, we felt
we could reasonably apply the ﬁre history to the forest structure
plots established in this study. The Lower Middle Mountain and
Grassy Mountain ﬁre history collections were gathered by the For-
est Service in 1999 and 2006 respectively, for environmental anal-
yses in association with planned fuels projects. Fire history
collection areas and forest structure plots had complete overlap

at Grassy and Lower Middle Mountain. The ﬁre scar search area at
Grassy Mountain was approximately 190 ha and 180 ha at Lower
Middle Mountain.
There were 25 forest structure plots per study site that were
used to characterize forest structure and vegetation (total N = 3
sites  25 plots = 75 plots). In 2003 we permanently marked and
geo-referenced 240 forest structure plots at Lower Middle Moun-
tain on a 60 m grid; we randomly chose 25 of these plots on
300 m grid to include in this study. In 2006 we permanently
marked and geo-referenced 25 forest structure plots on a 300 m
systematic grid at the Grassy and Jackson Mountain study sites.
We measured overstory trees and saplings taller than breast height
(137 cm) in a 400 m2 (11.28 m radius) circular forest structure plot
at Lower Middle Mountain and a variable-radius forest structure
plot delineated using a prism with a basal area factor of 2.2 m2/
hectare per tree at Grassy and Jackson Mountain. We double sam-
pled a random selection of forest structure plots to quantify if var-
iation between ﬁxed and variable-radius forest structure plots had
an effect on forest structure data; no statistical differences were
found. At all study sites, species, condition (living or snag/log clas-
ses Thomas et al., 1979), diameter at breast height (dbh), and a pre-
liminary ﬁeld classiﬁcation of presettlement or postsettlement
origin were recorded for each tree encountered in the forest struc-
ture plot. We identiﬁed potentially presettlement ponderosa pine
trees based on size (>40 cm diameter at ‘‘stump height’’ [dsh]),
40 cm above ground level) or yellow bark (White, 1985). Other
conifers were also considered as potentially presettlement if
dsh > 40 cm; aspen were noted as potentially presettlement if
dsh > 20 cm. All potentially presettlement trees were cored, as well
as the ﬁrst ﬁve living trees encountered clockwise from north on
the forest structure plot.
2.3. Laboratory, statistical, and modeling analysis
2.3.1. Fire history lab methods
Standard dendrochronological methods were used to prepare
and visually crossdate all samples against a master chronology
developed in the San Juan Mountains (Stokes and Smiley, 1968).
Seasonality was assigned to ﬁre years based on the position of
the scar within the tree-ring when possible. The position of a scar
within an annual tree-ring has been locally correlated to time of
year (Grissino-Mayer, 2001). Scars identiﬁed in the early (EE) and
middle earlywood (ME) correspond with early to mid-summers
(mid-June to mid-July). Scars in the late earlywood (LE) and late-
wood (A) correspond to late summer (mid-July to August). Scars
in the dormant (D) position correspond to either the late sum-
mer/fall of the ring that precedes it or the spring of the ring that
follows it. In this study we assign D scars to the spring of the fol-
lowing annual ring.
2.3.2. Fire history descriptive and test statistics
Fire frequency, severity, and seasonality, were used to charac-
terize the ﬁre regime at each site. We selected 1650–1880 for the
designated analysis window. The year 1650 captures the ﬁrst ﬁre
recorded at all sites and 1880 is the locally accepted date of the on-
set of ﬁre exclusion. We used the program SSIZ (Holmes, 1995; Ini-
guez et al., 2008) to assess the analysis period dates. SSIZ uses a
Monte Carlo approach to calculate estimates of mean numbers of
ﬁres and surrounding conﬁdence intervals for randomly selected
subsets of ﬁre-scarred tree samples, permitting comparisons
among our three sites that differed in sample size. The SSIZ analy-
sis showed that all three sites were statistically indistinguishable
and were asymptotic in terms of mean number of ﬁre events per
century versus number of sample trees when analyses were calcu-
lated based on a minimum of two scarred samples per ﬁre event.
Therefore, we used the full data set for calculating ﬁre regime sta-
tistics and we set a minimum of samples per ﬁre event. The MFI,
Weibull Median Probability Interval (WMPI) and ﬁre interval
ranges describe ﬁre frequency at the 10% and 25%-scarred levels.
All statistical analyses used ﬁres that scarred a minimum of two
samples and met the 10%-scarred ﬁlter level. This was done to min-
imize the inclusion of any false ﬁre scars, it could also remove
small ﬁres from the analysis. Percent-scarred levels were used to
describe relative ﬁre size within a site (Swetnam and Baisan,
2003). Smaller ﬁres are included in the 10%-scarred level but are
ﬁltered out by the 25%-scarred level which represents larger ﬁres.
Past ﬁre severity was challenging to describe. The presence of
old, ﬁre-scarred trees and dominance of ponderosa pine and Doug-
las-ﬁr, the most surface-ﬁre adapted species in our study area, pro-
vided evidence of substantial past surface ﬁre. The presence of

other less ﬁre-adapted conifers (white ﬁr and Engelmann spruce)
suggested periods or patches of reduced ﬁre frequency and in-
creased stand density along with the development of horizontal
and vertical fuel continuity that could support high intensity ﬁre
such as crown ﬁre. The presence of aspen is interpreted as evidence
of ﬁre which was at least hot enough to stimulate aspen regenera-
tion through suckering, although it is not necessarily correlated
with high intensity ﬁre as aspen suckering can also respond to
other forest opening opportunities. Age data are important for
evaluating past ﬁre severity, but past tree harvesting limited our
ability to understand the historic age distribution. In many studies
in harvested forests, past forest structure and sometimes past age
distributions have been reconstructed through dendrochronologi-
cal sampling (e.g., Mast et al., 1999), but we did not have sufﬁcient
resources to do that in the present study.
To determine whether ﬁre occurrence differed between sites,
we ran pair-wise statistical tests to compare ﬁre frequency and ﬁre
synchrony. MFIs were compared with Student’s t-tests. Normality
for each ﬁre interval data set was determined and the date trans-
formed prior to running the test (FHX2, Grissino-Mayer, 2001).
To determine whether shared ﬁre years were not due to random
chance, ﬁre synchrony was tested using a 2  2 contingency anal-
ysis (chi-squared test). This analysis tested the null hypothesis
(H22) that the number of shared ﬁre years between sites is not
higher than that expected if ﬁres years were independent occur-
rences. Rejecting H22 suggests that some underlying mechanism
synchronized ﬁres between the two sites. To test any relationship
between common and unique ﬁre years, a 2  1 contingency anal-
ysis was conducted. This analysis tested the null hypothesis (H21)
that ﬁres are independent occurrences at each site. Rejecting H21
indicates that the number of synchronous ﬁres exceeds the num-
ber of asynchronous ﬁres whereas not rejecting H21 indicates
there is no association between ﬁre occurrences between sites.
2.3.3. Fire climate analysis
Short term ﬁre–climate relationships were analyzed with
superposed epoch analyses (SEA) (Swetnam, 1993; Grissino-
Mayer, 1996) on ﬁre years that met the two scar minimum and
10%-scarred level ﬁlter. Fire years were tested against three cli-
mate reconstructions: two drought indices and one ENSO (El
Niño Southern Oscillation) index. Drought indices included the
PDSI (Palmer Drought Severity Index) for the Four Corners (Cook
et al., 2004) and an annual precipitation reconstruction from
northern New Mexico (PPT, Grissino-Mayer et al., 2004b). The
one ENSO index used was the NINO3 sea surface temperature
(SST) index (Cook, 2000). El Niño Southern Oscillation has been
linked to the wet-dry climate pattern found to precede large ﬁre
years in ponderosa pine forests of the Southwest (Swetnam and
Baisan, 1996; Grissino-Mayer et al., 2004a; Brown and Wu,
2005). Superposed epoch analysis compares mean climate values
of the documented ﬁre events and selected analysis window to
bootstrapped conﬁdence intervals to identify important climate
patterns and trends that affect ﬁre occurrence. We used an analysis
window of 10 yrs: 5 pre-ﬁre years, ﬁre year, four post-ﬁre years.
2.4. Forest structure and composition analysis
We compared forest structural variables including tree density
and basal area for individual species among the three study sites
with a Kruskal–Wallis test (P 6 0.05). Post Hoc tests were con-
ducted with pairwise Kruskal–Wallis two-sample tests following
a statistically signiﬁcant result (Mann–Whitney U statistic) and
then adjusted alpha levels by the number of pairwise comparisons
using a Bonferroni correction (Kuehl, 1994). Nonmetric multidi-
mensional scaling (NMS) was used to examine differences in
trees ha1 for all tree species among the three study sites (Clark,
1993). We conducted NMS analyses using PC-ORD software (ver-
sion 5.10, McCune and Mefford, 2006). We ran the NMS ordination
using a Bray-Curtis distance measure, random starting conﬁgura-
tions, 50 runs with real data, a maximum of 200 iterations per
run and a stability criterion of 0.00001. We compared the stress va-
lue of the ﬁnal solution to 50 random solutions using a Monte Carlo
test. Two species, pinon pine (Pinus edulis Engelm.) and Rocky
Mountain juniper (Juniperus scopulorum Sargent) were ﬁltered
out because these species did not occur on a 5% minimum of plots
(McCune and Grace, 2002). We determined the relationships be-
tween tree species and ordination axes using the main matrix Pear-
son’s r correlations; tree species with the highest correlation
coefﬁcients to have the strongest weight on the axes (McCune
and Grace, 2002).
Differences in community forest stand structure, stand density
and stand basal area, among the three study sites were determined
using a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMA-
NOVA) (Anderson, 2001; McArdle and Anderson, 2001). PERMA-
NOVA uses common ecological distance measures (Bray-Curtis
for this study) to examine multivariate data sets and calculates
P-values using permutations rather than tabled P-values that as-
sume normality. We used a one ﬁxed factor design with site as
our main effect (PC-ORD software version 5.10, McCune and Mef-
ford, 2006). We analyzed species that were present in a minimum
of 5% of the plots as recommended by McCune and Grace (2002).
Indicator-species analysis (McCune and Grace, 2002), which uses
species richness and associated abundance values of species, was
used to identify species that were particularly faithful (i.e., consis-
tent indicators) for a particular study site along our west–east tran-
sect in warm, dry mixed conifer. A comparison between the
maximum indicator value (0–100) and random trials for occur-
rence of a given species (1000 Monte Carlo randomizations) pro-
vided an approximate P-value (McCune and Grace, 2002). Species
with P 6 0.05 and indicator values (INDVAL) > 25 (INDVAL = rela-
tive abundance  relative frequency; INDVAL ranges from 0 to
100) were accepted as indicator species for a particular study site
(Dufrêne and Legendre, 1997).
3. Results
3.1. Fire regime descriptive statistics
3.1.1. Seasonality
We were able to assign seasonality positions to 79% of individ-
ual scars found in tree rings. Overall, 63% of individual scars in tree
rings were in the DEM (dormant-early-middle) positions and 16%
were found in LA (late) ring positions. Each site exhibited the same
pattern with a great majority of ﬁres occurring from spring to mid-
summer and a small minority occurring in late summer to fall.
3.1.2. Fire frequency and severity
MFIs between sites were found to be different. Grassy Mountain
burned the most frequently with a sub-decadal MFI of 9 yrs at the
10% -scarred level (Table 1). Jackson and Lower Middle Mountain
burned less often. Both had multi-decadal MFIs of 20 and 30 yrs
respectively. Student’s t-test results at the 10%-scarred level
showed that Grassy Mountain MFIs were signiﬁcantly shorter than
MFIs at Jackson and Lower Middle Mountain (p < 0.01), but MFIs
between
the
latter
sites
were
not
statistically
different
(p = 0.075). MFIs changed very little between the 10% and 25%-
scarred levels, increasing only 1–4 years at Grassy and Jackson
Mountain respectively and remaining unchanged at Lower Middle
Mountain and the same pattern of statistical results was found at
the 25%-scarred level.

The ﬁre history, forest age distribution, and tree species compo-
sition found at the study sites revealed a complex pattern of ﬁre re-
gime and forest dynamics. Two sites, Grassy and Lower Middle
Mountain, display a moderately long, continuous reverse-J age
structure while Jackson Mountain has a truncated age structure
(Fig. 3). Grassy and Lower Middle Mountain’s similarity in age
structure pattern is notable given that their MFIs were different.
Ponderosa pine dominates the early portion of the age structure
at both sites, when ﬁres burned frequently, although less so at
Lower Middle Mountain. After the last ﬁre at each site, 1878 at
Grassy Mountain and 1861 at Lower Middle Mountain, Douglas-
ﬁr and white ﬁr survival increased in association with a lack of ﬁre.
Aspen was also present at both sites, but its establishment pattern
was not always closely tied to ﬁre occurrence.
Unlike the other two sites, Jackson Mountain’s truncated age
structure provides some evidence of a relatively severe ﬁre event
in the mid-1800s, perhaps during the major ﬁre year of 1847
(Fig. 2). Prior to 1847, Jackson Mountain experienced an unusually
long 61 year ﬁre free interval. During that time, survival of Doug-
las-ﬁr and white ﬁr could have increased causing increased forest
density and providing the fuel load and structure for a high sever-
ity and likely high intensity ﬁre event. Three large ﬁres 1851, 1861,
and 1873, burned after 1847. A notable pulse of aspen establish-
ment, making up more than half of the oldest trees found at the
site, appeared after the 1850s (Fig. 2), indicating that one or more
of the mid-nineteenth century ﬁres may have been relatively se-
vere. Old trees (pre-1850s) were very rare at Jackson Mountain.
The truncated age structure could be related to mortality from se-
vere ﬁre but this cannot be distinguished from past tree cutting.
After the last major ﬁre at Jackson Mountain in 1873, tree estab-
lishment became dominated by other conifers and ponderosa pine
and aspen establishment decreased dramatically.
3.1.3. Fire synchrony and ﬁre climate relationships
In general, there were more unique ﬁre years at each site than
synchronous ﬁre years shared by either two or all three sites. Of
the 32 ﬁre years documented, 1861 was the only ﬁre year in com-
mon across all three sites and 11 other ﬁre years were shared by
two of the three sites (Table 2). Grassy Mountain had 14 unique
ﬁre years, Jackson Mountain had three, and Lower Middle Moun-
tain had two. H22 was rejected in all pairings among all three sites
at the 10%-scarred levels (P < 0.005), suggesting synchronous ﬁre
years are related. Other local and regional studies (Grissino-Mayer
et al., 2004a; Brown and Wu, 2005) postulate similar top down
controls where regional climate is responsible for synchronizing
ﬁre years across the landscape. In contrast, H2x1 was not rejected
for any of the pairings at the 10%-scarred level indicating that ﬁre
years between any two sites are independent events and other fac-
tors besides regional climate such as topographic features that pre-
vent ﬁre spread or create unique microclimate are responsible for
the independent occurrence of ﬁre years.
Although local site conditions exert inﬂuence on ﬁre occurrence
at each site, climate plays a strong role in ﬁre occurrence as well.
Superposed epoch analysis (SEA) showed drier than average condi-
tions, indices values exceeding 95% conﬁdence limits, for all cli-
mate indices during the ﬁre year for all three sites (Fig. 4). SEA
also documented a pattern of wetter than average conditions 1–
3 years preceding the ﬁre year at Grassy and Jackson Mountain
and drier than average conditions 1–2 years preceding the ﬁre year
at Lower Middle Mountain. However, index values exceeding the
95% conﬁdence limits in years preceding ﬁre were only found at
Grassy Mountain for the PDSI and NINO3 indices.
Unusually long ﬁre-free ﬁre periods predating 1880 were ob-
served in the Lower Middle and Jackson Mountain chronologies
(Fig. 2). Lower Middle Mountain’s ﬁre-free period occurred from
1685 to 1735 (50 years) and Jackson Mountain’s from 1786 to
1847 (61 years). These ﬁre-free periods were identiﬁed as signiﬁ-
cantly long because they fell at or above the upper Weibull proba-
bility level (95%) in each data set. The ﬁre-free periods did not line
up in this study, but the ﬁre free period at Lower Middle Mountain
did match a ﬁre-free period documented by a study at nearby Arc-
huleta Mesa (Brown and Wu, 2005). Because the ﬁre-free periods
between Lower Middle and Jackson Mountain did not match up,
our ﬁndings suggest that local site factors overrode regional cli-
mate patterns. The only synchronous ﬁre free period found at all
three sites is the current ﬁre-free interval which began with the
last ﬁre at each site and extends to the present day. This current
ﬁre free period is longer than any historical ﬁre-free interval. The
last ﬁre at Grassy Mountain, Lower Middle Mountain, and Jackson
Mountain occurred in 1878, 1861, and 1873 respectively. The cur-
rent ﬁre free period at each site is over 100 years and exceeds the
longest pre-1880 ﬁre free periods by 200–300%.
3.2. Forest structure
All three study sites had a true mixture of species consisting of
ponderosa pine, a xeric species, and various mesic conifers and as-
pen. There was a signiﬁcant difference among the three study sites
for tree density based on community data (F = 5.45; P = 0.0002). All
pairwise comparisons were signiﬁcant; Grassy Mountain had sig-
niﬁcantly lower stand density than Lower Middle Mountain
(P = 0.0002) and Jackson Mountain (P = 0.037). Jackson Mountain
had signiﬁcantly higher stand density than Lower Middle Moun-
tain (P = 0.002). There was no signiﬁcant difference in tree basal
area for community data among the three study sites (F = 1.34;
P = 0.23). Douglas-ﬁr basal area was signiﬁcantly higher (P = 0.02)
at Jackson Mountain than the other two study sites with no signif-
icant difference in basal area for other individual species (Table 4).
White ﬁr comprised the highest proportion of basal area at Grassy
(39.3%) and Jackson Mountain (36.3%) and ponderosa pine made-
up the largest proportion of basal area at Lower Middle Mountain
(36.5%). White ﬁr comprised the main proportion of stand density
at Lower Middle (57.9%) and Jackson Mountain (54.1%) and aspen
represented the largest proportion of stand density at Grassy
(45.3%). White ﬁr tree density was signiﬁcantly higher at Lower
Middle Mountain than Jackson (P = 0.04) or Grassy Mountain
(P = 0.003). In contrast, aspen density was signiﬁcantly higher at
Grassy Mountain than Jackson (P = 0.004) or Lower Middle Moun-
tain (P = 0.01) (Table 3). Douglas-ﬁr tree density was the highest at
Jackson Mountain in comparison to Lower Middle (P = 0.03) or
Grassy Mountain (P = 0.001) (Table 3).
Tree age distribution varied among the three study sites (Fig. 3).
Grassy and Lower Middle Mountain had a reverse-J distribution
indicating strong dominance by small trees and Jackson Mountain
had a truncated age distribution (Fig. 3). There was a small pulse of

ponderosa pine tree establishment in the early 1900s at Grassy and
Jackson Mountain (Fig. 3). Aspen dominated tree establishment at
Grassy Mountain after 1870, while white ﬁr dominated tree estab-
lishment at Lower Middle Mountain and Douglas-ﬁr dominated
tree establishment at Jackson Mountain after 1870 (Fig. 3).
Multivariate comparison of species composition weighted by
tree density showed strong separation between Grassy and Lower
Middle Mountain with Jackson Mountain more strongly associated
with Lower Middle Mountain but overlapping with Grassy Moun-
tain (Fig. 5). Variation along Axis 1 was the result of differences
in white ﬁr trees ha1 among study sites and variation along Axis
2 was associated with Douglas-ﬁr basal area/ha variability among
study sites (Fig. 5). Indicator species analysis detected species that
were particularly consistent indicators for two of our study sites
(Table 4). Grassy Mountain had no species that were particularly
faithful (Table 4). White ﬁr was the only indicator species for Low-
er Middle Mountain (IV = 52.9, P = 0.0006) and Douglas-ﬁr was the
only indicator species for Jackson Mountain (IV = 35.7, P = 0.033)
(Table 4).
4. Discussion
4.1. Fire regime and ﬁre–climate relationships
4.1.1. Fire regime
The warm/dry mixed conifer ﬁre regime was more variable than
that of nearby pure ponderosa pine forests having a dry to moist
continuum within warm/dry mixed conifer forests (Grissino-
Mayer et al., 2004a). Sub-decadal ﬁre frequency prevailed at Grassy
Mountain representing the drier spectrum of the warm/dry mixed
conifer ﬁre regime. In contrast, multi-decadal ﬁre frequency, long
ﬁre-free periods and possibly locally severe ﬁre prior to 1880 asso-
ciated with high aspen establishment was observed at Jackson
Mountain and Lower Middle Mountain indicative of the moister
spectrum of the warm/dry mixed conifer ﬁre regime.
Surface ﬁre was common to all three study sites supporting the
classiﬁcation of all three study sites as warm/dry mixed conifer.
Grassy Mountain’s MFIs were very similar to pure ponderosa pine
in the American Southwest (Grissino-Mayer et al., 2004a; Brown
and Wu, 2005), but its moister environment allowed denser stand
structure than pure ponderosa pine. Patches of high severity burn-
ing could have occurred, particularly after the longer ﬁre-free
intervals of 17–23 years (Table 1) due to the increased forest den-
sity and fuel structure. In contrast, Jackson and Lower Middle
Mountain had longer MFIs and currently denser stand structures
than Grassy Mountain. Their ﬁre interval ranges and MFIs are com-
parable with other warm/dry mixed conifer forests in the region
(Santa Fe, New Mexico, Margolis and Balmat, 2009). Other studies
in warm/dry mixed conifer reported MFIs much shorter than Low-
er Middle and Jackson Mountain and more similar to those found
at Grassy Mountain (Fulé et al., 2003; Grissino-Mayer et al.,
2004a), underscoring the relatively high variability and presence
of a dry to moist continuum within warm/dry mixed conifer for-
ests. The majority of ﬁres recorded in our reconstructed chronolo-
gies burned moderate to large areas for all three study sites as
illustrated by MFIs remaining consistent or with little change

(center), and Jackson Mountain (top). Tree establishment was dominated by
ponderosa pine prior to 1870, although aspen and other conifers were all present.

between the 10% and 25%-scarred ﬁlter levels. Very small ﬁres did
burn at all three study sites, most notably at Grassy Mountain, but
these ﬁres were not analyzed because the two scar minimum
and%-scarred ﬁlters removed them our analysis.
4.1.2. Fire synchrony and ﬁre–climate relationships
Regional climate can synchronize ﬁre years across large areas
whereas site-speciﬁc factors exert more control over local areas
(Brown et al., 2001; Heyerdahl et al., 2001). Fires occurred in years
of drier than average conditions for all three study sites. One to
three wetter than average years proceeded the ﬁre year at Grassy
and Jackson Mountain. In contrast, the ﬁre year was preceded by
1–2 years of drier than average conditions at Lower Middle Moun-
tain (Fig. 4). The pattern at Grassy Mountain is expected because
Grassy Mountain’s MFIs were similar to pure ponderosa pine ﬁre
histories in the region (Swetnam and Baisan, 1996; Grissino-Mayer
et al., 2004a; Brown and Wu, 2005) with one to several wet years
before a large ﬁre year aiding in creating a continuous fuel bed
through increased herbaceous cover. We did not expect to ﬁnd this
same climate pattern at wetter sites that are considered not to be
limited by herbaceous fuels. Such forests are often signiﬁcantly dry
in the ﬁre year but are less likely to have an association with sig-
niﬁcantly wet conditions in prior years (Swetnam and Baisan,
1996).
Fig. 4. Superposed epoch analysis (SEA) results for each site. Analysis was performed on ﬁres that met the two scar minimum and 10% ﬁlter within the analysis window
(1650–1880). Fire years were run against three different climate reconstructions and two drought indices: (1) PDSI for the Four Corners (Cook et al., 2004); (2) annual
precipitation reconstruction from northern New Mexico (PPT, Grissino-Mayer et al., 2004a); and, (3) NINO3 sea surface temperature (SST) index (Cook, 2000). Year 0 is the
average climate anomaly for the ﬁre year. Negative lag years are the years prior to the ﬁre year. Black bars mark departures that exceed 95% conﬁdence limits at a minimum.

The fact that we observed more unique ﬁre years among our
study sites than synchronous ones highlights the strong inﬂuence
local site conditions such as moisture, stand structure, fuel accu-
mulation, topography, and microclimates have on local ﬁre occur-
rence. Variables linked to topographic differences that inﬂuence
site moisture conditions would explain some of the differences in
ﬁre occurrence among our sites. Southerly aspects receive more so-
lar heating than other aspects making fuels drier. Multiple aspects,
fragmented fuel conditions, and complicated topography that har-
bors moist conditions on northerly aspects and in deep drainages
can impede ﬁre spread (Iniguez et al., 2009). Iniguez and others
(2008) documented higher ﬁre frequencies and more widespread
ﬁres on simpler landscapes lacking deep drainages, cliffs, or other
ﬁre spread barriers, which is similar to our Grassy Mountain site.
In contrast, complicated landscapes, which are steep and dissected
by deep drainages or multiple aspects exhibited longer ﬁre inter-
vals and fewer widespread ﬁres as a whole, which is similar to
our Jackson and Lower Middle Mountain sites (Iniguez et al., 2008).
Unusually long ﬁre free periods within the ﬁre chronologies at
our three study sites are likely driven by long term ﬁre–climate
relationships. Similar ﬁre-free periods have been documented lo-
cally and across the region in Arizona and New Mexico (Swetnam
and Baisan, 1996; Wu, 1999; Brown and Wu, 2005; Fulé et al.,
2009). Explanations for unusually long ﬁre free periods prior to
Euro-American settlement (late 1800s) include dampened ENSO
amplitude or a cool phase in the Paciﬁc Decadal Oscillation
(PDO) that enhances precipitation in the southwestern United
States (Grissino-Mayer et al., 2004a; Brown and Wu, 2005). These
ﬁre free periods in our study do not line up, illustrating the com-
plexity of understanding long term ﬁre–climate relationships and
the need for additional data collection and analysis to understand
exactly how climate mechanisms are driving the occurrence of
long ﬁre free periods. In contrast, the current ﬁre free interval at
each of our study sites that began in the 1870s is much longer than
the long ﬁre free periods prior to Euro-American settlement
(Fig. 2). The fact that warm/dry mixed conifer forests on the San
Juan National Forest are outside their historic range of variability
for ﬁre recurrence is linked to evidence that the present forest
structure has been pushed outside its historic range as well (Fulé
et al., 2009). These forests have had an extended period of time
to increase in density and past harvesting preferentially removed
ﬁre-resistant pines while fostering regeneration of mesic, shade-
tolerant conifers (Fulé et al., 2009). The relatively homogenous
and heavy fuel complexes at Jackson and Middle Mountain can
support larger high-severity ﬁres under hot and dry conditions.
Such conditions are likely to become more common as climate
models have predicted arid regions of southwestern North America
to shift to warmer, drier conditions in the 21st century (Seager
et al., 2007; Seager and Vecchi, 2010).
4.2. Forest structure
There was an inconsistent relationship between tree age distri-
butions and ﬁre scar chronologies at our three study sites where
ﬁre scar chronologies represent the occurrence of ﬁre frequency
and tree age distributions signify a proxy for the ecological role
of ﬁre. For example, tree age distributions were most similar be-
tween Grassy and Lower Middle Mountain (Fig. 3) even though
these sites had the highest and lowest ﬁre frequencies (Table 1
and Fig. 2). Similarly, ﬁre scar chronologies were more similar at
Lower Middle and Jackson Mountain (Table 1 and Fig. 2) but their
tree age distributions were distinct with Lower Middle Mountain
having numerous old trees and Jackson Mountain having a trun-
cated age distribution with a lack of trees established before the
early 1800s (Fig. 3). Without being able to distinguish between
the losses of old trees due to locally severe ﬁre, versus harvesting,
there is insufﬁcient evidence to describe the relative role of these
disturbances.
4.3. Implications for management
What are the implications for ecological restoration? First, we
found unexpected diversity in ﬁre regime and forest stand struc-
ture illustrating that more site-speciﬁc information on topography
and other site variables is needed for developing restoration treat-
ment prescriptions and accurate ﬁre behavior models in warm/dry
mixed conifer. While this result makes management more compli-
cated, because a uniform prescription would save time and money,
it is positive in a biological sense because there is diversity in ﬁre
regimes and habitats (Korb et al., 2007). Second, managers cannot
infer that the relationship between the pre-settlement forest and
the current forest observed at Lower Middle Mountain (Fulé
et al., 2009) is similar across all warm/dry mixed conifer forests
in the San Juan Mountains. There would be general similarities
but details would differ as illustrated along this transect. Finally,
the differences we observed imply not just quantitative change
in restoration prescriptions (e.g., minor adjustment in prescribed
ﬁre intervals) but perhaps a qualitative change (Iniguez et al.,
2009) where evidence suggests historical ﬁres of mixed severity
at all of our study sites. Restoration actions such as tree thinning
and prescribed underburning might be appropriate for sites such

as Grassy Mountain, but allowing spatially variable patches of rel-
atively severe ﬁres to burn at sites such as Lower Middle and Jack-
son Mountain and perhaps even Grassy Mountain could be
ecologically appropriate.
