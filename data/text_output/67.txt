Abstract
We examined the effects of presettlement forest resto-
ration treatments on the nesting success of Western
Bluebirds in ponderosa pine forests of northwestern
Arizona, U.S.A. From 1998 to 2001 we monitored 97 ac-
tive Western Bluebird nests, 41 in current-condition
untreated forest and 56 in restoration-treated forest.
We found no effect of restoration treatments on clutch
size and little effect on the number of nestlings per
nest. However, in treated forest stands number of fledg-
lings per nest averaged 1.6 times greater, and proba-
bility of a nest surviving to successfully fledge at least
one young was up to 4.2 times greater than in untreated
forest. Probability of a nest succeeding averaged 0.39 !
0.11 (SE) and 0.75 ! 0.06 from 1999 to 2001 in un-
treated and treated forests, respectively. In addition, in
treated forest, average number of nests infested with
the blowfly parasite Protocalliphora sialia was up to
4.3 times greater, and number of parasites per fledg-
ling was up to 10.7 times greater than in untreated for-
est. Overall, the data suggest that in treated forest
Western Bluebirds have a higher probability of suc-
cessfully fledging young, but they are at greater risk
of parasitic infestations, of which the ultimate effects
on post-fledging survival are unknown.
Key words: forest restoration, nest success, ponderosa
pine, Protocalliphora sialia, Western Bluebird.
Introduction
D
ecades of fire suppression, cattle grazing, and log-
ging have altered both forest structure and eco-
logical processes in Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa pine)
forests in the North American southwest (Cooper 1960;
Covington & Moore 1994; Swetnam et al. 1999). Such
practices have resulted in tree densities up to 8.5 times
greater today than before Euro-American settlement of
the region (Fulé et al. 1997). The old-growth ponderosa
pine trees that dominated forests of a century ago have
been replaced by dense stands of young small trees.
Presettlement ponderosa pine tree densities (ca. 1900)
ranged between 20 and 127 trees per ha (Woolsey 1911),
and current-condition densities have been documented
up to 1,873 trees per ha (Covington & Moore 1994).
These conditions have led to poor nutrient cycling; in-
creased potential for large, high-intensity, stand-replac-
ing fires (Covington & Moore 1994; Swetnam et al.
1999); and a general belief that wildlife diversity has de-
clined in modern ponderosa forests (Noss et al. 1995).
For these reasons, efforts to restore southwestern for-
ests are gaining momentum (Covington & Moore 1994;
Morgan et al. 1994); however, opinions vary regarding
how best to return these forests to more natural healthy
conditions (Wagner et al. 2000). Consequently, a variety
of different prescriptions is being implemented across
the range of ponderosa pine forests. The treatment pre-
scription applied in this study attempts to return tree
densities and spatial patterns to that believed present
circa 1870 (Covington et al. 1997).
These treatments incorporate mechanical forest thin-
ning, slash manipulation, burning, and reseeding with
native grasses and forbs and are scheduled for 1,619 ha.
In addition, periodic prescribed burning is planned in this
area to mimic a natural fire regime. Under this prescrip-
tion, restoration treatments may effect an immediate
85% decrease in tree numbers and a change in the age
and size class structure of treated forests. The desired
result is that treated forests will ultimately emulate pre-
settlement conditions over a broad spectrum of struc-
tural, floristic, microclimatic, and ecological criteria.
These treatments, however, may reduce vertical and
horizontal structural diversity below that believed to
have historically been present until forests redevelop
old growth characteristics. It will take centuries for for-
ests treated in this manner to attain structural and func-
tional characteristics of old-growth forests, and there is
concern whether viable populations of native wildlife
will be retained in these areas in the interim. In this con-
text we initiated a study to determine the effects of such

restoration treatments on several taxa of native wildlife
that inhabit these forests. Here we address the short-
term effects of presettlement forest restoration treat-
ments on Western Bluebirds (Sialia mexicana).
Western Bluebirds are native, insectivorous, second-
ary cavity nesters historically described as birds of open
areas, forest clearings, savannahs, or forest edges (Grin-
nell et al. 1930; Bent 1949; Stokes & Stokes 1996). Spe-
cific habitat requirements for Western Bluebirds in-
clude nest cavities, low perches from which to hunt,
and insect prey in the lower understory and at ground
level. However, recent declines have been noted for the
Western Bluebird in many parts of its range (Ehrlich et
al. 1988), and one adverse impact noted by Guinan et al.
(2000) was fire suppression activities that have caused
open forest habitat to decrease. Declines have also been
attributed to removal of large trees in which nest cavi-
ties were most often found and to increased competi-
tion for nest sites with Passer domesticus (House Spar-
row), Sturnus vulgaris (European Starling), and Tachycineta
spp. (Swallows) (Guinan et al. 2000).
Nestlings of many species of nidicolous birds, espe-
cially cavity-nesting species, are parasitized by larval
blowflies of the genus Protocalliphora (Diptera: Calli-
phoridae) (Bennett & Whitworth 1992). Protocalliphora
larvae are obligatory blood-sucking parasites that feed
intermittently on the blood of nestlings. Three larval
stages occur in the nest, with free-living adult flies
emerging in 14 to 21 days. Adults overwinter and fe-
males then oviposit eggs in active nests from late May
through July (Bennett & Whitworth 1991). Factors con-
ducive to high rates of infestation include renesting in
the same area and (or) nest each year, infestation by
only a single species of Protocalliphora, and a nest struc-
ture that would retain larvae and is kept relatively free
of moisture and feces (Bennett & Whitworth 1992).
Demonstrating these traits, we expected Western Blue-
birds to be highly vulnerable to infestation.
In 1998, we began investigating the effects of forest
restoration treatments on the nesting success of West-
ern Bluebirds. Our primary objective was to compare
the number of bluebirds fledged per nest between cur-
rent-condition and restoration-treated forest types, but
we also compared clutch size, nestlings per nest, and
Mayfield (1975) nest success to ascertain at which nest-
ing stage differences occurred. Finally, we compared
number of nests infested with parasites and ratio of par-
asites-to-fledgling between forest types.
Study Area
The Mt. Trumbull area is an isolated mountain range in
the southern portion of the Uinkaret Plateau on the
Arizona Strip, north of the Colorado River and west
of the Kaibab Plateau. The study area (36"22#30## N,
113"10#25## W) lies between Mts. Trumbull (2,448 m)
and Logan (2,398 m) and has been shaped by volcanic
activity. The major vegetative communities within the
study area include pure ponderosa pine forest and pon-
derosa pine-deciduous forests composed of Quercus
gambelii (Gambel oak) and Robinia neomexicana (New
Mexican locust). Pinus edulis (pinyon pine) and Junipe-
rus osteosperma (juniper) occur sporadically throughout
the area and dominate south-facing slopes.
The Mt. Trumbull area has a bimodal pattern of pre-
cipitation, with most occurring in winter and summer;
spring and fall are relatively dry. Average minimum
and maximum daily temperatures during June were
58.0"F and 89.5"F, with an average annual precipitation
of 30.8 cm during 1948 through 1985 (WRCC 1985).
Euro-American settlement of the Mt. Trumbull area
occurred circa 1870, with logging of the area beginning
2 years later. Small portable sawmills operated in the
area until the 1960s (Altschul & Fairley, unpublished
data). In addition to logging, cattle grazing was also in-
troduced in the 1870s, a practice still in use today. As
with much of the North American southwest, the Mt.
Trumbull area has been fire suppressed for much of the
past century (Ecological Restoration Institute, unpub-
lished data).
Restoration treatments began at Mt. Trumbull in 1996
and are scheduled for 1,093 ha, with approximately 607
ha to serve as untreated control forest. Pretreatment
basal area of all trees and of ponderosa pine were simi-
lar between pretreatment and no-treatment areas. How-
ever, oak basal area in one pretreatment unit was
higher than in other pretreatment areas or no-treatment
areas. None of the remaining areas differed with regard
to oak basal area. No other tree species were abundant
enough to compare.
Methods
We conducted this study during the 1998, 1999, 2000,
and 2001 breeding seasons (May through July). Less
than 20 ha in one unit had been treated by 1998, and in
this year we monitored nests only in untreated forest.
Two units totaling 84 ha had been treated by 1999, and
five units totaling 203 ha had been treated by 2000, in-
cluding doubling the size of a unit treated before 1999.
No additional area was treated between the 2000 and
2001 seasons. Units ranged from 1 to 5 years posttreat-
ment age during our study. Nests from untreated forest
areas were monitored throughout 810 ha of forest sur-
rounding the treated units during 1999 through 2001.
We began searching for Western Bluebird nests upon
pair establishment of territories each year, except 1998
when all nests were in nestling stage when found. We
split our nest search effort evenly between treated and
untreated areas in 1999 and 2000. In 2001 much of the

untreated forest had been logged but not fully treated,
and we monitored more nests in the treated units.
To find nests each year, we systematically searched
among and throughout all treatment units and contin-
ued nest searches in all units throughout the breeding
cycle each year. In untreated forest we used systematic
survey data collected during spring migration season to
guide nest searches. With the exception of one nest in
untreated forest and one nest in treated forest in 2001,
all nests were located more than 50 m from treatment
edges.
We located nests by following adult bluebirds trans-
porting nesting material or prey items to natural tree
cavities. Upon locating each nest, we visually inspected
the contents to determine nesting status. We inspected
cavities using a ladder, mirror with a pivoting head,
and a Mini-Mag (Mag Instruments, Inc., Ontario, CA,
U.S.A.) flashlight or a micro-video camera (Super Cir-
cuits, Leander, TX, U.S.A.) mounted on top of a tele-
scoping pole. We inspected nests every third day to
monitor progress except near expected hatching and
fledging dates, when we inspected cavities every other
day to accurately ascertain date of occurrence. All nest
inspections were conducted in a manner to minimize
potential monitoring-induced loss (Ralph et al. 1993).
During every nest inspection, we recorded the num-
ber of eggs or nestlings present. We defined clutch size
as the greatest number of eggs in the nest at any one
time, with incubation starting when the next to last egg
was laid (Mayfield 1975). We defined the number of
nestlings by the greatest number of nestlings occurring
in the nest at any one time. The number of fledglings
was determined by the number of nestlings observed in
the nest immediately before fledging.
During 1999 to 2001 we collected nesting material
from all accessible cavities within a week after fledging
and examined contents for the presence and number of
Protocalliphora larvae and pupae. All nests were scored
as either infested or not and by parasite burden, which
was the ratio of parasites-per-fledgling.
Statistical Analysis
All data were initially tested for normality using a Kol-
mogorov-Smirnov one-sample test against a Lillifores
standard normal distribution (Milton 1992). We used
two-sample t tests or Mann-Whitney U tests (Zar 1996)
depending on normality of sample populations to test
for differences in clutch size, nestlings per nest, fledg-
lings per nest, and parasite burden between untreated
and treated forests. We tested for differences in the
number of infested nests between the two forest types
using a two-tail Fisher’s exact test. All tests were based
on the null hypothesis of no difference between un-
treated and treated forest types. Results of all tests were
considered significant when p $ 0.05.
We calculated nest success using Mayfield’s (1975)
survival probability because it takes into account that
nests found at different stages introduce bias in sur-
vival estimates. Mayfield’s survival analysis does not
take into account partial losses. We made no formal
comparisons of survival probability and report the dif-
ferences between forest types in a descriptive manner.
Results
We monitored 97 active Western Bluebird nests during
the summers of 1998 through 2001, 41 in untreated cur-
rent-condition forest (8 in 1998, 11 in 1999, 17 in 2000, 5 in
2001) and 56 in restoration-treated forest (9 in 1999, 19 in
2000, 28 in 2001) (Table 1). We found no difference in
clutch size between nests in untreated and treated forest
in any of the 3 years examined (Mann-Whitney U %
33.00, p % 0.692 in 1999; Mann-Whitney U % 66.50, p %
0.270 in 2000; Mann-Whitney U % 42.50, p % 0.594 in
2001) (Table 1). In addition, clutch size did not differ be-

tween forest types when data from all years were pooled
(Mann-Whitney U % 613.00, p % 0.452). All nests moni-
tored in 1998 were found after nestlings had hatched, so
data from this year were not included in this comparison.
Number of nestlings per nest also did not differ be-
tween forest types in 1999 (t-test % 0.55; p % 0.592) or
2001 (Mann-Whitney U % 51.00, p % 0.443), but was
greater in treated forests than in untreated forests in
2000 (Mann-Whitney U % 61.00; p % 0.033; Table 1).
When pooled over all years, nestlings per nest did not
differ between forest types (Mann-Whitney U % 1028.50,
p % 0.766).
Treated forest areas fledged more young per nest in
both 1999 (Mann-Whitney U % 22.00, p % 0.032) and
2000 (Mann-Whitney U % 91.00, p % 0.037) but not in
2001 (Mann-Whitney U % 49.50, p % 0.339) (Table 1).
When pooled over all years fledglings per nest differed
between forest types (Mann-Whitney U % 811.50, p '
0.024), with 1.6 times more fledglings produced per
nest in treated forest than untreated forest.
Probability of nesting success over the entire cycle
was 1.4 times greater in treated forest in 1999, 1.7 times
greater in 2000 and 4.2 times greater in 2001 (Fig. 1). Al-
though the probability of nest success in untreated for-
ests remained constant during 1999 and 2000, averaging
0.50 ! 0.01, it decreased to 0.17 in 2001 for an overall
average of 0.39 ! 0.11. In contrast, the probability of
nest success in treated forest averaged 0.75 ! 0.06 dur-
ing 1999 through 2001.
Number of nests infested with Protocalliphora was sig-
nificantly higher in treated forest than untreated forest
in both 1999 and 2000 (Fisher’s exact p % 0.022 and
0.009, respectively). Our sample of nests in untreated
forest in 2001 was too small to validly compare with
treated area nests. However, infestation rates in treated
forests were 4.3 times greater than in untreated forest in
1999, 1.8 times greater in 2000, and 1.4 times greater in
2001 (Table 1).
Parasite burden (parasites per fledgling) was higher
in treated forest nests in all 3 years (Mann-Whitney U %
6.00, p % 0.007; t test % (2.48, p % 0.026; Mann-Whitney
U % 2.50, p % 0.048, respectively) (Table 1). When
pooled over all years, parasite burden remained signifi-
cantly higher in nests in treated forest (Mann-Whitney
U % 106.50, p % 0.001). In no year did parasite burden
exceed 10 in any untreated forest nest; however, in
treated forest in 2000, 43% of infested nests had parasite
burdens of at least 10, and, in 2001 47% of infested nests
had parasite burdens of at least 10.
Discussion
The effects of presettlement restoration treatments on
the nesting success of Western Bluebirds are complex.
Restoration treatments did not affect clutch size and
had little effect on number of nestlings per nest. Strong
effects were realized on number of nestlings fledged
per nest, nest predation rates, nest infestation rates, and
parasite burden. Bluebirds nesting in treated forest had
a higher probability of nest success and fledged more
young per nest overall. However, this was due to differ-
ential rates of nest predation between forest types, and
this difference diminished over time since treatment. Fi-
nally, bluebird nests in treated forest were at greater
risk of infestation by Protocalliphora.
Clutch size varied from year to year but did not differ
between the two forest types. Clutch size has been re-
lated to the physical condition of the female during pair
forming and vitellogenesis and has also been correlated
with prey availability on the breeding territory (Drent
& Daan 1980). In this context we conclude that resource
conditions were sufficiently similar each year in both
forest types that females produced clutches of similar
size. Our results are consistent with those of Brawn
(1991), who also found no difference in the clutch size
of Western Bluebirds nesting in two different forest
densities in northern Arizona.
In both forest types in 1999 and in untreated forests in
2000 an average of one egg per clutch failed to hatch. In
treated forests in 2000, however, 0.5 eggs per clutch
failed to hatch, resulting in significantly more nestlings
per nest. Similarly, in 2001 an average of 2.5 eggs per
clutch failed to hatch in untreated forest, whereas only
1.2 failed in treated areas. We therefore conclude that
hatching success of eggs contributed to the difference in
number of bluebirds fledged per nest in 2 of 3 years.
The primary difference in average number of young
fledged per nest each year was due to differential rates
of nest loss to predation between the two forest types.

Differential nest loss resulted in a Mayfield probability
of nest success of up to 4.2 times greater for bluebirds
nesting in treated forests than in untreated forests. Saab
and Vierling (2001) noted similar trends in nest success
of Lewis’ Woodpecker populations compared between
burned ponderosa and cottonwood riparian stands and
reported differential nest predation as the causal factor
in their study. Considering only successful nests in our
study, average number of young fledged per nest did
not differ between forest types in any year or over all
years pooled. However, percent of nests lost to preda-
tion ranged from 25 to 45% over the four years we ex-
amined untreated forests (Table 1). The increase in nest
predation from 0 to 25% in treated forest over 1999 to
2001 indicates that predation pressure was gradually
increasing there, and the differences we noted in nest
success due to predation may disappear as treated for-
ests are recolonized by nest predators.
Common bluebird nest predators include snakes,
small corvids, and ground squirrels, all of which were
present during our investigation. Almost all failures we
documented during the nestling phase in both un-
treated and treated forests were a result of predation.
We video documented two instances of Pituophus mel-
anoleucus (gopher snake) predation on nestlings, during
which entire broods were consumed in one event. Fail-
ures that occurred during incubation were also a result
of predation; however, we are unsure by what preda-
tor. Entire clutches were removed over the course of a
few days and no eggshells were left in the nest.
During our study, abundances of nest predators ap-
peared lower in treated areas than in untreated areas.
Three of five snake species we documented in the area
prey on eggs and nestlings and are good climbers. How-
ever, we did not observe these potential predators in
treated areas to date. Prescribed fires associated with
treatments burn extremely hot (personal observation of
authors) due to the high fuel loads, and Simons (1989)
documented the occurrence of reptile mortality after fire.
Protocalliphora infestation of nests was consistently
greater in treated forests, with )95% of nests analyzed
containing blowflies in 2000 and 2001. Parasite burden
in infested nests was from 2.3 to more than 4 times
greater in treated forests than at infested nests in un-
treated forests during our study. Waltz and Covington
(2000) reported that abundance and diversity of pollina-
tor insects increased in treated forest areas, but we have
no evidence whether blowflies responded similarly.
Bennett and Whitworth (1991) reported that Protocalli-
phora adults were highly photopositive, with activity in-
creasing with light intensity. Gold and Dahlsten (1989)
similarly reported that Protocalliphora activity increased
at nests when nests were exposed to full sunlight and
believed nest odor was the primary stimuli used in lo-
cating active nests. Although we do not know whether
blowfly abundance differed between untreated and
treated forest types, nests in treated forest received far
more direct sunlight because of the drastically reduced
overstory canopy and the poorly developed canopies of
the remaining trees.
Most research suggests that Protocalliphora parasitism
alone rarely causes death in nestling birds (Gold &
Dahlsten 1983; Roby et al. 1992; Whitworth & Bennett
1992). However, cases attributing nestling mortality to
blowfly infestation have been documented (Halstead
1988, Whitworth & Bennett 1992, see p. 2185).
Although there is some debate regarding the direct
effects of parasitism on nestling survival, data have
shown that blowfly parasitism can decrease hemoglo-
bin and hematocrit levels in nestlings (Whitworth &
Bennett 1992), cause anemia from high blood loss (Gold
& Dahlsten 1983; Hurtrez-Boussè et al. 1997), delay weight
recession associated with tissue maturation (Johnson et
al. 1991), and increase parental energy expenditure to
help compensate for the effects of infestation (Johnson
& Albrecht 1993; Tripet & Richner 1997). All these fac-
tors affect the nestlings’ overall health and body condi-
tion before fledging and may decrease probability of
survival after fledging. In 2000 and 2001, nestlings in 43
and 47% of infested nests in treated forests had parasite
burdens of at least 10, with parasite burden as heavy as
25 larvae per nestling in one nest. Using Roby et al.’s
(1992) estimate of daily blood loss in a 10-day-old East-
ern Bluebird (Sialia sialia) nestling infested with 34 lar-
vae, a parasite burden of 25 larvae per nestling would
result in an estimated daily blood loss of 21% of total
blood volume. This is a significant deficit to overcome
on a daily basis, and the effects of such compensation
may not be manifest until after the nestlings have left
the nest. However, we know of no research investigat-
ing the effects of Protocalliphora infestation on postfledg-
ing survival.
Full effects of restoration treatments on bluebird popu-
lation trends and recruitment of young into the breeding
population are still unknown. The differences we ob-
served in average number of fledglings produced per
nest between the two forest types appeared to diminish
during our study. However, the probability of a nest be-
ing successful remained higher in treated forest areas,
suggesting that if breeding densities were similar be-
tween the two forest types more young would be fledged
in treated forest areas. In addition, fledglings from treated
forest nests were more heavily infested than their un-
treated forest counterparts, and their successful recruit-
ment into the breeding population needs to be examined
to fully understand long-term effects of restoration treat-
ments on Western Bluebird population viability.
Restoration of forested land is rapidly gaining mo-
mentum in the southwest, with thousands of hectares
now scheduled for treatment each year. We report the

short-term effects of one restoration prescription on one
wildlife species. Responses of additional species to res-
toration treatments need to be studied at appropriate
spatiotemporal scales, because it is imperative that for-
est restoration does not focus on structural attributes at
the expense of, or without regard to, native wildlife. As
resource managers and stewards of our lands and native
wildlife, it is vitally important that we understand the
full effects of restoration treatments on the entire ecosys-
tem before implementation on large scales commences.
