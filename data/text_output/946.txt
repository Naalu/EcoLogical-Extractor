Twenty-Four Years of Prescribed Fire at Gus A.
Pearson Natural Area 
The G.A. Pearson Natural Area (GAPNA) is located within the US Forest
Service Fort Valley Experimental Forest, site of the oldest forest research
station in the US (established 1908). A decommissioned portion of the GAPNA
is also the site of a long-term ecological restoration experimental and
demonstration area, which is a joint research project among Northern Arizona
University’s Ecological Restoration Institute, School of Forestry, and USFS
Rocky Mountain Research Station.
 
The site was not commercially harvested and retains a complement of mature
ponderosa pines and a dense growth of young pines originating from seed
crops between the 1910s to early 1920s. The restoration experiment funded by
the National Science Foundation in 1992 was designed to compare three
treatments: 1) tree thinning to emulate forest structure a prior to Anglo-

European settlement, with prescribed burning; 2) tree thinning only, without ﬁre;
and 3) a control.
 
This fall, the ERI worked with Forest Service burn crews to implement a
prescribed burn in the 3-acre full restoration section. This site has burned every
four years starting in 1994, making this the seventh ﬁre there in 24 years.
GAPNA is an important site because it contributes a large body of research on
restoration of frequent-ﬁre forests. Data from GAPNA demonstrate that forest
health improves most in restoration treatments that include thinning and
burning, mimicking the natural structure and function of the forest.

The use of best available science information (BASI) is advised or mandated in
many public land, resource management, and environmental laws, policies,

and regulations, yet there is no single deﬁnition of “best available science.” This
paper describes sources of science information and how to best determine
BASI requirements.

Ecologists tested the assumption that plant survival rates are tied to the
relationship between plant traits, e.g., leaf area, and environmental conditions.
They found that trait–environment relationships were unreliable estimates of
how traits affected survival.

News from the Field
Research and Development – 2018 Fall & Summer Field Season
Overview
By ERI R&D Staff
ERI’s 2018 ﬁeld season included several new and continuing forest restoration
and fuel management studies across Arizona and southwestern Colorado. With
support and partnership from the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management,
and Fort Lewis College, ERI crews collected ﬁeld data for projects spanning a
range of forest types. Continuing work from 2017, crews spent the summer
remeasuring long-term monitoring plots on a landscape-scale study on Grand
Canyon-Parashant National Monument. Plots installed in the mid-1990s were
remeasured to evaluate responses of overstory trees, regeneration, fuels, and
understory plant communities to restoration treatments. In another project,
similar forest structure and vegetation data were collected from a restoration
study initiated in 2003 in warm-dry mixed-conifer forests of the San Juan
National Forest, CO. In central Arizona, crews conducted ﬁeld measurements
to investigate ecological responses, mastication (vegetation chipping and
grinding), and other fuel reduction treatments in transitional ponderosa pine–
interior chaparral ecosystems on the Prescott and Tonto national forests. Lastly,
near Flagstaff, ﬁeld crews revisited long-term studies on the Ft. Valley
Experimental Forest and assisted Kristi Baker in data collection for her

undergraduate senior project examining ponderosa pine regeneration patterns
after restoration treatments. The results from these studies will be used to
inform restoration planning and adaptive management for ponderosa pine and
mixed-conifer ecosystems across the Southwest.
ERI Science Delivery and Outreach News 
By Dr. Amy Waltz, Director of Science Delivery
We are committed to assessing the latest science needs and communicating
primary restoration science to our land management partners to better meet
forest management goals. The following are highlights across this broad
program of work:
 
West-Wide.ERI staff are working with the US Forest Service Washington Ofﬁce
and other research partners to update and revise the national set of indicators
for the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration (CFLR) Project’s 10-year
report. The CFLR projects are currently funded by a 10-year act that closes in
2019. Although the 23 CFLR projects are different in scale and partners, a set
of standardized indicators was developed in 2011 to measure progress across
the act’s ﬁve objectives. Key outcomes include better understanding of
successes and lessons learned in the largest landscape experiment of
collaborative forest restoration. More information can be found here.
 
Regional and Forest Projects.The Frye Fire burned a large proportion of Mt.
Graham on the Coronado National Forest in 2017. The landscape experienced
a variety of ﬁre intensities. The ERI had a small restoration demo in a dry
mixed-conifer forest on the mountain, including a set of 10 plots and a 3-acre
stem map. In 2018, we remeasured these plots and stem map, and are
currently analyzing the data to describe in more detail the ﬁre effects on a small
portion of the dry mixed-conifer forest. Results will be available in the spring of
2019.
 
Best Available Science Publication. Our partner federal agencies are
directed to use the best available science information (BASI) to support land
and resource management decisions. A recent publication in the Journal of

Forestryby ERI and The Nature Conservancy authors highlight these directives
and the barriers, and provide recommendations to better meet these directives.
