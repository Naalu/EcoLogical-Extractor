Abstract
We examined the 7-year effects of three restoration
treatments on leaf physiology and insect-resistance
characteristics of pre-settlement age ponderosa pines
(Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) at the Gus Pearson
Natural Area (GPNA) in northern Arizona. Restoration
treatments were: (1) thinned in 1993 to approximate
pre-Euro-American settlement stand structure, (2) thinned
plus prescribed burned in 1994 and 1998, and (3) untreated
control. Tree physiological and insect-resistance character-
istics were measured in year 2000, 7 years after thinning,
using the same procedures as an earlier study performed in
1996. Consistent with the 1996 results, pre-dawn water
potential in 2000 was consistently lower in the control than
both thinned treatments. Both thinned treatments con-
tinued to have increased foliar nitrogen concentration in
leaves 7 years after treatment. However lower leaf
nitrogen concentration in the thinned and burned com-
pared with the thinned treatment suggests lower nitrogen
availability to trees in repeatedly burned plots. Analysis of
leaf gas exchange characteristics and carbon isotope
content (13C) suggests continued stimulation of photo-
synthesis by both thinning treatments. Differences among
treatments in resin volume, a measure of bark beetle
resistance, depended on season of measurement. Trees in
both thinning treatments continued to have increased leaf
toughness, a measure of resistance to insect folivores. Our
results show that many beneficial effects of restoration
treatments on carbon, water, and nitrogen relations and
insect-resistance characteristics of pre-settlement ponder-
osa pines continue to be expressed 7 years after treatment
at the GPNA.

Introduction
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) forests
in northern Arizona have changed because of fire suppres-
sion and grazing over the last century (Madany & West
1983; Savage & Swetnam 1990; Covington & Moore 1994;
Fule´ et al. 1997). Stand structure of many of these forests
before fire suppression was characterized by groups of old-
growth trees interspersed among openings dominated by
herbaceous plants (Fule´ et al. 1997; Mast et al. 1999).
Frequent,
low-intensity
surface
fires
maintained
this
stand structure (Weaver 1951; Dieterich & Swetnam
1984; Covington & Moore 1994; Swetnam & Baisan
1996). Many current stands are comprised of dense thick-
ets of pole-sized trees that have excluded most understory
grasses, forbs, and shrubs (Covington & Moore 1994;
Dahms & Geils 1997). The over-stocked condition of
current stands has generated interest in restoring forest
structure to the more open conditions found before
Euro-American settlement.
Thinning and prescribed burning can be used to restore
open-stand conditions (Covington et al. 1997; Covington
2000). Thinning also stimulates growth and resource
uptake of post-settlement (i.e., young trees established
after Euro-American settlement in the late 1800s) ponder-
osa pines (Schubert 1974; Wyant et al. 1983, 1986; Ronco
et al. 1985; Kolb et al. 1998). However studies of the
response of pre-settlement (i.e., old-growth trees estab-
lished
before
Euro-American
settlement)
ponderosa
pines to thinning and burning restoration treatments are
limited. For example such studies in the southwestern
United States have been limited to the Gus Pearson
Natural Area (GPNA) located near Flagstaff, Arizona,
and these studies were conducted only 2 and 3 years after
thinning (Feeney et al. 1998; Stone et al. 1999).
The restoration experiment at the GPNA consists of two
restoration treatments established in 19931994, designed to
restore stand structure and tree age distribution to condi-
tions similar to those present before Euro-American settle-
ment, and an untreated control. Treatments were based on
site-specific information about stand condition in the year
1876 from dendroecological analyses (Covington et al. 1997;
Mast et al. 1999). One treatment consisted of thinning most
post-settlement trees, and the other treatment combined
thinning and prescribed burning. Thinning increased water

and nitrogen uptake and net photosynthetic rate and radial
stem growth of pre-settlement trees in the first 3 years after
treatment (Feeney et al. 1998; Stone et al. 1999). Moreover
prescribed burning in 1994 (1 year after thinning) had little
effect on tree physiology and growth of pre-settlement trees.
However resin volume in response to wounding of the
phloem, a key tree defense against bark beetles, was greater
in the thinned and burned treatment than in the thinned
treatment or untreated control (Feeney et al. 1998). In
addition foliage toughness, a mechanism of ponderosa pine
resistance to insect folivores such as sawflies (McMillin &
Wagner 1993; Wagner & Zhang 1993), of pre-settlement
trees at the GPNA increased 2 and 3 years after thinning
(Feeney et al. 1998). Ponderosa pines resist bark beetle
colonization through an integrative process of constitutive
and inducible defenses (Wood 1962; Brown et al. 1987).
Wounding of resin ducts results in an accumulation of
resin, which is a physical barrier against colonizing insects.
Increased resin volume provides increased resistance against
western (Dendroctonus brevicomis LeConte) and mountain
pine (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) beetles (Smith
1975; Raffa & Berryman 1982, 1983). Thinning may decrease
colonization attempts of mountain pine beetle by increasing
distribution
of
pheromone
plumes
(McCambridge
&
Stevens 1982; Larsson et al. 1983; Olsen et al. 1996). There-
fore there may be a relationship between restoration
treatments, host defenses, and colonization success by bark
beetles. However long-term changes in resin defenses of
pre-settlement trees and interactions with local beetle
populations due to restoration treatments in the south-
western United States are generally unknown.
The objectives of our study were to assess the 7-year
effects of restoration treatments at the GPNA on leaf
carbon, nitrogen, and water relations and insect-resistance
characteristics of pre-settlement-age ponderosa pines. We
present data from the year 2000, which was 7, 6, and 2
years after the thinning, first and second prescribed burns,
respectively. We also present leaf carbon isotope ratio data
from the years 19982000 to provide insight into treatment
effects on leaf carbon and water relations in years 5, 6, and
7 after thinning. Our hypothesis is that the positive effects
of restoration treatments on the physiological condition of
pre-settlement trees would continue for 7 years after initial
treatment.
However
we
also
expected
a
dampened
response of pre-settlement trees to these treatments 7
years after treatment compared to the first 3 years after
treatment
because
of
increased
occupancy
and
soil
resource use by herbaceous vegetation in thinned plots
(Covington et al. 1997; M. M. Moore, School of Forestry,
Northern Arizona University, unpublished data).
Methods
Study Site
This study was conducted at the GPNA, within the Coco-
nino National Forest approximately 10 km northwest of
Flagstaff, Arizona The study site is 3 ha in area at an
elevation of 2,1952,255 m with a southwest aspect and
05% slope. Soils, derived from basalt and volcanic cin-
ders, are classified as a Brolliar clay loam, fine, smectitic,
Typic Argiboroll. Mean annual precipitation is 56.7 cm,
with approximately half of it as snow and the other half
as rain during the late-summer monsoon season (August
September). Mean annual air temperature in Flagstaff,
Arizona is 7.5C. The climate is subhumid, with early-
summer droughts common. The average frost-free growing
season is 94 days (Schubert 1974).
The plant community at the GPNA was a previously
unharvested ponderosa pine stand containing even-aged
groups of pole-sized trees and uneven-aged groups of
pre-settlement trees (Schubert 1974). Pole-sized trees
(10.037.4 cm dbh) are the predominant size class. The
greatest Euro-American influences at the GPNA have
been livestock grazing, which occurred from 1876 to
1910, and fire suppression. Before our study, the last fire
in the vicinity of the GPNA occurred in 1876 (Dieterich
1980).
Experimental Design
The experiment includes two treatments (thinned and
thinned-and-burned) and an untreated control. The con-
trol was about 1 ha and located nonrandomly on one side
of the GPNA (Covington et al. 1997). Each treatment was
randomly assigned to five 0.20-ha plots, and the two treat-
ments were interspersed. The control was divided into five
0.20-ha plots for sampling. This experimental design does
not have true spatial replication of the control; therefore
precautions were taken to strengthen our inferences of
treatment effects. Pre-treatment (19921993) levels of soil
total nitrogen concentration (p 5 0.19), phosphorus con-
centration (p 5 0.25), organic matter mass (p 5 0.19), and
predawn water potential (PWP) (p 5 0.82 for May to June,
p 5 0.25 for July to August), tree basal area growth rate
(p 5 0.96), stem diameter (p 5 0.32), and tree-to-tree com-
petition index (p 5 0.66) of pre-settlement trees did not
differ among the areas that were treated (Feeney et al.
1998; Kay & Hart 1998b; Stone et al. 1999). Thus resource
availability, tree growth, and tree physiological condition
were similar among treatment areas before thinning and
burning.
Thinning was conducted to simulate the pre-settlement
stand structure (Edminster & Olson 1996; Covington et al.
1997). The average pre-treatment basal area was 34.5 m2/
ha, which was retained in the control area. In November
1993 thinned plots were thinned to a basal area of 13.0 m2/
ha, with all pre-settlement trees and all trees >40 cm dbh
retained (Covington et al. 1997). In addition smaller dia-
meter post-settlement trees were retained near stumps,
snags, and down pre-settlement logs to recreate the
clumped pattern of the pre-settlement forest. Following
the thinning treatment, both thinned areas had an average
dbh of 40.9 cm and the control area had an average dbh of

16.6 cm (Covington et al. 1997). Thinned and burned
plots were burned under prescribed conditions in 1994
(October) and again in 1998 (October). Before the first
burn the organic layers of the forest floor and woody
debris were removed by hand raking to simulate pre-
settlement forest floor conditions, which would have had
little litter and debris due to frequent fire. To simulate
grassy forest floor conditions of the pre-settlement forest,
dried native grass foliage from a nearby prairie was added
(672 kg/ha dry biomass) to the burned plots before the first
burn. Fire characteristics of the 1994 burn were described
in Covington et al. (1997): flame length averaged 15 cm
with maximum lengths of 60 cm. For the second fire in
1998 flame length averaged 11 cm with maximum lengths
of 180240 cm that occurred in fallen limbs and needles of
wind-thrown trees.
We sampled 30 pre-settlement trees (two per 0.2-ha
plot) for water relations, leaf gas exchange, nitrogen and
carbon relations, and insect-resistance characteristics. An
additional 38 pre-settlement trees were included in the
measurements of bark beetle-resistance characteristics
(n 5 68; four or five trees per plot). All measured trees
were the same trees measured by Feeney et al. (1998),
except for four trees that died between 1997 and 2000
(Kolb et al. 2001). In year 2000 the measurement trees
ranged in age from 123 to 431 years, with an average age
of 234 years (1 se 5 15.3 years).
Leaf Water Relations
We measured PWP, mid-morning (MMWP), and mid-day
(MWP) leaf water potential in June and August 2000 with
a pressure chamber (Plant Moisture Stress Instrument Co.,
Corvallis, OR, U.S.A.) on lower crown, 1-year-old needles.
Needles were excised, sealed in a plastic bag with slightly
moistened paper towel, and placed in the dark in a cooler.
We made all measurements within 2 hr of needles being
removed from the tree (Kaufmann & Thor 1982). Meas-
urements were made until three readings were obtained
within 0.1 MPa of each other for each sample tree. We
used the average value for these three measurements for
each tree.
Leaf Gas Exchange
Instantaneous
net
photosynthetic
rate
(Pn),
stomatal
conductance to water vapor (gs), and internal leaf CO2
concentration (Ci) were measured over a 30-s period with
a portable, closed-system LI-6200 infrared gas analyzer
(LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, U.S.A.) on needles of each
study tree on 10 June and 21 August 2000. The measure-
ments were conducted on sunlit, 1-year-old needles on
excised branches from the lower to mid-crown at 0800
and 1100 hours. Two two- or three-needle fascicles were
used for each measurement. Net photosynthetic rate and gs
were expressed on a total leaf area basis (all sides). Elec-
tronic digital calipers (Model CD-600 BS, Mitutoya Corp.,
Tokyo, Japan) were used to measure average leaf radius,
and total leaf area was estimated by a geometric model
that considers the fascicle as a dissected cylinder (Svenson
& Davies 1992).
Leaf Nitrogen and d13C
We collected current-year, 1-, and 2-year-old needles
adjacent to those used for water potential measurements
for nutrient analysis. Needles were oven dried at 70C for
48 hr and were ground in a Thomas-Wiley mill (3383-L10
series, Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ, U.S.A.) to pass
through a 20-mesh screen. Ground samples were analyzed
for total foliar nitrogen and carbon stable isotope content
(13C)
with
a
continuous-flow
mass
spectrometer
(Ceinstrument NC2100 and Delta Plus XL, Finnigan,
MAT, San Jose, CA, U.S.A.) at the Colorado Plateau
Stable Isotope Facility at Northern Arizona University.
Nitrogen concentration was expressed on a leaf area
(g/m2) and leaf mass basis (mg/g).
Insect-Resistance Characteristics
We measured resin flow and phloem thickness of the pre-
settlement trees in late June and early August 2000. We
removed the outer bark and phloem tissue using a 2.5 cm
diameter Osborne arch punch (Model 149, King Bearing
Co., Flagstaff, Arizona, U.S.A.). Directly below the wound
we attached metal funnels, which directed resin into 15-ml
vials. We collected resin 24 hr after wounding. We mea-
sured phloem thickness of the removed phloem disk with
an electronic digital caliper (Model CD-600 BS, Mitutoya
Corp.) by averaging two measurements taken 90  apart for
each disk.
We measured leaf toughness on the same trees used for
leaf water potential measurements in June and August
2000. Excised needles were stored in sealed plastic bags
in a dark cooler until the measurements were conducted.
Leaf toughness was measured in the laboratory on the day
of collection as the amount of pressure required to pene-
trate the needle with a penetrometer (TA-XT2 Texture
Analyzer, Texture Technologies Corp., Scarsdale, NY,
U.S.A.). A constant penetration depth (1 mm), needle
velocity, and needle surface area were used for all meas-
urements. Therefore leaf toughness was expressed as units
of mass (g). We calculated average leaf toughness for each
tree by averaging three measurements on each of five
needles from different fascicles.
Data Analysis
We compared the differences in response variables among
the thinned and thinned-and-burned treatments and the
control using fixed effects analysis of variance on plot
means (n 5 5 per treatment). Sources of variation were
block, treatment, sample date, and the interaction between
treatment
and
date.

consisted of three spatially adjacent plots (one of each
treatment), and all measurements were performed by
block. This is the same model used in analyses of 1995
and 1996 data from this experiment (Feeney et al. 1998).
We explored the use of path length for water movement
from soil to leaf (estimated stem height above ground plus
branch length to the sampled leaf) as a covariate in our
analysis of 13C to adjust for variation that may have been
caused by differences in cumulative resistance to water
flow among trees (Warren & Adams 2000). However
13C was not significantly correlated with path length for
any leaf age class; hence no covariate was used in analysis
of 13C.
Variances were homogeneous among treatments and
dates for all variables as indicated by Hartley’s test
(Sokal & Roalf 1995), except for Pn, resin flow, and leaf
N concentration on a mass basis. We log transformed Pn,
square-root (sqrt) transformed resin flow, and 1/sqrt trans-
formed N data to homogenize variances. Two outliers in
leaf nitrogen data were tested, removed, and replaced
using methods described by Sokal and Roalf (1995). As
reported by Feeney et al. (1998), mean comparisons
among treatments were performed with Fisher’s LSD,
and a threshold probability value of 0.10 was used in all
tests because of the inherent large variability of a popula-
tion of old trees. This p value also was chosen to maintain
consistency with previous studies at the GPNA (Feeney et
al. 1998; Kaye & Hart 1998a, 1998b; Kaye et al. 1999). All
statistical analyses were conducted using the SAS JMP
statistical package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, U.S.A.)
(SAS 1996).
Results
Leaf Water Relations
Tree PWP differed significantly among treatments. It was
highest in the thinned-and-burned treatment, intermediate
in the thinned treatment, and lowest in the control
(Tables 1 & 2). Average PWP was significantly lower in
June than August, and differences among treatments were
consistent between months (Table 1). MMWP and MWP
of trees did not differ among treatments, and the interac-
tion between month and treatment was not significant
(Table 1).
Leaf Gas Exchange
Net photosynthetic rate (Pn) of 1-year-old foliage did not
differ
significantly
among
restoration
treatments
or
between months (Tables 1 & 2). Leaf gs differed sig-
nificantly among treatments (Table 1) and was highest in
the thinned treatment, intermediate in the thinned and
burned treatment, and lowest in the control (Table 2). In
addition gs was significantly lower in June (mean 5 27.0,
SE 5 3.4 mmol m22 s21)
than
August
(mean 5 32.2,
SE 5 2.5 mmol m22 s21) (Table 1). Average leaf Ci was
significantly greater in the control treatment than the
thinned and thinned-and-burned treatments (Tables 1 &
2),
and
differences
among
treatments
depended
on
month (Table 1). Leaf Ci was similar among treatments in
June, but Ci in August was greater in the control
(mean 5 253.0, SE 5 23.4) than in both thinned treatments
(thinned: mean 5 136.0, 1 SE 5 30.9; thinned-and-burned:
mean 5 114.0, SE 5 30.1).
Leaf Nitrogen and d13C
Leaf Ntarea differed significantly among leaves formed in
different years and treatments, and the yeartreatment
interaction was also significant (Table 3). For current-
year (2000) and 2-year-old foliage (1998), Ntarea was high-
est in the thinned treatment, intermediate in the thinned
and burned treatment, and lowest in the control (Fig. 1b).
Leaf Ntarea of 1-year-old foliage was lower in the control
compared with both thinned treatments (Fig. 1b). The pat-
tern of differences among treatments and years was similar
for Ntmass as for Ntarea (Table 3; Fig. 1a & 1b), except for
2-year-old leaves (1998) in which Ntmass was not signifi-
cantly different among treatments.
Leaf 13C was greater in foliage formed in 2000 com-
pared with 1999 and 1998 (Table 3; Fig. 2). Leaf 13C was
not significantly influenced by treatments for any foliage
age class (Table 3; Fig. 2).
Insect-Resistance Characteristics
Resin volume differed significantly among treatments and
months (Tables 1 & 2), and was significantly greater across
all treatments in August than June (Fig. 3). In June resin
volume was greater from trees in the thinned and burned
treatment than trees in the control or thinned treatment
(Fig. 3). However in August, resin volume was greatest
from trees in the control, intermediate in the thinned-

among treatments or months (Tables 1 & 2).
Leaf toughness varied significantly among treatments
but not months (Tables 1 & 2). Leaf toughness was
greatest in the thinned treatment, intermediate in the

Discussion
A major objective of this continuing study was to under-
stand the effects of restoration treatments on pre-settle-
ment ponderosa pines at GPNA 7 years after initial
treatment. We compared physiological responses of pre-
settlement trees between earlier studies conducted in
19941996 (Feeney et al. 1998; Stone et al. 1999) and our
study in 2000, 7 years after thinning. Of the years included
in earlier studies, 1996 was most comparable to 2000
because both were characterized by significant drought.
Precipitation between January and June near the study
site was 60% lower than the long-term average in 1996
and 73% lower in 2000.
PWP of pre-settlement trees at the GPNA was consis-
tently lower in the control compared with the thinned and
thinned-and-burned treatments in 1996, 3 years after thin-
ning (Feeney et al. 1998). This was also true in our study in
2000. These findings indicate that the 1993 thinning, which
removed over 90% of post-settlement trees, continued to
increase water uptake of pre-settlement trees 7 years after
thinning despite a large increase of herbaceous plants
within
the

plots

University, unpublished data). Stomatal conductance often
varies with PWP of pre-settlement ponderosa pines in
northern Arizona (Kolb & Stone 2000). However stomatal
conductance did not differ significantly among treatments
in 1996 (Feeney et al. 1998), whereas it was consistently
greater in both the thinned treatments compared with
the control in 2000. Thus effects of the thinning treatments
on stomatal aperture of pre-settlement trees at GPNA
appear to be greater 7 years after treatment compared
with 3 years after treatment.
In 1996 foliar nitrogen concentration on a leaf area basis
was lower for 1-year-old leaves of pre-settlement trees in
the control compared with both the thinned treatments,
and nitrogen concentration on a leaf mass basis was similar
among treatments (Feeney et al. 1998). In 2000 leaf
nitrogen concentration on a leaf area basis was lower in
the control compared with the thinned treatments for
current-year, 1-, and 2-year-old leaves. Current and 1-year-
old leaves in 2000 in the control plots also had lower leaf
nitrogen concentration on a mass basis than trees in the
thinned treatments. Thus the 1993 thinning of post-settle-
ment trees continued to increase nitrogen concentration in
leaves of pre-settlement trees 7 years after treatment.
Differences in leaf nitrogen concentration between
thinned and thinned-and-burned treatments occurred in
both 1996 and 2000, but in a different pattern. In 1996,
the second growing season after the first prescribed fire,
leaf nitrogen concentration on a mass basis was greater in
the thinned-and-burned treatment than in thinned treat-
ment; concentrations were similar on a leaf area basis
(Feeney et al. 1998). In 2000, the second growing season
after the second prescribed fire, leaf nitrogen concentra-
tion was greater in the thinned treatment than the thinned-
and-burned treatment based on both mass and area. There
are several factors that may have influenced the change in
rank of leaf nitrogen concentration between burned and
unburned thinned treatments between 1996 and 2000. First
the 1994 prescribed fire was the first fire in the GPNA
since 1876. Trees in the thinned-and-burned treatment
may have been especially responsive to the pulse of plant-
available nitrogen produced by the 1994 fire (Covington &
Sackett 1986, 1992) considering the slow rate of nitrogen
cycling that characterized the GPNA in the absence of
ecological restoration treatments (Kaye & Hart 1998a).
This pulse may have been short, as Kaye and Hart
(1998a) reported no effect of the 1994 fire at GPNA on
nitrogen mineralization between May and October 1995.
Second the negative impact of the 1998 prescribed fire on
leaf nitrogen concentration of pre-settlement trees com-
pared with the thinned-only treatment may reflect losses of
nitrogen from the site due to volatilization. Repeated pre-
scribed burning of ponderosa pine forests can negatively
influence nitrogen cycling (Wright & Hart 1997). Alter-
natively nitrogen transformation rates at our study site are
positively associated with grass cover (Kaye & Hart
1998a), and there is evidence of less grass cover in
thinned-and-burned compared with thinned plots at our
study site (Covington et al. 1997; M. M. Moore, School of
Forestry, Northern Arizona University, unpublished data).
Thus differences in grass cover between burned and
unburned thinned treatments may have indirectly affected
leaf nitrogen concentration of pre-settlement trees at
GPNA in 2000.

Net photosynthetic rate of pre-settlement trees in 1996
was lower in the control compared with both thinned
treatments in May and June when water stress was most
severe, whereas rates were similar among treatments at
other times of the growing season (Feeney et al. 1998).
Lower leaf nitrogen concentration in 2000 of pre-settle-
ment trees in the control compared with both thinned
treatments suggests lower photosynthetic capacity of
trees in the control, as leaf nitrogen concentration is a
good indicator of maximum photosynthetic rate (Field &
Mooney 1986). However our measurements of mid-day net
photosynthetic rate on two dates in 2000 (June and
August) failed to show such a difference. Evidence from
other measurements suggests lower net photosynthetic
rate in the control than in the thinned treatments in 2000.
For example, leaf internal CO2 concentration was lower
for pre-settlement trees in the thinned treatments com-
pared with the control despite higher supply of CO2 into
the stomatal cavity, as indicated by greater stomatal con-
ductance in the thinned treatments. We speculate that the
lower leaf internal CO2 concentration in the thinned treat-
ments was caused by greater net photosynthetic rate driven
by higher concentrations of photosynthetic enzymes, as
implied by higher leaf nitrogen concentration (Field &
Mooney 1986) in the thinned treatments. The leaf 13C
results also are consistent with this explanation. Leaf
13C, a time-integrated measure of the ratio between
photosynthesis and stomatal conductance (Ehleringer et
al. 1993), did not differ among treatments in any year
(19982000). However stomatal conductance was higher
in both thinned treatments than the control in both June
and August 2000. An explanation for these results is that
both
photosynthesis
and
stomatal
conductance
were
greater in the thinned treatments than the control over
major portions of the 2000 growing season, which resulted
in a similar ratio of photosynthesis to stomatal conduc-
tance and thus similar 13C for all treatments.
If the above explanation is correct, why did our meas-
urements of mid-day net photosynthetic rate not differ
among treatments in 2000? MMWP and MWP of pre-
settlement trees in June and August 2000 in all treatments
were between about 22.0 and 22.4 MPa, which is below
the threshold value of about 21.8 MPa reported to reduce
stomatal conductance and net photosynthetic rate of pre-
settlement age ponderosa pine in northern Arizona (Kolb
& Stone 2000). In contrast, mid-day tree water potential
was greater than 22.0 MPa for pre-settlement trees in all
treatments in 1996 when significant differences in June net
photosynthetic rate were reported (Feeney et al. 1998).
Interestingly, leaf 13C was much greater in 2000 than
1999 and 1998, suggesting low stomatal conductance inte-
grated over the growing season in 2000. Thus severe water
stress in 2000 likely reduced our ability to detect treatment
effects on net photosynthetic rate measured at mid-day.
Resin flow in response to wounding, a key defense of
conifers against bark beetles (Smith 1975; Raffa & Berryman
1982, 1983; Wallin & Raffa 2001), was higher in June
1996 in pre-settlement trees in the thinned-and-burned
treatment compared with both the thinned treatment and
the control (Feeney et al. 1998). The factors causing higher
resin flow in the thinned-and-burned treatment in 1996 are
not completely understood, but may include stimulation of
resin production in response to wounding of cambium or
phloem by the fire (Ruel et al. 1998), or differences in
resource availability or carbon allocation to resin produc-
tion among treatments. Treatment differences in resin flow
in June 2000 followed the same pattern as reported for
June 1996. In contrast the pattern of treatment differences
in resin flow in August 2000 differed from June 2000.
Resin flow in the control was lowest among treatments in
June, but was highest among all treatments in August. The
relationship between growth and defense (Lorio 1986;
Herms & Mattson 1992; Wallin & Raffa 2001) may explain
this result. Radial growth of pre-settlement trees at the
GPNA was slower in the control compared with the
thinned and thinned-and-burned treatments (Feeney et al.
1998). Radial growth of ponderosa pine in northern
Arizona typically peaks in June and declines from July to
September (Pearson 1924; Schubert 1974). Lower use of
carbon for diameter growth later in the season may
account for the increase in carbon available for resin pro-
duction in August in all treatments, and especially in the
control where carbon use for radial growth is low.
Our finding that resin volume of pre-settlement trees in
the control can be as great as volume of trees in the
thinned treatments suggests that temporal variation in
the effects of restoration treatments on resin defenses
should be considered regarding tree susceptibility to bark
beetles. Given that resin flow is considered an important
component of tree susceptibility to bark beetles (Smith
1975; Raffa & Berryman 1982, 1983), our results suggest
that trees in the control were more susceptible in June, but
less susceptible in August, relative to trees in the thinned-
and-burned treatment. Further research on effects of for-
est restoration and management treatments on ponderosa
pine susceptibility to bark beetles should include temporal
variation in resin defenses, as well as better information on
temporal variation in bark beetle flights which is virtually
unknown in northern Arizona.
Our results for leaf toughness, a measure of ponderosa
pine resistance against sawflies (McMillin & Wagner 1993;
Wagner & Zhang 1993), were similar in 1996 (Feeney et al.
1998) and 2000. In both years, toughness of pre-settlement
trees was lowest in the control, intermediate in the
thinned-and-burned treatment, and highest in the thinned
treatment (Feeney et al. 1998). Thus treatment effects on
leaf toughness have not changed between 3 and 7 years
after thinning.
In

several
beneficial
effects
of
thinning
restoration treatments (higher PWP, higher stomatal con-
ductance, higher leaf nitrogen concentration, and tougher
foliage) on pre-settlement trees at the GPNA continue to
be expressed 7 years after thinning under drought condi-
tions in 2000. We found no clear evidence to support a

change in the magnitude of these effects between 3 (1996)
and 7 (2000) years after thinning. Thus increased use of
soil resources by herbaceous plants in thinned treatments
(Covington et al. 1997; M. M. Moore, School of Forestry,
Northern Arizona University, unpublished data) does not
appear to be having strong negative effects on resource
availability to pre-settlement trees. However we did find
evidence that two low-intensity prescribed burns 4 years
apart in thinned plots reduced leaf nitrogen concentration,
indicating that burning effects on soil nitrogen transforma-
tions and plant uptake should be studied further in resto-
ration experiments. Finally responses of resin defenses of
pre-settlement trees at GPNA to restoration treatments
were not consistent between early- and late-summer meas-
urements, which raises the possibility that treatment
effects on tree susceptibility to bark beetles are more
complex than suggested by earlier research (Feeney et al.
1998).
