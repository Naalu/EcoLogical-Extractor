Abstract
Collaboration is increasingly emphasized as a tool to realize national-level policy goals in public lands 
management. Yet, collaborative governance regimes (CGRs) are nested within traditional bureaucracies 
and are affected by internal and external disruptions. The extent to which CGRs adapt and remain re­
silient to these disruptions remains under-explored. Here, we distill insights from an assessment of the 
Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) projects and other CGRs. We asked (1) how 
do CGRs adapt to disruptions? and (2) what barriers constrained CGR resilience? Our analysis is informed 
by a synthesis of the literature, case examples and exemplars from focus groups, and a national CFLRP 
survey. CGRs demonstrated the ability to mobilize social capital, learning, resources, and flexibility to re­
spond to disruptions. Yet authority, accountability, and capacity complicated collaborative resilience. We 
conclude with policy and practice recommendations to cultivate collaborative resilience moving forward.
Study Implications: Collaborative approaches between public lands management agencies and 
nongovernment organizations have become common in forest restoration. Yet collaborative pro­
gress may be affected by turnover, wildfire disturbances, or legal or policy changes. We assessed 
how forest collaboratives in the United States adapted to changes that affected their performance and 
documented the factors that constrained response. We found that forest collaboratives developed 
myriad strategies to adapt to these changes, although limited authority, capacity, and accountability 
constrain adaptation options. We offer policy and practice recommendations to overcome these con­
straints, increase adaptation options, and enhance the sustainability of forest collaboratives.

Restoration Program (CFLRP), for example, was es­
tablished under the Forest Landscape Restoration Act 
in 2009, the purpose of which was to encourage the 
collaborative, science-based ecosystem restoration of 
priority landscapes on Forest Service-managed lands 
(Schultz et al. 2012). Projects were required to be de­
veloped and implemented collaboratively throughout 
planning, implementation, and monitoring (Butler 
and Schultz 2019a). The CFLRP was innovative in 
that it mandated collaboration and provided a mech­
anism for sustained funding (Schultz et  al. 2012). It 
has also provided multiple opportunities for research 
that assessed the social and ecological outcomes of 
projects in unique places and contexts under the same 
policy instrument (Butler and Schultz 2019a). There is 
increasing evidence that collaborative approaches have 
supported restoration outcomes that approximate de­
sired conditions (Cannon et  al. 2018, Barrett et  al. 
2021); increased planning efficiency, acres treated, 
and diversity of accomplishments (McIver and Becker 
2021); increased trust and capacity to accomplish 
work on the ground while reducing conflict and liti­
gation (McIntyre and Schultz 2020); and facilitated 
creative solutions to complex landscape scale manage­
ment issues (Butler and Schultz 2019a).
Although evidence of the benefits of collabor­
ation in publicly managed forest contexts continues 
to grow, less is known about how collaborative gov­
ernance regimes (CGRs) adapt and remain resilient 
to disruptions that occur internally or among the 
social and environmental settings in which they are 
embedded (Cheng et  al. 2015, Butler and Schultz 
2019b). This paper seeks to address this gap. Our 
analysis is informed by the following research 
questions:
	1.	 What are the ways in which CGRs adapted to 
common disruptions, specifically personnel turn­
over, biophysical disturbances, legal challenges, or 
policy changes, that impacted their collaborative 
progress and performance? and
	2.	 What barriers constrained CGR adaptation?
We assessed these questions within the con­
text of CFLRP and other public forest restoration 
collaboratives across the United States. We reviewed 
and synthesized literature on the adaptability of 
CFLRP projects and joined this review with examples 
from focus groups and a survey. We argue that whereas 
CGRs may demonstrate adaptability to myriad disrup­
tions, there are persistent barriers that diminish CGR 
resilience.
Conceptual Framework
The conceptual model in Figure 1 illustrates the factors 
that affect CGR resilience—a system’s ability to buffer 
disturbance and adapt to social and environmental 
change without losing desired structure, function, and 
feedbacks—across scales (Walker et al. 2004). System 
context refers to the social, political, economic, and 
ecological conditions in which CGRs are embedded. 
Disruptions among the system context or internal 
CGR changes, including biophysical disturbances (e.g., 
wildfire), policy changes (e.g., funding), or legal chal­
lenges (e.g., litigation) can affect collaborative progress 
and performance, thus forcing CGRs to adapt (Ostrom 
2009, Emerson et  al. 2012, Moseley and Charnley 
2014).
CGR refers to “public policy or service-oriented, 
cross-organizational systems involving a range of au­
tonomous organizations representing different inter­
ests and/or jurisdictions” (Emerson and Gerlak 2014, 
769). Within the CGR, there are two components of 
the adaptation process—adaptive capacity (i.e., the 
preconditions necessary to prepare for and respond 
to social or environmental change) and the mobiliza­
tion of those capacities to take adaptive actions (Smit 
and Wandel 2006, Nelson et al. 2007, Emerson and 
Gerlak 2014). Internal or external barriers can im­
pede the adaptation process (Moser and Ekstrom 
2010, Biesbroek et al. 2013). Adaptive capacities, ac­
tions, and barriers collectively determine whether de­
sired outcomes are met and the extent to which CGRs 
are resilient (Turner et al. 2003, Emerson and Gerlak 
2014; Figure 1).
To promote collaborative resilience to disruptions, 
CGRs must enhance their adaptive capacity (Walker 
et al. 2004, Folke et al. 2010). Our review of the col­
laborative and adaptive governance literature iden­
tified several key factors or determinants that affect 
adaptive capacity and adaptive actions within CGRs, 
including social capital, learning, flexibility, and re­
sources (See Folke et al. 2005, Gupta et al. 2010, Hill 
2013, Emerson and Gerlak 2014). These constructs 
were selected due to their prominence in the literature 
on CGRs engaged in collaborative restoration of pub­
licly managed forests and the CFLRP in particular.
Social capital is the networks, norms, rules, and 
trust that promote collective action (Pelling and High 
2005). It is considered the “glue” of adaptive cap­
acity and is built through investments in social rela­
tionships (Folke et al. 2005). Networks are considered 
more adaptable when they are redundant, they include 
a diversity of interests, perspectives, and knowledge,

and when formal and informal arrangements are 
connected within groups (bonding capital), across 
groups (bridging capital), and across levels of au­
thority (linking capital) (Folke et al. 2005, Pelling and 
High 2005, Gupta et al. 2010). Robust social capital 
can promote resource exchange, flexibility, and social 
learning (Pahl-Wostl 2009, Engle and Lemos 2010, 
Koontz et al. 2015, Cinner et al. 2018, Sharma-Wallace 
et al. 2018). Social capital is an important precondi­
tion for adaptive capacity, because without it, CGRs 
may struggle to effectively collaborate. For example, in 
collaborative restoration of publicly managed forests, 
turnover among agency and collaborative members 
that support the CGR can slow progress, undermine 
trust and relationship-building, or result in lost insti­
tutional knowledge or collaborative vision (Cheng 
et al. 2015, McIntyre and Schultz 2020, Coleman et al. 
2021, Santo et al. 2021).
Learning is a key component of adaptive capacity 
(Folke et  al. 2005, Berkes 2009, Pahl-Wostl 2009, 
Gupta et  al. 2010). Social learning occurs through 
repeated interactions and joint problem solving among 
participants; it both enhances, and is influenced by, 
social capital (Fernandez-Gimenez et al. 2008, Berkes 
2009, Lebel et al. 2010). It emphasizes testing, moni­
toring, and reevaluating participants’ held beliefs and 
understandings to coproduce knowledge of ecosystem 
dynamics, trends, and feedbacks to learn from and 
adapt to change (Folke et al. 2005, Lebel et al. 2010, 
Sharma-Wallace et  al. 2018). Social learning can re­
duce conflicts and increase shared understanding, ac­
tion, and trust (Fernandez-Gimenez et al. 2008, Lebel 
et al. 2010). Within forest management–focused CGRs, 
learning is an important mechanism of collaboration. 
For example, field trips and joint fact-finding are con­
sidered key learning tools (Butler et al. 2015, Urgenson 
et al. 2017).
Adaptive CGRs have the flexibility to improvise 
and deploy alternative adaptation strategies (Engle and 
Lemos 2010, Gupta et al. 2010, Cinner et al. 2018). 
Multilevel social networks are thought to increase 
flexibility as diverse actors and organizations offer a 
Figure 1.  Conceptual model of the forces and factors that affect adaptation and resilience of collaborative governance 
regimes (CGR). CGRs are nested within the broader system context. Disruptions in the system context as well as internal 
disruptions can combine to expose collaboratives to potential vulnerabilities (and opportunities) that forces groups to 
adapt. The adaptation process is dependent on inherent adaptive capacities of CGRs (social capital, learning, flexibility, 
and resources) and the mobilization of those capacities leading to adaptive actions. Adaptive actions can also feedback 
to affect and build adaptive capacity. Institutional and structural barriers act as impediments to the adaptation process. 
The combination of adaptive capacities, adaptive actions, and barriers determines the extent to which desired outcomes 
are met on the ground and the resilience of CGRs to ongoing and future disruptions, which may extend outside the CGR.

diversity of authority, capacity, and solutions (Folke 
et al. 2005, Gupta et al. 2010). Robust structures and 
processes for learning allow CGRs to experiment with 
novel solutions and flexibly respond to known and 
unknown disruptions (Folke et al. 2005, Gupta et al. 
2010, Koontz et al. 2015, Cinner et al. 2018). In the 
context of collaborative forest management, flexibility 
is incumbent due to frequently changing conditions on 
the ground (Spaeth 2014).
Resource availability is a key determinant of adap­
tive capacity (Smit and Pilifosova 2003, Eakin and 
Lemos 2006, Gupta et al. 2010, Emerson and Gerlak 
2014). A benefit of CGRs is the ability to share and 
mobilize resources beyond a single organization’s cap­
acity. Shared resources can include funding, human 
capital, legal assistance, technical or scientific ex­
pertise, logistical or administrative coordination, fa­
cilitation, or power (Emerson and Gerlak 2014). This 
is often supported by boundary-spanning individuals 
or organizations, including community champions, 
third-party facilitators or coordinators, and research 
organizations (Folke et  al. 2005, Hahn et  al. 2006, 
Berkes 2009, Cheng et al. 2015, Coleman et al. 2017). 
In the context of the CFLRP, sharing resources is fun­
damental to the policy itself, and the Forest Service 
must leverage partner funds in addition to the funding 
received through the CFLRP.
Adaptive actions specific to CGRs may include 
changes in procedural rules or mandates, new parti­
cipants, changes to the collaborative scope or mission, 
or the development or revision of a charter or mission 
(Emerson and Gerlak 2014). Adaptive actions may also 
support capacity-building (Nelson et al. 2007, Hill and 
Engle 2015). For example, field trips and informal so­
cial interactions can enhance trust and social learning 
(Wondolleck and Yaffee 2000; Figure 1). Boundary 
objects can absorb the social capital and learning de­
veloped by CGRs (Cash et  al. 2003, 2006, Feldman 
et al. 2006, Cheng et al. 2015). Boundary objects are 
tangible items (e.g., models, assessment reports, imple­
mentation guidelines, or contracts) that exist between 
actors or organizations to facilitate group actions and 
interactions (Mollinga 2010, Star 2010) and help de­
velop and codify shared understanding and transpar­
ency in decision-making (Cash et al. 2003, Mollinga 
2010, White et al. 2010, Cheng et al. 2015, Westerink 
et al. 2020).
Institutional and structural barriers include limited 
coordination within and between organizations, inflex­
ible policies and procedures, limited resources to plan 
and adapt to change, conflicting goals and missions, lack 
of leadership, or limited authority to act (Wondolleck 
and Yaffee 2000, Moote and Becker 2003, Margerum 
2007, Bierbaum et al. 2013, McNamara et al. 2020). 
Barriers may manifest from within or outside the CGR 
and can undermine social learning processes and trust-
building, stifle flexibility, and impede actions (Walker 
and Hurley 2004, Moser and Ekstrom 2010, Gerlak 
and Heikkila 2011, Munaretto and Huitema 2012, 
Abrams et al. 2017) (Figure 1). CGRs are nested within 
and do not replace traditional bureaucratic institutions 
(Agranoff 2006, Kettl 2006). The Forest Service still re­
tains decision-making authority over management ac­
tions, and thus can restrict the latitude for adaptation 
(Nie 2004, Abrams et al. 2017).
Methods
Data Collection
We addressed our research questions using a literature 
review and synthesis of the CFLRP literature on adapt­
ability and barriers, case examples and exemplars from 
focus groups, and a CFLRP survey. The literature review 
was carried out in two phases following systematic re­
view and mapping principles to enhance transparency 
and reproducibility (James et al. 2016, Haddaway et al. 
2016). Table 1 depicts the search sources, search terms 
or criteria used, and the number of retrieved documents 
for each phase. In phase 1, we reanalyzed a dataset the 
authors collected to support the Forest Service in their 
CFLRP results and lessons-learned summary series 
(Beeton et al. 2020). This included a review of peer-
reviewed and grey literature from the CFLRP Resource 
Library1 and an edited volume on collaborative govern­
ance dynamics in CFLRP projects (Butler and Schultz 
2019a). We compiled documents in the CFLRP Resource 
Library and “chased” relevant documents cited in the 
Resource Library for additional review (Jahangirian 
et  al. 2011). Recognizing that the CFLRP Resource 
Library is not a comprehensive resource for CFLRP lit­
erature, we conducted an additional review in Proquest 
(n = 209) and Google Scholar (n = 646—we reviewed 
the first two hundred entries, a common practice in sys­
tematic reviews) (Haddaway et al. 2015). In sum, the 
initial search yielded 474 documents for screening.
The exclusion process is illustrated in Figure 2. We 
first removed duplicates, then documents for which 
full texts were not available, as well as press releases, 
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documents, 
book reviews, and presentations. Next, we surveyed 
document titles and abstracts to determine whether 
the document (1) focused on a CFLRP CGR and (2)

addressed our research questions. In cases where we 
were unable to determine this from the title or abstract, 
we skimmed the methods and results sections and 
used the advanced search function in Acrobat Pro DC 
using key word searches for a variety of terms related 
to our research questions and conceptual framework, 
including: “CFLRP;” “governance;” “collaboration;” 
“adapt;” “barrier;” “flexibility;” “learning;” “turnover;” 
“beetle;” and “wildfire” among others. Finally, we ex­
cluded documents that provided no new empirical data, 
which resulted in a total of 64 documents that were in­
cluded in our analysis (Supplement 1). A list of docu­
ments that were reviewed but ultimately excluded from 
analysis are included in Supplement 2.
We coupled this literature synthesis with case ex­
amples and exemplars from focus groups and a 
CFLRP survey on collaborative progress and perform­
ance. Focus groups were conveniently sampled at two 
forest collaborative workshops, the 2020 Southwest 
Ecological Restoration Institutes (SWERI) Cross-
Boundary Landscape Restoration Workshop and the 
2020 Idaho Forest Restoration Partnership Expanding 
Shared Stewardship workshop. Participants discussed 
changes their collaborative had experienced, adapta­
tions, and barriers to adaptation (Supplement 3). Notes 
from focus groups were analyzed (n = 7) as were re­
sponses from participants who volunteered to fill out a 
questionnaire on these topics (n = 45). We also analyzed 
a subset of responses from the CFLRP Collaboration 
Indicator Survey2 administered by the National Forest 
Foundation in January 2020 to participants of the 
23 CFLR projects (Figure 3), including collaborative 
participants and Forest Service staff. We analyzed re­
sponses to the open-ended questions addressing adap­
tations (n  =  60), barriers to response (n  =  49), and 
regional office effects on CFLRP performance (n = 59). 
Representatives from three CFLRPs did not answer 
these voluntary survey questions (Kootenai Valley 
Resource Initiative, Shortleaf Bluestem Community, 
Selway-Middle Fork Clearwater).
Data Analysis
Each data source was analyzed in Atlas.ti using a 
modified grounded theory approach. Grounded 
theory is a process for analyzing qualitative data 
through an iterative, inductive process of coding, 
memoing, and constant comparison (Glaser and 
Strauss 1967). Modified grounded theory uses the 
same guidelines for analysis but is neither purely in­
ductive nor deductive (Charmaz 2006, 2011). Codes 
are derived inductively from analysis of data, as is the 
case with a grounded theory assessment, although 
the modified approach leaves room to situate the 
analysis within broader literature and theory (Mills 
et al. 2006, Thornberg 2012).
We derived a priori codes from the concepts 
introduced in the conceptual framework and Figure

actions, barriers) to guide initial coding and ana­
lysis and also derived codes inductively to ground 
our findings in the data. We situated our analysis on 
adaptations to common disruptions (personnel turn­
over, biophysical disturbance [specifically wildfire 
and pest or pathogen disturbances], legal challenges, 
or policy changes) and adaptation barriers. This as­
sessment attempts to synthesize and report on some 
of the common responses and barriers that CGRs 
experienced and reported. As such, we hope the as­
sessment may provide a menu of adaptation options 
for practitioners to consider.
Results
Adaptations to Turnover
CGRs employed several strategies to adapt to turnover, 
including (1) codeveloping boundary objects to articu­
late collaborative vision, procedures, and agreements; 
(2) onboarding processes; and (3) spanning levels of 
agency authority to maintain collaborative philosophy 
(Table 2).
Codeveloping Boundary Objects to 
Articulate 
Collaborative Vision, Procedures, and Agreements
CGRs developed boundary objects, such as char­
ters and memorandums of understanding or 
agreement, to articulate their collaborative vi­
sion, procedures, and expectations between col­
laborative members and among the Forest Service. 
Although ­these ­typically were not developed solely 
to manage ­turnover, the literature and respond­
ents considered them, and the processes used to 
create them, imperative for absorbing institutional 
memory and learning and for facilitating transpar­
ency and accountability following turnover (Cheng 
et al. 2019, Stern and Coleman 2019, USDA Forest 
Service 2021). As one respondent from the SWERI 
workshop noted,
if you have strong collaborative structure you 
shouldn’t have to deal with this [turnover] because 
the expectations are clearly laid out in foundational 
documents.3

We reviewed the first 200 entries in Google Scholar, a common practice in systematic reviews and for secondary search

CGRs that formally developed and periodically re­
visited documents depicting operational rules and pro­
cedures that govern behavior, often through the use of 
a facilitator or coordinator to help develop and enforce 
them, adapted to turnover quicker and more efficiently 
than CGRs that did not (Coleman and Stern 2018, 
Stern and Coleman 2019). In some cases, hand-over 
memos were used to inform new personnel of expect­
ations and commitments (Schultz et  al. 2018, Butler 
and Schultz 2019b).
Similarly, many CGRs have developed boundary 
objects for institutionalizing collaborative agreements 
regarding the principles of restoration and on-the-
ground implementation activities (Cheng et al. 2015). 
For example, the Southern Blues Restoration Coalition 
created “decision trees,” which delineated zones of 
agreement on the type, extent, and location of treat­
ments and identified individuals to contact when issues 
arose (Antuma et  al. 2014). A  respondent from the 
Colorado Front Range CFLRP noted that General 
Technical Report (GTR) 373, which was collabora­
tively produced by the Colorado Front Range CFLRP, 
forest managers, scientists from the Rocky Mountain 
Research Station and Colorado Forest Restoration 
Institute, and environmental groups, helped articulate 
the CGR’s vision for restoration following turnover.4 
Documenting field trips, meetings, and other collab­
orative engagements, along with personnel to manage, 
and websites to house, boundary objects helped to 
enhance transparency and onboard new  personnel 
(Antuma et al. 2014, USDA Forest Service 2021).
Onboarding Processes
Several documents and respondents emphasized the 
importance of onboarding processes for adapting to 
turnover. Redundant, overlapping positions and re­
sponsibilities helped buffer impacts from turnover. In 
the Burney-Hat Creek Basins CFLRP, multiple Forest 
Service staff participated in meetings to maintain 
continuity in the event of turnover and ensure broad 
agency understanding of collaborative expectations 
(USDA Forest Service 2021). Some CGRs required 
members to serve as alternates on leadership com­
mittees or as vice-chairs prior to serving the acting 
role. Others established formal mentoring procedures 
wherein outgoing members recruited and trained their

replacement (Coleman et al. 2021). Although not fi­
nancially efficient, creating redundancy in positions, 
even for a short time, can help new members build 
trust and better understand group norms, thereby 
easing the transition (Stern and Coleman 2019, 
Coleman et al. 2021). The Southern Blues Restoration 
Coalition and Kootenai Valley Resource Initiative 
hosted regular workshops or meetings to onboard 
new employees (Antuma et  al. 2014, USDA Forest 
Service 2018, 2021). Respondents noted that changes 
in participant membership shifted from meeting to 
meeting. CGRs responded by spending more time at 
meetings to revisit rules, procedures, and to tell the 
collaborative story, and emphasized more time in the 
field together. Facilitators and coordinators were in­
strumental in coordinating these workshops and ac­
tivities and (re)focusing the collaborative following 
transition (Moote 2013, USDA Forest Service 2018, 
Butler and Schultz 2019a, b Cheng et al. 2019).5
Spanning Levels of Agency Authority to Maintain 
Collaborative Philosophy
The decision to engage with CGRs is often up to 
individual personnel in the Forest Service. When 
agency personnel transitioned to another forest or 
position, CGRs sought support from agency lead­
ership to ensure new personnel were aware of and 
committed to the project. This meant putting pres­
sure on the Forest Service at the unit and regional 
levels to align with collaborative priorities. In at 
least one instance, CGR members were involved 
in hiring for leadership positions (National Forest 
Foundation 2016). Often, vacant positions are not 
immediately filled after personnel transfer; thus, 
CGRs pressured leadership to fill vacancies and re­
tain dedicated personnel:
The group continued to pressure the [USDA] Forest

were vacated or to find ways to ensure longer-term

We documented three adaptations to biophysical dis­
turbance: (1) flexible institutions and arrangements, 
(2) living with and learning from disturbance, and (3) 
maintaining agency support for restoration goals fol­

Flexible Institutions and Arrangements
CGRs demonstrated flexibility in responding to biophys­
ical disturbances by altering treatment types, planning 
units, timelines, and priorities. Several CGRs developed 
agreements for salvage projects. For example, the 2012 
Barry Point fire burned four years of “NEPA-ready” res­
toration projects for the Lakeview Stewardship Landscape. 
The group subsequently agreed to salvage operations that 
limited undesirable ecological effects and provided eco­
nomic recovery. The group also identified a new planning 
unit and agreed on changes to CFLRP funding timelines, 
scheduling, and funding for reforestation (Spaeth 2014).
CGRs used innovative programs, authorities, and 
partnerships to address the increased scale of in­
sect disturbance. CGRs in Colorado, Montana, and 
Washington used the CFLRP and the Joint Chiefs’ 
Landscape Restoration Partnership to fund landscape-
scale restoration in areas affected by the mountain pine 
beetle epidemic (Abrams et  al. 2021). Some groups 
used other authorities or agreements with their net­
works, as one respondent noted:
We needed to do something and got all hands-on 
deck approval. This has led to several formal agree­
ments (Good Neighbor Authority, water providers, 
private, etc.), which has resulted in accelerated work.7
Living with and Learning from Disturbance 
to Inform Future Actions
Biophysical disturbances supported learning about disturb­
ance effects, restoration priorities, and ecological effects of 
alternative restoration strategies. The 2015 Canyon Creek 
Complex fire brought forward recurring tensions between 
timber-dependent communities surrounding the Malheur 
National Forest in Oregon and environmental groups 
around balancing salvage logging for economic recovery 
and maintaining habitat for woodpecker species of con­
servation concern. The Blue Mountain Forest Partners, 
Malheur National Forest, and Rocky Mountain Research 
Station embarked on a four year experimental study to 
monitor woodpecker response to alternative harvest treat­
ments. Partners used a geographic information systems 
(GIS) tool called FIRE-BIRD to inform transparent salvage 
prescription decisions that maintain woodpecker viability 
(Watts 2019). CGR members were involved in the study 
from conception, thus providing a sense of ownership of 
the data and legitimacy of the results, as exemplified by 
one respondent:
[This project will lead to] improved trust, and will 
give us real data to see if env[ironmental] concerns 
are real. [It] gave us a project that we feel invested 
in seeing to the end. Everyone is looking at the same 
science because we helped design the study.8
Field trips further supported learning about disturb­
ance impacts, the need for restoration, and ecological 
effects of management alternatives.
Maintaining Agency Support for Restoration Goals
Strong working relationships with Forest Service per­
sonnel helped CGRs maintain support for collabora­
tive restoration goals following disturbance:

Journal of Forestry, 2022, Vol. XX, No. XX
We made it clear that the work planned prior to the 
large fire was still a priority and the USFS has since 
continued to push that restoration work forward.9
Strong relationships with the Forest Service enabled 
CGRs to weigh in on postdisturbance proposed man­
agement actions. For example, the Payette Forest 
Coalition drafted a letter to the forest supervisor to 
ensure treatment objectives for the proposed action 
aligned with their priorities.10
Adaptations to Legal Challenges or 
Policy Change
CGRs adapted to legal challenges or policy changes 
through (1) flexible practices, processes, and oper­
ations; (2) collaborative learning; and (3) engaging ob­
jectors and intervening in court (Table 4).
Flexible Practices, Processes, and Operations
CGRs developed multilevel collaboratives to match 
the scale of governance to the landscape-scale restor­
ation requirements of the CFLRP. For example, the 
Southwestern Crown Collaborative linked three na­
tional forests, several community-based watershed 
groups, environmental groups, and research scientists, 
and the Deschutes Skyline project developed a “super-
collaborative” that linked two existing CGRs (Tabor 
et al. 2014, Monroe and Butler 2016).
Some groups were challenged on alleged Federal 
Advisory 
Committee 
Act 
(FACA) 
violations. 
A collaborative group must be authorized as an FACA 
committee if a federal agency establishes and controls 
the group, it consists of nonfederal entities, and it pro­
vides collective advice to the federal agency (Butler 
2013). Hence, CGRs adjusted how Forest Service staff 
participated in the collaborative process to eliminate 
any real or perceived collusion. The Southwestern 
Crown Collaborative, for example, revised their struc­
ture and removed Forest Service personnel from lead­
ership positions to ensure compliance (Butler 2013, 
Monroe and Butler 2016).
CGRs invited participation from litigious parties and 
participants who were historically absent from collabora­
tive engagement to improve support for recommended 
actions (Antuma et al. 2014, Monroe and Butler 2016, 
Urgenson et al. 2017, Walpole et al. 2017, McIntyre and 
Schultz 2020). Diverse representation early in the process 
helped avoid conflict later, and even when groups didn't 
participate, inviting them early in the process often eased 
conflict and increased support for decisions (Bothwell 
2019, Urgenson et al. 2017). As with turnover, inviting 
formerly litigious groups or conflicting parties was me­
diated by established rules and procedures that governed 
behavior and dedicated facilitators (Walpole et al. 2017).
The Mexican-spotted owl injunction in the 
Southwestern region (Figure 1) halted all timber 
management activities on five national forests in 
New Mexico and one in Arizona in 2020. This forced 
CGRs to be flexible and engage with networks across

boundaries to keep restoration work going and mills 
running during and post-injunction. The Forest 
Stewards Guild Youth Corps and Zuni Mountain 
CFLRP worked with private landowners and the 
State of New Mexico for administrative clearance to 
conduct prescribed burns on private lands. As one 
member remarked:
We proved the value of our youth fire crew and the 
program’s ability to be nimble [and] we now have 
a strategy and precedent to deal with similar prob­
lems [in the future].11
Collaborative Learning
Many CGRs engaged in collaborative learning and 
fact-finding to reduce conflict and litigation. In the 
Sierra National Forest, restoration projects were em­
broiled in conflict and litigation for several years due to 
concerns regarding habitat suitability of Pacific fisher 
(Martes pennanti). The Dinkey Landscape Restoration 
project used GTR-220 (North et al. 2009) to reach con­
sensus among conflicting parties around the purpose, 
need, and approach for restoration in fisher habitat 
(Bartlett 2012, Moote 2013). Subsequently, the group 
codeveloped tree marking guidelines and ladder fuels 
management strategies in Pacific fisher and spotted 
owl habitats, deployed a field monitoring program, 
and hosted field trips to support learning and engage­
ment (Moote 2013, Butler et al. 2015, Christenson and 
Butler 2019). The marking guidelines were adopted by 
the Forest Service to inform silvicultural prescriptions 
and implementation decisions (Moote 2013). Further, 
agreed-upon science carried out by the Tall Timbers 
Research Station and Land Conservancy in Florida, 
combined with trust in the ecological condition model 
for informing decisions has helped deter litigation in 
the Accelerating Long Leaf Pine Restoration CFLRP 
(Monroe 2015).
The Four Forests Restoration Initiative (4FRI) stake­
holder group spent five years collaborating on the first 
4FRI environmental impact statement (EIS). Although 
the EIS was developed collaboratively, several litigious 
parties declined to contribute, and hence the threat 
of litigation was significant. One approach the stake­
holder group used to stave off objections and litigation 
was to assess the extent to which the draft EIS suffi­
ciently addressed standards and processes commonly 
objected to or litigated. This signaled to those paying 
attention to the CGR but not contributing that the EIS 
was compliant, and although there were nine objec­
tions during the predecisional objection process, those 
were mitigated, and the record of decision was signed 
in 2015 (Vosick 2016).
Engaging Objectors and Intervening in Court
In situations in which litigious groups declined to par­
ticipate, community champions and environmental 
organizations with strong relationships with potential 
litigators acted as intermediaries to find agreement and 
avoid litigation on salvage projects (Antuma et al. 2014, 
Spaeth 2014). CGRs also assisted the Forest Service by 
submitting letters of support for projects, participating 
in the predecisional objection process, and intervening 
in court (Vosick 2016, Schultz et  al. 2017, Bothwell 
2019, McIntyre and Schultz 2020).12
Two 
partners 
of 
the 
Weiser-Little 
Salmon 
Headwaters CGR, Adams County and the American 
Forest Resource Council, served as intervenors on be­
half of the CGR (USDA Forest Service 2021). In other 
cases, CGRs filed amicus briefs on behalf of the agency 
(Schultz et  al. 2017, McIntyre and Schultz 2020).13 
Together, these actions have helped deter litigation, 
reduce the time spent on deliberation and objection 
processes, and signaled to potential litigators that the 
CGR supported the Forest Service.
Barriers
CGRs dealt with the following barriers: (1) agency cul­
ture, commitment, and collaborative incentives; and 
(2) resource constraints.
Agency Culture, Commitment, and Collaborative 
Incentives
The Forest Service has a culture of regularly rotating per­
sonnel (referred to as a “detail”) to provide professional 
development and promotion opportunities. This culture of 
transition, coupled with lag times in filling vacancies, cre­
ated challenges for CGRs, as illustrated by one respondent:
During the last two years, two District Rangers and 
the Forest Supervisor have either retired or moved. It 
took over a year to fill the Forest Supervisor position 
and now one of the new District Rangers is going on 
a detail after one year in her current position. These 
transitions are hard on collaborative groups as they 
must build new relationships and acting adminis­
trators aren’t as empowered to move projects along 
towards implementation. This culture of moving em­
ployees to gain experience and get promoted is killing 
collaboration. It needs to change.14
Rapid turnover also occurred among interdisciplinary 
teams within the timeframe of one project-planning

process (Schultz et al. 2018). This discontinuity under­
mined relationship and trust-building, and thus made 
it difficult to maintain momentum and a shared vision 
and led to lost institutional knowledge (Cheng et al. 
2019, USDA Forest Service 2021).
A lack of commitment to the collaborative process 
among decision-makers in the agency at unit and re­
gional scales was also a significant barrier (Greer 2012, 
Bothwell 2019). The reviewed literature and respond­
ents noted some line officers dismissed collaborative 
input or contradicted recommendations:
The [national forest] mostly stonewalls input from 
[the CGR], including suggestions on how pro­
jects could be changed to better restore ecological 
resilience.15
Bergemann et al. (2019) found differences in line officer 
support for collaboration across Forest Service admin­
istrative units within a single CFLRP project. Similarly, 
respondents reported that some regional offices pro­
vided little support, developed initiatives without col­
laborative input, or were disconnected from CFLRP 
requirements and project-specific needs. Continued 
support garnered through past collaborative engage­
ment was variable following transitions. Although 
some CGRs were successful in maintaining existing 
collaborative restoration agreements vis a vis “zones of 
agreement,” others found that progress derailed as new 
staff were not compelled to adhere to these agreements 
or expectations (Cheng et al. 2019, Christenson and 
Butler 2019, McIntyre 2019). Collaborative commit­
ment varied depending on line officers’ interpretations 
of overlapping laws and regulations, such as FACA, 
or the tension to collaborate throughout the NEPA 
process while maintaining decision-making authority 
(Christenson and Butler 2019, USDA Forest Service 
2021, Egan and Dubay 2013), and individual percep­
tions of the value of collaboration:
Forest Service culture limits the effectiveness of col­
laborative groups because many employees are un­
familiar with collaborative processes or [its] value.16
Agency staff also must adhere to multiple perform­
ance measures to track accomplishments. Yet these 
performance measures are focused on outputs (e.g., 
acres treated), which often do not align with social or 
biophysical outcomes important to CGRs (e.g., treat­
ment effectiveness), or agency targets (e.g., prescribed 
fire) may be more conservative than CGR goals (Butler 
and Schultz 2019b, Cheng et al. 2019, McIntyre 2019). 
Particularly, performance measurements that incen­
tivize collaboration are lacking:
Our current pay scale and organization doesn’t an­
swer to the increased capacity employees are ex­
pected to practice. A forester can do a quarter of 
the work on a different forest [non-CFLRP] and the 
only incentive to stay on the project is experience. 
This model is no longer effective.17
In short, there are no formal mechanisms to hold the 
Forest Service accountable and committed to the col­
laborative process or inputs, which is exacerbated by 
turnover, especially because CGRs have no authority 
over who will be hired and when, and line officers have 
little incentive to go beyond their performance require­
ments and engage with collaboratives (Greer 2012, 
Butler et al. 2015, Cheng et al. 2019, McIntyre 2019, 
Coleman et al. 2021).
Resource Constraints
Although sustained funding was generally reported as 
a contributing factor to CFLRP success, uncertainty in 
the amount and timing of funding, as well as restric­
tions on its use, was considered a barrier (Treadaway 
2013, Schultz et al. 2018, Bothwell 2019). Delays in 
executing grants and agreements affected the timing of 
dispersed funds and implementation timelines. CFLRP 
funding could only be used for monitoring and im­
plementation, not for planning and collaborative ac­
tivities (Mattor 2013, Treadaway 2013, Schultz et al. 
2018), which further constrained CGRs:
The issue is not building relationships and spear­
heading the collaborations, but instead it’s the 
lack of funding to sustain those relationships and 
collaboratives.18
Lack of time to invest in collaboration among CGRs, 
external organizations, and agency personnel also con­
strained adaptive capacity (National Forest Foundation 
2016, McIntyre and Schultz 2020). Some CGRs relied 
on a few key people—often volunteers—to carry out 
multiple tasks and found difficulty in recruiting and re­
taining unpaid leadership and staff (Schultz et al. 2018, 
Coleman et al. 2021, USDA Forest Service 2021). The 
partners they engaged with were often understaffed, 
further challenging resource investments in collab­
orative activities. For some agency staff, collaborative 
engagement was not part of their primary job require­
ments which, when combined with vacant positions, 
meant that agency staff were not always able to execute 
projects and meet stakeholder expectations (Egan and

et al. 2014, 2018, Butler et al. 2019, McIntyre 2019).
Discussion
Adaptability and Action in the Face 
of Change
This article assessed how CGRs mobilized adaptive 
capacity to three common disruptions—personnel 
turnover, biophysical disturbances, and legal or policy 
changes. We situated our discussion within the theor­
ized determinants of adaptive capacity presented in the 
conceptual framework (social capital, social learning, 
flexibility, and resources).
Regarding social capital and learning, CGRs facili­
tated dialogue and engaged in field trips, onboarding 
workshops, joint fact-finding, multiparty monitoring, 
and adaptive management. These activities helped 
build trust and relationships across networks to reach 
consensus about the purpose and need for restor­
ation, evaluate the impacts of biophysical disturbance 
and treatment alternatives, and temper conflict be­
tween differing objectives. Strong linking social capital 
(Pelling and High 2005) with forest leadership was 
critical in maintaining support for collaboration amid 
turnover and biophysical disturbance.
The codevelopment of, and interaction with, 
boundary objects helped CGRs translate this learning 
and social capital into codified expectations and re­
sponsibilities amid turnover (e.g., memorandums of 
understanding, charters). Documents (e.g., GTRs) 
and engagement with models (e.g., ecological condi­
tion model) were key to institutionalizing collabora­
tive vision and recommendations, capturing learning 
from biophysical disturbances to inform management 
decisions, and reducing conflict and litigation through 
CGR transitions. Boundary-spanning individuals and 
organizations provide resources and support func­
tions (Folke et al. 2005, Colavito 2019). In the CGRs 
analyzed here, these individuals and organizations fa­
cilitated the development of boundary objects and sup­
ported onboarding activities, supported CGRs in legal 
matters, and provided scientific expertise for moni­
toring and informing restoration strategies.
CGRs also demonstrated flexibility. They developed 
agreements across boundaries to maintain restoration 
work despite an injunction, changed their structure 
and function to accommodate new policy require­
ments, and diversified funding resources and existing 
agreements to match the scale of disruptions with the 
scale of restoration.
Institutional and Structural Barriers Bound 
Adaptation Actions
Yet the confluence of three components—authority, 
accountability, and capacity—created barriers to CGR 
resilience. Even with CGR attention to managing turn­
over, the agency culture of rotating personnel and 
limited capacity to fill vacant positions undermined 
collaborative engagement. It takes time to build trust, 
personal relationships, and understanding of the social 
and ecological context in which CGRs are embedded 
(Moote and Becker 2003, Coleman et al. 2021, Santo 
et  al. 2021). Yet CGRs have no formal authority to 
influence whether or when Forest Service personnel 
transfer to other positions.
In some cases, low commitment to collaboration 
at local and regional levels constrained collaborative 
engagement and their influence on management deci­
sions. Sharma-Wallace (2018) found that consultation 
without substantial engagement of collaboratives in 
informing decisions diminished long-term governance 
outcomes. The Forest Service gives local leadership 
considerable autonomy in decision-making. Decisions 
are made based on individual interpretations of, and 
support for, policy initiatives, as well as local capacity 
and culture (Moseley and Charnley 2014). Decision-
makers must also navigate multiple and potentially 
conflicting rules, regulations, procedures, and perform­
ance measures that can affect whether and to what 
extent collaboratives are engaged and inform manage­
ment actions (Biber 2008). Collaborative engagement 
often increases agency personnel workload and is dif­
ficult to encourage when few incentives exist (Moote 
and Becker 2003, Agranoff 2006, Biber 2008).
Thus, CGRs often must persuade individuals to re­
main accountable to the collaborative process—our 
results demonstrate success was variable. Reliance on 
individual commitment to collaboration was compli­
cated by frequent turnover, as CGRs must build rela­
tionships with new staff and renegotiate commitments, 
expectations, and accountabilities (Orth and Cheng 
2019, Coleman et al. 2021). This diminishes the ability 
of CGRs to maintain social capital across levels of au­
thority and influence (Pelling and High 2005). Although 
leaders are key to legitimizing collaboration and pro­
moting adaptability (Olsson et al. 2006, Westley et al. 
2013), reliance on individual leaders leaves CGRs vul­
nerable, as it can signal that collaboration is not yet 
institutionalized (Cheng et al. 2019). Further, resource 
constraints in personnel and funding inhibited the ability 
of participants to engage in the CGR and carry out their 
work. For example, CFLRP funding could not be used

Journal of Forestry, 2022, Vol. XX, No. XX
for collaborative planning and capacity-building to sup­
port trust-building, conflict management, and learning, 
which are necessary to support resilience. Similar bar­
riers have been noted since the late 1990s and early 
2000s (Wondolleck and Yaffee 1997, 2000, Moote and 
Becker 2003). Policy initiatives that require collabor­
ation in public lands management are unlikely to sus­
tain resilient CGRs until these barriers are addressed. We 
provide several policy and practice recommendations to 
enhance CGR resilience below.
Policy Recommendations
Expand Funding for Collaborative Planning and 
Capacity Building
Activities that support social learning, conflict manage­
ment, and relationship-building are critical for CGR 
adaptability. Support for and investment in leaders, 
facilitators, and science staff is necessary to sustain 
CGRs over time (Cheng and Sturtevant 2012, Colavito 
2019). Our findings indicate that monitoring was key 
to helping CGRs learn from disturbance, deter litiga­
tion, and inform management decisions. Thus, funding 
for collaborative planning should not replace moni­
toring and implementation funding.
Change in Agency Culture and Commitment to 
Collaboration
Ensuring that staff are dedicated to collaborative pro­
jects until completion, facilitating promote-in-place op­
portunities, and hiring dedicated partnership liaisons 
to manage relationships could help address turnover. 
Also, including expectations for collaboration in job re­
quirements and evaluations and requiring collaboration 
training would facilitate the development of personnel 
with skills, interests, and commitment to collaboration 
(Schultz et al. 2017, Butler and Schultz 2019b).
Particularly important is the development of agency 
performance measures for collaborative engagement. 
Performance measures should be easy to measure and 
communicate, complementary, and seen as priorities 
(Biber 2008, Schultz et  al. 2015, Santo et  al. 2020). 
Personnel shortages and budget constraints may hinder 
the ability of agency professionals to assess collaborative 
performance and integrate results into decision making 
(Wurtzebach et al. 2019), and internal performance meas­
ures may do little to improve agency accountability and 
responsiveness to CGRs (Schultz et al. 2015). Including 
external reviews from nonagency stakeholders involved 
in CGRs as part of forest unit performance evaluations 
could incentivize personnel to invest time and resources 
in collaboration (Cheng et al. 2019).
Practice Recommendations
Codevelop and Periodically Revisit Boundary Objects
Sustaining the codevelopment of and engagement with 
boundary objects is important for restoration practi­
tioners to build trust, absorb learning, and sustain in­
stitutional knowledge (Cash et al. 2003, Cheng et al. 
2019, Stern and Coleman 2019). Whenever possible, 
boundary objects should be situated within agency 
decision-making procedures, which may reduce re­
liance on individuals and encourage accountability 
(Cheng et al. 2015, Urgenson et al. 2017). With new 
personnel, CGRs and supporting entities negotiate re­
sponsibilities, accountabilities, and capacities (Orth 
and Cheng 2019). Thus, boundary objects should be 
periodically reviewed to maintain legitimacy, saliency, 
and credibility (Cash et al. 2003, Cheng et al. 2015).
Conduct Frequent Self-Assessments of Collaborative 
Resilience
CGR adaptability is context- and time-dependent (Smit 
and Wandel 2006). CGRs can experience external or in­
ternal disruptions at any time, which can expose groups 
to new vulnerabilities and opportunities. The challenge is 
for CGRs to be prepared for and enhance the capacity to 
deal with both known and unknown disruptions (Berkes 
2007). Further, CGR structure, function, and capacity 
may evolve (Ulibarri et  al. 2020, Salerno et  al. 2021). 
Therefore, CGRs should routinely self-assess the disrup­
tions to which they are exposed, and both short-term and 
long-term adaptations for collaborative resilience.
Conclusion
The Forest Service and policies like the CFLRP continue 
to encourage collaboration to advance wildfire risk re­
duction and forest restoration goals. Yet research on 
how CGRs adapt and remain resilient to disruptions is 
underexplored. Using the case of the CFLRP and other 
public forest CGRs, this study assessed (1) how CGRs 
adapted to internal and external disruptions and (2) what 
barriers constrained CGR resilience. Many CGRs exhib­
ited high adaptability by building social capital and trust, 
engaging in social learning, and demonstrating flexibility 
to adjust response options and manage relationships 
among diverse actors. Still, several barriers, including 
agency culture, commitment, incentives, and resource 
constraints, complicated collaborative resilience. These 
barriers undermined CGR authority to influence actions, 
limited staff capacity to engage in collaborative efforts, 
and diminished agency accountability to collaboratives. 
We identified policy and practice recommendations to

increase CGR resilience and continue to meet the na­
tional policy goals they are intended to support.
An important study limitation should be noted. 
The analysis was a point-in-time assessment, a 
common limitation of collaborative governance re­
search (Ulibarri et  al. 2020). To address this, fu­
ture work should assess how forest collaboratives 
evolve through time and adapt collaborative struc­
tures, processes, and practices to multiple stressors. 
Additionally, larger sample systematic studies are 
needed to complement the rich case study literature 
and provide evidence base for comparisons across 
cases, contexts, and scales. One approach being ex­
plored is to build surveys for CFLR participants in on­
going monitoring protocols to support social learning 
among CGRs and identify where changes are needed 
to support adaptive management.
