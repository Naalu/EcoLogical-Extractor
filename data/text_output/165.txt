Survey: Forest Service trusted with restoration

Arizonans aren't yet ready to let wildfires -- even ones that don't endanger people -- burn 
out, as the U.S. Forest Service sometimes recommends.  
But 72 percent do trust the Forest Service to properly manage the forests, according to a 
new statewide scientific survey by Northern Arizona University's Social Research 
Laboratory.  
And in a further ratification of Forest Service policies 79 percent agreed that more money 
should be spent by the government to restore unhealthy forests and 85 percent that forest 
restoration should be done in wilderness areas if they are unhealthy.  
Further, once restoration thinning is begun, 67 percent believe it is appropriate to sell the 
trees.  
Although 78 percent of those surveyed agreed with the statement, "Not all forest fires are 
bad," less than half supported letting non-human-threatening fires burn.  
"Arizonans apparently distinguish between beneficial and destructive fire, but many are 
still uncomfortable with allowing wildfires to burn," said a press release from the Social 
Research Laboratory.  
When asked who the think provides the most accurate information about how to manage 
forests, more than one-third of respondents (37 percent) selected universities, followed by 
government land managers at 29 percent.  
Coming in third were environmental groups with 20 percent.  
The survey was conducted by the Social Research Laboratory on behalf of NAU's 
Ecological Restoration Institute. Calling took place between March 23 and 26.  
A total of 423 randomly selected Arizonans participated, and results are accurate within a 
margin of 4.8 percentage points.
