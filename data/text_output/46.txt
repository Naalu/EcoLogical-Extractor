Introduction 
Many studies of pre-European cettlement wectern 
Pinusponde1,osa forects have documented periodic sur- 
face fires at a mean interval of 2 - 15 yr (Cooper 196 1; 
Swetnam & Dieterich 1985: Swetnam & Baisan 1995). 
Since the late 1800c, logging. livestock grazing. and fire 
suppression in northern Arizona P. yonderosa forests 
have altered the pre-settlement fire regime (Weaver 
1951; Covington et al. 1997). Thic hac led to structural 
and functional changec in these pinelbunchgrasc forests, 
resulting in dence forects that are now threatened by 
"stand-replacing" crown firec (Covington &Moore 1994; 
Moir et al. 1997). Recent southwestern fires in P. 
yonderosa forectc are generally agreed among ecolo- 
gists to be outside the range of variability of pre-settle- 
ment fire regimec (Foxx 1996; Bogan et al. 1998). 
However, Shinneman & Baker (1997) cite historical 
records from the Black Hills, South Dakota suggesting 
that infrequent 'catastrophic' fires did, in fact, occur 
within pre-settlement P. yonderosa forests. 
Our study suggests that the terms 'catastrophic' and 
'stand replacing fires' oversimplify the situation. The 
studied extensive fires of 1996 burned erratically over a 
very large area. We identified high severity fires in 
those parts of the landscape where all or most of the 
trees were killed (synonymous with stand replacing 
fires) and moderate severity fires where most trees 
exhibited crown scorch in lower portions of their canopy 
but few were killed. Still other areas were unburned and 
were used in this study as controls. The 1988 Yellowstone 
fires are another example of this variable burning pat- 
tern across the landscape (Turner et al. 1997). 
Research on vegetation recovery after widespread 
fires in southwestern P. ponderosa forests is limited 
(Pearson et al. 1972; Beaulieu 1975; Oswald 1981; 
Oswald & Covington 1984; Foxx 1996). We define 
recovery as post-fire vegetation changes, which is simi- 
lar to Holling's (1992) 'reorganization' phase following 
fire. Recovery. as used here. is not synonymous with 
succession, since the latter implies predictability of plant 
assemblage sequences after the disturbance event. Most 
models of post-fire succession in dry western coniferous 
forests are abstract and generalized. without floristic 
detail (Moir & Dieterich 1988: Bradley et al. 1992; 
Smith & Fischer 1997). There is not only a clear lack of 
knowledge about recovery following intense, large-scale 
fires in southwestern P. ponderosa forests, but an equally 
clear likelihood of more such fires in the future. This study 
following the 1996 fires in northern Arizona provides a 
first quantitative glimpse into vegetation recovery. 
Ecosystem recovery depends on opportunity and 
chance as well as the diversity left behind after the fire 
and what can respond to the new opportunities from the 
edges of the burn or beyond (Franklin et al. 1997). After 
disturbance, there is a period of dominance by seral 
opportunists, followed by species of mid- and late- 
successional stages (Dyrness 1973; Hanks &Dick-Peddie

Fig. 1.Wildfires in fore5t5 of Arizona and New Mexico from 
1912to 1996. Data are from the USDA Fore5t Service, South- 
western Region, Albuquerque. New Mexico. 
1974; Barney & Frischknecht 1974: Keeley et al. 1981 ; 
Halpern 1989). This period is exploited by mostly na- 
tive opportunistic species which can colonize recently 
disturbed, open habitats (Bazzaz 1986; Orians 1986). 
Exotic plants. however. also fill this role in early years 
after fire disturbance. We observed the post-fire vegeta- 
tion of 1996 to be patchy and variable in composition. 
Some species (e.g. Dicmtliu., arnzericl) are new additions 
to the Arizona flora, suggesting that these newly created 
habitats may become entry routes for a changing flora. 
The exotic flora worldwide is increasing rapidly with 
over 40 million ha of land currently infested in North 
America alone, including over 7 million ha of public 
lands in the western United States (Anon. 1998: Anon. 
No Date). The area of land burned by wildfire has also 
increased dramatically in recent decades. The area of 
southwestern forests burned by wildfire reached a peak in 
1996 when over 137 000 ha in Arizona and New Mexico 
burned (Fig. 1). Expanding exotic flora coupled with 
disturbances created by widespread fires present new and 
unknown pathways of recovery. In 1996, fires of varying 
severity over this large area provided an opportunity to 
investigate the recovery of vegetation, both native and 
exotic. We report on plant composition and exotic species 
responses within areas of varying fire severity in three 
1996 bums of northern Arizona. 
Three large wildfires occurred in 1996 in Pznur 
ponderora forests on the Mogollon and Kaibab Plateauc 
in central and northern Arizona, respectively (34" 3 1' -
36" 36' N, 11 1 "22' - 112" 18' W). From June 20 to July 
26. the Bridges-Knoll (BK) fire complex in the Kalbab 
National Forest (Kaibab NF) burned ca. 6500 ha of P 
ponder-ora forest The Hochderffer fire (HO) began 
June 20 and ended on July 3. burning ca 5000 ha of P. 
ponde1,osa forest In the Coconino NF Also on the 
Coconino NF, the Pot fire (PO) burned ca 2800 ha of P. 
ponderosa forest from June 21 until June 27 Moct of 
our plots were in forests of the Pinzis yonderosalFestzica 
~rizonicaand P. ponderosaIMuhlenbe~.gia nzontana as-
sociations and a few plots were in the P. ponderosal 
Bozitelozia gracilis association (Anon. 1997). Prior to 
burning, most stands were close-canopied, even-aged 
'blackjack' P. ponderosa (trees younger than ca. 125 yr) 
with occasional patches of 'yellowpine' (larger trees 
older than ca. 150 yr) not exceeding 10 treeslha (cf. 
stage 5 in Moir & Dieterich 1988). Some stands had 
been thinned (smaller trees removed) but remained es- 
sentially close-canopied with respect to overstorey trees. 
The study region has a mean annual precipitation of 
500 -600 mm, a drought period from April to June and a 
mean annual air temperature of 5 - 6 "C (Anon. 1995). 
BK study sites were on gentle to moderate slopes with 
soil parent materials derived from sandstones and lime- 
stones of the Kaibab formation. The HO sites were on 
gentle slopes with soil parent materials of basalt and 
cinders. PO sites were on gentle to moderate slopes on 
soil derived from sandstones of the Coconino Forma- 
tion. After each fire. reseeding efforts by the Forest 
Service were restricted to steep slopes, none of which 
were sampled. 
P.yonder-osa tree structures were similar in the three 
study areas. Densities and basal areas (Table 1) were 
similar in the BK and PO study areas and were com- 
bined. Live P. yonderosa had a lower range of densities 
in the PO and BK sites of moderate fire severities than in 
moderate severity burns at HO sites. Dead P. ponderosa 
had somewhat lower densities in the high severity burn 
plots of the PO and BK sites than in the HO sites.

However, basal areas of live and dead pines were in the 
came range across all three sites. In addition Quel~us 
ganzbelii had low density and basal areac in some plots 
in the PO and BK citec. 
Methods 
Field nzethods 
Sampling was conducted in July and August 1998. 
Stands were selected by criteria of homogeneity and size. 
Homogeneity was subjectively judged by uniformity of 
tree density and size. site features such as slope and soil 
parent material. and by fire severity. Stand sizes were large 
enough to allow calculation of means from replicated 
sample plots without edge effects from rneadows or forests 
with contrasting tree densities. We avoided stands that had 
been salvage logged. Stands were classified into fire sever- 
ity categories as described above. Stands in category U 
were unburned in the general fire area. Stands in category 
M had moderate severity bums where few or no trees were 
killed but whose crowns exhibited some degree of scorch. 
Stands in category H had high severity bums characterized 
by all or nearly all trees killed. 
In the HO fire, four large stands (200 m x 200 m) and 
two smaller stands (< 2 ha and irreg~~lar 
in shape) of each 
severity class were selected for sampling. The use of 
variable stand sizes was dictated by the erratic bum pat- 
terns of these flrec. Each large stand was divided into 20m 
x 20 m sections. Four of these sections were chosen 
randomly for plot measurements. In each chosen section a 
random point was determined from a diagonal across the 
section. This point was the geometric center of two parallel 
transects 5 m apast and 12 m long that were perpendicular 
to the diagonal. A plot consisted of both transects (Fig. 2). 
Vegetation and soil surface features were measured along 
each transect as described below. In each of the six smaller, 
irregularly shaped stands a line was located through the 
center and plots were laid out at two random points along 
this line. We obtained a total of 20 plots in each of the 
severity classes (U, M, and H) in the HO. 
In the PO and BK fires, stands varied in size and their 
boundaries were more irregular than in the HO fire be- 
cause of salvage logging. We partitioned each stand into 
three or four sections. In each section, three or four living 
or dead trees widely spaced from one another were sub- 
jectively indicated, and one was randomly chosen. This 
tree was numbered for plot identification. The first transect 
in a plot commenced 5 m from the tagged tree base in a 
random direction. The second transect was 5 m away and 
parallel to the first. As in the HO, transects were 12 m 
long and a plot consisted of both transects (Fig. 2). In the 
PO we obtained 3 plots in each of the severity classes (U,

M, and H); in the BK we obtained 11. 12 and 11 plots 
within the recpective severity classes. 
In all three fire areas, plots were marked at each 
comer with permanent iron rebar and plot locations 
mapped. Along each trancect we measured vascular plants 
by canopy coverage (Daubenmire 1959) in 12 microplots 
(20 cm x 50 cm). placed I m apart (Fig. 2). In each 
microplot, the following attributec were meacured: litter, 
coarse woody debris (wood fragments > 10 cm in width), 
rocks and gravel (coarce mineral fragments > 2 mm 
diameter), vegetation basal area (areas of living vegeta- 
tion on the ground curface). cryptogamc on soil and bare 
soil (mineral particles < 2 mm). Charcoal wac classed as 
litter. Different workerc were calibrated ac described by 
Pfister & Amo (1 980), so that vegetation and coil surface 
features were meacured concistently. 
Data oizalysis 
The mean canopy coverage over the 24 microplots of 
each plot (Fig. 2) was calculated for vegetation and ground 
surface variables. Combined data from the three fires 
were grouped by severity class for all analyses. Floristic 
composition among plots was explored using global Non- 
metric Multidimensional Scaling, NMDS (Minchin 1989: 
Kent & Cokes 1992). Dissimilarity in floristic composi- 
tion between plots was calculated using the Bray-Curtis 
measure of dissimilarity (Faith et al. 1987). Floristic

differences among and between fire severity classes were 
analyzed using the ANOSIM procedure. a non-paramet- 
sic analogue for analysis of variance (Clarke 1993). The 
SIMPER routine (Clark 1993). which calculates the rela- 
tive contributions of each species to the average similar- 
ity among samples in a group, was then used to identify 
the most important species that characterized the three 
fire severity classes. 
Relationshim between four variables and NMDS con- 
figurations were examined by fitting vectors of maxi- 
mum correlation within the NMDS configuration (Downes 
et al. 1995: Wahren et al. 1999). Trends in species cover 
along vectors were summarized in ordered tables. Spe- 
cies cover was standardized to unit maxima. The vectors 
were then divided into 10 segments (Kantvilas &Minchin 
1989; Wahren et al. 1999) and species cover values were 
divided into five equal classes (upper boundaries of 0.2. 
0.4, 0.6. 0.8, 1.0; classes 1 to 5 respectively). For ex- 
ample. a species that had a standardized cover of 0.85 in 
the first segment of a vector would be indicated by a 5 in 
the first column of the ordered table. 
Species di~ersity of each plot was calculated using 
species richness (total number of species per sample. 
Moore & Chapman 1986), the Shannon-Wiener func- 
tion (Kent & Cokes 1992) and Pielou's evenness index 
(Pielou 1975). These data and two environmental vari- 
ables (litter and bare soil) were explored using box and 
probability plots. Only the litter and bare soil data met 
the assumptions of ANOVA. The diversity data could 
not be corrected by transformations and was analyzed 
using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis H-test with 
pairwise cotnparisons analyzed using the Mann-Whitney 
U-test. Probability values from multiple pairwise com- 
parisons were adjusted using the sequential Bonferroni 
method (Holm 1979: Sokal & Rohlf 1995). 
Results 
There were 30 exotic species among the 161 vascular 
plants found at the three fire areas (Table 2). Of the total 
understorey cover measured. exotics comprised 26%. 
Common exotic species (cover > 20%) included Bmm~ts 
tectontnz, Chenopodium album. Cony,-a canadensis and 
Salsola kali. Two additional exotic species with legal 
designation as noxious in Arizona. Linaria dalnzatica and 
Convoh~~tlus
arvense. were found outside the plots and 
were not sampled. Exotic species attained their highest 
cover in H plots. while contributing < 1% cover in all U 
plots. 
The ordination of floristic data revealed a clear separa- 
tion of U and H clusters. with the M group intermediate 
between the two (Fig. 3). This was supported by results 
from ANOSIM, which showed significant differences in

floristic composition among the fire severity classes (glo- 
bal R = 0 . 3 0 7 , ~<0.001). Similarly, painvise comparisons 
revealed significant differences between severity classes (p 
< 0.001). Mean similarity was low for all three classes (U 
= 11.86; M = 11.01; H = 14.54), which we interpret to 
reflect the overall patchy nature of the communities. 
Results from SIMPER analysis showed that species 
that contribute most to percent similarity among the U 
plots were the gaminoids Muhlenbergiu nzontana. Carex 
spp..Elym~ts elymoides and Feshica ari:onica. Characteriz-
ing the M plots were M. montana. E. elymoides. Lutus 
wrightii and Cl~enopodium alb~tnz. Species characteristic of 
the H plots were the exotics C. album and Sal~ohkuli and 
the woody re-sprouting shrubs Querc~tsgambeliiandRobinin 
neomexicana. Mean dissimilarity was high (>90%) for all 
comparisons between severity classes. Since many species 
in M were common in both U and H classes. only the 
results of H compared with U are presented here (Table 3).

Crawford. J.A. et al. 
Table 4. The litter and bare soil distributions are nearly 
mirror images for most species; i.e., plants respond 
oppositely to litter and bare soil. Generally, exotic plants 
favour little litter and most bare soil, while native plants 
favour ground surfaces with moderate litter and bare 
soil. There were no taxa dominating areas of high litter 
cover (vector segments 9 and 10 in Table 4), because 
unburned pole stands. where litter is thick, exhibit sup- 
pression of both exotic and native plants (Covington & 
Moore 1994: Moir et al. 1997). 
There were significant differences 07 < 0.001) in 
cover of bare soil and litter among and between fire 
severity classes. Bare soil increased with fire severity 
from plot means of 9 to 3 1 and 59 % in U. M, and H plots 
while litter declined (76, 41 and 9 5%) in these classes, 
respectively. Analysis of diversity data based on all spe- 
cies revealed a highly significant difference @ < 0.01) in 
species richness among fire severity classes. Pairwise 
comparisons found significant differences for U vs. M 
(p = 0.004) and U vs. H (17 < 0.001). Among fire severity 
classes, both Shannon-Wiener and Pielou's Evenness 
were marginally significant 07 = 0.045 and p = 0.046, 
respectively). Using native species only, analysis of 
diversity indices among se~erity classes was non-sig- 
nificant. The mean species richness, based on all species 
and native species only were 18.4 and 17.3 in U, 24.5 
and 19.2 in M and 24.8 and 18.2 in H. Thus. exotic 
species contributed successively more to species rich- 
ness in plots progressing from the unburned to moderate 
and high severity burns. With increasing fire severity. 
Shannon-Wiener species diversity also increased. but 
much of this was due to exotic species. The total cover 
of exotic species in H plots was ca. twice that in M plots 
(Table 2). 
Discussion 
Disturbance often increases plant diversity (e.g. 
Connell 1978; Sousa 1979). In this study, much of the 
post-disturbance flora was comprised of exotic species. 
This enrichment of exotic species two years after fire is 
greater than reported in other studies. At Yellowstone 
National Park following the 1988 fire, Turner et al. 
(1997) reported that the density of opportunistic spe- 
cies, including the exotics Cir~iunzawense and Lactuca 
serriola, increased with increasing fire severity. Simi- 
larly, our results revealed that overall exotic plant cover 
was greatest in burnt areas and was highest in high severity 
bums. Foxx (1996), in her studies of the Pinusponderosa 
forests of the 1977 La Mesa fire of northem New Mexico. 
noted up to 3.6 % cover of the exotic Te1o.uq.s graveolens in 
early years following this widespread bum. In another 
study in northern Arizonan P. ponderosa forests Beau- 
lieu (1 975) found a 10-fold increase in the biomass of 
Chenopodiun~ album and a doubling in biomass of 
Conyza canadensis initially following the Rattle Burn 
of 1972. There were far more exotic species and greater 
cover of them in our study than reported by either Foxx 
or Beaulieu. 
Other than the above-mentioned research. few stud- 
ies in P. ponderosa forests provide detailed floristics of 
post-fire recovery. If one looks to other inter-mountain 
plant communities, however, there are many examples 
of increases in cover or colonization by annual (but 
mostly native) species following fire (Dyrness 1973: 
Lyon & Stickney 1976; Schoonmaker & McKee 1988: 
Halpern 1989). None of these studies called attention to 
the proportion or dominance of exotic species, but sev- 
eral studies in more arid ecosystems have reported ex- 
otic plant invasions after disturbances. For example. 
Salsola kali increased immediately after fire in a pinyon- 
juniper woodland in Utah (Barney & Frischknecht 1974) 
and Bromus tectorunz occurred in both the initial coloni- 
zation and later sera1 stages after wildfire in sagebrush 
shrub-steppe (Young & Evans 1978). 
Our results showed a marked post-fire increase in 
both the cover and diversity of exotic species. What 
does this response imply for plant succession and pre- 
diction of short-term post-fire responses to fires that will 
occur elsewhere in similar environments? Both predict- 
ability and surprise characterize recovery. Predictability 
follows from the legacy hypothesis, whose main tenets 
are that future characteristics of developing stands and 
successional rates are influenced by the pre-disturbance 
biota and by remnant. post-disturbance structural1 
compositional diversity of the stands (Lyon & Stickney 
1976; Franklin et al. 1997: Perry & Amaranthus 1997). 
Only the stands burned at moderate fire severity con- 
tained most. if not all. of the legacy elements that point 
to a structure and composition indicative of future P. 
ponderosa forests. 
Typical moderate severity burns exhibit green tree 
retention. large diameter trees. snags. logs and patchy 
remnants of pre-burn flora co-existing with newly cre- 
ated vegetation patches of early-sera1 native and exotic 
plants. By contrast. as shown here and in other studies 
(Moir & Dieterich 1988: Covington & Moore 1994: 
Stone et al. 1999), unburned forests are excessively 
stocked with thickets of tree regeneration, depauperate 
in the understorey and suffering high mortality of older 
yellowpine. In early years following severe fires, stands 
have largely altered understories that may or may not 
eventually return to pre-fire conditions. We suspect that 
without human intervention, severely burned P. 
ponderosa forests probably lag behind by a number of 
decades from progressing into seedling-sapling. pole 
and later stages of forest development.

- Responses of exotic plant species to fires in Pinus poizderosa forests -
The legacy hypothesis is quiet on the roles of exotic 
plants in succession. Our experience suggests that many 
exotics may be dominant for only a few years or at best 
persist as very minor components of future forests (we 
sidestep possible effects of livestock or wildlife graz- 
ing). Is this true or are exotics, once introduced, now 
part of the legacy? Were some, if not all, of the exotic 
species already a viable component of the pre-burn 
condition? Are exotics a legacy colouring future stand 
conditions, albeit a legacy hidden in the soil seed bank 
or in nearby roads or otherwise disturbed source areas? 
D o  we henceforth manage for exotic species as an 
established element of the forests? The answers to these 
questions are important to whatever degree future fires, 
including prescription bums, mimic the moderate sever- 
ity burns of this study. 
The complementary viewpoint to the legacy hypoth- 
esis of succession is the unpredictability and potential 
for surprise in future forest development (Holling 1992; 
Moir & Mowrer 1995). Pinehunchgrass forests that 
experienced recent widespread fires and resultant high 
severity post-fire stand conditions are in a reconstruc- 
tion phase of development (Holling 1992), a dynamic 
process about which we have limited knowledge. W e  
were surprised by these results, i.e. dominance or co- 
dominance by exotic plants in our plots in 1998 could 
not have been predicted. Our study indicated that there 
are few above-ground clues in understories or tree struc- 
tures of unburned stands (pre-burn measurements in our 
plots were not available). 
Overall understorey richness was greatest in the 
burned areas of this study, and while there were no 
significant differences in species richness between mod- 
erate and high severity burns, the total cover of exotic 
species was considerably greater in high severity burns. 
This has clear implications for prescribed burns and will 
require further study where management objectives 
specify the maintenance of a predominately native flora. 
Had any of these fires occurred in locations containing 
other noxious species of the region, such as Centa~trea 
solstitialis, Ec~phorhia esltla, or Centauren d i f f ~ ~ s a ,  
the 
results of this study might have been very different. 
This study has shown correlative and individualistic 
associations of exotic plants with fire severity. The 
causes of post-fire understorey patterns remain elusive. 
Among the factors needing examination are the pre- 
burn patchiness of exotic seeds in the soil, pre-burn 
patterns of trees and understorey vegetation, the spatial 
variability of fire severities and effects on soil, post-fire 
soil erosion patterns, influences of large grazing ungu- 
lates on exotic plants and soil seedbanks and the effects 
of competition between exotic and native plant species 
in post-fire recovery.
