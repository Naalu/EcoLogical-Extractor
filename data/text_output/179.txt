ABSTRACT.—We assessed relative abundance, demographic, and reproductive success data for two lizard
species in a Northern Arizona ponderosa pine forest, a ﬁre-dependent system unnaturally modiﬁed by ﬁre
suppression over the past century. During May to October 1997–1999, we employed up to 70 pitfall arrays
to sample lizards over 6990 array-days. At each array, we described macro-vegetative cover, stand, and
microhabitat characteristics. Sceloporus graciosus responded to habitat variation at all three spatial scales.
Adult S. graciosus were widely distributed among cover and stand types. However, reproductive success and
hatchling abundance were highest in the most open cover (meadow) and stand (savannah) types, and lowest
in pure ponderosa cover and dense ponderosa stands. Adult females replaced themselves annually only in
meadows, savannahs, and forest with a deciduous component. Eumeces skiltonianus adults and juveniles were
least abundant in meadows, but females replaced themselves each year in meadow and ponderosa-pinyon-
juniper vegetative cover and in savannahs. Hatchlings were least abundant in intermediate- and high-density
ponderosa stands, whereas juveniles of both species were most abundant in areas containing a deciduous tree
component. Both species were present in plots having lower percent duff groundcover than at plots containing
no lizards. Increased tree densities, canopy closure, and litter accumulation inﬂuenced distributions of both
lizards. Furthermore, abundance and reproduction in these lizards were generally optimized in habitat with
features most similar to that present prior to ﬁre suppression activities and in areas containing a deciduous
tree component.
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest is the
most common montane vegetative cover type in
the southwestern United States, covering 3.4
million ha in Arizona and New Mexico alone
(Brown, 1994), and providing habitat for over 280
native vertebrate species (New Mexico Game and
Fish Department, 2000). Historically, the physical
structure and ﬂoral composition of these forests
were maintained by periodic, low intensity ﬁre
recurring roughly every four to 36 years (Swet-
nam and Baisan, 1996), periodic drought, and
grass-seedling competition (Covington et al.,
1997). Thus, ponderosa forests were heteroge-
neous at multiple temporal and spatial scales
(Cooper, 1960; White, 1985) and were generally
dominated by low tree densities with vegetative
understories in various stages of seral maturation
depending on local ﬁre frequency.
Human ﬁre suppression and logging activities
over the past ;125 years in the American
southwest have caused most ponderosa pine
forests to become unnaturally dense and ﬁre-
prone (Covington and Moore, 1994; Fule´ et al.,
1997; Swetnam et al., 1999). In modern south-
western ponderosa forests, tree densities are up
to 8.5 times greater than circa 1883 (Fule´ et al.,
1997) and are characterized by increased can-
opy closure, decreased sunlight penetration to
ground level, a replacement of herbs and grasses
with deep beds of ﬂammable organic litter (Kolb
et al., 1994; Covington et al., 1997), and a con-
comitant loss of habitat heterogeneity at the
microhabitat, forest stand, and landscape scales.
As these conditions have intensiﬁed, biodiversity
in ponderosa forests is believed to have de-
creased over the past several decades (Noss et al.,
1995).
Studies in other regions of the United States
have demonstrated that lizard populations can
decline in the absence of natural disturbance
regimes such as ﬁre (Greenberg et al., 1994;
Ballinger and Watts, 1995). In this paper, we
report on a three-year study of the species
composition, spatial distributions, relative abun-
dance, and reproductive success of lizards in
a ponderosa pine forest that has been ﬁre-
suppressed for ;125 years (Moore et al., 1999).
We ﬁrst described forest habitat conditions at
three spatial scales, since knowledge of patterns
of habitat selection at different spatial scales is
vital to successful management and conservation
of species (Johnson, 1980; Block and Brennan,
1993). We mapped the current distribution of
distinct vegetative cover types, grouped forest

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Area.—We conducted this study at the
Mt.
Trumbull
Resource
Conservation
Area
(RCA) in the southern portion of the Unikaret
Plateau on the Arizona Strip, north of the
Colorado River and west of the Kaibab Plateau.
Our study area (N368214.4889, W1138104.2549)
lay between Trumbull (2448 m) and Logan (2398
m) Mountains in a broad saddle shaped by
volcanic activity. Lizards and vegetation were
sampled between 1980 and 2196 m elevation. The
major vegetative communities within the study
area included pure ponderosa pine forest and
ponderosa-deciduous forest, which included both
Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) and New Mexican
locust (Robinia neomexicana). Pinyon (Pinus edulis)
and
juniper
(Juniperus
osteosperma)
occurred
sporadically throughout the RCA and dominated
the south-facing slopes and lower elevations.
The Mt. Trumbull area has a bimodal pattern
of precipitation with peaks during winter and
summer; spring and fall are relatively dry.
Annual precipitation at Nixon Spring (1982 m,
north end of the study area) averaged 32.9 cm/
year, based on a 30-year average ending in 2000
(WRCC, 2000).
Euro-American settlement of the Mt. Trumbull
area occurred in 1870 and logging of the area
began two years later. Small, portable sawmills
were used nearly continuously until the 1960s
(J. H. Altschul and H. C. Fairley, unpubl. data).
Cattle grazing also began in the 1870s and
continues today. Typical of the American south-
west, the Mt. Trumbull area has been under
active ﬁre suppression for the past century
(Moore et al., 1999; Ecological Restoration In-
stitute, unpubl. data).
Sampling Design.—We collected lizard relative
abundance and demography data using pitfall
traps (Jones, 1986; Bury and Corn, 1987). We
installed 70 pitfall arrays on a 300-m grid system
overlaid on the study area, resulting in pro-
portional stratiﬁcation among vegetative cover
types but randomness with respect to stand and
microhabitat features. Arrays consisted of four
buckets, three equally spaced about a center
bucket. Periphery buckets were 7.6 m from the
center bucket and were connected by a 15-cm
high drift fence. Buckets rims were elevated
;2.5 cm above substrate surface and ramped
with soil to allow access by lizards while
preventing ﬂooding, shaded by an elevated
(2.5–5.0 cm) lid and had a thin layer (2–4 cm) of
litter in the bottom to reduce trap-related mor-
tality. At each array, two 1.2 3 1.2-m plywood
basking substrates were placed on the ground in
random directions 10 m from the central bucket.
Each time arrays were visited, lizards at basking
substrates were captured using long-handled
butterﬂy nets. Arrays remained open .20 days/
month during June to September in 1997 and
May to September in 1998 and 1999. We checked
traps every two to three days to minimize trap
mortality. We collected data simultaneously at all
sites, employing 38 arrays in 1997, 70 arrays in
1998, and 56 arrays in 1999.
Lizard Variables.—All lizards captured received
a unique toe clip identiﬁcation, allowing us to
tally the relative abundance of each lizard species
at each array. We recorded snout–vent length
(SVL; mm), girth (mm), and mass (g) of all
lizards, and used these data to assign lizards to
hatchling, juvenile, and adult age class catego-
ries. Three age class categories are readily
identiﬁable during the active season for S.
graciosus, with little or no overlap in size (Mueller
and Moore, 1969; Tinkle, 1973). Our assignments
were also guided by descriptions of minimum
SVL at maturity from 14 studies on S. graciosus
reported in Tinkle et al. (1993). Although similar
published data do not exist for E. skiltonianus,
scatterplots of size class data for this species
segregated into three groups that we ascribed to
hatchling, juvenile, and adult age classes. Finally,
we indexed reproductive success of lizards
among arrays within each year as:
(no. hatchlings)/½(no. adults 1 1)
3 proportion adult $s
for S. graciosus because gender of this species is
easily determined (Stebbins, 1985) and
(no. hatchlings)/½(no. adults 1 1) 3 0:5 
for E. skiltonianus, since gender can not be
determined for this species in the ﬁeld.
Habitat Measurements.—We interpreted low-
elevation,
high-resolution aerial photographs
taken in 1997 to classify the entire study area
into major vegetative cover types. We drew
polygons delineating vegetative cover types on
photographs and then digitized them in Arc/
Info. We then ﬁeld-checked points randomly
located in all cover type assignments, and
assessed our accuracy in an error matrix (au-
thors, unpubl. data).
At the forest-stand scale, we collected habitat
data at each array using methods modiﬁed
from Noon (1981) and Clawson et al. (1984).
Stand-scale habitat data were collected in 0.2 ha

(25-m radius) plots centered on each pitfall array.
Slope and aspect were determined at plot center.
All trees within a 6-m wide belt extending north
to south and east to west across the diameter of
the plot were tallied by species and diameter at
breast height. Tree canopy closure (cc) was tallied
along 40 points spaced equidistant along the four
cardinal directions. We used point-quarter sam-
pling (Smith, 1980) to estimate volume (m3/ha)
of logs (.2.5-cm, .3-m length), surface area
(m2/ha) of rocks (.30-cm high), and indexed
presence of natural basking substrates as log
volume plus rock surface area.
We estimated percent ground surface covered
by duff (dead, organic, nonwoody and ,2.5-cm
diameter woody material), logs, rocks, shrubs,
grass, forbs, and bare soil along line transects
running north to south, east to west, northeast to
southwest, and northwest to southeast, totaling
160 m distance. Ground surface variables were
measured at all arrays in both 1998 and 1999 but
were not collected in 1997.
Data Analysis.—We recorded array locations
with a Trimble GPS receiver and superimposed
them on the GIS map of vegetative cover types.
We then visually compared 90% conﬁdence
intervals (CI) describing abundance of hatchling,
yearling, and adult lizards, and of reproductive
success, among vegetative cover types (Zar,
1996). Prior to comparisons, abundance and re-
productive success data were log-transformed to
improve distributions and variance homoge-
neity. To determine whether there was annual
replacement of female adult lizards in different
cover types, we examined 90% CI about values
of reproductive success using raw data; intervals
that
overlapped
or exceeded
one
indicated
annual reproductive replacement by females,
whereas intervals ,1 demonstrated failure of
adult females to replace themselves.
To identify natural groupings in and variation
among forest stands we submitted canopy clo-
sure, and ponderosa and deciduous tree density
data from all arrays to a cluster analysis (Systat
vers. 9, SPSS Inc., Chicago, 1999). We standard-
ized the data, and chose Pearson correlation as
a distance metric to remove the inﬂuence of
differences in scale among variables. We chose
these three variables because they are the primary
metrics of a presettlement restoration prescrip-
tion proposed for this area. Once array member-
ship within clusters was identiﬁed, we compared
relative abundance and reproductive success of
lizards among forest stand types in the same
manner as for vegetative cover types.
Finally,
to
identify
relationships
between
groundcover-substrate descriptors and lizards,
we grouped arrays by presence/absence for each
lizard species and tested for differences in ground
cover variables using Mann-Whitney U-tests.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Lizard Assemblage.—We sampled lizards over
6990 array-days during 1997–1999 (1238, 3943,
and 1809 days/yr, respectively). We documented
a ﬁve-species lizard assemblage numerically dom-
inated by S. graciosus, which comprised 65, 81,
and 85% of sampled individuals, and occurred
at 22/38, 61/70, and 44/56 arrays each year, re-
spectively. Eumeces skiltonianus comprised 34, 18,
and 12% of captured individuals and occurred
at 19/38, 39/70, and 22/56 arrays each year, re-
spectively. Sceloporus undulatus, Cnemidophorus
velox, and Phrynosoma douglasii accounted for the
remaining 1–3% of lizards sampled each year.
Lizard-Vegetative
Cover
Relationships.—The
northern half of the study area was covered by
ponderosa-deciduous-pinyon-juniper (17 arrays)
and ponderosa-pinyon-juniper (7 arrays) mixed
forest types, whereas the southern half was
covered primarily by pure ponderosa (23 arrays)
and ponderosa-deciduous (20 arrays) forest in-
terspersed with pockets of other vegetative types.
Small meadows (3 arrays) containing grasses and
sagebrush were distributed throughout the study
area. Distribution of arrays reﬂected proportional
area of cover types. Only data from 1998 and
1999 are presented for comparisons among
vegetative cover types because arrays were not
present in all vegetative types in 1997.
Sceloporus graciosus abundance varied less
among cover types as lizards became older
(Appendix 1). In both 1998 and 1999, hatchling
S. graciosus were more abundant in meadows
than in any other vegetative cover type, with no
other differences in either year. In 1998, juvenile S.
graciosus abundance was higher in ponderosa-
deciduous forest and ponderosa-deciduous-pin-
yon-juniper forest than in pure ponderosa forest,
with intermediate abundances in ponderosa-
pinyon-juniper forest and meadows. In 1999,
juvenile abundance was higher in ponderosa-
deciduous forest and meadows than in any other
vegetative cover, with no other differences (Ap-
pendix 1). Adult S. graciosus abundance did not
differ among vegetative cover types in either year.
Reproductive success averaged .3 times higher
in meadows than in any forested cover type in
both years, differing between meadows (higher)
and pure ponderosa forest in 1998 and trending
toward this in 1999 (Appendix 1). In addition,
female S. graciosus replaced themselves only in
meadows and ponderosa-deciduous forest.
Eumeces skiltonianus responded increasingly to
vegetative cover variation with increasing lizard
age, and was more abundant in forested cover
types than in meadows (Appendix 1). Hatchling
E. skiltonianus abundance did not vary among
vegetative cover types in either year. Juvenile E.
skiltonianus in 1998 were more abundant in pure
LIZARDS IN A PONDEROSA PINE FOREST

ponderosa and ponderosa-deciduous forest than
meadows but otherwise did not vary. In 1999,
juvenile abundance was higher in ponderosa-
deciduous-pinyon-juniper forest than in either
meadows or ponderosa-deciduous forest. In both
years, adult E. skiltonianus were more abundant
in pure ponderosa and ponderosa-deciduous-
pinyon-juniper forest than in meadows, where
they were absent (Appendix 1). In 1999, adults
were also not detected in ponderosa-pinyon-
juniper forest. Although reproductive success did
not vary among vegetative cover in either year,
adult female E. skiltonianus replaced themselves
in meadows and ponderosa-pinyon-juniper for-
est in both years, and also in pure ponderosa
and ponderosa-deciduous-pinyon-juniper forest
in 1998.
Lizard-Stand Scale Habitat Relationships.—The
cluster analysis generated ﬁve forest stand types
based on values of canopy closure and stem
density of ponderosa pine and deciduous trees
(Table 1). Cluster one contained savannah-like
plots with a low density of small diameter
ponderosa trees and low percent canopy closure.
Cluster two described stands with higher de-
ciduous (oak and locust) composition than co-
niferous. Cluster three was characterized by high
canopy closure, intermediate density ponderosa
stands. Cluster four described intermediate can-
opy closure and ponderosa density, and the
lowest deciduous density. Cluster ﬁve contained
close-canopied, high-density ponderosa stands.
Neither slope (Kruskal-Wallis P 5 0.925) nor as-
pect (ANOVA P 5 0.655) differed among clusters.
Relative abundance of all S. graciosus age
classes and reproductive success were highest
in open stand types and decreased as stand
density and canopy closure increased (Appendix
2). In 1997, abundance of hatchling S. graciosus
did not vary among forest stand types. However,
in 1998, hatchling S. graciosus were more abun-
dant in savannah-like stands than in high-density
ponderosa stands, with no other differences. In
1999, hatchling S. graciosus were more abundant
in savannah-like stands than in deciduous-
dominated stands or either of the high canopy-
closure
ponderosa
stand
types,
and
more
abundant in deciduous stands than in high-
density ponderosa stands (Appendix 2). Juvenile
S. graciosus were more abundant in deciduous-
dominated stands than in high-density ponder-
osa stands in 1997, and more abundant in
savannah-like and deciduous stands than in
intermediate-density, high canopy-closure pon-
derosa stands in either year, and high-density
ponderosa stands in 1999 (Appendix 2). In 1997,
abundance of adult S. graciosus did not differ
among forest stand types, whereas in 1998
abundance was higher in deciduous-dominated
stands than high-density ponderosa stands. In
1999, adult S. graciosus abundance was higher in
intermediate-density,
intermediate
canopy-
closure ponderosa stands than in deciduous-
dominated
stands,
intermediate-density
high
canopy-closure, or high-density ponderosa
stands (Appendix 2). Sceloporus graciosus repro-
ductive success in 1998 was higher in savannah-
like stands than in high-density ponderosa
stands. Reproductive success of S. graciosus was
higher in 1999 in savannah-like stands than in
either
intermediate-density
ponderosa
stand
types or the high-density ponderosa stands,
and was also higher in deciduous-dominated
stands than in high-density ponderosa stands
(Appendix 2). In both years, adult S. graciosus
females replaced themselves in savannah-like
forest stands; they also replaced themselves in
deciduous stands in 1998 but did not in any other
stand type in either year. Our data suggest that
dispersal from meadows and savannahs into
other cover and stand types may be important in
maintaining S. graciosus in habitat types where
reproductive replacement did not occur (Pulliam,
1988). Tinkle (1973), working in a similar ponder-
osa forest in southern Utah, found S. graciosus
abundance highest in sagebrush ﬂats. Other

studies have associated S. graciosus with open
habitat types containing shrubs under which
they thermoregulate, escape predation, and hunt
(Marcellini and Mackey, 1970; Rose, 1976).
Hatchling E. skiltonianus abundance differed in
1997 only, being higher in deciduous-dominated
stands than in intermediate-density and canopy-
closure or high-density ponderosa stands. Juve-
nile E. skiltonianus abundance was higher in
deciduous-dominated
stands
than
in
high-
density ponderosa stands in all three years, and
also higher than in either intermediate-density
ponderosa stand type in 1998 and 1999 (Appen-
dix 2). Adult E. skiltonianus abundance did not
differ among forest stand types in 1997 or 1998
but was higher in deciduous-dominated stands
than in high-density ponderosa stands in 1999
(Appendix 2).
Reproductive success for E. skiltonianus did
not differ among forest stands in 1998 or 1999
(Appendix 2). In 1998, E. skiltonianus females
replaced themselves in savannah-like stands and
both
intermediate-density
ponderosa
stand
types, whereas in 1999 they replaced themselves
only in savannah-like stands and in high-density
ponderosa stands. Deciduous stands were the
only type in which adult female E. skiltonianus
did not replace themselves in either year. Eumeces
skiltonianus forage in and under leaf litter (Behler
and King, 1995), and all age classes may have
been exploiting high amounts of duff in de-
ciduous stands. Block and Morrison (1998) found
a similar positive association between E. skilto-
nianus and California black oaks (Quercus kellog-
gii) in California but did not separate ages or
examine reproductive success.
Lizard-Substrate
Habitat
Relationships.—The
ratio of organic duff versus bare ground was
signiﬁcantly lower in plots in which S. graciosus
was present in both 1998 (means 5 19.0 6 3.1
SE vs. 45.8 6 9.8; P 5 0.003) and 1999 (17.2 6 3.0
vs. 31.5 6 11.9; P 5 0.02). However, S. graciosus
occurred across the full range of duff:bare
sampled. In addition in 1998, plots where
S. graciosus was present had fewer log and
rock basking substrates (1666.0 6 358.3 vs.
3577.1 6 1118.1; P 5 0.04), and greater percent
ground covered by forbs (6.2 6 1.2 vs. 0.8 6 0.5;
P 5 0.04).
Percent ground covered by organic duff was
lower in plots where E. skiltonianus was present
in both 1998 (61.3 6 2.7 vs. 70.7 6 3.9; P 5 0.002)
and 1999 (58.764.0 versus 70.463.1; P 5 0.013).
Percent ground surface covered by organic duff
ranged from 3.8–91.3%, however, E. skiltonianus
was never present in plots containing less than
16.9% or more than 86.9% ground covered by
duff. In 1998, the ratio of duff versus bare ground
was also lower in plots where E. skiltonianus was
present (18.9 6 3.9 vs. 27.3 6 5.2; P 5 0.05).
Conclusions.—The ponderosa forest we exam-
ined was dominated by higher tree densities
and less herbaceous ground cover than prior to
cessation of natural ﬁre regimes (Fule´ et al., 1997;
Mast et al., 1999), and tree encroachment into
meadows was plainly evident. Greenberg et al.
(1994) concluded that the closing of forest stands
after ﬁre suppression in Florida served as a major
fragmenting agent for lizard populations. Ballin-
ger and Watts (1995) determined that when
management prescriptions excluded natural dis-
turbance
factors
such
as
periodic
ﬁre
in
Nebraska, lizard species dependent upon dis-
turbed
habitats
declined
or
became
locally
extinct. Comparing burned and unburned co-
niferous forest in central Arizona, Cunningham
et al. (2000) found that average abundance
increased 4.3 3 for Sceloporus undulatus and 8.8
3 for Cnemidophorus velox in burned areas over
four years postﬁre. Both of these species were
present but extremely rare on our study area.
Comparisons in other ﬁre-dependent ecosystems
have documented similar responses by lizards in
burned areas (Lillywhite, 1977; Mushinsky, 1985).
We found lizard reproduction and replacement
highest in the most open habitat types present.
Sceloporus graciosus abundance and reproduction
were consistently
highest
in
meadows
and
savannahs, and lowest in forested cover types,
especially high-density ponderosa forest. We
found E. skiltonianus more abundant in ponderosa
and mixed-deciduous forest cover than in mead-
ows, but it became less abundant as stand-scale
ponderosa stem density increased and replaced
itself in meadows and savannahs in both years.
Meadow and ponderosa savannah habitats were
most similar to those reported historically com-
mon (Fule´ et al., 1997; Mast et al., 1999) but were
disappearing with long-term ﬁre suppression.
These changes may have limited lizard distribu-
tion and reproductive success in our study area to
a fraction of the area in which they occurred ;125
years ago. If steps are not taken to reverse the
trend toward increasing ponderosa density, these
lizard species may become further restricted
within this ponderosa forest landscape.
