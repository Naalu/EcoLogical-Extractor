Abstract
We assessed species composition, richness and abundance of understory vegetation, as well as arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)
inoculum potential on the San Francisco Peaks, tallest mountains in Arizona, crossing a steep, south-facing elevational gradient.
These mountains have a high conservation value due to their rare habitats but previous vegetation studies have been limited.
Because mature trees in the Pinaceae do not form associations with AM fungi, there may be more variation in plant community
and AM fungal associations in coniferous forest than in ecosystems where all species associate with AM fungi. Differences in
species composition between forest types reﬂected differences in the historical disturbance regimes. Species richness was
highest in ponderosa pine forest (32.6  1.4 per 1000 m2 plot), although plant abundance was highest in aspen forest (49.4 
3.8%). Ponderosa pine and bristlecone pine forest were both high in species richness and contained species which were tolerant
of frequent, low-intensity ﬁre. Exotic species richness and abundance were highest in the lower elevations, which were also areas
of high species richness and greater anthropogenic disturbance. Arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculum potential varied widely (1.2–
80.1%), decreasing with increases in tree cover. We suggest indicator species that may be of use in monitoring these forests
under changing climate and ﬁre regimes.

1. Introduction
By affecting temperature and precipitation, eleva-
tion gradients are important drivers of plant commu-
nity associations. Merriam (1890) used the San
Francisco Peaks in Arizona to point out the similarities
between high latitude and high altitude plant commu-
nities. His ‘‘life zones’’ concept implicitly agreed with
the theory, later championed by Clements (1916), of
communities as discrete units. Gleason (1926) argued
for individualistic plant associations by pointing out
that transition zones between vegetation types are
wider where elevation gradients are more gradual.
Neither Gleason’s nor Clements’s theories completely

describe community distributions, but current theory
retains elements from both (Shipley and Keddy, 1987;
Callaway, 1997). Numerous studies of elevation gra-
dients, such as those in the United States’ Santa
Catalina and Great Smoky Mountains and Israel’s
Mount Hermon, supported Gleason’s argument by
ﬁnding little overlap in plant species distributions
(Whittaker, 1965; Whittaker and Niering, 1968; Auer-
bach and Shimda, 1993; Sagers and Lyon, 1997).
However, dominant species may affect community
composition by modifying the local environment
(Collins et al., 1993; Hoagland and Collins, 1997).
Furthermore, species can affect the distributions of
other species even if their distributions are non-over-
lapping (Callaway, 1997; Callaway and Walker,
1997). A global study on plant interactions along
elevation gradients found interactions between plants
change from competition to facilitation as abiotic
stress increases (Choler et al., 2001; Callaway et
al., 2002), underscoring the importance of interactions
between biotic as well as abiotic factors in determin-
ing species distributions (Callaway, 1997).
Changes in disturbance regimes across elevation
have an important inﬂuence on plant communities
(Harmon et al., 1983). Prior to settlement by Euro-
Americans, ﬁre was a frequent disturbance in the
ponderosa pine forests of the southwestern United
States; its exclusion is theorized to have caused dra-
matic changes including decreases in herbaceous pro-
duction and decomposition rates and increases in tree
density and fuel loads (Covington and Moore, 1994).
Landscape biodiversity and abundance of native plants
adapted to low-intensity ﬁre may decline without ﬁre
disturbance (Keane et al., 2002; Beier and Maschinski,
2003; Korb and Springer, 2003). Fire exclusion is also
a factor in decreasing aspen forests on the San Fran-
cisco Peaks and across the west, as old aspen stands
become replaced by conifers (Kay, 1997; Turner et al.,
2003).
Most previous gradient studies have compared
plant communities solely to changes in the abiotic
environment (Callaway, 1997), overlooking the role of
arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM), which form
mutualistic to possibly parasitic associations with
plants and affect plant ﬁtness and competitive inter-
actions (Allen and Allen, 1990; Johnson et al., 1997;
Wilson and Hartnett, 1998; Hart et al., 2003). Almost
all vascular plant species, with the notable exception
of mature (non-seedling) coniferous trees in the Pina-
ceae, can function as hosts for arbuscular mycorrhizal
fungi (Mosse et al., 1981). AM are commonly known
to assist host plants with phosphorous uptake, but may
also provide other beneﬁts including protection from
fungal pathogens, assisting with the uptake of other
nutrients such as nitrogen and copper, and improving
water relations (Newsham et al., 1995). In return, AM
fungi receive photosynthetic products from the host
plant.
There is abundant evidence that AM fungi inﬂu-
ence plant species composition and richness in grass-
lands (Grime et al., 1987; Gange et al., 1993; Wilson
and Hartnett, 1997; Hartnett and Wilson, 1999). These
studies have compared plants grown in the presence of
AM fungi to the absence of AM fungi. However, AM
fungi are thought to be ubiquitous in undisturbed
grassland soils (Allen et al., 1995), therefore changes
in AM species composition probably have greater
ecological relevance in grasslands than AM presence
alone (van der Heijden et al., 1998a, 1998b; Hart et al.,
2003; Klironomos, 2003). In coniferous forests domi-
nated by species in the Pinaceae, where the trees form
associations almost exclusively with ectomycorrhizae,
differences in AM inoculum could be more dramatic
(Trappe, 1962; Ahlenslager, 1987; Benjamin et al.,
1989). Although there are few studies of AM fungi in
coniferous (Pinaceae) forest ecosystems, all have
found decreasing colonization with increasing live
tree cover (Kovacic et al., 1984; Korb et al., 2003b;
Gildar et al., 2004) and AM colonization is low near
alpine summits (Read and Haselwandter, 1981). If the
presence of AM fungi alters the competitive balance
between understory plants in coniferous forest, eco-
logical implications could include changing the speed
of plant community shifts under climate change sce-
narios or modifying the nutritive value of vegetation
(McNaughton and Oesterheld, 1990; Perry et al.,
1990).
In this study we assessed the herbaceous vegetation
and AM inoculum potential on the San Francisco
Peaks, crossing a steep, south-facing elevational gra-
dient. Over 130 years after Merriam (1890) studies,
the San Francisco Peaks remain a useful area to study
vegetation distributions because they support repre-
sentatives of all southwestern forest types arrayed
along a steep elevation gradient. We expected that:
(1) the species composition, richness, and abundance
M.A. Fisher, P.Z. Fule´ / Forest Ecology and Management 200 (2004) 293–311
294

of the understory vegetation would differ between
forest types covering different elevational bands. Spe-
cies richness was expected to decline with elevation,
with the lowest species richness in bristlecone pine
forest, except aspen vegetation was expected to have
the highest species richness and species abundance.
(2) Exotic plants were expected to be distributed in
accordance with two hypotheses: ﬁrst, communities
with fewer natives would be the most heavily invaded;
second, exotics would dominate where disturbance
was more prevalent. Due to past management and
modern recreation, there was more disturbance at the
bottom of the San Francisco Peaks, so lower elevations
were expected to have greater richness and abundance
of exotic species. (3) AM inoculum potential was
expected to decrease with increases in tree cover.
2. Study area
We conducted our study on the south face of the
San Francisco Peaks within the Coconino National
Forest in northern Arizona, centered on latitude
358180, longitude 1118410 (Fig. 1). The ‘‘Peaks’’ are
actually the caldera of a single extinct volcano. Three
peaks around the caldera, Humphreys, Agassiz, and
Fremont Peaks, are the highest points in Arizona
(3851, 3766, and 3648 m respectively). Because of
its volcanic origin, soil parent material is primarily
andesite, ryholite and basalt. Soils are chieﬂy incepti-
sols, alﬁsols, and mollisols (Terrestrial Ecosystems
Survey, Anon, 1995). A weather station at 2240 m,
slightly lower in elevation than our study area, records
average annual precipitation of 56 cm. Average July
maximum temperature is 27 8C and average January
minimum temperature is 12 8C (Western Regional
Climate Center, Anon, 2003). Over a 1000 m elevation
increase on the San Francisco Peaks, precipitation
increases by 11 cm while temperatures decrease by
6.89 8C (Pearson, 1920). Ponderosa pine, the most
common forest type in northern Arizona and New
Mexico, is found in the lowest elevations (Brown,
1994). Higher elevation forest types, rare in the South-
west, are remnant populations that have become iso-
lated in the current interglacial period (Schaack, 1983;
Brown, 1994). These forests include mixed conifer
forest, dominated by Douglas-ﬁr and limber pine,
aspen stands, spruce/ﬁr forest, and bristlecone pine
forest. Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine trees are
found only in the highest elevations of Arizona, Color-
ado, and New Mexico (Brunstein and Yamaguchi,
1992). The San Francisco Peaks culminate in the only
tundra vegetation in Arizona (Rominger and Paulik,
1983; Schaack, 1983; Brown, 1994).
Since Euro-American settlement (circa, 1876), the
San Francisco Peaks were used for summer grazing of
sheep and cattle starting in the 1870s, peaking around
1915 (Cline, 1994). Lower elevation ponderosa pine
and mixed conifer forests were logged, though higher
elevation forests were excluded from harvest because
of the steep terrain. Since the Kachina Peaks Wild-
erness Area was established in 1984, it has received an
increasing number of recreational visitors and a down-
hill ski area operates on 137 acres on the west side of
the mountain (Aitchison, 1989).
3. Methods
We assessed plant community composition, site
conditions, and overstory tree conditions on 121 plots
located systematically on a 300 m grid that extended
from ponderosa pine forest at 2442 m to timberline at
3569 m (Fig. 1). We were only examining the unders-
tory within the context of a forested overstory, so if a
plot origin fell in a meadow or other unforested
location, we attempted to relocate the plot 50 m to
the N, E, W, or S. If these were also unforested we did
not establish the plot.
Plot design was based on the National Park Ser-
vice’s Fire Monitoring protocol (National Park Ser-
vice, 1992). Plots were 20 m  50 m (1000 m2), with
the longer axis oriented uphill to capture the elevation
gradient and enable correction of the plot area for
slope. Plot corners and center were permanently
marked with iron stakes placed ﬂush to the forest
ﬂoor. We recorded the distance and direction from a
tagged reference tree to the plot center and recorded
GPS coordinates, slope, azimuth and elevation of the
plot.
Each plot was measured once between the years
2000 and 2003. Sampling took 4 years because plots
all had to be reached on foot, forests were closed to
research in 2000 and 2002 due to extreme drought, and
a wildﬁre in 2001 also closed the forest for several
weeks. We do not believe the year a plot was sampled

295

had a signiﬁcant effect on our results, for the following
reasons. First, representatives of all ﬁve forest types
were sampled in 2000, 2001 and 2003. This meant that
between-year sampling did not duplicate the results
between forest types. In 2002, only three plots were
sampled, all of which were bristlecone pine forest.
This is a small proportion of the 21 bristlecone pine
plots, and therefore should not sway the results.
Although climatic conditions differed between sam-
pling years, all years were somewhat similar in that
precipitation was below average. Finally, independent
samples t-tests did not detect differences in species
richness or composition between sampling years.
All trees on the 1000 m2 plot with a diameter at
breast height (dbh) greater than 15 cm were measured;
trees with dbh 2.5–15 cm were measured on a 250 m2

subplot and trees < 2.5 cm dbh were measured on a
50 m2 subplot. For each tree we recorded dbh, crown
base height, total height, damage and decay class of
snags (Thomas et al., 1979).
Herbaceous plant abundance was measured on two
point-line intercept transects per plot, running along
the 50 m plot boundaries. Every 30 cm we recorded all
species encountered, height of the tallest species, and
underlying substrate (litter, rock, etc.). To calculate
plant abundance, we divided the number of plants
encountered on each point-line intercept transect by
332, the total number of points sampled per plot. Since
more than one plant could be encountered at a single
point, it was possible for plant abundance to exceed
one. We measured tree canopy cover by vertical
projection every 3 m along each 50 m plot boundary.
We recorded presence/absence of all vascular plant
species on a belt transect (10 m  50 m) centered on
each point-line intercept transect.
Soil samples were collected in 2002 for measuring
AM fungal inoculum potential on 75 of the 121 plots.
We chose plots that were established no later than
2002, were not burned in a 2001 wildﬁre that covered
part of the study area, were located in Fig. 1. Soil
sampling plots ranged in elevation from 2442 to
3559 m, only 10 m less than the elevation range for
the full study area.
Plant species can have signiﬁcant effects on the
fungal communities beneath them (Bever et al., 1996;
Eom et al., 2000). Therefore, we chose to sample
under grasses, rather than at random points on the plot,
to conﬁrm that any mycorrhizal differences we
encountered were not an artifact of changes in the
presence or abundance of certain species. We recorded
the grass species under which the sample was taken.
We collected soil by clearing away the organic layer,
then pounding a 3.8 cm diameter pipe 15 cm into the
ground. We took two soil cores from underneath the
clump of grass closest to the center of each point-line
intercept transect.
Roots from one of each of the paired soil samples
were elutriated, dried, and weighed to estimate the
root biomass available as a mycorrhizal inoculant. The
other paired soil sample was transported to the lab in
the soil corer for a corn bioassay to determine mycor-
rhizal inoculum potential (Johnson et al., 1999). The
purpose of using an intact soil core was to retain
root and AM hyphal networks substantially intact
(Klironomos and Hart, 2002). We covered the bottom
of the corer with shade cloth to prevent soil loss but
allow water drainage, and then planted a germinated
corn seedling (Zea mays) in the soil core. After 6
weeks, we harvested the corn plants. To assess percent
colonization by AM fungi, we harvested, stained, and
scored the roots using the grid-line intersect method
(Johnson et al., 1999).
To test for greenhouse contamination, we planted
corn seedlings in steam-sterilized soil in ﬁve addi-
tional cores. AM colonization in the controls ranged
between 0% and 5.5% (mean 2.8  1.0%). Therefore
only about 2–4% of the colonization we observed
could be due to greenhouse contamination. Any fun-
gus we saw in the roots that could not be positively
identiﬁed as AM was listed as non-mycorrhizal. Olpi-
dium spp. and dark septate were noted in the roots, but
as no trends were noted with those species they were
all grouped together for analysis. All control plants
were entirely free of non-AM fungi.
3.1. Data analysis
We categorized each plot into one of ﬁve forest
types based on an importance value for each tree
species calculated from the sum of the relative fre-
quency (percent stems) and relative abundance (per-
cent basal area) (Taylor, 2000). If the highest
importance value on a given plot was Pinus ponder-
osa, Populus tremuloides, or Pinus aristata, we
assigned it to the ponderosa pine, aspen, or bristlecone
pine forest type, respectively. If the highest impor-
tance value was for Pinus ﬂexilis or Pseudotsuga
menziesii (limber pine or Douglas-ﬁr), we assigned
it to the mixed conifer forest type. If the highest
importance value was for Abies lasiocarpa var. ari-
zonica or Picea englemannii (corkbark ﬁr or Engle-
mann spruce) we assigned it to the spruce/ﬁr forest
type. Henceforth in this paper, the scientiﬁc names are
used to refer to individual tree species, while common
names are used to refer to forest types (e.g., ‘‘ponder-
osa pine forest’’ or ‘‘spruce/ﬁr forest’’).
Due to the long sampling period and difﬁcult
access, it was not possible to conduct all the plant
measurements under ideal phenological conditions.
Some understory plants were difﬁcult to identify in
the ﬁeld, so it was necessary to group certain taxa by
genus for analysis (e.g., Bromus anomalus and Bromus
M.A. Fisher, P.Z. Fule´ / Forest Ecology and Management 200 (2004) 293–311
297

ciliatus were called Bromus spp.). For this reason,
species richness and species diversity measures are
underestimates.
Total plant abundance, exotic plant abundance,
abundances of individual species and groups of species,
and species diversity (Shannon’s H0) were calculated
from point-line intercept data. We used the data from
the belt transect to calculate species richness.
Multivariate community analyses were carried out
with PC-Ord software (McCune and Mefford, 1999).
We used nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS)
to visualize differences in plant community composi-
tion. In NMDS analyses, we used Sørenson distance
with a random starting conﬁguration and 40 runs with
real data. We used 50 runs with randomized data in the
Monte Carlo test. We choose the highest dimensionality
that yielded a ﬁnal stress lower than 95%. We decided
our solution was sufﬁciently stable when we reached an
instability <0.0001 or 500 iterations.
Differences in community composition were tested
with multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP).
MRPP creates a distance matrix between group mem-
bers, then compares the within group distances and the
between group distances of random permutations to
the actual groups. MRPP output is composed of a P-
value and the chance-corrected within-group agree-
ment (A), a measure of effect size. Our MRPP analyses
were done using Euclidean distance.
Indicator species analysis was used to identify
species that were particularly faithful and/or exclusive
to individual forest types (McCune and Grace, 2002).
A comparison between the maximum indicator value
of a species (ranging between 0 and 100) and rando-
mized trials for the occurrence of that species (1000
randomizations in the Monte Carlo test) yields a P-
value. To be a perfect indicator value, a species would
need to be found on all plots in a forest type and not
found on any plots of any other forest types. We
accepted species with indicator values 25 and P-
values 0.05 as indicator species.
We used Mantel tests to ﬁnd correlations between
different sets of data taken on the same set of plots.
The output from a Mantel test is a standardized Mantel
statistic (r) that indicates the strength of the correlation
between the distance matrices of the two data sets and
a P-value. We chose Mantel’s asymptotic approxima-
tion to evaluate test statistics.SPSS for Windows
(2002) was used for parametric and nonparametric
univariate analyses. All variables used in parametric
tests were checked for normality and equal variance
by conﬁrming the Shapiro-Wilk’s and Levene’s test
statistics were both >0.05. Statistically signiﬁcant
differences
between
sampled
populations
were
assessed with t-tests or ANOVA. Alpha level for all
tests of statistical signiﬁcance was 0.05. Individual
means were compared following signiﬁcant ANOVAs
using Tukey’s HSD post hoc test. Variables that did not
meet the assumptions for parametric statistics were
assessed with nonparametric methods of analysis.
ANOVA’s were replaced with Kruskal-Wallis tests
and t-tests were replaced with Wilcoxon Signed Ranks
tests. We used Pearson’s correlations to look for
relationships between factors. The N was consistent
for all correlations because zero data values were not
excluded.
4. Results
4.1. Vegetation distribution
The sampling grid included 26 ponderosa pine, 27
mixed conifer, 37 aspen, 10 spruce/ﬁr and 21 bristle-
cone pine plots (Table 1). In a companion study, Cocke
(2004) showed that the sampling grid was representa-
tive of the actual proportions of each forest type in the
study area, as measured by classiﬁed satellite imagery.
Plant community composition differed between the
ﬁve forest types (MRPP, A = 0.08, P < 0.01). Mixed
conifer and aspen appeared to have the most similar
community composition (Fig. 2). The vegetation types
at opposite ends of the elevational gradient, ponderosa
pine and bristlecone pine, shared traits of high species
richness and low canopy cover. Plant community
composition was correlated with the environmental
variables canopy cover, elevation, exotic species rich-
ness, plant abundance, slope, Shannon’s H0 diversity
index, species richness, and forest type (Mantel test, r
= 0.54, P < 0.01).
Forest types were differentiated both by species
richness (ANOVA, F(4, 116) = 7.29, P < 0.01) and
canopy cover (ANOVA, F(4, 116) = 11.749, P < 0.01)
(Table 1). Shannon’s H0 diversity index did not vary
between vegetation types. Canopy cover and species
richness were inversely related (r = 0.48, P < 0.01).
Species richness in ponderosa pine forest (average
M.A. Fisher, P.Z. Fule´ / Forest Ecology and Management 200 (2004) 293–311
298

32.6 species/1000 m2 plot) was signiﬁcantly higher
than all forest types except bristlecone pine. Bristle-
cone pine and ponderosa pine, the two forest types
with least canopy cover, differed from the two forest
types with greatest cover, aspen and mixed conifer.
Plant abundance also varied between forest types
(Kruskal-Wallis, x2
(4) = 29.46, P < 0.01) and was not
correlated with richness. Plant abundance was 36%
higher in aspen than in ponderosa pine, the forest type
with the next highest plant abundance. Populus tre-
muloides was the only tree species whose basal area
was positively associated with plant abundance (r =
0.49, P < 0.01). Nitrogen ﬁxing plants were more
abundant on plots with high P. tremuloides basal area
(N ﬁxers: r = 0.72, P < 0.01).
Pinus ponderosa basal area and plant abundance
were negatively related (r = 0.23, P = 0.01). In
particular, high P. ponderosa basal area was associated
with low abundances of nitrogen ﬁxing plants and
shrubs (N ﬁxers: r = 0.32, P < 0.01; shrub: r =
0.22, P = 0.01). Plant abundance was inversely
related to basal area of Pseudotsuga menziesii and
both tree species associated with spruce/ﬁr forest (P.
menziesii: r = 0.24, P = 0.01; Picea englemannii: r =

0.02). Pinus aristata was the only species to be
signiﬁcantly positively associated with shrub abun-
dance (r = 0.55, P < 0.01).
Fourteen indicator species were identiﬁed for pon-
derosa pine forest, four for mixed conifer, none for
aspen, two for spruce/ﬁr, and eight for bristlecone pine
forest (Table 2). Abundances of all three grasses that
were ponderosa pine indicator species were positively
correlated with species richness (Muhlenbergia Mon-
tana: r = 0.54, P < 0.01; Elymus elymoides: r = 0.36, P
< 0.01; Festuca arizonica: r = 0.35, P < 0.01). There
were also positive correlations between the abun-
dances of ponderosa pine indicator species and species
richness of N-ﬁxing plants (E. elymoides: r = 0.52, P <
0.01; F. arizonica: r = 0.47, P < 0.01; M. Montana: r =
0.45, P < 0.01; Lupinus spp.: r = 0.25, P < 0.01). Of
the mixed conifer indicator species, Mahonia repens
was associated with plots that had high canopy cover
(r = 0.23, P = 0.01). Two bristlecone pine indicator
species were more abundant on plots with high species
richness (Festuca ovina: r = 0.21, P = 0.02; Erigeron
spp.: r = 0.21, P = 0.02). There was an inverse
relationship between the abundances of bristlecone
pine indicator species and richness of nitrogen ﬁxing
species (Ribes montigenum: r = 0.33, P < 0.01;
Penstemon whippleanus: r = 0.33, P < 0.01; Festuca
ovina: r = 0.27, P < 0.01). Penstemon whippleanus
abundance was correlated with the percent cover of
soil (r = 0.21, P = 0.02).
4.2. Exotic species
Native plant community composition on plots with
exotic species differed from native plant composition
on plots without exotics (MRPP, A = 0.01, P < 0.01).
Plots with exotic species tended to be those with low
canopy cover and high species richness (Fig. 3).
Exotic species richness differed between forest types

(Kruskal-Wallis x2
(4) = 9.84, P = 0.04). Mean exotic
species richness was nearly twice as high in ponderosa
pine as in bristlecone pine and aspen forests, which
had the next highest exotic species richness (Table 1).
Exotic species richness was positively correlated with
both native species richness and native plant abun-
dance (native richness: r = 0.46, P < 0.01; native
abundance: r = 0.41, P < 0.01). However, exotic
species richness was inversely related to canopy cover
and elevation (canopy: r = 0.39, P < 0.01; elevation:
r = 0.19, P = 0.04).
Abundance of exotic species showed similar trends
to exotic species richness and the two variables were
positively correlated (r = 0.58, P< 0.01). Exotic plant
abundance was positively correlated with native plant
abundance and native species richness (native abun-
dance: r = 0.54, P < 0.01; native richness: r = 0.20, P =
0.03). Exotic plant abundance also decreased with
increasing canopy cover (r = 0.18, P = 0.05). Exotics
accounted for no more than 6% of plant encounters on
any given plot.
Of the 200 different species encountered in this
study there were 11 exotic species, 187 native species,
and two which we could only identify to genus making
us uncertain of their origin. The exotic species were
Bromus inermis, B. tectorum, Dactylis glomerata,
Lactuca serriola, Linaria dalmatica, Poa compressa,
P. pratensis, Sanguisorba minor, Taraxacum ofﬁci-
nale, Tragopogon dubius, and Verbascum thapsus.
We also found a Chenopodium that may be the exotic
C. album or the native C. berlandieri. We counted this
Chenopodium as a native species in our analysis.
The patterns of distribution of individual exotic
species varied with elevation (Fig. 4). Taraxacum
ofﬁcinale was the only exotic species we encountered
frequently enough (37% of belts) to analyze its indi-
vidual abundance. T. ofﬁcinale was more abundant on
plots high in abundance of both exotic and native
species (exotic abundance: r = 0.56, P < 0.01; native
abundance: r = 0.33, P < 0.01) and was positively
correlated with exotic species richness and native
species richness (exotic richness: r = 0.58, P <

0.01; native richness: r = 0.32, P < 0.01). Plots with
little canopy cover also had more T. ofﬁcinale (r=
0.24, P = 0.01). T. ofﬁcinale was the most common
(or only) exotic species in the higher elevation sites
(Fig. 4). Excluding T. ofﬁcinale from exotic species
richness resulted in a larger negative correlation with
elevation (excluding T. ofﬁcinale: r = 0.34, P < 0.01;
including T. ofﬁcinale: r = 0.19, P = 0.04).
Nine native species were indicators for plots with
exotic species and six native species indicated plots
without exotics (Table 3). Abundance of indicator
species for plots with exotic species was positively
correlated with native species richness and abundance
as well as exotic species richness and abundance
(Table 4).

A total of 135 soil samples were collected: 14 in
ponderosa pine, 33 in mixed conifer, 59 in aspen, 10 in
spruce/ﬁr, and 19 in bristlecone pine forest. We
sampled soil under eight species of plants: the C3
grasses Bromusspp., Elymus elymoides, Festuca ari-
zonica, Pascopyrum smithii, and Poa fendleriana, and

the C4 grasses Blepharoneuron tricholepis, Muhlen-
bergia montana, and M. virescens. Only two samples
were collected under Pascopyrum smithii and three
under Blepharoneuron tricholepis. This was insufﬁ-
cient to provide an adequate idea of the variation
within those species, so they were not included in
the analysis by species.
Plots with high understory plant abundance had
higher AM fungal colonization (Table 1), although
this accounted for only a small amount of the varia-
bility (regression, F(1, 134) = 4.87, P = 0.03, r2 = 0.04).
Percentage AM fungal colonization was positively
associated with high species richness and low basal
area (species richness: r = 0.18, P = 0.04; basal area: r
= 0.20, P = 0.02). Neither the richness nor abun-
dance of exotic species was related to AM coloniza-
tion. AM fungal colonization and non-AM fungal
colonization were also positively correlated (r =
0.40, P < 0.01). Root biomass available as inoculant
was not related to percent AM colonization.
AM colonization differed based on the grass it was
collected under (ANOVA F(5,124) = 2.90, P = 0.02).
AM colonization was highest in corn plants grown in
soil from under Muhlenbergia virescens (38.4 
11.8%). This was 240% higher than AM colonization
of corn grown in Bromus spp. soil (16.1  1.9%) and
300% higher than corn grown in Poa fendleriana soil
(12.8  2.5%).
Bromus spp., M. montana, and F. arizonica were
the only three grass species under which we collected
more than ten soil samples (23, 39, and 49 samples,
respectively). Soil samples from under each of these
species spanned an elevation range greater than 850 m
and were occurred in all ﬁve forest types. In soil
collected
under
M.
montana,
AM
colonization
increased with elevation (regression, F(1, 37) = 7.37,
P = 0.01, r2 = 0.17). AM colonization did not change
with elevation from soil collected under Bromus spp.,
F. arizonica, or when soil samples were not separated
by grass species.
5. Discussion
5.1. Plant community differences
Our hypothesis that species richness would differ
between forest types was supported, although it did
not follow the pattern that we expected. Brown (1994)
claimed that the richness of the aspen understory is an
important wildlife resource; therefore, we expected
that aspen forest would have the highest species
richness. We also expected an overall decrease in
species richness with elevation. Instead we found that
aspen forest had the lowest species richness and
species richness was low in the middle elevations
and high in ponderosa and bristlecone pine forest,
the highest and lowest elevation forests. The low
canopy cover in bristlecone and ponderosa pine forest
may explain the high species richness, as species
richness was negatively correlated with canopy cover.

current ponderosa pine forest plots were nearly unfor-
ested, with total tree basal areas less than 3 m2/ha. The
current high species richness in ponderosa pine forest
may be a relict from when these plots were less
forested. However, there have also been substantial
increases in the basal area of current aspen plots over
the past century (Cocke, 2004), but aspen plots had the
lowest species richness.
The pattern of high species richness in the low and
high elevation forest, with lower species richness in
the middle elevations was also reported by Allen et al.
(1991) in the southern Rocky Mountains. Although the
plot size in their study was similar to ours, their overall
species richness was between 5% and 65% larger than
what we found on the San Francisco Peaks. The
isolation of the high elevation forest on the Peaks
may explain the discrepancy. However, Allen et al.
(1991) also reported a positive correlation between
species richness and site moisture. Average yearly
precipitation in northern Arizona (56 cm) is similar
to that at their wettest site (Rocky Mountain National
Park, 53 cm). However, we sampled during 2000–
2003, when precipitation throughout the Southwest
averaged 5.1 cm/year below normal (Lawrimore,
2004). Allen et al. (1991) sampled during 1985–
1986, when precipitation was 5.8 and 8.0 cm above
normal, respectively (Lawrimore, 2004). The drought
may have resulted in low species richness in our study
area, as it has in other parts of the Southwest (Fule´
et al., 2002).
Although we found differences in species richness,
we did not ﬁnd differences in Shannon’s H0 diversity
index, which accounts for how evenly abundance is
distributed among species as well the number of
species present. The lack of difference in Shannon’s
H0 may indicate abundance was more evenly distrib-
uted among all species in the plots with low species
richness. Alternatively, methodological problems may
have obscured differences in diversity between forest
types. The point-line intercept method tends to under-
estimate species richness and overestimate cover,
compared to quadrat methods (Korb et al., 2003a).
As a consequence, any species diversity index calcu-
lated from point-line intercept data should be low. We
believe comparisons based on the point-line intercept
method are still valuable because Korb et al. (2003a)
showed that the error was fairly consistent over a wide
range of plant abundance. Therefore comparisons of
both species diversity and cover should still reﬂect
differences between forest types.
We conﬁrmed our hypothesis that plant abundance
differed between forest types and was highest in aspen
forest. Abundance of herbaceous plants could be
higher in aspen forest because aspen litter is more
nutritious than acidic, low-nitrogen conifer litter
(Fisher and Binkley, 2000). The extra light available
in the spring before aspen leaves emerge could also be
important to understory plants.
Species composition differed between forest types
with ecological links between indicator species and
historical patterns of disturbance regime and forest
structure. Our results agree with Naumburg and
DeWald (1999) who found species composition was
related to disturbance history.
Ponderosa pine forests are adapted to a ﬁre regime
of frequent low-intensity ﬁre, associated with histori-
cally open, grassy stands (Cooper, 1960; Swetnam and
Baisan, 2003). Astragalus rusbyi, Ceanothus fendleri,
Cirsium spp., Elymus elymoides, Lupinus spp., Muh-
lenbergia montana, and Verbascum thapsus, all indi-
cator species for ponderosa pine forest, are well-
adapted to surviving or recolonizing after ﬁre (Walsh,
1995; Simonin, 2001; Beier and Maschinski, 2003;
Hull-Sieg et al., 2003; Korb and Springer, 2003). Four
ponderosa pine indicators, Antennaria parviﬂora, Ely-
mus elymoides, Festuca arizonica and Muhlenbergia
montana, grow poorly in shaded conditions (Mat-
thews, 1993; Walsh, 1995; Naumburg and DeWald,
1999; Naumburg et al., 2001; Simonin, 2001). Pon-
derosa pine was also characterized by high diversity of
nitrogen ﬁxing species, although they were not neces-
sarily abundant. Six of the 14 ponderosa pine indicator
species were nitrogen ﬁxers (Astragalus humistratus,
A. rusbyi, Ceanothus fendleri, Lotus spp., Lupinus
spp., andOxytropis lambertii). Both NH4
+ and NO3

are lower in ponderosa pine forests than most other
forest types and may be more limiting than in other
forest types (Stark and Hart, 1997).
Despite ponderosa pine and mixed conifer forest
being adjacent to each other in elevation and similar in
historical ﬁre regime (Heinlein, 1996), there was little
overlap in species composition between the two forest
types (Fig. 2). Three of the four mixed conifer indi-
cator species are adapted to surviving either with or
without ﬁre. Holodiscus dumosus colonizes disturbed
and burned areas well, but is also considered indicative
M.A. Fisher, P.Z. Fule´ / Forest Ecology and Management 200 (2004) 293–311
304

of late seral communities (McMurray, 1987). Mahonia
repens can survive ﬁre and exists in both shade and full
sun, although in our study it was encountered more
frequently in more shaded areas (Walkup, 1991).
Pteridium aquilinum requires ﬁre for regeneration
by spores, but more often regenerates vegetatively
(Crane, 1990).
We found no indicator species for aspen forest.
However, there were correlations between Populus
tremuloides and abundance of nitrogen ﬁxing plants.
In particular, two legumes, Lathyrus lanszwertii var.
leucanthus and Lathryus or Vicia spp., were between 2
and 25 times more abundant on aspen plots than in
other forest types. However, both species were found
on 85% of all plots and one or both of them were
among the most common species encountered in all
ﬁve forest types (Table 1). We used the presence or
absence of species to determine indicator species, so a
species that is present in a variety of forest types, but
notably abundant in one, would not emerge in the
analysis.
Basal area in spruce/ﬁr forest is more than 20%
greater than any other forest type on the San Francisco
Peaks (Cocke, 2004). The two indicators for spruce/ﬁr
forest are both taxa commonly associated with moist,
shady areas. Neither indicator species disperses
widely, consistent with a stand-replacing ﬁre regime
in spruce/ﬁr. The widest variation in species composi-
tion occurred in spruce/ﬁr forest (Fig. 2). This may be
because of variation in species composition between
the dense stands of trees that characterize spruce/ﬁr
forest, and unforested openings where most herbac-
eous species are concentrated (Brown, 1994).
We were surprised by the number of shared char-
acteristics between bristlecone pine forest and pon-
derosa pine forest. Some bristlecone pine plots were
more similar to ponderosa pine plots than spruce/ﬁr
plots; even though mean elevation in spruce/ﬁr and
bristlecone pine forest differs by only 84 m (Fig. 2).
Bristlecone and ponderosa pine forests were high in
species richness and low in canopy cover. Mean
species richness in these two forest types was 30.9
 0.9, compared to 25.0  0.8 in all other forest types.
Canopy cover for bristlecone and ponderosa pine
forest was 45.9  2.9%, but 66.3  1.9% in all other
forest types. They were also the only forest types that
had grasses as indicator species. Germination of one
bristlecone pine indicator, Ribes montigenum, is
thought to be enhanced by low-intensity ﬁre (Mar-
shall, 1995). Bristlecone pine forest differed from
ponderosa pine forest in having a high density of
shrubs and low richness of N-ﬁxing species. Soil cover
was seven times greater in bristlecone pine forest than
in any other forest type. One bristlecone pine indica-
tor, Penstemon whippleanus, was associated with a
high occurrence of bare soil.
Bristlecone pine indicator species on the San Fran-
cisco Peaks were similar to species associated with
Pinus aristata in the Rocky Mountains. Both Penste-
mon whippleanusand Festuca ovina were common in
one of the six bristlecone pine associations identiﬁed
by Ranne et al. (1997) and Ribes montigenum was
common in two. In addition, both studies found spe-
cies of Erigeron and Mertensia were indicative of
bristlecone pine forest.
The mycorrhizal dependencies of the great major-
ity of the species encountered in this study have been
poorly documented, so we made no attempt to create a
list of mycorrhizal/non-mycorrhizal status. However,
at least two of the most common taxa (Table 1: Carex
spp. and Lupinus spp.) and several indicator species
(Table 2: Lupinus spp., Verbascum thapsus, Pyrola
spp.) are widely considered non-mycorrhizal.
5.2. Exotics and susceptibility to invasion
The most invaded communities were the ones with
the highest native species richness and abundance,
contradicting our hypothesis. This was supported by
univariate correlations, multivariate ordinations and
correlations between indicator species for plots with
exotic species with native species richness and abun-
dance (Table 4). Theory, supported by greenhouse
experiments, predicts that high biodiversity areas
should more completely use available resources, mak-
ing them more resistant to invasion by new species
(Naeem et al., 2000). However, observational studies
often show greater richness or abundance of exotic
species in areas with higher native species richness
(Stohlgren et al., 1999, 2001). Site characteristics,
such as water availability and soil fertility, usually
vary in observational studies but are held constant in
experiments and may account for the discrepancy
(Naeem et al., 2000).
Our hypothesis of lower exotic species richness in
higher elevations was conﬁrmed although exotic spe-
M.A. Fisher, P.Z. Fule´ / Forest Ecology and Management 200 (2004) 293–311
305

cies abundance did not vary with elevation. This
suggests exotic species do not face barriers to growth,
but may face barriers to dispersal. Roads, camp-
grounds, and livestock grazing can facilitate invasion
by providing a dispersal vector into an area (Knapp,
1996; Allen and Hansen, 1999). However, since the
exotic species most frequently encountered in high
elevations, Taraxacum ofﬁcinale, has wind dispersed
seeds, disturbance should minimally inﬂuence its
spread.
Alternatively, high-elevation forests on the San
Francisco Peaks may have experienced relatively little
invasion because seed sources for exotic species well-
adapted to boreal forest are not available due to the
rarity of this forest type in the Southwest. Stohlgren et
al. (2000) hypothesized low temperatures limited
exotic species in the higher elevations of Rocky
Mountain National Park. Even though successful
invaders often have wide ecological tolerances or
can adapt quickly to new conditions (Bazzaz, 1986;
Parker et al., 2003), generalist species have ecological
limits. Species such as Bromus tectorum, Linaria
dalmatica, and Verbascum thapsus that are known
invaders of lower elevation ecosystems may have
encountered ecological limitations above ponderosa
pine forest (Knapp, 1996; Jacobs and Sheley, 2003;
Parker et al., 2003).
Exotic species do not yet appear to be a major
portion of the plant community on the San Francisco
Peaks. On average, exotic species accounted for only
3.5  3.8% of the total species richness per plot and
0.5  1.2% of the total plant abundance per plot.
Exotic species never composed more than 14.3% of
the species richness and 6.0% of the abundance. No
exotic species were found on 40% of plots and exotic
species were not abundant enough to be detected on
the point-line transect of an additional 37%. However,
plant species composition on plots with exotic species
differed from those which had none. Unfortunately,
our study design does not allow us to distinguish
whether exotic species change the plant community
as whole or whether some plant communities are more
easily invaded than others.
It is important to identify which exotic species may
pose future threats to native vegetation (Parker et al.,
1999). We believe Linaria dalmatica has the most
invasive potential because it is already known to be
noxious in this area, responds positively to ﬁre, and
seeds are still viable after relatively long-term storage
(Jacobs and Sheley, 2003; Zouhar, 2003b). Verbascum
thapsus is a noxious weed in Arizona, frequently
encountered in burned areas (Crawford et al., 2001),
but it declines in the absence of recurring soil dis-
turbance (Hull-Sieg et al., 2003). Taraxacum ofﬁcinale
has been assumed to be a poor competitor with later
seral plants (Esser, 1993). However, our results agree
with others who found T. ofﬁcinale is able to invade
previously undisturbed areas (Weaver et al., 1990).
Although Bromus inermis, Poa compressa and P.
pratensis are not listed as noxious weeds in Arizona,
exotic grasses, such as P. pratensis, can be the most
commonly encountered exotic species (Weaver et al.,
1990, 2001; Hull-Sieg et al., 2003). In particular, P.
pratensis was the second most widely distributed
exotic species in our study. Bromus tectorum has
altered many areas of sagebrush steppe so it can no
longer support native plant communities (Knapp,
1996; Zouhar, 2003a). B. tectorum does not grow well
under low-light conditions or under a large organic
layer, making it a less severe a threat to forest vegeta-
tion (Pierson and Mack, 1990; Pierson et al., 1990).
However, it is well-adapted to ﬁre and other distur-
bances (Knapp, 1996; Zouhar, 2003a).
5.3. Arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization
Levels of AM inoculum potential that we found are
consistent with other studies with corn bioassays in
coniferous forest, though this may be a coarse com-
parison because of differences in AM species compo-
sition and methodologies. Gildar et al. (2004) and
Korb et al. (2003b) reported AM inoculum potential in
ponderosa pine forest varied between 6–24% and 18–
45%, respectively, depending on the ﬁre history and
tree density. Although AM inoculum potential has
been assumed low in forests where trees do not
associate with AM fungi (Newman and Reddell,
1988), our corn bioassay results report inoculum
potentials comparable to those found in other ecosys-
tems. For example, Johnson et al. (1991) recorded AM
inoculum potential in a prairie varied between 1% and
20%, while Gehring et al. (2002) reported AM inocu-
lum potential of between 12% and 19% in a tropical
rainforest.
Our hypothesis of negative correlation between
AM colonization and basal area was supported, agree-
M.A. Fisher, P.Z. Fule´ / Forest Ecology and Management 200 (2004) 293–311
306

ing with ﬁndings of researchers in other forest types
(Benjamin et al., 1989; Johnson et al., 1991). Benja-
min et al. (1989) hypothesized AM colonization was
low under forest canopy due to inhibition from the
ectomycorrhizal fungi colonizing tree roots. Newman
and Reddell (1988) used a similar explanation to
account for a positive correlation between herbaceous
species richness and the abundance of trees capable of
associating with AM fungi. If this were true, we would
expect AM colonization to be highest in aspen-domi-
nated plots because aspen can form associations with
both AM and ectomycorrhizae, while most coniferous
trees can only form associations with ectomycorrhizae
(Trappe, 1962; Mosse et al., 1981; Neville et al.,
2002). Our results did not support this theory because
AM colonization was no higher in aspen forest than in
any other forest type.
Our results showing that plots with high AM
colonization also tended to have high species richness
agree with a number of other researchers’ ﬁndings,
though some previous studies compared mycorrhizal
presence/absence rather than mycorrhizal abundance
(Grime et al., 1987; Newman and Reddell, 1988;
Moora and Zobel, 1996). However, there were no
correlations between AM inoculum and exotic species
richness or abundance. In some cases AM fungi may
encourage the establishment of native over exotic
species (Reeves et al., 1979; Korb, 2001). However,
this may vary depending on the speciﬁc exotic species
in question, the native species with which it interacts,
and the mycorrhizal dependency of both species
(Knapp, 1996; Marler et al., 1999).
Changes in AM fungi across landscape gradients
are a fertile area of study (Reynolds et al., 2003), but
we suspect AM colonization levels are affected by
microsite
differences
that
were
not
adequately
addressed in a study of this scale. Percent AM colo-
nization varied with the plant the soil was taken under,
consistent with the host species effect noted by Eom et
al. (2000). Canopy cover, tree basal area, soil nutri-
ents, soil moisture, and ecotypes within species also
affect the AM community (Anderson et al., 1984,
1994; Benjamin et al., 1989; Johnson et al., 1991;
Schultz et al., 2001). Changes in elevation are neces-
sarily tied with changes in soil moisture, temperature,
slope, tree stand structure, vegetation and soil nutri-
ents (Austin, 1999). Important differences in AM
inoculum potential may have been lost in these inter-
acting variables. For example, we only found an
increase in AM colonization with elevation when
we exclusively compared samples collected under
Muhlenbergia montana. Future studies comparing
AM fungi across landscape level gradients would also
be improved by examining AM species composition
(van der Heijden et al., 1998a; Klironomos, 2003).
5.4. Community change
Communities are stable over a range of environ-
mental conditions, but can rapidly change toward a new
steady state if threshold conditions are exceeded (Gosz,
1992). Ecosystem stability is increased by the presence
of many functional groups (Naeem et al., 1999). The
richness of the functional groups that we identiﬁed did
not vary across forest types. Having several species
within a functional group can be important for the
resilience of that community as environmental condi-
tions change (Walker, 1995; Naeem, 1998; Walker et
al., 1999). N-ﬁxing plants in ponderosa pine forest are
species rich, which could help preserve the functioning
of the community as climate changes. Only two legu-
minous taxa, Lathyrus lanszwertii var. leucanthus and
Lathryus or Vicia spp., were found in all other forest
types on the San Francisco Peaks. Since these two
species are common in all forest types, they appear
to have broad ecological tolerances (Table 1). If these
species encounter problems migrating under changing
climate, however, the missing functional group could
result in ecosystem failure (Naeem, 1998).
Perry et al. (1990) suggested low abundance of AM
fungi in coniferous forests could hinder migration of
plants that associate chieﬂy with AM fungi. Our
research showed AM inoculum is present in forests
and should be available to facilitate species migra-
tions. However, changes associated with climate
change such as elevated CO2, increasing temperatures,
and decreased water availability may affect the colo-
nization abilities of AM fungi (Monz et al., 1994).
The indicator species that we identiﬁed may be
valuable in monitoring changes throughout the San
Francisco Peaks. Five indicator species were found in
many forest types, but most reliably in one forest type,
making them faithful but not exclusive indicators.
They were Elymus elymoides, Festuca arizonica,
Lupinus spp., and Muhlenbergia montana from pon-
derosa pine forest and Pteridium aquilinum from
M.A. Fisher, P.Z. Fule´ / Forest Ecology and Management 200 (2004) 293–311

mixed conifer forest. Species, such as these, whose
habitat extends into ecotones might be better able to
migrate under changing climatic conditions (Stohlg-
ren et al., 2000). The remaining indicator species are
more limited to the forest type in which they are
indicators, but are not reliably found on every example
of that forest type. Since this later group of indicator
species are restricted to one forest type, they could be
useful in monitoring the health of speciﬁc Arizona
forest types (Carignan and Villard, 2002). Several
non-indicator species were common in multiple forest
types and could be predisposed to being successful
migrants (Malcolm et al., 2002). Arenaria lanuginosa
ssp. saxosa, Lathyrus lanszwertii var. leucanthus, Poa
fendleriana, Pseudocymopterus montanus, and Sene-
cio eremophilus were found in all ﬁve forest types and
were found on more than 20 belts in three or more
forest types. Frasera speciosa, Maianthemum stella-
tum, and Penstemon barbatus were found in all ﬁve
forest types and were found on more than 10 belts in
two or more forest types.
