Abstract
Background: Accelerated vegetation changes are predicted for Southwestern forests due to changing disturbance
regimes and climate. The 2001 Leroux Fire burned across a landscape with pre-existing permanent plots during one
of the most extreme drought periods over the last few decades, providing a rare opportunity to assess wildfire
−drought interactions. The wildfire burned with variable severity across a mountainous transition zone. We took
advantage of this opportunity to re-measure plots originally established in 2000, and extend the temporal scale of
response data to 15 years post-fire.
Results: Although fire severity classification adequately described initial effects, tree mortality was indistinguishable
among the burned plots between 2002 and 2016, ranging from 38 to 41%. Our results indicated extensive
secondary tree mortality that nearly equaled initial mortality in three of four fire severity classes. Mortality from
2002 to 2016 varied by species, with quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) experiencing disproportionately
higher mortality (46 to 62% tree loss) than other species across all fire severities. Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa
Engelm.) mortality (34% tree loss) between 2002 and 2016 on unburned plots, along with similar mortality on
moderate- and high-severity plots, show that even the most drought-tolerant species on our site was affected by
exceptionally warm and dry conditions. Regeneration immediately post fire was dominated by aspen sprouts
across all fire severities. By 2016, however, aspen densities were lower than pre-fire observations in unburned,
moderate- and high-severity plots, and conifer seedlings primarily established in unburned plots. Ponderosa pine
seedlings established between 2011 and 2016 and were observed in only one unburned plot in 2016. The lack of
pine regeneration and the relatively small size of high-severity patches in the Leroux Fire suggest that factors
other than seed dispersal limited ponderosa pine regeneration.
Conclusions: Substantial mortality (68% tree loss) and 39% basal area reduction over the 15-year study, plus variable
aspen regeneration and sparse conifer regeneration, led to non-forested conditions and isolated aspen stands.
Although small in size, the Leroux Fire provided an example of continuing post-fire forest community changes driven
by temperature increases and drought. Thus, wildfire and climate change interactions may accelerate shifts in structure
and composition in Southwest forest ecosystems.

Resumen
Antecedentes: Cambios acelerados en la vegetación se pronostican para los bosques del sudoeste de los EEUU
debido a modificaciones en los regímenes de disturbios y en el clima. El Incendio de Leroux de 2001 quemó
durante uno de los períodos de sequía más extremos en las últimas décadas, un paisaje con parcelas permanente
preexistentes, lo que proporcionó una rara oportunidad para determinar las interacciones entre incendios y sequía.
El incendio quemó con severidad variable a través de una zona montañosa de transición. Sacamos provecho de
esta oportunidad para remedir las parcelas originalmente establecidas en 2000 y extendimos la escala temporal de
datos-respuesta 15 años post-incendio.
Resultados: Aunque la clasificación de la severidad del fuego describió adecuadamente sus efectos iniciales, la
mortalidad de los árboles fue indistinguible entre las parcelas quemadas entre 2002 y 2016, cuyo rango fue del 38
al 41%. Nuestros resultados indicaron una mortalidad secundaria más extendida que casi igualó la mortalidad inicial
en tres de las cuatro clases de severidad. La mortalidad desde 2002 a 2016 varió entre especies, con el álamo
temblón (Populus tremuloides Michx.) mostrando una mortalidad desproporcionada (46 a 62% de árboles muertos)
comparada con otras especies y a través de todas las severidades. La mortalidad del pino ponderosa (Pinus
ponderosa Engelm.) (34% de árboles muertos) entre 2002 y 2016 en parcelas no quemadas, junto con similar
mortalidad en parcelas con severidad moderada a alta, mostraron que aún las especies más tolerantes a la sequía
en nuestro sitio de estudio fueron afectadas por excepcionales condiciones de calor y sequía. La regeneración
inmediata post-fuego fue dominada por rebrotes de álamo temblón a través de todas las severidades de fuego.
Para 2016, sin embargo, las densidades del álamo temblón fueron menores en las parcelas no quemadas, y en las
quemadas a severidades moderadas a altas, que en las observadas previo al fuego, y también que las plántulas de
coníferas se establecían primariamente en parcelas no quemadas. Las plántulas de pino ponderosa se establecieron
entre 2011 y 2016 y fueron observadas solo en una parcela no quemada en 2016. La falta de regeneración de pino
y el tamaño relativamente pequeño de los parches de alta severidad en el incendio de Leroux sugieren que otros
factores aparte de la dispersión de semillas limitaron la regeneración del pino ponderosa.
Conclusiones: Una mortalidad substancial (68% de pérdida de árboles) y reducción del 39% del área basal en los
15 años de estudio, más una regeneración variable de álamo temblón y laxa de coníferas, llevaron a condiciones de
no recuperación del dosel forestal y al establecimiento de rodales aislados de álamo temblón. Aunque pequeño en
tamaño, el incendio de Leroux proveyó de un ejemplo de cambios continuos en la comunidad vegetal post fuego
derivado del incremento de temperaturas y sequía. De esta manera, las interacciones entre el cambio climático y
los incendios pueden acelerar los cambios en estructura y composición de los ecosistemas forestales del Sudoeste
de EEUU.
Background
Wildfire and climate interact to play complex roles in de-
termining tree mortality, species establishment, and forest
composition. As climatic patterns trend towards warmer
and drier conditions, and the occurrence and size of forest
wildfires increase across the southwestern US (Westerling
et al. 2006; Dennison et al. 2014; Hurteau et al. 2014), ac-
celerated vegetation changes are predicted for many for-
ested ecosystems (Allen et al. 2015). Under high CO2
emission scenarios, models suggest widespread tree mor-
tality and forest loss in the Southwest (Diggins et al. 2010,
Tarancón et al. 2014, Stoddard et al. 2015). Other models
suggest the need for migration of tree species to track
suitable climatic conditions (Laughlin et al. 2011). In-
creased temperature and drought stress in the early
twenty-first century have shown to contribute to de-
creased conifer regeneration (Stevens-Rumann et al.
2018). Although climate change may be the primary factor
driving
ecological
responses,
disturbances
such
as
wildfires are likely to interact with climate in complex
ways, with uncertain effects on forest structure and com-
position (Donato et al. 2016). Shifts in forest composition
and tree species distributions in response to wildfire and
climate are likely to be most readily observed in transition
zones, where species are near their environmental limits
(Adams and Kolb 2004; Mast and Wolf 2004). Monitoring
indicators of change, such as tree mortality and regener-
ation at these transition zones, can provide greater
insights concerning processes that influence both shifts in
composition as well as persistence of key species.
On topographically diverse landscapes in the south-
western US, aspect and steep vertical gradients delineate
ecological zones, often over short horizontal distances
(Merriam
1890;
Whittaker
and
Niering
1975).
In
addition, composition and vegetation dynamics are de-
termined through disturbance−microclimate interactions
(Grissino-Mayer et al. 1995, Stephens 2001, Beaty and
Taylor 2008, Iniguez et al. 2009, Rodman et al. 2016).

For example, stand structure and composition of dry
mixed-conifer forests were historically regulated by fre-
quent, low-severity fire intermixed with high-severity
patches (Swetnam and Baisan 1996; Fulé et al. 2003;
Margolis and Balmat 2009; Huffman et al. 2015). Inter-
ruption of natural fire cycles through intensive land use
since the late 1800s is responsible for substantial alter-
ations in structure and function of these ecosystems
(Covington and Moore 1994; Allen et al. 2002; Seager et
al. 2007). As a result of fire exclusion, dry mixed-conifer
and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Engelm.) forests
have become spatially homogenized with smaller, youn-
ger trees and have shifted in dominance towards more
shade- and fire-intolerant species (Huffman et al. 2015;
Strahan et al. 2016). Thus, prior to intensive anthropo-
genic changes, frequent surface fire acted to edit (i.e., fil-
ter)
species
assemblages,
and
supersede
climatic
influences.
Often, fire severity is used to predict successional tra-
jectories and rates of ecosystem recovery (Lentile et al.
2007), though these processes are influenced by life his-
tory traits of species in the community (Turner et al.
1998; Westoby et al. 2002). For example, ponderosa
pine, one of the most fire-resistant and drought-tolerant
species in Western forests, has thick bark and protective
buds that can often tolerate moderate fire intensity
(Vines 1968; Reynolds et al. 2013). In mixed communi-
ties, ponderosa pine would be expected to better resist
moderate-severity fire and fill space left by mortality of
less tolerant species. In contrast, quaking aspen (Populus
tremuloides Michx.) is susceptible to top-kill from
low-intensity fires due to its thin bark, but this species
often resprouts vigorously (Brown and DeByle 1987).
After high-severity fire, aspen would be expected to rap-
idly recolonize a site through vegetative reproduction.
Given warming climate and drier conditions, post-fire
recovery trajectories, even for fire-resistant and resilient
species, are subject to change. To better understand com-
plex post-fire successional responses in mixed-species for-
ests, long-term monitoring is necessary.
Cocke et al. (2005a) classified four fire severities (un-
burned, low, moderate, and high) using the differenced
normalized burn ratio (ΔNBR) for pre- and post-fire re-
mote imagery (Key and Benson 2006) one year following
the Leroux wildfire that occurred in 2001 on the San
Francisco Peaks in northern Arizona, USA. They also
took advantage of pre-fire measurements and 1-year
post-fire measurements on permanent plots to compare
first order fire effects within severity types as classified
by
ΔNBR.
Cocke
et
al.
(2005a)
concluded
that
satellite-based severity classifications were strongly asso-
ciated with ground-based fire severity assessments from
permanent plots. In this study, we remeasured the plots
described
by
Cocke
et
al.
(2005a)
to
extend
our
understanding of responses to 15 years post fire. In
addition, from 1996 to 2016, the Southwest region expe-
rienced a period of severe drought (Weiss et al. 2009;
Garfin et al. 2013), and this provided a unique opportun-
ity to analyze effects of drought on mutli-year responses
to wildfire. We asked the following research questions:
(i) What are the prolonged effects of a wildfire on over-
story structure and tree mortality? (ii) Is long-term tree
mortality related to initial fire severity? and (iii) What
are the effects of fire severity on tree regeneration over
time? The intent of this study was to quantify changes in
forest structure through time within the extent of the
Leroux Fire, and to compare tree mortality and regener-
ation within fire severity classes.
Methods
Study area
Our study area was the site of the Leroux Fire, lo-
cated within the Kachina Peaks Wilderness Area, on
the
Coconino
National
Forest,
north
of
Flagstaff,
Arizona, USA (35°18' N, 111°41' W). The Leroux Fire
was a human-ignited wildfire that started on 11 June
2001 and burned ~500 ha on the south-facing slope
of Agassiz Peak, between 2490 and 3145 m (details
described in Cocke et al. 2005b. The fire burned pri-
marily in a ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forest
ecotone. Tree species included ponderosa pine, quak-
ing aspen (hereafter “aspen”), Douglas-fir (Pseudot-
suga
menziesii
[Mirb.]
Franco),
and
limber
pine
(Pinus flexilis James). In order of tolerance to drought
and fire, ponderosa pine > Douglas-fir > limber pine >
aspen (Reynolds et al. 2013; Rodman et al. 2016).
Limber pine and Douglas-fir are considered inter-
mediate with regards to shade tolerance, while pon-
derosa pine and aspen have a low shade tolerance.
Ponderosa pine seedlings can take 4 to 19 years to
grow to 40 cm (Puhlick et al. 2013), while Douglas-fir
and limber pine grow slower, taking 14 to 25 years to
grow to 40 cm (Heinlein et al. 2005). Aspen is the
only root-sprouting species of the four tree species.
Perennial
native
bunch
grasses
(Festuca
arizonica
Vasey, Muhlenbergia montana Nutt., Poa fendleriana
Steud., and Elymus elymoides [Raf.] Swezey) were
dominant in the pre-fire forest understory (Fisher and
Fulé 2004).
Data collection
In 2002, Cocke et al. (2005a) remeasured 18 burned
plots and 6 unburned plots that were established prior
to the Leroux Fire. Plots were 0.1 ha (20 m × 50 m) in
size and spaced on a systematic rectangular grid 300 m
north to south, and 300 to 600 m east to west. All trees
were tagged and tree measurements included species,
condition, diameter at breast height (dbh; 1.37 m above

ground), total height, and crown base height. Trees
≥15 cm dbh were measured on the entire plots; trees be-
tween 2.5 and 15 cm dbh were measured on a 0.025 ha
subplot. Seedlings and ramets <2.5 cm dbh and >15 cm
tall were considered regeneration and tallied by species
on a 50 m2 subplot (NPS 2003). Seedlings and ramets
<15 cm tall were consider germinates, not established
regeneration, and excluded from analysis. Cocke et al.
(2005a) created a burn severity map for the extent of the
Leroux Fire from Landsat 7 imagery by calculating the
change in the normalized burn ratio (ΔNBR) of bands 4
and 7 from pre-fire (2000) and post-fire (2002) imagery
(Key and Benson 2006). These burn severity classifica-
tions were then verified with composite burn index
(CBI) ground-truthing plots (Key and Benson 2006). The
burn severity classifications indicated 12% of the total
area within the fire perimeter was unburned, 52% was
low severity, 29% was moderate burn severity, and 7%
was high burn severity (Fig. 1). The resulting severity
map was then used to classify the 24 permanent plots by
severity levels. Six plots were classified as low burn
severity and six as unburned, eight classified as moderate
urn severity and four as high burn severity. We remea-
sured the same 24 plots in 2011 and 2016.
Analysis
Means for tree density and basal area (BA) for describing
conditions for the entire Leroux Fire (whole-fire level)
were estimated using area-weighted means (ATW) by
fire severity class proportions and relative sampling
intensity. Weighting severity class means by their rela-
tive proportion of total fire area provides a more accur-
ate
estimate
of whole-fire
conditions
compared to
assuming that plots represent the variability in fire sever-
ity when randomly sampled. To test for differences in
live overstory tree density and basal area (BA) between
sample years, we used one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Tree density was transformed (square root)
in
order
to
meet
normality
and
homoscedasticity
assumptions of ANOVA. When significant main effects
were
found,
Tukey’s

significant
difference
(HSD) post hoc multiple comparisons test was used to

test for pairwise differences between sample years. Dif-
ferences in overstory species composition between
pre-fire and 2016 (post fire) were analyzed using per-
mutational multivariate analysis (PERMANOVA) with
Bray-Curtis dissimilarity distance measure (Anderson
2001; Faith et al. 1987). Differences in overstory com-
position
were
tested
using

importance
values calculated by summing relative tree density
and relative basal area for each tree species. This
index provides a measure of relative dominance of a
given species in a community (Strahan et al. 2016).
Because plots were not independent in treatment (Leroux
Fire) and measurement year, inferences drawn from our
analyses are limited to this individual fire event.
To test for differences in tree mortality (i.e., tree
density loss) between severity classes and post-fire
years, we used Chi-square tests (2 × 2 contingency ta-
bles). We calculated average percent tree mortality by
tree density (tree ha−1) for each species and for all
species
combined
by
fire
severity
classes
and
by
post-fire year. We tested for differences in relative
mortality among fire severities for each species and
for all species combined within measurement years.
We also compared initial mortality (2000 to 2002) to
cumulative secondary mortality (2002 to 2016) within
each severity class for each species and all species
combined. For each pairwise comparison, we used a
Bonferroni correction to account for multiple con-
trasts. For 2016 observations, percentage of plots with
regeneration was calculated by fire severity class and
compared using Chi-square tests (2 × 2 contingency
table). Total regeneration was compared between fire
severity classes within each measurement year with a
non-parametric
Kruskal-Wallis
test
due
to
non-normal data distributions. All analyses were con-
ducted using α = 0.05.
Results
Whole-fire overstory changes
Compared with pre-fire (2000) conditions, live overstory
density and BA were significantly reduced by the Leroux
Fire (P < 0.001 for both tree density and BA measured in
2002) and continued to decline through year 2011
(Fig. 2). Before the fire, area-weighted mean (AWM) tree
density was 686.2 trees ha−1 and area-weighted mean
BA was 38.2 m2 ha−1 (Fig. 2). Pre-fire tree diameter dis-
tribution followed a reverse-J distribution with relatively
high numbers of small trees (Fig. 3). In 2002, AWM tree
density was 344.2 trees ha−1, a decline of 50% from
pre-fire tree densities. Average BA declined by 27% from
pre-fire levels and AWM was 27.8 m2 ha−1 in 2002. Ini-
tial post-fire mortality (2000 to 2002) occurred primarily
(71% of total mortality) in the smallest diameter class
(Fig. 3). Initial tree loss for each species ranged between
40 and 64% (Fig. 3). Live tree density and BA declined
by 34% (118 trees ha−1) and 19% (5.4 m2 ha−1), respect-
ively, from 2002 to 2011. Mortality from 2002 to 2011,
subsequent to the initial post-fire response, ranged from
19 to 42% across all diameter classes (Fig. 3). Aspen tree
mortality from 2002 to 2011 was disproportionate (52%)
compared to conifer species in the fire (<39%). Average
tree density continued to decrease such that, by 2016,
density
had
decreased
68%
to
an
average
of
218.5 trees ha−1. Average BA slightly decreased (19%)
from 2002 to 2011. By 2016, BA averaged 23.2 m2 ha−1,
which was 39% below pre-fire BA. In 2016, diameter
distributions were unimodal, with a slight peak in the
<20 cm diameter class.
Prior to the fire, ponderosa pine made up 60% of total
tree density (excluding regeneration) and 62% of the BA,
on average. Aspen made up 18% and 14%, limber pine
made up 12% and 10%, and Douglas-fir was 10% and
5%,
respectively,
of
pre-fire
tree
density
and
BA.

Overstory species composition (based on species import-
ance values) in 2016 was similar (PERMANOVA P = 0.
20) to pre-fire composition. In 2016, ponderosa pine
composed 66% of live post-fire trees and 67% of BA.
Aspen made up 15% of tree density and 19% of BA; lim-
ber pine accounted for 12% and 11% of tree density and
BA, respectively; and Douglas-fir made up 7% of tree
density and 7% of BA.
Fire severity effects on overstory
Compared with pre-fire (2000) conditions, live tree dens-
ities were significantly (P < 0.05) lower in all burn severity
classes in 2016 (Fig. 4). Initial tree mortality (i.e., tree
density decreases) from 2000 to 2002 was significantly
higher in moderate-severity plots compared to unburned,
low-, and high-severity plots (χ2 = 120 to 424, P < 0.0125;
Table 1). On average, tree densities declined 12% (79
trees ha−1), 39% (216 trees ha−1), 69% (572 trees ha−1), and
44% (612 trees ha−1) in unburned, low-, moderate-, and
high-severity plots, respectively. Tree mortality (2000 to
2002) of all species generally was greater in moderate- and
high-severity
plots
compared
to
unburned
and
low-severity plots (Table 1). Secondary tree mortality
(both 2002 to 2011 and 2002 to 2016) was not statistically
different among low-, moderate- and high-severity plots
(Table 1), but mortality in all three burned classes was sig-
nificantly higher than that of unburned plots (χ2 = 12 to
19, P < 0.0125). Tree mortality from 2002 to 2016 was
most pronounced on high- (40% or 319 trees ha−1) and
low-severity (40% or 134 trees ha−1) plots, followed by
those classified as moderate-sevrity (30% or 78 trees ha−1)
and unburned plots (18% or 107 trees ha−1). One

high-severity plot and three moderate-severity plots had
no live overstory trees remaining in 2016. Tree mortality
from 2002 to 2016 varied by species, with aspens experi-
encing disproportionately high mortality (46 to 62% tree
loss) across all fire severities. Mortality from 2002 to 2016
for all species except aspen generally followed the same
patterns as all species combined, with no differences
among the different burned severity classes but signifi-
cantly greater than unburned plots (Table 1). By 2016, tree
densities averaged 477.1 trees ha−1, 210.4 trees ha−1,
179.2 trees ha −1, and 469.8 trees ha−1, in unburned, low-,
moderate- and high-severity plots, respectively. Changes
in BA followed the same pattern as tree densities. How-
ever, BA in 2016 was significantly (P < 0.05) less than
pre-fire conditions only on moderate- and high-severity
plots (Fig. 4). On average, BA declined 15%, 29%, 62%,
and 47% on plots classified as unburned, low, moderate
and high severity, respectively. By 2016, BA averaged
26.3
m2
ha−1,
24.9
m2
ha−1,
15.3
m2
ha−1,
and
27.6
m2
ha−1,
in
unburned,
low-,
moderate-,
and
high-severity plots, respectively.
Significantly more tree mortality (i.e., tree density de-
creases) occurred initially (2000 to 2002) following the
Leroux Fire in moderate-severity plots than from 2002 to
2016 (χ2 = 61.3, P < 0.025), whereas mortality from 2002 to
2016 in unburned plots was significantly higher than initial
(2000 to 2002) fire mortality (χ2 = 31.3, P < 0.025). Initial
fire mortality and mortality from 2002 to 2016 was not
significantly different within low- and high-severity plots.
Differences between initial and subsequent secondary mor-
tality by individual species were variable within each burn
severity (Table 1).
Fire severity effects on tree regeneration
Total regeneration did not differ significantly within
sampling years among fire severity classes in the Leroux
Fire (Fig. 5). Pre-fire (2000) regeneration species com-
position within the entire fire was 47% aspen, 29%
ponderosa pine, 12% limber pine, and 12% Douglas-fir.
At this time, tree regeneration was observed on 50% of
the plots. One year after the fire (2002), aspen densities
increased
335%
(+688
stems
ha−1),
280%
(+1053 stems ha−1), 1781% (+3206 stems ha−1), and
600% (+303 stems ha−1) in unburned, low-, moderate-,
and high-severity plots, respectively. Between 2002 and
2011, aspen densities within all severity classes declined
36 to 204 stems ha−1 below pre-fire densities (Fig. 5). No
aspen regeneration was found in high-severity plots in
2011 or 2016. In 2016, aspen densities were 50% and
14% less than pre-fire values, in unburned and moderate
severity
plots,
respectively,
but
increased
475%
(+1782 stems ha−1) in low-severity plots and exceeded
initial post-fire numbers by 51%. Prior to the fire, pon-
derosa pine densities averaged 0 seedlings ha−1, 0 seed-
lings ha−1, 129 seedlings ha−1, and 354 seedlings ha−1 in
unburned, low-, moderate-, and high-severity plots,

respectively. One year after the fire, no ponderosa pine
seedlings
were
found
within
low-,
moderate-,
or
high-severity plots and remained absent 15 years after
the fire in both low- and high-severity plots (Fig. 5). In
2016, ponderosa pine seedlings were found on one (13%)
moderate-severity plot with a density of 406 seed-
lings ha−1 and three unburned plots (50%) with densities
ranging from 204 to 1851 seedlings ha−1. One year after
the fire, Douglas-fir seedlings were not found on burned
plots,
and
remained
absent
in
moderate-
and
high-severity plots in 2016. In 2016, Douglas-fir seed-
lings equaled densities (34 seedlings ha−1) found pre fire
in low-severity plots and increased 150% in unburned
plots compared to pre-fire densities (203 seedling ha−1).
Prior to the Leroux Fire, limber pine was found on
low-severity
(averaged
101
seedlings
ha−1)
and
moderate-severity (averaged 51 seedlings ha−1) plots. No
limber pine seedlings were observed on any post-fire
plots, including unburned plots.
By 2016, regeneration species composition within the
Leroux Fire was 85% aspen, 14% ponderosa pine, and 1%
Douglas-fir. In 2016, the percentage of plots occupied by
regeneration was not significantly different among fire
severity classes. Regeneration was observed on 37.5% of
the plots and tended to occur more commonly on un-
burned plots.
Discussion
The 2001 Leroux Fire burned mainly as low (52%) to
moderate severity (29%). This resulted in substantial
differences in post-fire tree density and basal area,
but did not significantly affect overstory species com-
position within this ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer
ecotone. Tree density and BA continued to decrease
over time and mortality remained nearly constant
over
15
years
within
low-,
moderate-,
and
high-severity classes. Thus, initial fire severity was not
strongly related to longer-term patterns of mortality.
Although regeneration was highly variable across fire
severity
classes
and
through
time,
quaking
aspen
sprouts accounted for 85% of the tree seedlings and
ramets
observed. Overstory
changes
were
concen-
trated in smaller tree size classes (≤20 cm dbh) and,
compared with pre-fire, resulting structure in low-
and moderate-severity areas more closely resembled
historical (i.e., pre 1900) conditions (Cocke et al.
2005b). Taken together, these results suggest that fire,
subsequent climatic conditions, and likely other sec-
ondary factors interacted to reduce tree density and
limit establishment of conifers. The successional tra-
jectory of the Leroux Fire is unclear, particularly as
climate warms and drought periods become more
severe or common (Laughlin et al. 2011). It is likely
that ponderosa pine will persist in the overstory over
the next few decades, and large, seed-bearing trees
may provide a seed source for regeneration under
favorable
environmental
conditions
in
the
future.
However, continued lack of conifer regeneration, such
as we observed in this 15-year study, may, with time,
lead to novel ecological conditions.

Severity patterns
Although fire severity classification reportedly described
the variability in first-order fire effects at this site (see
Cocke et al. 2005a), secondary tree mortality was indis-
tinguishable among the burned (low, moderate, high) se-
verity classes from 2002 to 2016, and ranged from 38 to
42% for all species combined. In low-severity plots, sec-
ondary tree mortality ranged from 26 to 62%, which may
be high compared with patterns of secondary mortality
reported for low-severity wildfire areas in western US
dry forests elsewhere (Keyser et al. 2008; Fornwalt et al.
2018). In addition, tree mortality on unburned plots
from 2002 to 2016 was 26%, double the initial mortality
(2000 to 2002) one year following the Leroux Fire
(Fig. 4). These results point to climate-related factors
leading to considerable tree mortality and limited conifer
regeneration over the study period. Secondary mortality
within the Leroux Fire was likely driven, at least in part,
by drought conditions. Climate summaries indicate that
drought conditions and higher than average tempera-
tures occurred over the study period (Fig. 6). In fact,
from 1996 to 2007, northern Arizona experienced one of
the most extensive and severe droughts recorded since
the 1950s (Weiss et al. 2009). Climate reconstructions
from tree-ring data indicate that 2002 was the third dri-
est year in the last 1400 years (Salzer and Kipfmueller
2005). In addition, average daily temperatures for the
2001 to 2010 decade were the highest on record since
1900, and this decade was also one of the warmest pe-
riods of comparable length in at least 600 years (Garfin
et al. 2013).
Numerous studies have documented widespread tree
mortality
during
the
latter
twentieth
and
early
twenty-first
centuries,
driven
primarily
by
regional
warming trends and drought (Van Mantgem et al. 2009;
Allen et al. 2010; Williams et al. 2013; Clark et al. 2016).
Drought and high temperature in combination is known
to increase rate of carbon starvation in Southwestern co-
nifers and exacerbate tree mortality (Adams et al. 2009).
Several studies have documented punctuated aspen mor-
tality coinciding with the severe drought of 2002, along
with subsequent mortality due to insects and disease
(Fairweather et al. 2008; Ganey and Vojta 2011; Kane
and Kolb 2014). Similar aspen mortality over the last
two
decades
has been
documented
and
linked
to
drought
and
higher
temperatures
as
well
as
to
insect-caused defoliation, herbivory, and pathogens, par-
ticularly on marginal sites (Rehfeldt et al. 2009; Zegler et
al. 2012; Worrall et al. 2013). Our observations of high
aspen mortality from 2011 to 2016 add to concerns for
this species in a warming climate. Further, ponderosa
pine mortality (34%) between 2002 and 2016 on un-
burned plots, along with similar mortality on moderate-
and
high-severity
plots,
show
that
even
the
most
drought-tolerant species on our site was apparently af-
fected by adverse climatic conditions.
Current conditions
Forest structural changes resulting from fire and second-
ary mortality, particularly reduction in small-diameter
trees in areas of high pre-fire cover, appeared to move
tree density and basal area closer to historical conditions
(i.e., pre-fire-exclusion) at the site (Cocke et al. 2005b).
For example, Cocke et al. (2005b) estimated historical
tree densities and basal area to be 61.4 trees ha−1 and
7.6 m2 ha−1, respectively, for ponderosa pine, and
160.9 trees ha−1 and 17.9 m2 ha−1, respectively, for
mixed-conifer forests at the study site. Structural pat-
terns similar to those occurring prior to intensive land
uses and exclusion of natural surface fire are thought to

increase forest resiliency to subsequent disturbance and
environmental stressors compared with dense stand con-
ditions widely reported where frequent-fire regimes have
been disrupted (Agee and Skinner 2005, Waltz et al.
2014, Stephens et al. 2016). Indeed, there is increasing
interest in managing lightning ignitions to achieve eco-
logical restoration objectives (Huffman et al. 2017). It is
unclear whether several other aspects of structure and
process at the site now more closely resemble historical
ranges of variability. For example, tree species compos-
ition remained dominated by ponderosa pine 15 years
after the Leroux Fire, whereas reconstructions of mixed-
conifer forests reported by Cocke et al. (2005b) show
greater historical abundance of limber pine, aspen, and
Douglas-fir. Loss of 52% and 57% of the large limber
pine and Douglas-fir trees (>40 cm diameter), respect-
ively, over the duration of the study (2000 to 2016) is
also concerning but difficult to evaluate from a historical
stand-structure
aspect.
Nevertheless,
retaining
large
trees following fires is a conservational priority because
they contribute to the overall ability of the stand to re-
generate, and they represent a rare structural legacy that
provides numerous ecosystem services. The loss of over
half of both limber pine and Douglas-fir and the lack of
regeneration of these species indicates either substan-
tially longer periods of recovery toward a mixed-conifer
forest, or a divergence from a historically mixed-conifer
forest. Our data does not allow precise analysis of spatial
patterns of trees, tree patches, or opening sizes, which
are important attributes influencing ecological function
in ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests (Rodman et
al. 2016). Lastly, it is important to note that the Leroux
Fire was human-caused, and management actions were
organized
around
fire
suppression,
rather
than
intentionally allowing the fire to burn to provide explicit
resource benefits.
Future trajectory
Increases in regeneration densities on our plots were
driven by aspen, especially in low- and moderate-fire se-
verity plots. Prolific aspen resprouting after fire is well
documented (Bailey and Whitham 2002; Stoddard et al.
2015; Yocom-Kent et al. 2015). However, aspen sprouts
in Southwestern forests commonly fail to reach tree stat-
ure if exposed to intensive herbivory, pathogens, or
reburning (Fairweather et al. 2008; Zegler et al. 2012). In
addition, aspen may reestablish on sites through top-kill
and release of suppressed meristems, but changing cli-
matic conditions and environmental stressors may re-
duce the range of persistence. In our study, aspen
regeneration increased over 800% in 2002, then fell
below pre-fire densities in 2011. Fairweather et al. (2008)
found a similar trend on the San Francisco Peaks, vis-à-
vis an increase of aspen sprouts following the death of
mature trees in 2002, and then nearly all aspen sprouts
died by 2007. Our regeneration data suggest that areas
that initially burned with low severity are more likely to
develop aspen stands and possibly mixed-conifer forest
characteristics than those that burn under moderate or
high severity.
In 2016, ponderosa pine seedlings were absent from all
but one burned plot in the Leroux Fire site. The seed-
lings present apparently established between 2012 and
2016, as we found no ponderosa pine regeneration on
any sample plots in 2011. The lack of pine regeneration
and the relatively small size of high-severity patches in
the Leroux Fire (Fig. 1) suggest factors other than seed
dispersal limited ponderosa pine regeneration. Ponder-
osa pine establishment of 3.6 to 17 trees ha−1 decade−1
has been suggested as a minimum required to maintain
open structural conditions similar to those prevailing
prior to fire regime disruption (Bailey and Covington
2002). Densities observed in our study were below this
range. Ouzts et al. (2015) found that recent wildfires
(2000 to 2005) in Arizona and New Mexico, USA,
tended to show low numbers of natural ponderosa pine
regeneration, below densities desirable according to eco-
logical restoration principles and estimated long-term
survival. Similarly, Stevens-Rumann et al. (2018), in a
multi-regional study of Western forests, found signifi-
cant decreases in post-fire regeneration in the early
twenty-first century compared with the end of the twen-
tieth century, and regeneration failure was related to
high moisture deficits during the period 2000 to 2015.
More monitoring is needed to determine successional
trajectories at our site; however, our observations sug-
gest that continued tree mortality and sparse conifer re-
generation
will
lead
to
increases
in
non-forested
conditions, or isolated aspen stands, within the Leroux
Fire site.
Conclusions
The 2001 Leroux Fire burned across a ponderosa pine
and mixed-conifer ecotone with mixed severity, with the
majority (52%) burning as low severity and likely re-
duced fuels to conditions that may reduce severity of
future fire effects. Over 15 years of observation, this site
experienced substantial secondary tree mortality, which
was likely driven by drought and high temperatures. As
climate models predict a warmer and drier climate
throughout the southwestern US (Seager et al. 2007;
Hurteau et al. 2014), geographic shifts and reductions in
distribution of dominant tree species are likely for much
of the region. Warmer temperatures and increasing fre-
quency of droughts, along with disturbances such as
wildfire, may push species past survival thresholds and

preclude regeneration (Rehfeldt et al. 2006, 2009). Re-
sults from our study demonstrate potential for forest
community changes following wildfire in a montane for-
est ecotone. Additional monitoring of this and other fire
sites is essential for informing ecosystem management in
the coming decades of changing climate.
