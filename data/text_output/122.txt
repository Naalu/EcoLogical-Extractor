Abstract—In 1913, the Fort Valley Experimental Forest initiated an unprecedented 
case-study experiment to determine the effects of harvesting methods on tree re-
generation and growth on a ponderosa pine-Gambel oak forest at Coulter Ranch in 
northern Arizona. The harvesting methods examined were seed-tree, group selection, 
and light selection. In addition, the effects of livestock grazing (excluded or not) were 
examined. We revisited the Coulter Ranch Study Site to examine the effects of these 
treatments on historical (1913) and contemporary (2003-2006) stand density and 
tree size. The key finding was that while initial 1913 harvests reduced average pine 
density by one- to two-thirds, tree densities increased from three to nine times those 
prior to harvest over the 93-year period. The greatest increase was in the seed-tree 
method.
Introduction
In 1913, Fort Valley Experimental Forest (FVEF) initiated an experiment to 
determine the effects of different timber harvesting methods on regeneration and 
growth of a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws. scopulorum Engelm.)–Gambel 
oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.) site in northern Arizona (Krauch 1916, 1937; Pearson 
1923). We investigated how three of these harvesting methods influenced tree den-
sity and size over a 93-year period. We had four questions: (1) What was stand 
density like immediately before the 1913 timber harvest? (2) How were stand 
density and mean tree size affected by each harvest method? (3) How have stand 
density and mean tree size changed over the long-term, as observed in 2003-2006? 
(4) How did livestock grazing influence contemporary stand density?

Methods
Study Site and Plot Description
This study was conducted on a 162-ha (400-ac) site located 21 km south of 
Flagstaff, Arizona on the Coconino National Forest (Figure 1); latitude 35°0.91’ N, 
longitude 111°36.26’ W. Ponderosa pine and Gambel oak are the dominant trees, 
with scattered New Mexican locust (Robinia neomexicana Gray) thickets and sin-
gle alligator junipers (Juniperus deppeana Steud.) occurring throughout the study 
area. The site (Figure 2) was established in 1913 as part of the FVEF by Hermann 
Krauch (Forest Examiner) and C.F. Korstian (Silviculturist), who initially divided 
the site into four harvesting systems: Scattered Seed-tree (61 ha or ~151 ac), Group 
selection (56 ha or ~138 ac), Light selection (45 ha or ~111 ac; originally called 
“Shelterwood” but later changed as the prescription was altered; essentially the 
same as the group selection except more mature trees were left), and the Wagner 
border method (not examined in this study). Their goals were to examine the effects 
of harvesting, grazing, and slash disposal methods on advanced regeneration, new 
seedling establishment, and residual tree growth (Krauch 1916, 1933, 1937; Lexen 
1939; Pearson 1923, 1944, 1950).

Twenty-one permanent, stem-mapped plots were established; seven per harvest-
ing system. In this study, we examined nine plots (Table 1), ranging in size from 0.8 
to 1.9 ha. We selected the largest plots, and also made sure that one plot per harvest-
ing system had been excluded from grazing. Plots are identified using the original 
FVEF naming system (Figure 2), which used a combination of letters and numbers 
representing the silvicultural unit (S5, Coulter Ranch), the harvesting system or 
method (Group selection = 1, Seed-tree = 2, or Light selection = 3) and individual 
permanent plot designations (A, B, ..., G).
Field Measurements
Historical (1913) and contemporary (2003-2006) field methods for measuring 
these plots are detailed by Moore and others (2004). Contemporary species identity 
and diameter at breast height (DBH; 1.37 m aboveground) data for all live and dead 
(stumps, snags, logs) trees were obtained in the 2003-2006 field seasons. Historical 
(1913) individual tree data were obtained from the plot ledgers located at the USFS 
RMRS Fort Valley Archives (Flagstaff, AZ). All analyses focus on trees ≥ 9.14 cm 
(3.6 inch) DBH.
Analyses
To quantify how stand density changed in the short-term (immediately following 
harvesting in 1913) and over the long-term (2003-2006; 93 years later), we exam-
ined changes in the mean number of trees per hectare and basal area (m2 ha-1) by tree 
species by harvest method. In addition, we were interested in how the stand density 
may have looked in the absence of timber harvesting in 1913, so we obtained an 
estimate of tree density and basal area in the absence of harvesting by adding the 
number and size of older cut stumps to the living tree data of 1913. Reconstruction 
model assumptions and details regarding the methods used to determine how the 
stand density may have looked in the absence of timber harvesting and the num-
ber of oak present at the time of harvest are found in Sánchez Meador (2006) and 
Sánchez Meador and others (2008).

To summarize, we examined the following three stand structural scenarios on 
each plot: (1) ‘1913 unharvested’ (stand density as if harvesting had not occurred 
in 1913); (2) ‘1913 harvested’ (actual 1913 stand density); and (3) ‘contemporary’ 
(actual 2003-2006 stand density) for each harvest method.
Results
While the 1913 harvest reduced average pine density (for tree ≥ 9.14 cm DBH) 
by one- to two-thirds (Figure 3), tree densities at the end of the 93-year period were 
three (Light selection) to nine (Seed-tree) times higher than those observed prior 
to harvest. Reconstructed (1913) tree density was highest on S5C1 (164 trees ha-1) 
Figure 3. Historical (a) and Contemporary (b) tree density (tree ha-1) for ponderosa pine 
and reconstructed Gambel oak trees ( ≥ 9.14 cm DBH) on plots at the Coulter Ranch 
Study Site. Historical densities include trees that were reconstructed because they were 
either harvested prior to (Harvested Pine* - light grey) or not measured at the time of plot 
establishment (Live Oak* - dark grey).

and was lowest on S5E2 (75 trees ha-1). Similar trends were observed for mean 
basal area (e.g., Figures 3 & 4) and DBH (not shown), which prior to harvest were 
19.0 m2 ha-1 (s = 4.5) and 38.3 cm (s = 7.5), respectively. Contemporary mean 
basal area and DBH for all plots (regardless of grazing history) had increased to 
34.2 m2 ha-1 (s = 12.4) and decreased to 21.0 cm (s = 5.1), respectively. Contemporary 
(2003-2006) tree density was highest on S5B2 (1492 trees ha-1), lowest on S5D3 
(317 trees ha-1), and found to be higher on plots where livestock grazing was  
excluded (e.g., Figure 5), regardless of harvesting method.

Discussion and Conclusions
Overall, both pine and oak densities increased with each harvesting system, but 
the seed-tree had the largest increase and the light selection had the least. Previous 
research on these sites showed that pine recruitment, over the past 93 years, oc-
curred commonly in interspaces or canopy gap (e.g., Figure 6) and away from older, 
live trees or residual tree patches (Sánchez Meador and others 2008).
The tree density differences observed in the harvest methods are not surprising, 
though there are few long-term studies that quantify these differences. The Seed-
tree method essentially removed the overstory, leaving only a few widely spaced 
trees to provide for uniformly distributed seed. Drastically opening the tree canopy, 
and increased disturbance to the forest floor by the harvest itself, likely increased the 
sites for ponderosa pine seedlings to establish. The Light group selection method, 
on the other hand, harvested mature and older pines, either isolated or in groups.

The circles indicate the plot corner in each photo. Note the even-aged recruitment 
in foreground near plot corner, general increases in tree density, the complete 
decomposition of logging slash, and increased numbers of small trees throughout. The 
1913 photo was taken by H. Krauch (USFS photo 17011A), and the 2006 photo by A.J.

These overall increases in tree density are consistent with the structural changes 
in ponderosa pine ecosystems reported throughout Arizona (Fulé and others 1997, 
Mast and others 1999, Moore and others 2004). Contemporary stand conditions 
(increased density and smaller trees) most likely resulted from numerous pulses of 
pine establishment in the early 1900s (Savage and others 1996, Sánchez Meador 
and others 2008) following heavy livestock grazing and intensive harvesting (e.g., 
seed-tree or clearcut systems). Intense grazing provided favorable seedbeds for 
seedling establishment, similar to those created historically by fire or more recently 
by harvesting, and when combined with fire exclusion would allow an unusually 
high density of trees to become established and persist (Bakker and Moore 2007, 
Cooper 1960, Mast and others 1999, White 1985).
Although we found differences in tree densities among the harvest treatments in 
1913 and 2003-2006, and also differences due to livestock grazing, we must inter-
pret these results with caution. Our ability to draw causal inferences is limited by 
the lack of treatment replication, which is a common problem in assessing change 
using retrospective studies (Carpenter 1990) and with case studies in general.

circles indicate the plot corner in each photo. Note the increased numbers of small trees 
in 2006, the presence of ladder fuels, the complete decomposition of logging slash, and 
loss of herbaceous plants in the understory. The 1913 photo was taken by H. Krauch 
(USFS photo 16976A), and the 2006 photo by A.J. Sánchez Meador.

In addition, we also note that the 1913 reconstructed data (unharvested scenario) do 
not represent presettlement reference conditions (Kaufmann and others 1994, Fulé 
and others 1997, Moore and others 1999). The 1913 unharvested scenarios embod-
ies some 30+ years of fire exclusion and intense livestock grazing.
Despite the cautions and limitations, historical permanent plot data can provide 
unique opportunities to quantify temporal and spatial changes in forest structure, 
and to determine the impacts of past land-use (harvesting, livestock grazing, fire 
exclusion), natural disturbances, and climate.
