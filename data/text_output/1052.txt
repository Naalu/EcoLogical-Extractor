The Ecological Restoration Institute Announces New
Executive Director
After a national search, the Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI) at Northern
Arizona University has named prominent quantitative forest ecologist and
cutting-edge researcher Andrew Sánchez Meador as its new executive director.
He replaces ERI founder and long-time executive director Wally Covington,
who retired in January.
 
Sánchez Meador is a trusted expert among ecologists, scientists and land
managers for his high-impact research in forestry and ecological restoration
and innovative approach to science delivery and communication.
 
He is joining the ERI from NAU’s School of Forestry, where he served as
faculty for eight years and is an associate professor of forest biometrics and
quantitative ecology. Sánchez Meador’s scholarly interests have largely been
focused on ecological restoration of frequent-ﬁre forests of the southwestern
United States; improving scientists’ understanding of how disturbances, such
as wildﬁre, shape forests; and championing the incorporation of new
technologies in forestry and ecological restoration practices.
 
“As the executive director, I’m thrilled to have the opportunity to build on the
ERI and NAU’s core strengths of outstanding academics, research, public
service and creative problem solving,” Sánchez Meador said. “I’m keenly
interested in how new innovations from outside the forestry and restoration
sector can be adopted to increase our effectiveness and capacity to do forest
restoration.”
 
Sánchez Meador is a well-known innovator in the areas of forest and
landscape-level data collection and analysis. His forward-looking approach to
using remote sensing tools, data visualization techniques and emerging
technology will continue to help modernize and advance the restoration of
forest ecosystems.
