Public Perceptions of Forest
Management in North Central
Arizona: The Paradox of
Demanding More Involvement but
Allowing Limits to Legal Action

National-level forest policy is changing in response to social pressure to “improve forest health.” A
particularly ﬁerce public debate surrounds the forest health impacts of administrative appeals, lawsuits,
public involvement, and federal agency ability to balance managerial efﬁciency, ecological health, and
social expectations. A self-administered mail survey was conducted in 2003 to assess public opinion on
litigation and forest restoration in north central Arizonan communities in the ponderosa pine ecosystem.
Although results indicate some support for limits to the right to ﬁle suit, appeal, and review
environmental decisions, an overwhelming number of respondents indicate a strong desire to be more
informed and involved in forest management decisions.
Keywords: forest restoration, public participation, appeals, ponderosa pine, north central Arizona
A
fter a series of costly and expensive
ﬁre seasons in the late 1990s and
early 21st century land managers,
politicians, and the general public have
given increased attention to the ecological
health of western, ﬁre-adapted forests. One
result is that national-level forest policy is
changing in response to social pressure to
“improve forest health.” A particularly ﬁerce
public debate surrounds the consequences of
administrative appeals, lawsuits, and public
involvement on planning. Much of this con-
troversy touches on the mission of the
USDA Forest Service and its ability to bal-
ance forest health, managerial efﬁciency,
and social expectations. Although politi-
cians, agency heads, and nongovernment or-
ganizations (NGOs) line up on either side of
the debate surrounding whether to limit or
change public participation, the voice of the
public remains largely unheard. As a result,
in 2003 we conducted a survey of north cen-
tral Arizona residents within the ponderosa
pine ecosystem on their perceptions and pol-
icy preferences for a wide range of topics
within the context of forest restoration.
Federal land managers face the chal-
lenge of balancing local opinions and eco-
nomic expectations with national values and
goals (Brunson and Shindler 2004). They
must balance ecological health with amenity
values such as timber products, visitor ac-
cess, and community safety (e.g., from a nat-
ural process such as ﬁre). In all cases the For-
est Service must have public support to do its
job. However, the Forest Service can not
completely satisfy all interest groups all of
the time. Agencies, Congress, and the ad-
ministration must understand what the pub-
lic expects or will tolerate in regard to forest
management and public participation.
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) eco-
systems are frequent ﬁre return ecosystems
that have been altered by a 100 years of ﬁre
suppression, logging, and grazing activities
(Moore et al. 1999). Presently, millions of
acres of ponderosa pine forests in the Amer-
ican southwest are vulnerable to insect and
disease infestations and large, stand-replac-
ing ﬁres. Forestwide action is called for to
restore composition, structure, and function
to improve forest health and reduce the pos-
sibility of catastrophic wildﬁre (Moore et al.
1999, Allen et al. 2002). The most immedi-
ate actions have been adjacent to at-risk
communities; consequently, restoration and
forest health management have been placed
squarely in public view. This analysis explores
dimensions of the public’s opinion of litiga-
tion, participation, and the role of the Forest
Service in Arizona’s ponderosa pine belt.

Because Arizona’s population is both
dynamic and diverse (in terms of age, in-
come, education, length of time living in Ar-
izona, and rural or urban setting), we were
particularly interested in examining how de-
mographic factors relate to restoration pol-
icy preferences. Contextual factors, includ-
ing setting (geographic and residential),
have been identiﬁed as important dimen-
sions in the study of social acceptability of
natural resource issues (Shindler et al.
2002a, Brunson and Shindler 2004). De-
mographic information provides clues as to
trends in policy preferences and may indi-
cate how agencies can direct their efforts to
communicate to the public. For instance,
agencies may wonder if there is a difference
between rural and urban preferences. Brun-
son and Evans (2005) found that rural resi-
dents in Utah were less likely than metropol-
itan residents to believe federal agencies can
use prescribed ﬁre effectively and that rural
respondents had less trust of federal ofﬁcials.
Agencies also may ask, are younger or older
people more receptive to restoration or lim-
its to environmental litigation? Does educa-
tion level inﬂuence whether limitations to
participation are acceptable, or does length
of residency in north central Arizona inﬂu-
ence policy perceptions? Examining these
contextual issues as they relate to policy pref-
erences will help managers and policymakers
better understand the publics they serve and
may provide insights on the social and polit-
ical context for restoration in a rapidly
changing state such as Arizona (Hall and
Bigler-Cole 2001).
Legal Wrangling
Although debate over the proper role of
land-management agencies, the public, and
the courts reaches back decades (Coulombe
2004, Vaughn and Cortner 2005), the most
current policy dispute over “who is to blame
for our forest conditions” can be traced back
to the destructive ﬁre season of 2000, in-
cluding the 48,000-ac Cerro Grande ﬁre
near Los Alamos (Vaughn 2003). Political
responses included calls to revise and
streamline laws that govern environmental
review and public involvement. The impli-
cation was that procedural and environmen-
tal laws were partly to blame for the action
(or inaction) that contributed to major wild-
ﬁres. Agencies may view lawsuits and ap-
peals as impediments to solid, science-based
land management. Individuals, businesses,
and NGOs may view lawsuits and appeals as
a resort to force agencies to “properly” man-
age resources. The drawback to procedural
streamlining may be the possible reduction
of public participation in planning. The ad-
vantages may be more efﬁcient planning and
implementation.
In June 2002, the Forest Service re-
leased a report with the central theme that
“the Forest Service operates within a statu-
tory, regulatory, and administrative frame-
work that has kept the agency from effec-
tively addressing rapid declines in forest
health” (USDA 2002a, 5). Excessive analysis
and ineffective public involvement were
identiﬁed along with management inefﬁ-
ciencies as major elements of the “process
predicament,” and planning and analysis
were estimated to consume 40% of the agen-
cy’s budget. President George W. Bush reit-
erated the conclusions during his unveiling
of the Healthy Forests Initiative (HFI) in
2002:
And we have a problem with the regulatory
body there in Washington. I mean, there’s
so many regulations, and so much red tape,
that it takes a little bit of effort to ball up the
efforts to make the forests healthy. And
plus, there’s just too many lawsuits, just
endless litigation. . . there’s a ﬁne balance
between people expressing their selves and
their opinions and using litigation to keep
the United States of America from enacting
commonsense forest policy (White House
2002).
The administration attempted to rem-
edy these problems through new HFI guide-
lines that exempted a number of forest
health-related projects from environmental
analysis requirements under the 1970 Na-
tional Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
and restricted opportunities for individuals
to appeal agency decisions (Neznek 2004).
These policy changes and their underlying
problem deﬁnition were strongly supported
by most congressional Republicans, many
within the agencies, and the wood products
industry. Environmental organizations and
some congressional Democrats accused the
administration of cutting off mechanisms
for public involvement as a means of pro-
moting commercial harvesting on public
lands (Vaughn and Cortner 2005). The ran-
cor and rhetoric has done little to expedite
forest management.
In 2001, Senator Larry Craig (Republi-
can of Idaho) and Representative Scott
McInnis (Republican of Colorado) asked
the General Accounting Ofﬁce (GAO, since
renamed the Government Accountability
Ofﬁce) to investigate the impact of appeals
and litigation on fuel reduction projects.
The GAO found that during the 2001 ﬁscal
year to date, only about 1% of all fuel reduc-
tion projects had been appealed and none
had been litigated (GAO 2001). The Forest
Service soon released its own report which
contradicted the GAO’s ﬁndings, stating
that in ﬁscal years 2001 and 2002, 48% of all
mechanical fuel reduction projects were ap-
pealed and 6% litigated (USDA 2002b).
Subsequent GAO reports highlighted
divergent conclusions regarding the effect of
appeals and litigation on fuel reduction
projects; “only a few local land unit ofﬁcials
[that the GAO] visited indicated that this
type of resistance [appeals and litigation]
had delayed particular fuels reduction treat-
ments” (GAO 2003a, 27). Adverse weather
conditions and the diversion of fuel reduc-
tion funds to ﬁreﬁghting were cited as more
prominent obstacles to treatments. A subse-
quent October 2003 report found that 24%
of all fuel reduction decisions and 58% of all
decisions that could be appealed were ap-
pealed in ﬁscal years 2001 and 2002 and 3%
of all fuel reduction decisions were litigated
(GAO 2003b). Further analysis muddied
the waters of just who is doing the appealing:
NGOs, business, tribes, or individuals
(Teich et al. 2004).
Despite the muddy relationship be-
tween appeals/litigation and the efﬁcacy of
fuel reduction treatments, Congress elimi-
nated administrative appeals for certain haz-
ardous fuel projects with the passage of the
2003 Healthy Forests Restoration Act
(HFRA) replacing them with a predecisional
objection process (PL 108–148). HFRA
also placed certain restrictions on legal re-
view of authorized projects and reduced the
environmental
analysis
required
under
NEPA. HFRA also sought to increase com-
munity involvement in forest management
by prioritizing funding and management at-
tention to communities with completed
Community
Wildﬁre
Protection
Plans.
How land-management agencies solicit and
consider public input and what avenues are
available to those who disagree are topics of
ongoing debate despite the passage of
HFRA.
Investigations of this policy debate have
focused on the complex relationships be-
tween appeals, litigation, and public in-
volvement (Cortner et al. 2003, Malmshei-
mer et al. 2004, Vaughn and Cortner 2005)
and provided policy analysis to help account
for the beneﬁts and costs of appeals (Mor-
timer et al. 2004). However, public opinion
of the inﬂuence of national policies on forest
376

practices has received relatively little atten-
tion. In one of the few studies to probe pub-
lic opinion on the topic, Shindler and To-
man (2003) found that 68% of surveyed
northeast Oregon respondents believed “na-
tional restrictions and regulations” were pre-
venting local forest managers from doing
their jobs. Sixty-ﬁve percent believed that
local managers were trustworthy but were
hampered in their jobs by the federal gov-
ernment. Vaughn (2003) reports that a poll
of Arizona residents in the wake of the de-
structive
Rodeo-Chediski
ﬁre
of
2002
showed 61% believing the ﬁre was the result
of “legal maneuvering” by environmentalists.
Somewhat more research has focused
on public perceptions of public-agency in-
teractions and participation. In 1996, 62%
of residents in the Blue Mountains of Ore-
gon agreed with the statement “citizen par-
ticipation is of moderate/great value even if
it adds to the cost of government,” while
only 14% felt that citizen participation was
of no or little value (Shindler and Reed
1996). Similarly, 61% of Washington and
Oregon residents surveyed in 2001–2002
disagreed that “too much public involve-
ment in decisions” was a threat to forest
health while 30% agreed (Shindler et al.
2002b). A national poll in 1994 found that
88% of Americans agreed at least somewhat
that “it is important for the Federal Govern-
ment to interact with the American people
about all public forests matters,” with 60%
agreeing
strongly
(Hammond
1994).
Eighty-six percent agreed that “the Ameri-
can public should take an active role in man-
aging and protecting public forests.” How-
ever, only 51% agreed with the statement “I
am aware of how to participate in the man-
agement, care, and use of public forests”
(Hammond 1994).
Because “the public” is actually made
up of a multitude of different “publics”
(Shindler et al. 2002a), there is an ongoing
need to examine not only how a population
views land management, but also to investi-
gate differences within that population. Pre-
vious natural resource studies have found
signiﬁcant differences within populations
based on, among other things, age (Jones
and Dunlap 1992), gender (Fortmann and
Kusel 1990), income (Vaske et al. 2001),
educational background (Vaske et al. 2001),
and residential setting (i.e., urban versus ru-
ral; Lowe and Pinhey [1982]), as well as geo-
graphic differences (Shindler et al. 1993,
Brunson and Shindler 2004). Because of the
rapid pace of change in north central Arizo-
na’s population and demographics, there is a
compelling need to examine how demo-
graphic variables interact with attitudes to-
ward forest management and policy.
One study on north central Arizona res-
idents reported the broad trend that respon-
dents generally supported prescribed ﬁre as
part of ecological restoration and to mitigate
wildﬁres (see Ostergren and Ruther [2005]).
This study is a deeper analysis of north cen-
tral Arizona residents that investigates their
opinion of how forest management deci-
sions are made. In particular, we investigate
their perceptions of legal challenges to deci-
sions and their associated demand for partic-
ipation. We further investigate demographic
characteristics of respondents to provide a
clear picture of which sector of the public
holds each policy preference or opinion.
Methods
North central Arizona contains a di-
verse range of communities, from the urban
university town of Flagstaff (population,
60,000) to smaller rural communities along
the Mogollon Rim with cultural and eco-
nomic ties to ranching and timber. North
central Arizona has experienced steady pop-
ulation growth in recent years. Increased de-
velopment at the wildland-urban interface
adds risk to forest health issues as illustrated
by the destruction of over 400 structures in
the 460,000-ac Rodeo-Chediski ﬁre of
2002. The common denominator for our
sample population is that they live in the
ponderosa pine ecosystem and thus face sim-
ilar consequences from natural resource
management. Issues with particularly high
salience include forest restoration, pre-
scribed burns, increased number and size of
wildﬁres, and forest resource use. The sam-
ple area for this study was determined by
laying a zip code map over a vegetation map
of Arizona. Thirty-ﬁve zip codes overlaid the
ponderosa ecosystem. The ponderosa pine
ecosystem starts at the Utah border and
north rim of the Grand Canyon National
Park and stretches southeast through Flag-
staff along the Mogollon Rim and the Fort
Apache Reservation to the New Mexico bor-
der with an “island” that includes Prescott
(for a map see ForestERA [Ecosystem Res-
toration Analysis; 2006]). A random sample
of 1,729 residents, stratiﬁed by postal zip
codes, was purchased from Genesys Sam-
pling in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania.
The US Postal Service approved 1,644 ad-
dresses as current and in use. Our target pop-
ulation was adult (more than 18 years old)
seasonal or permanent residents that have
lived in the region 1 year or longer. Not all
residents of north central Arizona will have
the same opinion on policy issues so we
broke down responses by demographics to
try to assess responses at a deeper level. The
independent variables were selected based
on current literature and a survey of re-
searchers in the ﬁeld (Shindler et al. 1993,
Brunson et al. 1997, Cortner et al. 2003).
We used a self-administered mail sur-
vey to assess public opinion in 2003 1 year
after the Rodeo-Chediski ﬁre. Four mailings
were sent to the selected respondents start-
ing with a prenotice letter (Dillman 2000).
The second mailing contained the 131-item
questionnaire, an explanatory cover letter,
stamped return envelope, and an incentive
of two postage stamps. This was followed by
a reminder postcard and then a replacement
questionnaire was mailed with the ﬁnal con-
tact. Of the 1,644 questionnaires sent, 27
were undeliverable, resulting in a sample of
1,617 residents. Forty-six percent (n  750)
of the questionnaires were returned. Fifty-
seven of the questionnaires were unusable,
for a total sample size of 693. This return
rate of 43% is consistent with other natural
resource-focused mail survey return rates
(Connelly et al. 2003).
To assess nonresponse bias, nonrespon-
dents were contacted by phone and asked a
sample of questions for comparison. Of 174
nonrespondents called, 22 participated, 37
refused, 44 numbers were disconnected, 3
respondents were deceased, and 66 could
not be contacted after repeated calls. We at-
tribute nonresponse to the high seasonal
population in north central Arizona. Al-
though the sample was too small for statisti-
cal analysis, the 22 who did answer our sub-
set of questions were consistent with our
demographics and results.
Results
The participating respondents were
mostly white men, aged 45–65 years, and
comparatively well educated. Eighty-eight
percent of the respondents reported their
ethnicity as white. US Census Bureau data
for Flagstaff indicate that only 77% are
white, Therefore, we assume the sample un-
derrepresents Native Americans (1.2% ver-
sus 10%) and Hispanics (4% versus 10.9%)
and do not draw any conclusions based on
race. Mean respondent age was 57.8 years
old (n  676; SD  14.33), with age rang-
ing from 19 to 93 years. This age range does
not match Census Bureau 2000 statistics but
Journal of Forestry • October/November 2006

is consistent with a voting population, the
group we assume would participate in deci-
sionmaking (Theodori and Luloff 2002).
Respondents had lived in north central Ari-
zona from 1 to 82 years with an average of
17.2 years (n  661; SD  14.83). Fifty-six
percent have lived here for more than 10
years. Ninety-one percent of respondents
were permanent residents. Respondents re-
ported an average of 15.5 years of formal
education completed (n  673; SD 
3.01). Sixty-eight percent of respondents
were men, whereas 32% were women,
which is slightly skewed from an even gender
ratio reported by the US Census Bureau in
2000. A plurality of the respondents re-
ported an income of $30,000–59,999 (38%).
Sixty percent of respondents reported living in
rural areas and 39.9% reported living in an
urban area (i.e., Flagstaff).
The survey had several goals and was
relatively large (presurvey time tests were
about 25 minutes). Several sections ad-
dressed topics broadly split between forest
restoration and mountain lion policy. The
sections designed to assess public opinion
used a ﬁve-point Likert scale by providing a
statement and then asking respondents to
indicate whether they strongly agreed,
agreed, neither agreed nor disagreed, dis-
agreed, or strongly disagreed. Strongly agree
and agree were collapsed for our analysis to
increase power and applicability of the re-
sults, as were strongly disagree and disagree
(see Tables 2 and Table 3). Data regarding
demographic characteristics originally col-
lected on a continuous scale were catego-
rized for the chi-square analysis (see Tables 2
and Table 3). First, we looked at the agree/
disagree responses to indicate broad prefer-
ences and then used a chi-square strategy to
highlight demographic differences. All per-
centages are at the 95% conﬁdence level, ac-
curate to within 5%.
The responses in Table 1 indicate mod-
erate support for limiting environmental re-
view and legal avenues to challenge agency
decisions. Fifty-seven percent of respon-
dents agreed or strongly agreed (hereafter ex-
pressed as “agreed”) that “the right to sue the
government about forestry projects should
be temporarily banned.” Limiting the right
to appeal forest projects was similarly sup-
ported by 57% of respondents. Limiting en-
vironmental review requirements was only
supported by 50% of respondents, and 36%
strongly disagreed or disagreed (hereafter
“disagreed”) that we should limit reviews.
The implication is that although there is ma-
jority support among respondents in north
central Arizona to limit the ability to con-
test/oppose forests projects, there is not
overwhelming support for those limits. The
strongest action (i.e., a lawsuit) provoked
the strongest reaction (i.e., support to ban
lawsuits).
The next three statements shed tremen-
dous light on just how respondents in north
central Arizona feel about participation.
Ninety percent of respondents indicated
that communication between federal agen-
cies and local communities should improve.
By any measure this is a strong statement to
federal agencies that despite all the good
work of public information ofﬁcers, they can
do more. Furthermore, if federal agencies
are going to initiate restoration projects,
91% of the public wants to be informed and
89% would like to be involved. We believe
the respondents interpreted “restoration
projects” to include both ecological restora-
tion and fuels reduction projects, which, in
this context, means mechanical thinning
and prescribed burning. In addition, 66% of
respondents agreed that ﬁre education
should be the responsibility of local govern-
ments such as ﬁre departments. The impli-
cation is that as the Forest Service prescribes
more ﬁres, conducts thinning in preparation
for those ﬁres, or undertakes a comprehen-
sive restoration project, one trusted avenue
to inform and involve the public is the local
ﬁre department.
The ﬁnal set of Likert scale responses
indicates that 57% of respondents trust the
professional forester/scientist enough to ex-

clusively conduct restoration, and 58% of
our respondents believe that the forest is
there to provide income and jobs. However,
80% of respondents think that the Forest
Service budget should not rely on the pro-
duction of commercial timber. Only 8%
support that role for commercial timber.
These ﬁndings are consistent with those in a
national forest values poll (Hammond
1994), which found that Americans believe
maintaining a healthy environment is a
more important role for public land-
management agencies than producing com-
modities. If respondents in our survey desire
limitations on appeals, lawsuits, and envi-
ronmental review, it may be because of an
interest in encouraging restoration of forest
health rather than in promoting commercial
timber harvesting for its own sake.
We used chi-square analysis to draw
distinctions within these ﬁndings (Table 2).
Demographic dimensions of our survey
population reveal that the length of time re-
spondents lived in north central Arizona and
their level of education are particularly im-
portant determinants of attitudes on these
topics. Age, gender, and residential setting
(urban versus rural) were important demo-
graphic variables in selected cases. In gen-
eral, longer-term residents of north central
Arizona were more likely to support bypass-
ing environmental review requirements,
more likely to say that communication be-
tween agencies and communities needs to
improve, and more likely to believe that na-
tional forest management should generate
income for people.
A strong trend is that with more educa-
tion, a resident is less likely to agree that
there should be a ban or limit on lawsuits,
appeals, and reviews. Among those who ﬁn-
ished some high school, 62% agreed to a ban
on lawsuits, as did 58% of those who ﬁn-
ished some college and 48% of those who
completed some graduate school (P 
0.031). On the question of limiting appeals,
58% of those who completed some high
school agreed, 58% of those who ﬁnished
some college agreed, and 49% of those who
completed some graduate school agreed
(P  0.001). For bypassing environmental
reviews, 58% of those who completed some
high school agreed, as did 52% of those who
ﬁnished some college and 39% of those who
ﬁnished some graduate school (P  0.001).
Those in rural settings are more likely
to support a ban on lawsuits (64%) versus
48% of those in an urban area (P  0.001).
Fifty-eight percent of those living in a rural
area agreed with a bypass of environmental
review versus 40% of those living in an ur-
ban area (P  0.001). The implication is
that residents in rural areas will support lim-
its on litigation that expedite forest projects.
In addition, one age group showed particu-
larly strong support for limiting appeals,
lawsuits, and environmental review. Among
those aged 61–75 years, 64% agree that the
right to sue may be banned, 62% agree that
the right to appeal may be limited, and 57%
agree that we may bypass environmental re-
view.
Length of residence in north central Ar-
izona also is related to opinion on whether
federal agencies should communicate more,
inform residents of restoration projects, and
involve residents in projects. Respondents
who were the shortest-term residents were
less critical of the current pattern of commu-
nication. Among those who have lived in
north central Arizona for 1–3 years, 81%
agreed that communication should be bet-
ter, and 91% of those who have lived here
for 4–6 years, 94% of those who have lived

here for 7–10 years, and 89% of those who
have lived here for more than 10 years agreed
(P  0.001). Conversely, 96% of 1- to
3-year residents agreed they should be better
informed, as did 94% of residents for 4–6
years, 90% of 7- to 10-year residents, and
89% of 10 year residents (P  0.015).
Among those who have lived in north cen-
tral Arizona for 0–3 years 92% agreed that
local residents should be more involved.
This declined slightly to 91% for 4- to
6-year residents, 90% for 7- to 10-year resi-
dents, and 86% for residents of more 10
years (P  0.002). Apparently, if a federal
agency is looking for people who may vol-
unteer for a project, the newer residents are
most likely. But these differences are rela-
tively minor because roughly 90% of all res-
idents wanted more communication, infor-
mation, and local residents to be involved
(Table 1).
Our ﬁnal chi-squared analysis explored
opinions on the role of professionals/scien-
tists in restoration and the purpose of our
national forests (Table 3). Whether a re-
spondent agreed with “national forests
should generate income for local residents,”
depended on the length of time they have
lived in north central Arizona. Among those
here for 1–3 years, 51% agreed with this
statement, for 4–6 years 52% agreed, for
7–10 years 61% agreed, and among those
who have lived here for more than 10 years,
57% agreed with this statement (P 
0.014). Longer-term residents (more than 7
years) were more likely to believe the forest
should generate income.
Among those who completed some
high school, 61% agreed that “national for-
est management should generate income for
people.” Among those who ﬁnished some
college, 56% agreed with this statement.
Among those who completed some graduate
school, 53% agreed with this statement (P 
0.022). These results are consistent with an
assumption that those with higher educa-
tion may ﬁnd employment that does not de-
pend directly on forest resources. This trend
holds for the statement that the Forest Ser-
vice budget should not depend on produc-
ing commercial timber, although in this case
it is not signiﬁcant. Among those who com-
pleted some high school, 75% agreed with
this statement, as did 80% of those who ﬁn-
ished some college and 81% of those who
completed some graduate school (P 
0.349). If respondents thought this through,
the implication is that despite the fact that
higher educated respondents will have
higher paying jobs and will pay more in
taxes, they support a federal agency that does
not depend heavily on timber receipts.
However, the chi-square test on income did
not indicate a similar difference.
Residents who have lived in north cen-
tral Arizona 4–6 years are more likely to
agree with the statement, “Forest restoration
should be done only by trained scientists or
professionals.” Among respondents who
have lived in north central Arizona for 1–3
years, 56% strongly agreed; of 4- to 6-year
residents, 75% strongly agreed; of 7- to 10-
year residents, 58% strongly agreed; and of
those who have lived here for more than 10
years, 51% strongly agreed with this state-
ment (P  0.002).
Discussion and Conclusion
The patterns revealed by this survey of
north central Arizonans in the wake of re-
cent intense ﬁre seasons are complex indeed.
There is substantial public support to expe-
dite the pace of forest restoration by limiting
the inﬂuence and delay of appeals, lawsuits,
and environmental review. The apparent
paradox is that an overwhelming majority
also want to be informed and want local res-
idents to be involved in the planning pro-
cess. Although supporting a suspension of
legal mechanisms for contesting Forest Ser-
vice decision may be interpreted as a higher
level of trust for the agency, the public
clearly wants more communication and
involvement. This suggests that the public
may want more accessible, less legalistic
avenues to engage in Forest Service
decisionmaking.
Three statements focused on some sort
of limit to the current legal strategies avail-
able to the public to contest forest deci-
sions—the three strategies that have received
most of the political attention. Taken at face
value, approximately one-half of the respon-
dents who live in north central Arizona pon-
derosa pine ecosystems support some limits
on legal mechanisms for participation in-
cluding bans on lawsuits (57%), limits on
appeals (57%), and bypassing the environ-
mental review process (50%). These tended
to be people who live in rural Arizona, where
we assume a higher proportion of income
depends on forests and where safety from
large ﬁres certainly depends on acting sooner
rather than later to reduce fuels. People with

more education tended to be less supportive
of limits. People in the age group of 61–75
years tended to favor limitations, an age
group that represents a signiﬁcant voting
block. The implication of our data is that the
decision to expedite some forest projects (as
outlined in HFRA) has substantial public
support. However, the evidence across all
demographics indicates moderate accep-
tance of limitations on legal recourse to fed-
eral decisions, and any entity that wishes to
sway popular opinion one direction or an-
other faces a challenging task.
The most signiﬁcant information for
managers is in the set of statements focused
on being informed or involved with forest
management (i.e., restoration) decisions.
Overwhelmingly, 90% of respondents want
better communication with federal agencies.
Citizens also want to be informed about
(91%) and want local residents to be in-
volved with (90%) local restoration projects.
Respondents who have lived in the region
for a shorter term are less likely to criticize
communication with federal agencies, but
those same short-term respondents place a
high premium on being informed and in-
volved. Possible explanations are that either
respondents who have lived here shorter pe-
riods of time have not had a chance to be
disappointed with communication or the
Forest Service has improved its communica-
tion in recent years. Based on the amount of
information in the news media on restora-
tion, wildﬁres, and forest management, and
the high visibility of ﬁre events such as Ro-
deo-Chediski, we believe the Forest Service
is doing a better job of communicating with
residents and that longer-term residents may
need more evidence of change, but in either
case there is plenty of room for improve-
ment. The public wants to have information
and the agency should not be abashed at pro-
viding that information.
There may be some question as to what
“being informed” really means for residents.
Is it merely a notice posted at information
kiosks and in the paper, or is it a sit-down
discussion about options? We believe that
the combination of data indicates that “be-
ing informed and involved” means more
than reading a notice in the paper of deci-
sions already made. These are the same peo-
ple who favored limiting the legal process for
participation but, clearly, they are interested
in what the federal agencies are doing. We
acknowledge that this same segment of our
respondents may not litigate a Forest Service
decision, but if one assumes that the Forest
Service needs public support for manage-
ment actions, restricting public participa-
tion in the NEPA process and/or restricting
legal recourse in the event a decision is con-
tested may have long-term negative conse-
quences for federal agencies. An important
ﬁnding, then, is that managers should not
assume that legal avenues such as the NEPA
and appeals processes satisfy public desires to
be informed and to inﬂuence agency man-
agement. For much of the public, these are
unsatisfactory avenues for engagement, and
many expect the Forest Service to take a
more active role in communication and
involvement.
One way to view these conclusions is
that the public holds a negative perception
as to how public participation is imple-
mented. It may be that residents of north
central Arizona desire public involvement
that is less legalistic and technical. The par-
adox is that the review/appeals process in
NEPA and the 1982 National Forest Man-
agement Act (NFMA) regulations guaran-
tees, by law, that the public must be involved
in forest planning (36 CFR 219 et. seq.
1982). Recent revisions to NFMA regula-
tions are less clear but include a mandate to
“provide opportunities for the public to col-
laborate and participate openly and mean-
ingfully in the planning process” (see 36
CFR § 219 Fed. Reg. [Jan. 5, 2005]).
Whether the new NFMA regulations limit
participation is debatable, but between
NEPA and NFMA public participation is
the law. Perhaps laws, legal recourse, and
step-by-step administrative processes for
participation are unsatisfactory to the public
and appear to be counter-productive. The
survey data indicate that although the public
is sympathetic to agencies whose plans are
restrained, they clearly expect to be involved
in those same plans. The phenomenon is the
opposite of the “not in my backyard” syn-
drome. The sentiment seems to be that pol-
icies may limit some legal rights to inﬂuence
management—butnotmyownparticipation.
In the big picture, environmental
NGOs, individuals, and businesses that use
legal recourse may just be fulﬁlling the pub-
lic imperative to be part of the land-manage-
ment process. NEPA is just one of a host of
laws that mandated public participation and
congressional oversight since the 1970s
(e.g., 1970 Clean Water Act, 1973 Endan-
gered Species Act, 1976 Federal Land Policy
and Management Act, and Government
Performance and Results Act of 1993). Born
of a general distrust of bureaucratic decision-
making, these laws are supposed to limit
agency discretion and mandate public input,
but the intention of Congress certainly was
not to stop ALL action. So how do agencies
respond as professionals and experts as they
see a need to make management decisions?
We suggest that budget dollars spent in
analysis and contacting the public are dollars
well spent. The public, at least in north cen-
tral Arizona, wants to hear that the Forest
Service will continue to manage for other
values than commercial timber even as it re-
stores the forest to a less dense, more diverse
landscape, and the public wants to be in-
formed as those actions proceed. Docu-
menting the ecological, social, and political
success of one project will undoubtedly pave
the way for future action.
Agencies should engage and involve the
public as they begin implementing new par-
adigms and build off of broadly supported
projects such as restoring ﬁre into south-
western ponderosa pine ecosystems (Abrams
and Lowe 2005, Ostergren and Ruther
2005). Support for restoration in ponderosa
pine systems is indicated in the relative lack
of opposition to prescribed ﬁre and wildland
ﬁre use policies of the Kaibab National For-
est, the extensive data from research institu-
tions such as the Ecological Research Insti-
tute, and position papers from environmental
NGOs (Crumbo and George 2005). The For-
est Service’s own report indicated that 52% of
mechanical fuel reduction projects were NOT
appealed and 94% were NOT litigated
(USDA 2002b). Apparently, there are many
successful (i.e., nonlitigated, not appealed)
projects to use as models.
Our recommendations to the public
follow a similar vein. Federal agencies may
ask, “Where are all these people who want to
be involved?” Once the Forest Service in-
forms the public of meetings or projects, the
public needs to attend those meetings and
volunteer, or, people need to help the agen-
cies design satisfactory means of engaging
the public because “attending meeting”’
may be just the sort of thing people do not
want to do. Because our results did not spec-
ify “involvement,” it is possible that involv-
ing the public may require some institu-
tional adjustment, but if accommodations
are made, the public needs to respond.
A slight majority of the public trusts
professionals enough that they believe law-
suits, appeals, and the review process can be
streamlined, but they seem adamant about
wanting to hear what those same profession-
als are going to do and to have local residents

involved in some way. Perhaps Congress
should ensure that agencies have the legal
and ﬁnancial resources to involve the public
early and often, even as those agencies suc-
ceed in projects, build trust, and are increas-
ingly freed from postdecisional review of
their actions.
