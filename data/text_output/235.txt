This document is part of the Fuels Planning: Science Synthesis and Integration Project, a pilot project
initiated by the USDA Forest Service to respond to the need for tools and information useful for plan-
ning site-specific fuel (vegetation) treatment projects. The information addresses fuel and forest condi-
tions of the dry inland forests of the Western United States: those dominated by ponderosa pine,
Douglas-fir, dry grand fir/white fir, and dry lodgepole pine potential vegetation types. Information was
developed primarily for application at the stand level and is intended to be useful within this forest
type regardless of ownership. Portions of the information also will be directly applicable to the pinyon
pine/juniper potential vegetation types. Many of the concepts and tools developed by the project may
be useful for planning fuel projects in other forest types. In particular, many of the social science find-
ings would have direct applicability to fuel planning activities for forests throughout the United States.
As is the case in the use of all models and information developed for specific purposes, our tools
should be used with a full understanding of their limitations and applicability. 
The science team, although organized functionally, worked hard at integrating the approaches,
analyses, and tools. It is the collective effort of the team members that provides the depth and
understanding of the work. The science team leadership included Deputy Science Team Leader
Sarah McCaffrey (USDA FS, North Central Research Station); forest structure and fire behavior—
Dave Peterson and Morris Johnson (USDA FS, Pacific Northwest Research Station); environmental
consequences—Elaine Kennedy-Sutherland and Anne Black (USDA FS, Rocky Mountain Research
Station); economic uses of materials—Jamie Barbour and Roger Fight (USDA FS, Pacific Northwest
Research Station); public attitudes and beliefs—Pamela Jakes and Susan Barro (USDA FS, North
Central Research Station); and technology transfer—John Szymoniak, (USDA FS, Pacific Southwest
Research Station). 
This project would not have been possible without the vision and financial support of Washington
Office Fire and Aviation Management individuals, Janet Anderson and Leslie Sekavec.

Preface

This is one of several publications to be developed by the public attitudes and beliefs team of the Fuels
Planning: Science Synthesis and Integration Project. To gather information relevant to public attitudes
and beliefs about fuels planning, we posed six questions. These questions were developed around the
tasks and challenges faced by fuels treatment planners:
• What information and tools are available to help land managers and communities collaborate in
developing fuel treatment programs?
• What information and tools are available to help managers work with communities to communicate
the risk and uncertainty of fuels treatment projects?
• What information and tools are available to evaluate the social acceptability of fuels treatments?
• What information and tools are available to describe and evaluate the aesthetic impacts of fuels
treatments?
• What information and tools are available to encourage more active involvement of private property
owners in the fuels management process?
• What information and tools are available to help us understand and evaluate the social impacts of wildfire?
Teams of scientists from universities and public agencies across the country were formed to address
each question. Each team had approximately eight weeks to produce a synthesis of science relevant to
its question and an annotated bibliography that supports the synthesis. 
While the focus of the national project was on the dry inland forests of the Western United States, the
research synthesized by the social science teams was not limited geographically. We felt the research
question being addressed was more important than the location of the research. In addition, we felt
that research addressing the human dimensions of a variety of management objectives is potentially
applicable to fuels management. For example, we assumed that information and tools developed in
Minnesota to bring together communities and agencies in addressing watershed management collabo-
ratively, across boundaries, are applicable to fuels management. 
In this publication we present the findings of the synthesis on collaboration. An annotated bibliography and
a series of manager fact sheets have been prepared to accompany this synthesis. Manager fact sheets are
available online at: http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/tech_transfer/synthesis/social_science_team/fact_sheet_ss.htm

A Synthesis of Research on Collaboration |  1
“Certainly, fire management and
suppression is an area in which
collaborative approaches make
perfect sense, and in which it
makes no sense at all to not 
collaborate.”
(Pipkin and Doerksen 2000, p. 75) 
Wildland fire professionals at the Federal, State, and local levels have a long tradition of collaboration
across agencies and jurisdictions. However, citizens, managers, and policymakers continue to express
the need for more and improved collaboration for wildland fire and fuels management. In this syn-
thesis of research on collaboration, we offer knowledge and tools to improve collaboration in the
field—at the level where wildland fire and fuels management projects are planned and implemented.
This synthesis was commissioned by the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service
(Forest Service) to aid fuels mitigation project planning under the requirements of the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). However, collaboration is not an activity that fits neatly into any
one stage of the NEPA process or chapter in a NEPA document; rather, it is an ongoing process that is
most effective when maintained at every stage of both program and project planning. Collaboration
during program planning helps ensure dialogue that can support and improve various NEPA activities
such as scoping, defining desired future conditions, identifying purpose and need, developing and
evaluating alternatives, and monitoring. Although many of the examples offered in this synthesis
involve the Forest Service, the knowledge shared here can be used by communities and citizen
groups as well as agencies at local, State, and Federal levels to improve land use planning and 
management through collaborative action. 
This report is a companion to a managers’ report on social science to improve the development and
implementation of fuels management projects (in process), but it provides more detail on what 
social scientist research has discovered about collaboration. Even more information can be found 
in the studies cited in this synthesis. To help readers locate this information and to identify which
publications might be useful in justifying and supporting efforts for wildland fire collaboration, a 
CD-ROM is enclosed that contains an annotated bibliography of the literature on collaboration 
relevant to wildland fire and fuels management. This is not an exhaustive bibliography, but it is a
good introduction to the abundant scientific literature that addresses collaboration in general, the
more limited scientific literature on collaboration for natural resource management, and the very 
limited scientific literature on collaboration for wildland fire. 
Introduction

Collaboration is not a new idea for public land managers. Surveys of national forest employees in the
mid-1990s found interest and support for implementing a more collaborative approach to interacting
with the public (Mohai et al. 1994, Mohai and Jakes 1996). At the time of these studies, some level of
collaborative planning was reported on 91 percent of the national forests (Selin et al. 1997). 
Wildland fire management offers many examples of interagency collaboration, with agencies discovering 
“that they could develop better and long-lasting solutions for complex resource problems  
by working together [rather] than by attempting to deal with the problems on their own” 
(Pipkin and Doerksen 2000: iii). 
Beyond coordinated response to fires, wildland fire professionals have created common training and
standards; have shared information, equipment, supplies, and personnel; and, more recently, have col-
laborated on research, fuel hazard reduction, and public education. 
One example of wildland fire collaboration at the national level is the National Interagency Fire Center
(NIFC). NIFC was established in 1965 when the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Forest
Service joined forces to improve support for firefighting in the West. The Department of Commerce’s
National Weather Service contributed fire weather forecasting to the NIFC effort, and in the 1970s four
more agencies from the U.S. Department of the Interior—the National Park Service, Bureau of Indian
Affairs (BIA), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Office of Aircraft Services (OAS)—joined NIFC
(Pipkin and Doerksen 2000). 
A second example of wildland fire collaboration at the national level is the National Wildfire Coordinating
Group (NWCG). Created in 1976, the NWCG is made up of members of NIFC and the National Association
of State Foresters. The goal of the NWCG is to coordinate programs of the participating wildland fire manage-
ment agencies to improve efficiency and provide a framework for working together (NWCG 2004). 
There are numerous examples of wildland fire collaboration at the local level. Local volunteer fire
departments share training, equipment, and facilities with partners at the State and Federal level.
Community groups and agencies come together in organizations such as local fire councils to 
collaborate on planning and conducting fuel treatments. Programs such as Firewise, FireFree, and 
Fire Safe bring together diverse partners to encourage and support wildland fire management activities.
Many of these collaborative efforts improve not only the management of wildland fire, but also the
overall health of forests and other components of fire-dependent ecosystems (Sturtevant and Jakes
2003, Teie and Weatherford 2000, USDA 2003).

Collaboration and Wildland Fire

A Synthesis of Research on Collaboration |  3
Although collaboration in wildland fire management has been significant, calls continue for more 
collaboration, especially at the local level. In a joint report by then USDA Secretary Dan Glickman and
Department of the Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt to President Clinton after the fires in the summer of
2000, it was suggested that Federal fuels treatment teams work closely with local communities (USDA
and USDI 2000). Congress, in its appropriation for the National Fire Plan, directed that there should be
“a collaborative structure, with the states and local governments as full partners …. Successful 
implementation of this program will require close collaboration among citizens and governments 
at all levels” (USDA and USDI 2001, p. 5). 
Recognizing that community engagement can make an initiative more enduring, this report ends by
suggesting, “Key decisions should be made at local levels.”
In a report to the NWCG, managers and the public identified critical social science research questions
for wildland fire management (Machlis et al. 2002). The number one question emerging was “How can
Federal agencies best share responsibility for fire management with non-Federal landowners?” A study
by the National Academy for Public Administration points to the added difficulty and costs of fighting
wildland fires due to the growth of the “wildland-human interface,” and suggests that collaborative
efforts are needed for addressing the growing risks of wildland fire (NAPA 2003). 
More recently, a handbook for implementing the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (HFRA) emphasizes
the importance of communities and Federal agencies working together to develop projects to reduce haz-
ardous fuels (Society of American Foresters 2004). As a requirement for funding, communities must develop
community wildfire protection plans that are developed collaboratively with government representatives from
local and State levels, and in consultation with Federal agencies and other interested parties. The HFRA clear-
ly recognizes that wildfire and fuels management is no longer solely the responsibility of Federal agencies, but
is rather a shared responsibility. Collaboration is as crucial as ever in meeting this responsibility.
What follows is a synthesis of published research relating to collaboration and relevant to wildland fire
and fuels management. The synthesis is organized in topics as follows:
• Definition of collaboration
• Benefits of collaboration
• Stages of collaboration
• Challenges for building and sustaining collaboration
• Policy resources for collaboration
• Keys to successful collaboration

Collaboration is the “pooling of appreciations and/or tangible resources, such as information, money,
labor, etc., by two or more stakeholders to solve a set of problems which neither can solve individually”
(Gray 1985, p. 912). Although there are many definitions of collaboration, most collaborative relation-
ships are (1) voluntary, (2) involve face-to-face interaction and interdependence, and (3) seek to achieve
specific goals (Wondolleck and Yaffee 2000). In general, collaboration helps people achieve goals
together that they could not achieve independently (table 1). Some people find that they better 
understand what collaboration is by studying the different types of groups that may be labeled 
collaborative. Readers can find a detailed discussion of the types of collaboration in appendix A. 
Definition of Collaboration
Collaboration is not…
… a goal in and of itself.
… new.
… a silver bullet that will eliminate conflict and controversy. 
… something that can be forced.
… a way of manipulating or co-opting groups or interests.
… a substitute for public involvement.
… an abdication of authority or responsibilities.
… always the best approach.
Collaboration is…
… a means of achieving a goal.
… a process that has been around for centuries.
… one tool to use in project planning and implementation.
… a voluntary, mutually beneficial, desired arrangement. 
… fair and conducted in good faith.
… a complement to public involvement activities.
… a sharing of authority or responsibilities.
… one approach to wildland fire and resource management.
Table 1.—Characteristics of Collaboration (BLM and Sonoran Institute 2000, NWCG 1999, USDA 2000, 
USDI 2000)

Collaboration in forestry and natural resources often focuses on collaborative stewardship.
Collaborative stewardship is defined as: 
• “… voluntary, mutually beneficial, desired arrangement between groups… established to accomplish 
mutual objectives that are consistent with the mission of each group” (NWCG 1999, p. 10).
• “People working together, sharing knowledge and resources to ensure ecological systems and 
communities” (USDA 2000, p. 1).
• “A cooperative process in which interested parties, often with widely varied interests, work together to seek
solutions with broad support for managing public and other lands” (USDI and Sonoran Institute 2000, p. 3).
• “A cooperative process in which interested parties work face-to-face to resolve a natural resource problem,
create a new policy, or develop a management plan” (Cestero 1999, p. 9).

A Synthesis of Research on Collaboration |  5
Why should project managers collaborate? Because a new law requires it? Because a supervisor tells
them they must? As
usual, the best answer
is the simplest:
“Collaboration can
lead to better deci-
sions that are more
likely to be imple-
mented, and at the
same time, better pre-
pare agencies and
communities for
future challenges”
(Wondolleck and Yaffee 2000, p. 23). Below we summarize (table 2) and discuss several benefits of
collaboration for those involved in fuels management.
Collaboration Increases Efficiency
Although the responsibilities of natural resource managers have increased in complexity, budgets to
fulfill many of these responsibilities have diminished and competition for new dollars has intensified
(Pipkin and Doerksen 2000). Even with increased funding for fuels reduction on Federal lands, effi-
ciency is monitored to ensure responsible use of public funds. Collaboration can create agreements
that result in increased efficiency through the sharing of personnel and equipment—means to combine
resources for mutual benefit (Wondolleck and Yaffee 2000). Collaboration also results in relationships
that help agencies and organizations leverage resources by qualifying for grants that provide matching
funds (USDA 2000). Collaboration can increase efficiency by mobilizing citizens who provide volun-
teer labor for projects or help organize and conduct fund-raising activities (Loucks 2002). Greater effi-
ciency is also realized through the sharing of data and analyses. Although collaborating may initially
take more time and funding than not collaborating, research has demonstrated long-term benefits
including increased efficiency and “bang for the buck.” One study reported, “Many respondents noted
that collaboration could improve cost-effectiveness at the organizational and interorganizational level”
(Imperial and Hennessey 2000, p. 18). 
Collaboration Increases Agency Awareness of Changing Values
Social values are changing and becoming more diverse (USDA 2000). Attitudes, values, and beliefs
about wildland fire and fuels management are also in flux. Various groups, aided by the “information
Benefits of Collaboration
Wildland fire or fuels management issues and concerns
Lack of adequate funding for projects and programs
Lack of quality, usable data and other resources
Perceived and real resistance and mistrust
NEPA planning requirements
Incompatible attitudes towards fire
Conflicting project timelines, standards, and objectives
Benefits of collaboration
Collaboration can mobilize people and organizations to 
generate funding.
Collaboration facilitates the sharing of data, expertise, and data. 
Collaboration leads to coalitions and support.
Collaboration can lead to interagency and community technical
teams that facilitate the NEPA process.
Collaboration leads to broader understanding of different 
attitudes and values through outreach and shared learning.
Collaboration can lead to coordination, cooperation, and
increased effectiveness and efficiency.

Concerns (TNC 2003)

highway,” have increased the range of public interest and understanding of resource issues. Through
collaboration—building coalitions, identifying common ground, engaging in collective learning, and
sharing information—public land managers can better identify, understand, and respond to these
changes (USDI 2000). 
Collaboration Builds Trust
It is commonly acknowledged that trust in government, including public land management agencies
responsible for wildland fire and fuels management projects, is not what it could be or has been.
However, when we talk about trust in government, we need to distinguish between trust in the gov-
ernment agency and trust in the individual government employee. Although local residents may dis-
trust the agency, they tend to trust the individual employee (“I trust the Ranger, just not the Forest
Service”). When Federal employees participate in collaborative activities as individuals, trust builds
between members and may eventually include the agency (Sturtevant and Lange 2003). 
Collaboration is part of a movement to counteract special interest politics and cynicism about govern-
ment to “reawaken” (Brick 2001) community with a focus on stewardship. By collectively defining
fuels management as one step to improving forest health, managers—with the community’s support
and understanding—can make the case for being responsible stewards of the land. Indeed, in some
cases, collaboration seems to be the only process that will work (Brick 2001, Kusel and Adler 2003).
Collaboration Facilitates Landscape-level Management and Planning
Managers are looking across ownership boundaries to promote sustainable resource management at
the landscape level (USDA 2000). Although fuels mitigation projects may be planned and implement-
ed at the district or local level, to be effective they must support a broader landscape-level plan for
fuels management. Several case studies of collaborative groups working in
watershed restoration describe the positive results of joint resource management
planning (Born and Genskow 2000, Brunner et al. 2002, Imperial and
Hennessey 2000, Porter and Salvesen 1995). Examples include development of
joint watershed management plans; resource sharing (e.g., expert from one
agency lent to another; interest group collecting data for agency); joint grant
proposals; and, in a few cases, the creation of intergovernmental organizations,
Federal-State compacts, and shared regulations. 
Technical advances support and enhance landscape-level planning across jurisdictional boundaries
(Yaffee and Wondolleck 2000). Collaboration facilitates synthesis of information in a manner that

“adds value” for decisionmakers, enhances project-level efforts (Imperial and Hennessey 2000) and
increases access to information through collaborative-sponsored clearinghouses (Born and Genskow
2000) and forums for discussing technical issues (Steelman and Kunkel 2003). Cooperatives such as
the Southern Sierra Geographic Information Cooperative are working to provide Web sites with soft-
ware and data downloads for coordinated watershed and fire planning (Birkholz and Lineback 2001). 
Collaboration Motivates Private Landowners
One of the major challenges facing those involved in wildland fire and fuels management is motivating
individuals to take responsibility for the necessary activities on their land. Landscape-level forest health
needs such as fuels mitigation demand landscape-level, multi-ownership solutions. Watershed council
projects are often held up as models of projects that work across ownership boundaries and engage
private citizens. Although involvement of private landowners in watershed groups is uneven (Waage
2003), studies of wildland fire and fuels management planning show that collaborative projects have
promoted personal responsibility and motivated landowners to mitigate their own, as well as their

neighbors’, vulnerability to fire (Firewise Communities/USA 2003, Steelman and Kunkel 2003,
Sturtevant and Corson 2003). However, to be motivated individuals must understand the problem
being faced:
Only when the public truly understands the nature of the wildland/urban interface fire 
problem will the community-based coalitions needed to effectively mitigate the problem be
successful (Teie and Weatherford 2000, p. 29). 
Collaboration Supports Science
Scientific “truth” is being debated more publicly and contentiously than at any time during the last cen-
tury. Non-agency scientists have grown in number (USDI 2000); and independent scientists, agency
retirees, and university scientists have entered the “my science, your science” or “dueling scientists” con-
tests. Collaboration among agency, university, and community scientists can facilitate a move to “our sci-
ence” and “civic science,” a “gyroscope” for the conflicting information and values (Lee 1993). A shift is
occurring away from the agency as “expert” toward shared learning and responsibility (BLM and
Sonoran Institute 2000). Residents bring their knowledge and skills to planning, implementation, and
monitoring of projects, as in the participatory mapping project that created GIS data layers for the
Trinity County Fire Safe Council (Everett in press). Application of local knowledge and site-specific
skills can anchor projects in the place, meshing science with local knowledge (Loucks 2002). 
Collaboration Produces Intangible Benefits
Many of the benefits of collaboration are intangible, or what have been called “invisible successes”
(Korfmacher 1998). New attitudes, shared knowledge, support, and working relationships can lead to
new policies and governmental initiatives that reflect the new perspectives gained through partnership
(Moore and Koontz 2003). Other research finds improved job satisfaction and motivation among
agency workers as a result of collaborations breaking down political and bureaucratic barriers between
agencies (Imperial and Hennessey 2000). Agency managers report that the “greater public support for
action” (Born and Genskow 2000) improves their job satisfaction.
Public support broadens the base of political support. Community leaders can advocate for agency
projects and policies, assisting in public outreach and serving as “ambassadors” who take the “reduce
hazardous fuels” message to neighbors (Sturtevant and Jakes 2003). 
Collaboration Builds Community Capacity
Collaborative projects build community capacity, the “ability of residents, community institutions,
organizations, and leadership to meet local needs and expectations” (FEMAT 1993, p. vii-51).

A Synthesis of Research on Collaboration |  9
Collaborative forest planning, ecological restoration, and education projects have brought people
together not only as stewards of public and private land, but also as empowered citizens. As such, citi-
zens may be able to sustain wildfire and fuels management programs into the future on their own,
without constant assistance from Federal land managers. Indeed, case studies of collaboration demon-
strate an increased sense of civic responsibility
and heightened involvement in community
affairs (Kusel and Adler 2001). For instance,
the shared vision, sense of place, and recog-
nized successes of the Applegate Partnership
have translated to other groups in the valley,
creating “social capital” and a proliferation of
community forums for civic action regarding local economic development and reinvestment, land use
zoning, and stewardship of public resources and facilities (Sturtevant and Lange 1995). In turn, this
network of community groups facilitated the Applegate Fire Plan process and its fast track schedule for
completion. Community capacity will be discussed further in the chapter “Challenges for Building and
Sustaining Collaboration.”
Collaboration Builds Agency Capacity
Collaboration can increase the ability of agencies and organizations to meet their missions and goals.
Collaboration allows agencies to expand the scale and complexity of projects, expand technical
expertise, and garner additional support for activities (TNC 2003). Imperial and Hennessey (2000)
found that benefits of collaboration in watershed groups “included doing projects at less cost and
undertaking projects that would not otherwise have occurred or would have taken longer to complete
without collaboration.” 
Although it may be difficult to measure ecological benefits of collaboration, researchers have shown
that watershed collaboratives have developed important education programs and undertaken activities
(constructed sewers, completed habitat restoration projects) that could be expected to improve 
environmental conditions (Imperial and Hennessey 2000). A study of six collaborative watershed 
initiatives in three states showed that collaborative environmental management can result in 
demonstrable environmental progress (Born and Genskow 2000).
When interested agencies and groups participate in collaborative projects, their sense of ownership
makes implementation more likely to succeed. It produces “better outcomes for all of us” (Belden et al.
2001), a message that can appeal to both self and public interest.
Collaborative forest planning, ecological restoration,
and education projects have brought people together
not only as stewards of public and private land, but
also as empowered citizens.

A Summary of the Benefits of Collaboration
We can summarize the benefits of collaboration by looking at what can be gained from the perspec-
tives of agencies, communities, individuals, and society. For agencies, collaboration can improve
(NWCG 1999, USDA 2000, USDI and Sonoran Institute 2000):
1. relationships, understanding, and support among agencies, and between agencies and the public,
2. decisions and the ability to get work done,
3. the planning, assessment, and conducting of projects across boundaries and resources,
4. project effectiveness and efficiency,
5. job satisfaction of employees, and 
6. opportunities for leveraging funding and enhancing institutional capacity.
For communities, collaboration can (Baker and Kusel 2003, Bernard and Young 1997, Cortner and
Moote 1999, Weber 2003):
1. reinforce democratic values and civic culture,
2. build capacity, networks, and relationships, 
3. enhance an ethic of stewardship and collective responsibility,
4. connect natural resources to community needs, and
5. create multistakeholder ownership of process, outcomes, and measures of success.
10 | Social Science to Improve Fuels Management
The benefits of collaboration for fuels management can be illustrated with an example. Environmental-group
appeals and residents’ complacency about the risk of wildland fire presented obstacles for fuel reduction 
projects proposed by the Santa Fe Municipal Watershed Project (Steelman and Kunkel 2003). To build confidence,
a technical advisory group of local scientists was formed to provide third-party review of monitoring and 
management activities. An all-day technical workshop presented by the collaborative group convinced 
skeptical environmentalists of the reality of wildland fire risk in the watershed and soundness of their adaptive
management approach. The group is also sponsoring workshops and outreach with residents about wildland
fire risk and desirability of fuel reduction. 

A Synthesis of Research on Collaboration |  11
For individuals, collaboration can (Firewise Communities USA 2003, President’s Council 1997):
1. advance self-interests,
2. make one’s surrounding neighborhood healthier and safer,
3. increase one’s ability to define problems and craft solutions,
4. provide access to resources (money, equipment, and technology) for fuel reduction, and
5. facilitate learning about fire risk and mitigation possibilities.
For a society interested in sustainable natural resource management and use, collaboration can 
(Duane 1997, Dukes and Firehock 2001, Kenney 1999):
1. produce more environmentally sound and ecologically integrated decisions,
2. bring innovative and longer term solutions, and
3. create environmental gains beyond the minimum standards required by laws or policies.

Outlined below are six dimensions of collaboration usually called “steps” or “stages” (Bentrup 2001,
Moote 2003, Pipkin and Doerksen 2000, Round Tables 1998, Selin and Chavez 1995, Sirmon 2001,
USDI 2000); movement from one to the next is seldom linear. The context of collaboration, including
characteristics of the local geographic community or communities of interest, affects its course.
Antecedents—mandates, incentives, or crises (Selin and Chavez 1995)—will affect the speed and
urgency of movement from one ‘stage’ to another.
Initiation: Identifying the Issue and Context
The first task in developing a collaborative process is identifying the problem that needs to be
addressed. In identifying the issue, collaboration is given an identity that stakeholders can use in deter-
mining and communicating their course of action (Selin and Chavez 1995). Issue identification can be
a delicate matter: residents need to be alerted to the danger of wildland fire, but do not respond well
to scare tactics; local governments are interested in attracting development and shy away from too
many planning regulations. In addition, who defines issues may be as important as what issues are
being defined. Having a broad range of interests and experiences represented in this phase is critical.
Bringing credible information to the issue, such as maps of fire history or scientific information about
fire-dependent ecosystems, may help frame the issue, grounding it in neutral territory. 
Successful collaborations begin with issues that are considered to be urgent by the community, but for
which there is no clear consensus (Sirmon 2001). A sense of crisis, such as wildfire, provides incentive
to cooperate; an outside threat can unify a group otherwise not able to find common ground. From
wildland fire the group may move on to broader issues such as ecosystem health, threatened and
endangered species habitat, or old-growth management. (Sirmon 2001).
Very early in identifying issues and defining context it is important to assess whether the situation is
favorable for a collaborative process. If there is not adequate time and money to initiate the process, if
policies and legal restrictions do not allow collaborative decisions, if experienced third-party neutral
facilitators are not available, and if levels of conflict are not manageable (i.e., parties are not willing to
listen to one another’s views), it will be difficult to get meaningful participation or build trust (Linden
2002, Margerum 1999). 
Coming Together: Gathering Players
Problem identification will help determine how to gather players, leaders, and “integrators” (Pipkin
and Doerksen 2000). The core could be already-cooperating fire agencies—“agencies … that may be
asking the same questions and seeking similar solutions” (NWCG 1999). Interagency fire managers

have been galvanized to collaborate (Pipkin and Doerksen 2000), and their coordinated system of fire
management can serve as a foundation for wider collaboration with the public. To this core could be
added committed citizens, and more partners as the group gains momentum (Sturtevant and Jakes
2003). Agencies are brought into the process for their resources, support, and participation; for exam-
ple, the State’s lead role in cooperating with local fire departments for wildland fire protection (NWCG
1999) would suggest that State departments of forestry or natural resources could join the Federal
agencies in initiating wildland fire collaboration. Groups or organizations as yet outside the process
may bring additional opportunities and challenges. 
Initiating a dialogue about wildfire and fuels management is typically the job of land management
agencies. However, agencies are not always effective at convening a sufficiently large, representative,
and active group of community stakeholders. At this time it might be helpful to bring in a local 
convener, someone widely perceived as fair and respected (Moote 2003), who can help bring people
together. Care should be taken to ensure that conveners have the skills, funding, and time to conduct
the process effectively (Daniels and Walker 2001, Dukes and Firehock 2001, Wondolleck and Yaffee
2000). It may be necessary to seek training for conveners and to educate key participants on 
collaborative techniques (Daniels and Walker 2001).

Trusted community leaders are important partners at the start (Singleton 2002, Wondolleck and Yaffee
2000), and increased communication with public officials may enhance their positive response.
(Lowrie and Greenberg 2001). Local “sparkplugs” concerned by the threat of wildland fire in their
neighborhoods can help launch the effort (Sturtevant and Corson 2003) and connect the planning
process to community networks. Nonprofit and volunteer community groups, an essential part of
those networks, will make a substantial difference (NWCG 1999), providing organizational leadership
and resources (Sturtevant and Lange 1995). As part of this stage, it is essential to have conversations to
clearly define everyone’s roles, responsibilities, and expectations for the process and potential out-
comes. Unclear roles and unrealistic expectations can doom a collaboration. Table 3 includes a list of
potential players in collaborations for wildland fire and fuels management. 
Setting Priorities: Establishing Goals
An early step in developing a collaboration is agreeing on goals so that members clearly understand the
purpose of their involvement (Ingles et al. 1999, Rickenbach and Reed 2002). Goals are created by dis-
covering, and then building, upon the common ground of place or community, or in response to a
shared threat. A written mission, vision, or purpose statement will underscore this common purpose,
values, beliefs, and goals (Selin and Chavez 1995). It can serve as a reference to keep participants
focused during the process, especially when the group is in conflict or considering strategic efforts, and
it can reunite the group when motivation and cohesion wane (Sturtevant and Lange 1995).
Creating a “situation map” gets people not only to define issues and goals, but also to discover how they
are interrelated. The goal is to get all stakeholders involved in the collaboration to think systemically

about the situation rather than focus on linear cause-and-effect relationships (Daniels and Walker 1996,
Yaffee et al. 2004). This process lays important groundwork for later evaluation and monitoring.
Getting Organized: Creating a Collaborative Structure and Process
The group must agree upon a process structure, including meeting times and formats, working groups,
required resources, communication protocols, and other ground rules. A highly trained and experi-
enced facilitator is especially helpful at this stage. The need to reach a broad range of interests should
guide the scheduling of public meetings and designing of other methods of outreach. The group
should decide how to solicit information from concerned citizens, scientists, and managers at both the
local and national levels, thereby supporting a fair representation of broad interests (Blumberg 1999,
Singleton 2002). Protocols on attendance, confidentiality, and representation (identifying responsibility
to share information with and represent the interests of constituents) may be needed (Round Tables
1998). Little considerations can make a big difference, such as where and when to hold meetings so
that rural residents and people who have daytime jobs can conveniently attend.
It is essential to determine the legal requirements that may influence collaborative structure and
process. Although open and visible decisionmaking throughout the course of collaboration is desir-
able (Kenney et al. 2000, Wondolleck and Yaffee 2000), agency representatives must clearly examine
and define sideboards on their role in the collaboration. Missions and laws among fire protection and
land management agencies vary (Hummel and Freet 1999); accordingly, collaborators must work
within the confines of policies separating agency roles and responsibilities (NWCG 1999). Formal
agreements such as a Memorandum of Understanding or Agreement help avoid later, unanticipated
problems by gaining approval for collaborative fire planning and clarifying potential legal issues
(NWCG 1999).
Goals may be more clearly apparent in wildland fire and fuels management and constituency issues
may not be as complex as in other natural resource issues, but process issues—ground rules, task
groups, and roles for participating in public meetings, workshops, and outreach—still must be
addressed. Meeting management and communication among group members between meetings were
found to be critical in one fire planning process (Shaffer and Shipley 2002). Although some collabo-
rations take years, establishing realistic timeframes is important for fire collaboration (NWCG 1999). 
Learning: Sharing Information and Building Relationships
Information sharing is not only gathering data about the issue and developing a common knowledge
base; it is also learning more about one another—exploring participants’ interests and values, and

16 | Social Science to Improve Fuels Management
building trust (USDI 2000). The current fire risk and prevention situation may have already been inde-
pendently analyzed by each member of the collaboration, but the identification of hazardous fuels that
could increase the spread and intensity of a wildland fire across ownership boundaries is best done
collaboratively. An especially important opportunity is to define “values at risk” from wildfire. Citizens
can contribute information about specific values and places they want protected, and work together to
identify hazards and strategies for fuel reduction and community preparedness in their neighborhoods
(Everett in press).
Implementation: Action to Achieve Goals
The ultimate goal of a collaborative partnership is to accomplish something on the ground. It is not
difficult to agree upon the need to reduce wildland fire risk; however, it is more challenging to reach
agreement about how and where to reduce fuels.
Implementation may involve developing a set of management alternatives or creating a restoration or
thinning project reflecting the group’s common vision. This task requires agreement and support by
the collaborating group, communities of interests,
and those in authority. Conflicts may emerge. A
focus on project outcomes helps to mitigate con-
flicting personalities or constituencies
(Wondolleck and Yaffee 1994). 
Outcome issues can be addressed by determining
how the final decision or outcomes will be imple-
mented (Blumberg 1999, Dukes and Firehock
2001) or by maintaining an “outside enforce-
ment” of decisions (Britell 2003). Recordkeeping
and other mechanisms for ensuring accountability
are important for keeping players and the broader
public informed of planned actions (USDI and
Sonoran Institute 2000). 
Funding needs to be secured, along with processes for coordinated implementation across administrative
boundaries. It may be necessary at this juncture to formalize some relationships, creating a contract
between stakeholders to ensure that plans are implemented (Bentrup 2001) and meeting requirements
for receiving grants and other sources of funding.

Reflection: Monitoring and Evaluation
Monitoring and evaluation are two means of determining the effectiveness of both the collaborative
process itself and collaboratively developed projects (Conley and Moote 2003, Dukes and Firehock
2001, Selin et al. 2000, Wondolleck and Yaffee 2000). These terms are often used interchangeably, but
are in fact very different actions. Monitoring refers to the process of gathering data on a process or
project and involves the repeated measurement of variables over time to determine if actions have
caused changes or trends. Evaluation refers to the interpretation of these data and is used to judge the
effectiveness of a
process or program
by comparing it to
specific predeter-
mined standards. 
Monitoring is often
found to be the most
difficult area for
groups to address
adequately, because
they may not recog-
nize early enough the
importance of gathering baseline data or identifying measurable objectives (Bentrup 2001). Monitoring is
important for building accountability and support as well as for determining whether a project is work-
ing. Accountability is a key issue since wildfire and fuels management has become so politically charged.
For example, the Applegate Fire Plan monitors perceptions of both participating agency representatives
and local residents (Sturtevant and Corson 2003), as well as environmental impacts of projects. Because
monitoring is so important to collaboration, a detailed discussion of how to monitor and evaluate 
collaborative partnerships is provided in appendix B.
Final Thoughts on Process
As mentioned above, collaborations go through these stages differently, and participants may find they
are going through a labyrinth rather than an orderly process. Participants’ expectations will need to be
constantly monitored and managed to maintain involvement and support. Outcomes will reflect how
challenges are resolved at each juncture. Because new issues arise and focus may change, the need 
for collaboration must initially be clearly and compellingly defined (Moote 2003). To succeed, it is
important that all parties about to enter into collaboration understand the limitations of the process
A Synthesis of Research on Collaboration |  17
Before entering into a collaborative process, it is important to consider the following 
(London 1995):
• Collaboration is time-consuming and not suitable for problems that require quick and decisive action. 
• Power inequalities among the parties can derail the process. 
• The norms of consensus and joint decisionmaking sometimes require that the common good take 
precedence over the interests of a few. 
• Collaboration works best in small groups—the process can break down in groups that are large. 
• Collaboration is meaningless without power to implement final decisions.

18 | Social Science to Improve Fuels Management
The literature suggests many conditions under which collaboration will not work (Dukes and
Firehook 2001, Kenney 2000, Moote 2003, USDA 2000, USDI 2000, Wondolleck and Yaffee 2000):  
• History of extreme or unresolved conflict among key interests
• Lack of clear or realistic direction or goals
• Collaboration only for instrumental reasons, goals too specific
• Members not willing to make a commitment or compromise
• Key interests or decisionmakers not involved
• Partnership not needed because one entity can achieve goals alone
• Unequal partnership, some stand to benefit more than others
• Too short a deadline or need for immediate resolution
• Lack of resources (including institutional support)
• Financial and time commitments outweigh potential benefits 
• Legal restrictions and too limited a decision space
• Constitutional issues or legal precedents sought
If these conditions do exist, it may be best to consider a process other than collaboration to proceed with 
the project.
(London 1995), and the literature is replete with conditions under which collaboration is not advised
(Dukes and Firehock 2001, Kenney 2000, Moote 2003, USDA 2000, USDI 2000, Wondolleck and
Yaffee 2000). However, by carefully considering the issues and context for collaboration, the barriers
that may arise, and the essential elements of collaboration, wildland fire and fuel management staff 
can initiate powerful collaborations to accomplish their objectives.

A Synthesis of Research on Collaboration |  19
Getting the right people with a diverse array of interests and assets to the table, especially given poten-
tially conflicting motives and goals, can be difficult. It is essential that all feel they have something to
gain in order to invest, share, and compromise. Wildland fire has the advantage of being a common
enemy; fuel reduction is a mutual goal around which players can communicate and establish trust:
“after a while you realize both sides are in something they don’t want to be in and can identify with
each other” (Sturtevant and Corson 2003).
In this section we discuss challenges to collaboration in terms of three collaborative capacities, or capa-
bilities, for collaborative action. These assets or contextual elements can be necessary for individuals,
communities, and agencies to successfully collaborate. The first collaborative capacity we will discuss
is individual participatory capacity—the willingness of people to become involved, communicate
meaningfully, and follow through with actions necessary for successful collaboration. Second is com-
munity capacity—the collective resources and skills within a community that can drive and sustain a
collaboration. And finally, we address institutional capacity—the authorities, culture, or characteristics
of an organization that facilitate collaborative action.
We present this information with a focus on the Forest Service Ranger, Fire Management Officer, or
other staff involved in building collaborative relationships to facilitate wildland fire and fuels manage-
ment. However, anyone can use this information to build capacity in areas they feel are critical to the
success of their project. 
Challenges to Building and Sustaining Participatory Capacity
The “public” nature of Federal public forest lands poses a challenge to collaboration on wildland fire
and fuels management. If people with local knowledge and perspectives, or others interested in the
issues, are not included in the collaborative process, the process may be considered illegitimate, 
resulting in an inability to enact plans due to administrative appeals or legal action (Coggins 1999,
McCloskey 1999, Singleton 2002). Nonparticipants have veto power in that they can enter the 
process late and reverse its movement. This can occur if they enter as participants who cannot support
earlier collaborative visions or consensus agreements (Sturtevant and Lange 1995), if they file appeals
or protests against collaborative projects, or solicit other political pressures to block a decision (Brick 
et al. 2001, Germain et al. 2001, Smith and McDonough 2001, Wondolleck and Yaffee 2000).
There are many reasons why agencies, groups, and individuals may resist collaboration. These reasons
can be found in a common body of literature, often representing an environmental viewpoint
(Blumberg 1999; Blumberg and Knuffke 1998; Brick et al. 2001; Britell 2003; Coggins 1999, 2001;

1999; Kenney 2000; Lowrie and Greenburg 2001; McCloskey 1996, 1999; Southern Utah Wilderness
Alliance 1994; Williams and Ellefson 1996, 1997). 
Reasons for Nonparticipation
A review of the literature mentioned above reveals two broad categories of reasons why individuals and
groups do not participate. Individual stakeholders, such as landowners and community residents, as
well as many interest groups, do not participate because they doubt the effectiveness of their participa-
tion. They may lack the resources to partici-
pate fully, or they may believe there is some-
thing in the collaborative process itself that will
limit the effectiveness of their participation.
People or groups may also refuse to participate
because of a perceived discrepancy between
their or their constituencies’ values or ideology and the goals of the collaboration. Of course, some do
not participate in a collaborative process simply because they were not invited or were unaware of the
process (Rickenbach and Reed 2002, Walker and Daniels 2001). 
We have organized the various reasons for noncollaboration into eight general categories. By under-
standing these concerns, collaborative groups can anticipate and work to overcome some of them.
Lack of resources: Research reports that potential participants share a concern about a lack of time,
dollars, or skills to fully participate in a collaborative process. Federal land managers are concerned
not only about the availability of these resources, but also whether they have the legal resources in
terms of the laws and authorities to collaborate. Local and regional officials may also resist collabora-
tion because they lack these necessary resources (Webler et al. 2003). Citizens’ concerns extend to
practical matters such as being able to afford to take time off from work or pay for a babysitter. They
may also hesitate because they believe they lack the experience to participate or do not understand
technical issues or the collaborative process (Daniels and Walker 2001).
Lack of technical expertise: Challenges of agency-layperson communication are particularly evident when
communication centers on technical or scientific issues. Walker and Daniels (2001) contend that both citizens
and scientists are interested in using the “best available science” when making natural resource management
decisions. However, this may be a difficult task if managers, scientists, and citizens cannot agree on the
meaning of restoration, nature, ecological integrity, or other environmentally related words and concepts.
The “public” nature of Federal public forest lands
poses a challenge to collaboration on wildland
fire and fuels management. 

A Synthesis of Research on Collaboration |  21
According to researchers, most public managers deal with complex, cross-jurisdictional issues, and
therefore must be able to operate in several different interorganizational networks to be effective. No
manager can be expected to be conversant in all of the topics, but increasingly they are expected to be
able to communicate across several disciplines, including law, finance, planning, engineering, and mar-
keting (Arganoff and McGuire 1999, p. 21).
Concerns about process: The collaborative process itself may keep people from participating.
Citizens, environmentalists, and Federal land managers may not participate because they see the 
collaborative process as exclusive or unfair in representation; the collaborative process may be seen 
as not representing public or scientific interests. They also may be uncomfortable with the meeting
setting and methods of communication (Daniels and Walker 2001, Webler et al. 2003). Individuals
involved in collaborative processes may tire from being repeatedly asked to participate in public
involvement, collaboration, or other participatory activities and eventually drop out of all processes
(Diduck and Sinclair 2002).
Literature states that potential participants may be reluctant to become involved in a collaborative
process because they view the process itself as a “show,” believing that the agency supporting the
process has already made a decision and participation will not make an on-the-ground difference
(Britell 2003, Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance 1994). Local officials have also been reported as
expressing concern that involvement will not make a difference (Budd-Falen 1996, Webler et al.
2003). Some see industry interests as having co-opted the process (McCloskey 1996), and others 
question whether there is sufficient scientific backing (Blumberg 1999). They may also see the process
as a way to delay new action or initiatives and maintain the status quo (Coggins 2001). Finally, public
land managers, including those responsible for wildland fire and fuels management, may not be 
comfortable working in a collaborative setting. 
Legal considerations for collaboration: Several different reasons for not participating in collaborative
processes involve perceptions of the roles of laws and regulations. Reference has already been made to
the lack of participation by Federal land managers because they feel that various laws or regulations
actually limit or prevent their participation (Kenney et al. 2000, Rieke 1998). 
Some people think that collaboration, if used to replace current decisionmaking processes, encourages
agency representatives to disobey Federal laws and regulations, weakening Federal statutes and allowing
public officials to abdicate some of their responsibilities (Coggins 2001, Kenney 2000). People with this
perspective also question who will be held accountable for the final decision (Singleton 2002).
“Today’s managing occurs 
routinely at or outside of the
boundaries of the home 
organization … part of the 
routine is dealing with 
outside forces.” 
(Arganoff and McGuire 1999, 
p. 22)

22 | Social Science to Improve Fuels Management
Some may prefer what are perceived as the checks and balances provided by the existing system, par-
ticularly in regards to public participation in decisionmaking. They may also believe that litigation and
appeals based on NEPA mandates and other existing rules and regulations are more efficient and effec-
tive than collaborative processes (Britell 2003, Germain et al. 2001).
Landowners and private citizens offer yet another perspective on collaboration and existing laws and
regulations. They have been reported as fearing that an outcome of collaboration will change the status
quo with regard to property and water rights (Rickenbach 2002). They worry that collaboration might
require divulging natural resource conditions on their private lands, which will result in new or addi-
tional regulations (Waage 2003, Williams and Ellefson 1996, 1997). 
Appeals and veto power: The “public” nature of Federal public forestlands poses another challenge to
collaboration on wildland fire and fuels management—a challenge that combines concerns discussed
above about the process and laws. This is the ability of one person to halt the process. If people with
local knowledge and perspectives, or others interested in the issues, are not included in the collabora-
tive process, the process may be considered illegitimate, and these nonparticipants can then stop proj-
ects or other collaborative action through administrative appeals or legal action (Coggins 1999,
McCloskey 1999). Nonparticipants can have veto power when they enter the process late and reverse
its movement. This can occur if they (1) enter as participants who will not support earlier collaborative
visions or consensus agreements (Sturtevant and Lange 1995), (2) file appeals or protests against col-
laborative projects, (3) solicit other political pressures to block a decision (Brick et al. 2001, Smith and
McDonough 2001). Potential collaboration participants who have knowledge or experience with this
exercise of power may refuse further involvement in collaborative activities for fear of a project-stalling
or project-ending action. 
Concerns about goals: Many contemplating involvement in a collaborative process may be concerned
about whether the process will succeed in achieving individual, agency, or societal goals. Some 
individuals do not participate because they doubt that collaboration will enhance environmental 
protection (Coughlin et al. 1999, Rickenbach and Reed 2002). Local officials concerned about
enhancing environmental protection may not participate because the goals of the collaborative do
not include other vital community interests such as community stability (Lowrie and Greenburg
2001, Webler et al. 2003). Federal land managers concerned about environmental protection may
question whether the collaborative will help them achieve high priority objectives of the agency
(Blumberg and Knuffke 1998). 

A Synthesis of Research on Collaboration |  23
Concerns about trust: Some local officials report resistance to collaboration because citizens do not
trust the agency that is perceived as controlling the process (Lowrie and Greenburg 2001, Webler et al.
2003). Local citizens may have similar concerns about trusting the process or players (Brick and
Cawley 1996, Williams and Ellefson 1997). However, just as a lack of trust can encourage nonpartici-
pation so can the presence of trust. Some report that local citizens and landowners trust the agency to
work alone, or trust others to represent their interests in the collaborative process, so they feel no need
to participate (Diduck and Sinclair 2002, Lange 2001). 
Yet for many, a general philosophy of mistrust pervades, particularly for landowners and environmen-
talists and for some local and regional officials (Brick and Cawley 1996, Coughlin 1999, Lowrie and
Greenburg 2001).
Concerns over constituency support: Local officials may not participate in collaborative processes
because they believe that constituency support is lacking (Lange 2001, Lowrie and Greenburg 2001).
Individuals may also hesitate to participate because, while they are there as representatives of a group,
they lack authority or constituency support to do so. For example, an environmentalist may not feel
able to commit to a course of action for the public or community interest, unlike a representative 
of a company or agency (Dukes and Firehock 2001). They also may believe that someone else is 
representing their stakeholder group or interests (Diduck and Sinclair 2002), even though their views
may differ (Lange 2001). 
Enhancing Participation
Blahna and Yonts-Shepard (1989) reviewed the 
literature and various regulations and identified
five criteria for effective stakeholder participation:
involvement should be conducted early; it should
be maintained throughout the planning process;
input should be representative of all interested 
citizens; agencies should use personal forms of
public involvement rather than “non-personal 
communications,” such as mass public meetings;
and they should maintain a transparent process.
Early participation in the decision-making process
increases satisfaction with the process and outcomes
because these activities promote interactions
One approach to ensuring 
effective stakeholder 
participation in collaborative
groups is taking people to the
field in order to ground their
core values in site-specific fuel

“Community capacity is the
interaction of human capital,
organizational resources, and
social capital existing within a
given community that can be
leveraged to solve collective
problems and improve or 
maintain the well-being of a
given community. It may operate
through informal social 
processes and/or organized
effort.”
(Chaskin 2001)
between the agency and stakeholders (Germain et al. 2001, Ingles et al. 1999, Wondolleck and Yaffee
2000). Explicit discussion of participants’ individual and collective goals in collaboration can help
address trust issues, including concerns about process, decisionmaking authority, and veto power
(Moote and Becker 2004).
Participants attach diverse values and meanings to forest land, many of which are deeply held. These
values and meaning will affect perceptions of wildland fire and fuels management projects. Participant
involvement in a collaborative process is not simply a matter of generating “public acceptance” for
fuels management or other projects, but is a complex negotiation and possible redefinition of core 
values. Fostering active, consistent member participation is an essential capacity for collaboration
because it ensures that a broad diversity of voices, perspectives, values, and meanings have an 
opportunity to be expressed and considered during the decision process. The inability to foster 
active, consistent stakeholder participation can jeopardize even the most scientifically credible fuels
management program.
Challenges for Building and Sustaining Community Capacity
We introduced the concept of community capacity earlier as one of the benefits of collaboration. Here
we discuss how to build and sustain community capacity. Community capacity is the “combined
influence of a community’s commitment, resources and skills that can be deployed to build on 
community strengths and address community problems and opportunities” (Aspen Institute 1996,
Introduction 1). The building blocks of community capacity can be defined as a set of assets 
possessed by individuals, organizations, and institutions within a community (Beaulieu 2002) or as 
a specific set of characteristics or attributes present within a community (Burns and Richard 2002).
Community capacity is an important component to understand because, for wildfire and fuels 
management to be effective over the long term, a community must be able to sustain involvement 
in wildfire and fuels management activities into the future. Federal resources and expertise cannot 
be everywhere all the time; communities need to recognize and embrace their shared responsibility
for wildfire and fuels management.
Successful collaborations build on community capacity. But what if a community appears to have little
capacity? Some look at this question from the perspective that no matter how impoverished, divided,
or broken down a community is, some amount of capacity exists, with the potential for building more
(Aspen Institute 1996, Beaulieu 2002). Building community capacity is a matter of identifying and 
fostering community strengths, and of working with and strengthening areas of weakness.

community capacity ensures that
a collaborative endures.” 
(Cestero 1999, p. 75)

Building Community Capacity
Activities that create and sustain a web of relationships that cross political, economic, and other
boundaries will promote community capacity. These activities might include participation in civic
organizations, volunteer work, Chamber of Commerce activities, or church socials. Strengthening
social capital might also be conceived as
strengthening the settings where informal daily
life takes place, such as libraries, cafes, or com-
munity centers (Oldenburg as cited in London
1995), where trust and relationships can be
built, thereby creating a “civic infrastructure
that lends itself to collaboration.” 
Community capacity building can also take
place through more formal means. Here, it is important to remember that building community capaci-
ty is about increasing the skills and resources not only of individuals, but also of agencies, organiza-
tions, and networks within the community, as well as those outside that affect the community. 
Chaskin (2001) categorize community-building approaches into four different types. One is leadership
development. Fostering collaborative leadership skills is an important form of capacity building that is
mentioned by most sources (Chaskin 2001, University of Kansas 2003). Such workshops may promote
skills and competencies such as multiculturalism or inclusion.
Other categories of capacity-building activities suggested by Chaskin (2001) include “organizational
development, community organizing and fostering collaborative relations between organizations” 
(p. 299). Organizational capacity building focuses on the institutions within the community—creating
new ones, strengthening existing ones, and finding ways to support them. Community organizing 
historically has meant coalition building and working from a grassroots approach. And fostering 
collaborative relations means communicating effectively, sharing a vision, and working together.
A Synthesis of Research on Collaboration |  25
Community capacity is an important component
to understand because, for wildfire and fuels
management to be effective over the long term, a
community must be able to sustain involvement
in wildfire and fuels management activities into
the future.

Indicators of community capacity
How do you know when you’ve succeeded in building community capacity? “Measuring Community
Capacity Building: A Workbook in Progress for Rural Communities” (Aspen Institute 1996) lists eight
outcomes that indicate community capacity building is taking place:
• Expanding, diverse, inclusive citizen participation
• Expanding leadership base
• Strengthened individual skills
• Widely shared understanding and vision
• Strategic community agenda
• Consistent, tangible progress toward goals
• More effective community organizations
• Better resource use by the community
26 | Social Science to Improve Fuels Management
Schindler-Rainman and Lippit (1993, p. 41) offer a set of eight recommendations for building 
community capacity by developing effective collaborative groups:
• Involve community leaders from a wide range of “functional sectors.” (Public safety, recreation, social welfare,
education, health, economic, political, religious, mass media, arts/culture.)
• Find ways to recruit, motivate, and mobilize the young, middle-aged, and elderly; women and men; established
and and informal leadership; advantaged and disadvantaged populations; racial, national, and ethnic 
minorities; handicapped community groups.
• Develop new ways for the polarized, distrustful segments of the community to be included…and therefore to
communicate more openly and frequently and learn new designs and skills for collaboration. 
• Develop methods and situations that demonstrate the value of differences of traditions, ideas, beliefs, needs,
and expectations as a resource.
• Help people learn the skills required to develop collaborative networks and support their effective functioning,
including development and training of internal “change agents.”
• Increase the awareness, sensitivity, and skills of professionals and members to enable them to engage 
underutilized citizen volunteers and groups.
• Develop procedures for linking ad hoc initiators and groups into the ongoing structures, operating traditions
and “continuities” of the community.
• Develop commitment, designs, and mechanisms for followup work on goals, intentions, and plans discussed in
the initial [stages of the collaboration] (p. 41).

It is important to remember that community capacity building, just like col-
laboration, is a process. No two communities, or the individuals and organiza-
tions that make up the community, have the same amount of capacity.
Although capacity building can sometimes progress rapidly, at other times it
can be painstakingly slow and tedious (Beaulieu 2002), and it requires com-
mitment, initiative, direction, and determination (Aspen Institute 1996).
Challenges for Institutional Capacity
Various factors influence whether an agency or organization is able or willing to
take part in the participatory process. There is no shortage of literature faulting
the Forest Service for failing to support collaboration. The Forest Service is aware
of the challenges to collaboration that managers face and has taken steps to address them. In appendix C
the reader will find the recommendations of Chief Bosworth’s Partnership Authorities Workgroup. Below
we discuss eight factors often perceived as limiting the Forest Service’s capacity for collaboration (and that
of some other agencies and organizations). 
Laws and Authorities
The complex array of laws and policies governing Forest Service actions has created confusing, and in
some cases, conflicting guidance on when, where, and how it is appropriate for the agency to collabo-
rate with others. Some managers are understandably reluctant to collaborate for fear of legal repercus-
sions. In addition, some Federal laws deter private entities from collaboration. However, there is one
law almost universally cited as a barrier to collaboration—the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972
(FACA), which is discussed more fully in appendix D. Some policy analysts say that “FACA Fear” and
confusion over the role and responsibilities of Federal land managers have caused managers to be
unusually conservative in their collaborative efforts (Loucks and Kostishack 2001, Wondolleck and
Yaffee 2000). The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (PL 108-148) explicitly addresses this issue
by stating that, “the Federal Advisory Committee Act… shall not apply to the planning process and
recommendation concerning community wildfire protection plans.” (Section 103.b.2)
Fear of invoking the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and Endangered Species 
Act of 1973 (ESA) discourages some private landowners from partnering with Federal agencies on
cross-jurisdictional projects (Loucks and Kostishack 2001), and the Sherman Antitrust Act has been
interpreted by some to mean that private companies cannot collaborate in collective landscape 
planning, and that contracting officers should not work too closely with contractors in stewardship 
contracting (Wondolleck and Yaffee 2000). Similarly, the Freedom of Information Act may discourage

“Inconsistent interpretation of
authorities between regions
gives partners and agency
employees … the impression
that certain partnerships are
only possible in some places.” 
(Loucks and Kostishack 2001, p. 8)

“Frequently, these memorandums,
agreements, cost-shares, and
contracts involve excessive
paperwork, follow-up reports, and
legal language and are often too
difficult to understand. Many
times the agreements themselves
take too long to complete, 
complicate a simple project, cost
too much in salaries to write, 
and in effect scare off our 
collaborators and partners. …
Involving the public in our 
programs and management is
often hampered by excessive
detail and red tape.”

in Wondolleck and Yaffee 
2000, p. 54)
28 | Social Science to Improve Fuels Management
private parties from sharing sensitive information with Federal agencies (Loucks and Kostishack 2001).
The Healthy Forests Restoration Act explicitly addresses some of these concerns by exempting the
development of community wildfire protection plans from both FACA and NEPA. In addition, the
growing number of effective collaborations among public and private landowners and others suggests
that, as with FACA, the laws themselves are less a barrier to collaboration than is fear of Federal 
regulation in general. 
Procedural Delays (Bureaucracy)
The second challenge to building institutional capacity for collaboration is procedural delays. For
example, FACA, NEPA, ESA, and the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA) are said to
limit the agency’s ability to collaborate with the private sector and local government because their com-
plex procedures require large investments of time and money in project planning. “The environmental
laws [of the 1960s and 1970s] spawned thousands of pages of regulations and administrative rules…
These requirements included a stream of predecisional consultations and analyses, often followed by
postdecisional appeals and litigation” (USDA 2002, p. 12). 
Many policy scholars and collaborators say the laws themselves are not the problem—the problem lies
in the delays inherent in their implementation, which are sometimes due to agency regulations but
which also stem from excessive environmental analyses by agency personnel anxious to cover them-
selves in the case of potential appeals and litigation (Loucks and Kostishack 2001, USDA 2002). By the
1990s, Forest Service line officers were “caught in a procedural quagmire” of project planning and
review (USDA 2002, p. 12).
Forest Service appeals, which allow citizens to challenge a line officer’s decision to proceed with a proj-
ect, are said to cause further unnecessary delays. In addition, the ability of any interest to file an appeal
after a decision has been made discourages some groups from collaborating (USDA 2002).
There is some hope for cutting the bureaucratic red tape that can delay fuels management projects in
the passage of new regulations under the Healthy Forests Initiative and implementation of the Health
Forests Restoration Act of 2003. The Act and new regulations provide administrative improvements
that are meant to ensure more timely decisions, greater efficiency, and better projects (U.S. Government
nd). Finally, as noted above, open discussion of potential bureaucratic delays early in the collaborative
process may help collaborators plan on realistic timelines and mitigate frustration down the line when
delays actually occur.

“It is simply unrealistic to expect
an effective network … to be
sustained without substantial
investment by the government 
to provide for program 
management, group coordination,
and cost-sharing for on-the-
ground work.” 
(Curtis et al. 2002, p. 1207)
Funding Issues
Although collaborative resource management is said to reduce management costs by allowing organiza-
tions to pool resources and develop joint management strategies, substantial costs are also associated
with collaborative group processes, most notably extremely large time demands placed on managers
and other collaborators (Arganoff and McGuire 1999, Wondolleck and Yaffee 2000). These funding
issues can become barriers to maintaining institutional capacity for collaboration.
Research on collaborative groups has found that stable, long-term, and flexible funding is closely cor-
related with a group’s effectiveness (Born and Genskow 2000, Wondolleck and Yaffee 2000, Yaffee et al.
1996). The Forest Service is chronically short of funding for collaborative efforts, and what funding is
available is inconsistent (e.g., long turnaround times for grant approval, findings not distributed in a
timely manner, funding limited to one year because of agency budget) (Loucks and Kostishack 2001,
Sustainable Northwest et al. 2002). 
Forest Service budgets are driven by line items, and there are no line items for collaborative efforts—or
even for fundamental agency activities like public involvement and collaborative stewardship (Loucks
and Kostishack 2001). Managers have little flexibility to redirect appropriations, leaving many collabo-
rative partnerships or projects unfunded because they do not fit within the agency’s budgeting struc-
ture (Wondolleck and Yaffee 2000). Another problem is that much of the funding available for collabo-
rative efforts is available only in large amounts; funding needs to be scaled to the needs of rural com-
munities and institutionalized into standing programs (Sustainable Northwest et al. 2002). 
Agency fiscal procedures can also limit collaboration. Many community groups and small nonprofit
organizations report difficulty meeting the funding match required for Forest Service cost-share 
agreements (Baker and Kusel 2003, Loucks and Kostishack 2001). Although the law authorizing 
collaborative cost-share grants does not specify what percentage of the match must be provided by
cooperators, the Forest Service manual instructs agency personnel to negotiate a dollar-for-dollar
match (Baker and Kusel 2003). Furthermore, Forest Service rules generally do not allow managers to
contribute funds to a project before its implementation. Instead, the agency generally reimburses for
work after it is completed (Loucks and Kostishack 2001). But agency partners, especially small rural
governments and organizations, are not likely to be able to carry large project costs. 
Agency History and Culture
For most of the 20th century, the Forest Service operated in a government that believed in the separation
of administration and politics, and left management decisions to agencies, which were staffed by highly

“A lot of this goes against 
my training.” 
(Forest Service silviculturalist
quoted in Wondolleck and 
Yaffee 2000, p. 62)
trained specialists. Agency accountability was achieved through written rules, standard operating proce-
dures, and professional standards, and enforced through a hierarchical system in which decisions and
commands came from a centralized authority in Washington, DC. The Washington Office was account-
able to Congress and the Administration, but for the most part, the agency had autonomous decision-
making authority within its jurisdiction (USDA 2002, Weber 2003, Wondolleck and Yaffee 2000).
In the 1960s and 1970s, as public hearings and comment periods became commonplace and the
courts liberalized their rules governing citizen lawsuits, the concept of agency accountability expanded
to include individuals and interest groups that could demonstrate standing in the courts (Weber
1999). Public comment periods, appeals, and litigation did not encourage collaboration, however;
instead, they led the agency to focus on rigorous recordkeeping to defend its decisions in the face of
thousands of appeals and lawsuits (USDA 2002, Wondolleck and Yaffee 2000). 
Forest managers’ training and organizational history have taught them to be self-reliant and even suspi-
cious of outsider input, leaving many reluctant to collaborate with citizens, interest groups, or even
other government agencies as partners (Loucks and Kostishack 2001). Yet recent trends in American
governance emphasize increased public participation, and the public now expects the agency to engage
in “nonhierarchical, place-based networks in which government, citizens, and organized stakeholders
cooperate and negotiate” land management issues (Weber 1999, p. 456). Collaborators have come to
expect that agency managers will be “accountable” to their group; and to many, accountability has
come to mean “the ability of government to actually deliver on promises” (Weber 1999, p. 459).
The differences between agency and public expectations of collaboration can be profound and can lead
to unfair or inappropriate accusations of uncollaborative behavior. A public perception that collabora-
tion means jointly developing creative management plans conflicts with an agency perception that col-
laboration should be project-specific and not extend to making management decisions (Moote and
Becker 2003). The result of such a scenario may be accusations that Forest Service personnel are indif-
ferent or hostile to collaboration, as when interest groups and individuals report participating in scop-
ing meetings, hearings, and public comment periods only to see the agency make management deci-
sions that they believe went against the expressed interests of the public and the perceived best interest
of the environment (Wondolleck and Yaffee 2000).
As mentioned earlier, although inconsistent expectations of collaboration can present significant
challenges, they can also be overcome by frank and open discussions of what collaboration means to
all parties in the current context.

[who is confused or concerned

that significantly delays or 
damages the credibility of 
such projects.” 
(KenCairn 2000, p. 10)
Internal Communication
Lack of communication within an agency or organization can further impede collaboration. For
example, in the Forest Service, National Forest System staff generally are unaware of existing net-
works of collaboration between State and Private Forestry’s Cooperative Forestry staff and local com-
munities—even when staff from both units are located in the same office (Baker and Kusel 2003,
Frentz et al. 1999). Timber contracting officers and service contracting officers rarely work together,
yet new contracting authorities require an understanding of both sets of procedures (Sustainable
Northwest et al. 2002) 
Line officers’ confusion over authorities has also been attributed to breakdown in communication
along the chain of command from the national to the forest and district level. Policy analysts cite cases
of field staff claiming they do not have the authority to do something, while the Washington Office
simultaneously claims they do (KenCairn 2000, Loucks and Kostishack 2001). The result is agency
staff afraid to use existing authorities for fear they do not apply (Loucks and Kostishack 2001,
Sustainable Northwest et al. 2002). 
Aside from the delays and confusion, poor internal communication also increases the risk that higher
levels in the agency will override or impede a collaborative decision negotiated at the local level, an
action that has seriously undermined some collaborative efforts (KenCairn 2000). Individual forests
have also been known to make decisions or set priorities that are inconsistent with cooperative agree-
ments that have been set at the regional level (Loucks and Kostishack 2001).
Poor internal communication is exacerbated by the agency’s practice of transferring line officers every
few years, because institutional knowledge tends to leave an office with the individual. When key
agency staff who have been participants in collaborative arrangements are transferred, collaborative
groups find they must inform new personnel of existing agreements, or even renegotiate them.
Enthusiasm for a collaborative effort may leave the office along with the individual who championed it
within the agency (KenCairn 2000). One study that tracked 35 collaborative processes over a 3- to 
5-year period found that personnel changes affected 42 percent of the original cases (Wondolleck and
Yaffee 2000). In a few forestry collaboratives, replacement or transfer of key agency personnel caused
the entire effort to fail (Loucks and Kostishack 2001).
To some extent, improving internal communication is an individual responsibility of all agency staff,
but the Forest Service has attempted to provide guidance and mentoring through groups like the
Partnership Task Force, which was chartered in June 2002 “to assist practitioners and partners by

(Thomas 1999, p. 544)
fostering an organizational culture that cultivates and expands partnership capacity and by streamlin-
ing the internal work process of the agency” (Loucks 2002, p. 27).
Interorganizational Cooperation
Historically, Federal agencies have not reached out to local governments to help them implement proj-
ects, but local government participation in environmental management is increasingly being recog-
nized as critical to good outcomes. 
A study of interagency coordination for wildland fire management found that only the firefighting
aspects were well coordinated and recommended that the agencies create more inclusive and more
effective interagency work groups (Fairbanks et al. 2001). Another study suggests that Federal man-
agers should make an effort to engage local governments for three reasons (Webler et al. 2003). First,
local officials are instrumental to ensuring regulations are implemented at the local level. Second, local
officials have unique insights into local needs, concerns, and resources that can be valuable to Federal
managers. Finally, local officials can have a major influence on community support or opposition to
State and Federal policies. 
Research on collaborative resource management groups has found that the more successful are those to
which agencies have dedicated staff time (Imperial and Hennessey 2000). Unfortunately, staff time and
decisionmaking authority are in short supply in Forest Service field offices (Wondolleck and Yaffee
2000). In addition, Forest Service employees who attempt to collaborate and implement innovative
ideas may not be rewarded or recognized for their efforts. The agency’s employee performance evalua-
tion criteria seldom include collaboration or partnership activities; line officers who want to get ahead
in the agency have little incentive to risk spending their time on new collaborative endeavors (Loucks
and Kostishack 2001, Wondolleck and Yaffee 2000). In some cases, risk takers have been actively 
censured for engaging in collaborative activities (KenCairn 2000). 
According to public administration experts, “the most important change in administrative functions
over the last century, in both the public and private sectors, is the dramatic rise in organizational 
interdependence” (Arganoff and McGuire 1999, p.19). To help managers adapt to this new work 
environment, “leading corporations and government agencies” create a “learning environment” based
on “sharing best practices, rewarding successful action and initiative, and working cooperatively to
solve problems. They avoid punitive “scapegoating” and instead focus on enhancing performance and
employee morale” (Fairbanks et al. 2001, p. xxvi).

“Across the United States,
researchers consistently have
found high levels of public 
distrust of federal forest and
rangeland managers, which has
led citizens to become leery 
of participation in agency
ecosystem-based management
programs.”
(Schindler et al. 2002, p. 17)
Lack of Trust and Accountability
Policy scholars say that, for a process to be trusted, it must be legitimate, credible, and fair. By legiti-
mate they mean that a collaborative process and its activities satisfy legal mandates, are sanctioned by
administrative procedure, have the support and commitment of the agency, and recognize other rights
and authorities. By credible they mean that the collaborative process and its activities are grounded in
the best available science and experiential knowledge. By fair they mean that the collaborative process
and its activities are inclusive and representative, that everyone has equal access to information, and
that decisionmaking criteria are mutually agreed on (Committee of Scientists 1999, Wondolleck and
Yaffee 2000).
Managers’ reluctance to collaborate, inconsistent messages to the partners about authorities, and
reversed agency decisions exacerbate a climate of mistrust and escalate the public’s demands for greater
agency accountability to those with whom it collaborates. These issues are not unique to government
agencies; increasingly, sociologists and political scientists studying collaborations are identifying a lack
of accountability—of mechanisms for enforcing group standards and agreements—to be a major prob-
lem (Cigler 1999, Mandell 1999b, Weber 1999). Because of these issues of trust, as well as the reality
that unscrupulous individuals can misuse collaborative processes, researchers suggest that collaborative
efforts should focus “not just on building trust but rather on establishing predictability and reducing
vulnerability” (Mandell 1999b, p. 13).
Research on watershed collaboratives has shown that the more successful groups are those that have
developed mechanisms for monitoring activities and enforcing group decisions, whether through for-
mal agreements or peer pressure (Born and Genskow 2000, Imperial and Hennessey 2001, Margerum
2001). In a study of interagency collaboration, Takahashi and Smutny (2001) found that an “emphasis
on informality within and between agencies … contributed to conflict and miscommunication… [and]
led to a lack of sanctioning when particular organizations engaged in behaviors that were deemed
unacceptable by the other agencies,” such as failure to show up at meetings or provide agreed-upon
services (p. 147).
The policy analysis literature specific to forestry collaboratives resounds with calls for monitoring and
evaluation of collaborative group processes and outcomes as a form of accountability among different
parties (KenCairn 2000, Loucks and Kostishack 2001, Sustainable Northwest et al. 2002, Wondolleck
and Yaffee 2000). In addition to providing a measure of accountability, monitoring and evaluation offer
a mechanism by which the agency can document and learn from prior experiences in collaboration,
reducing the risk that mistakes will be repeated.

Policy Resources for Collaboration
Forest Service wildland fire and fuels management staff can draw on several policies to facilitate and
support collaboration. These policy resources come and go with different initiatives and programs, so
agency staff need to monitor what resources are currently available. 
State and Private Forestry’s Collaborative Forestry staff of the Forest Service has long collaborated with
communities through its Economic Action Programs, Urban and Community Forestry Program, and
Landowner Assistance Programs. Their ability to collaborate with local communities has expanded
with an influx of funds from President Clinton’s National Fire Plan that started in 2000. National forest
line officers and staff too have access to a number of relatively new tools for collaboration, including
new authorities under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act, the Wyden Amendment, the County
Payments Act, stewardship contracting, and other new programs. In addition, the agency has many
mechanisms by which it can partner with tribal, State, and local governments, private businesses, non-
profit organizations, and individuals. Many of the new authorities, as well as innovative new uses for
existing authorities, were developed in collaborative processes.
Healthy Forest Restoration Act
The Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2003 (HFRA) specifically authorizes the Forest Service and the
Bureau of Land Management to plan and conduct hazardous fuels reduction projects on Federal lands
located in the wildand-urban interface or intermix community, or on lands where wildfire would
threaten values in the interface or intermix community. 
Several of the HFRA provisions specifically speak to the value and importance of collaboration, 
especially at the local community level. Section 104(d) states, “In order to encourage meaningful public
participation in the identification and development of authorized
hazardous fuels reduction projects, the Secretary concerned shall
facilitate collaboration among governments and interested persons
during the formulation of each authorized fuels reduction project in
a manner consistent with the Implementation Plan.” Under Title III
of HFRA (Watershed Forestry Assistance), Section 302 instructs the
Secretary of Agriculture to establish a watershed forestry cost-share
program to help fund critical forest stewardship, watershed protection,
and restoration needs. Such projects can specifically be developed
through community-based planning, involvement, and action
through State, local, and nonprofit organizations. Perhaps most 
significantly, the act places priority on restoration and fuels reduction

projects in areas identified by communities themselves in community wildfire protection plans
(CWPP). Treatment areas identified in a collaboratively developed CWPP will receive priority funding
over projects identified by the Federal agencies alone. Finally, HFRA provides for “a multiparty moni-
toring, evaluation, and accountability process” of Forest Service and BLM projects developed under the
act. HFRA sets a new benchmark for collabora-
tion in wildfire and fuels management.
HFRA also addresses concerns about 
bureaucratic delays by authorizing expedited
environmental assessment, administrative
appeals, and legal review fro hazardous fuels reduction projects on Federal land. 
National Fire Plan Authorities
The National Fire Plan (actually a series of government reports and agency strategies) was developed 
in part to address a lack of coordination among Federal, State, and local agencies responsible for 
fire management and suppression. “A key tenet of the National Fire Plan is coordination between 
government agencies at the federal, state, and local levels to develop strategies and carry out 
programs” (Kostishack and Rana 2002, p. 7). To emphasize this goal, Congress directed the Secretary
of Agriculture to work with the Western Governors’ Association to implement the 10-Year
Comprehensive Strategy—A Collaborative Approach for Reducing Wildland Fire Risks to Communities
and the Environment. Several of the objectives articulated in the 10-Year Strategy specifically call for
agency collaboration with communities, including:
• Reduce wildland fire risk to communities and the environment for the long term.
• Promote a collaborative, community-based approach to wildland fire management that recognizes
the importance of making key decisions at the local level.
• Promote community assistance.
• Hold collaboration, priority setting, and accountability as core guiding principles. (Kostishack and
Rana 2002).
Since 2001, annual appropriations funding the National Fire Plan have given Forest Service managers
authority to enter into procurement contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements with local 
nonprofits, Youth Conservation Corps, or small disadvantaged businesses to carry out hazardous 
fuels reduction activities on Federal lands and provide training and monitoring associated with those
activities (Kostishack and Rana 2002). The National Fire Plan also increased funding to the State and
Private Forestry programs.
A Synthesis of Research on Collaboration |  35
HFRA provides for “a multiparty monitoring, 
evaluation, and accountability process” of Forest
Service and BLM projects developed under the act.

Wyden Amendment
Legislation passed in 1998, commonly referred to as the Wyden Amendment (PL105-277), authorizes
Forest Supervisors to enter into collaborative arrangements with other governmental or private entities,
including landowners, to accomplish restoration, protection, and enhancement work on public or 
private lands, as long as that work is of high priority for the agency (USDA 2003b). The Wyden
Amendment also allows the agency to spend appropriated dollars outside of the National Forest
System boundaries (Loucks and Kostishack 2001, Sustainable Northwest et al. 2002, USDA and BLM
2001). This authority is delegated to Forest Supervisors and may be redelegated to District Rangers,
but not to any other position. All appropriated funds are available for use under the Wyden
Amendment, unless there is specific language in the appropriation that prohibits or restricts its use
(USDA 2003b).
County Payments Bill
The purposes of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act of 2000, also
known as the County Payments Bill, are:
1. to stabilize payments in lieu of taxes to counties to help pay for roads and schools, 
2. to provide funding for projects that enhance forest ecosystem health and provide employment
opportunities, and
3. to improve cooperative relationships among Federal land management agencies and those who use
and care about the lands the agencies manage. 
Counties that choose to receive their share of payments to States under a new formula established by
this law are required to use 80 to 85 percent of the funds received on local schools and the county
road program. The remaining 15 to 20 percent must be allocated to projects authorized under Title II
or Title III of the new law. Title II projects either take place on Federal lands or benefit Federal lands.
Title III projects are county projects that may include search and rescue, community service work
camps, easement purchases, forest-related education opportunities, fire prevention and county 
planning, or cost-share for urban community forestry projects.
The County Payments Bill also requires the establishment of Resource Advisory Councils (RACs), 
advisory councils chartered under FACA that recommend projects to the Secretary of Agriculture for
Title II funding and that also may advise counties on Title III projects.

Stewardship Contracting
Stewardship contracting, an authority that first became available through an appropriations bill rider in
1999, was designed to: 
• encourage broad-based community collaboration, 
• give contractors more flexibility, 
• facilitate comprehensive ecosystem management, 
• and help build a new workforce focused on forest health restoration and maintenance activities
(Sustainable Northwest et al. 2002). 
Collaboration is a requirement of every stewardship contract. In addition, the pilot program, which
contracted 84 projects between 1999 and 2002, required multiparty monitoring of all stewardship
contracting projects. Legislation passed in early 2003 extended stewardship contracting authorities—
which include best-value contracting, designation by description/prescription (also known as end-
results or performance-based contracting), multiyear contracts, exchange of goods for services, and
receipt retention—to all lands managed by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. The
new legislation reinforces the directives to collaborate with local and State governments, nonprofit
organizations, and other interested parties; allow contracts with youth groups and small businesses or
microbusinesses; and consider benefits to local communities when awarding contracts. It also removes
the requirement for project-level multiparty monitoring. 
Economic Action Programs
Economic Action Programs, particularly the Rural Community Assistance Program, fund community
capacity building for collaboration (Loucks 2002, Sustainable Northwest et al. 2002). “From the 
perspective of community forestry practitioners
and supporters, [these programs are] some of
the most effective tools communities and the
Forest Service have for working together on
efforts to build community capacity, support

opment of a forest stewardship-based economy” (Baker and Kusel 2003). The State and Private

Forest Land Enhancement Program
Created in the 2002 Farm Bill (Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002), the Forest Land
Enhancement Program (FLEP) is intended “to establish a coordinated and cooperative Federal, State,

and local sustainable forestry program for the establishment, management, maintenance, enhancement,
and restoration of forests on nonindustrial private forest land” (Act). FLEP is a cost-share program that
encourages the long-term sustainability of non-
industrial private forest lands. This program is
implemented through State Foresters in coor-
dination with State forest stewardship coordi-
nating committees and in consultation with
other stakeholders. Congress authorized
mandatory appropriations of $100 million for 5 years, to guarantee that cost-share assistance would 
be available to landowners (Rana 2002). 
Fire Assistance Programs
In addition, appropriations for implementing the National Fire Plan have increased funding for specific
programs that allow State and Private Forestry to partner with or fund State and local fire management
efforts. These include:
• State Fire Assistance (authorizes the USDA Forest Service to cooperate with State Foresters to build
State and local firefighting capacity, support fire hazard mitigation projects in the wildland-urban
interface, and support Firewise workshops for homeowners) 
• Volunteer Fire Assistance (authorizes the USDA Forest Service to cooperate with State Foresters to
fund volunteer fire departments for training, improved communication, and equipment and protec-
tive clothing purchase). 
A new assistance program, the Community and Private Land Fire Assistance Program, was developed
under the National Fire Plan to promote firefighting efficiency at all levels on Federal and non-Federal
lands and to protect communities from wildland fire threats. It also supports multiresource, landscape-
level fire protection on Federal and non-Federal lands. This program is administered by the Forest
Service and implemented through State Foresters in cooperation with Federal, State, and local agencies
(Rana 2002).
Agency Mentors and Models
Managers often overlook the knowledge of people sitting at the next desk or working for the agency
down the road who have been successful in developing collaborative partnerships. These individuals
can be valuable sources of “lessons learned” on collaboration. Some agency personnel and former
employees have developed collaborative stewardship training seminars and workshops (Baker and Kusel
2003). The Contracting Desk Guide is an example of a resource developed by agency contracting staff
38 | Social Science to Improve Fuels Management
FLEP is a cost-share program that encourages 
the long-term sustainability of nonindustrial 
private forest lands.

A Synthesis of Research on Collaboration |  39
to help other contracting officers understand the expanding array of contracting authorities available to
them (USDA 2002). The agency’s recent practice of designating liaisons to multiagency projects and
collaboratives and loaning Federal employees to its collaborators (Loucks and Kostishack 2001) is cre-
ating another pool of agency employees with networking experience.
The National Fire Plan Implementation Team, which works to coordinate fire management efforts
within the agency, and the National Interagency Fire Center, which coordinates the fire and aviation
resources of all relevant Federal agencies and fosters cooperative agreements with State, local, and trib-
al entities, are good examples of internal and external coordination and collaboration and resources
that managers can turn to for assistance (Kostishack and Rana 2002).
Pilot projects and programs that have been testing new collaborative approaches—like the Four
Corners Sustainable Forests Partnership in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah; the Blue
Mountains Demonstration Area in Oregon; and the Collaborative Forest Restoration Program in 
New Mexico—are additional sources of managers with collaboration experience and examples of 
collaboration techniques. Experiments with stewardship contracting in the Blue Mountains
Demonstration Area, for example, resulted in the development of Integrated Resource Contracts, 
now an agency model for stewardship contracting. 

“We have not reached the limits
of collaboration …. We have
just scratched the surface.”

Springdale, Utah, quoted in
Propst and Rosan 1997, p. 8)

Keys to Successful Collaboration
Collaboration is not a panacea or a silver bullet (Pipkin and Doerksen 2000); it is not always effective
or appropriate. From the earlier discussion of barriers to building participatory capacity, the charge to
initiate collaborative associations to support wildland fire and fuels management may appear to be a
“Mission Impossible.” However, lessons can be learned from successful collaborations that can help
overcome these barriers. Some issues can be anticipated and a plan can be developed for addressing
them as they emerge.
Step-by-step guides to successful collaboration cannot suit the specific needs of every situation
(Borrini-Feyerabend 1996), but many lessons are available from others’ experiences. Some are essential
for successful collaborations, others make the process easier, and others have resulted in better ecosys-
tem projects. These essentials come from a number of sources:
• Prescriptions in how-to guides and training manuals for collaboration in the natural resource arena
(BLM and Sonoran Institute 2000, Pipkin and Doerksen 2000, Sirmon 2001, USDA 1995, USDI 2000).
• Articles and case studies by collaboration process participants and facilitators (Daniels et al. 1996,
Round Tables 1998, Shafer and Shipley 2002, USDA 2000).
• Comprehensive assessments by academics and researchers who have analyzed case studies (Leach
and Pelkey 2001, Pipkin and Doerksen 2000, Wondolleck and Yaffee 2000); reviewed collaborative
literature more generally (Mattessich et al. 2000); and questioned participants through mail surveys
(Leach 2002, Paulson and Chamberlin 1998, Schuett et al. 2001, Williams and Ellefson 1996),
interviews (Belden et al. 2001, Brunner et al. 2002, Carr et al. 1998) or during workshops (Loucks
2002, Propst and Rosan 1997). 
The 11 essentials discussed below address many of the barriers to collaborative capacity and empha-
size some of the tasks discussed earlier. 
Focus on Community Context
To support collaborative fuels management across ownership boundaries, people need to understand
that community context matters. The history of collaboration or cooperation in the community shapes
current efforts (Mendez et al. 2003). Contentious, unresolved past conflict will hinder success (Moote
2003); collective past achievements will better position a community to address a common threat such
as wildland fire (Sturtevant and Corson 2003). 
Focus on Resource Stewardship
It is essential to build on the broader issue of resource stewardship. “Collaborative stewardship is most
effective when practiced close to the ground” (USDA 2000, p. 13) and builds on community members’

attachment to place. Collaboratives stay on track and produce results on the land by keeping focus on
a common landscape vision (TNC 2003) and by working toward a set of solutions with measurable
outcomes. “Unless you can work toward the same goal, the process is unlikely to produce results. This
does not mean, however, that each party needs to be motivated by the same reasons to work toward
the goal” (Belden et al. 2001). 
Focusing on resource stewardship creates a strong common bond among participants (Williams and
Ellefson 1997), evoking emotions that can motivate landowners and other interested parties to join
and take an active part in a partnership. The key is to connect these emotions to facts and data that
participants can agree upon (Pipkin and Doerksen 2000), rather than rhetoric that can bog down the
collaboration. Field trips help people connect to the land as well as to each other and move them past
ideology to common attachment to place.
Focus on Appropriate Scale
It is essential to work at a scale appropriate to the community, a scale that evokes shared values, 
collective action, and sense of place—often neighborhoods or subwatersheds within a larger watershed.

collaborations build on the
broader issue of resource 
stewardship.

“The development of trust is
something that takes time, and
it requires openness, honesty,
good communication skills and
patience. … Trust is a matter of
building credibility and 
building relationships...and
demonstrating an attitude of
inclusiveness.”
(Pipkin and Doerksen 2000, p. 16)
Local, small projects work better than larger ones, but need to be broad enough to cover the ecosystem
(Pipkin and Doerksen 2000). Fire managers may relate to watershed boundaries, but public interest
and identity might work better at the neighborhood level (Sturtevant and Jakes 2003). 
Curtis et al. (2002) noted that watershed groups function better at the local (community) scale than
at the larger landscape (bioregional) scale, but others (Kenney 2000) suggested that intermediary 
or “umbrella” groups that work within a larger geographic area (rather than a watershed or 
community scale) can be important for integrating local groups and national groups and 
policymakers. “Umbrella groups may provide funding opportunities, administrative infrastructure,
and general networking opportunities [that local groups] would otherwise not be able to realize”
(Kenney 2000).
When talking about scale both geographic scale and temporal scale are important. Concerning the
temporal scale, Leach et al. (2002) found that it typically “takes 48 months to achieve major milestones
such as formal agreements and implementation of restoration, education, or monitoring projects.” This
correlates well with the observation that collaborative fisheries groups took 3 to 5 years to reach a level
of functionality (White et al. 1994). However, fire planning and fuel reduction projects can move faster
(Sturtevant and Jakes 2003).
Focus on Building Relationships and Trust
It is essential to build relationships that create trust. Being inclusive and valuing diversity is a corner-
stone of developing trust and building credibility with partners (BLM and Sonoran Institute 2000).
Trust takes work, especially for collaborations beginning with little common ground. “Yeah, it requires
trust—you have to trust each other. That trust doesn’t exist when you begin and so that’s why you
want to talk about goals, you take it a piece at a time” (director, State parks and historic sites depart-
ment, cited in Belden et al. 2001, p. 27).
Successful collaboration starts with the middle ground—the small successes people can agree on—
and builds outward. First, it takes the “low-hanging fruit” (Pipkin and Doerksen 2000), starting small
and aiming for improvement (USDA 1995). In fuel reduction projects this would be thinning the
“small stuff” and clearing around driveways, along roadsides, leaving the big trees, and staying out of
contentious areas until trust is built. Also focusing on areas that pose highest risk to communities—
these may not be small scale or around driveways and roadsides, but if everyone can agree that they’re
an imminent threat it builds a lot of good will to work on those right away.

“ … [I] t is necessary for them
to know they do NOT have all
the answers…. The results of
effective leadership are dignity,
self-reliance and respect for the
individuals and communities
involved.”
(USDA 1995)
“The key is to leave the decision-
making process in the hands of
the community, but not the 
decision-making authority.” 
(BLM and Sonoran Institute
2000, p. 7)
Focus on Strong Leadership
It is essential to have strong leadership. The support of high-level, visible agency or community leaders
brings credibility to a collaborative effort, but leaders of collaboration must not fall back on the tradi-
tional hierarchical modes of leadership (Chrislip and Larson 1994). Successful collaborations have
many leaders with diverse styles and skills: strong, energetic, and motivated leaders who have good
communication skills and personal qualities that inspire people (USDA 2000), but also leaders can
moderate and facilitate; are inclusive, humble, informative, listeners (USDI 2000); focus on detail; and
believe in science (Pipkin and Doerksen 1999). Some successful leaders bring entrepreneurial attitudes
(Yaffee and Wondolleck 2000); they are willing to take risks and resolve an impasse in negotiation
quickly. Others are ambassadors who can work with a diverse group of stakeholders. Also, new leaders
emerge during the process (President’s Council on Sustainable Development 1997).
Success is also more likely if individuals in the collaborating group, including agencies, are seen as
leaders in the community (Mattessich et al. 2001). If community leaders, including those with authori-
ty over the issues such as agency managers, are not in the collaboration, they should understand and
support the mission of the group (USDA 2000). 
Focus on Structure and Process
It is essential to pay attention to the structure of the collaboration and the processes used to conduct
business. Successful collaborations are often community-driven (BLM and Sonoran Institute 2000,
Cestero 1999), supported by government agency participation. If agencies initiate the partnership, its
design should not be predetermined. Stakeholders should be given opportunity to create a structure
they believe is fair and inclusive. “The real issue is control of the process—fears of bias based on who
initiates the process can be overcome with good facilitation and process design” (Paulson and
Chamberlin 1998, p. 4).
Decisionmaking is best regarded if it is transparent and open. “The agencies must constantly be above-
board and honest—no behind the scenes deals with any party!” (Schuett et al. 2001, p. 590). Managers
need to be clear early on about their “decision space,” the legal “sideboards” (BLM and Sonoran
Institute 2000)—laws and regulations that guide public land management.
Successful collaborative groups are flexible. Participants recognize that not everyone’s preferences will
be fully met and remain open to different ideas about organization and outcomes (Moote 2003).
Being flexible and adaptable allows the group to deal with changing conditions, unique situations,
and surprises. 
A Synthesis of Research on Collaboration |  43

Successful collaboration requires
a strong public outreach and
communication effort.
There is no perfect size for a collaborative group, (Paulson and Chamberlin 1998). Some think inclu-
siveness should take precedence over cohesion of members, and large groups can be managed through
subcommittees and spokespersons. Paulson and Chamberlin found that many practitioners had suc-
cessfully worked with groups of 30-50, and some with groups of more than 200. Optimal group size
varies with type and purpose of the collaborative process.
Focus on Outreach and Communication
It is essential to build a strong outreach and communication effort. For fire collaboratives, outreach 
to homeowners is essential for implementing fuel reduction projects across the landscape. Others’
experiences may provide some lessons for accomplishing this step successfully. “Get[ting] involved in
the community … helps to build relationships and credibility within the community” (Propst and
Rosan 1997, p. 9). Collaborative planning processes create ties and relationships that are strengthened
and extended through involvement in the community—offering technical assistance, such as home 
fire risk audits, or working with local leaders and officials in their planning process (Sturtevant and
Jakes 2003).

Newsletters and multiagency educational workshops are an important form of outreach, especially if
the message is clear that it is a joint partner-
ship effort. Collaborators can also make use of
opportunities such as festivals, parades, tree
planting parties, county fairs (BLM and
Sonoran Institute 2000), and similar venues to
share their message and hand out information-
al materials such as fire plans. Outreach can be used not only to inform the public, but also to gather
information and bring interested parties on board. 
Focus on Resources
It is essential that important resources be available to the collaboration, including adequate time and
consistent funding to support operations and staff. Sixty percent of studies analyzed in one survey
(Leach and Pelkey 2001) mentioned the importance of funding and effective leaders, facilitators, or
coordinators. Government agencies can be critical players because they are the most likely source of
funding (Paulson and Chamberlin 1998), providing staff and meeting space as well. Nonprofit organi-
zations and NGO’s also provide an important source of funding, facilitation, and leadership (Sturtevant
and Lange 2003, White et al. 1994). 
Focus on Linkages
It is essential that the collaboration build not only on internal support from local agencies and com-
munities, but also on external support and outside linkages. Successful collaborations integrate region-
al and national interests (Cestero 1999), addressing concerns of skeptics who believe local decisions
sacrifice long-term environmental protection. To connect with information and expertise outside the
community, they network with similar community-based groups (Sturtevant and Lange 2003). 
Successful agencies create liaison positions; they rethink traditional job descriptions and new adminis-
trative structures. Fire agencies could create “cooperative positions” with communities, specialists to
work with homeowners. “[The] public doesn’t care who he works for, key is that he deals with people
who perceive that he works for them … accessible to people to get help” (Propst and Rosan 1997). 
Wildland fire prevention collaboratives need support by the States and communities; Federal agencies
do not possess the full range of responsibilities and jurisdictional control to ensure a successful 
collaboration (Pipkin and Doerksen 2000). Linkages among agencies are also necessary to manage
information and standards across boundaries and policies. Agencies have their own systems for 
Collaborative planning processes create ties and
relationships that are strengthened and extended
through involvement in the community.

tours, brag about your 
partnership.”
(TNC 2003, p. 5)
classifying and mapping information, which are often not compatible across the landscape (Pipkin and
Doerksen 2000); successful collaborations have overcome this problem (Everett 2002).
Focus on Adaptive Management
It is essential that learning comes from reflecting on management decisions and actions—monitoring,
reviewing progress, and evaluating the extent to which decisions and actions are accomplishing
goals—then adjusting management activities, as necessary. This needs to be a scientifically sound and
rigorous process—stakes are often high for collaborators. Pipkin and Doerksen (2000) provide a thor-
ough discussion of adaptive management in collaboration, which will be addressed in this synthesis in
appendix B. 
Focus on Successes
It is essential to celebrate successes, even small ones, to maintain group motivation, involvement, and
focus (Rolle 2002). Early on, the successful collaboration finds tangible outcomes to rally behind and
present to others as potential models. Some remind themselves of the intangible outcomes (Carr et al.
1998), such as new relationships and the satisfaction of having their neighborhood prepared for an
emergency.
Successful pilot projects tend to spread (White et al. 1994). A pilot fire project on one property may
appeal to neighbors previously unsupportive of fuel reduction recommended by a collaboration
(Everett 2002). A pilot fuel reduction effort in one watershed can be used as a model for others, as 
can collaboratively produced fire-planning documents.
There are many additional lessons to be learned from groups with experience in building and 
maintaining collaborative processes for wildland fire management. In the following pages we share
success stories from nine groups that work collaboratively to manage fuels in their communities.

The Four Corners Sustainable Forests
Partnership (FCSFP) was created in 1998
when the State Foresters of New Mexico,
Arizona, Utah, and Colorado organized a
diverse group of businesses, organizations, 
and agencies to address forestry concerns in
the region. This group sought congressional
funding to address increasing risks of 
catastrophic fire and insect outbreaks and
declining community capacity to address 
forest restoration and forest management
needs. In 1999, Congress requested funding
for the partnership through State and Private
Forestry’s Economic Action Programs. The
partnership’s five main program areas are 
community-based forest restoration demon-
stration grants; regionwide utilization and
marketing technical assistance; public informa-
tion linking community well-being to ecosys-
tem health; regional education and network-
ing; and a revolving loan fund. 
A number of local partnerships are networked
through this multi-State organization, among
them Catron County Citizens Group and Las
Humanas in New Mexico. Two groups high-
lighted here are the Ruidoso Wildland Urban
Interface Group (RWUIG) in New Mexico and
the Great Flagstaff Forests Partnership (GFFP)
in Arizona.

Fire is no stranger to the Applegate Valley, with its
Mediterranean climate and fire-dependent ecosys-
tem. Its land use includes residential lots, small
woodland and hobby farms, industrial forests,
and public lands; 70 percent of the watershed is
managed by the Forest Service and the Bureau of
Land Management. Fire suppression, logging,
hydraulic mining, and drought have dramatically
changed the composition and structure of the 
forest, much of which consists of overcrowded
young and old stands with high levels of insect
damage. The risk of catastrophic fire is com-
pounded by the ever-increasing number of rural
residential dwellings surrounded by dense, 
continuous vegetation in the forest interface.
The Applegate
Valley straddles two
counties (Jackson
and Josephine), is
within easy reach of
two cities (Medford
and Grants Pass),
and is made up of a
number of small,
unincorporated
communities. A strong attachment to place
unites old-timers, mid-timers, and newcomers, 
as do extensive informal and organizational 
networks. The Applegate Partnership has served
as a place to find common ground and solu-
tions for nearly 10 years and provided the suc-
cessful proposal for National Fire Plan funding,
as well as the leadership and organizational
infrastructure to complete the Applegate Plan 
in 10 months. 
The Applegate Fire Plan was both process and
product. The process was community-driven,
yet 26 Federal, State, and county agencies con-
tributed their staff expertise and support. For
the agencies, the plan solidified a process that
had been going on for decades: gathering infor-
mation, balancing priorities, planning strategies,
and cooperating over property lines, but this
time in dialog and coordination with one anoth-
er and community members. No one really
knew what they were getting into when they
embarked on the planning process; the going
was tougher than they imagined, but all are
proud of the outcomes.
The process included community outreach 
and education through meetings, newsletters,
potlucks, fieldtrips, and demonstration sites.
Agencies with differing missions and cultures 
generated a single set of hazard risk assessment
maps, fuel reduction options, and fire suppression
strategies. These were included in the reference
guide written by a local professional writer,

along with instructions for emergency pre-
paredness and other information, ranging from
lists of forest consultants to public agency 
regulations to where to report a fire. Appraisal
from local fire departments helped over 600
homeowners work on their properties with
National Fire Plan cost-share funds distributed
by the Oregon Department of Forestry. The
Bureau of Land Management and private
landowners have cooperated in thinning across
ownership boundaries, sharing tools such as
the Slashbuster.
Lessons from the Applegate
1. Promote diversity and the strength it pro-
vides. Everyone brings a different piece to
the puzzle.
2. Seek common issues and goals. Shared 
ownership means shared responsibility.
3. Gather an array of leadership skills. You’ll
need a taskmaster, a coordinator, a cheer-
leader, a facilitator, and an ambassador.
4. Work at multiple levels and use multiple
strategies for outreach. Ultimately, get to the
neighborhood level.
5. Build on existing collaborative relationships.
Start with a core group of people with
demonstrated success at working across
boundaries.
6. Keep a deadline for completion. A tight time
frame keeps people at the table.
7. Expect controversy. Although fuel manage-
ment is not as contentious as a timber sale,
some people will be suspicious.
8. Be prepared for lots of work. The investment
is worth it in the long run.

The Central Oregon Partnerships for Wildfire
Risk Reduction Project (COPWRR) is a multi-
stakeholder collaboration dedicated to reducing
wildfire risk in central Oregon through (1)
increasing wildfire fuels treatments in central
Oregon, and (2) stimulating market uses for
small diameter timber. The COPWRR Advisory
Council includes a wide variety of environmen-
tal, forest industry, community development,
tribal, and interagency partners such as the
Deschutes and Ochoco National Forests, the
Prineville BLM, The Confederated Tribes of
Warm Springs, emergency management agen-
cies, State agencies, the Governor’s Economic
Revitalization Team, and Central Oregon Inter-
governmental Council (COIC). In Phase I, the
Advisory Council developed the COPWRR
Strategy Framework, containing 64 recommen-
dations for achieving project goals, including a
menu of potential small diameter products/mar-
kets for the region. Phase II (wrapping up in fall
2004) is focused upon developing stable,
regionally coordinated small diameter supplies
through the Governor Kulongoski-endorsed
Coordinated Resource Offering Protocol (CROP)
initiative. The core goal of Phase III will be to
take the processes and analyses completed in
Phases I and II, and the agreements developed
in the Oregon Solutions process, and direct
them toward implementing private sector and
community-based small diameter biomass 
utilization projects. The COPWRR Project and
Advisory Council also serve as a community-
based “hub” of networking, facilitating, and
communication for wildfire risk reduction 
projects underway in central Oregon. 
One key strategy outlined in the Strategy
Framework is the development of a stable, 
sustainable supply of small diameter material.
The CROP initiative will—through the 
development of a regional supply offering 
protocol—help achieve the necessary 
predictability and stability of supply to enable
businesses to invest in technologies and 
product development. This supply program

proposal is predicated on the principle that
ecosystem, fuel treatment, and community
objectives should drive the volume and charac-
teristics of supply, which would then determine
the characteristics of industrial and technologi-
cal capacity. CROP was presented as a national
benchmark pilot initiative to the USDA Forest
Service National Leadership Team and
Department of the Interior officials in June
2004, in coordination with the Greater Flagstaff
Forest Partnership, the Pinchot Institute for
Conservation, and Mater Engineering, Ltd.
Governor Kulongoski designated the COPWRR
CROP model as an Oregon Solutions initiative
in September 2003. A CROP Initiative Team
was then created, composed of individuals
with a “stake” in ecosystem restoration, com-
munity wildfire risk reduction, and employ-
ment/job creation in central Oregon. The team
will sign a Declaration of Cooperation (DOC)
outlining stakeholder support for the CROP
initiative in the fall of 2004. The DOC is only
the first step toward initiative implementation,
and outlines how public agencies, community
groups and stakeholders, COIC, private indus-
try, and others will execute and monitor the
initiative for years to come.

The Greater Flagstaff Forests Partnership (GFFP)
was formed in 1996, after an extreme wildfire
season focused public attention on poor forest
health and the high risk of catastrophic wildfire
in the ponderosa pine forests surrounding
Flagstaff, Arizona. The partnership’s founding
members included the Forest Service, an envi-
ronmental organization, and a research institute;
as a result, its activities reflect ecological and
research goals as well as a desire to reduce the
wildfire risk. The GFFP's three primary goals are
to (1) restore natural
ecosystem structures,
function, and composi-
tion of ponderosa pine
forests; (2) manage for-
est fuels to reduce the
probability of cata-
strophic fire; and (3)
research, test, develop,
and demonstrate key
ecological, economic, and social dimensions of
restoration efforts.
GFFP partners include 27 environmental,
research, and governmental organizations.
Formally, the partnership is a cooperative 
agreement between the Coconino National
Forest and the Greater Flagstaff Forests
Partnership, Inc., a private, nonprofit 
corporation that serves as a formal advisory
committee to the Forest Service under the
Federal Advisory Committee Act. In addition to
making restoration recommendations to the
Forest Service, the GFFP determines the work
needed to carry out agreed-on restoration efforts
and helps bring financial and human resources
to carry out restoration activities. The Forest
Service retains all responsibility for developing
potential restoration prescriptions, managing
the NEPA process and public involvement on
proposed restoration projects, and administer-
ing all contracts for activities on national forest
land. Activities and partnership administration
are coordinated by a paid staff and the
Coconino National Forest’s Community 
Forestry Liaison.
The GFFP, through its Project Management
Team and Multiparty Monitoring Team, has
tested over 20 different fuels reduction and
restoration prescriptions involving a variety of
mechanical thinning techniques and prescribed
fire; increasingly, these are focused at the landscape
scale. The partnership’s first landscape-scale
project, the Fort Valley Ecosystem Restoration
Project, used several different prescriptions to
treat 5,900 acres in a 9,100-acre analysis area.
The Kachina Village Forest Health Project
includes approximately 12,000 acres, and the

Woody Ridge Project study area includes
approximately 30,000 acres. The partnership
monitors all of its restoration projects, and 
project partners are conducting ecological
research on several of them.
Because restoration and fuels reduction activi-
ties in this region are limited by the lack of 
forest industry, the GFFP’s Utilization and
Economic Team (UET) has funded a small-
diameter wood utilization study, a small log
sawmill site assessment, and a preliminary 
feasibility assessment for a biomass power plant
in northern Arizona. The UET also developed
an Enterprise Development Fund for Small
Diameter Wood Utilization in Greater Flagstaff
to promote greater wood utilization and 
business development related to small diameter
timber resources in the region.
The partnership’s Public Information Team 
maintains ongoing educational efforts that, 
combined with continued wildfire activity 
in the region, have resulted in widespread 
public support for forest treatment, including
prescribed burns. 
The GFFP focuses its efforts on national forest
lands within a 180,000-acre area in and around
the city of Flagstaff. However, it also works to
coordinate Forest Service projects with forest
restoration and fuels reduction efforts on city,
county, State, and private land in the region.
The GFFP worked jointly with the Ponderosa
Fire Advisory Council, a 16-member group 
of emergency and fire prevention agencies 
operating in the greater Flagstaff region, to
develop a Community Wildfire Protection Plan
under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act. 
That plan covers a 940,000-acre area around
Flagstaff and surrounding communities at risk
from catastrophic wildfire.

In 2002, the Biscuit Fire burned over 500,000
acres in southern Oregon and California and
awakened the rural population, putting over
15,000 citizens on evacuation notice. Although
the fire resulted in minimal loss of life and
property loss, the costs of suppressing the fire
(and the long-term recovery efforts) have
exceeded $150 million. This fire helped the
Josephine County Board of County
Commissioners recognize the need to address
the wildfire risk. The commissioners directed
the county to develop a countywide fire plan to
identify and prioritize communities at risk and
hazardous fuels treatment projects, increase
public awareness about wildfire risk, and
strengthen emergency management procedures
during a wildfire.
In 2003, Josephine County contracted with 
the Program for Watershed and Community
Health at the University of Oregon to develop a
fire plan. Integration quickly became the focus
of the plan as the county and core-planning
team recognized the complex set of issues and 
In initiating the Josephine
County Integrated Fire Plan,
planners recognized the need to
bring together diverse partners
to identify and prioritize proj-
ects to reduce fire risk.

stakeholders. Many citizens live in or move to
Josephine County because of the beauty of the
forest and its geographic isolation. With the
rural population making up over 50 percent of
the county’s citizens, the need to address fuels
conditions on private and adjacent public 
lands was paramount. The Josephine County
Integrated Fire Plan (JCIFP) focused on estab-
lishing a collaborative process so that the needs
of rural residents would be heard by land man-
agement agencies. Likewise, the JCIFP has
resulted in opportunities for citizens to learn
more about the public agency goals for fire
planning and fuels reduction through this
process. From the beginning, it was important
to find credible, local organizations to partner
with throughout the county. Rural fire protec-
tion districts, community-based organizations,
and social service agencies provided connec-
tions to diverse residents and helped established
a foundation of trust with community members.
The JCIFP is now a strong partnership among
public agencies, fire districts, community-
based organizations and citizens. Since its
start, the JCIFP has fostered a collaborative
environment between its partners to identify
and prioritize measures in reducing wildfire
risk. The planning process has emphasized a
cooperative approach to identify and reach
common objectives around fire prevention,
education, fuels treatment and other fire-relat-
ed programs. Goals of the JCIFP include col-
laborative decisionmaking, providing opportu-
nities for citizen participation, and implement-
ing landscape-scale fuels treatment projects
across private and public land boundaries. The
JCIFP has also focused on extending resources
and opportunities to low-income and other
special needs citizens in the county (a signifi-
cant percentage of the county’s population at
risk to wildfire.) The primary challenges have
been related to the lack of resources in the fire
districts and community organizations that
would otherwise allow them to be greater par-
ticipants in the planning and implementation
of the JCIFP. JCIFP partners have approached
this challenge by dedicating time and energy
to providing on-site technical assistance to
lower capacity communities.

The Karuk Tribal members, whose ancestral ter-
ritory includes the area of Orleans and Somes
Bar of northern California, were controlling fire
long before the Federal government existed.
One example is a yearly ritual around Offield
Mountain, near present-day Somes Bar, where
the tribe rolled flaming logs down the moun-
tainside during a lull in the rainy season,
spreading low-intensity ground fire through
wide swaths of grasses and understory before
the logs were extinguished in the creeks below.
Outlawing Native burning practices along with
fire suppression has removed a critical ecologi-
cal process and destroyed a central part of this
Native American culture. 
The communities of Orleans and Somes Bar are
in a unique geographical area. Perhaps more
than any other region in California, there is an
opportunity for wildland fire use on a scale large
enough to restore the area’s historic fire regimes.
The large expanses of unsettled forest lands 
surrounding these areas could act as a safety
buffer to mitigate the related environmental and

air quality impacts of such a large program. As
Karuk Tribal members have known since time
immemorial, there now is a realization among
non-Native people that fire cannot be excluded
from the landscape, and is in fact one of the
most powerful land management tools. 
Since May of 2001 the Orleans/Somes Bar Fire
Safe Council (OSB FSC) has been working to
make the mountain communities of Orleans and
Somes Bar, in the Mid Klamath Sub-basin of far
northern California, resilient to uncharacteristi-
cally intense fires that occur with some frequen-
cy. With large tracts of wilderness and fire-prone
national forests surrounding landowners in all
directions, virtually every landowner is in the
wildland-urban interface. The OSB FSC is made
up of residents from the communities and the
Orleans Volunteer Fire Department. Cooperating
agencies include Six Rivers National Forest,
Klamath National Forest, Humboldt County
California Department of Forestry (CDF),
Siskiyou County CDF, National Marine Fisheries
Service, and the U.S. Fish &Wildlife Service. The
Karuk Tribe and OSB FSC are partners; the first
OSB FSC grant was coordinated through the
tribe and the tribe’s fuels reduction crew can
work on public lands.
The Orleans/Somes Bar Fire Safe Council adopt-
ed the philosophy that managing instead of
suppressing fire can provide and foster cultural-
ly significant resources, reintroduce natural fire
regimes while protecting homes, support
wildlife habitat, enhance forest resources,
reduce global air quality impacts, and lower fire
suppression costs. The Karuk Tribe has the phi-
losophy that the management strategy needed is
like managing “into the mirror” (working back-
wards with a widening view). When you look
into a mirror, the first thing you see is yourself.
Then you can widen your view and look past
yourself to see what you need to do to enhance
the ever expanding multitude of resources and
ecological processes. These two philosophies
took form in 2002. In 2002 the OSB FSC,
cleared and set up fuel breaks over 100 strategic
acres, using $154,000 in funding from several
State and Federal agencies. The OSB FSC
employed 20 seasonal workers at wages from
$10 to $16 per hour, logged 850 volunteer
hours, and held monthly meetings for citizens,
environmentalists, and agency representatives to
work out details and disputes. In 2003, thin-
ning was completed on another 200 + acres
around the Ishi Pishi Road, Orleans, and other
private inholdings.

Communities on the slopes of the Sierra Nevada
west of Yosemite National Park have seen fre-
quent large fires causing increasingly serious loss-
es of property and other high-value resources
and, more significantly, loss of firefighters, lives.
In 1999, fire protection and land management
agencies in California’s southern Tuolumne and
northern Mariposa Counties met to identify ways
to mitigate the extreme fire dangers in the region.
Participants represented two Fire Protection
Units of the California Department of Forestry
(CDF), two county fire
departments, two
Resource Conservation
agencies with USDA, the
USDA Forest Service
(Forest Service), USDI
Bureau of Land
Management (BLM), and
the City and County of
San Francisco. They
referred to themselves as
the Southwest Interface
Team, or SWIFT. One of their first self-assigned
tasks was to map 132,000 acres that include key
watersheds providing water and hydroelectric
supply to millions of residents, 10 communities
and residential concentrations, and significant
recreation and forest resources for which all the
members share some protection responsibilities.
The team also outlined a program of work
emphasizing strategic fire defense systems and
pre-fire management planning.
The program of work for strategic fire defense
focuses on completing three high priority 
fuelbreaks. The 2003-2004 SWIFT Program 
of Work (SWIFT 2003) illustrates how team
members fulfill responsibilities for fuelbreak
construction and management in different 
sections of each fuelbreak. For example, in 
the Bandarita Extension of the Ponderosa
Fuelbreak, the Forest Service is responsible for
completing an existing contract for shredding
fuel material. Agency staff are also responsible
for identifying potential and existing helispots
and road maintenance needs. The CDF and
Mariposa County Fire Department are to work
with landowners to determine treatment options
on private property. In the Moccasin Extension, 
the BLM is responsible for determining the need
for a water source, helispots, staging areas, and
safety zones. The CDF, Tuolumne County Fire
Department, and City and County of San
Francisco are responsible for identifying private
landowners, and starting to secure the rights to
cross private lands to accomplish work.
The pre-fire planning work being undertaken
by SWIFT is primarily focused on obtaining

and displaying information that is critical to
maximizing both public and emergency service
personnel safety. In writing the strategic plan,
political and jurisdictional boundaries were
“erased” to develop a plan that meets all local,
county, State, and Federal emergency demands.
SWIFT has worked with the public primarily
through two local Fire Safe Councils. A Student
Conservation Corps team has helped in com-
munity outreach. Public officials, local business-
es, service organizations, residents and property
owners, and other agencies in the area also pro-
vide critical support to the project.
SWIFT has documented some lessons it has
learned over the past 5 years on the process of
collaboration:
1. Identify the project objective and locate the
project area on a map.
2. Identify what agencies should be involved.
3. Select your participants—it’s important to
have field-oriented representatives who 
are able to make appropriate agency-level 
decisions on all matters pertaining to 
accomplishing the project objectives.
4. Develop a team of leaders with a strong
sense of commitment and dedication.
5. Obtain line officer/manager support and
keep them informed.
6. Become a formal organization early in the
process—develop Memorandums of
Understanding, county resolutions, commu-
nication plans; set formal monthly meetings
(with agendas and objectives); and assign a
coordinator.
7. Don’t let political, administrative, or jurisdic-
tional boundaries conflict with meeting the
project objectives.
8. Show results before soliciting public support
and participation.
9. It takes time and effort to be successful—the
right people with the right support can make
it happen.

In a community where in the early 1990s envi-
ronmentalists were hanged in effigy, drivers of
green trucks did not receive waves, and three
sawmills closed due to declining timber har-
vests on public lands, a group of people met
around a table in the back room of the local
bakery to make peace. The table expanded as
people became committed to new relationships
and solutions and found a common goal: to
blend ecological needs of the land with eco-
nomic needs of the community, preserving the
area’s rural way of life for future generations. In
1996 Wallowa Resources
was formed, a nonprofit
group providing leader-
ship to meet these goals;
in 1999 it became one
of the first groups in 
the nation to sign a
Memorandum of
Understanding with 
the USDA Forest
Service committing both
parties “to work cooperatively to demonstrate
new watershed management approaches that
improve and restore the ecosystem health of the
Wallowa-Whitman National Forest.” 
Wallowa Resources believes the future of its
rural community rests on a strong restoration
economy and a new culture of stewardship 
that encourages various interest groups to build
relationships on principles of transparency,
inclusivity, and democracy. The restoration
work of Wallowa Resources’ started with 
small-scale improvements and non-controversial
issues; with each success, projects expanded.
Assessment and monitoring, whose scientific
quality is ensured by external partners, are 
central to these programs. 
Today, working with key agencies and private
citizens, and funded by private foundations and
Federal contracts, Wallowa Resources is making
a difference in the long-term economic and
ecological health of Wallowa County. Community
Smallwood Solutions, a for-profit arm of the
organization, adds value to small diameter logs
with roundwood products, including untreated
Douglas-fir posts and poles for organic vineyards
and habitat enhancement and watershed 
restoration products for Forest Concepts LLC.
With the help of a local log home company and
the Forest Products Laboratory in Wisconsin, they
have built small diameter structures such as the
roundwood kiosk that served as an information
center at the 2002 Winter Olympics.
Past timber management practices and fire
exclusion in Wallowa County have contributed
Working with diverse partners,
Wallowa Resources supports
projects that benefit the local

to the buildup of fuels and crowding out of
early serial species (e.g., ponderosa pine and
western larch). This fuel density, simplification
of stand structure, and shift in species 
composition increase the probability of 
large-fire, insect, and disease disturbances.
Between 1986 and 1996, five catastrophic 
wildfires occurred, compared to two much
smaller events in the previous years. Current
assessments rank the risk of catastrophic fire as
high. Working with diverse partners, Wallowa
Resources helped organize a project to reduce
the risk of catastrophic fire to private property
around Wallowa Lake. This project increased
the skills of local contractors who continue to
provide this service to other private landowners
in the area; a current project involves about 
100 landowners.

In New Mexico, concern over wildfire danger
was keen even before the New Mexico State
Forestry Division listed Ruidosa at the top of the
State’s 20 most vulnerable interface communities
(the USDA Forest Service rated Ruidoso second
in the U.S.). In Ruidoso, local collaboration to
conduct wildfire mitigation over a broad area
might be described as “integrative utilization,”
whereby each partner contributes some compo-
nent—from stump to consumer—to the overall
mechanism of community forestry. The approach
reflects broader regional efforts to organize a
multiparty/agency program to rebuild a commu-
nity-based forest products economy that works
to improve forest health, as well as provide
wildfire protection. Toward this end, Ruidoso
wears “two hats,” says Village Forester, Rick
DeIaco: one for the Ruidoso Community Fire
Management Plan on private and municipal land
within village limits; the other for the “Wildland-
Urban Interface Working Group,” a community-
based partnership working on
the “Eagle Creek Fuels Reduction
Project” upstream on Lincoln
National Forest land in the
town’s watershed. 
Local, county, State, and Federal
governments and agencies make
up the WUI partnership. It has
been funded by National Fire Plan dollars made
available through the Western Wildland Urban
Interface Grants Program. The goal has been to
create a buffer on public and tribal land adjacent
to the village, to lessen crown-fire potential, 
and force fires to the ground before they reach
residential areas. The in-village ordinance aims 
to trim “ladder” fuels that could carry flames 
into the forest canopy. Upstream in the village’s
watershed, more substantial wildfire mitigation
and forest restoration is taking place through the
Eagle Creek Fuels Reduction Project.
Similar activities occur on both projects: the 
village transports homeowners’ green waste (with
grapple-hook trucks) to dumpsters provided by
Sierra Contracting composters. On public land,
another partner, Sherry Barrow Strategies, Inc.,
manufactures the green small-diameter timber
into animal bed shavings. Like Sierra Contracting,
SBS, Inc. is another entrepreneurial achievement
integrating the economic model into a multiparty
partnership effort that uses a variety of public and
private funding.
“The service and outreach program has expanded
far beyond what we expected,” DeIaco said.
“The first year we hauled 20,000 cubic yards
away, last year it was 40,000, and this year we
are expecting 60,000.”
The Ruidoso Wildland Urban
Interface Group not only works
with private landowners, so also
builds partnerships with public
managers who are responsible
for fuels treatment on land 
within the community’s 
watershed.

Although collaborative groups seldom identify themselves according to academic categories, it is useful
to investigate different types of collaboration to illustrate the variety of structures and organizations
that work collaboratively. A discussion of the types of collaboration can also help managers, citizens,
and others identify the role they might play in these groups. Three different approaches to categorizing
collaboratives are discussed below: categorization by the strength of the linkages between members, by
the focus or scale of the projects, and by the membership in the collaborative.
Collaboration Characterized by the Strength of Linkages
Mandell (1999a) described a range of associations between individuals and groups that can be consid-
ered collaborations. For each we offer examples from the wildland fire prevention and fuels mitigation
literature to help illustrate that type.
Informal linkages or interactive contacts between two or more organizations are the most basic type of
collaboration. The Lomakatsi Restoration Project in the Rogue River Basin of Oregon works collabora-
tively with private landowners to create fuel reduction projects that are a “holistic, ecological example
of ‘true restoration’” (Lomakatsi Restoration Project 2002). Some Federal agency staff maintain infor-
mal contact with members of the project, referring local residents hesitant to undertake fuel reduction
to the project because of its “soft touch” management approach (Sturtevant and Corson 2003).
A second type of cooperation is characterized by two or more organizations that coordinate intermit-
tently or adjust their policies to accomplish an objective. An example of this type would be the coop-
eration that exists between the Medford District of the BLM and residents of Jackson County, Oregon.
The district and area residents work together to complete fuels reduction projects on Federal lands
adjacent to private property. BLM also coordinates the use of the slashbuster (a tractor mounted,
mechanical device that shreds woody vegetation), employing it across ownership boundaries to reduce
fuels (Sturtevant and Jakes 2003).
A third type of collaboration is the ad hoc or temporary task force that organizes to accomplish a pur-
pose or purposes. In Bend, Oregon, local, State and Federal fire managers and a community group
formed a task force to convince county officials to allocate funding for a reverse 911 phone system.
This system is used to reach residents during wildland fire emergencies (Sturtevant and Jakes 2003).
A fourth type of collaboration is partnerships that encourage the permanent or regular coordination
between individuals and groups through formal agreements to engage in limited activity to achieve a
purpose or purposes. In Ashland, Oregon, four non-industrial private landowners, the City, Forest

Service, a land trust organization, and a private consulting forester developed the Hamilton Creek
Coordinated Resource Management Plan (CRMP), a nonbinding agreement describing how their
shared watershed should use thinning and fire-safe home construction materials to mitigate fire risk
(Main 1996).
A fifth type of collaboration is coalitions. Coalitions generally have a fairly narrow purpose or scope,
and members take independent actions that are planned sequentially or simultaneously with other
members. In Roslyn, Washington, Forest Service and Washington Department of Natural Resource fire
managers have worked with local schools to develop a Jr. Firewise program, The activities of this pro-
gram culminate with students burning their model houses to evaluate the success of their “defensible
space” (Kruger and Sturtevant 2004).
The final type of collaboration are collaborative
groups. We defined collaboration earlier, but
Mandall’s characterization of a collaborative
group is as collective networks or structures
with a broad mission that is accomplished by members undertaking joint and/or strategically integrat-
ed independent action. The structural arrangement allows the collaborative to take on broad tasks that
reach beyond the abilities or authorities of the independently operating organizations. An example of a
collaborative involved in fuels management is the National Fire Plan Implementation Team (NFPIT) in
Silver City, New Mexico. Composed of many agencies and organizations with differing sets of responsi-
bilities for wildland fire issues, NFPIT is a community-driven effort to develop strategies and projects
such as wildland fire planning, forest restoration, fuels reduction, public outreach, and economic
development (Steelman and Kunkel 2003).
Collaboration Characterized by the Focus or Scale of the Project
Mandell’s (1999a) continuum of collaboration focuses the linkages between members of the collabora-
tive. Cestero (1999) offers an alternative classification scheme based on whether the association is
focused on activities that are (1) place- and project-based or (2) policy-based. 
Place- or project-based collaboratives are initiated by local, volunteer leaders respected by a spectrum
of local residents. Participants are involved as individuals, representing their own interests and 
concerns rather than their specific constituencies or interest groups. Many of these groups use 
consensus-building, dialog, and collaborative learning to build relationships and trust and to foster
stewardship. They provide forums for the geographic community to share knowledge and values on
A discussion of the types of collaboration can also
help managers, citizens, and others identify the 
role they might play in these groups.

66 | Social Science to Improve Fuels Management
land management issues, and undertake projects across boundaries. Place- or project-based collabora-
tives are perceived as producing more civil dialog and resulting in on-the-ground conservation benefits
(Cestero 1999). Groups such as local Firewise committees are examples of place-based initiatives. 
Policy-based collaboratives are generally focused on regional or national resource policy issues. They
are often made up of associations with a strong stake in the outcome of the decisions and therefore are
generally less inclusive of local leaders and residents (Cestero 1999). Because of their policy focus, this
type of collaborative produces fewer on-the ground benefits. The Western Governors’ Association is an
example of a policy-based collaborative that focuses on wildfire issues at the regional level.
Collaboration Characterized by Membership
Collaboration has also been classified according to member composition: citizen-based, agency-based,
and mixed partnerships (Moore and Koontz 2003). In addition to any on-the-ground projects, citizen-
based groups often engage in activities such as lobbying and petitioning. They often report their
accomplishments as increased public awareness and policy influence (Moore and Koontz 2003). Local
Fire Safe Councils and the many watershed conservation groups would be examples of citizen-based
collaboratives.
Mixed and agency-based groups are more focused on planning, building relationships, and problem
solving. For accomplishments they tend to report the development of management plans, group 
development and sustainability, and increased public awareness (Moore and Koontz 2003). An example
of a mixed collaborative group would be the SouthWest InterFace Team (SWIFT) in central California.
In this collaborative, Federal, State, county, and city agencies, conservation groups, and Fire Safe
Councils come together to implement projects that will mitigate the extreme wildfire problems in the
area (SWIFT 2003). NIFC would be a classic example of an agency-based collaborative.

Why Evaluate Collaboration?
In 2001, the National Academy of Public Administration called for increased program evaluation to
“support strategic planning and performance management for [coordinated fire management] and to
evaluate the efficiency, effectiveness, and efficacy of Fire Policy and National Fire Plan activities”
(Fairbanks et al. 2001, p. xxvii).
Well-designed monitoring and evaluation provides a means for determining how effective collaboration
has been. Naturally, collaborative group efforts will be treated seriously only if they prove themselves
to work (Provan and Milward 2001). Monitoring and evaluation gives the collaborative group an
opportunity to assess its effectiveness and improve its accountability—which in turn can improve trust
both among collaborative group participants and those outside of the process. Participants, community
members, academics, policymakers, facilitators, critics, agencies, and those who provide funding all
have an interest in the outcome of the collaborative group effort (Conley and Moote 2003). 
From the perspective of those who are considering engaging in collaboration, the two main reasons for
monitoring and evaluating the effort may be time and money. Through the monitoring and evaluation
process, those involved in the collaborative
group will better understand if their invest-
ment of energy results in a positive product
and can determine if their efforts need to be
refined to efficiently meet the group’s objec-
tives. Nonparticipants may be more likely to
contribute if they see that their time will bene-
fit their community (Susskind et al. 1999).
Furthermore, evaluation provides funders with an explanation of the risks associated with donating
money to the collaborative effort (Leach et al. 2002). 
Who Should Evaluate?
Determining who will perform the monitoring and evaluation may be constrained by time, money, and
participant expertise. Many groups favor self-evaluation. However, to ensure good sampling design and
reduce bias, it has been advised that collaborative groups hire a trained researcher or evaluator from a
university, consulting firm, or government agency. When the primary goal is to evaluate the group itself,
collaborative groups should also consider hiring an evaluator that is not involved with the group or

connected to the issue (Susskind et al. 1999). This may be difficult for groups who are constrained by
funding; however, in a study performed by the GAO (2003), where five Federal agencies were assessed
for the capacity to perform evaluations, results indicated that creative methods for leveraging funds 
are available. 
How to Evaluate?
Five important guidelines should be considered when designing a monitoring or evaluation protocol
(GAO 1991): 
• Ask the right questions, 
• State the question in the right way, 
• Focus on the group’s objectives (short term and long term), 
• Design the evaluation appropriately (e.g., do not use an extensively long evaluation for a small
group or simple problem), and 
• Consider the specific constraints as related to executing the evaluation (e.g., time, cost, staff expert-
ise, location, and facilities). 
Depending on the goals, the monitoring or evaluation questions asked may address implementation
(did the group do what it said it would do?), effectiveness (did the group achieve its goals?), or valida-
tion (did the actions taken have the expected outcomes?) (Ecological Restoration Institute et al. 2003).
When asking participants or outside observers to assess a process or its outcomes, evaluators should
consider using a combination of descriptive, normative, and impact questions. Questions of a descrip-
tive nature measure what people think and
how they feel about the group’s process or out-
come. Normative questions focus on “what
should have been,” instead of “what was.”
Impact questions address the observed out-
comes of the process (GAO 1991). All of these
types of questions can be implemented
through a variety of evaluation designs, including sample surveys, case studies, field experiments, and
use of existing data (GAO 1991). 
Survey and Sampling Design
Provan and Milward (2001) recommended evaluating a collaborative effort from three different 
perspectives to determine how it has affected (1) the environment and the community, (2) the 
collaborative group itself, and (3) the organizations that are participating in the effort. Based on their
All of these types of questions can be implemented
through a variety of evaluation designs, including
sample surveys, case studies, field experiments,
and use of existing data.

survey of 770 participants from 44 different collaborative watershed groups, Leach et al. (2002)
warned that it is important to get a good cross section of respondents, including nonparticipants as
well as participants. In their study, group coordinators tended to report higher rates of success and
participants tended to be more polarized (either more positive or more negative) than nonparticipants.
Baseline Data
It can be difficult to make claims beyond the very concrete accomplishments of a project. Yet, to justify
the project—and to receive public and private support—collaborative groups often need to show some
degree of causality, or illustrate the project caused the changes being measured. Unless good baseline
data have been collected and clear information has been recorded on the results of the project, using
accurately measured variables in the same manner during the course of the project, it is difficult to
defend a project or management practice or give reasons why an effort should be expanded (Ecological
Restoration Institute et al. 2003).
Timing
Monitoring and evaluation should be conducted throughout the course of the collaborative effort to
determine whether progress is being made toward the group’s original goal. This allows the group to
evaluate the effectiveness of its methods and adjust them if necessary. Measurements taken some time
after the project has been implemented allow assessment of longer term effects.
What to Measure?
There is no standard set of criteria and indicators for monitoring a project or evaluating its effective-
ness. The collaborative group’s interests, the type of effort being assessed, and the values of those con-
ducting the assessment will all play a role in determining what to measure (Conley and Moote 2003).
Some research suggests that evaluating a collaborative group’s process (e.g., communication mecha-
nisms, ability to reach decisions) is most useful (e.g., Buckle and Buckle-Thomas 1986). However, in
terms of collaborative resource management, there is an increased focus on evaluating outcomes
(Kenney 2000, Leach et al. 2002). Most researchers recommend evaluating a collaborative group’s
efforts against its stated goals, although some may also want to determine whether the fears or 
expectations of participants or observers have been realized. 
Improved environmental outcomes are typically the primary goal for many participants in, and
observers of, collaborative conservation groups. Determining environmental changes resulting from
group decisions and activities is difficult, however, because it requires good baseline data and careful

elimination of external causal factors (e.g., climate change, flood event). Furthermore, environmental
impacts may not be evident for several years after a management action has been implemented.
Because of these challenges, researchers frequently use intermediate indicators, such as numbers of
restoration projects implemented or changed management practices, to evaluate environmental out-
comes (Born and Genskow 2000, Imperial and Hennessey 2000, Leach et al. 2002). Evaluators should
acknowledge the limitations of intermediate indicators, however: the fact that a restoration project was
implemented does not necessarily mean that it will result in the desired effects on the environment.
Good intermediate indicators are those that evaluators and stakeholders agree are expected to result in
desired outcomes.
Kenney (2000) outlined broad indicators of both process and outcome success that may be applicable
to many collaborative groups: 
• Improved health to the natural resource, 
• Improved trust between stakeholders and partners, 
• Increased communication between parties, 
• Expansion of the decisionmaking capacity, 
• Implementation of new decisionmaking processes, and 
• Implementation of new management and planning processes. 
In a document evaluating progress of the Applegate Partnership, Rolle (2002) addressed three main
questions that have benefited this collaborative group:
• How well does the group meet its own mission? 
• Did the group achieve the desired outcome? 
• Has there been appreciable movement toward meeting the desired results? 
Once the group has identified the questions it wants to answer, it must select one or more specific
indicators that can be used to measure change in that area. An indicator is a unit of information meas-
ured over time that documents changes in a specific condition. A good indicator meets the criteria of
being measurable, precise, consistent, and sensitive. When selecting indicators, multiparty monitoring
groups will want to ask themselves whether a proposed indicator is:
• Relevant for the site and treatment,
• Sensitive enough to detect change within a specific timeframe,
• Defensible and not subject to individual or organized bias, and
• Able to be measured by methods that are professionally accepted and understood (Ecological
Restoration Institute et al. 2003).

A Synthesis of Research on Collaboration |  71
For example, if a group has decided that one of its goals is to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildland
fire, it may select percent tree canopy closure
as an indicator. Or, if the group has chosen to
monitor quality of life in the community, it
may select employment conditions in restora-
tion-related industries as the indicator, which
might be measured in terms of average wages
in restoration-related jobs or by the number of restoration workers who receive health benefits from
their employer (Ecological Restoration Institute et al. 2003). 
Improved environmental outcomes are typically 
the primary goal for many participants in, and
observers of, collaborative conservation groups.

The Forest Service Manual contains a number of mechanisms for collaborating with other agencies,
businesses, nonprofit groups, and communities (Loucks 2002). These include: 
• Challenge Cost-Share Agreements (FSM 1587.12) 
• Collection Agreements (FSM 1584) 
• Cooperative Agreements (FSM 1581) 
• Cooperative Fires Protection Agreements (FSM 1582) 
• Cooperative Law Enforcement Agreements (FSM 1582) 
• Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (FSM 1587.14)
• Cooperative Forest Road Agreements (FSM 1582)
• Grants (FSM 1582)
• Interagency and Intra-agency Agreements (FSM 1585)
• Memoranda of Understanding (FSM 1586) 
• Letters of Intent (FSM 1586)
• Participating Agreements (FSM 1587.11)
• Joint Venture Agreements (FSM 1587.13)
• Cost-Reimbursable Agreements (FSM 1587.13)

A Synthesis of Research on Collaboration |  73
FACA was originally created to (1) reduce what was considered to be an excessive number of com-
mittees advising Federal agencies and (2) reduce bias within advisory committees by requiring
them to be open and broadly representative. Unanticipated results of the act have emerged in its
implementation.
Advisory committees regulated by FACA must be chartered, and their charter must include details
such as the group’s scope, a description of duties, and the estimated number and frequency of
meetings (Norris-York 1996). The chartering
process can take several months, and a char-
ter will be approved only if the advisory
committee is “essential to the conduct of
agency business and in the public interest”
and has “fairly balanced membership” (NRLC
1998). U.S. Department of Agriculture regu-
lations interpreting FACA add other steps to the chartering process, making it even more laborious
and time-consuming (USDA 2000). Once chartered, notice of all committee meetings must be 
published 15 days in advance in the Federal Register, including time, date, place, and agenda.
Public access to Federal advisory committee meetings is mandatory and detailed minutes must be
kept (Norris-York 1996). In addition, a designated Federal employee must attend each meeting
(NRLC 2000). 
The most problematic are ambiguous terms in the act that make it unclear when FACA applies and
when it does not, and onerous administrative requirements for creating and maintaining advisory com-
mittees when the act does apply (Norris-York 1996, NRLC 2000, USDA 2000). 
FACA’s procedural requirements apply to advisory committees “established by” or “utilized by” a
Federal agency to obtain advice or recommendations. Legal experts generally agree that FACA applies
to advisory committees established by: 
1. Federal statute or reorganization plan, 
2. the President, and 
3. Federal agencies. 
It is also clear that certain groups are explicitly excluded from FACA, including those made up solely
of government officials (Federal, tribal, State, or local), recovery plan teams authorized under the
Appendix D—The Federal Advisory Committee 
Act (FACA)
U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations 
interpreting FACA add other steps to the chartering
process, making it even more laborious and 
time-consuming (USDA 2000).

Endangered Species Act, and civic groups that provide public services to FACA-chartered committees
(Loucks and Kostishack 2001, NRLC 2000, USDA 2000). 
Disputes arise, however, over the term “utilized by” a Federal agency, and this term has sometimes
been interpreted to apply to community-based and collaborative associations. According to analysis
conducted by the Natural Resources Law Center in the late 1990s, “there are three requirements that
must be satisfied in order for a ‘utilized’ advisory committee to come within the mandates of FACA: 
1. there must be a committee, 
2. the committee must formulate advice by consensus, and 
3. the committee’s advice must be ‘utilized’ by a federal agency” (NRLC 2000).
New regulations created by the General Services Administration in 2001 further clarify that FACA
requirements do not apply to groups whose members are not actually managed or controlled by the
executive branch, who provide individual advice, or who exchange facts or information, but not advice
(USDA 2002).

A Synthesis of Research on Collaboration |  75
The courts have interpreted the phrase “utilized by” even more narrowly, limiting FACA to groups
“organized by, or closely tied to, the Federal Government, and thus enjoying quasi-public status” and
stating that agency membership in an advisory group is not sufficient to trigger FACA (NRLC 2000).
Based on the case law, some legal scholars have concluded that most community-based and collabora-
tive groups are not subject to FACA (NRLC 2000). Others, however, including some agency lawyers,
disagree (Loucks and Kostishack 2001).
Ongoing debates and confusion about FACA have led some Forest Service personnel to believe that
FACA forbids them from meeting regularly with any group that does not have a FACA charter and
from seeking advice from any nongovernmental group (Loucks and Kostishack 2002, USDA 2000).
This “FACA Fear” also stems from the threat that interest groups will use FACA lawsuits to stop gov-
ernment action they oppose for other reasons (Loucks and Kostishack 2001). Although an agency
would clearly be violating Federal law if it gave a collaborative group decisionmaking authority over
Federal lands management (Coggins 1999), many outside the agency believe that it is overly cautious
on this issue: 
At times, the agency’s interpretation of FACA is so strict as to lead partners to
believe that it is being used by Federal agencies to thwart collaborative activities that
they wish to avoid for other reasons (Loucks and Kostishack 2001, p. 8).
The Forest Service has asked its Collaboration Team to develop language clarifying this issue. In the
meantime, NRLC (2000) advises that collaborative groups structure their meetings around one of the
exemptions in the act itself, for example, specifically structuring meetings so that only information and
not advice is exchanged. Section 102 of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act states that “the Federal
Advisory Committee Act … shall not apply to the planning process and recommendations concerning
community wildfire protection plans.”
