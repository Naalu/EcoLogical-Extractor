Working Papers in Southwestern Ponderosa Pine Forest Restoration
Ecological restoration seeks to heal degraded ecosystems by reestablishing native species, structural
characteristics, and ecological processes. The Society for Ecological Restoration International
defines restoration as “an intentional activity that initiates or accelerates the recovery of an
ecosystem with respect to its health, integrity and sustainability. . . . Restoration attempts to return
an ecosystem to its historic trajectory” (Society for Ecological Restoration International 2004).
In the southwestern United States, most ponderosa pine forests have been degraded during the last
150 years; many areas are now dominated by dense thickets of small trees and have lost their once
diverse understory. Forests in this condition are highly susceptible to damaging, stand-replacing
fires and increased insect and disease epidemics. Restoration of these forests centers on
reintroducing frequent, low-intensity surface fires—often after first thinning dense stands—and
reestablishing productive understory plant communities. The Ecological Restoration Institute at
Northern Arizona University is a pioneer in researching, implementing, and monitoring ecological
restoration of southwestern ponderosa pine forests. By allowing natural processes such as fire to
resume self-sustaining patterns, we hope to reestablish healthy forests that provide ecosystem
services, wildlife habitat, and recreational opportunities.
Every restoration project needs to be site specific, but the detailed experience of field practitioners
may help guide practitioners elsewhere. The Working Papers series presents findings and
management recommendations from research and observations by the ERI and its partner
organizations.

Integrating Forest Restoration Treatments with Mexican Spotted Owl Habitat Needs
Executive Summary
Management of the federally threatened Mexican spotted owl (MSO; Strix occidentalis lucida) has
been a major concern, both technical and political, for forest managers in the southwestern United
States. So has the need to reduce the risk of stand-replacing wildfire in the region’s ponderosa pine
forests. Managers have generally shied away from linking these two concerns, fearing that the
consultation required under the federal Endangered Species Act makes forest restoration treatments
in or adjacent to MSO habitat too cumbersome.
Yet carefully planned and implemented restoration treatments either around or in MSO habitat are
crucial to the species’ future survival, and can be accomplished. They can be designed to maximize
benefits to forest health while minimizing negative impacts to—and in some cases actively
benefiting—the MSO and/or its habitat. There will never be 100 percent agreement between
reducing fire risk and maintaining or enhancing MSO habitat needs, but the goal of this publication
is to find the areas of common ground between these two important management priorities within
southwestern forests.
Species Status
• MSOs occur in the southwestern states in disjunct forested mountain systems, moist canyons,
and in some areas in steep, rocky canyonlands.
• In forested habitats, MSOs tend to prefer areas of fairly dense forest with high canopy cover.
• In the past MSOs likely lived in patches of suitable habitat set in a matrix of more open
ponderosa pine forests.
• The MSO is a federally listed threatened species, and managers are legally mandated to consider
its needs in management actions.
• Managers have often shied away from restoration treatments in or near MSO habitat because of
perceived legal and bureaucratic hurdles.
• Monitoring has been insufficient to accurately determine MSO population trends.
• Research shows that MSO recruitment levels vary a great deal, and as a result the species is
vulnerable to factors that increase adult mortality.
• High-severity wildfire is one of the primary threats to the MSO.
• Effects of fire on MSOs can be mixed, and can range from outright habitat destruction to
increases in prey base.
Recommendations
• It is important to consider fuel reduction and restoration treatments both in MSO habitat—
usually pine-oak or mixed conifer stands—and in the surrounding ponderosa pine forest
matrix.
• Managers can conduct restoration treatments in much MSO habitat according to criteria
established in the MSO Recovery Plan.
• Such treatments are necessary in order to protect MSO habitat and other areas from severe fire
and to improve forest health, and they can be accomplished through careful planning.
• Managers should conduct restoration treatments in ponderosa pine forests around MSO habitat
in order to protect those habitats, reduce the risk of large-scale wildfire, and increase forest
health.

Management of the federally threatened Mexican spotted owl
(MSO; Strix occidentalis lucida) has been a major concern,
both technical and political, for forest managers in the
southwestern United States. So has the need to reduce the risk
of stand-replacing wildfire in the region’s ponderosa pine
forests. Managers have generally shied away from linking
these two concerns, fearing that the consultation required
under the federal Endangered Species Act makes forest
restoration treatments in or adjacent to MSO habitat too
cumbersome.
Yet carefully planned and implemented restoration treatments
either around or in MSO habitat are crucial to the species’
future survival, and can be accomplished. They can be
designed to maximize benefits to forest health while
minimizing negative impacts to—and in some cases actively
benefiting—the MSO and/or its habitat. There will never be
100 percent agreement between reducing fire risk and
maintaining or enhancing MSO habitat needs, but the goal of
this publication is to find the areas of common ground
between these two important management priorities within
southwestern forests.
Mexican Spotted Owl Biology
Key Points
•
MSOs occur in the southwestern states in disjunct
forested mountain systems, moist canyons, and in
some areas in steep, rocky canyonlands.
•
In forested habitats, MSOs tend to prefer areas of
fairly dense forest with high canopy cover.
Because of its close association with commercially valuable
forests in western North America, the spotted owl is one of
the most studied birds in the world (Gutiérrez et al. 1995).
The Mexican spotted owl is one of three recognized
subspecies. It is separated geographically from both the
northern and California spotted owls of the west coast and
has been genetically isolated from them for thousands of
years (Barrowclough et al. 1999).
The MSO occupies a broad range in the southwestern United
States (Figure 1), but it does not occur uniformly within this
area. Instead, it occurs in disjunct forested mountain systems,
moist canyons, and in some cases in steep, rocky canyonlands.
The current distribution is believed to be similar to its
historical distribution, with the exception that the species has
not been regularly reported since before its listing, in 1993,
along major riparian corridors in Arizona, New Mexico, and
Mexico, nor in the forests along the Colorado Front Range
(Ward et al. 1995).
The MSO nests, roosts, forages, and disperses in a variety of
habitats. Mixed conifer forests are commonly used
throughout most of the range. In general, these forests are
dominated by Douglas-fir and/or white fir, with codominant 
species including southwestern white pine, limber pine, and
ponderosa pine (Ganey and Dick 1995). Along the Mogollon
Rim in Arizona and New Mexico, MSO nest in mixed conifer
and ponderosa pine–Gambel oak forests, as well as rocky
canyons (Ganey and Dick 1995; May and Gutiérrez 2002).
South of the Mogollon Rim and into Mexico, a still wider
variety of habitats are used, including mixed conifer, Madrean
pine-oak, and Arizona cypress forests, encinal oak woodlands,
and associated riparian forests (Ganey and Dick 1995). MSOs
generally do not nest in pure stands of ponderosa pine
(Ganey and Dick 1995).
Nesting most commonly occurs in closed-canopy forests or
rocky canyons. Nests are often located in tree cavities or dwarf
mistletoe brooms, but are also placed in caves or cliff ledges in
steep-walled canyons in northern Arizona and southern Utah
and Colorado. Within forested habitat, MSO show a strong
preference for closed-canopy stands with a high basal area
(Ganey and Dick 1995; Seamans and Gutiérrez 1995). Such
stands may provide a more moderate microclimate during the
day, as well as greater concealment from avian predators for
both roosting adults and young near the nest (Ganey 2004;
USFWS 1995). In pine-oak habitat, researchers have found
that mature Gambel oak trees are extremely important as nest
sites (May and Gutiérrez 2002; Seamans et al. 1999), and may
also provide food and nest site resources for owl prey.

Integrating Forest Restoration Treatments with Mexican Spotted Owl Habitat Needs a
In ponderosa pine–Gambel oak habitat south of Flagstaff,
Ganey et al. (1999) found that 75 percent of owl use was in
stands with canopy cover of greater than 40 percent. Owls did
not roost in stands with canopy cover of less than 25 percent.
In mixed conifer forests on the Coconino National Forest,
owls selected areas characterized by canopy closures of 55
percent or more (May and Gutiérrez 2002). In the
Sacramento Mountains of New Mexico, Ganey et al. (2003)
found that all but two roosting stands in mixed conifer forests
had canopy cover greater than 40 percent, and 75 percent of
stands used for roosting had canopy cover greater than 60
percent.
MSO use a much wider variety of habitat types for foraging
than for nesting or roosting. Year-round residents often use
larger ranges during the nonbreeding season than during the
breeding season, and some owls appear to shift their habitat
entirely in winter. Seasonal movements of up to 30 miles have
been recorded from pine-oak and mixed conifer habitats to
lower elevations, including piñon-juniper woodlands and
even the interface between such woodlands and desert scrub
(Ganey and Block 2005).
The sizes of individual home ranges—or the areas used by
individual animals during their normal activities—vary
considerably among habitats (USFWS 1995). Home range
sizes recorded during several radio-telemetry studies have
varied from 645 to 3,672 acres for individuals and 941 to
3,831 acres for pairs (Ganey et al. 1999; USFWS 1995; Willey
1998). Annual home range sizes for owls in pine-oak forests
and in the canyonlands of southern Utah are among the
largest recorded.
Mexican Spotted Owls and Historical
Forest Conditions
Key Points
•
In the past MSOs likely lived in patches of suitable
habitat set in a matrix of more open ponderosa pine
forests.
•
It is important to consider fuel reduction and
restoration treatments both in MSO habitat—usually
pine-oak or mixed conifer stands—and in the
surrounding ponderosa pine forest matrix.
Reconstruction of historical forest conditions through
dendrochronology, historic accounts, and other methods has
shown that many southwestern ponderosa pine forests were
relatively open before the onset of large-scale logging,
livestock grazing, and fire exclusion (Covington and Moore
1994; Covington 2003). How did a species that relies largely
on dense forest stands survive in these conditions? It is likely
that MSO nested and roosted in relatively dense stands of
mixed conifer, pine-oak, and riparian forest embedded within
a matrix of more open-structured pine forest (Ganey and
Dick 1995; Ganey et al. 1999; Beier and Maschinski 2003).
Many of these areas, such as north-facing slopes and moist
canyons, may have been able to avoid most of the frequent
surface fires that maintained open stands of ponderosa pine,
and could have developed into closed-canopy forests subject
to a stand-replacing but highly infrequent fire regime. In
addition, MSO probably occurred in pine-oak stands that
may have had a fairly open structure of ponderosa pines but
also a significant Gambel oak component, such as those
documented at Camp Navajo in northern Arizona (Fulé et al.
1997). Other habitats once used by MSO, in particular lower-
elevation riparian areas, have been lost to the species because
of human development and extreme habitat alterations
(Ganey and Dick 1995).
Many of these forested areas are today at increased risk of
severe wildfire both because of increased tree density within
them and because of the greatly increased severity of fires that
originate in the surrounding ponderosa pine matrix and enter
mixed conifer or pine-oak MSO habitat as crown fires
(Jenness et al. 2004). Reduction of fire risk both within and
outside MSO habitat, then, is important to the species’
continuing viability.
However, reducing fire risk cannot be the only goal in
managing these forests. Relatively dense reserve areas suitable
for MSO nesting and roosting are crucial to the survival of
the species (Ganey et al. 1999). Some pine-oak stands have
changed substantially since the onset of Euro-American
settlement (Ruess 1995; Fulé et al. 1997). Regardless whether
they functioned as MSO habitat prior to Euro-American
settlement of the region, some such stands provide nesting
and/or foraging habitat for MSO today. They may
compensate, in part, for the loss of MSO habitat elements
elsewhere within the species’ range.
Managing such areas for conservation of the MSO, as
required by the Endangered Species Act, requires careful
balancing with restoration needs; rather than attempting to
restore them to presettlement conditions, it may often be
more appropriate to attempt to secure them from severe
wildfire by restoring adjoining ponderosa pine forest areas
(Brown et al. 2004).
Legal Status
Key Point
•
The MSO is a federally listed threatened species, and
managers are legally mandated to consider its needs
in management actions.
The MSO was federally listed as a threatened species by the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in 1993 (USFWS
1993). Even-aged timber harvest and catastrophic fire were
identified as the primary threats to the species, with grazing,
recreation, and other land-use practices listed as additional
threats. A Recovery Plan was finalized in December 1995; as
of this printing, it is being reviewed and revised.
Critical habitat for the MSO has been proposed and finalized
three times as a result of legal challenges and subsequent
court rulings. The most recent designation was finalized on
August 31, 2004, and designated approximately 8.6 million
acres of potential critical habitat in Arizona, New Mexico,
Utah, and Colorado (USFWS 2004c). Within this larger
region, critical habitat is limited to areas that meet the
following definitions:
•
Protected Habitat includes all known owl sites and all
areas within mixed conifer or pine-oak habitat with
slopes greater than 40 percent where timber harvest has
not occurred in the past 20 years.
•
Restricted Habitat, encompassing habitat not known to
be currently occupied by nesting owls but potentially
suitable, includes mixed conifer forest, pine-oak forest,
and riparian areas outside of Protected Habitat.

Integrating Forest Restoration Treatments with Mexican Spotted Owl Habitat Needs
a
•
Protected Activity Centers (PACs) are core 600-acre areas
designated around nest sites within Protected Habitat
areas, with an additional 100-acre center area identified
around nest sites.
Critical habitat is further characterized by the presence of
primary constituent elements, or landscape features that
fulfill habitat needs for nesting, roosting, foraging, or
dispersal. Elements relating both to habitat structure and prey
availability were defined for both forest and canyon areas. For
forested areas, they include the following forest structural
qualities:
•
A range of tree species, including mixed conifer, pine-
oak, and riparian forest types, composed of different
tree sizes reflecting different ages of trees, 30 to 45
percent of which are large trees with diameter at breast
height (dbh) of 12 inches or more.
•
A shade canopy created by the tree branches covering
40 percent or more of the ground.
•
Large snags with a dbh of at least 12 inches.
Primary constituent elements related to the maintenance of
adequate prey species include:
•
High volumes of fallen trees and other woody debris.
•
A wide range of tree and plant species, including
hardwoods.
•
Adequate levels of residual plant cover to maintain
fruits and seeds and allow plant regeneration.
Population Numbers and Current Trends
Key Points
•
Monitoring has been insufficient to accurately
determine MSO population trends.
•
Research shows that MSO recruitment levels vary a
great deal, and as a result the species is vulnerable to
factors that increase adult mortality.
Although the MSO is listed as a threatened species, a reliable
estimate of numbers of owls throughout its range is not
currently available, and the quality and quantity of
information regarding numbers of MSO varies by source. It is
clear that the great majority of individuals in the U.S. live on
lands administered by Region 3 of the Forest Service (Arizona
and New Mexico); 91 percent of MSO locations recorded
from 1991 to 1993 were on these lands (USFWS 1995).
Population estimates from a variety of surveys include the
following:
•
2,074 individuals in Arizona and New Mexico (Fletcher
and Hollis 1994)
•
2,160 individuals throughout U. S. range (USFWS
1991)
•
2,941 individuals in Upper Gila Mountains Recovery
Unit (Ganey et al. 2004), though this estimate included
an uncertainty (SE) of plus or minus 1,075 individuals
•
987 PACs (supporting 987 to 1,960 individuals) in
Forest Service Region 3 (USFWS 2004a)
•
12 PACs (12 to 24 individuals) in Colorado and 105
(105 to 210 individuals) in Utah (USFWS 2004b)
•
41 PACs in Grand Canyon National Park (pers. comm.,
R. V. Ward, Grand Canyon National Park, 2004)
A reliable estimate of the amount of MSO habitat in the U.S.
is unavailable, but regional habitat mapping exercises
conducted in 2001 identified approximately 6.6 million acres
of MSO habitat on National Forest lands in Arizona and New
Mexico (USFWS 2004b). This figure included 588,000 acres in
PACs, 2.1 million acres of other Protected Habitat, and 3.9
million acres of Restricted Habitat. The USFWS considers
estimates of PAC numbers and habitat acres on other public
lands to be deficient (USFWS 2004b).
The trends this population is undergoing are uncertain, as no
range-wide population monitoring has been done. A study of
MSO population dynamics was undertaken by researchers in
one study area (encompassing 63 territories) in Arizona and
one area (47 territories) in New Mexico from 1991 through
2002. The initial publication of the findings reported that
both study populations were declining at 10 percent a year or
more, and that owl survival rates in Arizona may be declining
over time (Seamans et al. 1999). Reduced habitat quality and
regional trends in climate were cited as two possible reasons
for these declines. The final report found that owl
reproduction varied greatly over time, while survival varied
little (Gutiérrez et al. 2003). The Arizona population was
considered stable, while that in New Mexico declined at an
annual rate of about 6 percent. The study concluded that
MSO can experience great annual fluctuations in numbers
due to high annual variation in recruitment. That variability
makes the species quite vulnerable to factors that reduce adult
survival during years of low recruitment (USFWS 2004b).
Wildfire and Mexican Spotted 
Owl Habitat
Key Points
•
High-severity wildfire is one of the primary threats to
the MSO.
•
Effects of fire on MSOs can be mixed, and can range
from habitat destruction to increases in prey base.
The MSO Recovery Plan (USFWS 1995) cites high-severity
wildfire as one of the primary threats to the species and its
habitat in nearly all recovery units. The USFWS (2004a)
reported that stand-replacing fires have affected hundreds of
thousands of acres of MSO habitat in the Southwest since
1996. In 2002 the 462,384-acre Rodeo-Chediski Fire burned
through approximately 55 PACs on the Tonto and Apache-
Sitgreaves national forests and the White Mountain Apache
Reservation. Of the 11,986 acres of PAC habitat that burned
on national forest lands, approximately 55 percent burned at
moderate to high severity (USFWS 2004b), meaning that
burned trees either retained some needles or were completely
dead. Based on fire severity maps, the FWS estimates that
tribal and private lands in this wildfire likely burned in a
similar fashion. Table 1 lists the effects of a number of recent
large fires on MSO PACs.
Current trends in both forest ecology and climate change
suggest that fires in the western United States may continue to
become more frequent and more severe, threatening the
viability of species that rely on relatively dense forest stands
(McKenzie et al. 2004). The combination of severe,
unnaturally intense wildfires with the cumulative effects of
other human-caused changes to MSO habitat—such as
logging, livestock grazing, habitat loss, and recreation—
represents a serious threat to the species’ continued viability.

Integrating Forest Restoration Treatments with Mexican Spotted Owl Habitat Needs a
Specific information about the impact of wildfire on MSO
habitat is limited due to lack of empirical information,
including pre-wildfire surveys; refined mapping tools to
determine the variable impacts of wildfire on important
habitat components; and post-wildfire monitoring of
vegetation, prey species, and owls themselves. It is also
difficult to assess fire impacts on habitat because they can be
exacerbated by human responses to fire, especially fire
suppression and timber salvage activities.
Effects of Fire
In some cases fire burns severely enough to kill trees used for
nesting and roosting, altering habitat to such a degree that it
is no longer suitable for MSO. Yet spotted owls have high site
fidelity, and individuals may remain in their historically used
core home range even as the habitat in it becomes less suitable
(Forsman et al. 1984). They become more vulnerable to
predators due to lack of cover, and are less likely to reproduce
successfully if nesting and prey habitat have been degraded.
Fires, whether prescribed or naturally ignited, can also destroy
snags and downed woody debris (Randall-Parker and Miller
2002), thereby degrading habitat conditions for MSO prey
species in the short term.
In many cases wildfires burn in a mosaic of severity levels and
may actually improve overall habitat conditions for the MSO
in the short term. The improvement in habitat conditions
comes in the form of increased vegetative diversity and initial
herbaceous growth, if precipitation allows, which in turn can
result in increased prey densities, thereby providing a short-
term benefit to MSO (Bond et al. 2002). Jenness et al. (2004)
monitored MSO habitat sites within four years after fires in
Arizona and New Mexico and found no large differences in
site occupancy and reproduction between burned and
unburned areas. In the long term, though, fires burning at a
high level of severity represent a major departure from the
natural range of variability of most southwestern forests, and
represent a significant threat to the continued viability of the
MSO (Jenness et al. 2004). A modeling effort focused on
California spotted owls (S. o. occidentalis) concluded that
potential high-intensity fire represents a larger risk, in the
long term, to this subspecies’ persistence than mechanical
thinning intended to reduce fire risks (Lee and Irwin 2005);
the same is probably true for MSO.
Effects of Fire Suppression and Post-Fire Response
The impact of fire suppression activities on habitat quality
can, in some cases, exceed that of the fire itself (Backer et al.
2004). Backfires may char MSO habitat. Low-flying aircraft
dropping water or retardant may result in disturbance or
injury. Bulldozer lines compact the soil and may cause
erosion, which in turn can affect the quality of MSO nesting
and foraging habitat. Dozer lines can easily become avenues
for recreational vehicle access, and hand lines can result in
hiker and mountain bike disturbance to nesting owls. Invasive
or noxious weed species transported on the wheels of heavy
equipment can affect the foraging success and abundance of
prey species.
Post-fire salvage treatments can also affect MSO habitat. The
long-term effects of salvage logging on MSO have not been
studied, but Beschta et al. (2004) state that post-fire
treatments, such as salvage logging, livestock grazing, and
seeding of exotic species, can further alter succession and

Case Study: Woody Ridge Forest Restoration Project, Coconino National Forest
The Woody Ridge Forest Restoration Project is underway on 31,000 acres southwest of Flagstaff, Arizona, in an area
immediately adjacent to various subdivision communities and other private, county, city, and federal facilities. Objectives of
the project include restoration of forest health and decreasing the potential for stand-replacing wildfire. Project activities
include mechanical thinning and broadcast burning of ponderosa pine–Gambel oak forest. Thinning treatments fall into
three categories:
•
fuels reduction with a fire risk reduction emphasis;
•
fuels reduction adjusted to maintain habitat for MSO, northern goshawk, wild turkey, and black bear;
•
fuels reduction with an emphasis on American pronghorn habitat.
Other project activities include road obliteration and closure and construction of non-motorized trails.
Four MSO PACs fall entirely or partially within the project area. The project follows Recovery Plan recommendations and
Forest Plan standards and guidelines for fuel reduction treatments within MSO Protected and Restricted Habitat. Thinning of
trees under 9 inches dbh and prescribed burning will take place within MSO PACs. Restricted Habitat will be thinned from
below using prescriptions that maintain moderate to high canopy closure (40 to 60 percent), and patches or clumps of up to
four acres in size. In Restricted Habitat with a wildfire risk reduction emphasis, canopy closure will be maintained at 30 to 40
percent, and canopy layers will be reduced. In order to mitigate the loss of large logs during burning, the Forest Service will
create replacement logs in Restricted Habitat by leaving some trees 12 to 18 inches dbh cut and on the ground to replace those
lost during the first prescribed fire after thinning.
This project had consistent input from the USFWS during the planning phase, and consultation was completed informally
within 60 days of receipt of the Biological Assessment.

Integrating Forest Restoration Treatments with Mexican Spotted Owl Habitat Needs
a
delay restoration of sites by degrading nesting and foraging
habitat, and can exacerbate the damage that may have resulted
to soils from fire.
Forest Restoration and Mexican 
Spotted Owl Habitat
Key Points
•
Managers can conduct restoration treatments in
much MSO habitat according to criteria established in
the MSO Recovery Plan.
•
Managers should conduct restoration treatments in
ponderosa pine forests around MSO habitat in order
to protect those habitats, reduce the risk of large-scale
wildfire, and increase forest health.
Unlike simple fuels treatments aimed at reducing fire risks,
comprehensive restoration treatments look beyond immediate
societal demands to critical ecological processes (see Working
Paper 4: Fuels Treatments and Forest Restoration: An Analysis of
Benefits). They require an integrated, multi-disciplinary
approach that is rooted in conservation biology and that
combines the protection of intact, healthy landscapes with
active restoration of degraded areas (DellaSala et al. 2003).
They can incorporate management activities ranging from
allowing lightning-ignited fires to burn, to thinning
treatments that remove a significant percentage of living trees.
Regardless of the tactics used, wildlife and understory
vegetation are integral parts of the forest ecosystem and must
be considered when planning and implementing restoration
treatments.
Not all areas occupied by MSO have the same restoration
needs. Active thinning and prescribed fire treatments can
contribute toward the restoration of ecological structures and
functions, and are needed in many places. But they are not
needed everywhere. In some places natural fire can serve the
same purpose, especially in designated wilderness areas, forest
tracts well outside the wildland-urban interface, and other
areas where topography allows (Kauffman 2004). In such
areas land managers can write plans for the management of
natural fires. If MSO habitat is present in a given area,
consultation with the USFWS is necessary in the writing of
such plans. Completion of the legally required National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documentation and
Section 7 consultation are integral to the planning process.
The Recovery Plan makes precise recommendations for
restoration treatments in MSO Protected and Restricted
Habitat (http://endangered.fws.gov/i/B6V.html). These
recommendations are an excellent starting point. In some
cases managers may want to diverge from them in order to
meet a specified goal. Consultation with the USFWS (see
below) is the key to diverging from Recovery Plan
specifications.
In addition, managers should prioritize restoration treatments
around designated MSO habitat areas (Ganey et al. 1999) to
promote overall forest health, reduce fire risk to human
communities, and minimize fire threats to MSO habitat. Most
ponderosa pine forests without a large oak component do not
support breeding MSO, and these areas are also often most in
need of restoration treatments. Such tracts offer prime
opportunities for returning to self-sustaining ecological
conditions in which frequent, low-intensity fires maintain
open stands and minimize risks of severe fire (see Working 
Paper 9: Restoration of Southwestern Ponderosa Pine Forests to
Presettlement Conditions).
Restoration treatments undertaken in pure ponderosa pine
stands should consider impacts to nearby known MSO
habitats. They can improve MSO habitat conditions by
promoting the growth of a healthy herbaceous understory
and by incorporating occasional denser stands, especially
along the edges of treatment areas. These areas of denser
canopy can be juxtaposed in such a way as to reduce the risk
of spreading fire between the canopies. Slash treatment
should seek a balance between reducing the risk of stand-
replacing fire while still allowing the retention of sufficient
woody debris to provide prey habitat and help protect soils
from erosion. Many MSO nesting and roosting areas will
inevitably remain susceptible to fire by virtue of their density,
but reducing crown fire risks in the ponderosa pine landscape
around them will reduce the risk that high-severity fire will
travel into them from outside.
Treatment Recommendations
Each restoration treatment should be site-specific, but in
general following these recommendations will protect MSO
habitat attributes while reducing fire risk and restoring forest
health to MSO habitats and adjacent areas.
Around Protected and Restricted Habitat
•
In ponderosa pine forests around MSO habitat, conduct
restoration treatments of sufficient size and intensity to
reduce the risk that high-severity fire will enter MSO
habitat from the surrounding matrix.
•
Where possible, prioritize treatments so that they
reduce wildfire risks in designated MSO habitat, such as
in areas upwind of or topographically below MSO
habitat.
In Protected and Restricted Habitat
•
Follow the recommendations of the MSO Recovery
Plan (USFWS 1995) for treatments in pine-oak and
mixed conifer Protected and Restricted Habitat.
•
Determine if Gambel oak is present in the project area
and vicinity by on-site surveys, as its presence can be
difficult to detect by traditional classification
procedures and current remote-sensing equipment
(May and Gutiérrez 2002); determine if the amount of
oak meets the Recovery Plan definition for pine-oak
habitat.
•
If Restricted or Protected Habitat is present, survey for
MSO within and immediately adjacent to the project
area according to the recommended USFWS protocol.
•
Don’t cut trees over 24 inches dbh in Restricted Habitat.
•
Minimize harvest of, damage to, and fire loss of large
trees over 18 inches dbh in Restricted Habitat.
•
Protect large oak trees from all project activities and
from woodcutters (Seamans et al. 1999; May and
Gutiérrez 2002).
•
Maintain adequate canopy cover in Restricted Habitat
to allow for nesting, roosting, foraging, and dispersal.
For roosting this is generally 40 percent or greater in
pine-oak habitat, and 55 percent or greater in mixed
conifer (Ganey et al. 1999; May and Gutiérrez 2002).
•
In Restricted Habitat, identify “target-threshold habitat”
as required by the Recovery Plan
(http://ifw2es.fws.gov/mso/recovery_plan.htm).
•
Manage prescribed fire in order to retain and/or create
some snags and downed woody debris.

Integrating Forest Restoration Treatments with Mexican Spotted Owl Habitat Needs a
7
In PACs
•
Designate and protect the 100-acre PAC center from all
activity, including any thinning.
•
Don’t cut trees over 9 inches dbh in PACs.
•
Conduct management activities within PACs outside
the breeding season (March 1 – August 31).
•
Close all unnecessary roads in PACs.
•
Minimize recreation within PACs to the extent
possible.
Navigating Section 7 Consultation: 
What Managers Need to Know
Neglecting MSO habitat and even adjacent areas, as has often
been done while planning restoration treatments, leaves
habitat for this threatened species at risk of stand-replacing
wildfire, and in many cases may leave communities in the
wildland-urban interface at risk. The Recovery Plan clearly
encourages certain treatments within owl habitat. Its
recommendations allow varying treatment intensities.
Managers have the clear option—and, indeed, a
responsibility—to begin flexible and useful restoration
treatments in and, especially, around owl habitat. If
approached in a manner that considers the
recommendations of the Recovery Plan, Section 7
consultation can be conducted efficiently and effectively.
It is advantageous to work with the USFWS through the
Section 7 consultation process, and not only because
consultation is a legal requirement. Close collaboration will
help to ensure that the proposed project minimizes impacts
to threatened species wherever possible, and will help to
make the project defensible to potential critics. Land
managers can navigate through the consultation process
successfully, and in a timely manner, if a few important
factors and processes are addressed.
Involve FWS personnel early in the project planning. Seek
their input early and often. Discuss how the project can best
protect owl habitat, and, if appropriate, how management
can help create owl habitat over time. Discuss the project in
detail over the phone, at face-to-face meetings, and,
preferably, in the field. Incorporate USFWS
recommendations into the project whenever possible.
Prepare a well-written and biologically sound Biological
Assessment. The assessment should address how the project
follows the Recovery Plan recommendations. If it does not
follow all recommendations, a clear and justified explanation
should be provided, along with appropriate conservation
measures. Ensure that all PACs are designated and 100-acre
centers are drawn for owl territories within and adjacent to
the project area. Clearly state the amount and location of all
areas designated as Protected and Restricted Habitat and
details of owl surveys that have been conducted or are
planned. Work with the USFWS to determine the
appropriate effect determination so that there are no
surprises for either agency. Provide all the details the USFWS
will need in order to prepare the appropriate
documentation—a concurrence letter or a Biological
Opinion. Doing so will allow the USFWS to provide
necessary documentation in a timely manner. Additional
recommendations are available at
http://arizonaes.fws.gov/Documents/Consultations/GENE
RALBE.pdf.
In summary, the most effective way to navigate through the
Section 7 consultation process for the MSO is to understand
the purpose of the Endangered Species Act, thoroughly read
and understand the management recommendations in the
MSO Recovery Plan, maintain an active dialogue with
USFWS personnel, and attempt to design treatments that
assist in the recovery of the MSO while also meeting other
goals.
