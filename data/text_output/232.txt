Abstract
In the late 1800s, fire suppression, livestock grazing,
and a wet and warm climate led to an irruption of
pine regeneration in Pinus ponderosa Laws. (ponde-
rosa pine) forests of the southwestern United States.
Pines invaded bunchgrass openings, causing stand
structure changes that increased the number of stand-
replacing fires. Ecological restoration, via thinning and
prescribed burning, is being used to decrease the risk
of stand-replacing fires and ameliorate other effects of
pine invasion. The effects of aboveground restoration
on belowground processes are poorly understood. We
used a hydrologic model and soil water nutrient con-
centrations, measured monthly below the rooting zone,
to estimate restoration effects on nutrient losses by
leaching from a mature ponderosa pine forest near
Flagstaff, Arizona. Replicated restoration treatments
included thinning to pre-1880 stand densities (partial
restoration), thinning plus forest floor fuel reduction
followed by a prescribed burn (complete restoration),
and an untreated control. Water outflow occurred only
between January and May and was lowest from the
control (47 and 28 mm in 1995 and 1996) and highest
from the partial restoration treatment (67 and 59 mm in
1995 and 1996). The concentrations (typically 
 
,
 
0.10
mg/ L) and estimated annual losses (
 
,
 
0.02 kg/ha) of
 
NH41-N, PO432-P, and organic P were similar among
treatments. Nitrate and organic N concentrations were
as high as 0.80 mg N/L; however, these concentrations
and estimated annual losses (,0.13 kg N/ha) were
similar among treatments. Our results suggest that
restoration will not enhance nutrient loss by leaching
or alter stream chemistry in ponderosa pine forests.
Introduction
H
istorically, ponderosa pine forests of the south-
western United States were composed of sparse
clusters of trees (z50 trees per ha) surrounded by
bunchgrass openings (Cooper 1960; Covington et al.
1994, 1997). Frequent (2–12 years) low-intensity fires,
competition with grasses, and drought limited pine re-
generation in the bunchgrass openings (Pearson 1950;
White 1985; Savage et al. 1996; Swetnam & Baisan 1996).
Following Euro-American settlement in the late 1800s,
fire suppression, livestock grazing, and a wet and
warm climate eliminated constraints on pine regenera-
tion, allowing most bunchgrass openings to be filled
with dense thickets of small pines. Consequently, the
contemporary forest landscape (Fig. 1) typically has
stand densities exceeding 1000 trees per ha, only 10%

bunchgrass cover, and an increased frequency of stand-
replacing fires (Weaver 1952; Covington & Moore 1994;
Covington et al. 1994, 1997; Swetnam & Baisan 1996).
Ecological restoration is being used to decrease the
number of stand-replacing fires, increase the produc-
tion and diversity of herbaceous species, decrease mor-
tality of old trees, and increase water and nutrient avail-
ability (Covington et al. 1997). In 1993 and 1994, a
replicated restoration experiment was established to
test effects of two restoration treatments on a mature
ponderosa pine forest near Flagstaff, Arizona (Fig. 2).
Restoration treatments included thinning to presettle-
ment stand densities (partial restoration), and thinning
in conjunction with forest floor fuel reduction and a
prescribed burn (complete restoration). We previously
reported that restoration treatments increased net N
mineralization rates at this site (Kaye & Hart 1998). Ele-
vated nutrient cycling rates caused by, or in conjunction
with, reduced plant uptake have been shown to in-
crease nutrient losses from some ecosystems (Likens et
al. 1969; Vitousek & Melillo 1979; Vitousek et al. 1982).
However, if nutrient immobilization into plant re-
growth or microbial biomass is high, nutrient losses
may not occur (Coats et al. 1976; Richter et al. 1982; Vi-
tousek & Matson 1985; Knight et al. 1991).
Nutrient leaching following disturbance (in this case
restoration treatment) is problematic when leachates
pollute stream water or when a limiting nutrient is lost
from the ecosystem. Soil leaching losses are most
readily measured using the small watershed approach
(Bormann & Likens 1967). However, this method is of-
ten not very useful in the semiarid Southwest because
the bedrock is typically permeable to deep seepage, and
precipitation patterns are so variable that stream water
sampling and runoff quantification are difficult. Fur-
thermore, estimates of treatment-induced changes in
nutrient leaching using the small watershed approach
require that the treatment be applied to an entire water-
shed, which is impractical for many restoration efforts.
We coupled a hydrologic model that estimates water
outflow with monthly measurements of nutrient con-
centrations in soil water below the rooting zone to esti-
mate nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) exports from
control and restoration treatments from April 1995 to
March 1997. Because restoration increases net N miner-
alization rates (Kaye & Hart 1998), we hypothesized
that N concentrations in soil water would be higher in
restoration treatments relative to the control. Similarly,
we hypothesized that nutrient outflow would be higher
following restoration because reductions in leaf area
should decrease evapotranspiration.
Methods
Study Site and Treatments
The research was conducted in the Gus Pearson Natural
Area within the U.S. Forest Service Fort Valley Experi-
mental Forest, 10 km northwest of Flagstaff, Arizona.
Mean annual precipitation is 577 mm, half of which
falls as snow, and half as summer monsoonal rains
(Schubert 1974; Savage et al. 1996). Mean annual air
temperature is 7.58C, with an average of 94 frost-free
days. The soil is derived from flow and cinder basalt
and is classified as Brolliar stony clay loam, a fine,
smectitic, Typic Argiboroll. The area was never logged,
but livestock grazing occurred between 1876 and 1910.
The dominant vegetation is Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa
pine) forest composed of large (37–104 cm dbh) uneven-
aged presettlement pines surrounded by small (,37 cm
dbh) uneven-aged postsettlement pines or relict bunch-
grass openings (herbaceous species are listed in Kaye &
Hart 1998). Before treatment, postsettlement trees cov-
ered approximately 80% of the area relative to 10% cover
by grassy openings and presettlement pines (Fig. 1).
Fifteen 0.25-ha plots were established and assigned to
three treatments: control, partial restoration, and com-
plete restoration. Because a fuel break was needed to
protect buildings of the historical Fort Valley Experi-
ment Station, the 10 restoration treatment plots were as-
signed randomly (five as partial restoration and five as
complete restoration) to the plots closest to the build-
ings. The remaining five plots were assigned to the con-
trol, which was left untreated. The partial restoration
treatment removed (via whole-tree harvesting) most of
Figure 2. The partial (thinning only) and complete (thinning, 
forest floor manipulation, and a prescribed burn) restoration 
treatments of the ecological restoration experiment at the Gus 
Pearson Natural Area near Flagstaff, Arizona. Ecological res-
toration to presettlement conditions required the removal of 
most of the postsettlement tree biomass. The resulting stands 
had greater herbaceous biomass than the pretreatment stands 
and would likely support surface, rather than stand replacing 
fires.

the aboveground postsettlement tree biomass from the
site to test whether thinning alone could restore ecosys-
tem structure and function. The complete restoration
treatment included postsettlement tree removal, forest
floor manipulation, and a prescribed burn and was de-
signed to test whether ecosystem structure and function
could be restored quickly through intense manipula-
tions (Covington et al. 1997). Forest floor manipulation
included raking aside the Oi layer and removing the Oa
and Oe layers from the site. The Oi layer (two to four
years of litterfall) was then returned to the soil surface,
along with z672 kg/ha of native grasses and forbs
mowed from nearby Hart Prairie. These forest floor ma-
nipulations were intended to emulate the fuel load of
presettlement forests. Thinning was implemented in the
fall of 1993 and the prescribed burn in the fall of 1994.
Figure 2 includes both partial and complete restoration
plots following treatment. More details on the treat-
ments and fire are presented in Covington et al. (1997).
Within each plot, we stratified sampling beneath
three or four canopy types. Canopy type sample areas
(subplots) were selected randomly from the population
of potential subplots for a given canopy type within
each plot. In all treatments, we located subplots beneath
presettlement pines, postsettlement pines, and in grassy
openings (n 5 3 treatments 3 3 canopy types 3 repli-
cates 5 45 subplots). In the partial and complete resto-
ration treatments, subplots were also established in ar-
eas where postsettlement pines had been removed
(called “postsettlement removed” subplots; n 5 2 treat-
ments 3 1 canopy type 3 5 replicates 5 10 subplots).
Soil Nutrient Concentrations
Porous ceramic cup (z1.1 mm openings) tension lysim-
eters (Soilmoisture Equipment Corporation, Santa Bar-
bara, California, U.S.A.) were used to collect soil water
below the rooting zone. A lysimeter was installed at a
fixed distance (4 m) but random direction from the cen-
ter of each subplot, unless coarse fragments or bedrock
prevented augering a hole to a 150 cm depth below the
ground surface. If such an obstruction was encoun-
tered, adjacent locations were probed with a metal rod
along the circumference of the subplot until a 150 cm
depth was reached, or until the greatest soil depth for
that subplot was determined. Once the sampling loca-
tion was established, a hole was dug using a bucket au-
ger. Lysimeter porous cups were firmly placed in silica
flour (200 mesh) that had been poured into each hole,
and each hole was then filled with a slurry made from
the original soil. Depths of porous cups ranged from 70
to 150 cm below the ground surface, which is below al-
most all of the fine roots and most of the coarse roots at
this site. All lysimeters were installed by January 1995
and sample collection began immediately. Here we re-
port data beginning in April 1995 to avoid possible ef-
fects of installation disturbance on nutrient concentra-
tions (Vitousek et al. 1982).
On the 15th of each month, a 50 kPa vacuum was ap-
plied to each lysimeter. Twenty-four hours later, the
vacuum was released, water in the lysimeter was col-
lected, the mass of the collection was recorded, and the
sample was frozen until analyses began. Ammonium
(NH41) and nitrate plus nitrite (NO32 1 NO22) concen-
trations were determined on a Lachat AE flow Injection
Autoanalyser (Lachat Instruments, Inc., Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, U.S.A.) using the indophenol-blue (Lachat
Instruments, Inc. 1990) and cadmium reduction-diazoti-
ation (Lachat Instruments, Inc. 1992a) methods, respec-
tively. Because NO22 levels were negligible, (NO32 1
NO22) are reported as NO32. Total N (organic 1 NH41)
and P (organic 
 
1
 
 PO43
 
2) were determined by modified
micro-Kjeldahl digestion (Parkinson & Allen 1975; Pace
et al. 1982) and flow injection analysis using the salicy-
late (Lachat Instruments, Inc. 1992b) and molybdate-
ascorbic acid (Lachat Instruments, Inc. 1992c) methods,
respectively. Organic N and organic P were determined
by subtracting NH41-N and PO432-P concentrations
from the total N and P concentrations, respectively. Nu-
trient concentrations from each subplot were weighted
by multiplying the concentration in the subplot by the
ratio of the mass of water collected in that subplot to the
total mass of water collected in the plot on that sam-
pling date.
Some authors have found that porous ceramic cups
adsorb PO43
 
2-P (Hansen & Harris 1975; Nagpal 1982;
Bottcher et al. 1984) while others have found no adsorp-
tion (Levin & Jackson 1977). Despite these mixed re-
sults, ecologists frequently use ceramic cup lysimeters
to estimate P leaching (Adams & Attiwill 1991; Chor-
over et al. 1994; Johnson et al. 1997) because alternative
materials (Teflon and fritted glass) are fragile, expen-
sive, and perform poorly in unsaturated soils (Bottcher
et al. 1984; Litaor 1988). We caution that the PO432
leaching values reported here may be underestimated
due to PO432 adsorption by the lysimeter ceramic cups.
Hydrologic Model
The models MT-CLIM (Running et al. 1987; Glassy &
Running 1994) and Forest-BGC (Running & Coughlan
1988) were used to calculate water outflow from the
plots. MT-CLIM was used to calculate daily incoming
solar radiation from inputs of daily minimum and max-
imum air temperature, dewpoint, precipitation, latitude
(35.268), aspect (220.08), slope (1.138), elevation (2205 m),
and east and west horizons (both 0.08). Daily minimum
and maximum air temperatures were measured at one
point within each treatment (1 m height) using a CR10
Campbell Scientific datalogger and radiation-shielded

thermistors (Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, Utah,
U.S.A.). Precipitation was measured in an open area be-
tween plots using the same datalogger and an unheated
tipping bucket rain gauge (Texas Electronics, Inc., Dal-
las, Texas, U.S.A.). When air temperatures were below
08C, we used snow-water equivalent data from the
Bellemont, Arizona National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) weather station. We used a lin-
ear regression of dewpoint versus night minimum air
temperature from the Flagstaff, Arizona NOAA weather
station (dewpoint 5 0.7 * minimum air temp 1 2.51; r2 5
0.63; n 5 359) to estimate dewpoint (Running et al.
1987; Glassy & Running 1994). The Flagstaff and Belle-
mont weather stations are similar in elevation to, and
about equidistant from (z15 km) our site. The daily so-
lar radiation output from MT-CLIM was input into For-
est-BGC along with all MT-CLIM input parameters, ini-
tial snowpack, initial soil water content, soil water
holding capacity (1600 m3/ha), leaf carbon (C), and spe-
cific leaf area. We modelled initial water content and
snowpack by simulating hydrologic fluxes beginning in
July 1994 when soil water content was at a minimum
(450 m3/ha) and no snowpack was present. The Forest-
BGC model was run separately for each plot and year
(1995, 1996, and 1997) using field-based estimates of
leaf biomass measured in that plot and year. Soil water
holding capacity (i.e., plant available water in Forest-
BGC) was estimated from the difference between volu-
metric water content in the upper 30 cm of mineral soil
at field capacity and the minimum soil water content
observed in this layer during the year (typically late
June; Feeney 1997). Leaf C was determined by adding
grass and pine foliar C (M.M. Moore, P.Z. Fulé, and
W.W. Covington, Northern Arizona University, Flag-
staff, Arizona, U.S.A., unpublished data, 1994–1996,
and assuming C is 50% of mass) for each plot. The spe-
cific leaf area (SLA) for grasses was 42.0 m2/kg, which
is the mean of values reported for the two most com-
mon grasses at our site (
 
Sitanion hysterix
 
 (Nutt.) and
 
Muhlenbergia montana
 
 (Nutt.) Hitchc.; Naumburg 1996).
The SLA for pines was 9.0 m2/kg (Stone 1997). The SLA
for a plot was determined using the biomass-weighted
mean of pine and grass SLAs. Forest-BGC multiplied SLA
(per unit C) by foliar C to determine the leaf area index
for each plot (Table 1). The daily water outflow values
from Forest-BGC were summed to produce monthly es-
timates. Monthly nutrient losses were determined by
multiplying mass-weighted concentrations (see above)
measured mid-month by modeled water outflow esti-
mates for that month.
Statistical Analyses
Because the postsettlement removed canopy type did
not exist in the control treatment, we determined can-
opy type differences by deleting postsettlement re-
moved data and analyzing presettlement, postsettle-
ment retained, and grass data as a two-way repeated
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with canopy
type and treatment as factors. To determine plot-scale
treatment effects that included the postsettlement re-
moved canopy type, we scaled all canopy type data to
the plot level using a Geographic Information System
(GIS). This GIS contained the area within each plot oc-
cupied by a given canopy type, allowing us to calculate
the proportional area of each canopy type within a plot.
Once scaled to the plot level, the data were analyzed us-
ing a one-way repeated measures ANOVA with treat-
ment as the factor. A factorial ANOVA was used for cu-
mulative losses. We log10-transformed data for ANOVA
analyses when variance was unequal among treatments
and canopy types. All statistical analyses were per-
formed using the statistical package StatView at the P 5

Results and Discussion
We are unable to assess quantitatively if the water out-
flows from our treated and control plots predicted by
FOREST-BGC are accurate. However, water outflow
predicted by FOREST-BGC for hypothetical forests in
Florida, Tennessee, and Wisconsin were similar to ac-
tual measurements from gauged watersheds in those
forest types (Running & Coughlan 1988). Furthermore,
for our site, FOREST-BGC accurately predicted the rela-
tive volume of soil water collected in tension lysimeters
placed below the rooting zone; very little if any water
was collected in lysimeters during periods when the
model predicted no outflow, while large volumes of
water were collected during the months of predicted
high outflow (data not shown). Hence, we feel that the
modeled quantities and temporal patterns of water out-
flow are reasonably accurate and precise.
Estimated monthly water outflow (Fig. 3) and annual
water outflow (Table 1) were greater in the complete
and partial restoration treatments than the control. Wa-
ter outflow was limited to the late winter and early
spring months. Apparently, summer monsoonal rains
were insufficient to saturate the soil profile and result in
deep percolation, a result supported by measurements
of volumetric soil water content during this period
(Feeney 1997). Our estimates of water loss (Table 1) are
lower than the 80-year annual mean (193 mm) esti-
mated by Savage et al. (1996) using a modified Thorn-
thwaite-Mather water balance model parameterized for
the same site. Total precipitation was 347 mm during
the April 1995–March 1996 period and 406 mm during
the April 1996–March 1997 period, which are consider-
ably below the 80-year mean annual precipitation mea-
sured at this site (577 mm for the period 1912–1993; Sav-
age et al. 1996). Nevertheless, both models provide
similar temporal patterns of water outflow, showing lit-
tle outflow during the summer. Summer monsoons also
did not generally increase stream flow in ponderosa
pine (Baker 1986) and chaparral watersheds (Hibbert et
al. 1974) located near the Mogollon rim (z50 km south
of our site). These results suggest that nutrient losses
from restored ponderosa pine forests, if they occur, will
be restricted to a narrow temporal window from ap-
proximately January to May.
For nutrients to be leached from the soil, water loss
must occur in concert with high concentrations of nutri-
ents in the soil solution. Prescribed fire and thinning
typically increase nutrient cycling rates and concentra-
tions in the surface soil of ponderosa pine forests
(Wagle & Kitchen 1972; Klemmedson 1976; White 1986;
Covington & Sackett 1986, 1992) as the restoration treat-
ments did at our site (Kaye & Hart 1998). When increases
in soil nutrient concentrations are not balanced by plant
uptake or microbial immobilization, there is potential
for nutrient loss (Likens et al. 1969; Coats et al. 1976;
Vitousek & Melillo 1979; Vitousek et al. 1982).
We found no differences in nutrient concentrations of
soil water collected below the rooting zone of our resto-
ration treatments (Fig. 4) or canopy types (Fig. 5). Simi-
larly, there were no differences in nutrient losses
among our restoration treatments by month (Fig. 6) or
year (Table 1). Temporal patterns in nutrient loss (Fig.
6) from the site reflected the marked temporal pattern
in water loss (Fig. 3) and the consistently low nutrient
concentrations in soil water below the rooting zone
(Fig. 4). Ammonium and PO432 concentrations and out-
flow were low throughout the collection period. This
result was expected because NH41 binds to soil cation
exchange sites, and the solubility of PO432 is generally
low in soil. Organic P is more mobile in soil than
PO432-P (Spencer & Stewart 1934; Hilbert et al. 1938;
Rolston et al. 1975); however, we found very low or-
ganic-P concentrations in deep soil solution and mini-
mal organic-P leaching, despite the abundance of P at
this site (the total N: total P ratio for the soil is z1; Kaye
& Hart 1998). Other studies measuring organic-P leach-
ing report similarly small values (Likens et al. 1977;
Schindler et al. 1980; Knight et al. 1985; Lowrance et al.
1985). Rolston et al. (1975) showed that organic P pene-
trated a clay loam soil about 10 cm deeper than inor-
ganic P. It is likely that organic P deposited in the most
biologically active portions of the soil (i.e., upper 15 cm
of mineral soil; Kaye & Hart 1998) was mineralized to
PO432 and subsequently adsorbed onto clay minerals,
or precipitated out of solution, before the organic P was
transported to the deep soil.

Nitrate is more mobile in soils than NH41, PO432, or
organic P, and losses of NO32 from disturbed ecosys-
tems are frequently reported (Vitousek & Melillo 1979).
At our site during the study period, concentrations of
NO32 ranged from 0 to 0.8 mg NO32-N/L below the
rooting zone, but generally were less than 0.2 mg NO32-
N/L (Fig. 4). Vitousek & Melillo (1979) synthesized
data from 18 forested sites with recently disturbed and
undisturbed control treatments. They reported mean
NO32-leaching losses ranging from 0.03 to 125.5 kg N/
ha/yr, and stream water and deep soil NO32 concentra-
tions ranging from 0.001 to 25 mg N/L. While some of
these sites showed increased losses following distur-
bance (which included various treatments that elimi-
nated or reduced plant nutrient uptake), others did not.
In the Southwest, Hibbert et al. (1974) found that con-
verting chaparral to grasslands in Arizona increased
stream NO32 concentrations from 0.05 to 12.6 mg N/L.
However, their converted watershed was considered
“deadened” because herbicide applications were part of
the conversion treatment. Gosz (1980) found low NO32-
leaching rates (0.0–0.4 kg N/ha/yr) from forested wa-
tersheds in New Mexico that included ponderosa pine
forests.
In recent studies assessing the role of thinning on
leaching loss of N outside the Southwest, Knight et al.
(1991) found deep soil NO32 concentrations similar to
ours in a thinned Pinus contorta (lodgepole pine) forest,
but much higher concentrations in a clearcut forest (up
to 4 mg N/L). Parsons et al. (1994) created different
sized gaps in lodgepole pine forests and found that
deep soil NO32 concentrations did not increase in small
gaps (,5 trees), but did increase as high as 1.6 mg N/L
in large gaps (.15 trees). Frazer et al. (1990) found that
control and regenerating mixed-conifer forests had
deep soil NO32 concentrations less than 0.5 mg N/L,
while a nearby clear-cut site had concentrations as high
as 2 mg N/L. In contrast, Hendrickson et al. (1989)
found that removing all biomass greater than 1.3 m in
height in a northern mixed forest resulted in lower deep
soil NO32 concentrations than cutting only trees greater
than 9 cm dbh and leaving slash on the site. With the
exception of this last study, previous research on the ef-
fects of thinning are in agreement with results from our
partial restoration treatment, suggesting that forest thin-
ning does not necessarily increase NO32 concentrations
below the rooting zone.
Fire has variable effects on NO32 leaching depending
mostly on fire intensity. Weston and Attiwill (1990)
found that crown and slash fires caused prolonged ele-
vations in deep soil NO32 concentrations in Eucalyptus
regnans forests while a surface fire did not. Richter et al.
(1982) reported no increase in stream water or deep soil
NO32 concentrations following several prescribed sur-
face fires in Pinus taeda (loblolly pine) forests. Schindler
et al. (1980) compared two burned watersheds to a con-
trol and found that fire increased NO32 leaching in one
burned watershed but not the other. The authors con-
cluded that fire-accelerated nutrient losses would not
affect site fertility or stream ecology. Adams and Atti-
will (1991) found no increase in NO32 leaching losses
following a logging plus burning treatment in Tasma-
nia. Chorover et al. (1994) observed increases in stream-
water NO32 following surface fire in a mixed-conifer
forest; however, N losses were much smaller than in-
puts from wet deposition. Our results corroborate those
above suggesting that light intensity fires do not neces-
sarily increase NO32 leaching from forests.
Deep soil concentrations (Figs. 4–6) and annual leach-
ing losses (Table 1) of organic N were similar to that of
NO32. Organic N can be released in large quantities
from decomposing litter (Fahey et al. 1985; Qualls et al.
1991; Northup et al. 1995) and concentrations in deep
soil lysimeters or stream water are frequently as high or
higher than inorganic N concentrations (Gosz 1980; Sol-
lins & McCorison 1981; Parsons et al. 1994; Hedin et al.

1995; Lowrance et al. 1985). While organic N is typically
an important fraction of N leached from forest ecosys-
tems, organic N losses from our site and many of the
sites discussed above were not large enough to greatly
impact the total N stock within the ecosystem
Total nutrient losses from our site showed patterns
similar to those of the inorganic and organic constitu-
ents described above (Table 1). There were no statistical
differences among treatments and we do not consider
the 0.1–0.2 kg N/ha/yr increase in total N losses from
the restoration treatments to be biologically significant.
Net N mineralization rates at this site are 25–35 kg N/
ha/yr in the restoration treatments and soil total N
stocks (forest floor 1 0 to 15 cm mineral soil) are z1500
kg N/ha (Kaye & Hart 1998).
Several mechanisms may have contributed to the low
nutrient losses from our restoration and control treat-
ments. Previous research suggests that when plant re-
growth is slow or experimentally prevented following
disturbance, nutrient losses can be large (Likens et al.
1969; Hibbert et al. 1974; Knight et al. 1991). More pro-
ductive ecosystems tend to lose more N than less pro-
ductive ecosystems following disturbance (Vitousek et
al. 1982). Microbial immobilization and plant uptake of
N are important factors controlling N loss (Coats et al.
1976; Vitousek & Matson 1985), but abiotic retention of
N in soils may also mitigate N loss (Magill et al. 1997).
We found decreased gross microbial immobilization of
NO32 in our restoration treatments, but restoration did
not alter gross microbial immobilization of NH41 (Kaye
& Hart 1998). Because these gross microbial immobili-
zation rates were measured only once in August (when
no water was exported from the site), we cannot rule
out microbial immobilization of N as a mechanism re-
ducing nutrient losses from the restoration treatments.
Increased production by grasses (Fig. 2; Covington et al.
1997) and by trees remaining after thinning may be the
major factors decreasing nutrient losses following pon-
derosa pine restoration.
There are several caveats that should temper extrapo-
lations from our data. First, future research should rep-
licate this work at the site level by measuring nutrient
losses from operational restoration treatments in other

ponderosa pine forests. Second, our data document the
short-term, but not the immediate, disturbance effects
of the restoration treatments. Implementation of the
restoration treatments after the installation of the lysim-
eters would have destroyed many, if not most, of the
lysimeters, so we were unable to collect soil solutions
for immediate post-treatment estimates of nutrient loss.
Consequently, nutrient losses that occurred in the
spring of 1994, following the thinning treatment in the
fall of 1993, were not measured. The prescribed burn
occurred in the fall of 1994, but the hydrologic model
estimated that no water left the site between the fall of
1994 and January 1995. Nutrient concentrations in soil
solution below the rooting zone from January through
March 1995 (data not shown) were similar to those
shown in Figure 3, suggesting that we did not miss a
pulse of nutrient loss resulting from the prescribed
burn.
Conclusions
Nutrient losses following ecological restoration of this
ponderosa pine forest appear to be small because: (1)
nutrient concentrations in the soil below the rooting
zone are low; and (2) water outflow from the ecosystem
by deep percolation is low and temporally limited.
Consequently, ecological restoration will likely not
cause significant changes in stream water chemistry or
terrestrial nutrient stocks because of increased nutrient
losses by leaching. Increased production by grasses and
residual trees following restoration are the most likely
mechanisms for nutrient retention. Coupling measure-
ments of nutrient concentrations in the deep soil solu-
tion using tension lysimetry with a hydrologic model
appears to be a viable method for determining nutrient
losses from restoration experiments that do not meet
the criteria for the small watershed nutrient budget ap-
proach.
