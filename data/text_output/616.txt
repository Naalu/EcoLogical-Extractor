ABSTRACT--Dense 
stands o! slow-growing ponderosa 
pines responded significantly to release. Forty-three-year-old 
stands, with an average stand density o! 5,844 stems per 
acre and average dbh ol 2.6 inches, were thinned in 1962 to 
test six resMual growing stock levels (GSL) with numerical 
indices representing tuture basal areas in sq. It. per acre 
ranging Irom 30 to 150. Net dbh periodic annual increment 
(PAl) 
was 4.6 times greater at GSL-30 and 2.2 times 
greater at GSL-150 during the first five years alter thinning 
than the pre-thinning rate. The net PAl in terms o! square 
toot basal area and cubic /oot volume increased signifi- 
cantly with increased GSL up to GSL-80, and then tapered 
o1• or decreased with increased GSL. Height increased in- 
significantly with increased stand density. Crown width 
increased most on trees in the lowest density stands. The 
PAl o! the 100 largest trees per acre showed improvement 
in diameter, basal area and volume with increasing growing 
space. 
F'orest management 
in Arizona and New Mexico is 
seriously hampered by the present stand structure and 
the slow growth rates of dense young stands. A shortage 
of large poles and small sawtimber restricts the silvicul- 
tural treatments a manager can apply to many stands, 
while the slow growth rates limit the pulpwood cuts he 
can make on approximately 3 million acres of commer- 
cial ,timberlands. 
Most of ,the young stands are too 
dense and yields are too small to entice pulpwood 
operators. 
Past thinning studies have provided some tentative

Residual 
densities 
were

good 
yield data. Earlier studies indicated that diameter incre-

was 
10 to 280

greater 
in lighter 
stands 
than in the heavier 
ones,

wore off too 
soon. Results from the current Taylor Woods levels of

The Taylor Woods 
Study 
Six growing 
stock 
levels 
(GSL) 
are being 
tested 
in 
the 
Fort 
Valley 
Experimental 
Forest 
in A•zona: 
30, 
60, •80, 100, 120, and 150. These 
GSLs are the 
square-foot 
basal areas 
per acre that the residual 
stands 
have, or will have, when the stand diameter is 10 
inches or more." The actual residual square-foot basal 
areas for stands with average diameters less than 10 
inches can be determined from curves in Fig. 2. Each 
growing stock level was replicated 3 times on the 
90-acre Taylor Woods tract. 
The tract was covered mainly with 43-year-old pon- 
derosa pines of the 1919 seedling year. Pretreatment 
inventory of the 18 GSL plots showed an average 
stocking of 5,844 stems per acre. Under these crowded 
conditions diameter growth has been extremely slow. 
Over 80 percent of the trees were less than 3 inches in 
diameter. Only 6 percen.t of the stems had grown .to 
merchantable size of 6 inches in 43 years. The average 
site index of the Taylor Woods tract is 88 compared to 
the regional average of 55. 
The stands were marked and thinned in September 
and October 1962. All remaining trees were tagged, 
measured, and described. Thinning slash was lopped 
and scattered. 
The Taylor Woods GSL Study is one in a series to be 
installed in the West. These regional studies will evalu- 
ate .growth response on different site-quality lands and 
different size-class 
stands. Each plot is to be remeasured 
at five-year intervals, and is tentatively scheduled for 
rethinning at 10-year intervals while each study is to 
run for a period of 20 years.

Results and Discussion 
The young, stagnated ponderosa pines have respond- 
ed rapidly to thinning without serious losses. Heavy, 
wet snows in the spring of 1965 severely bent and 
broke 12 percent of the trees. These damaged trees 
averaged 2 inches smaller in diameter and 8 feet 
shorter in height than the residual stand. The severely 
damaged trees were cut before the start of the third 
growing season. Removal of these trees, as-well as eight 
that were killed the first year by pine engraver beetles, 
reduced basal area stocking an average of 2.8 square 
feet. Because of these losses, the stands a.t the three 
lowest density levels were understocked by 0.1 to 3.4 
square feet; those in the stands at the three highest 
levels, 'by 7.3 to 8.9 square feet. Part of ,this understock- 
ing resulted from the tree removal, and part from the 
increase in average stand diameter which raised the 
basal area requirement for full stocking (Fig. 2). 
Removal of damaged trees before the start of the 
third growing season probably had little, if any, .impact 
on growth of the residual trees. Only trees in GSL-30 
stands showed increased ring width the first year after 
thinning (Fig. 3). Trees in stands at GSL-100 to 150 
showed very little change in ring width until the third 
year after thinning.

Bent trees were remeasured with a diameter tape 
before .they were cut, but differences from 1962 were 
too small or variable 
to evaluate 
increment 
for .the 
two-year period. Therefore, all periodic annual incre- 
ments (PAI) reported in this paper have been adjusted 
to the live tree base in 1967, and indicate net change 
for the five-year period 1962-1967. 
Annual diameter growth was greatest at the lowest 
stand densities during the first five years (Table 1). 
Trees at GSL-30 grew 1.37 inches compared to 0.64 
inch at GSL-150 during these five years. And growth at 
GSL-150 
was twice that of the unthinned 
stand. The 
100 largest trees for all GSL's averaged only 0.03 inch 
more diameter growth per year than the entire stand 
and had about the same relationship 
with stand density. 
Tree height showed an insignificant increase in 
growth rate with decreased stand density (Table 1). 
Height increment was more variable for the 100 largest 
trees. 
Net basal area increment increased throughout the 
density range of GSL-30 to 150, but not as fast at 
GSL's above 80 (Table 1 ). The impact of stand density 
was more apparent on the 100 largest trees. The basal 
area PAl for the largest trees increased sharply with 
increasing growing space at the highest densities, then 
continued to increase at a more moderate, nearly 
uniform rate to the lowest GSL. This increased growth 
rate was also apparent for the entire stand; the basal 
area PAI appears to have reached a plateau at a 
residual basal area above 60 square feet. The actual 
basal area for GSL-120 was 67.2 square feet in 1967, 
and for GSL-150 
it was 71.54. 
Total growth increased with stand density except for 
GSL-150 (Table 1), which was about 4 cubic feet per 
acre less than at GSL-120. 
Since annual •otal volume 
increment for the four highest growing stock levels 
ranged from 50 to 55 cub!c feet per acre, net PAI was 
essentially the same at GSL-80 to GSL-150. Total cubic 
foot volume increment for the 100 largest trees did not 
differ significantly for GSL-30 through GSL-120, but 
did drop a significant amount at GSL-150. 
PAI of merchantable volume increased significantly 
for growing stock levels up to 80, but was quite variable 
at higher stocking levels (Table 1). Most of this 
variability resul.ted ,from differences in number of trees 
below 6 inches in diameter and their slower growth 
rates into merchantable sizes. Therefore, merchantable 
volume PAI should stabilize after the majority of trees 
exceed 6 inches in diameter. The PAI of merchantable 
volume for the 100 largest trees was about the same for 
GSL-30 to GSL-60 and then decreased slightly with 
increased stand density. This suggests 
that competition 
was not a factor below GSL-60. 
Crown widths were widest and growth rates greatest 
at the three lowest stand densities (Fig. 4). Although 
crown widths varied significantly by stand density in 
1967 but not in 1962, growth differences were not 
statistically significant. Individual crown widths in 1962 
and the subsequent growth varied too much to show 
significance. Crown width growth of the largest trees

was only about 0.1 foot more than the average for all 
trees. 
Canopy cover was estimated by mul,tiplying the 
average crown width by the number of trees within 
each growing stock level. These estimated values 
showed a significant increase with increased density 
during ,the first five years (Fig. 5). Six of .the nine plots 
thinned to GSL-100 or higher were estimated to have 80 
percent or more canopy cover in 1967. None of these

nine plots had more than 62 percent canopy cover in 
1962. If the current estimated growth continues, most 
of the stands thinned to GSL-80 or higher will have 
complete canopy closure by 1972. 
Summary and Conclusions 
Young ponderosa pines in northern Arizona have 
responded rapidly to thinning without serious losses. 
Heavy wet snows .two years after thinning caused the 
heaviest losses. Snows have bent a few trees since then, 
but no serious damage occurred, even during the record 
snowfall in December 1967. 'Pine engraver beetles have 
killed only eigh• trees. Porcupines have caused no 
mortality, but continue to damage about 2 percent of 
the trees each year. 
Thinning over the range of growing stock levels 
tested at Taylor Woods has increased the periodic 
annual diameter increment .to four times that of the 
unthinned stand. Before thinning, the trees averaged 
over 33 rings per inch. After thinning, the trees aver- 
aged seven rings per inch at GSL-30, 10 rings at GSL- 
80, and 15 rings at GSL-150. 
Total and merchantable periodic annual volume in- 
crement was increased considerably by thinning. Fur- 
thermore, the growth was concentrated on fewer and 
better quality trees. Before thinning, the stand averaged 
43.5 cubic feet total volume increment per acre per 
year on about 6,000 trees. After thinning, stands at 
GSL-80 and higher averaged 50 to 55 cubic feet on 
288 to 607 trees per acre. Stands at GSL-60 averaged 
42 cubic feet--8 
to 13 cubic .feet less than for the 
higher levels--but it was concentrated 
on 57 to 376 
fewer trees. The ,total cubic foot volume increment at 
GSL-30 was only about one-third of the apparent site 
potential. Similar results were obtained for merchant- 
able volumes. 
Growth of the 100 largest trees per acre gave a good 
indica.tion of the influence of stand density. The largest 
trees, already the fastest growing by virtue of genetic 
superiority or position in the stand, can be made to 
grow even faster by increasing growing space. Basal 
area and volume growth was about the same for both 
all and 100 largest trees at the lowest density since the 
100 largest trees accounted 
for nearly the entire stand. 
At higher densities, 
however, basal area and volume 
differed progressively 
more between these groups with 
increased stand density. As the average stand diameter 
increases, 
greater amounts of the basal area and vol- 
ume growth ,will be on the 100 largest trees. 
Growth during the first five years after thinning 
resulted in an excess of 2.3 .to 10.7 square feet in basal 
area for GSL-30 through GSL-80. Some of the higher 
density plots are still understocked 
according 
.to the 
basal area requirement at the average stand diameter. 
Slower growth at the higher levels has prevented 
these 
plots from overcoming 
the understocked 
conditions 
created by overcutting 
and losses due to snow. 
Taylor Woods is scheduled 
for remeasurement 
and 
thinning in 1972. If growth continues at the current 
rate, eight of the 18 plots will yield over 2 cords of 
pulpwood 
per acre. The stands at GSL-30 are expected 
to bypass 
pulpwood 
production, 
and concentrate 
growth 
on trees intended for sawtimber.
