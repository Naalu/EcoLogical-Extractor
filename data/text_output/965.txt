Introduction 
To meet adaptive management goals under forest plan directives, there is a need to know existing 
conditions in order to 1) measure departure from desired conditions, 2) prioritize where active 
management is needed, and 3) measure treatment effectiveness or environmental trends toward 
desired conditions. In 2014, the Kaibab National Forest (KNF) partnered with the Lab of 
Landscape Ecology and Conservation Biology (LCI) at Northern Arizona University (NAU) to 
pilot a rapid plot protocol that would provide a citizen-science friendly, flexible, and adaptable 
approach to fulfilling forest monitoring needs. In 2017, the Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI) 
collected additional data for the KNF to provide additional baseline information, test an updated 
protocol, and support adaptive management of the Land and Resource Management Plan for the 
Kaibab National Forest, referred to as the forest plan.  
A primary objective of this project was to consolidate 2014 and 2017 KNF monitoring data, 
which had been stored in multiple locations, including the Forest Service Field Sampled 
Vegetation (FSVeg) database and a number of Excel spreadsheets. By organizing the ground plot 
data in a single database it is readily available for analysis, and future monitoring data can be 
added as it is collected. This report summarizes the 2014 and 2017 data across and within veg 
classes and connects ground plot data to KNF desired conditions and monitoring questions. 
Methods 
Data Collection 
Data was collected using a rapid plot protocol, adapted from the rapid forest assessment method 
(Davis et al. 2015). The LCI originally piloted this protocol for the KNF in 2014 (Ray et al. 
2012, Horncastle and Dickson 2014) to determine costs and make recommendations based on 
lessons learned. Additional rapid plots were added as part of a cooperation between the ERI and 
the KNF in 2017 as a supplement, with the intent of establishing robust baseline data for forest 
plan monitoring. A full description of the data collection methods as well as the plot protocol and 
data sheets are in the appendices of this report and in the 2018 ERI report to the KNF (Waltz et 
al. 2018).  
Changes to Plot Protocol 
In 2015, the original rapid plot protocol was adapted to fit both KNF forest monitoring needs and 
4FRI multi-party monitoring needs to allow for across-forest comparisons and summaries. This 
alignment, combined with learning over the first two years of rapid plot data collection, led to 
several changes in the rapid plot protocol. The differences between the 2014 and 2017 protocols 
are detailed in this section and summarized in Table 1.

The plot size for the original KNF rapid plot, collected in 2014, was 0.1747 acres (706.86 sq m). 
By 2017, the collaboratively developed rapid plot protocol was using a 0.2-acre plot.  
In 2014, overstory tree data was collected in diameter classes and trees were tallied according to 
their diameter class (e.g., 10 trees in the 10–20 cm class, 10 in the 20–30cm class, etc.). Trees 
over 40cm were measured to the tenth centimeter. To fit this data in the database with the 2015–
2017 rapid plot data, each tree was given a record in Access with a diameter that corresponded to 
the midpoint of its diameter class. Diameters were also converted to inches, as follows in Table 
2.

For the 2014 protocol, snags over 45 cm were tallied, and no diameter was taken. We used a 
stand-in diameter 17.7 inches so snags could be entered into the database. The 2017 protocol 
measured all trees over 4 inches to the tenth inch. The 2014 protocol included recording the 
presence of trees with Keen Class 4 characteristics. When these were recorded (there were only 7 
instances in the 2014 data set), we interpreted that to be pre-settlement characteristics of the 
largest PIPO on the plot (for all but one of these plots, there was only one tree over 15.75 inches 
(40 cm) recorded on the plot). The 2017 protocol included collecting data on condition class and 
identifying pre-1876 trees; this is unique to the 2017 data ERI collected for the KNF and is not 
part of the rapid plot protocol used for 4FRI monitoring. 
According to the 2014 protocol, ground cover was categorized as forb (F), grass (G), shrub (S), 
fern (FE), crust (C), bare soil (B), rock (R), litter (L). These differ slightly from the current 
protocol, which records forb, grass, shrub, bare soil, rock, litter, moss, and wood. Wood and 
moss were recorded in 2014 despite not being in the protocol. The 2017 rapid plot protocol 
collects both substrate cover and vegetative cover, which the 2014 protocol only recorded one 
observation that we interpreted to be substrate cover. 
Litter and duff were collected as part of the 2014 protocol, this was not included in the 2017 
protocol. Both years collected downed logs, but 2014 included a Brown’s transect approach, 
recording the approximate length, diameter, and decay class for logs across a transect. The 2017 
protocol tallied logs that are over 12 inches in diameter, over 8 feet in length, and not decayed 
(sound wood). We did not compare these two data sets given the different sampling methods.  
Invasive species data was also collected as part of the both protocols. Like the current rapid plot 
protocol, only presence in number of quadrants was recorded for non-native species in 2014, but 
slightly different species were recorded compared to 2017. The 2017 protocol included 
observations of disturbance such as soil compaction, erosion, fire, and grazing. Some of these 
disturbances were recorded qualitatively in the 2014 data.  
Data Management 
Data collected by LCI in 2014 was stored in an Excel spreadsheet. Data collected by ERI in 2017 
was stored in FSVeg and a companion Excel spreadsheet in the field, with paper data sheets as a 
backup option. The two years of data were combined into one Access database in 2019. Changes 
were made to the 2014 LCI data to manage errors and adapt the data to fit with the more recent 
rapid plot data that had been collected for the Kaibab. There was no metadata associated with the 
2014 KNF data. Assumptions made and the resulting changes to the data are detailed below. 
Unknown spruce species (“PISP spruce spp”) were tallied on 28 plots 2014 plots (All North 
Kaibab — 242, 279, 228, 370, 234, 235, 241, 270, 366, 278, 358, 364, 367, 369, 375, 377, 229, 
237, 239, 363, 368, 372, 374, 268, 365, 379, 232, 376). These were assumed to be Picea 
engelmannii (PIEN). One plot had trees recorded as PL spp (North Kaibab 227). There are no 
3

known local native species with the genus beginning “Pl-.” These trees were also assumed to be 
PIEN. 
When tree data were missing for a plot that had data collected otherwise (e.g., GPS points, plot 
level info), we assumed there were no trees at the plot. One plot was missing data for trees over 
40 cm (Williams 138). The data indicated there were six trees in the >40 cm size class, but did 
not provide the measurements for the trees, so 15.75 inches (40 cm) was used as the diameter for 
those trees. There were tree data for one plot (Williams 148), for which there were no plot data. 
This plot was excluded.  
The 2014 seedling and sapling tallies were combined into a single tally per species per transect. 
It appears, based on the 2014 data sheet, that any separate seedling and sapling data may have 
been lost when the data was entered into Excel. All tallies were assumed to be seedlings. There 
are no data for saplings (trees <10 cm in dbh) for the 2014 data. 
To match the current rapid plot protocol data, vegetation/substrate transect data from 2014 was 
used exclusively as substrate data. Observations of “log” were changed to wood (W). “Moss” 
was changed to “M.” The 2014 protocol called for noting if lifeforms were live or dead, this 
portion of the data was not analyzed for this report.  
Sampling Strategy 
The original KNF–LCI pilot strategy involved assigning a dominant cover type to each KNF 
stand using broad vegetation classes. Plots were distributed proportionally in each vegetation 
class (Ray et al. 2012). In 2017, sites were selected based on vegetation type and forest 
management planning. All four projects sampled were under contract, and all were in ponderosa 
pine or ponderosa pine–Gamble oak vegetation classifications. These sites were selected using a 
sampling strategy developed for 4FRI monitoring by the Conservation Science Partners (a 
partner firm of LCI) (Gray 2017). Given the different sampling strategies, we did not combine 
the 2017 data with the 2014 data. However, we do present the summary statistic for the 2017 
plots with the 2014 data summary to allow for contrasting across approaches. For reference, the 
Cougar, Coyote, Ham, and Moonset projects all fall within the Williams District. The total 
number of plots per project or district can be found in Table 3, and the number of plots by project 
or district and Region 3 Ecological Response Unit (ERU) can be found in Table 4.

Results 
The results of this report are reported by district (for 2014 data) and project (for 2017 data), and 
Region 3 Ecological Response Unit (ERU). Analysis was done by ERU to match the KNF forest 
plan, but LCI sampling in 2014 was done using a vegetation layer created specifically for that 
project that ERI does not have access to. As a result, there are low sample sizes in some ERUs, 
and this is reflected in the analysis.

Overstory — Trees (Structure and Composition) 
Overstory structure summaries are provided in Tables 6 and 7. Tree species that accounted for 
less than 5 percent of all tree density (trees per acre, TPA) and basal area (BA) across all 
projects, district, and ERUs were removed from our summary. Across the larger 2014 forest 
level sample, trees per acre ranged from as few as 3.4 in the sagebrush shrubland type (Tusayan) 
to 182.5 in the mixed conifer type (Williams). Within the ponderosa pine type, the 2017 unit 
based plots had one and a half to twice the average trees per acre and basal area per acre as the 
plots collected in 2014. It is unclear why there are such large differences in tree densities and 
basal area between the 2014 and 2017 plots.  
Across the larger 2014 forest level sample, basal area ranged from 96.37 ft2/acre in the North 
Kaibab Mixed Conifer-Frequent Fire to 14.58 in sagebrush scrub (Tusayan). There are 
insufficient samples in some ERUs as a result of the sampling using a different vegetation layer. 
The standard error is nearly the same as the mean TPA and mean BA for several ERUs within 
districts. Plot density and standard error should be considered when assessing trends across this 
data. 
A summary of density of snags over 17.7 inches can be found in Table 8. Snag densities are very 
low across districts and ERUs. Similar to the live tree density and basal area, snag density 
measured on the project areas in 2017 is much higher than that of the ponderosa pine plots 
measured in 2014.  
Tree Regeneration 
Seedling densities are summarized in Table 9. Seedling density varied widely across ERUs, with 
a high of 12,700 seedlings per acre in mixed conifer in the Williams district, over double the 
highest seedling density of any other veg type and forest district, and a low of 52.31 in the 
montane/subalpine grassland (Williams). Seedling densities between 5,700 and 1,000 per acre 
were found across districts and ERUs, with the lowest densities (under 1,000 per acre) in 
sagebrush shrubland, pj woodland, and grassland types in some districts. 
Gambel oak accounted for a large proportion of seedling density across many ERUS across 
districts. Ponderosa pine seedlings were found more consistently than other species across 
districts and vegetation types, missing only from some sagebush shrubland, Colorado 
plateau/great basin grassland, and PJ woodland. Despite occurring across most ERUs, ponderosa 
pine was not typically the most abundant seedling species within any combination of district and 
ERU, commonly outnumbered by oak and aspen seedlings. 
Similar to overstory data, there are insufficient samples in some ERUs, as a result of the 
sampling using a different vegetation layer. The standard error is nearly the same as the mean 
seedling density for several ERUs within districts. Plot density and standard error should be 
considered when assessing trends across this data.

Forest Floor Substrate Cover 
Substrate cover is summarized in Table 10. Litter was the most frequent substrate cover across 
districts. In Tusayan and Williams districts, bare soil was the next most frequent. North Kaibab 
had the lowest average bare soil percentage per plot. Grass was the most frequent vegetative 
substrate cover, accounting for between 28.33 percent and 14.38 percent of cover per plot 
depending on the district. We were not able to analyze this data by ERU for this report.

Fine and Woody Fuels 
2014 KNF data collection included litter and duff depths, as well as transects of down woody 
debris. The protocol also says that there were supposed to be Photoload estimates, which were 
not provided for this analysis. The summary of litter and duff estimates are in Table 11. We were 
unable to process the data for down woody debris in time for this report.

Invasive Herbaceous Presence 
Invasive species data is summarized in Table 12. Thistle species and cheatgrass were the most 
frequently observed invasive species across the 2014 data. Thistle species were more common 
than cheatgrass in the North Kaibab and Williams plots, while cheatgrass was the most common 
in the Tusayan plots.  
It is unclear if invasive species data from 2014 is complete. For example, Tusayan only has 
invasive data for 10 plots. We were unable to discern if this data were only collected for those 
plots, if data are missing, or if those plots that are missing did not have invasive species on them. 
Additionally, species codes from 2014 data are unclear. Educated guesses were made as to the 
matching species, but the codes did not correspond to known species codes. We were unable to 
analyze this data by ERU for this report.

Disturbance Indicators 
Disturbance data collected in 2014 was recorded as presence/absence and was qualitative. If 
disturbance was present, field staff made a note of what it was in the plot notes. Most disturbance 
noted was “wildfire,” sometimes notes on severity were provided, but most often not. There was 
one observation of erosion across all plots.  
Discussion 
The following questions were identified in the Kaibab National Forest Plan as those to be 
answered by rapid plot data. Here we matched the existing data as closely as possible with the 
appropriate monitoring questions.   
Are snags, downed logs and large old trees at desired levels at the midscale (100–1,000 acre 
average)? 
Across districts and ERUs, snag observations are very low. The plot size is likely too small to 
adequately capture snags as a more uncommon feature on the landscape. It is unclear why there 
is such a distinct difference between snag densities from 2014 to 2017. 
Is the coarse woody debris within the desired range? 
The Photoload and down woody debris transects were not analyzed for this report. 
Does height to live crown and crown bulk density put the forest at risk for uncharacteristic high 
severity fire at the mid-scale and above? 
This question is not directly answered by the rapid plot protocol, but rapid plot data could be 
used to model height to live crown and crown bulk density to provide helpful guidance to forest 
staff.  
Is regeneration occurring at a rate that will support uneven-aged forests over time? 
Calculating regeneration rate requires multiple years of data across the same plots. As our 2017 
data was not collected to be compared to the 2014 data, we are not able to estimate regeneration 
rate at this time. The natural range seedling regeneration rate for ponderosa pine in the ponderosa 
13

pine ERU is 0.10–8.9 seedlings per acre per decade (Mast et al. 1999). The observed PIPO 
seedling density for all districts in this ERU is well above the natural range.  
What is the percent of effective ground cover? What is the proportion of live and dead 
vegetation, litter, rock, and bare ground? 
Vegetation covered approximately one-quarter of the substrate on average in the North Kaibab, 
less than one-quarter of the substrate in Tusayan, and approximately one-third of the substrate in 
Williams. These are rough estimations, as adding together the averages of live substrate classes 
(forb, shrub, moss, grass, fern, and crust) is not a statistically sound approach. We were not able 
to differentiate between live and dead vegetation for this analysis, as observations of live and 
dead vegetation were lumped when the 2014 data were analyzed. 
Non-vegetative and litter cover was greater than vegetative cover. Litter accounted for an 
average of 49.79 percent of substrate cover per plot for the North Kaibab, 44.58 percent per plot 
in Tusayan, and 35.34 percent per plot in Williams. Rock accounted for an average of 13.06 
percent of substrate cover per plot in the North Kaibab, 15.05 percent in the Tusayan, and 14.38 
percent in the Williams district. There was an average of 7.7 percent bare soil per plot for North 
Kaibab, 18.8 percent per plot for Tusayan, and 16.4 percent per plot for Williams district.  
Is there evidence of erosion (pedastalling of vegetation or rock, rills, sheet flow, or deposition)? 
The 2014 data does not answer this question. The protocol does call  collection of soil 
disturbance data, but there are only minimal qualitative observations of compaction (mostly old 
roads) in the plot-level data. This could possibly be answered by the 2017 data and current rapid 
plot protocol, but it may not be detailed enough to be helpful. 
What is the percentage and pattern of plots that have evidence of soil disturbance from activities 
that used mechanical equipment? 
The 2014 data does not answer this question. While the protocol does call for collection of soil 
disturbance data, there are minimal observations with insufficient detail to adequately analyze. 
This question cannot be answered currently by the rapid plot protocol. While the current rapid 
plot protocol includes observations of soil disturbance, the cause of disturbance is not recorded. 
Furthermore, our experience with the rapid plot protocol and training relatively inexperienced 
field staff is that they have difficult discerning details such as these.  
What is the frequency of area occupied by noxious weeds by species? 
This question cannot be answered currently by the rapid plot protocol. The 2014 and 2017 
protocols did not account for frequency or extent within each quadrant of the plot (e.g., one 
individual of an invasive species in a single quadrant of the plot gets a count of 1, and 1,000 
individuals over the entire extent of the quadrant also gets a count of 1).

Recommendations 
Data intensification and role for KNF forest planning: 4FRI projects on the KNF (2017) were 
sampled at higher intensities to address management effectiveness in proposed treatments areas. 
The work done in 2015–19 by LCI/CSP both for the KNF and the 4FRI monitoring did create a 
sampling algorithm for expected densification, and the KNF has collected rapid plot data outside 
of project areas to support forest plan monitoring.  
Intensifying plot sampling design can inform overall plan monitoring in some cases. If the data 
collected from intensified plots are not significantly different, for the variables of interest, from 
the forest plan set of plots, the data can be combined. However, initial examination showed that 
the task order plot data collected in 2017 had consistently higher forest density and basal area in 
the ponderosa pine vegetation type. Error checking was done to ensure conversions were 
appropriate, however further work could be done to elucidate why there was such a consistent 
difference in forest density. Often, treatments focus on the stands that are the most departed from 
the natural range of variability. The task orders may represent a subset of the most dense 
ponderosa pine forest on the KNF. The forest level questions and the need for resampling should 
be examined for future data collection. 
Data accessibility: As reviewed in the ERI 2018 report to the KNF, data for forest plan and 
collaborative project monitoring are best utilized when data is stored in one easily accessible and 
shareable database. Collaborative partners and Forest Service staff working on the 4FRI 
monitoring have identified that maintaining monitoring data in the Forest Service corporate 
databases has a number of barriers to accomplishing effective storage, management, use, and 
sharing of this data (Waltz et al. 2018). While forest plan monitoring is intended for a Forest 
Service audience and “self-check,” there is a similar collaborative need across Forest Service 
resource areas, that is inhibited by storing forest plan monitoring data in existing corporate 
databases. 
Monitoring Capacity and Methodology Consistencies: There is significant pressure within 
federal agencies to increase monitoring efficiencies across resource areas. However, with 
consistently scarce resources for monitoring, it is difficult to invest sufficient human resources to 
meet monitoring guidelines and timelines at leadership levels, as well as to vet protocols and 
approaches at the technical level to meet these efficiency needs. Forest plan monitoring is a 
commitment to long-term trend analysis, with engagement from Forest Service resources for data 
collection and incorporation into planning areas. It additionally requires the use of consistent 
sampling protocol to measure indicators through time. This report highlights the difficulties of 
analyzing trend analysis across multiple years with changing protocols, changing sub-
contractors, and variable error-checking processes. Leadership intent and support for early 
investment in monitoring programs, with dedicated staff and engagement of technical expertise, 
could significantly increase effectiveness of incorporating monitoring data into adaptive 
management recommendations.  
Forest plan monitoring with the rapid plot protocol has had mixed results. Changes in protocols 
have been a necessary evil as the approach to rapid plot monitoring has been adjusted and 
15

improved. In addition, the 2012 Planning Rule allows for adaptive management, particularly if 
monitoring questions and/or indicators are found to be inappropriate for the resource being 
monitored. However, changes have significantly impacted the ease with which these data can be 
stored and analyzed. Federal land managers need to invest in the technical capacity to manage 
any monitoring protocol changes for only the most strategic reasons, while accommodating the 
cost to data management.

Appendix A – Expanded Methods 
We used a rapid plot protocol, which was adapted from the rapid forest assessment method 
(Davis et al. 2015) and originally piloted for the Kaibab National Forest by the Lab of Landscape 
Ecology and Conservation Biology at Northern Arizona University (NAU) in 2012 (Ray et al. 
2012). The protocol is designed to address Kaibab NF forest plan monitoring questions as well as 
4FRI project-level monitoring questions. Using an oversample created by Conservation Science 
Partners (CSP) for monitoring across the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI), a spatially 
balanced sample was placed across the four treatment units. Based on the power analysis 
completed by CSP (Gray 2017), recommended sample intensity to detect significant changes in 
total basal area and mean diameter at breast height was 1 plot per 50 acres.  
Data was collected on paper forms and electronically on tablets with Microsoft Excel and the 
Forest Service ExamsPC program. The plot location data, tree list (including seedling and 
sapling transect data), ground and vegetation transect data, and reference tree information was 
recorded in ExamsPC. Because of the limitations of the Forest Service FSVeg database, all other 
data was recorded in an Excel spreadsheet. Paper worksheets ensured completion of the plot 
protocol by providing a checklist, provided space to prepare data for electronic entry, and created 
a paper record in case of problems with electronic data entry.  
Complete protocol and data forms can be found in Appendix A. In general, plots were 0.2-acre, 
fixed-radius plots for overstory measurements and assessing wildlife and invasive 
presence/absence. Smaller sample units were used for tree regeneration densities, fuels estimates, 
and grass, forb, shrub and substrate frequency. The protocol borrows heavily from Ray et al. 
2012 and Davis et al. 2016. 
Key variables in rapid plot monitoring tier directly to the Kaibab Forest Monitoring Plan, and the 
addition of presettlement assessments were included to meet ERI objectives. Plot variables 
include: 
●
Overstory structure and composition
○
Estimated overstory presettlement structure and composition (ERI)
●
Forest floor substrate frequency
●
Grass, forb and shrub frequency
●
Fine and woody fuels
●
Invasive herbaceous presence
●
Disturbance and Wildlife indicators: log density, small mammal evidence
Plot Layout 
The plot was a 105.33-ft diameter circle (0.2-acre). Once the center of the plot was determined, 
two transects (100-ft tapes) were laid out perpendicularly in the cardinal directions through the 
center. For more precise remeasurement, plot centers were monumented in the field using rebar, 
and a reference tree was tagged, and dbh, distance and azimuth to plot center were recorded. 
Overall plot condition was documented using two photos; one taken from the northern endpoint 
of the north‐south transect and one taken from the eastern endpoint of the east-west transect.  
18

Overstory — Trees 
Within the entire plot, we measured all live and dead trees taller than breast height (i.e., 4.5 ft.) 
and greater than 4 inches dbh to the nearest tenth centimeter using a diameter tape. A hypsometer 
or an extra tape measure was used to determine whether trees near the circle boundary were 
within the plot. The following data were recorded: species, dbh, and condition (i.e., live or dead), 
condition class [(1) live; (2) declining; (3) recent snag; (4) loose bark snag; (5) clean snag; (6) 
snag broken above breast height; (7) snag broken below breast height; (8) downed dead tree; (9) 
cut stump; and (10) stump hole]. The condition class categories were derived from snag 
decomposition studies (Thomas et al. 1979). On the Coconino Plateau, the last wide-spread fire 
year is documented as 1876 (Moore and Covington 1994); this date was used for approximate 
date when natural processes were intact. All living and dead trees potentially old and/or large 
enough to have become established prior to 1876 were identified as potentially pre-1876 trees in 
the field. Ponderosa pines of any size with yellowed bark (White 1985), flat-tops, or lower 
branches with large bark plates, as well as all oaks, junipers, and pinyon trees >7 in at dbh 
(Barger and Folliott 1972) were considered potentially pre-1876 trees.  
The height of three co-dominant trees (which represented the average height of the trees within 
plot) were recorded and those trees were tagged. The three lowest canopy base heights were 
recorded. 
Understory — Tree Regeneration and Shrubs, Grasses, and Forbs 
Seedlings and saplings were counted by species within four, 6-feet-by-45-feet transects along the 
directional transect tapes (0.025-acre). Trees shorter than breast height (4.5 ft.) were considered 
seedlings, trees taller than breast height and smaller than 4 inches in dbh were considered 
saplings.  
Forest floor substrate cover and vegetative frequency by functional group and were recorded 
using the point-line intercept method (Elzinga et al. 2001, Herrick et al. 2009) along the north 
and east transects. Starting at the end of a transect, a pointer (e.g., pin flag or chaining pin) was 
lowered every 2 feet along the transect to record all vegetation hits below 19.7 in, stopping at the 
first layer of ground cover (i.e., litter, grass, forb, bare soil, shrub, tree, woody debris, rock, and 
moss/lichen). Substrate cover was calculated using only the final substrate hit, and substrate 
cover totals 100 percent. The intercepted vegetation above substrate was also tallied as a 
frequency, totals can exceed 100 percent as each point may have multiple interceptions. The 
percent cover for substrate, and frequency of vegetative types were calculated for the plot based 
on the total of 46 points. These data characterize forest floor conditions, including exposed 
mineral soils, amount of litter, and frequency of plant functional types. 
Fine and Woody Fuels 
To quantify fine woody fuels (1-, 10-, and 100-hour fuels), we used the photoload sampling 
technique developed by Keane and Dickinson (2007) based on known fuel loads within the 
Rocky Mountains. Three feet from the end of each transect, we placed a 10.76-ft2 square frame 
(e.g., polyvinyl chloride piping) on the ground and compared the dead woody fuels with those in 
existing photos of known fuel quantities from Keane and Dickinson (2007). For each fuel size 
class, the values are binned further into 5 classes (0, 0–1.8, 1.8–4.5, 4.5–9.0, and 9.0 tons/acre). 
19

An estimate of woody fuels across the stand was estimated also estimated using the photoload 
sampling technique, comparing field conditions to photos of known fuel quantities from Keane 
and Dickinson (2007) and from Scott and Burgan (2005). 
Invasive Herbaceous Presence, Disturbance, and Wildlife Indicators 
Field crews recorded presence and absence data for erosion and compaction as indicators of soil 
disturbance, evidence of recent (with 1 year) fire, and evidence of grazing (cow pies). The 
number of plot quadrants (i.e., 1–4) with the presence of disturbance.  
The number of plot quadrants with invasive herbaceous species presence was also recorded. 
Field crews were instructed to look for 11 invasive species identified by the Kaibab National 
Forest as most noxious and likely to be present. These species were Russian thistle, other 
invasive thistle species (bull thistle, Canada thistle, musk thistle, scotch thistle, and yellow 
starthistle) cheatgrass, knapweed species (Russian, spotted, and diffuse knapweeds), dalmatian 
toadflax, and “other” species (leafy spurge).  
The number of logs over 12 inches in diameter and 8 feet long that are within the plot were 
tallied. The presence and absence of squirrel sign (stripped cones and twigs, and/or clippings) 
and/or vole runways was recorded at the plot level.
