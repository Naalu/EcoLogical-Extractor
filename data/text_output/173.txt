Abstract 
Differences in competitive ability may explain the maintenance of existing plant populations and the invasion of 
new areas by plant species. We used field experiments to examine the competitive responses of Agropyron cris­
tatum (L.) Gaertn., an introduced C 3 grass, and Bouteloua gracilis (HBK.) Lag., a native C 4 grass, and the com­
petitive effects of Agropyron-dominated vegetation and successional prairie. We also tested whether the outcome 
of competitive interactions varied with water availability. In each vegetation type. transplants of each species 
were grown under two levels of competition (presence or absence of neighboring vegetation) and three levels of 
water availability (high. medium, or low). Transplant survival, growth. and biomass allocation patterns were 
measured. Water availability had no effect on the measured variables, suggesting that both species were limited 
by another resource. Growth rates were affected more by competition, while survival and root: shoot ratio were 
affected more by transplant species identity. In the successional prairie, neighboring vegetation suppressed the 
growth of Agropyron transplants less than that of Bouteloua transplants, suggesting that Agropyron has a stronger 
ability to resist competitive suppression in that vegetation type. The spread of Agropyron into surrounding veg­
etation may relate to its ability to resist competitive suppression. In the Agropyron-dominated vegetation, neigh­
boring vegetation suppressed the growth of both species by the same extent. However, competition accounted for 
more variation in transplant growth in Agropyron-dominated vegetation than in successional prairie, suggesting 
that Agropyron has strong competitive effects which hinder plant growth and prevent other species froin estab­
lishing in Agropyron fields.

transplants to about the same extent as it suppressed 
transplants of Bouteloua gracilis (HBK .) Lag., a C4 
grass native to the northern Great Plains of North 
America (Gerry and Wilson 1995). 
We hypothesized 'that introduced and native 
grasses would differ in competitive ability and that 
these differences would be evident in their growth and 
biomass allocation patterns. To test this hypothesis, 
we used field experiments to examine the competitive 
responses of Agropyron and Bouteloua transplants 
and the competitive effects of Agropyron-dominated 
vegetation and successional prairie. Transplants were 
used to avoid interspecific differences in germination 
and establishment. 
In environments with limited productivity, most 
competition occurs for below ground resources such 
as water and mineral nutrients (Casper and Jackson 
1997). In the northern Great Plains , primary produc­
tion is strongly correlated with precipitation (Sala et 
al. 1988), suggesting that water is a limiting resource 
in this region. In addition, interspecific differences in 
water use efficiency, ontogenetic patterns (Morgan et 
al. 1998), 'and response to summer drought (Frank 
1994) suggest that species should respond differently 
to water availability. We hypothesized that water 
availability would affect the outcome of competitive 
interactions. We used high, medium, and low levels 
of water availability to test this hypothesis. 
Methods 
Study site 
Grasslands National Park (49°22'N 107°53'W) is lo­
cated in the mixed-grass prairie region of southern 
Saskatchewan, Canada. The vegetation is dominated 
by grasses tBouteloua, Koeleria gracilis Pers., Stipa 
comata Trin . & Rupr.) and spikemoss (Selaginella 
densa Rydb. ; nomenclature follows Barkworth and 
Dewey (1985) for the Triticaceae and Looman and 
Best (1987) for all other taxa). The region has a con­
tinental climate with average temperatures of - 7 °C 
in January and 27°C in July . The average annual pre­
cipitation is 313 nun, 46% of which occurs from May 
through July (Environment Canada 1966--1993). 
Mean temperatures and precipitation levels experi­
enced during the experiment were within one stan­
dard deviation of the long-term (1966-1993) mean. 
The experiment was conducted in a field that had 
been cultivated and abandoned around 1940. After 
abandonment, part of the field was sown with Agro­
pyron and part of it underwent natural succession to 
dominance by native grasses. As a result, the field 
contained two vegetation types (Agropyron-dominat­
ed vegetation and succession al prairie) with similar 
disturbance histories, slopes, and aspects . Soils in the 
field were loam to clay loams. 
Experimental design 
We used root exclusion tubes to restrict the competi­
tive interactions of the transplant to a defined area. 
Each tube (pVC, 10 cm diameter, 15 em length) was 
hammered vertically into the ground until its upper 
edge was I em above the soil surface. Tub es were ar­
ranged in a grid with 3 m spacing. Transplants were 
much smaller (final mass < I g) than the soil mass 
within each tube ( ~ 1 kg). 
Vegetation types were not interspersed, so a sepa­
rate factorial experiment was performed in each type . 
The experimental design consi sted of 2 competition 
levels x 3 water availability levels x 2 transplant spe­
cies. Treatment combinations were replicated 10 
times for a total of 120 tubes per vegetation type. 
Treatments were randomly assigned to tubes. 
Two competition levels were used: AN, with all 
neighbors present, and NN, with no neighbors 
present. Vegetation in AN tubes was not disturbed. 
Vegetation in NN tubes was sprayed with a 1% gly­
phosate [N-(phosphonomethyJ )glycine] solution two 
weeks before seedlings were transplanted. Glyphosate 
degrades rapidly and has no residual activity. Re­
growth of neighboring vegetation was continually re­
moved by hand. 
High, medium, and low levels of water availabil­
ity were calculated as the monthly means of the 4 
wettest, 4 median, and 4 driest summers (May to Au­
gust) in the last 30 years at Val Marie, Saskatchewan 
(about 10 km north of the study site ; Environment 
Canada (1966-1993». Water was applied biweekly 
from May to August 1995 using historical monthly 
precipitation patterns (Figure I). Natural precipitation 
was reduced by positioning a 20 x 20 cm piece of 
colorless Acrylite FF (Johnson Plastics, Winnipeg, 
Manitoba, Canada) 15 em above each tube. Acrylite 
. FF is an acrylic material that transmits 92% of light 
and 89% of solar energy.

Agropyron and Bouteloua seeds were sown in 
April 1995 into pots (2.5 ern diameter, 12 em deep) 
filled with a 3:1 mixture of peat and local topsoil. Af­
ter germination, densities were reduced to one indi­
vidual per pot. Seedlings were grown in a greenhouse 
at the University of Regina, where they received nat­
ural light and daily water. After 5 weeks, seedlings 
were moved outside for a week of hardening. In late 
May 1995, seedlings were brought to the study site 
where one individual was transplanted into the center 
of each tube. All transplants received 31 mm of water 
during transplanting and 28 mm a week later to aid 
establishment, and were shaded for 2 weeks after 
transplanting "to reduce desiccation, Transplants that 
died within 2 weeks of planting were replaced. 
Sampling methodology and analysis 
Initial total transplant mass (Mj ; dry weight in g) was 
calculated using species-specific regressions (Gerry 
and Wilson 1995) with total tiller length (ITL; mm): 
Agropyron:M,=[0.OOO859(ITL)-0.OO174]2;r2 
=0.91;n=1O 
Bouteloua:Mi=[0.OOO796(1TL)+0.00458]2;r2 
=0.98;n=1O 
TIL was defined as the sum of the lengths of the 
longest leaf of each tiller of a transplant and was 
measured before transplanting. The initial transplant 
mass of both species was 0.024 g. The initial root: 
shoot ratios of Agropyron and Bouteloua were 0.99 
and 1.15, respectively. 
Transplants were harvested in mid-September 
1995. Transplant shoots and aboveground neighbor­
ing vegetation were cut and separated, and then each 
tube, with the soil mass encompassed by it, was re­
moved from the ground . After soaking each soil mass, 
the transplant root system was carefully teased, in its 
entirety, from the soil. All remaining roots were as­
sumed to be from neighboring vegetation within the 
tubes. Root samples were washed to remove all soil 
from the surface. All vegetation samples were dried 
to constant mass and weighed . 
The relative growth rate (R) of each transplant was  
calculated as:  
where M, is final total mass, M; is initial total 
mass, and d is the number of days between measur­
ing 1TL and harvest. 
Final transplant root: shoot ratios (R:S) were cal­
culated as: 
R:S=M/M, 
where M, is final root mass and M. is final shoot 
mass. 
Statistical analyses were performed using JMP sta­
tistical software (version 3.0.2; SAS Institute (1994». 
Vegetation types were analyzed separately. Log-like­
lihood ratios tested the effects of competition, water, 
and species on transplant survival to harvest. Three­
way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) tested the ef­
fects of competition, water, species, and all interac­
tions on growth rate and on root: shoot ratio. 
To further examine the effect of competition on 
" transplant 
performance, transplant growth (i.e., 
MIMi) was regressed on aboveground neighbor 
mass in AN tubes. Aboveground neighbor masses 
were log transformed to improve the model fit. Lin­
ear equations were fit to significant (P =0.05) regres­
sions. The 95% confidence limits of the regressions 
were compared to detect significant differences 
among regressions. For each equation, R 2 estimates 
the proportion of variation in transplant growth that 
can be accounted for by aboveground neighbor mass, 
the slope measures the per-gram effect of neighbors 
on transplant growth (Goldberg 1987), and the y-in­
tercept predicts transplant growth in the absence of 
neighbors.

ity. Log-likelihood ratio results in (Table I). 
Comparison of vegetation types 
The species composition of each vegetation type was 
assessed in late July 1995 using eight 0.5 x 1.0 m 
quadrats distributed around the perimeter of each 
study site. In each quadrat, the percent cover of bare 
ground, litter, and each plant species was estimated 
using Daubenmire's scale (Mueller-Dombois and El­
lenberg 1974). The 0-5% class was broken into 0-1 % 
and 1-5% classes to more accurately reflect the im­
portance of smaller and infrequent plants. Species 
richness was calculated for each quadrat. 
Shoot mass was sampled by clipping all vegetation 
1 cm above the soil surface in a 0.1 m2 area at each 
quadrat. Live shoots (the current year's growth) were 
separated from dead shoots. Root mass was sampled 
by pooling three soil cores (2 cm diameter, 10 cm 
depth) per quadrat and washing them to separate roots 
from soil. Live and dead roots could not be separated. 
Shoot and root samples were dried to constant mass 
and weighed . Root: shoot ratios were calculated for 
each vegetation type. 
Differences between vegetation types were tested 
using Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVAs on ranks.

Transplant survival was significantly lower for 
Agropyron than Boute/oua in both vegetation types 
(Figure 2). Survival tended (P ::: 0.056) to be higher 
when neighbors were present in the Agropyron-domi­
nated vegetation but was not affected by the presence 
or absence of neighbors in the successional prairie. 
Interactions were not tested as lack-of-fit tests indi­
cated that including them would not improve the 
model fit. 
Transplant growth rate was significantly lower in 
the presence 'of neighbors in both vegetation types 
(Figure 3). In the Agropyron-dominated vegetation, 
transplant growth rate was significantly higher for 
Bouteloua than Agropyron and the competition x spe­
cies interaction was not significant. In the succes­
sional prairie, the presence of neighbors had a larger 
effect on the growth rate of Bouteloua than Agropy­
ron transplants, producing a significant competition x 
species interaction. Overall, transplant growth rates 
were higher in the Agropyron-dominated vegetation 
than the successional prairie.

Transplant root shoot ratios in both vegetation 
types were significantly higher in the presence of 
neighbors and significantly lower for Bouteloua than 
Agropyron (Figure 4). Competition x species interac­
tions were not significant in either vegetation type. 
Overall, root: shoot ratios were higher in the succes­
sional prairie than the Agropyron.dominated vegeta­
tion. 
Transplant growth was significantly negatively 
correlated with aboveground neighbor mass for both 
species in both vegetation types (Figure 5). Regres­
sion equation s did not differ from one another in slope 
or y-intercept, Aboveground neighbor mass explained 
up to 40% of the variation in transplant growth, but 
explained much less of the variation in Bouteloua 
than Agropyron growth (Figure 5: R2 values). Per­
gram effects tended to be lower for Bouteloua than 
Agropyron (Figure 5: slopes). Predicted and actual 
growth in the absence of neighbors were similar for 
Agropyron (Figure 5: y-intercepts), Predicted growth 
was much lower than actual growth in the absence of 
neighbors for Bouteloua. 
Comparison of vegetation types 
Species richness was significantly higher in succes­
sional prairie than Agropyron-dominated vegetation 
(Table 2). Agropyron cover was significantly higher 
in Agropyron-dominated vegetation. Covers of all 
other plants, of litter, and of bare ground either did 
not differ among vegetation types or were signifi­
cantly higher in successional prairie. 
Live shoot mass was significantly higher in Agro­
pyron-dominated vegetation than successional prairie 
(Table 2). Total root mass was 3-5 times greater than 
live shoot mass but did not differ between vegetation 
types, nor did root: shoot ratio. 
Discussion 
Competition 
The results clearly indicate that competition from 
neighboring vegetation reduced the growth rate and 
increased biomass allocation to belowground struc­
tures in both transplant species. These responses are 
typical of species competing for belowground re­
sources (Casper and Jackson 1997).

Figure 5. Growth of Agropyron and Bouteloua transplants as a 
function of neighbor shoot mass in all neighbor (AN) tubes in 
Agropyron-<lominated vegetation and successional prairie. Data are 
combined across levels of water availability. Lines indicate signif­
icant (P ~ 0.05) regressions. Mean actual growth in no neighbor 
(NN) tubes, shown by the open symbol on the y-axis of each graph, 
was not included in the regressions. 
Competitive responses varied among vegetation 
types. In the successional prairie, competition re­
duced the growth rate of Bouteloua by about 60% and 
that of Agropyron by about a third (Figure 3, right), 
indicating that Agropyron had a stronger ability to re­
sist competitive suppression. In Goldberg (1990) ter­
minology, Agropyron is a relatively strong response 
competitor in this vegetation type. The spread of 
Agropyron into native prairie (Coffin et al. 1996) may 
relate to its ability to resist competitive suppression. 
In contrast, competition in the Agropyron-dominated 
vegetation reduced the growth of both species by 
about half (Figure 3, left), indicating that both spe­
cies were suppressed by about the same extent Simi­
lar result s have been reported when Agropyron and 
Bouteloua were grown with neighboring Bromus in­
ennis, another introduced C 3 grass (Gerry and Wil­
son 1995). Thus, the ability of Agropyron to resist 
competitive suppression does not explain its domi-' 
nance in fields of introduced grasses (Table 2). 
Competitive effects may prevent other species 
from establishing in Agropyron-dominated vegeta­
tion. The F-ratio of the competition term (Table I) 
was twice as large in Agropyron-dominated vegeta­
tion as in successional prairie, suggesting that Agro­
pyron-dominated vegetation has strong competitive 
effects and that competition accounts for more varia­
tion in transplant performance in this vegetation type 
(Underwood and Petrait is 1993). Strong competitive 
effects would explain why Centaurea diffusa Lam., 
an introduced herb, invaded plots of Agropyron at a 
much lower rate than it invaded unseeded plots or 
plots of Elymus junceus Fisch. (Berube and Myers 
1982). 
In the absence of neighbors, Bouteloua transplants 
grew larger (Figure 5) and faster (Figure 3) than 
Agropyron transplants. The large difference between 
predicted and actual growth of Bouteloua in the ab­
sence of neighbors (Figure 5), however, indicates that 
even low amounts of neighbors greatly reduced the 
growth of Bouteloua. The first few neighbors appear 
to have a disproportionately large competitive effect 
on Bouteloua. In contrast, the predicted and actual 
growth of Agropyron in the absence of neighbors 
were very similar (Figure 5), suggesting that all 
neighbors had a proportionate effect on Agropyron. 
This result supports the conclusion that Agropyron 
was less suppressed by neighbors and therefore is a 
stronger response competitor than Bouteloua. 
Growth was strongly affected by factors other than 
competition, since aboveground neighbor mass ex­
plained no more than 40% of the variation in trans­
plant growth (Figure 5). Environmental heterogeneity 
may contribute to the variation in growth: species 
composition and amount of bare ground varied 
among tubes. Other factors that could affect trans­
plant growth include genotype, initial mass, and her­
bivory (Goldberg 1987). 
Species identity 
Survival and root: shoot ratio were strongly affected 
by transplant species identity (Table 1). Interspecific 
differences reflect genetic variation but may also re­
flect biotic factors such as species-specific herbivory. 
More insect herbivory was observed on Agropyron 
than Bouteloua transplants (1. Bakker, personal obser­
vation), which may have contributed to the lower sur­
vival (Figure 2) and higher root: shoot ratios (Fig­

bors may have protected transplants from herbivores 
(Wilson 1994), explaining the tendency for higher 
survival of Agropyron transplants in the presence of

neighbors in the Agropyron-dominated vegetation 
(Figure 2). 
Over the course of the experiment, Agropyron al­
located slightly more biomass to roots than shoots 
while Bouteloua allocated almost twice as much bio­
mass to shoots as to roots. These differences in bio­
mass allocation likely reflect ontogenetic patterns, as 
C3 species prepare for dry, warm summer conditions 
by building up belowground reserves (Morgan et al. 
1998). 
Water availability 
The absence of significant effects of water availabil­
ity may relate to the timing of pulses in relation to 
plant phenological stage (Bilbrough and Caldwell 
1997). Factors that control one stage in a plant's life 
history may not be critical at another stage. For ex­
ample, seed germination under water stress and seed­
ling survival under water stress are not correlated in 
several C3 and C4 grasses (Qi and Redmann 1993). 
In this experiment, water availability did not affect 
the survival, growth, or biomass allocation patterns of 
older transplants even though soil water availability 
strongly controls the germination and establishment 
of both transplant species (Briske and Wilson 1980; 
Qi and Redmann 1993; Lauenroth et al. 1994). Boute­
loua has a high water use efficiency (Morgan et al. 
1998) and is physiologically affected by small water 
events (Sala and Lauenroth 1982), but the growth of 
individual plants does not appear to be limited by 
water availability. 
Also, processes during the interpulse interval 
(Goldberg and Novoplansky 1997) may have pre­
vented the detection of significant effects of water 
availability. Interpulse processes include transplant 
moisture stress and mortality. 
Although community-level production 
in the 
northern Great Plains is strongly correlated with pre­
cipitation (Sala et al. 1988), water availability was not 
a limiting factor in the growth or biomass allocation 
patterns of Agropyron or Bouteloua. Other resources 
such as nitrogen may have limited transplant growth 
(Casper and Jackson 1997). A study in North Dakota 
found that water availability limited Pascopyrum 
smithii (Rydb .) LOve biomass production and nitro­
gen availability limited Agropyron biomass produc­
tion (Frank and Ries 1990). Interspecific differences 
in resource limitation help explain species coexist­
ence and the paradoxical result that water limits com­
munity-level production but does not limit the growth 
of a particular species. 
Vegetation types 
The presence of Bouteloua in both vegetation types 
(Table 2) suggests that individuals either survived 
cultivation or invaded from adjacent prairie after cul­
tivation ended. In light of the strong competitive ef­
fects of Agropyron (Table 1) and the fact that compe­

124 
tition from existing vegetation greatly reduces the es­
tablishment of Bouteloua (Samuel and Hart 1992; 
Aguilera and Lauenroth 1995), it seems probable that 
Bouteloua establishment occurred before Agropyron 
was sown. Cover of Bouteloua was much lower in ei­
ther vegetation type (4%, Table 2) than in unbroken 
prairie nearby (15%, Christian and Wilson (1999)), 
illustrating its slow recovery after disturbance (Sam­
uel and Hart 1994; Coffin et at. 1996). 
The community-level characteristics reported by 
this study (Table 2) correspond with those of many 
other studies (Hull and Klomp 1967; Smoliak et aI. 
1967; Looman and Heinrichs 1973; Redente et aI. 
1989). For example, aboveground production is 
higher for Agropyron than 
for native 
species 
(Lawrence and Ratzlaff 1989) and below ground pro­
duction is lower (Smoliak et al. 1967) or equal (Re­
dente et at. 1989) than in successional prairie or un­
broken prairie. In addition, soil organic mailer levels 
are reduced in Agropyron-dominated vegetation (Dor­
maar et at. 1995). Together, these results suggest that 
Agropyron exports nutrients from the soil (Dormaar 
et at. 1995; Lesica and DeLuca 1996) and has signif­
icant long-term ecosystem effects (Christian and Wil­
son 1999). Competitive ability is a significant factor 
contributing to the maintenance of existing Agropy­
ron populations and the invasion of new areas by 
Agropyron. Therefore, Agropyron will continue to af­
fect ecosystem structure and function in the northern 
Great Plains for the foreseeable future .
