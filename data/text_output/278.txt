Abstract
Pine–oak forests are of high ecological impor-
tance worldwide, but many are threatened by uncharacter-
istically severe wildﬁre. Forest restoration treatments,
including the reintroduction of a surface ﬁre regime, are
intended to decrease ﬁre hazard and emulate historic eco-
system structure and function. Restoration has recently
received much management attention and short-term study,
but little is known about longer-term ecosystem responses.
We remeasured a replicated experimental restoration site in
the southwestern United States 5 years after treatments.
Basal area, tree density, and canopy cover decreased in the
treated units at a faster rate than in controls. Delayed
mortality, not evident right after treatment, decreased den-
sity modestly (13% in treated units and 10% in controls) but
disproportionately affected large trees (‘‘large’’ ponderosa
pines were those with diameter at breast height [dbh]
‡37.5 cm; other species dbh ‡20 cm). In treated units, 10.9
large trees ha–1 died, whereas 6.2 trees ha–1 died in control
units. Compared with reference conditions, the experi-
mental blocks remained higher in pine density and, in three
of the four blocks, in basal area. Pine trees grew signiﬁ-
cantly faster in treated units than in controls, enough to
reach the reference level of basal area in 6 years. Although
mortality of large trees is a concern, the treated units have
vigorous growth and low density, indicating that they will
be relatively resistant to future drought and ﬁre events.
Similar treatments may be beneﬁcial in many areas of the
United States and in related pine-oak ecosystems elsewhere.

Introduction
Severe wildﬁres pose a major challenge to forest sustain-
ability in mixed forests of Pinus and Quercus spp. in many
areas of the world. The combination of modern land-use
practices, especially ﬁre exclusion, together with warming
climate (Westerling et al. 2006), has led to increasingly
large and severe wildﬁres in pine–oak forests of the United
States (Barton 2002), Mexico (Rodrı´guez-Trejo & Fule´
2003), and the Mediterranean Basin (Leone & Lovreglio
2004). Forest restoration treatments in diverse regions,
such as Spain (Pausas et al. 2004) and Arizona (Covington
et al. 1997), share similar aims, such as decreasing fuel
loads and recreating historical patterns of species compo-
sition and density. Despite substantial investment in res-
toration in the United States, however, relatively little is
known about the effectiveness of forest treatments (Gov-
ernment Accountability Ofﬁce 2005), largely because new
research initiatives have only recently begun to provide
initial measurements of treatment effects (e.g., Stephens &
Moghaddas 2005). Longer-term assessments are crucial for
making sound and efﬁcient decisions about treatment ap-
proaches, especially because changing climate is expected
to impose novel environmental conditions (McKenzie et al.
2004), under which posttreatment forests may respond in
unforeseen ways.
In the southwestern United States, ecologically based
treatments have been tested for simultaneously decreasing
fuel hazards and restoring historic patterns of structure
and function in (PIPO) pine (P. ponderosa) forests
(Covington et al. 1997, Allen et al. 2002, Romme et al.

2003). Methods have varied, but the general idea has been
(1) to conserve rare and important native ecosystem ele-
ments, such as old trees, and thin, dense stands of young
trees that have been established since 1880 to 1900, when
region-wide ﬁre exclusion, livestock grazing, and logging
began (Swetnam & Baisan 1996); (2) to treat accumulated
surface fuels; and (3) to reintroduce surface ﬁre through
prescribed burning or wildland ﬁre use (Fule´ et al. 2006).
Early ﬁndings have generally met expectations in terms of
plant community recovery (Moore et al. 2006), ﬁre hazard
decrease (Fule´ et al. 2001), physiologic response of old
trees (Wallin et al. 2004), and ecosystem function (Kaye
et al. 2005). However, the only studies with longer-than-
immediate posttreatment data are from the 3-ha Gus
Pearson Natural Area (Wallin et al. 2004) and an unre-
plicated research site near Grand Canyon (Fule´ et al.
2002a, 2005).
Evidence that changes were occurring several years
after treatment appeared in one of the ﬁrst and largest
well-monitored restoration studies in the Southwest, at
Mt. Trumbull in the Grand Canyon–Parashant National
Monument, northwestern Arizona. The research design
included a replicated controlled test on four experimental
blocks within a larger landscape-scale (approximately
3,000 ha) pair of treated and control areas. The Mt.
Trumbull restoration project has been a useful example
for ecologists, managers, and policy makers. Tree thin-
ning, forest ﬂoor removal around the base of old trees,
and dormant season–prescribed burning were completed
in the experimental blocks by 2000. Forest density de-
creased by an average of 77%, from approximately 1370
trees ha–1 to approximately 315 trees ha–1, and diameter
distributions were shifted more closely toward preﬁre-
exclusion patterns while retaining structural diversity
(Waltz et al. 2003). Crownﬁre fuel hazards decreased
dramatically (Fule´ et al. 2001). However, severe drought
prevailing in the Southwest since 1996 continued in 2000
and 2002, fostering region-wide tree mortality from lack
of moisture and bark beetle attack (Breshears et al. 2005).
In addition, we found patches of posttreatment mortality
in the Mt. Trumbull landscape associated with heat
damage from prescribed burning broadcast slash (Jerman
et al. 2004). It was clear that a simple comparison before
and after treatment was inadequate to assess the longer-
term treatment effects.
We remeasured the Mt. Trumbull experimental blocks
in 2005 to assess posttreatment forest dynamics in the
presence of severe drought, focusing on the following
questions: (1) How has stand structure changed in the
posttreatment period? (2) What are the survival and mor-
tality patterns of large and old trees? (3) How might tree
growth and new regeneration affect future forest develop-
ment?
Methods
Study Area
The study area was a ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa var.
scopulorum P. & C. Lawson) and Gambel oak (Q. gam-
bellii Nutt.) (QUGA) forest in the Uinkaret Mountains,
northwestern
Arizona
(3622’N,
1137’W).
Elevation
ranges from 2000 to 2250 m. Two remote automated-
weather stations (RAWS) are in the area: precipitation
averaged 430 mm annually between 1992 and 2005 (Nixon
Flats RAWS) and 326 mm annually between 1985 and
2005 (Mt. Logan RAWS). Drought affected the study area
throughout most of the experimental period. Total precip-
itation at Nixon Flats and Mt. Logan was below average in
six of nine years between 1997 and 2005, including a se-
vere drought in 2002 (150 and 125 mm at the Nixon and
Logan RAWS, respectively), when precipitation levels
were the third lowest in 100 years in Arizona (NOAA
2006a). The Palmer Drought Severity Index also indicated
the occurrence of extended drought between 1994 and
2004 in northwestern Arizona (NOAA 2006b). Soils are
derived from basaltic parent material. The two main soil
types found in the study area are the Wutoma-Lozinta
complex, which consists of ashy-skeletal over fragmental
or cindery, mixed, mesic Vitrandic Haplustepts, and
Sponiker soils, classiﬁed as ﬁne, smectitic, mesic Pachic
Argiustolls
(Natural
Resources
Conservation
Service
2004).
Field
Four experimental blocks were established, representing
the heterogeneity of the landscape in terms of vegetation,
topography, and past management history (Fig. 1). Each
block was divided into two units and randomly assigned to
control or restoration treatment. The blocks ranged in size
from approximately 16 to 40 ha, although we measured
equal-area portions within each block as described later.
Block 1 (EB1) was dominated by ponderosa pine on
shallow lava soils. Block 2 (EB2) included abundant
Gambel oak on basalt-derived clay soils. Block 3 (EB3)
was pine–oak forest at the highest elevation on cinder soils.
Block 4 (EB4) consisted of dense, young ponderosa trees
and some pinyon (P. edulis Engelm.) (PIED) and juniper
(Juniperus osteosperma [Torr.] Little) (JUOS) on basalt-
derived clay soils. New Mexico locust (Robinia neomexi-
cana Gray) (RONE) was scattered across most of the units.
Pretreatment basal area stocking ranged from 23.7 to 50.3
m2 ha–1, much higher than the reconstructed levels in 1870
of 4.6 to 9.2 m2 ha–1 (Waltz et al. 2003).
Twenty permanent monitoring plots were established in
each control and treatment area, for a total of 40 400-m2
624

plots/experimental block, on a 60 m grid representing a
measured area of 7.2 ha in each experimental unit. EB1
was established in 1997 and the others in 1998. Overstory
trees taller than breast height (1.37 m) were tagged and
measured on a 400-m2 circular ﬁxed-area plot. Measure-
ments included species, diameter at breast height (dbh),
and condition class (Thomas et al. 1979). Trees below
breast height and shrubs were tallied by condition and
height classes on a nested 100-m2 subplot. Dead woody
biomass and forest ﬂoor depth were measured on a 15.2-m
planar transect in a random direction from each plot center,
according to the method of Brown (1974).
The forest restoration prescription was designed to
rapidly emulate the historic forest structure, predating
European settlement and ﬁre exclusion that began in 1870
(Moore et al. 1999), followed by reintroduction of surface
ﬁre. Living trees predating 1870 were retained. Wherever

conifer
material
was
encountered (i.e., snags, logs, stumps, stump holes), 1.5 to
3 younger trees of the same species within a 9.1 to 18.2 m
radius were selected as replacements (Covington et al.
1997, Waltz et al. 2003). Fire-susceptible deciduous spe-
cies, e.g., oak and locust, were not thinned. Thinning was
carried out by commercial contractors and Bureau of Land
Management (BLM) crews in 1999. EB4 was so dense that
not all the trees marked for retention could be safely
thinned and burned. Slash was lopped and scattered. Deep
duff layers were raked 30 to 90 cm away from boles of all
pre-1870 trees and snags. Treatment units were burned in
the winter of 1999 to 2000. Six plots in the control area of
EB1 (plot nos. 14 through 19) and one in the control of
EB2 (plot no. 21) were inadvertently burned during the
prescribed ﬁre; they were excluded from analysis of sur-
face fuel loading by Waltz et al. (2003) and in the present
study. In April 2000, a severe wildﬁre burned the control
unit of EB3. The intense wildﬁre eliminated the unit as a
valid untreated control for the block. In July 2000, we
established a new paired control. No pretreatment data
(1997 and 1998) were available for the control 2000, but
tree structure was similar to the original EB3 control (basal
area 30.5 and 27.2 m2 ha–1 and density 951 and 738 trees
ha–1, respectively).
All plots were remeasured in May to July 2000, and 5
years later during May to June 2005. Measurements of
tree height and crown base height were added, and
crown scorch and bole char were measured in 2000.
Through repeated measurements of the same plots, we
occasionally found and corrected errors, most notably
when trees that had been listed as dead were found to be
alive.

Analysis
The study was designed as a replicated experiment (n = 4).
We used an alpha level of 0.10 to denote signiﬁcant differ-
ences because of the small sample size; the same alpha level
was used by Waltz et al. (2003) in the ﬁrst report on this
study. By using the replicated experimental units, we avoi-
ded the psuedoreplicated analysis applied at other sites that
had only single examples of each treatment (Fule´ et al.
2002a, 2006). The trade-off, however, was to accept low
statistical power. The response variables of canopy cover,
basal area, and tree density were compared with blocked
repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) at three
time periods: plot establishment (1997 and 1998), following
treatment (2000), and 5 years after treatment (2005). We
included all three dates to evaluate posttreatment changes in
the context of the changes associated with treatment. We
tested that the data met ANOVA assumptions of normality
(Shapiro-Wilks test) and homoscedasticity (Levene’s test of
equal variances). If not, variables were transformed (square-
root or natural logarithm) where necessary and tested again
to meet ANOVA assumptions. After a signiﬁcant multivar-
iate test statistic (Wilk’s lambda) was determined for change
over time, univariate ANOVA comparisons within years
were examined. We also made pairwise comparisons (Stu-
dent t test) between the three time periods of within-subjects
factors, with Bonferroni-corrected p values. Tree-growth
data were compared with paired Student t tests. Unless
otherwise speciﬁed, p values in the results refer to univariate
ANOVA test statistics. Although the statistical testing ap-
proach served to summarize the four replicated blocks, we
present the results by each individual block to illustrate
similarities and differences.
Fates of individual large trees (ponderosa pine ‡37.5 cm
dbh; other species ‡20 cm dbh) were followed up to track
survival. Because the original EB3 control unit was relo-
cated, only trees from the other three control units and four
treatment units were tracked. We tested differences in age,
percent canopy scorch, and bole char of surviving versus
dying trees in the treated units with Kruskal-Wallis one-
way ANOVA.
Results
Changes in Stand Structure
Basal area, tree density, and canopy cover in the treated units
decreased not only in the immediate treatment period but also
in the subsequent 5 years. Combining all four EB units, total
basal area (Table 1 and Fig. 2) was indistinguishable in 1997
and1998 (p = .98)butwas signiﬁcantlydecreasedbecause of
treatment, decreasing 47% from an average of 35.4 m2 ha–1
before treatment to 18.8 m2 ha–1 afterward, whereas controls
decreased only 3% (35.3 to 34.3 m2 ha–1) (p = .01) (Table 1
and Fig. 2). Control basal area decreased only 1% from 2000
to 2005, but basal area in treatment units went down by 22%
to 14.7 m2 ha–1, although this change with time was not sta-
tistically signiﬁcant (paired Student t test, p = .58). Total tree
density did not differ between treatments in 1997 and 1998
(p = .95), averaging 1,372 trees ha–1 (controls) and 1,375
trees ha–1 (treatments). Density decreased by 7% in 2000 in
controls to 1,269 trees ha–1, but cutting decreased tree density
by 75% in treatments to 346 trees ha–1 (p = .01). Further
decreases by 2005 of 10% in controls and 13% in treatments
were not statistically signiﬁcant (paired Student t test,
p = .13). Density in 2005 in control units averaged 1,140
trees ha–1 (83% of the pretreatment level) and treatment units
averaged 302 trees ha–1 (22% of the pretreatment level).
Canopy cover (Fig. 3) did not differ between treatments in
1997 and 1998 (p = .41), but cover was signiﬁcantly de-
creased with treatment by 2000 (p < .001), decreasing an
average of 35%, whereas cover increased 5% in controls. All
units decreased between 2000 and 2005, decreasing 13% in
controls and 22% in treatments, but the posttreatment dif-
ferences were not signiﬁcant (paired Student t test, p = .23).
Average size (quadratic mean diameter) of ponderosa
pine trees increased substantially in the treatment units,
reﬂecting the cutting of small trees. Before treatment, pines
averaged 23.1 cm in control units and 24.9 cm in treatment
units, a slight (<2 cm) but statistically signiﬁcant difference
(p = .07). Tree sizes in the control units changed little
(22.2 cm in 2000, 22.9 cm in 2005) but increased signiﬁ-
cantly in treatment units (40.6 cm in 2000, an increase of
62% compared with the pretreatment condition, because
thinning was from below, and 39.3 cm in 2005) (p = .03).
Oak sizes before treatment averaged 8.9 cm in control units
and 11.4 cm in treatment units, changing to 10.7 cm and
12.9 cm, respectively, by 2005. The changes for oaks were
not statistically signiﬁcant.
Survival and Mortality of Large Trees
Tree mortality caused by cutting and other factors in the
treatment phase (between 1997 and 1998 and 2000) aver-
aged 1,029 trees ha–1. Approximately 55% of trees, mostly
ponderosa pines, were identiﬁed as being cut. Another
13%, mostly small-diameter trees, were not encountered
alive, but the basal part of the trees could not be relocated,
so the cause of death is uncertain. Finally, 31% of the dead
trees, mostly oak and locust, were not cut but had died by
2000. Therefore, noncutting mortality in the treatment units
may have ranged from approximately 330 to 460 trees ha–1.
Ingrowth of young trees in the same period averaged 3
trees ha–1. For comparison, mortality in the control units
averaged 82 trees ha–1 in the same time period, and in-

growth averaged 8 trees ha–1 (ingrowth estimates exclude
the EB3 control because it was relocated). Posttreatment
total mortality between 2000 and 2005 averaged 98 trees
ha–1 in the treated units, offset by ingrowth in the same
period of 54 trees ha–1 (93% of which were oak and locust).
Posttreatment total mortality in the control units averaged
142 trees ha–1 versus ingrowth of 13 trees ha–1. Although
the total values of delayed mortality were similar across
treatments, a pattern of delayed mortality of old and/or
large ponderosa pine trees appeared in the posttreatment
period, with greater impact in treated units.
During the treatment phase (1997 and 1998 to 2000), an
average of 7.8 large trees ha–1 died (‘‘large’’ = ponderosa
pine ‡37.5 cm [14.8 in] dbh; other species ‡ 20 cm [8 in]
dbh). Oaks comprised most of the dead trees, with ponderosa
pines representing fewer than 1 tree ha–1. Fewer than 1 tree
ha–1 of any species died in the control units. In the post-
treatment period, from 2000 to 2005, an additional 10.9 trees
ha–1 died in the treated units, of which 10 trees ha–1 were
ponderosa pines. Large-tree mortality ranged from <4 trees
ha–1 (EB4) to 20 trees ha–1 (EB3). The largest decrease, in
EB3, was primarily caused by the death of large ponderosa
pines (19 trees ha–1); these trees represented 8.1 m2 ha–1 of
basal area, making up 97% of the 2000 to 2005 decrease in
basal area in this unit. During the posttreatment period in the
control, an additional 6.2 trees ha–1 died in the treated units,
of which 4.6 trees ha–1 were ponderosa.
Large ponderosa pines were also removed by cutting,
averaging 22.8 trees ha–1. Based on increment cores col-
lected from all ponderosa ‡37.5 cm in pretreatment sam-
pling, 3% of the cut pines had center dates before 1870,
although the trees were relatively young (1851 and 1860),
and 2% could not be dated but were small in diameter (<40
cm). Therefore, cutting was 96% to 98% accurate in terms
of the age-based thinning prescription. Retained large pines
that could be dated were 45% older than 1870 (range 1464
to 1865), and 55% were younger (1874 to 1932).
Trees that died in the posttreatment period in the control
units had a signiﬁcantly older average center date (1738;
n = 8) than survivors, which had an average center date of
1883 (n = 108) (Mann-Whitney U test, p < .001). Dying
trees in the treated units also tended to be older, but the age
difference was much smaller and not signiﬁcant (survivors
average center date 1857 [n = 58]; died average center date
1849 [n = 21]) (Mann-Whitney U test, p = .42). Mean
crown scorch measured in 2000 was identical (30%) for
large pines that survived and those that died by 2005
(Mann-Whitney U test, p = .93), and maximum bole char
height was higher for surviving (2.1 m) than for dead trees
(1.5 m), although the difference was not signiﬁcant (Mann-
Whitney U test, p = .15). The combined effect of mortality
and cutting was a decrease in the density of large pon-
derosa pines from an average of 57.2 trees ha–1 in 1997 and
1998 to 23.5 trees ha–1 in 2005. Large pine densities in the
controls decreased from 63.8 trees ha–1 in 1997 and 1998 to
59.2 trees ha–1 in 2005.
Tree Growth and Regeneration
Average annual diameter growth and basal area increment
of ponderosa pine trees (Table 2) were signiﬁcantly higher
in treated units (average 0.17 and 8.57 cm2 y–1) than
control units (0.10 and 3.23 cm2 y–1) (paired Student t test,
p = .03 and p = .02, respectively). Gambel oak diameter
and basal area growth did not differ by treatment (paired
Student t test, p = .43 and p = .57, respectively).
Total tree regeneration was similar in control versus
treatment units before treatment (2807 and 2833 trees ha–1,
respectively). Regeneration decreased in the controls units
by 15% in 2000 and a further 27% from 2000 to 2005
compared with an increase of 68% in treatment units
(Table 3), resulting by 2005 in regeneration density
approximately 228% higher in treatment units (3,584 trees
ha–1) than in control units (1,574 trees ha–1). However, the
differences were not statistically signiﬁcant because high
variability (Wilk’s lambda, p = .18). The sprouting species
Gambel oak and New Mexican locust made up the majority
of regeneration in all periods.
Ponderosa pine seedlings decreased with treatment
compared with the pattern of proliﬁc oak and locust
sprouting. In 1997 and 1998, ponderosa seedlings had an
identical average of 82.5 trees ha–1 in control versus
treatment units. By 2000, pine seedlings decreased by 42%
in the control units averaging 47.5 trees ha–1 in controls,
but only 8.8 trees ha–1 in the treatment units. These patterns
remained relatively consistent in 2005, with an average of
51.3 trees ha–1 in controls versus 5.0 trees ha–1 in treatment
units. The changes were not statistically signiﬁcant because
of high variability (Wilk’s lambda, p = .21) despite the
striking decrease in pine seedling density in the treatment
units.
Duff depth (Table 4) did not differ between control and
treatment units in 1997 and 1998 (3.7 and 3.0 cm,
respectively, p = .32), but ﬁre signiﬁcantly decreased duff
depth in treated units by 2000 (3.2 vs 1.4 cm, p = .02).
Duff depth in treated units averaged 1.4 cm in 2000,
decreasing by 30% to 0.9 cm by 2005, compared with 3.2
cm in 2000 in control units, decreasing 9% by 2005 (Ta-
ble 4). Litter and woody debris were highly variable, and
changes were not statistically signiﬁcant (Wilk’s lambda,
p = .57 for litter depth and p = .13 for total woody debris).
Discussion
Five years after completion of the initial phase of forest-
restoration treatments, forest structure was substantially
628
Environ Manage (2007) 40:623–634
123

altered by posttreatment tree mortality, although many of
the changes were not statistically signiﬁcant. With respect
to treatment objectives, drought-related and posttreatment-
related mortality was not problematic because a surplus of
ponderosa pine stocking still remains. Compared with
preﬁre-exclusion reference conditions (1870), basal areas
in the treatment units were still >100% or higher in 2005
(Fig. 2), indicating that the thinning prescription left an
adequate margin of replacement trees. The exception was
EB3, where the death of large trees caused basal area in
2005 to decrease slightly below the 1870 level (Fig. 2).
Although tree mortality in general does not necessarily
constitute a problem, mortality of larger and older pon-
derosa pine trees is of concern because these trees form
important habitat elements, conserve genetic diversity over
centuries, contribute to aesthetic qualities of the forest, and
simply take a long time to replace. Assuming that the
control units represent the ‘‘background’’ rate of mortality
during the drought, large pines were approximately twice
as likely to die in the treated units, approximately 5 versus
12 trees ha–1. Relative to the large pine density in 2000,
posttreatment mortality corresponded to only 7% in the
control but 34% in the treated units. These values were
much higher than large-tree mortality in an unreplicated
restoration study near Grand Canyon during a nearly
overlapping posttreatment period (1999 to 2004), where
pine mortality was 3% in the control unit and 9% in the
treatment unit (Fule´ et al. 2005). Unlike patterns observed

elsewhere (McHugh & Kolb 2003, Fule´ et al. 2005), sur-
viving and dying trees on the experimental blocks at Mt.
Trumbull did not differ in age, canopy scorch, or bole char.
There is evidence that the thin lava soils at EB1 contributed
to high ﬁre-caused mortality (Fule´ et al. 2002b), perhaps
through heating roots close to the surface (Swezy & Agee
1991). Accumulated surface fuels had been raked away
from the boles of large trees before the burn (Covington
et al. 1997), but Graham and Jain (2005) found substantial
ﬁne roots in this type of forest ﬂoor material.
Future development of forest structure will depend on
the balance between continued mortality, surviving tree
growth, and new regeneration (Fig. 4). Lingering effects of
treatment-related damage may cause additional mortality,
but most studies of ﬁre-caused mortality indicate that the
great majority of deaths are evident within 3 years after ﬁre
(McHugh & Kolb 2003, Fowler & Sieg 2004), so we ex-
pect that future mortality in the treated units would not
differ from that in the control units. In fact, mortality may
be decreased because evidence from physiologic studies in
the Pearson Natural Area restoration site indicates that for
at least 7 years after treatment, old trees had higher pre-
dawn water potential, stomatal conductance, leaf nitrogen
concentration, resin ﬂow, and tougher foliage than paired
trees in the control area (Feeney et al. 1998, Stone et al.
1999, Wallin et al. 2004). If the surviving old trees at Mt.
Trumbull respond similarly, they may be more likely to
persist than those in the control units.

Ponderosa pine diameter growth was 70% and basal area
growth 165% greater in the treated units than in the control
units. If the surviving trees in EB3, 69 pines ha–1 and 19
oaks ha–1, continued to grow at the average rates, the unit
would regain the historic reference basal area within 6
years. In the other units, enhanced growth will maintain
uncharacteristically high tree basal area at the expense of
understory vegetation.
Regeneration was highly skewed toward sprouting spe-
cies, which commonly respond vigorously to disturbance
and may come to dominate the forest (Gottfried 1980),
although they are susceptible to ﬁre and can be controlled
with repeated burning (Harrington 1985). However, pon-
derosa pine regeneration densities in 2005 were the lowest
reported in northern Arizona restoration treatments, aver-
aging 5 trees ha–1 compared with 7 to 41 trees ha–1 reported
by Bailey and Covington (2002) at several sites in the
Flagstaff area, approximately 200 km southeast of Mt.
Trumbull, and 10 trees ha–1 at Grandview, approximately
100 km southeast (Fule´ et al. 2005). Mast et al. (1999)
calculated that the historically sparse forest structure of
long-lived pine trees near Flagstaff could be maintained at
a rate of only 3.6 seedlings ha–1 decade–1 and could survive
to become established trees. Historic regeneration was also
characterized by pulses of annual to multidecadal width,
rather than constant inputs (Savage et al. 1996, Mast et al.
1999). Because ponderosa seed trees remain well distrib-
uted across the Mt. Trumbull experimental sites, and duff
depth was signiﬁcantly decreased by treatment, thus
facilitating pine seedling establishment, it is likely that
ponderosa regeneration will be successful in the coming
years. Regeneration should be closely monitored, however.
The fact that the Mt. Trumbull experimental blocks were
nested within a larger monitored treated-control landscape
makes it possible to compare ﬁndings across multiple
scales. In a landscape-scale study assessing restoration
treatment effectiveness on 1,200 ha at Mt. Trumbull,
Roccaforte (2005) found much lower mortality of old trees.
Only 13% of the pre-1870 pines in the treated area died,
compared with 9% in the control, indicating that pre-1870

pines in untreated areas were nearly equally vulnerable as
those receiving restoration treatments. Treatments were
completed in the landscape-scale study between 1996 and
2002, and data were collected in 2003. The landscape-scale
study included 117 permanent plots covering approxi-
mately 1,200 ha, split between treated and control areas.
Leaving aside the possibility that additional mortality of
large pines occurred between 2003 and 2005, the lower
mortality of large trees across the larger landscape suggests
that the experimental blocks were not representative of the
broader area, at least in terms of tree survival. One of the
four blocks, EB1, was located on shallow lava soils where
we found that low-intensity burning, even in the absence of
any activity fuels, led to high mortality (Fule´ et al. 2002b).
This soil type represented only a small portion of the
landscape measured by Roccaforte (2005).
Management Implications
The ﬁndings of posttreatment mortality and limited pine
regeneration may be applied to suggest changes in treat-
ment methods. For valued and vulnerable ecosystem
components, such as old trees, it would be useful to adopt
any practices that might decrease the stress of treatment
activities. Although this study found no correlation be-
tween delayed mortality and heat effects (canopy scorch,
bole char), prescribed burning broadcast slash has been
experimentally linked with tree death in other Mt. Trum-
bull study sites (Jerman et al. 2004). This source of damage
can be controlled by slash compression before burning
(Jerman et al. 2004) or by removing or piling slash.
A possible approach to the death of big trees would be to
retain additional large trees during thinning, either through
increasing the ratio of replacement trees or through a
diameter cap on cutting. However, there are trade-offs to
consider because the spatial pattern of restoration thinning
was designed to emulate the clumpy pattern of preﬁre-
exclusion forests (White 1985, Abella et al. 2006). Moore
et al. (1999) presented a stem-mapped example from the
Mt. Trumbull area to illustrate how the selection of young
replacement trees within a speciﬁed radius of remnant pre-
1870 material resulted in the retention of trees close to
where tree patches had been before as well as the reopening
of historic forest gaps. Understory plant productivity in
such gaps can reach orders of magnitude higher than pro-
ductivity under trees (Moore et al. 2006). Because the
biggest trees within the search radius were already the ones
selected for retention, a rule specifying retention of more
large trees would inevitably result in crowding or elimi-
nating many gaps. The thinning guidelines have already
successfully discriminated between pre-1870 and younger
trees, conserved the former category, and retained trees
displayed high growth rates. The average size of pine trees
in the treated units was already ‘‘large,’’ e.g., approxi-
mately 40 cm. Finally, in some respects the restoration
thinning prescription applied here has similarities to un-
even-aged management (see quantitative comparison in
Edminster and Olson 1996). The main differences lie in the
complete retention of all large and old trees and the sub-
stitution of individual young replacement trees for the
lower portion of the uneven-aged diameter curve. As a
result, the restoration diameter distribution is skewed more

toward large trees than the reverse-J distribution used in
uneven-aged management.
The only planned future treatment for the experimental
units is repeated prescribed burning. Concern about the
possibility of additional damage to old trees must be
weighed against the role of surface ﬁre in thinning the ﬁre-
susceptible oak and locust sprouts. Although in an ideal-
ized situation it might be attractive to view ﬁre as the
natural agent for maintaining open forest structure with
minimal human guidance, the Mt. Trumbull forest is still
quite removed from reference conditions, and prescribed
burns differ in many ways from the free-burning wildﬁres
of the past. Therefore, it may make sense for managers to
use ﬁre gently by minimizing it near vulnerable old trees,
perhaps focusing on thinning sprouting trees with spot or
ring ignition patterns.
Continued monitoring will be essential for evaluating
the progress of the restoration activity. In most respects, the
results have been positive in terms of forest structure, ex-
cept for the undesired mortality of a relatively high pro-
portion of large pine trees and the low level of pine
regeneration. Both factors should be closely tracked. The
severe drought period from 1996 to 2002 may be an
anomaly or a precursor of climate change (McKenzie et al.
2004, Breshears et al. 2005). Even under these difﬁcult
circumstances, however, overall forest structural impacts
were relatively controlled, suggesting that restoration
treatments may help pine–oak forests persist through cli-
matic shifts. Warming climate is already a driver of
increasingly severe ﬁres in pine–oak ecoystems worldwide
(Pausas et al. 2004, Westerling et al. 2006), and additional
warming
is
anticipated
to
exacerbate
ﬁre
activity
(McKenzie et al. 2004). Restoration treatments, such as
those studied here, may be useful in helping to sustain
native forest species through periods of climate and ﬁre
disturbance regime change.
