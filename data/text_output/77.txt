154 ASSESSING FOREST ECOSYSTEM HEALTH IN THE INLAND WEST 
ABSTRACT. Heavy livestock grazing, logging, and fire exclusion 
associated with Euro-American settlement has brought about sub­
stantial changes. in forest conditions in western forests. Thus, old­
growth definitions based on current forest conditions may not be 
compatible with the natural conditions prevalent throughout the evo­
lutionary history of western forest types. Detailed analysis of data 
from two study areas in the southwestern ponderosa pine type sug­
gests that average tree densities have increased from as few as 23 
trees per acre in presettlement times to as many as 851 trees per acre 
today. Associated with these increases in tree density are increases in 
canopy closure, vertical fuel continuity, and surface fuel loadings 
resulting in fire hazards over large areas never reached before settle­
ment In addition, fire exclusion and increased tree density has likely 
decreased tree vigor (increasing mortalityfrom disease, insect, drought, 
etc.), herbaceous and shrub production, aesthetic values, water avail­
ability and runoff, and nutrient availability, and also changed soil 
characteristics and altered wildlife habitat. To remedy these prob­
lems and restore these forest ecosystems to more nearly natural 
conditions, and maintain a viable cohort of old age-class trees, it win 
be necessary to thin out most of the postsettlement trees, manually 
remove heavy fuels from the base of large, old trees, and reintroduce 
periodic burning. 
Between the two extremes ofpassively following nature on the one 
hand, and open revolt against her on the other, is a wide area for 
applying the basic philosophy of working in harmony with natural 
tendencies. (H. J. Lutz 1959) 
INTRODUCTION 
Understanding natural ecological conditions and processes, before sig­
nificant impact by Euro-American settlement (Kilgore 1985), is central to 
developing ecologically coherent forest management programs (e.g., Vogl 
1974; Franklin 1978; Harris 1984; Kilgore 1985; Forman and Godron 
1986). This is particularly true for management of landscape diversity 
with remnant natural patches of old-growth forests (Bonnicksen and Stone 
1985; Parsons et al. 1986; Moir and Dieterich 1988; Forman and Godron 
1986; Booth 1991) or managing for the development of old-growth and 
other stages of forest development (Thomas 1979; Hoover and Wills 1984; 
Moir and Dieterich 1988). However, heavy livestock grazing, logging, and 
fire suppression associated with Euro-American settlement have brought 
w. W.Covington and M. M. Moore 
about substantial changes in forest conditions in western forests, so much 
so that current conditions may be decidedly "unnatural." In particular, the 
exclusion of natural fires has led to increased tree densities and associated 
shifts in ecosystem structure, fire hazard, disturbance regimes, and wild­
life habitat in some western forest types. Thus, old-growth defmitions 
based on current forest structure may not be compatible with the natural 
conditions prevalent throughout the evolutionary history of the organisms 
living in western forests. For these reasons, we believe that planning and 
management for old-growth within ponderosa pine and other forest types 
must include an understanding of past (presettlement), present, and future 
conditions. Failing to do so may lead to less than desirable forest condi­
tions in the future. 
In this paper we present a general discussion of changes in natural fire 
regimes, then examine in more detail the evidence for such changes in the 
southwestern ponderosa pine type and how these changes have affected 
overall ecological conditions. Finally, we close with a brief discussion of 
possible methods for remedying some of the problems associated with 
postsettlement changes in western forests. 
NATURAL FIRE REGIMES 
Understanding the natural disturbance regimes under which a particular 
species evolved is central to predicting the ecological consequences of 
management activities (e.g., Bormann 1981; White 1979). Periodic wild­
land fire has played a central role in the evolution of forest and woodland 
ecosystems throughout the western United Stales (Parsons 1981; Kilgore 
1981; Covington et at. I994b). In fact, many species and forest types 
worldwide appear to be dependent upon a particular frequency and inten­
sity of fire for their survival (Mooney 1981; Parsons 1981). 
Fire regimes have been classified according to frequency, intensity, 
size, and type (Heinselman 1981; Kilgore 1981; Sando 1978). Frequency, 
or burning interval, has been defined as the average return period for fire 
burning through a particular vegetation type. Sando defmed frequent fires 
as fires which occur at intervals of 1-10 years; infrequent fires by his 
defmition are fires occurring at intervals greater than 10 years, often as 
infrequently as once every 20-300 years. Kilgore (1981) separated fre­
quent from infrequent fires at 25 years. 
Although fire intensity has been used as a qualitative term (e.g., light 
surface fire vs. severe crown fire), some authors argued for a quantitative 
defmition such as fire line intensity (Sando 1978; Kilgore 1981). Specifi­

157 
156 ASSESSINGFORESTECOSYSTEMHEALTHIN THE INLANDWEST 
cally, they recommended Byram's fife line intensity, a product of heat 
yield per unit area (BTU per square foot) and the rate of fife spread (feet 
per second). The resulting units are BTUs per foot per second. To avoid 
confusing qualitative and quantitative definitions, we recommend that 
qualitative differences be referred to as fife severity, and that the term fife 
intensity be reserved for a more quantitative measure. 
Fire regimes have also been characterized according to size (Table I). 
However, no generally agreed upon classification exists; certainly other 
size classes may bemore appropriate for specific applications. 
Fire type has been classified into as few as two (surface vs. crown) to 
six or more categories. For example, Heinselman (1981) differentiated fife 
type into light surface fifes, severe surface fifes, crown fires, and combina­
tions of the three. Kilgore (1981) used the terms low intensity surface fife, 
high intensity surface fire, stand replacement fire, and combinations of 
these three categories. Several authors have related fire severity to fife 
intensity (Byram 1959; Van Wagner 1973; Albini 1976; Sando 1978). 
Integrating these views on intensity: severity relationships, Sando (1978) 
concluded that at low to moderate (0-1200 BTU/ft/sec) fife line intensity, 
complete mortality of overstory vegetation would not occur. At levels above 
1200 BTU/ft/sec, nearly complete overs tory mortality would be expected 
For this discussion we will use Sando's (1978) classification of natural 
fire regimes. However, more comprehensive classification strategies 
should be developed for designing adaptive management experiments.

Nonetheless, for brevity's sake we will use the following four types in this 
paper: 
Type one: frequent fires (1-25 yr) of low to moderate intensity ( < 
1200 BTU/ft/sec) (e.g., ponderosa pine, lower elevation 
[warmer and drier sites] mixed conifer, giant sequoia, 
southern pine forests, short grass and mixed grass prairies, 
savannahs). 
Type two: infrequent fifes ( > 25 yr) of high intensity (> 1200 BTU/ft/ 
sec)(e.g., boreal and subalpine spruce-fir, higher elevation 
[cooler and wetter] mixed conifer forests, temperate rain 
forests). 
Type three: frequent fires of high intensity (e.g., tall grass prairie). 
Type four: infrequent fires of low to moderate intensity (e.g., deserts, 
tundra, mesic deciduous forests). 
Fire exclusion affects each of these fire regimes differently. Although it 
typically causes major shifts in ecosystem structure and function (see be­
low), from a fife control perspective the central concern is when shifts occur 
between fire regimes. Only small remnants of type three exist. virtually all 
of it having been converted to agriculture. However, under natural condi­
tions, fire suppression would not have been practical in this type because of 
its extreme fife behavior. Fire exclusion in type four has little effect on the 
fire regime because excess flammable organic matter rarely accumulates. 
Over time, fife exclusion in type two will result in rescaling of fife size 
as more patches reach a condition which will support crown fife. For 
example, if we assume that 100 years are necessary for a particular vegeta­
tion type to accumulate sufficient fuel to support a crown fife, then after 
100 years of successful fife exclusion, all of the area in that type would be 
capable of supporting crown fire (Figure I). Thus, in type two, fifes become 
larger over time. 
The greatest change in fire regimes following fife exclusion is in type 
one. Here the natural fire regime was frequent enough to keep surface fuel 
loads low and to thin out trees so that canopy fuels were separated both 
vertically and horizontally. With fife exclusion in this type, surface fuels 
accumulate and trees become established gradually, providing a fuel lad­
der and increasing canopy closure. These changes in fuel structure lead to 
a shift from light surface fifes to intense stand replacement crown fifes 
characteristic of the type two fire regime. Continued fire suppression in 
this type might well lead to the same changes seen in type two fife re­
gimes, l.e., the coalescing of patches'into larger and larger areas capable of 
supporting crown fife (Figure I). The classic example of a type one natural

Weaver 1974). 
Now we will tum to a more detailed discussion of ecological conse­
quences of shifts in fire regimes by examining postsettlement changes in 
southwestern ponderosa pine ecosystems. 
POSTSETTLEMENT CHANGES  
IN SOUTHWESTERN PONDEROSA PINE FORESTS  
It is widely acknowledged that fire exclusion and other factors 
associated with European settlement have greatly altered forest conditions 
in southwestern ponderosa pine (Cooper 1960; Weaver 1951; Covington 
and Sackett 1984; White 1985; Covington and Sackett 1986; Covington 
and Moore 1994a). However, postsettlement changes in the ponderosa 
pine type are not unique to the Southwest. In fact, studies in Utah (Madany 
and West 1983; Stein 1987), Montana (GrueIl et al. 1982), Idaho (Barrett 
1988; Steele et al. 1986), Washington (Weaver 1959), and California (Lau­
denslayer et aI. 1989) suggested that increased tree density, fuel loading, 
and crown fire occurrence are common consequences of fire exclusion 
throughout the ponderosa pine type (Kilgore 1981). Simulation studies 
(van Wagtendonk 1985; Keane et al. 1990) indicated that this phenomenon 
occurs not only in the pure ponderosa pine type, but also in ponderosa 
pine/Douglas-fir and mixed conifer forests as well. Thus, although many 
questions remain regarding the ecological and multiresource implications 
of postsettlement changes in ponderosa pine forests, there is a wide con­
sensus that today's forests are radically different from those present before 
European settlement. 
Reports from early travelers illustrate the changes in appearance of the 
ponderosa pine forest since settlement. E. F. Beale's 1858 report is quoted 
by C. F. Cooper (1960) as follows: 
We carne to a glorious forest of lofty pines, through which we have 
travelled ten miles. The country was beautifully undulating, and 
although we usually associate tpe idea of barrenness with the pine 
regions, it was not so in this instance; every foot being covered with 
the finest grass, and beautiful broad grassy vales extending in every 
direction. The forest was perfectly open and unencumbered with 
brush wood, so that the travelling was excellent. (Beale 1858) 
Cooper (1960) stated "The overwhelming impression one gets from the 
older Indians and white pioneers of the Arizona pine forest is that the 
entire forest was once much more open and park-like than it is today." 

161 
160 ASSESSINGFOREST ECOSYSTEM HEALTHIN THE INLAND WEST 
Before European settlement of northern Arizona in the 1860s and 70s, 
periodic natural surface fires occurred in ponderosa pine forests at fre­
quent intervals, perhaps every 2-12 years (Weaver 1951; Cooper 1960; 
Dieterich 1980). Extensive study of fire scars suggests that the natural fire 
size was approximately 3,000 acres (Swetnam and Dieterich 1985; Swet­
nam 1990). 
Several factors associated with European settlement caused a reduction 
in natural fire frequency and size. Roads and trails broke up fuel continu­
.ity. Domestic livestock grazing, especially overgrazing and trampling by 
cattle and sheep in the 1880s and 18908, greatly reduced herbaceous fuels. 
Active fire suppression, as early as 1908 in the Flagstaff area, was a 
principal duty of early foresters in the Southwest. A direct result of inter­
rupting and suppressing these naturally occurring, periodic fires has been 
the development of overstocked forests. 
Changes in the forest structure (e.g., tree density, cover, and age dis­
tributions) in southwestern ponderosa pine forests since European settle­
ment have been blamed for many forest management problems (Biswell 
1972; Cooper 1960; Weaver 1974; Covington and Sackett 1990; Coving­
ton and Moore 1994a). Forest management problems attributed to fire 
exclusion and resulting increased tree density in southwestern ponderosa 
pine include: 
1. overstocked sapling patches; 
2. reduced tree growth; 
3. stagnated nutrient cycles; 
4. increased disease, insect infestation, and parasites (e.g., root rot, 
bark beetle, dwarf mistletoe); 
5. decreased forage quality and quantity; 
6. increased fuel loading; 
7. increased vertical fuel continuity due to dense sapling patches; 
8. increased severity and destructive potential of wildfires; 
9. increased tree canopy closure; 
10. decreased on-site water availability; 
II. decreased stream-flow and ground water recharge; 
12. shifts in habitat quality for biota; and 
13. decreased diversity of native flora and associated food webs. 
Evidencefor the shift from a type one to a typetwo fire regime in pondero­
sa pine since settlement comes from a study by Barrows (1978), later 
updated by Swetnam (1990) . Using USDA Forest Service wildfire statis­
tics they determined that lightning-caused crown fires had increased from 
10,127 acres per year in the I940s to 15,117 acres per year in the 1980s. In 
w. W. Covington and M. M. Moore 
the 1970s an average of 33,801 acres per year were burned by wildfire in 
the Southwest. Both Barrows (1978) and Swetnam (1990) observed that 
lightning-caused wildfires in the Southwest are getting larger and larger 
over time, with some fires reaching 10,000-20,000 acres, in contrast to the 
3,000 acre surface fires of presettlement times (Swetnam and Dieterich 
1985; Swetnam 1990). This represents a three- to six-fold increase in 
average fire size. Thus, we may be witnessing in the ponderosa pine type 
the kind of shift in size observed in the type two fire regimes, i.e., the 
coalescing of patches into larger and larger areas capable of supporting 
very large (> 10,000 acres) crown fires. 
There is little quantitative information on conditions of presettlement fo­
rests and woodlands of the Inland West (Covington et al. 1994b). The major 
writings and research in the southwestern ponderosa pine type deal only 
with tree densities. As mentioned earlier, Cooper (1960) cited the writings 
of early expedition leaders, Whipple (1856) and Beale (1858). They re­
ported that the condition of the southwestern ponderosa pine forest " ... 
was open and park-like with a dense grass cover." These early descriptions 
of the open nature of presettlement ponderosa pine forests are in agreement 
with results of recent research which found that canopy coverage by trees of 
presettlement origin range from 17% (Covington and Sackett 1986) to 22% 
(White 1985) of the surface area for unharvested sites near Flagstaff, AZ. In 
addition, Pearson (1923) noted that "rarely does [ponderosa pine] crown 
cover reach more than 30% and usually not over 25%." 
Cooper (1960) stated that the structure of the southwestern ponderosa 
pine type in the White Mountains of east-central Arizona is actually that of 
an all-aged forest composed of even-aged groups. He noted great variation 
in diameter within a single age class, Using contiguous quadrat analysis 
(Grieg-Smith 1952) in two stands, Cooper determined that the presettle­
ment trees aggregated into areas ranging from 0.16 to 0.32 acres. White 
(1985), in a study conducted on the Pearson Natural Area near Flagstaff, 
noted that successful establislunent of ponderosa pine in presettlement 
times was infrequent (as much as four decades between regeneration 
events). White also quantified the strong aggregation of ponderosa pine. 
Using the nearest neighbor method (Clark and Evans 1954), White dem­
onstrated that the aggregation ranged from 3 to 44 stems within a group, 
with a group occupying an area that ranged from 0.05-0.70 acres. "Ages 
of stems within a group were also variable with the most homogeneous 
group having a range of 33 years and the least having a range of 268 years 
(White 1985)." White's findings of a pattern of uneven-aged groups near 
Flagstaff are in contrast to the results of Cooper (1960) for the White 
Mountains. However, Cooper's subsequent observations have lead him to 

163 
162 ASSESSINGFORESTECOSYSTEMHEALTHIN THE 1NLAND WEST 
conclude that even-agedness in presettlement ponderosa forests was rare 
(C.F. Cooper, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA, personal com­
munication 1992). For the southwestern ponderosa pine type, therefore, 
the data suggest that, at the group-level, the trees are basically all-aged and 
have sporadic regeneration events (White 1985; Covington and Moore 
1994a). At the landscape and regional levels (square miles and larger in 
size), however, several studies have shown simultaneous regeneration 
events that were correlated with simultaneous surface fifes, and favorable 
climatic oscillations (e.g., La Nina [opposite pattern of El Nino], Kerr 
1988; Swetnam 1990; Savage 1989). 
Madany and West (1983) discussed the effects that many years of heavy 
grazing and fire suppression have had on ponderosa pine regeneration in 
southern Utah (Zion National Park). They suggested that ponderosa pine 
seedling survival was probably greater in the early 1900s than in the 
presettlement days due to reduced competition of grasses (through graz­
ing) with pine seedlings, and the reduced thinning effect that fifes once 
had on seedlings in presettlement times. 
Moir and Dieterich (1988) pointed out the importance of understanding 
the role of the natural, presettlement fire regime in directing successional 
processes toward ponderosa pine old-growth development and in keeping 
fuel loading low enough for large trees to survive wildfires . They stated 
that most of the old-growth in southwestern ponderosa pine forests has 
deteriorated because recurrent natural fifes have been suppressed. Finally, 
they present an eleven stage model of succession from open meadow 
through sapling, pole, yellow pine, and dead snag dominated landscape 
units. Although they do not describe the scale of these units, Cooper's 
(1960) and White's (1985) results indicate that these units were on the 
order of a few tenths of an acre. 
DETAILED ANALYSIS OF TWO STUDY AREAS  
IN ARIZONA PONDEROSA PINE  
To better understand postsettlernent changes in southwestern ponderosa 
pine, we studied changes in forest conditions for two areas in northern 
Arizona. One, the Bar-M study area, has soils of volcanic origin and is on 
the Mormon Lake Ranger District of the Coconino National Forest. The 
other has soils of limestone origin and is on the North Kaibab Ranger 
District of the Kaibab National Forest. More detailed descriptions of the 
study area and methods used are available in Covington and Moore 
(1994a) and Covington and Moore (in preparation).

Study Areas 
The Bar-M Canyon study area is located approximately 25 miles south 
of Flagstaff. The Bar-M watershed is part of the Mogollon Rim Plateau . It 
is a gently rolling landscape, dissected by many steep canyons. Elevations 
range from 6360-7710 feet. Our plots were located between 6800 and 
7200 feet. The bedrock underlying the area consists of igneous rocks of 
volcanic origin. The soils, developed on basalt and cinders, are mostly 
silty clays and silty clay loams less than 2.6 feet deep (Brown et al. 1974). 
The average annual precipitation for the area is 25.0 inches. There are 
two major precipitation seasons. Sixty-four percent of the precipitation 
falls during the winter-october through April. Thirty-two percent falls 
during the summer-particularly July and August (Brown et al. 1974). 
The North Kaibab study area is located on the Kaibab Plateau of north 
central Arizona, approximately 100-120 miles north of Flagstaff. Like 
Bar-M canyon it is a gently rolling landscape, dissected by steep canyons. 
The elevation of our plots ranged from 6800-7800 feet. The bedrock 
underlying the area consists primarily of Kaibab limestone. The soils, 
developed from limestone, are mostly sandy and gravelly loams and 
loams. Average annual precipitation for the North Kaibab ponderosa type 
is 22 inches (Brewer et al. 1991). Predominant vegetation composition of 
the study areas is described in Table 2. 
FieldProcedures 
On both sites we used a stratified systematic sampling procedure. The 
areas were stratified by soil type and topography, using the U.S. Forest 
Service Terrestrial Ecosystem (TE) Survey (USDA Forest Service 1987; 
Brewer et al. 1991). At Bar-M, map unit #582 was the most common 
soil-slope-vegetation unit (Typic Argiboroll and Mollie Eutroboralf; Low 
Sun Cold, with ponderosa pine and Gambel oak as the dominant trees, 
0-15% slope). Within the North Kaibab study area, map units #293 and 
#294 were the most common (Mollie Eutroboralf; Low Sun Cold, with 
ponderosa pine and Gambel oak as the dominant trees, 0-15% slope 
(#293) the most common and 14-40% slope (#294) also represented). 
At the Bar-M study area. seventy 0.62 acre (one-quarter hectare) plots 
were systematically located within map unit #582 . The large plot size was 
chosen to incorporate the patchy nature of ponderosa pine old-growth and 
for spatial analysis in the future. Sixty-two of these plots were labeled 
extensive; only the presettlement trees were sampled on these plots. All 
presettlement trees were stem-mapped (exact x,y location recorded on the 
plot). In addition to location, presettlement tree species, dbh, condition

(live, snags, stumps, and down), and density (number per acre and basal 
area) were recorded. 
Eight of these seventy 0.62 acre plots were sampled more intensively at 
Bar-M.lnformation on all trees was gathered on these plots. In addition to 
location, the species (live, snags, stumps, and down), size class (e.g., 
seedling, sapling, etc.), dbh, and density were also recorded. A ten percent 
W. w: Covington and M. M. Moore 
sample of all trees less than 14.6 and greater than 3.9 inches dbh was 
selected to determine an age distribution and approximate date of post­
settlement tree establishment. All trees greater than or equal to 14.6 inches 
were aged as was any pine tree with yellow bark. Our logic for these dbh 
and bark criteria was similar to that of White (1985) who determinedstatisti­
cally that the majority of presettlement ponderosa pine at a similar site 
would be > 14.6 in., and that those which were not would have yellow 
bark. This latter criterion is based on the observation that, in the Southwest 
ponderosa pine, bark changes color from "black" to "yellow" as the tree 
ages (Pearson 1950). 
At the North Kaibab study site we made our plot locations compatible 
with an earlier inventory (Lang and Stewart 1910). Our sample plots were 
located in the center of systematically selected quarter sections. Forty-six 
0.62 acre (0.25 ha) plots were located in TE map units #293 and #294. 
Presettlement trees were sampled on all plots, while additional informa­
tion on postsettlement trees was gathered on 36 of these plots. Data col­
lected and sampling techniques used were the same as described above for 
the Bar-M study site. The results for only 16 intensive plots (data on all 
trees) from the North Kaibab are presented in this paper because we are 
still analyzing the remainder. 
The tree rings of all presettlement trees from both study sites werecounted 
and measured to determine total tree age and to determine the diameter of 
each tree at a point before Euro-Arnerican settlement (l867-Bar M; 
1881-North Kaibab), and to determine average annual growth since settle­
ment. If the tree was a stump, snag, or down material then the year of death 
was estimated (Thomas 1979; Maser et al. 1979; Cunningham et al. 1980; 
Rogers et al. 1984), and the presettlement diameter calculated by regression. 
Simulation Models 
To understand how forest structure and patterns and resource conditions 
changed over time we linked the spatial data from the stem-mapped inten­
sive plots (8 from Bar-M and 16 from North Kaibab) to the ECOSIM 
multiresource forest growth and yield simulation model (Rogers et al. 
1984). The tree growth and yield model used in ECOSIM is based on the 
FREP/STEMS model (Belcher et al. 1985; Brand 1981) calibrated with 
continuous forest inventory data from Arizona and New Mexico. The 
water yield model is based on the "Baker-Kovner" model (Brown et al. 
1974) in which streamflow is a function of winter precipitation, aspect, 
slope, and tree density. For herbage production, a modification of Clary's 
(1978) model was used, where herbage is a function of annual precipita­
tion, tree density, and range site class. Forest floor accumulation is esti­

mated as the difference between litterfall (calculated from tree density and 
canopy biomass) and decomposition, using Fogel and Cromack's (1977) 
.estimates for ponderosa pine decomposition rates. Near-view scenic beauty 
is estimated using equations developed by Daniel and Boster (1976) and 
Schroeder and Daniel (198l). This index of scenic beauty is calculated as 
a function of number of large ( > 16 inch dbh) trees, number of mid-sized 
trees (5-16 inches dbh), amount of logging slash, amount of herbage, and 
amount of shrubs. For more detail on the simulation techniques the reader 
is referred to Rogers et al. (1984). 
Each simulation run consisted of entering the dbh of all presettlement 
trees (live trees, snags, downed trees and stumps) by diameter class as 
stand conditions in 1867 for Bar-M and 1881 for the North Kaibab. Settle­
ment of the Flagstaff area preceded that of the North Kaibab area, thus 
grazing and hence fire exclusion began earlier at the Bar-M study area. 
This paper is designed to examine the inherent properties of ponderosa 
pine population irruptions when fire is excluded; therefore we did not 
simulate historical tree harvesting in this analysis. This stands in contrast 
to our analytical procedure which included historical harvest at Bar-M 
published elsewhere (Covington and Moore 1994). 
After initialization to presettlement conditions, we entered trees into 
the stand at appropriate intervals in simulated time, based on the regen­
eration events inferred from the age distribution of the postsettlement 
trees. The output from these computer runs was a series of tables (from 
1867 or 1881 through 2021 or 2027) which quantitatively estimate the 
changes in forest density in southwestern ponderosa pine since Euro­
American settlement. This information on forest density was used to run 
fuel loading, herbage, water yield, and esthetics models (Rogers et al. 
1984). We used the model results to draw inferences about temporal 
changes in mulliresource conditions since European settlement and to 
forecast future trends. 
Results and Discussion 
Tree density at both study areas has increased greatly since the late 
1800s (Table 3). Presettlement tree density was higher by a factor of two 
on the North Kaibab study area than at the Bar-M study area. Postsettle­
ment tree density was much greater at Bar-M than at North Kaibab. How­
ever, because of the small sample size (8), the postsettlement tree densities 
at Bar-M should be viewed with caution. Our estimates of presettlement 
tree densities are consistent with estimates from other sources (Table 4). 
The results from the simulation model analysis are presented in Figures 
2 through 5. We initialized the simulation in 1867 for Bar-M (although we

begin plots at 1887 for chronological comparability with NKRD) and in 
1881 for North Kaibab as follows: I

1867 at Bar-M and 1881 at North Kaibab.

3. Soil rating factor =9 for Bar-M and 12 for North Kaibab, based on 
the forage production potential for map units #582, #293, and #294. 
Soil rating factor is an index varying from 0 for poor range sites to 
12 for the best. 
4. Fuel loading = 0.1 t/ac of fermentation + humus layers and 0.1 t/ac 
of litter layer of the forest floor. This is based on the fuel loading 
data from Covington and Sackett's (1986) 2-year interval prescribed 
burning plots in ponderosa pine with the assumption that tree 
canopy covered approximately 20% of the surface of the land (Cov­
ington and Sackett 1986; White 1985). 
5. For Bar-M, average annual precipitation = 25 inches; average annu­
al winter precipitation = 16.9 inches. This is the 22 year average for 
the ponderosa pine watersheds in the.Beaver Creek drainage (Camp­
bell and Ryan 1982). Precipitation was held constant throughout the 
simulation. For North Kaibab, average annual precipitation = 22 in­
ches; average annual winter precipitation = 12.1 inches, based on 
climatic data reported in the Terrestrial Ecosystem Survey (Brewer 
et al. 1991) for north Kaibab map units #293 and #294. 
To simulate the establishment of postsettlement trees we entered seed­
ling density corresponding with the number of postsettlement trees for 
each species. Seedlings were entered beginning at the point in simulated 
time which represented the earliest establishment data observed on the 
plot. Similarly, the last date of seedling establishment was used as the last 
seedling establishment date in simulated time. 
The results of the simulation model provide an estimate of how forest 
conditions have changed since Euro-American settlement in Arizona pon­
derosa pine type and how these trends might continue into the future 
(Figures 2-5). Increases in tree density through 1990 are estimated to have 
caused substantial declines in average herbage production (decreases of 
over 1,000 lbs/ac at Bar-M and 350 lbs/ac on the North Kaibab). This 
decreased herbage in conjunction with increased small diameter tree den­
sity has caused a striking decline in near-view scenic beauty (Covington and 
Moore 1994a). At the same time, forest floor and fuel loading is estimated 
to have increased from less than I t/ac before settlement to an average of

over 20 t/ac at both study areas. Vertical diversity, fuel ladder continuity 
(as estimated by diameter distribution of trees), and crown closure have 
also increased substantially (Figures 2-5). 
To estimate changes in wildlife habitat characteristics since 1867, we 
used the simulation output for tree density by diameter class to classify the 
simulated stand into vegetation structural stages (Thomas 1979) and then 
used the Forest Service Southwestern Region's forest planning wildlife 
report (Byford et al. 1984) to determine the change in relative habitat 
value from 1867 to the present. This analysis indicates that there has been 
a shift away from the grass-forb structural stage common in the late 1800's 
to a seedling dominated structural stage after the tum of the century, and 
then to mature timber and finally old-growth trees growing over dense 
sapling and poles from the I960s on. 
These changes in vegetation since settlement indicate a shift in foraging 
habitat from one favoring grassland/savannah species (e.g., pronghorn 
antelope, grasshoppers, bluebirds, and turkeys) to one favoring species 
feeding in dense forests (Abert squirrel, porcupine, bark beetle, pygmy 
nuthatches, and perhaps Mexican spotted owl). In sum, the shift in tree 
density seems to have favored species dependent on closed forest condi­
tions at the expense of those which require some portion of their habitat in 
grass/forb or savannah. Gruell et al. (1982) noted similar changes in wild­
life habitats for ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir forests in western Montana. 
Under the assumption that no substantial tree mortality occurs between 
1987 and 2027, many of these trends are predicted to continue (Figures 
2-5). Undoubtedly, the increased tree density is a key factor contributing to 
the increased occurrence of large crown fires in southwestern ponderosa 
pine (Barrows 1978; Swetnam 1990). Fire simulation studies of ponderosa 
pine and related forest types (van Wagtendonk 1985; Keane et al. 1990) 
are consistent with these conclusions. 
Furthermore, increased density is responsible for decreased growth rates 
of presettlement trees (Sutherland 1983), and hence decreased vigor (War­
ing 1983), which increases susceptibility to bark beetle attack (Sartwell 
1971; Sartwell and Stevens 1975) and other agents of mortality. Numerous 
studies have demonstrated that the mortality of ponderosa pine increases 
with both diameter and stand density (McTague 1990). A trend toward 
increasing rates of mortality, especially of the largest and oldest presettle­
ment trees, is supported by an analysis of the Pearson Natural Area data 
(Covington and Moore 1994a). 
Thus, the increase in tree density following Euro-American settlement 
has resulted, on the one hand, in a major increase in forest canopy cover 
and vertical diversity within the tree canopies, and on the other hand 

175 
i74 ASSESSiNG FOREST ECOSYSTEM HEALTH IN THE INLAND WEST 
striking decreases in herbage production. Our results are consistent with 
studies in Interior (Gruell et al. 1982; Keane et al. 1990) and California (van 
Wagtendonk 1985; Laudenslayer et al. 1989) ponderosa pine forests which 
describe changes in tree density, fuel loads, wildlife habitat, and esthetics 
after rue exclusion. Of particular concern is the increased risk of mortality, 
especially for the oldest age classes of presettlement trees, from crown rue, 
bark beetles, and other agents (such as root rot), and the implications for 
old-growth forest management in the ponderosa pine type. 
IMPLICATIONS FOR OW-GROWTH ECOWGY  
AND MANAGEMENT  
Disruptions of natural disturbance regimes coupled with postsettlement 
anthropogenic disturbances have led to forest and woodland conditions 
which may bear little resemblance to natural conditions. Thus, old-growth 
definitions and management objectives based only on current stand struc­
ture may not be compatible with the conservation biology goal of preserv­
ing species diversity by providing for the habitats in which species have 
evolved (Hunter 1991). In fact, detailed analysis of tree density, size, crown 
closures, and down logs indicates that, before settlement, none of the plots 
sampled at Bar-M nor at the North Kaibab would meet all of the current 
minimum criteria for old-growth used in the Southwest) (USDA Forest 
Service 1992). In addition, when we compared the current conditions of 
the 36 intensive plots on the North Kaibab (all were site index 70-80) to 
these same criteria for old-growth, only three plots met the old-growth 
trees/acre requirements; however, in all three cases only half of the domi­
nant trees met the 180 year requirement, and only one of these plots met 
the snag, while none met the down log, requirement 
Setting aside old-growth ponderosa pine stands which most closely 
meet current old-growth definitions may have unexpected consequences . 
These stands that have higher than normal canopy closures when compared 
to presettlement times are likely to be the most susceptible to crown fire. 
low tree vigor, and mortality from drought, insects, and diseases. Further 
deterioration from natural conditions is inevitable if restorative actions are 
not taken immediately. 
1.Minimum structural attributes for old-growth inventory in the USDA Forest 
Service's Southwestern Region-for high sites (Minor site index > 55): large 
dorninant/codominant trees-20 trees/acre ~ 18 inches dbh; average 180 years; 
total tree basal area of 90 ft2/acre; total canopy cover of 50%; dead tree compo­
nent of 1 snag/acre of 14 inches dbh and 25 feet in length; 2 down logs/acre of 12 
inches dbhand 15 feet in length; canopie s single or multiple storied.

Thus, defmitions of old-growth should take into account natural condi­
tions before Euro-American settlement, particularly the natural rue regime 
and patchy nature of the forest. In managing toward natural (using pre­
settlement conditions as the "yardstick") old-growth, it will be necessary 
to design and apply treatments for restoring candidate stands (e.g., thin­
ning from below, manual fuel treatments, prescribed burning). 
RESTORATION  
OF SOUTHWESTERN PONDEROSA PINE  
To summarize, numerous lines of evidence point to striking postsettle­
ment changes in southwestern ponderosa pine forests. A combination of 
livestock grazing, fire exclusion, and logging disturbances has resulted in 
increases in tree density, canopy closure, vertical diversity, aerial fuel 
continuity, and surface fuel loads. At the same time, herbaceous and shrub 
production have likely declined. As a consequence, the forests of today 
differ substantially from the natural conditions before Euro-American 
settlement. These changes in ecosystem structure imply changes in wild­
life habitat, water relations, nutrient cycling, soils, species diversity, eco­
system health, and other resource characteristics. 
Furthermore, these changes in ponderosa pine structure have led to a 
shift away from the natural fire regime of frequent, low intensity surface 
rues to high intensity crown fires. Most recently, the occurrence of larger 
and larger crown fires in the ponderosa pine type may indicate a further 
shift to a regime characterized by very large ( > 10,000 acre) crown flres. 
To remedy these problems and restore these forests to more natural 
conditions immediate action is essential. Although it is beyond the scope 
of this paper to recommend specific ecological restoration prescriptions, 
sufficient understanding (both scientific and expert knowledge) exists for 
developing and testing site specific ecological restoration hypotheses at 
levels in the landscape hierarchy from small plots to entire landscapes. For 
example, in southwestern ponderosa pine/bunchgrass ecosystems such as 
those reported in this paper, existing knowledge indicates that in dense 
sites with heavy forest floor accumulations , heavy fuels must be removed 
from the base of large, old trees (or larger replacement postsettlement trees 
in the absence of old-growth), periodic burning must be reintroduced, and 
native understory species must be reestablished. 
However, simultaneous with widescale restoration treatments, it is nec­
essary to determine postsettlement changes in ecological conditions (Bon­
nicksen and Stone 1985) for a broader range (e.g., a variety of soil types, 
topographies, and vegetation types) of forest and woodland types in the 

177 
176 ASSESSING FOREST ECOSYSTEM HEALTH IN THE INLAND WEST 
Rocky Mountain and Southwest regions. Then a combination of an adap­
tive resource management approach (Walters 1986) and process-oriented 
simulation modeling (e.g., van Wagtendonk 1985; Keane et al. 1990; 
Covington and Moore I994a) could be used to design restoration manage­
ment regimes appropriate for each set of conditions. Simultaneously, small 
(10-20 acre) plot studies could be established to examine the ecological 
effects and practicality of various restoration treatment scenarios. Using 
such an integration of historical studies, simulation modeling, and man­
agement experiment approaches should ensure that we address our wild­
land management issues in a more coherent and ecologically sound man­
ner.
