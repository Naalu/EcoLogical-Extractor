Fact Sheet: How Much Is Forest Restoration Worth? 
An Example from Southwestern Ponderosa Pine Forests 
 
 
Implementing forest restoration treatments is expensive, but so is attempting to control the severe 
crown fires that can take place in overly dense ponderosa pine forests. How do these costs 
compare? 
 
The costs of severe wildfires can be staggering when all damage is considered. For example, 
a full-cost accounting of costs of the 2000 Cerro Grande Fire in New Mexico reached $1 billion 
in 2004. Variables considered in full-cost accounting for catastrophic wildfire include:  
 
• Loss of lives 
• Costs of fire suppression 
• Destroyed or damaged homes and infrastructure 
• Degraded wildlife and human habitats 
• Degraded watersheds and water supplies 
• Damaged recreation facilities 
• Evacuation costs 
• Tourism losses 
• Burned timber 
• Damaged cultural and archaeological sites 
• Rehabilitation and restoration costs 
• Public health costs 
 
Restoring forests and avoiding catastrophic fire results in an array of resource benefits. 
Restoring overly dense ponderosa pine forests can result in a wide array of ecological and 
resource benefits. This analysis is based on the following treatment types: 
 
• No treatment: no thinning or prescribed burning  
• Full restoration: thinning excess trees to restore natural tree density as it was before 
widespread logging, livestock grazing, and fire exclusion 
• Partial restoration: thinning excess trees, but leaving 1.5 to 2 times as many trees as are 
needed to restore natural tree density 
• Intermediate restoration: thinning excess trees, but leaving 3 to 5 times as many trees as 
are needed to restore natural tree density 
• Minimal restoration: thinning excess trees, but leaving 6 to 8 times as many trees as are 
needed to restore natural tree density

Restored forests produce greater economic benefits. To estimate the economic value of this 
range of restoration treatment alternatives for wood products, forage, and water production, we 
have applied the above yield values to four million acres of ponderosa pine forest. We have also 
calculated costs saved in not having to fight high-severity wildfires or rehabilitate burned areas. 
Four million acres is equivalent to approximately one-half of the ponderosa pine acreage in 
Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado, and one-tenth of the total ponderosa pine acreage 
nationally.

The bottom line. Forest management decisions have both ecological and economic implications. 
They matter. 
• Full restoration across four million acres in the Southwest would produce $10.6 billion 
more in resource benefits than doing nothing. 
• Benefits fall off sharply as trees are left in excess of the land’s natural carrying capacity. 
• Even without considering other benefits, it makes sense to spend $2,650 per acre to 
restore ponderosa pine forests and avoid catastrophic wildfire. 
• A full-cost accounting that takes into account all costs of a severe wildfire would justify 
spending more than this.

ecosystem health in ponderosa pine forests of the Southwest. Journal of Forestry 95(4):23-29. This paper reports on a partial 
restoration treatment in which no trees over 16 inches dbh were cut, with a resulting residual tree density (trees greater than 4 
inches dbh) that was approximately two times greater than what was present in 1876, before fire regime disruption. 
Approximately 5,500 board-feet/acre were removed. Had excess postsettlement trees greater than 16 inches dbh been cut, an

additional 3 trees per acre consisting of 1,000 board-feet would have been cut, on average, resulting in a total of 6,500 board-
feet/acre. The intermediate and minimal thinning yields are based on unpublished data from tenth-acre plots located in 
intermediate and minimal restoration treatments in the Fort Valley Experimental Forest near Flagstaff.

800 pounds of forage.

stream/riparian systems. Flagstaff: Northern Arizona University. This table uses $250/acre-foot, which is a midrange estimate. At 
the upper end, published analyses identify values of from $400 to $1,728/acre-foot. 
 
7 Wildfire costs savings are from D. L. Lynch. 2004. What do forest fires really cost? Journal of Forestry 102(9):42-49. This 
analysis uses the $1,500/acre costs of the Hayman Fire in valuing full restoration and partial restoration, one-eighth of that for 
intermediate restoration, and $0 for minimal treatment. To approximate fire suppression costs alone (without other fire costs), 
divide by five.
