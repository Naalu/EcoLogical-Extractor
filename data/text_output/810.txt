Te Ecological Restoration Institute
Te Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University is a pioneer in researching, implementing, 
and monitoring ecological restoration of southwestern ponderosa pine forests. Tese forests have been signiﬁcantly 
altered over the last century, with decreased ecological and recreational values, near-elimination of natural low-
intensity ﬁre regimes, and greatly increased risk of large-scale ﬁres. Te ERI is working with public agencies and 
other partners to restore these forests to a more ecologically healthy condition and trajectory—in the process 
helping to signiﬁcantly reduce the threat of catastrophic wildﬁre and its eﬀects on human, animal, and plant 
communities.

Types of contracts and mechanisms used for restoration work
Tool
Application
Timber sale contracts
Used to sell timber from national forest lands. The contract describes 
how the purchaser buys, pays for, harvests, and removes the wood.
Service (procurement) 
contracts
Used to buy services such as tree planting, pre-commercial thinning, 
trail maintenance, and stream restoration. The contract describes the 
work to be done and the time period in which it will be completed. 
Integrated resource 
contracts
Used exclusively for implementing stewardship contracting projects   
IRCs combine aspects of both timber sale and service contracts 
and must be awarded on a best-value basis. They may also include 
provisions for the exchange of goods-for-services, the retention 
of receipts, multi-year contracting, designation by description or 
prescription, and other special stewardship authorities.
Participating 
agreements
Used to allow volunteer organizations or individuals to work on 
projects with the Forest Service. 
Administrative use 
agreements 
Used to dispose of timber from national forest lands when there is 
some administrative beneit to the Forest Service. 
Watershed restoration & 
enhancement (Wyden) 
agreements
Allows the Forest Service to fund watershed improvement projects on 
non-federal land. 
Title II & Title III projects 
(Secure Rural Schools 
& Community Self-
Determination Act 
Projects) 
Used to fund county-approved projects that beneit federal resources.

uring the past ten years, the array of administrative tools available to the Forest Service 
for restoration has changed and been enhanced. This guide provides an overview of 
the contracts, agreements, and permits available to pursue restoration work on national 
forests, and provides contractors with information on how to find and bid on restoration 
contracts.
Traditionally, the Forest Service had two distinct types of contracts—timber sales (designed to 
sell government property) and service contracts (designed to purchase goods and services from 
businesses). As the Forest Service has intensiied its focus on restoration activities, new stewardship 
contracting formats have been developed that combine the purchase of goods and services with 
the sale of timber. This paper covers four categories of contracts: timber sale, service, integrated 
resource (stewardship), and delivered log.
Timber sale contracts
When the Forest Service sells timber from national forest lands, it most often does so through 
a timber sale contract, “an agreement entered into by the Forest Service and the purchaser with 
speciic expectations of beneits to be received and obligations to be performed.”1 The contract 
establishes the terms and conditions under which the agency sells the timber and the purchaser 
buys, pays for, harvests, and removes it.
In preparing a timber sale, the Forest Service appraises the material being offered to estimate the 
fair market value of the timber and set an advertised rate that will encourage suficient competition 
for the sale. Transaction evidence appraisal (TEA) is the primary method used, although for small 
sales other valid methods (comparison with similar sale offerings or the use of standard rates) may 
be used instead.2  TEA arrives at fair market value based on the bid rates on prior timber sales 
sold competitively over a period of time. The volume-weighted average of those bids is adjusted 
to account for differences in sale conditions, values, and costs between base period sales and the 
sale currently being appraised. That is the “indicated advertised rate” or “minimum allowable bid.” 
The “base rate” is the lowest rate at which timber is advertised (even if the appraisal calculations 
would indicate a lower rate), and is the higher of (1) the applicable minimum rates established by 
the forest service region, by species, or (2) the minimum deposit to the National Forest Fund of 
$0.25 per hundred cubic feet (CCF), plus the cost of any required reforestation work.3 
There are six “2400”-type timber sale contract formats for harvesting standing trees as well as one 
for the sale of decked timber. The type of contract used depends upon the volume and complexity 
of the sale, whether the timber is measured for payment before or after it is harvested, the length

TRADITIONAL CONTRACTS

of the contract, and other factors (see Appendix for more information about the various 
contract formats, their similarities and differences, and when each is used). There is no 
regulatory limit on the volume or value of a timber sale, but a timber sale contract can run 
no longer than ten years. 4  
The National Forest Management Act requires the Forest Service to advertise all timber sales 
unless the appraised value of a sale is less than $10,000 or in “extraordinary conditions” as 
deined by the Secretary of Agriculture, exist.5 
  
The Forest Service provides information about available timber sales in a number of ways. 
For a timber sale with an appraised value of $10,000 or more, the Forest Service publishes 
a sale advertisement in a local newspaper for 30 days. A sale deemed to be of “unusual 
interest” is also advertised in trade journals for 45 to 90 days.6 
A timber sale advertisement speciies the project location, the 
estimated quantities of products being offered, any related 
road construction required, the bidding method being used, 
the date bids will be due, and other important information.7 
A prospective bidder letter is mailed at roughly the same 
time to inform prospective bidders that a timber sale is being 
offered and that a complete bid package is available upon 
request.
When weather conditions could render the project area 
inaccessible at the time of the normal advertisement, the 
agency may publish a preliminary advertisement to alert 
contractors and other interested parties about a sale that it 
intends to advertise at a later time. This gives bidders an 
opportunity to visit the sale area in advance to familiarize 
themselves with site conditions and to make their own estimates of the volume, condition, 
and value of the timber to be offered—critical steps in preparing a bid.
Prospective bidders or other interested parties should request a prospectus. The prospectus 
provides additional information (contract format to be used, required deposits, description 
of any special logging requirements, etc.) to enable bidders to decide whether or not to 
further investigate the sale. If they decide to go ahead, they need to get the bid package, 
which includes the bid form, sale area map, and other detailed information.
The Forest Service requires bidders to provide sealed bids in Regions 8 and 9 and uses 
a combination of sealed bids and oral auctions in Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 “to the 
extent of historical use.”8  To participate in an oral auction, bidders must submit a written 
sealed bid at least equal to the minimum acceptable bid prices speciied in the prospectus. 
No price less than the written sealed bid amount will be accepted in the oral auction. A bid 
guarantee (cash, bid bond, letter of credit, or other acceptable instrument) is required, and 
is returned to bidders whose bids are not accepted.

Unless the agency rejects all bids, it must award the sale to the bidder submitting the 
highest bid that conforms to the conditions of the sale. If no satisfactory bid is received or 
the bidder fails to complete the purchase, the Forest Service may sell the timber for no less 
than its appraised value without further advertisement.9 
Service Contracts
To purchase services that do not involve the 
removal of saleable timber—activities such 
as tree planting, pre-commercial thinning, 
trail maintenance, and stream restoration—
the Forest Service uses a procurement (or 
acquisition) process often referred to as 
service contracting. Unlike timber sales, 
which are regulated under the agency-
speciic National Forest Management Act, 
service contracts are regulated under the 
government-wide Federal Acquisition Regulations (FARs).and are also subject to the wage 
requirements of the Service Contract Act. 
Service contract offers are generally solicited in one of three ways: an invitation for bid, 
request for proposal, or request for quotation. Today, most service contracts are solicited 
through requests for proposals or quotations, negotiated contracts typically referred to as 
“best value” contracts.
Invitation for Bid (IFB). An IFB is a sealed bid process used for procuring goods or services 
whose value is estimated to exceed $100,000. The Forest Service must award the contract 
to the lowest-priced responsive and responsible bidder. The Forest Service rarely uses the 
IFB bidding mechanism, usually using a request for proposal for its large contracts.
Request for Proposal (RFP). An RFP is used for negotiated procurements estimated to 
exceed $100,000. Requests for proposal require formal, written responses that include a 
technical proposal as well as a price proposal. The agency evaluates the offers based on 
both price and non-price factors to determine the overall best value to the government, 
which may or may not be the lowest priced offer. The complexity of the technical proposal 
varies considerably from contract to contract and can include how and when the bidder 
will perform activities, the equipment proposed to be used, the bidder’s quality-control 
procedures, and the like. Past performance is always used as an evaluation factor when 
the cost is expected to exceed $100,000 or when the solicitation includes bundled work 
items.   
 
Request for Quotation (RFQ). An RFQ is similar to an RFP but is used for procurements 
estimated to have a value of less than $100,000 (or less than $5 million for commercial 
goods and services solicitations).10  With an RFQ, the Forest Service has considerable 
latitude in choosing the factors it will evaluate when awarding contracts, and often only past 
performance and price are considered. However, the agency may also ask for a technical 
proposal, including a description of the skills and experience of the personnel who will 

5
Forest Service Contracting: A Basic Guide for Restoration Practitioners
perform the various contract activities. Although the Forest Service may accept verbal 
offers, it almost always asks for written proposals on restoration projects.
Procurement solicitations specify the Forest Service’s requirements for a project, the 
anticipated terms and conditions that will apply, the information required to be in the 
offeror’s proposal, the factors that will be used to evaluate the offer, and the relative 
importance of each factor. In some cases, offerors may be allowed to propose alternative 
approaches to achieving the desired results. After offers are received, the Forest Service 
can ask offerors to clarify or expand upon their responses. Sometimes oral negotiations are 
held with those offerors determined to be 
in the “competitive range.” Offerors may 
modify their technical or price proposals 
or withdraw their offers at any time before 
a contract is awarded.
Unlike timber sales, nearly all Forest 
Service procurement contracts are “set 
aside” for small businesses; that is, only 
small businesses are eligible to submit an 
offer on them. The U.S. Small Business 
Administration establishes the size standards for “small” businesses. For support activities 
for forestry—nearly all non-construction restoration activities—a small business is deined 
as one having less than $6.5 million in annual revenue.  A business principally engaged in ire 
suppression and fuels management (including thinning) may have up to $16.5 million in annual 
revenue and still be considered “small.”  A business engaged in logging activities is considered 
small if it employs less than 500 employees.  Other size standards can be found on the web at  
www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/tableofsize/index.
html.
Congress has given the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management special direction 
regarding the minimum criteria that should be used in evaluating “best value” for certain 
types of contracts covered by FAR. There are additional allowances for National Fire 
Plan contracts and Stewardship Contracting. (For an extensive description of best value 
provisions for stewardship contracting, see Best Value Contracting in Stewardship 
Contracting: Meeting Ecological and Community Objectives, published by Sustainable 
Northwest and the Flathead Economic Policy Center.) 
Advertising Procurement Contracts
The Forest Service must advertise all invitations for bids and requests for proposals on 
the federal procurement contracting web site, www.fedbizopps.gov. The agency typically 
advertises its requests for quotations as well, although it is not required to do so for small 
contracts.

Service Contracts Types
A variety of contract types are used in service contracting:
Firm, ixed-price 
contracts
The most frequently used contracts, they specify a deinite 
quantity of work to be accomplished.
Hourly rate contracts
Occasionally issued, with a cap (maximum price) set on the 
contract
Indeinite-quantity 
contracts
Used when the Forest Service does not know the precise 
amount of supplies needed or services to be performed. The 
contract speciies (1) a minimum quantity that the agency 
is required to order, (2) an estimated quantity the agency 
believes it will order and uses to evaluate the offers, and 
(3) a maximum quantity that cannot be exceeded. A ixed 
contract period is designated, and task or delivery orders 
are used to identify the speciic work to be performed.
Requirements 
contracts
Used when there is no minimum quantity, just an estimated 
quantity and a maximum quantity. In exchange for having 
no guaranteed minimum quantity, the contractor receives all 
orders for supplies or services procured under the contract. 
Requirements contracts are implemented through task or 
delivery orders.
Performance-based 
contracts
Used for services that can be deined in terms of objective 
and measurable performance outcomes (end results). The 
contractor is paid based on the attainment of predetermined 
contractual goals. The work requirement is described in 
terms of what is to be accomplished, the quality standards 
the contractor must meet, how the agency will measure the 
quality standards, and how the contractor’s performance 
will be monitored. This allows contractors to determine 
how to meet the performance objectives, ensures that 
quality levels are achieved, and ties payment to successful 
performance.11

Forest Service Contracting: A Basic Guide for Restoration Practitioners
Stewardship Contracts
In 1998, Congress authorized “stewardship end-result contracting,” commonly referred 
to as stewardship contracting, on a limited demonstration basis, “to perform services 
to achieve land management goals for the national forests that meet local and rural 
community needs.”12  This soon proved to be a lexible implementation tool well suited to 
accomplishing restoration work. In 2003, stewardship contracting’s demonstration status 
was removed and the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) were 
granted general authority until September 30, 2013, to enter into stewardship contracting 
projects via agreement or contract “with 
private persons or other public or private 
entities.”13 
Any 
projects 
using 
stewardship 
contracting authorities must be awarded 
on a best value basis. That is, “in the 
Government’s estimation, [it] provides 
the greatest overall beneit in response 
to the requirements of the acquisition. It 
is the process of selecting a contractor 
based on price and non-price criteria. 
Evaluation factors may include, but are not limited to, the contractor’s past performance, 
work quality, existing public or private agreements or contracts, on-time delivery, 
experience, technical approach, and beneits to the local community.”14 
Other important stewardship contracting authorities include:
Goods for services. The Forest Service and BLM may apply the value of timber 
or other forest products removed as an offset against any services received from 
the contractor.
Retention of receipts. Funds received from the sale of forest products or vegetation 
removed under a stewardship contract may be retained by the agencies and used 
for other appropriate work on the same or other stewardship project locations.
Multi-year contracting. Contracts used to implement stewardship projects may 
have terms of up to ten years.
Designation by prescription. The agency can specify the end result expected to 
be achieved on the ground and then allow the contractor to propose the methods 
to be used to achieve that result, including which individual trees to cut. This 
authority enables land managers and contractors to more effectively deal with 
unique or changing forest conditions, and takes better advantage of qualiied 
contractors’ professional skills and knowledge.
INNOVATIVE AND NEW CONTRACTS

Forest Service Contracting: A Basic Guide for Restoration Practitioners
8
Stewardship contracting can be implemented through the use of a service contract or a 
modiied (to include a best value award) timber sale contract, or some combination thereof 
(see “Delivered Log Contracting,” below). The Forest Service also created four new 
templates to be used in stewardship contracting when the good-for-services authority is 
being utilized. Those are:
Integrated Resource Service Contracts are used when the cost of the services 
provided exceeds the value of the timber removed. There are two IRC-Service 
contract forms, one used when timber is measured before removal (tree 
measurement) and one for when timber is measured after harvest (scaled). 
For contracts greater than $2,500, Service Contract Act wage rates apply.  For 
construction contracts greater than $2,000, Davis-Bacon Act wage rates apply.15 
Integrated Resource Timber Contracts are used when the value of the timber 
exceeds the cost of the services. The 2400-13T contract form is used when the 
timber is measured before removal (tree measurement), and the 2400-13 contract 
form when the timber is measured after harvest (scaled). Davis-Bacon wage rates 
do not apply for speciied road construction and reconstruction performed by the 
contractor. Service Contract Act wage rates do not apply to product removal or to 
the procurement side of the contract.16 
All four contract templates, together with agency directions for their use, are available at 
www.fs.fed.us/forestmanagement/projects/stewardship/contracts/index.shtml.  In addition 
to the four IRC contracts, a conventional service contract may also be used in stewardship 
contracting projects.17  
Stewardship credits
One unique element of stewardship contracts is the use of “stewardship credits.” Credits 
are earned by the contractor upon completion of each service activity and can then be 
exchanged for timber of equal value. When the total value of the timber exceeds the total 
service costs, the contractor may either be required to perform additional service work or 
to provide a cash payment for the additional timber value. When the cost of the services 
exceeds the value of the timber, the Forest Service pays the contractor the difference.
Special considerations in stewardship contracting
Many stewardship contracting restoration projects include a variety of activities, such as 
timber harvest; road construction, maintenance, or removal; treatment of noxious weeds; 
installation and/or removal of culverts; stream restoration; isheries or wildlife habitat 
improvement; hazardous fuels reduction; and prescribed burning. Preparing a bid proposal 
encompassing multiple and diverse tasks requires more time and is more complex than 
submitting a single-price bid on a timber sale. Contractors who have worked primarily 
on timber sale projects in the past and now wish to bid on a project using stewardship 
contracting may ind they need to expand their technical and operational capabilities either 
in-house or through the use of subcontractors. Subcontracting is an attractive option for 

9
Forest Service Contracting: A Basic Guide for Restoration Practitioners
contractors who may not want to or be able to take on responsibility for an entire project, or 
who operate primarily in “niche” markets, such as tree planting. Most stewardship projects 
provide some degree of preference for contractors who submit a plan for hiring in the local 
area and/or providing other economic beneits to the community.
Delivered log contracts
Delivered log contracting uses the stewardship authorities, a service contract, and one 
or more separate, modiied timber sale/log purchase agreements. The restoration/service 
work is bid on a per-acre, end-result basis. The service contractor has no economic interest 
in any trees he or she removes in order to achieve that result. The timber is sold separately 
(on the stump or from the deck) to one or more purchasers, with the receipts of the sale(s) 
retained by the agency to help offset the cost of future service contract work.  Some of the 
advantages cited by the proponents of this mechanism are: (1) it enables the contractor to 
concentrate on achieving the desired condition on the ground, without regard to the value 
(or lack of it) of the trees removed; (2) it eliminates any incentive to remove more trees 
than necessary in order to achieve the desired condition; (3) it lets timber purchasers bid on 
only the products they want, rather than having to bid on an entire sale; and (4) it should 
maximize both the utilization of any timber removed and the value received for it by the 
government.18 
OTHER AUTHORITIES AND CONTRACTING MECHANISMS
In addition to the contracting tools described above, several other mechanisms have been 
developed to assist federal land management agencies in carrying out comprehensive 
restoration projects. Agreements and permits allow the agencies to use a variety of other 
entities to implement projects. Some programs provide direct funding to restoration projects. 
The following brief descriptions should help communities and practitioners understand the 
full range of tools available to help them participate in the design and/or implementation 
of restoration projects.
Participating agreements for forestry protection
Participating agreements are used for projects carried out by the Forest Service and one 
or more voluntary cooperators (public or private agencies, organizations, institutions, or 
individuals) who formalize the relationship by entering into a legal agreement. The Forest 
Service and the cooperator(s) share the project costs and receive mutual non-monetary 
beneits. The statutes authorizing such agreements don’t specify matching contribution 
percentages, but the Forest Service strives to achieve a dollar-for-dollar match from the 
cooperator(s).
Eligible activities include fuels management, insect and disease control, noxious weed 
control, tree planting and seeding, erosion control, abandoned mine reclamation, land 
restoration, hazardous material identiication, water testing and protection, and air 
pollution abatement. For example, a local non-proit group might sponsor and supervise 

Forest Service Contracting: A Basic Guide for Restoration Practitioners
10
a group of young people carrying out projects on a 
national forest—stabilizing streambanks, planting 
trees, seeding native grasses, and relocating a trail away 
from a riparian area. The youth would learn about their 
environment and gain job skills while improving forest 
conditions in their area. The non-proit group would 
beneit by furthering its organizational goal of helping 
youth learn about good land stewardship and become 
more employable, and the national forest would beneit 
from the resource improvement.
Administrative use permits
In some circumstances the Forest Service may dispose 
of timber through administrative use permits instead of 
timber sales, and in some instances these can be used to 
aid restoration activities. “Trees, portions of trees, or 
other forest products in any amount on National Forest System lands may be disposed of for 
administrative use, by sale or without charge, as may be most advantageous to the United States. 
. . .” 19
Administrative use of timber includes its use in construction or maintenance of Forest 
Service improvements (roads,  bridges,  buildings,  etc.),  for fuel in federal facilities,  for 
research and demonstration projects, for public disaster relief work, and “to protect or 
enhance multiple-use values in a particular area.”20  The maximum allowable volume in a 
single administrative use contract is one million board feet. If the appraised value is less 
than the published “minimum rates” for timber sales, the timber can be sold at its appraised 
value, down to a minimum of $50 per thousand board feet. As in regular timber sales, 
agency personnel deine the cutting area and mark or designate the trees for removal.
If the timber to be removed has no market value, or if its removal has a “compensating 
beneit” to the government, the timber can be made available without charge under 
“administrative free use.” District rangers are authorized to grant free use of timber to 
individuals up to $200 in value in any one iscal year, and forest supervisors may grant 
permits for material not exceeding $5,000 in value in one year.
Watershed Restoration and Enhancement (Wyden) Agreements
In 1998, Senator Ron Wyden added an amendment to a bill allowing the Forest Service 
“to enter into cooperative agreements with willing Federal, Tribal, State, and local 
governments, private and nonproit entities and landowners for the protection, restoration 
and enhancement of ish and wildlife habitat, and other resources on public or private 
land, the reduction of risk from natural disaster where public safety is threatened, or a 
combination thereof or both that beneit these resources within the watershed.”21  The 
agreements must include the terms and conditions agreed to between the Forest Service 
and the landowner and/or other implementing entities, including how the goals of the 
legislation will be met and how project costs will be shared among the parties.

11
Forest Service Contracting: A Basic Guide for Restoration Practitioners
Types of projects on non-Forest Service land that could qualify for federal money under 
the Wyden Amendment include in-stream restoration work and the clearing of ire-prone 
brush adjacent to national forest lands.22 
Titles II and III of the Secure Rural Schools and 
Community Self-Determination Act of 2000
Since 1908, the federal government has paid the states between one-quarter and one-half 
of the revenues received from National Forest System lands, with the payments to be used 
(primarily for schools and road maintenance) by the counties in which those federal lands 
are located. The steep decline in federal timber sales since the late 1980s has decreased 
revenues to local governments revenues as well. In response, Congress passed the “Secure 
Schools” Act in 2000 to stabilize payments to counties to “make additional investments 
in, and create additional employment opportunities through projects that improve the 
maintenance of existing infrastructure, implement stewardship objectives that enhance 
forest ecosystems, and restore and improve land health and water quality.”23 
Participating counties may elect to use up to 20 percent of the funds received for “Special 
Projects on Federal Lands” (Title II) or “County Projects” (Title III). Title II requires the 
creation of a broadly representative Resource Advisory Committee (RAC) that reviews 
projects proposed by the county or other entities and makes funding recommendations. The 
Forest Service implements the projects and is responsible for complying with all applicable 
laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act. 
Project funds can be used for cooperative agreements with other government agencies, 
private and nonproit entities, and landowners for protection, restoration, and enhancement 
of ish and wildlife habitat and other resource objectives. Projects may be conducted on 
non-federal land if they beneit resources on 
federal lands. Best-value contracting may 
be used in awarding Title II contracts.
Project proposals can be prepared and 
submitted through the national “Payments 
to States” website, wwwnotes.fs.fed.us:81/
r4/payments_to_states.nsf, 
which 
also 
provides contact information for each RAC 
as well as the names of RAC members 
and designated agency oficials for the 
program.
Title III projects are conducted directly 
by electing counties, and may fund search, 
rescue, and emergency services; community 
service work camps; forest-related, after-school programs; the purchase of easements for 
conservation or to provide non-motorized access to public lands for recreational purposes; 
education of homeowners about wildﬁre and techniques for reducing potential losses; 
community planning eﬀorts to increase the protection of people and property from wildﬁre; 
and payment of the non-federal match for the Forest Service’s Urban and Community 
Forestry Assistance programs.

R Be proactive. 
To identify contracting opportunities, visit FedBizOpps (www.
fedbizopps.gov), attend local RAC meetings, and talk to the 
Forest Service timber sale and acquisitions contracting oicers 
about upcoming oﬀerings. In FedBizOpps you can register to 
receive emails for certain types of projects. Tis can be beneﬁcial in 
that you won’t need to search every Region and Forest for the type 
of contractsthat interest you. Attend agency “show me” tours, open 
houses, and other events where planned projects are discussed, 
and you have an opportunity to ask questions and increase your 
understanding of agency goals and priorities. Get involved in the 
collaborative process. Tis process is mandatory for all stewardship 
projects.
R Get registered.
Te HUBZone Empowerment Contracting Program stimulates 
economic development and creates jobs in economically distressed 
counties by providing preference in federal contracting to qualiﬁed 
small businesses. Tese preferences go to small businesses that 
obtain HUBZone (Historically Underutilized Business Zone) 
certiﬁcation. To qualify for the program, a business must meet the 
following criteria:
•  It must be a small business by SBA size standards;
• Its principal oice must be located within a HUBZone, which 
includes economically distressed counties and lands on 
federally recognized Indian reservations;
• It must be owned and controlled by one or more U.S. 
citizens. Approved ownership can also be by a Community 
Development Corporation or Indian tribe; and
•  At least 35% of its employees must reside in a HUBZone.
Te U.S. Small Business Administration administers the HUBZone 
program. To learn more about it, ﬁnd out if you’re in a HUBZone, 
or ﬁle for certiﬁcation, go to www.sba.gov/hubzone.
Te Central Contractor Registration (CCR) is the primary 
vendor database for the U.S. Government. Both current and 
prospective government vendors, including those who may enter 
into contracts or agreements with the government, are required 
to register and provide certain basic information about their 
organizations. Vendors must update their registration annually to 
maintain an active status. For more information and to complete a 
registration form, go to www.ccr.gov.
To register on the CCR and do business with the federal 
government, all entities must have a DUNS number. Te Dun and 
Bradstreet Universal Numbering System (DUNS) provides unique 
numbers to corporations and other business entities upon request. 
A business may request a DUNS number at no cost by calling Dun 
and Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505. Additional information about

Te Federal Contractor Program requires that any non-exempt 
contractor receiving a contract from the federal government in 
the amount of $25,000 or more, or any subcontractor receiving a 
contract in the amount of $25,000 or more from such a covered 
contractor, must ﬁle a VETS-100 Report on an annual basis.24 
In addition, all federal contractors or subcontractors are required 
to take airmative action to hire and promote qualiﬁed special 
disabled veterans, Vietnam-era veterans, and any veterans who 
served on active duty during a war or in a campaign or expedition 
for which a campaign badge has been authorized.

R Take advantage of training & certiﬁcation 
opportunities. 
Many colleges, universities, professional and trade associations, 
and government agencies oﬀer training and continuing education 
programs in workshop settings or online. Oﬀerings will vary from 
state to state, but common topics are best management practices, 
OSHA and worker safety, working with private landowners, 
business management, marketing, and quality control. Some 
organizations oﬀer “master logger,” “certiﬁed wildlife biologist,” 
“accredited logging professional,” “wilderness ﬁrst aid and CPR 
practitioner,” “prescribed burn manager,” and other relevant 
certiﬁcations.
R Collect references and take photographs. 
If you are preparing a proposal for a contract to be awarded on a 
best value basis, the Forest Service will want you to provide a list 
of business references and information about projects on which 
you have done work similar to that being advertised. “Before” and 
“after” photographs of sites on which you have worked are also 
helpful in seeking contracts for work on private forestlands.
R Identify potential subcontractors. 
If you plan to make a proposal on a project that requires the 
completion of activities for which you currently lack the in-
house capability, you will probably need to recruit and screen 
subcontractors. Look at some of their past work, check their 
references, and otherwise make sure that they are competent and 
reliable and can meet your needs.
R Do your homework. 
Before preparing a bid or proposal, always visit the project site 
and familiarize yourself with the conditions and circumstances in 
which you will be operating. Make your own estimates/cruises of 
the volume and condition of the material you will be purchasing 
and/or removing. Forest Service estimates may not be accurate. If 
you are not used to bidding work on a per-acre basis, you may want 
to seek assistance in making your cost estimates. Be particularly 
careful not to underestimate the amount of non-merchantable 
material you will be required to remove. Finally, read all the contract 
speciﬁcations, even those that are incorporated by reference. 
Particularly note the equipment and material speciﬁcations.
R Have a good quality control program in place. 
Adopting a system that focuses on eliminating errors up-front, 
rather than correcting them afterwards, will save time and money 
and make you more competitive.

types “approved for use in stewardship contracting”: two integrated 
resource timber contracts, two integrated resource service contracts, 
and a service contract. Because some agency oficials interpret 
that direction to mean that delivered log contracting—a desirable 
implementation tool—can no longer be used, further clariication is 
being sought.
