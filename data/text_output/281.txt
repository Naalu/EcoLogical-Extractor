ABSTRACT 
Disturbance plays an important ecological role in 
determining the structure and species composition of 
grassland communities. Xeric limestone prairies, a rare 
and threatened habitat in Pennsylvania, are currently 
being invaded by woody species, such as Juniperus vir­
giniana (Eastern red-cedar), Elaeagnus umbellata 
(autumn olive), Lonicera spp, (honeysuckles), and 
Crataegus spp. (hawthorns). Woody plant invasion 
threatens the long-term persistence of the 10 known re­
maining limestone prairies in Pennsylvania. Repeat 
aerial photographs were rectified in a Geographical In­
formation System and were used to calculate rates of 
woody plant invasion within two limestone prairies in 
central Pennsylvania. The average invasion rate from 
1949 to 1994 was 1,350 m2/year in the Great Plains 
prairie and 325 m2/year in the Westfall Ridge Prairie 
Preserve (The Nature Conservancy). Extremely 
droughty soils are a major impediment to rapid woody 
invasion and are the sole contributors to prairie main­
tenance at present. Historically, however, Indian-set 
fires and other anthropogenic disturbances promoted 
establishment and maintenance of xeric limestone 
prairies. Agricultural activities, such as plowing and 
livestock grazing (and associated soil erosion), forest 
clearing, and quarrying activities may have opened up 
areas for colonization by prairie species. This study 
highlights the importance of exogenous disturbances in 
determining xeric limestone prairie structure and 
species composition and suggests management strate­
gies for restoring and maintaining the threatened 
prairies of Pennsylvania.

INTRODUCTION 
Ecological disturbances are ubiquitous in nature and 
are important for virtually every ecosystem that has 
been studied (White 1979, Vogi 1980, Bazzaz 1983, 
Sousa 1984, Pickett and White 1985). Many forms of 
disturbances influence the landscape at different tem­
poral and spatial scales (Denslow 1985, Romme et a1. 
1998). Sousa (1984) differentiated physical distur­
bances, such as floods, fires and wind, from biological 
disturbances, such as grazing and predation. Romme et 
a1. (1998) discussed the differences between large, in­
frequent disturbances, such as tornados, hurricanes and 
crown-fires, from small, frequent disturbances, such as 
windthrows and low-intensity fires. Denslow (1985) 
highlighted differences between "natural" disturbances 
(e.g., floods) and "exotic" disturbances (e.g., human ac­
tivities such as clearcuts and swidden agriculture). 
Bradshaw and Marquet (2003) reviewed the powerful 
influence of human disturbance in the Americas, and 
Russell (1997) demonstrated that species and commu­
nity distributions are largely determined by past human 
land use. "Natural"disturbances have increasingly been 
viewed as important processes in many ecosystems, but 
anthropogenic disturbances are generally thought of as 
negative and erosive to ecological integrity (see Mooney 
and Godron 1983). Anthropogenic disturbances are 
typically associated with exploitative endeavors, such as 
timber harvesting and strip mining. Though these types 
of activities are surely devastating to forested land­
scapes, other anthropogenic activities such as pre­
scribed burning, forest clearing and livestock grazing 
can be beneficial for certain habitats, especially grass­
lands. 
Disturbance in grasslands can take many forms. Two 
broadly defined categories of disturbance in grasslands 
are 1) changes in soil conditions, and 2) defoliation 
regimes (van Andel et a1. 1987). The former includes 
altered nutrient, water, and soil availability, and the 
latter includes altered frequencies of defoliation by 
grazing, cutting, or burning. Both forms of disturbance

influence community structure III the xeric limestone 
prairies of Pennsylvania. 
Xeric limestone prairies are a rare and threatened 
habitat in the northeastern United States (Laughlin and 
Uhl, in press). They have been documented in the Mis­
souri Ozarks (Steyermark 1940, Kucera and Martin 
1957, Baskin et al. 1994, Baskin and Baskin 2000), Indi­
ana (Bacone et al. 1983), Illinois (Kurz 1981), Virginia, 
Tennessee, Georgia (DeSelm 1993), Alabama (Harper 
1920, DeSelm 1993), Ohio (Braun 1928), West Virginia 
(Bartgis 1993), and recently in Pennsylvania (Laughlin 
and Uhl, in press). Proper management of these unique 
natural areas hinges on an adequate understanding of 
the ecological processes required to maintain prairie 
structure and species diversity. 
Woody plant encroachment, often by Juniperus vir­
giniana (eastern red-cedar), bas been identified as the 
most important threat to limestone prairie persistence 
throughout the East and Midwest (Harper 1920, Beil­
mann and Brenner 1951, Kimmel and Probasco 1981, 
Guyette and McGinnes 1982, Annala et al. 1983, An­
nala and Kaputska 1983, DeSelm 1989, Lowell and As­
troth 1989, Bartgis 1993, DeSelm 1994, Ware 2002, 
Laughlin and Uhl, in press). Dry and shallow edaphic 
conditions are believed to inhibit woody plant recruit­
ment in xeric limestone prairies (Kucera and Martin 
1957, DeSelm et al. 1969, Annala et al. 1983, Ware 
2002). Indeed, without the extremely dry, rocky lime­
stone soils present in the limestone prairies of Ohio, 
West Virginia, and Pennsylvania (Braun 1928, Bartgis 
1993, Laughlin and Uhl, in press), these few remnant 
prairies would likely have succeeded to forest. How­
ever, xeric limestone prairie structure is also believed 
to be maintained by anthropogenic disturbances, such 
as Indian-set fires, forest clearing, and soil erosion as­
sociated with agricultural activities (Baskin et al. 1994, 
. Baskin and Baskin 2000, J.M. Baskin and c.e. Baskin, 
pers. cornm.), Since woody plants have always en­
croached into limestone prairies, it is apparent that en­
dogenous factors, such as edaphic conditions, cannot 
be the only driving processes in these small prairie sys­
tems. 
The objective of this study was to quantify the rate of 
woody plant invasion within two xeric limestone prairies 
in Pennsylvania by utilizing repeat aerial photographs 
and a Geographical Information System (GIS). The rate 
of woody plant invasion is a function of the magnitude 
and frequency of disturbance to the vegetation (Sousa 
1984). Therefore, I discuss the interactions between 
woody plant invasion and several forms of anthro­
pogenic disturbances in xeric limestone prairies in 
Pennsylvania. A secondary objective was to conduct 
floristic inventories of the Great Plains and Westfall 
Ridge prairies to determine current plant species as­
semblages and to calculate what percentage of the flora 
was exotic; 
STUDY AREA 
Xeric limestone prairies in Pennsylvania are found 
exclusively in the central counties within the Ridge and 
Valley Physiographic Province (Figure 1). Historical ac­
counts describe presettlement grasslands in the valleys 
of central Pennsylvania. In 1775, Philip Vickers Fithian

wrote, " In [Penns Valley] there are large open plains, 
cleared either by Indians or accidental fire. Hundreds 
of acres are covered with fine grass and a great variety 
of flowers" (Albion and Dodson 1934). In 1794, an "un­
known Englishman" wrote, "Soon after we had crossed 
pens Creek, we came into some land with no timber for 
several miles called potters plains pretty fowrish (sic) 
good land but much wanting of watter" (Miller 1996). 
The 10 known remnant prairies are found in the lime­
stone valleys on south-southwest facing slopes (Table 
1) and some are found near limestone ledges [see also 
Table 2 in Baskin et al. (1994)], which are indicative of 
the dry and exposed environment. Limestone prairies 
throughout the East and Midwest are often on steep to 
gently sloping hillsides with south-southwest aspects 
(Annala and Kaputska 1983, Bacone et al. 1983, De­
Selm 1989, Lowell and Astroth 1989, Bartgis 1993, 
Baskin et al. 1994, Ware 2002). All the Pennsylvania 
prairies are small « 0.2 ha), and most are found on the 
Opequon soil series (Laughlin and Uhl, in press). The 
Opequon soil series is characterized by shallow, rocky, 
clay loams underlain by limestone bedrock, which is of­
ten exposed at the surface (Braker 1981). Soils data for 
individual prairies can be found in Laughlin and Uhl 
(in press). Limestone prairies throughout the East and 
Midwest are. characterized by shallow soils (DeSelm et 
al. 1969, DeSelm 1989, 1993, Baskin et al. 1994), which 
can have mean depths as low as 3.9 em (Bartgis 1993) 
and 12.2 em (Kucera and Martin 1957). 
Bouteloua cunipendula, which is listed as threatened 
in Pennsylvania, is the dominant graminoid in xeric 
limestone prairies in Pennsylvania and West Virginia 
(Bartgis 1993, Laughlin and Uhl, in press). The most 
common native forbs in the prairies include Anemone 
oirginiana, Solidago nemoralis, Monarda fistulosa, Lithos­
permum canescens, Asclepias tuberosa, A. verticillata, A . 
oiridiflora, and Penstemon hirsutus (nomenclature fol­
lows Rhoads and Block [2000]). The most common na­
tive woody species surrounding these prairies are Ju­
niperus oirginiana, Juglans nigra, Celtis occidentalis, Pinus 
strobus, and P. ouginiana. Eleven other rare, state-listed 
species occur on limestone prairies throughout central 
Pennsylvania, including Anemone cylindrica, Bromus 
kalmii, Unum sulcatum, Lithospermum cariescens, Onos­
modium molle var. hispidissimum, Ophioglossum engel­
mannii, Panicum oligosanthes, Ranunculus fascicularis, 
Ruellia humulis, Senna marilandica, and Solidago rigida 
(Laughlin and Uhl, in press). 
Two limestone prairies were chosen for this study 
based on their historical significance and conservation 
priority. One of the remnants chosen was the Great 
Plains prairie in Penn's Valley, Centre County, Penn­
sylvania (UTM Zone 18, 279562 E, 4524674 N) since it 
is part of a limestone prairie that was extensive in pre­
settlement times (Losensky 1961, Macneal 1998, 
Ruffner and Arabas 2000, Laughlin and Uhl, in press). 
The majority of the remnant was in a forest opening on 
a gentle (14% slope) south-southwest (195°) facing slope 
(Table 1). The other remnant chosen was The Nature 
Conservancy's Westfall Ridge Prairie Preserve in Juni­
ata County, Pennsylvania (UTM Zone 18, 309168 E, 
4498828 N) since it is the only actively managed lime­
stone prairie preserve in Pennsylvania (G. Gress, The 
Nature Conservancy of Pennsylvania, pers . comm .), 
This prairie preserve is on a fairly steep (31% slope) 
south-southwest facing (210°) hillside (Table 1). 
METHODS 
I obtained six aerial photographs of each praine 
remnant, one from every decade from the 1940s to the

JOURNAL OF THE PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE Vol. 78: Number 1, 2004 
An index of moisture availability (IND), developed 
by Pallardy (1995; cited in Batek et al. 1999), was calcu­
lated for each of the 10 known limestone prairies in 
Pennsylvania based on percent slope and aspect in de­
grees. The equation used was 
IND = [cosine (aspect-45) xslope category]. 
The following slope categories were used: O( < 1%), 1 
(1-2.15%),2 (2.16-4.64%), 3 (4.65-10%),4 ( > 
10%). Therefore, the index ranges from - 4 (very xeric) 
to +4 (very mesic). This index gives a general impres­
sion of the dryness of the prairies based only on slope 
and aspect. 
Evidence of anthropogenic disturbance was sought 
for at each of the 10 prairies. Grazing and plowing his­
tories were assessed by looking at current use of adja­
cent land and by speaking with local residents. Nearby 
quarrying activities and the presence of a powerline 
right-of-way were also noted. 
Floristic inventories of the Great Plains and Westfall 
Ridge prairie were conducted in 2001. Both sites were 
visited at least three times (late spring, mid-summer, 
and fall). Every species within and immediately sur­
rounding the prairies were included in the inventory. 
The lists from the current survey were compared with 
lists compiled by botanists from the Pennsylvania Natu­
ral Diversity Inventory (PNDI) (Wiegman 1986, Smith 
1987, Kunsman 1990). 
RESULTS 
The areal extent of the limestone prairie remnants 
has declined considerably since the 1940s due to rapid 
invasion by woody plants. The Great Plains prairie 
remnant had declined from 77,824 m2 in 1949 to 17,057 
m2 in 1994 (Figure 2) at a rate of approximately 1,350 
2/year
m
(Figure 3). In 2001, the remnant was even 
smaller because of continued invasion since 1994 
(Laughlin, D.C., pers. obs.), The most common woody 
plants that have invaded the Great Plains prairie were 
Elaeagnus umbellata, Lonicera morrowii, Lonicera 
mackii, Crateagus spp., Comus racemosa, and Pinus 
strobus (Table 2). Juniperus oirginiana was not a domi­
nant member of the woody flora surrounding the Great 
Plains prairie. The average rate of invasion was roughly 
constant from 1949 to 1989 at 1,226 m 2/year, but it in­
creased drastically between 1989 and 1994 to 2,347 
m2/year, nearly double the previous rate. 
The Westfall Ridge prairie declined from 15,931 m2 
in 1949 to 1,294 m2 in 1994 (Figure 4), a rate of ap­
proximately 325 m2/year (Figure 3). The most common 
woody plants that invaded the Westfall Ridge prairie 
were Junip erus oirginiana, Lonicera spp., Quercus spp ., 
and Pinus spp. (Table 2). The average rate of en­
croachment was roughly constant from 1949 to 1970 at 
534 m2/year, but it decreased drastically between 1970

This slowed pace of en­
croachment contrasts with the increased rate that oc­
curred in the Great Plains prairie. 
All the prairies except one had highly negative in­
dices of moisture availability (Table 1). The mean IND 
was - 3.1 across all Pennsylvania limestone prairies. 
The moisture availability index was - 3.5 (very xeric) 
for the Great Plains prairie and - 3.9 (very xeric) for 
the Westfall Ridge prairie. 
Several types of anthropogenic disturbance and man­
agement influences were identified in the 10 xeric 
limestone prairies of Pennsylvania (Table 1). First, 
though not detected directly at the sites, fire suppres­
sion has been a strongly enforced policy since the be­
ginning of the 20th century throughout all of Pennsyl­
vania (Abrams and Nowacki 1992). Second, agricultural 
activities, such as plowing and livestock grazing, were 
common disturbances surrounding seven limestone 
prairies. Third, limestone quarries were present very 
near five limestone prairies. Fourth, forest clearing by 
utility providers for powerline right-of-ways occurred 
within four limestone prairies. 
A total of 99 species was detected in the Great Plains 
prairie remnant (Table 2), 25 of which were exotic 
(25%). Eleven species identified by PNDI botanists 
were not detected in the present survey, including Aster 
ericoides, Trichostema brachia tum, Andropogon gerardii; 
Schizachyrium scoparium, Sporobolus asper, and Elymus 
trachycaulus. A total of 78 species was detected in the 
Westfall Ridge prairie, 22 of which were exotic (28%). 
Four species identified by PNDI botanists were not de­
tected in the present survey, including Calystegia spi­
thamaea, Desmodium rotundifolium, and Scuttelaria el­
liptica.

DISCUSSION 
Woody plant invasion 
Both limestone prairies in this study experienced in­
vasion by woody species from 1949 to 1994 (Figure 3), 
and recent field work in 2001 confirmed that woody 
plants have continued to invade since 1994. Other stud­
ies using repeat aerial photographs have demonstrated 
areal decline in size of limestone prairies due to woody 
plant invasion in southern Ohio (Annala et al. 1983, 
Annala and Kaputska 1983), Indiana (Aldrich et al. 
1982, Bacone et al. 1983), and the Missouri Ozarks 
(Kimmel and Probasco 1980, Lowell and Astroth 1989, 
Ver Hoef et al. 1993). This study confirms that woody 
plant encroachment is a serious problem for xeric lime­
stone prairies in Pennsylvania as well. 
The increased rate of woody plant encroachment in 
the late 1980s in the Great Plains prairie likely was 
caused by a change in land use. The landownership 
shifted over 20 years ago, and the previous owner 
grazed cattle on the site, which may have suppressed 
some woody plant growth (Ritchie et al. 1998). The in­
vasion rate increased when the current owner stopped 
grazing the land. If the average trend continues, the 
Great Plains prairie could be converted to shrub fields 
or woodland by the year 2007. However, complete 
eradication of the small prairie community is unlikely 
since the rocky Opequon soils (Braker 1981) will pre­
vent woody plants from establishing on the extremely 
shallow sites (Kucera and Martin 1957, Ware 2002). 
The decreased rate of woody plant invasion after 
1970 in the Westfall Ridge prairie is most likely due to 
the extremely rocky soil in the last two remaining 
patches of prairie on the site (Figure 3). Soil in the 
surrounding forest, which was prairie earlier in the 
century, appeared less rocky than in the remaining 
prairie area (Laughlin, D.C., pers. obs.). Kucera and 
Martin (957) observed that forest soil surrounding 
limestone prairies was much deeper ( > 120 ern) than 
prairie soils (mean = 12.2 em), Soils in the Westfall 
Ridge prairie belong to the Elliber and Opequon soil 
series, which are two of the most rocky, well-drained 
soils in central Pennsylvania (Lipscomb and Farley 
1981). The extremely xeric soil impedes rapid woody 
encroachment, and without prescribed fire, it may al­
low the prairies to persist indefinitely. 
The Importance ofDisturbance inXeric LimestonePrairies 
There is an interesting interaction between endoge­
nous (e.g., edaphic conditions) and exogenous (e.g., hu­
man disturbances) factors in the maintenance of xeric 
limestone prairie structure. Extreme edaphic condi­
tions preclude the complete eradication of limestone 
prairies by woody plant invasion. In Pennsylvania, 

22 
JOURNAL OF THE PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE Vol. 78: Number 1, 2004 
woody plant encroachment may cause conversion of 
limestone prairies to a more barren-like habitat 
(shrubby, open forests with grass-dominated understo­
ries; sensu Hutchison 1994), but complete conversion 
to hardwood forest is extremely unlikely. Highly xeric, 
shallow and rocky soils (Table 1) and periodic droughts 
often cause woody plant mortality via desiccation in 
limestone prairies (Bartgis 1993). Periodic droughts 
constitute one of the two major forms of disturbance in 
grasslands (van Andel et al. 1987) since they change 
the condition of xeric prairie soil from dry to extremely 
dry. In the Ozarks, soil erosion exceeds weathering of 
bedrock due primarily to the steepness of the slopes; 
this maintains droughty soil conditions for long periods 
of time (Ware 2002). However, extreme edaphic condi­
tions can only prevent woody plant invasion on the most 
shallow and rocky sites within the prairies. Although 
some limestone prairies (or portions of them) may be 
able to maintain the open grass-dominated structure 
without disturbance (see Table 2, Baskin et al. 1994), 
the majority of limestone prairies are dependent on 
disturbances (Baskin and Baskin 2000). 
Non-human disturbances, such as native ungulate 
browsing, historically could have played a role in pre­
venting woody plant encroachment in limestone 
prairies. Browsing is a form of disturbance within the 
category of defoliation regimes (van Andel et al. 1987). 
Woody species tend to respond negatively to browsing 
pressure (DeSelm 1989, Ritchie et al. 1998, van 
Langevelde et al. 2003). Elk and small populations of 
bison inhabited central Pennsylvania prior to Euro­
American settlement, but they are currently extirpated 
from their presettlement ranges (Murie 1951, Roe 1970, 
Mitchell 1982, Thomas and Toweill 1982, Belue 1996). 
Colonel Kelly described Buffalo Valley (near Lewis­
burg, Pennsylvania) as "wooded originally with large 
but scattered trees, so that the grass grew abundantly 
and furnished good pasturage for the buffalo, and that 
the animal had been from this circumstance very abun­
dant in the valley" (Allen 1876). Bison, however, are 
primarily grazers and tend to avoid eating woody plants 
(Holechek et al. 2001). The only way to positively iden­
tify the influence of browsing ungulates in limestone 
prairies is to conduct experimental research. It seems 
more likely that anthropogenic disturbances had a 
greater impact on prairie-forest dynamics than native 
ungulates. 
Several anthropogenic disturbances have influenced 
the 10 known limestone prairies in Pennsylvania (Table 
1). Anthropogenic disturbances, such as Indian-set fires, 
forest clearing, and soil erosion associated with agricul­
tural activities O.M. Baskin and c.c. Baskin, pers. 
comrn.) have been implicated in disrupting the ten­
dency toward woody encroachment in other limestone 
prairies (Baskin et al. 1994, Baskin and Baskin 2000). 
Some of these disturbances were common in central 
Pennsylvania. Not only were most of the forests in 
Pennsylvania cleared by logging interests by ca. 1900, 
but central Pennsylvania also has a rich agricultural 
heritage in the fertile limestone valleys of the Ridge 
and Valley (Cuff et al. 1989). In the following discus­
sion , I explore the likelihood of Indian-set fires as an 
anthropogenic disturbance in Pennsylvania and the 
current influence of human disturbances on limestone 
prairie structure. 
Fire 
The Great Plains in central Pennsylvania were de­
scribed as "large open plains, cleared either by Indians 
or accidental fire" (Albion and Dodson 1934). How ac­
cidental were these fires? Fire is a key disturbance 
agent in most grassland systems. Fire has been impli­
cated as a major disturbance agent in other floristically 
similar prairies, glades, and barrens in Ohio (Annala et 
al. 1983, Annala and Kaputska 1983), West Virginia 
(Bartgis 1993), southwestern Virginia, northwest Geor­
gia, northeast Alabama, East Tennessee (DeSelrn et al. 
1969, DeSelm 1989, 1990, 1993, 1994), northwest Al­
abama (Webb et al. 1997), Kentucky (McInteer 1946), 
Missouri (Beilmann and Brenner 1951, Kucera and 
Martin 1957, Kimmel and Probasco 1981, Lowell and 
Astroth 1989, Ware 2002), and Indiana (Wade and 
Menges 1987). 
Anthropogenic fire use has significant impacts on 
landscapes containing prairies and barrens (Guyette et 
"al, 2002, 2003). Fire histories recorded in fire scars have 
consistently demonstrated that fires were most fre­
quent during Native American occupation (Guyette and 
McGinnes 1982, Guyette and Cutter 1991, Cutter and 
Guyette 1994) and that fires were much less common 
during the past century (Robertson and Heikens 1994). 
Batek et al. (1999) determined that anthropogenic fire 
regimes played an important role in the development 
of vegetation mosaics in the Ozarks, a region where 
xeric limestone prairies are common (Baskin and 
Baskin 2000). Presettlement fire intervals were deter­
mined to be 3.2 years in a limestone prairie in the 
Ozarks (Guyette and McGinnes 1982), 4.3 years in the 
Caney Mountain Wildlife Refuge in the Ozarks 
(Guyette and Cutter 1991), and 2.8 years on an oak­
hickory ridgetop in the Ozarks (Cutter and Guyette 
1994). Fire frequencies decreased when Native Ameri­
cansleft the region and increased again upon arrival of 
the settlers. Similar fire histories are likely in other oak 
forests (Abrams 1992). Fire histories have not been de­
termined in eastern limestone prairies, but fire scarred 
trees have been noted in West Virginia limestone 
prairies and barrens (Bartgis 1993), and several charred 
tree stumps were seen in Ohio limestone prairies (An­
nala and Kaputska 1983). Fire likely played a role in 
maintaining the open, perennial grass-dominated struc­

23

tureof limestone prairies in Pennsylvania as well. The 
build up of fine fuels and the xeric quality of the site 
together create an environment that is prone to burn­
ing (Pyne et a1. 1996). 
The.historic fire frequencies for central Pennsylvania 
are largely unknown because evidence of fire rapidly 
disappears in the humid climate and undisturbed natu­
ral lake sediments are difficult to locate for pollen and 
charcoal analyses. Historical evidence of fire in the 
Northeastern United States is controversial, and Rus­
sell (1983) proposed that Indian-set fires were re­
stricted to areas immediately surrounding Indian set­
tlements. Although direct evidence of fire in Pennsyl­
vania is not abundant, accumulated ecological evidence 
suggests that fire played a key role in Pennsylvania oak 
forests (Bromley 1935, Day 1953, Buell et a1. 1954, 
Marquis 1975, Lorimer 1985, Whitney 1990, Abrams 
1992, Abrams and Nowacki 1992, Ruffner and Abrams 
2002). 
Lightning-set fires are limited in Pennsylvania 
(Haines et a1. 1978). Only 2% of the fires in Pennsylva­
nia are ignited by lightning according to Pyne (1982). 
This is not because lightning is infrequent, but because 
actual ignitions tend to be extinguished by the accom­
panying precipitation during thunderstorms (Ruffner 
and Abrams 1998). However, "eyewitness accounts and 
charcoal studies suggest that Indians were responsible 
for increasing fire frequency above the low numbers 
that would have been caused by lightning" in Pennsyl­
vania (Abrams 1992). This was also the case in the 
Ozarkian highlands (Guyette et a1. 2002). Other non­
human ignition sources in Pennsylvania include char­
coaling in the iron industry and sparks from railroads 
(Haines et a1. 1978). An old railroad bed is within 50 m 
of the Great Plains remnant. Sparks from trains may 
have ignited fires (Haines et a1. 1978) within the his- . 
toric Great Plains area, but these ignitions were likely 
localized and infrequent. 
Native Americans burned their woodlands for a 
number of reasons, mostly those related to hunting 
practices (Van der Donck 1841 cited in Russell 1983). 
Burning the forest understory kept it free from dense 
brush, dried plant material, and dead branches. This 
made traveling easier and quieter for the hunter. Some 
tribes burned their forests to stimulate berry produc­
tion (Vora 1993). The Delaware Indians were promi­
nent in Pennsylvania prior to European settlement, and 
they were reported to have set fires in large circles to 
trap all the game within the enclosing ring of flame 
(Lindestrorn 1925). Indian-set fires were reported in 
Franklin County (the location of Baker Caverns prairie 
[Figure 1]), where "the woods and grass of the moun­
tains and prairies were burned and their game was 
driven from concealment" (Richard ]887 cited in Klotz 
and Walck 1993). Frequent disturbances, interpreted to 
represent native burning cycles, were also characteris­
tic of an Iroquoian forest settlement in northwestern 
Pennsylvania (Ruffner and Abrams 2002). 
Relying solely on historical documents, Russell (1983) 
claims that most Indian-set fires were restricted to sites 
of Indian habitation. However, the limestone prairies 
documented in this study were not located near his­
toric Indian settlements (Wallace 1965, Sluyter, A, The 
Pennsylvania State University, pers. cornm.). Instead, 
they were located near Indian trails (Wallace 1965). The 
Great Plains prairie remnant in Penns Valley, Centre 
County, lies very near a famous Indian trail crossroad 
known as The Forks (Macneal 1998, Laughlin 2002); 
the Westfall Ridge prairie and other nearby prairies in 
Juniata County are very close to the Tuscarora Path; 
the Georgetown Road passed through Williamson, 
Pennsylvania, which is close to Baker Caverns prairie; 
and Penns Creek Path crossed through the historic 
"plains" of Centre County (Wallace]965). If historical 
Indian-set fires did maintain xeric limestone prairies 
and oak woodlands, then Indian-set fires were not 
merely restricted to Indian settlements; they also were 
common along trails. 
Regardless of who or what ignited the fires, wildfires 
have been heavily suppressed in Pennsylvania since the 
early 1900's (Haines et a1. 1978). According to data 
compiled by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry, 
Abrams and Nowacki (1992) calculated that "the 
amount of area burned per year and the average fire 
size in all of Pennsylvania decreased by 99% and 98%, 
respectively, between 1908 and 1989," and "it is proba­
ble that early fire records were incomplete and under­
estimated by 50% or more." Consequently, it is likely 
that limestone prairies in Pennsylvania have not burned 
for over a century (Table 1). 
Other Anthropogenic Disturbances 
Historically, human-set fires may have maintained 
the grass-dominated structure of limestone prairies, but 
more recent anthropogenic disturbances have signifi­
cantly influenced the limestone prairies in Pennsylva­
nia (Table 1). Agricultural activities, forest clearing by 
logging industries and utility providers, and quarrying 
activities opened up areas for colonization by prairie 
species. 
Agricultural activities,such as plowing and grazing, 
are very common endeavors in the valleys of central 
Pennsylvania (Cuff et a1. 1989). Aerial photographs 
show that both prairies in this study were very near 
crop fields (Figures 2 and 4). Settlement agriculture 
(late-1700s to mid-1800s) was the first threat to the 
limestone prairies of Pennsylvania. The historical 
boundary of the Great Plains, elucidated by Losensky 
(1961) and Macneal (1998), indicates that the prairie 
persisted on areas of deeper soil, which have since been 
converted to cropland. Evidence from floristic compo­

24 
JOURNAL OF THE PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE Vol. 78: Number 1, 2004 
sition suggests that a slightly more mesic component 
was present in the flora. Andropogon gerardii and 
Sorghastrum nutans were detected by Kunsman (1990), 
but only a couple individuals of Sorghastrum were found 
recently, and Andropogon was not seen at all. Mesic 
prairie species once may have been more important in 
areas within the Great Plains where soils were deeper. 
Fortunately, not everything was plowed under. I do 
not believe that the prairie remnants in this study were 
ever tilled because the soils are too shallow (see Harper 
1920). However, soil erosion associated with livestock 
grazing may have played a role in removing soil from 
the upper surface layers, thereby creating more xeric 
conditions in the soil, which are best exploited by xeric 
prairie species. Grazing pressure may have also played 
a role in maintaining limestone prairies. Livestock 
grazed in the Great Plains prairie for many decades 
(Table n. As suggested above, removal of grazing pres­
sure after 1970 may be responsible for the increased 
rate of woody plant invasion in the Great Plains prairie. 
Grazing was likely a factor in maintaining other lime­
stone prairies (Table 1; see also DeSelm 1993), though 
detailed grazing histories for the study areas were not 
compiled in this study. 
Limestone quarries were found near five limestone 
prairies (Table 1). In fact, a limestone quarry can be 
seen appearing in the 1950s aerial photograph immedi­
ately east of the current Westfall Ridge Prairie Pre­
serve (Figure 4). Whether or how the quarrying activi­
ties actually influenced the vegetation is uncertain. 
Quarries may exist only near the prairies because the 
limestone bedrock is so near the surface. However, it 
appears that historical limestone quarrying may be re­
sponsible for creation of a limestone prairie in Canoe 
Creek State Park, Pennsylvania, since many limestone 
prairie species thrive on the exposed bedrock (Kuns­
man 1988). DeSelm (1993) noted that three "barrens 
and glades" in the southern Ridge and Valley were 
found near limestone quarries. Currently, however, 
quarries are undoubtedly more of a threat than a posi­
tive influence to the rare limestone prairies. Limestone 
quarries threaten limestone prairies in West Virginia 
(Bartgis 1985) and one quarry destroyed a species rich 
prairie/barren complex on Knobly Mountain, West 
Virginia in 1991 (Bartgis 1993). 
Forest was cleared for powerline right-of-ways 
(ROW) on four limestone prairies in Pennsylvania (Ta­
ble 1). In no case is the prairie vegetation strictly lim­
ited to the cleared path for the powerline. However, 
clearing woody vegetation to maintain the ROWs is ap­
parently beneficial for the prairie species that thrive in 
high light conditions. These are examples of the posi­
tive role that forest clearing can play for the persis­
tence of rare non-forest species. DeSelm (1989, 1993) 
noted that barrens in Tennessee were found often along 
mown roadsides or under powerline ROWs maintained 
by bush hogging. Mowing, or some other mode of woody 
plant removal, will be necessary to maintain open 
prairies (Baskin, ee, pel's. comrn.). For example, in 
the Westfall Ridge Prairie, The Nature Conservancy 
felled several Juniperus virginiana trees and removed 
them from the site by hand (the eastern red-cedars can 
be seen in Figure 4 in the middle of the largest rem­
nant, but they are no longer in the preserve). 
Management Implications 
Aerial photographs demonstrate how quickly these 
prairies have been and are being replaced by woody 
species. Although some xeric limestone prairies may be 
able to maintain their grass-dominated structure due to 
the highly xeric nature of the soils, most limestone 
prairies will be converted to barrens (sensu Hutchison 
1994) or woodlands without the periodic disturbances 
that impede the encroaching woody flora (Bartgis 1993, 
Baskin and Baskin 2000). Soil conditions may slow the 
rate of woody plant invasion (DeSelm 1994), but if these 
limestone prairies are not managed, they and their as­
sociated rare plant species will be in danger of extirpa­
tion in Pennsylvania. 
It is now widely accepted that conservation and 
restoration decisions "must consider the role of distur­
bance" (Pickett and White 1985) in order to be success­
ful. One of the central questions in limestone prairie 
disturbance ecology is how often must prairies be dis­
turbed for optimal maintenance? Frequent fire regimes 
near limestone prairies in the Ozarks suggest that his­
torical fire frequencies could also be high for other 
limestone prairies in North America. However, fire his­
tories have not been determined for limestone prairies 
in the Eastern United States. Baskin et al. (1994) stated 
that xeric limestone prairies must be "occasionally" dis­
turbed. Wade and Menges (1987) concluded that burn­
ing was important in limestone prairies in Indiana but 
the optimal frequency of burns was not known. Not only 
is the frequency of disturbance unknown, but the in­
tensity of disturbance also is not well understood. De­
Selm (1989) concluded that very intense disturbances 
(i.e., intense grazing history and frequent mowing) de­
creased species richness. Therefore, if fire or other 
management techniques are used too often they may 
negatively impact plant diversity. Land managers in 
Pennsylvania would greatly benefit from quantitative 
dendrochronological studies to determine historical 
frequency of fires near limestone prairies so that "opti­
mal" disturbance frequencies can be accurately emu­
lated . 
Management practices for limestone prairies in 
Pennsylvania will be similar to restoration techniques 
in the tallgrass prairies. Mechanical thinning of trees 
and shrubs accompanied by prescribed burns likely will 
maintain the integrity of these prairies into the future.

BIOLOGY: LAUGHLIN 
Tree removal from the surrounding forest alone will 
not stimulate prairie seedling recruitment from the 
residual seed bank, so introducing native seeds or 
seedlings into the thinned areas will be necessary for 
increased success of native herbaceous plant produc­
tion (Laughlin 2003). Moreover, exotic plant removal 
may be necessary where exotics outcompete members 
of the native flora. For example, The Nature Conser­
vancy manually removes the exotic invasive Centaurea 
maculosa almost annually since it is so abundant in the 
Westfall Ridge prairie. Nearly 
quarter of the species ' 
in each prairie in this study are exotic (Table 2). Re­
moval of introduced weeds might become increasingly 
important if exotic plants negatively impact native pop­
ulations, especially populations of species listed as 
threatened in Pennsylvania. 
This study emphasizes the need for exogenous dis­
turbances and human management in xeric limestone 
prairies. Although management options in limestone 
prairies must be researched further, designing robust, 
well-replicated experiments of restoration treatments 
may be impossible in limestone prairies since they are 
too small and too few (Laughlin and Uhl, in press) for 
adequate experimentation. Regardless, implementation 
of small-scale treatments, like the thinning project con­
ducted by The Nature Conservancy, is of paramount 
importance if land managers wish to restore or main­
tain limestone prairies in Pennsylvania. Historically, 
xeric limestone prairies were maintained by anthro­
pogenic disturbances; therefore, human intervention 
will be necessary to save these prairies from woody 
plant encroachment.
