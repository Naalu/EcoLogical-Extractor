of an alarming amount of old-
growth ponderosa pines. In October
1999, 5 acres (2 ha) at the Old Folks
Home site were burned and in
March 2000,25 acres (10 ha) at
experimental block (EB) 1 were
burned. The sites were on two edges
of a large, shallow-soiled lava flow,
which historically had high-fre-
quency, low-intensity surface fire
regimes but had remained largely
fire free for 130 years. The area had
experienced severe drought in 1977,
1989, 1996, and 2000.
E very year, fire managers success-
fully restore surface fires to
ponderosa pine forests that have
not burned for a century or more.
Nevertheless, the power of fire can
have unanticipated effects on
stressed trees. In northern Arizona,
an episode of unusual old-growth
tree mortality, after two prescribed
bums on shallow volcanic soils,
provided managers with a learning
opportunity and a lesson in caution.
The unusual mortality seemed
confined to the lava flow region.
High mortality was not observed on
the adjacent thinned 650 acres (260
ha) or unthinned 396 acres (160
ha), which were burned between
1996 and 2001. However, Swezy and
Agee (1991) found high old-growth
ponderosa pine mortality following
a fire at Crater Lake, OR, in another
ponderosa forest on shallow lava
soils. They suggested that the cause
was heat injury to fine roots (fig. 3).
Other hypotheses include reduced
tree vigor, drought stress, or lack of
wind to disperse heat during the
Old Folks Home burn.
Before conducting the burns, all
old-growth trees at both sites were
protected against heat damage to
the cambium layer by raking
accumulated forest floor litter away
from the tree trunks; research has
shown that removal of deep forest
floors prevents tree girdling by fire
(Sackett and others 1996). The 1999
burn site had no tree thinning
before burning, whereas the 2000
burn site was previously thinned to
help restore the conditions that
existed before the frequent fire
regimes were disrupted (Covington
and others 1997).
A census of trees greater than 5.9
inches (15 cm) in diameter was
conducted on the site of the Old
Folks Home burn on June 5 and 6,
2001 (fig. 4). Of 247 ponderosa pine
trees, 91 (37 percent) were dead.
Five of the dead trees had great
decay, suggesting that they probably
died before the prescribed burn. Not
counting these trees, the mortality
rate was 35 percent. The pattern of
mo'ttality varied with tree size. Only
19 percent of the trees that were
less than 20 inches (50 cm) died,
compared with a 67 -percent mortal-

measurements at EBI indicated
minimal fire effects; however, field
observation in May 2001 showed
that many old trees were dying.

Ponderosa pine forests at the base
of Mt. Trumbull in the Grand
Canyon-Parashant National Monu-
ment have been the focus of exten-
sive research in ecological restora-
tion since 1995. Sponsored by the
USDI Bureau of Land Management,
Arizona Game and Fish Depart-
ment, and Northern Arizona Uni-
versity, the research gives managers
information about how to restore
natural surface fire regimes and
open forest conditions using pro-
ductive native vegetation. Since,
1995,650 acres (260 ha) have been
treated with thinning, fuel reduc-
tion, and prescribed fire. An addi-
tional396 acres (160 ha) have been
treated with fire alone.

than 20 inches (50 cm) in diameter.
A similar comparison will be done
at EBI in a few years, when the fire-
caused mortality is fully evident.

Future Trends
Conservation of the old-growth
trees that are scattered across the
landscape is an important project
goal. The Old Folks Home and EBI
sites make up less than 3 percent of
the total area burned at Mt.
Trumbull, so the death of old trees
is not widespread. However, it
might be necessary to stop burning
on the lava flow pending further
information from both experimen-
tal sites. Researchers might repeat
pre- and postburn measurements
on permanent monitoring plots and
compare them with a nearby
control site; they might also study
fine-root mortality and drought
stress on old-growth trees in the
lava area. Additionally, managers
should consider using only nonfire
treatments, such as thinning alone,
for forests on lava soils.
Fire Management Today

Unfortunately, the true extent of
tree mortality on the EBI and Old
Folks Home experimental sites
remains unknown. Several years
might pass before needles on the
remaining large ponderosa pine
trees, which appear to be alive and
well, begin prematurely to brown
and fall.
