Landscape-scale wildﬁre has occurred in higher frequencies across the planet. Fuel reduction treatments
to ﬁre-adapted systems have been shown to reduce the impact to human values-at-risk. However, few
studies have examined if these treatments contribute to ecosystem resilience, or the capacity of a system
to absorb perturbation and return to a similar set of structures or processes. We deﬁned short-term met-
rics of resiliency to test the hypothesis that fuel reduction treatments in mixed conifer forests increased a
ﬁre-adapted system’s resiliency to uncharacteristically severe wildﬁre. In addition, we tested the hypoth-
esis that fuel reduction treatments reduced burn severity, thereby increasing protection for adjacent
human communities. We examined a mixed conifer forested landscape in the southwestern U.S. that
was burned by a landscape-scale ‘‘mega-ﬁre’’ in 2011; fuel reduction treatments had been established
around communities in the 10 years prior to the ﬁre. Fire effects were highly variable in both treated
and untreated forests. However, analysis of resiliency metrics showed that: (a) treated units retained a
higher proportion of large trees and had post-ﬁre tree densities within the natural range of variability;
(b) the understory herbaceous community had signiﬁcantly higher cover of native grasses in the treated
units, but no signiﬁcant differences in nonnative cover between treated and untreated units; and (c) high-
severity patch sizes were signiﬁcantly larger in untreated stands and covered a larger proportion of the
landscape than historical reference conditions. Fire severity, as deﬁned by overstory mortality and basal
area loss, was signiﬁcantly lower in treated units; on average, trees killed per hectare in untreated units
was six times the number of trees killed in treated units. Fuel reduction treatments simultaneously
reduced ﬁre severity and enhanced short-term metrics of ecosystem resiliency to uncharacteristically
severe ﬁre.

1. Introduction
In recent decades, larger and more severe wildﬁres have
erupted with increasing frequency in ﬁre-prone systems around
the world. While ﬁre is a natural disturbance process in 46% of
the global area of major habitat types, some recent ﬁres have been
detrimental both to human communities, human-valued resources
as well as to ecological integrity (Westerling et al., 2006; Climate
Central, 2012; Attiwill and Binkley, 2013). To further challenge
resource and ﬁre management, human communities continue to
expand into ﬁre-adapted and/or ﬁre-prone systems. In the U.S.,
44 million homes are located in these Wildland Urban Interface
(WUI) environments (Radeloff et al., 2005). In the last two decades,
uncharacteristically severe ﬁre events resulted in increased loss of
structures and damaging impacts to ecosystem services and water-
sheds (Savage and Mast, 2005; Allen et al., 2011). Full cost account-
ing of these events incorporates socio-economic loss and can be
more than twice total costs that include mitigation activities, and
can be up to 15 times the wildﬁre suppression costs alone
(Combrink et al., 2013). Ecological impacts include ecosystem
and disturbance regime shifts in response to these novel distur-
bances (Folke et al., 2004; Buma et al., 2013). While studies have
assessed the effectiveness of preventive ﬁre hazard reduction
treatment in protecting society’s priority resources (Pollet and
Omi, 2002; Fulé et al., 2012; Martinson and Omi, 2013), little is
done to assess treatment effectiveness at protecting ecological val-
ues and maintaining ecosystem integrity (Ager et al., 2010;
Cochrane et al., 2012). In this study, we examined the potential

protection goals and increase ecosystem resiliency to large-scale
novel disturbances.
Ecosystem resiliency is deﬁned (sensu Holling, 1973) as the
ability of a system to absorb a perturbation or novel disturbance
and return to a similar set of structures or processes. Assessing
and measuring resiliency in natural systems is challenging (Allen
et al., 2011; Benson and Garmestani, 2011), but initially requires
stating parameters, including clearly deﬁning the ‘‘resilience of
what [variable] to what [disturbance]’’ (Carpenter et al., 2001;
Benson and Garmestani, 2011). Resiliency can be impacted by
the scale and novelty of landscape-scale disturbance events like
wildﬁre (Folke et al., 2005; Savage and Mast, 2005; Buma et al.,
2013). While ﬁre is an integral process in the evolution of vegeta-
tive communities across the globe (Meyers, 2006), recent large,
uncontrollable wildﬁres can exhibit ﬁre effects well outside the
natural range of variability for some systems, including uncharac-
teristic severity or patch size (Savage and Mast, 2005; Bowman
et al., 2009; Buma et al., 2013; Larson et al., 2013). The occurrences
of landscape-scale, high-severity wildﬁres correlate with regional
weather patterns such as increased temperatures and drought
(Seager et al., 2007); however, contributing factors in the western
U.S. also include millions of hectares of forested stands with
uncharacteristically high tree densities and fuel loads (Covington
and Moore, 1994; Hessburg et al., 2005; Everett et al., 2007; Fulé
et al., 2012). These conditions will be exacerbated by further
drought and temperature increase associated with climate change;
ﬁre modeling under conservative climate change scenarios shows
increasing probability of occurrence of these uncharacteristically
large and severe ﬁres, also called ‘‘mega-ﬁres’’ (Freid et al., 2004;
Westerling et al., 2006; Karl et al., 2009; Littell et al., 2009; Liu
et al., 2010). Detrimental ecological impacts from these novel dis-
turbances include forest plant and animal species composition
changes, hydrologic changes, increased vulnerability to invasive
plant species, disturbance regime shifts and/or ecosystem shifts
from forest to non-forest (Beisner et al., 2003; Buma et al., 2013;
Bowman et al., 2013). Continued departures from keystone
disturbances may result in less resilient systems, including forests
unable to support all associated successional stages or forests tran-
sitioning to shrub–grass systems (Beisner et al., 2003; Bowman
et al., 2013; Stephens et al., 2013).
While resiliency metrics encompass a broader perspective than
strict restoration, the key to resiliency thinking is to integrate mul-
tiple ecological variables to identify ecosystem thresholds, adap-
tive cycles and potential regime shifts (Carpenter et al., 2001;
Benson and Garmestani, 2011; Rist and Moen, 2013). In this
respect, historic reference conditions from time periods with intact
ecosystem structures and disturbance processes can be used to
develop resiliency benchmarks. Forests that evolved with low-
severity, frequent-ﬁre that today are susceptible to high-severity
ﬁres, can cross thresholds to novel systems, and therefore lack
resilience.
In the western U.S., mixed conifer forests encompass a diverse
assemblage of ﬁre-adapted pine and ﬁr and sometimes hardwood
species (Agee, 1993). Historic ﬁre regimes in mixed conifer forest
historically changed along an elevational gradient, with frequent
surface ﬁres often found at lower elevations and south-facing
aspects
(warm/dry
mixed
conifer),
and
infrequent,
stand-
replacing ﬁres found at higher elevations and north-facing, more
mesic aspects (cool/moist mixed conifer) (Fulé et al., 2003;
Hessburg et al., 2005; Margolis and Balmat, 2009; Romme et al.,
2009).
Warm/dry
forests
were
historically
less
dense
and
were dominated by ﬁre-resistant tree species compared to cool/
moist forests. Today, warm/dry mixed conifer forests are denser
than they
were historically
and
include more
ﬁre-sensitive
species due to ﬁre exclusion (Evans et al., 2011; Margolis et al.,
2013).
In the U.S., efforts to mitigate the effects of large, severe wild-
ﬁres do not focus on ecological or resiliency goals, but include
prioritized funding for hazardous fuel reduction treatments on fed-
eral, state and private lands to protect communities and other
human values (US Congress, 2003). The priority locations for these
fuel treatments focus on the WUI, where relatively small treatment
units are concentrated around towns and dispersed settlements
(Ager et al., 2010). The 2011 ﬁre season in the southwestern U.S.
produced some of the largest and most severe wildﬁres on record.
Arizona’s largest wildﬁre to date, the Wallow Fire, was a human-
caused ﬁre ignited May 29, 2011. By early July, the Wallow Fire
had burned across 217,741 ha of forest and montane grasslands
in eastern Arizona and western New Mexico, with ﬁre managers
reporting unusually extreme ﬁre behavior including crowning
patch sizes as large as 10,000 ha and spotting distances greater
than 5 km (Wadleigh, 2011). This ﬁre burned primarily on the
Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests (ASNF), also known for the ﬁrst
10-year stewardship contract on federal land awarded in 2004
under the then-pilot Stewardship Contracting Authority. The
objectives of the White Mountain Stewardship Project (WMSP)
were to thin forests to reduce wildﬁre risk to local communities
and grow local industry to process the large amounts of small
diameter wood removed through thinning efforts (USFS White
Mountain Stewardship, 2013). Restoration and increasing resil-
iency of the ecosystem were secondary goals.
Forest fuel reduction treatments and the Wallow Fire occurred
in a mix of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and mixed conifer for-
est types. Both fuel reduction and restoration objectives in mixed
conifer forests can be met by thinning out small diameter
ﬁre-intolerant species (removing ladder fuels) and shifting forest
structure and composition to larger-diameter, ﬁre-resistant trees
(Evans et al., 2011), moving systems toward historic reference con-
ditions Reintroducing ﬁre consumes accumulated surface fuel and
contributes signiﬁcantly to nutrient cycling, vegetation composi-
tion, and quality wildlife habitat while also increasing resiliency
to wildﬁre (Franklin et al., 2008; North et al., 2009; Evans et al.,
2011). Several empirical studies and systematic reviews have
shown fuel reduction treatments reduce wildﬁre severity (Fulé
et al., 2012; Stephens et al., 2012; Martinson and Omi, 2013). We
hypothesize fuel reduction treatments not only reduce ﬁre burn
severity, but increase ecosystem resiliency to landscape-scale,
high-severity ﬁre, and that post-ﬁre systems remain similar or
move closer toward the structure and composition conditions
found under intact disturbances and climate regimes (i.e., historic
reference conditions).
We tested the hypotheses that wildﬁre hazard reduction treat-
ments increase ecological resiliency to uncharacteristically severe
ﬁre and that fuel reduction treatments reduce wildﬁre severity in
treated compared with untreated stands. Our speciﬁc questions
were: (1) Do mixed conifer forests with fuel reduction treatments
show higher resiliency than those without treatment as measured
by the following three metrics: (a) tree survivorship, especially
large mature trees; (b) nonnative/native herbaceous understory
cover ratio; and (c) high severity patch size?; and (2) Are fuel
reduction treatments effective in mitigating burn severity under
severe wildﬁre conditions?
2. Methods
2.1. Study area
Study sites were located on the Apache-Sitgreaves NF, near the
eastern Arizona communities of Greer, Alpine and Nutrioso and
where
multiple
WUI-associated
fuel
reduction
treatments
occurred (Fig. 1). These sites were on the northern extent of the
44

Wallow Fire and burned between June 4 and June 9, 2011. Our
study sites were in warm/dry mixed conifer ecosystems with ele-
vations ranging from 2469 to 2838 m. Sites were identiﬁed using
Terrestrial Ecosystem Units (TES) and then conﬁrmed in the ﬁeld
by
the
following
criteria:
codominance
of
ponderosa
pine,
Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga mensiesii) and Gambel oak (Quercus gam-
belii) (Romme et al., 2009). Forest composition in all size classes
included ponderosa pine, white-ﬁr (Abies concolor), Douglas-ﬁr
and dispersed patches of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and
Gambel oak. On the days our sites burned, the ﬁre made consider-
able runs, consuming 16,250–30,850 ha daily (Inciweb, 2012). The
closest Remote Automated Weather Station (Alpine and Greer;
Western Regional Climate Center, www.wrcc.dri.edu; accessed 8
March 2013) recorded maximum temperatures between 23.3 and
25.0 C, minimum relative humidity of 6–15%, 1000-h fuel mois-
ture of 5.7–6.9%, and maximum wind speeds of 38.5–67.7 km h1
out of the southwest. Average total annual precipitation from
2001 to 2011 was 399 mm. The total annual precipitation in
2011, the year of the Wallow Fire, was close to average (90% of
the decadal average). However, the majority of the precipitation
fell with an exceptionally wet monsoon season following the
Wallow Fire; winter precipitation prior to the ﬁre only accounted
for 8% of the year’s total precipitation, yielding the second driest
winter in a decade.
2.2. Experimental design
In order to evaluate whether fuel reduction treatments demon-
strated differences in measures of resiliency, and were effective in
reducing burn severity, we utilized a quasi-experimental design
(Shadish et al., 2002) and sampled nine pairs of treated–untreated
units (Fig. 1). Treated units were selected based on the following
set of criteria: (1) warm/dry mixed conifer forest type; (2) treated
within 10 years; (3) greater than 12 ha in size; and (4) burned as a
result of the Wallow Fire. The untreated paired units were geo-
graphically near treated units (but independent of or not affected
by them), had similar topography and were within the same ﬁre
progression day (24-h period). We avoided selecting sites with
roads or other potential ﬁrebreaks between the treated and
untreated area. Treatments studied included non-commercial or
pre-commercial mechanical thinning followed by residual fuel
removal (mechanically or broadcast burned) prior to wildﬁre inci-
dent. The highest priority for fuel reduction in the last 10 years was
in the WUI, thus the treatment units coincided with areas adjacent
to communities. Treatments were identiﬁed using the U.S. Forest
Service (USFS) Activity Tracking System (FACTS) database, Google
Earth and consultation with local USFS staff. A geographic informa-
tion system (GIS) was used to overlay systematic point grids
(100  100 m) on treated and untreated site polygons. Ten points
were randomly selected at each site for the establishment of ﬁeld
sample plots (18 units  10 plots = 180 plots). To address these
questions, we avoided edge effects with a 100-m buffer between
plots and treatment perimeter.
We deﬁned ecosystem resiliency metrics for three short-term
ecosystem variables. We utilized known reference conditions
(Stoddard, 2011) for mixed-conifer overstory composition and
structure and high severity patch size as resiliency benchmarks
(Margolis et al., 2007, 2011; Roccaforte et al., 2012). We utilized
cover of nonnative and native species and overall functional group
cover to assess understory resiliency. To address the second
hypothesis, whether fuel reduction treatments reduced ﬁre sever-
ity, this study utilized both basal area (BA) loss and tree mortality
as measures of relative burn severity.
2.3. Field methods and statistical analysis
Sample plots were measured between June and August 2012,
one year after the Wallow Fire. Plot centers were permanently
marked with steel stakes, and all trees were tagged to ensure exact
relocation for potential re-sampling in subsequent years. Trees tal-
ler than breast height (137 cm) were measured on a 400-m2
(11.28-m
radius)
circular
plot.
Tree
measurements
included
species, condition (living or snag/log classes sensu Thomas et al.,
1979), diameter at breast height (dbh), and bole char height
(minimum and maximum). Fifty-meter transects were aligned per-
pendicular to the general slope of each plot and end points were
marked with pieces of steel rebar. Understory measurements were
assessed along the 50-m line transect; species richness was col-
lected in a 500-m2 (10  50-m) belt transect; cover of vascular
plants was measured in ﬁve 1-m2 (0.5  2-m) quadrats systemati-
cally located at 10-m intervals along the transect. Foliar cover by
species (%) was visually estimated and recorded for each quadrat.
Forest structure conditions prior to the Wallow Fire (2011)
were reconstructed by categorizing the observed dead trees mea-
sured in 2012. Dead trees were determined to be killed by the ﬁre
using the following characteristics: absence of green needles; pres-
ence of scorched (red) or burned (black) needles and ﬁne twigs.
Tree mortality based on these criteria is conservative; it can take
up
to
ﬁve
years
for
trees
killed
by
ﬁre
to
lose
needles.
Reconstructed pre-ﬁre forest structure (average trees per hectare
(TPH) and BA) were used to compare differences between treat-
ments by year — the reconstructed pre-ﬁre (2011) and the post-ﬁre
(2012) — with a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests were also used to quantify forest structure
changes over time (pre-ﬁre to post-ﬁre) within treatment. Canopy
bulk density was estimated using equations found in Cruz et al.
(2003) and analyzed with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Differences
in pre- and post-ﬁre tree composition were analyzed using a per-
mutational multivariate analysis (PERMANOVA, Anderson, 2001)
with Bray–Curtis dissimilarity distance measure (Faith et al.,
1987). Differences in composition were tested in terms of basal
area and trees ha1 (PC-ORD software version 5.10, McCune and
Mefford,
2006).
Understory
richness
and
cover
were
not
reconstructed and were compared between treatments post-ﬁre
(2012) using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

To assess patch size differences among treated and untreated
stands, we used the remotely sensed Rapid Assessment of
Vegetation condition after wildﬁre (RAVG, 2011) layer in ARCGIS
to identify high severity patches, deﬁned by the RAVG as pixels
with 75–100% BA loss (RAVG, 2011; Miller and Thode, 2007). We
used FRAGSTATS (McGarigal et al., 2012) to delineate high severity
patches, and their sizes within each treated and untreated unit. The
area-weighted mean (see Turner et al., 2001) was used to
statistically test differences in patch size between high severity
patches in treated and untreated units. In all cases P < 0.05 was
used as a threshold for statistical signiﬁcance (a = 0.05).
3. Results
3.1. Treatment effectiveness: reconstructed forest structure, ﬁre effects
and burn severity
Treatment differences before the wallow ﬁre: Treated units were
designed to meet fuel reduction objectives by removing less ﬁre-
resilient species, resulting in stand conditions that favored ponder-
osa pine and Douglas-ﬁr. Forest fuel reduction treatments resulted
in signiﬁcantly lower basal area and tree density than untreated
units, prior to the Wallow Fire (P = 0.004 for both variables, Table 1,
signiﬁcance denoted by a,b). Reconstructed pre-ﬁre basal area was
lower by an average of 57% and tree density was lower by an aver-
age of 80% in treated units than untreated units (Table 1, signiﬁ-
cance denoted by a,b). Effects of fuel reduction treatments
resulted in signiﬁcantly lower canopy bulk density in treated units
(P = 0.004), averaging 0.05 kg/m3 compared to 0.26 kg/m3 in
untreated units. Diameter distributions pre-ﬁre in the treated area
were unimodal with a peak at the 15-cm and 25-cm diameter class
(Fig. 2). Diameter distributions in the untreated units followed a
reverse j-distribution, indicating strong dominance by small trees,
most of them Douglas-ﬁr and white ﬁr (Fig. 2). Forest composition
was also different (PERMANOVA P = 0.002) between treated and
untreated units prior to the Wallow Fire, reﬂecting the dominance
of ﬁre-adapted species in treated units and of white-ﬁr in the
untreated units.
Wallow ﬁre effects and burn severity: Comparisons within treated
and untreated units from pre-ﬁre reconstructed data showed that
the Wallow Fire signiﬁcantly reduced basal area and tree density
(P = 0.004, for all variables, Table 1, signiﬁcance denoted by bolded
text) from pre-ﬁre conditions for both treated and untreated units.
In treated units, basal area and tree loss ranged from 0.6 to
8.9 m2 ha1
and
from
20
to
375 trees ha1,
respectively.
In
untreated units, burn severity metrics were more extreme; seven
of nine units had BA losses >10 m2 ha1 and density losses
>600 trees ha1 due to the Wallow Fire. Comparisons of severity
metrics between treatment units showed that treated areas had
lower tree basal area loss (P = 0.04) and lower tree mortality
(P = 0.05) when compared to untreated units (Fig. 3). In treated
units, basal area was reduced by 29%, compared to a 55% BA reduc-
tion in untreated areas; tree density reduced by 53% (140 TPH
killed) in treated areas compared to a 74% reduction (600 TPH
killed) in untreated areas. Maximum bole char height showed no
signiﬁcant differences among treatments; treated units averaged
3.5 ± 1.9 m and untreated units averaged 5.4 ± 2.2 m (P = 0.13).
These reductions in basal area and tree mortality were highly
variable in both treated and untreated units. Basal area reductions
varied from 6.7% to 57.1% with a coefﬁcient of variation (CV) of
67.5% in treated units and 19.0–90.7% (CV = 41.1%) in untreated
units. Tree mortality ranged from 25.0% to 82.4% (CV = 41.5%) in
treated units compared to 42.4–98.6% (CV 25.7%) in untreated
units. In treated units, >90% tree mortality occurred in 28% of the
sample plots, and 27% of the plots had <10% mortality, compared
to 52% and 3%, respectively, in untreated plots.
Treatment differences after the wallow ﬁre: While post-ﬁre live-
tree density remained signiﬁcantly lower (P = 0.01) in treated units
than untreated units, basal area (P = 0.20) and forest composition
(PERMANOVA P = 0.65) were statistically similar between treated
and untreated units following the Wallow Fire (Table 1, signiﬁ-
cance denoted by x,y). Tree mortality in both treated and untreated
units occurred predominately in the smaller size classes, shifting
the peak distribution to the 45-cm class in treated units and the
15-cm class in untreated units. Diameter distributions post-ﬁre
in treated units and untreated units both resemble an unimodal
distribution (Fig. 2).
Mortality of large trees (deﬁned as P37.5 cm dbh for conifers
and P20 cm dbh for aspen and Gambel oaks) was lower, but not
signiﬁcant (P = 0.05) in treated units compared to untreated units
(Table 2). Mortality of large ponderosa pine, the most ﬁre-resistant
species in the forest was signiﬁcantly greater (P = 0.008, Table 2,
signiﬁcance denoted by a,b) in untreated units, averaging 42%
(range 10–100%) compared to a 6% average mortality in treated
stands (range from 0% to 20%). Mortality was dominated by large
aspen in the treated units (15.3 tree ha1). Large ponderosa pine
experienced the highest species mortality in untreated units
(15.8 tree ha1), followed by aspen (14.7 tree ha1) and Douglas-

ﬁr (10.3 tree ha1). Species with little resiliency to ﬁre showed no
signiﬁcant differences in mortality rates between treated and
untreated units (aspen, white ﬁr, Gambel oak, Table 2). The ﬁre
signiﬁcantly lowered canopy bulk density in the untreated units
to below thresholds identiﬁed by Cram et al. (2006) and Cruz
et al. (2003) for torching and active crown ﬁre. However, treated
unit average canopy bulk density remained signiﬁcantly less
(P = 0.01) post-ﬁre, averaging 0.02 kg/m3 compared to 0.07 kg/m3
in the untreated units.
3.2. Treatment effectiveness: herbaceous understory response
Total herbaceous understory plant cover was, on average, 1.5
times greater (P = 0.008) in treated units compared to untreated
units, one year following the Wallow Fire (Table 3). Native plant
cover dominated both treated and untreated units composing
89% and 84% of the post-ﬁre vegetation, respectively (Fig. 4). Native
plant cover was signiﬁcantly greater (P = 0.008) in treated units
than untreated units. No distinguishable differences were found

in nonnative cover between treated and untreated units (Fig. 4).
The most common nonnative species were Taraxacum ofﬁcinale
(common
dandelion)
and
two
species
intentionally
seeded
following
the
ﬁre:
Triticum
aestivum
(common
wheat)
and
Hordeum vulgare (common barley). The invasive Bromus tectorum
(cheatgrass) was recorded on 27 plots (15% of all plots). Mean
native graminoid foliar cover was on average twice as high
(P = 0.02) in treated units than untreated units (Table 3). Native
perennials and graminoids were the dominant functional group,
representing 42% and 31% of the total cover across treatments.
Total richness was primarily comprised of native perennial forbs
across both treated and untreated units.
3.3. Treatment effectiveness: high severity patches
High severity patches were signiﬁcantly smaller (P = 0.008) in
treated units compared to untreated units (Fig. 5). In treated units,
31 high severity patches were identiﬁed ranging from 0.09 to
7.9 ha, whereas 47 individual patches ranging from 0.09 to
64.2 ha were identiﬁed in untreated units. Area-weighted mean
for high severity patches was 0.9 ha in treated units and 13.9 ha
in untreated units. High severity patches accounted for 3% of the
treated units and 34% of the untreated sampled units. As shown
in Fig. 5, both the median and the maximum weighted area patch
size are an order of magnitude larger in untreated units than in
treated units.
4. Discussion
We tested the hypotheses that wildﬁre hazard reduction treat-
ments increased ecological resiliency to uncharacteristically severe
ﬁre and that fuel reduction treatments reduced wildﬁre severity in
treated compared with untreated stands.
4.1. Ecosystem resiliency
In this study, we deﬁned ecosystem resiliency for three ecosys-
tem metrics using a combination of known historic reference con-
ditions and empirical data from systems with observed type
changes. Results from this study suggest fuel reduction treatments
increase resiliency to uncharacteristically severe ﬁre as measured
by short-term forest structure attributes. Treated units showed
low tree mortality and small high severity patch sizes, maintaining
a similar ecosystem structure to that reconstructed prior to the
Wallow Fire. The treated units also supported signiﬁcantly higher
understory herbaceous cover; however, nonnative cover metrics of

resiliency showed no differences among treatments one year post-
ﬁre.
Forest structure: We utilized the historic range of variability
(HRV) as a system reference condition to parameterize and charac-
terize overstory metrics of ecosystem resilience (Carpenter et al.,
2001; Rist and Moen, 2013). The use of HRV provides a valid metric
of forest resiliency in the southwestern U.S.A. Adaptive character-
istics of the historic climate, including ﬁre resilient species and for-
est structure, may help retain native species on the landscape with
climate
change
projections
of

ﬁre
probability
(Westerling et al., 2006). A compilation of forest reconstruction
analysis and historical surveys across southwestern warm/dry
mixed conifer forest indicated that historical forest densities fell
between 52 and 255 tree ha1 with stand basal area ranging
between 9.1 and 28.4 m2 ha1 (as summarized in Stoddard, 2011;
Reynolds et al., 2013). In treated stands, reconstructed forest struc-
ture data used to depict pre-ﬁre conditions showed seven of nine
treated units fell within HRV for tree densities and eight treated
units were within the range for basal area. Following the Wallow
Fire, all nine treated units were within HRV for tree density,
whereas ﬁve units fell slightly below HRV for basal area. Untreated
units prior to the ﬁre were on average four times the upper end of
HRV for tree density and 1.2 times above the basal area range. Fol-
lowing the ﬁre, three untreated units were reduced to tree densi-
ties within HRV and seven were within the range for basal area.
These ranges suggest the Wallow Fire resulted in restoration
beneﬁts, even in untreated forests. In fact, the Wallow Fire
appeared to have a thinning effect across treated and untreated
units in which smaller (<40 cm DBH for conifer, <20 cm DBH for
deciduous) and ﬁre-susceptible species (accounting for 78% of all
tree mortality) were killed, similar to Fulé and Laughlin’s (2007)
post-ﬁre ﬁndings in the Grand Canyon, AZ. Reduction in both basal
area and tree density across treated and untreated units were
largely due to decreases in white ﬁr and aspen, tree species less
resilient to ﬁre. These results were reﬂected by the non-signiﬁcant
PERMANOVA analysis post-ﬁre, suggesting the ﬁre had restoration
beneﬁts in untreated units and moved tree composition closer to
historical ranges. In treated units, HRV conditions for forest
composition were maintained following the ﬁre.
Although the Wallow Fire moved density and species composi-
tion towards HRV conditions, other metrics of resiliency showed
differential results between treated and untreated units following
the ﬁre. Large trees are often a metric of forested ecosystem resil-
ience. Large, old trees are the most ﬁre-resistant trees in the stand,
because they have the tallest crown, the thickest bark and are resil-
ient to low-severity ﬁres, which are characteristic of historic ﬁre
regime. Conservation of large, old trees is a priority for restoration
objectives because they represent a rare structural legacy that pro-
vides numerous ecosystem services (Franklin et al., 2000; Abella
et al., 2007). Retaining large trees following a large ﬁre event con-
tributes to the overall ability of the stand to regenerate, maintains
structural components of the forest that contribute to habitat
diversity for dependent wildlife, and contributes to overall stand
resiliency to ﬁre. In untreated units, more than half of large trees
(all species) were killed, compared to a 32% mortality rate in trea-
ted stands (Table 2). Although structurally the BA of seven post-ﬁre
untreated stands fell within the HRV, the high mortality of large
trees in untreated stands resulted in a lack of the large-tree compo-
nent of a reference-condition mixed conifer forest diameter distri-
bution (Fulé et al., 2009).
Understory herbaceous response: Increases in nonnative plant
cover have consequences for native cover and ﬁre return intervals
and can suggest a loss of ecosystem resiliency. For example,
increases in cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) in the Great Basin desert
systems have modiﬁed the ﬁre regime from infrequent ﬁres to a
regime with frequent ﬁre (D’Antonio et al., 2000). Our study
showed nonnatives contributed to just 5% of the total cover on
both treated and untreated sites and were found on 73% of all sam-
pling plots. The understory herbaceous community in the Apache-
Sitgreaves NF mixed conifer forests was uniquely dominated by
grass, unlike shrub-dominated mixed conifer understory commu-
nities more commonly observed in both the intermountain and
Paciﬁc Northwest mixed conifer systems (Agee, 1993; Korb et al.,
2012).
Native understory plant cover was signiﬁcantly greater in trea-
ted units than untreated units one year following the Wallow Fire.
These differences were driven by native perennial and graminoid
species. Post-ﬁre vegetation differences between treated and
untreated units may be due to differences in the pre-ﬁre plant
community; surveys near our study units indicated treated areas
had approximately twice the cover than untreated areas (Sitko
and Hurteau, 2010). These results support observations by Vose
and White (1987) that post-ﬁre understory responses were
strongly linked to the pre-ﬁre community. However, our initial
treatment differences following severe wildﬁre were inconsistent
with other research, which indicated untreated sites were consis-
tently higher in total plant cover than treated sites (Shive et al.,
2013b). Several studies indicate rapid plant recolonization and
increased understory cover in severely burned areas (Crawford
et al., 2001; Grifﬁs et al., 2001). Kuenzi et al. (2008) found that high
burn severity played a greater role in the post-wildﬁre plant com-
munity than fuel treatment. In this study area, the high native
cover in treated units may contribute to rapid soil stabilization
and continued resistance to nonnative species. Future studies are
necessary to determine if herbaceous cover differences remain sig-
niﬁcant through time.
Fire severity and patch size: The warm/dry mixed conifer studied
here can be classiﬁed as frequent ﬁre regimes (Hessburg et al.,
2005; Battaglia and Shepperd, 2007; Margolis et al., 2007, 2013;
Evans et al., 2011), and historically were dominated by surface ﬁre
with small portions of high severity ﬁre (Hessburg et al., 2007;
Collins and Stephens, 2010). In the Wallow Fire, high severity ﬁre
burned over a signiﬁcantly smaller portion of treated units than
in untreated units. The largest high severity patch in the treated
units was just under 8 ha while in untreated units, 75% of high
severity patches were larger than 8 ha. The magnitude of high
severity or stand replacing patches compromises forest ecosystem
resiliency by decreased probability of recovery with similar vegeta-
tion types. If high severity patches are too large, increased dis-
tances to seed sources can impede establishment (Turner et al.,
1998). Long-term studies in ponderosa pine ecosystems have
shown that some areas in high severity burn patches are convert-
ing toward a shrub dominated community with little pine regener-
ation (Savage and Mast, 2005; Roccaforte et al., 2012; Shive et al.,
2013a, but see Haire and MGarigal, 2010), suggesting low resil-
iency of the pre-ﬁre ecosystem to type change. However, long-term
monitoring is needed to assess impacts in mixed conifer.
We found fuel reduction treatments did increase mixed conifer
forest resiliency speciﬁcally for overstory structure metrics, includ-
ing patch size, forest composition and survivorship of large trees.
We also observed signiﬁcantly higher native understory cover in
treated units; however, both native and nonnative cover measured
one year post-ﬁre have too much uncertainty to contribute to the
full understanding of ecosystem resiliency.
4.2. Burn severity
Results from this study support existing empirical evidence and
the hypothesis that fuel treatments reduce ﬁre effects even in
extreme conditions (Raymond and Peterson, 2005; Strom and
Fulé, 2007; Prichard et al., 2010). Wildﬁre burn severity is the mea-
sure of the ecological effect a ﬁre has on a system. Classiﬁcations of

severity in forested systems have long been based on mortality of
trees, measured as the percentage of basal area lost (Agee, 1993);
greater than 70% basal area loss is classiﬁed as high severity; RAVG
data used in this study classiﬁed 75% basal area loss as the high
severity threshold. Treated mixed conifer forests within the Wal-
low Fire perimeter had signiﬁcantly less tree mortality and lower
BA loss than paired untreated units. High severity ﬁre burned over
a signiﬁcantly smaller portion (3% vs. 34%) and with smaller aver-
age patch sizes in the treated units than in the untreated units.
The fuel treatments implemented prior to the 2011 wildﬁre
decreased tree densities by 74–93% and canopy bulk density by
65–93% compared to untreated units, signiﬁcantly reducing the
tree canopy fuel that is necessary component of active crown ﬁre.
The ﬁre hazard reduction treatments accomplished under the
White Mountain Stewardship Project can be considered broadly
successful at reducing ﬁre severity.
4.3. Additional metrics of resilience and study constraints
Not all metrics of resiliency we examined are appropriate for all
systems, and additional metrics are needed for southwestern U.S.
forested systems. Nonnative and native cover proportions may be
more appropriate for systems where invasive nonnatives are pres-
ent and colonization risks are higher. Time of monitoring and
repeated
monitoring
is
important,
as
long-term
understory
responses can take several decades before patterns of establish-
ment and succession become clear. Additional metrics important
to consider in southwestern forests include tree regeneration and
shrub establishment. Reference conditions for understory (herba-
ceous and shrub) composition and abundance and tree regenera-
tion are less available from empirical studies. However, we
suggest these variables would add important long-term resiliency
metrics because some post-burn assessments of frequent-ﬁre sys-
tems have shown type changes from forested systems to grass or
shrub-dominated systems (Savage and Mast, 2005; Roccaforte
et al., 2012; Buma et al., 2013). In large overstory mortality
patches, lack of overstory seed source and subsequent shrub and
grass ﬁre regime effects can maintain the system in a shrub–grass
condition.
This study beneﬁted from but also was constrained by measur-
ing ecosystem conditions one year post-ﬁre. The measurements
allowed the reconstruction of overstory stand conditions prior to
the ﬁre; often, opportunistic studies of landscape-scale distur-
bances are often constrained by a lack of pre-treatment data. This
allowed a better understanding of the post-ﬁre effects on forest
structure. Limitations of the study included potential underesti-
mates of overstory mortality and uncertainty in understory
response. Although future tree mortality changes may alter ﬁnal
trees per hectare killed, the mortality differences among treat-
ments are of the scale that changes in overall patterns are not
expected. In addition, the authors were fortunate that some under-
story data were available adjacent to burned units to more fully
understand understory responses.
The USFS methods of reporting accomplishments can lead to
uncertainties about the actual on-the-ground treatment condition
immediately prior to the ﬁre. It was unclear for some treatment
polygons if ﬁnal fuel treatments, such as slash removal or post-
thinning prescribed ﬁre, were completed. Thinning treatments that
lack residual fuel removal have been shown to contribute to severe
ﬁre effects and overstory mortality (Hudak et al., 2011; Martinson
and Omi, 2013). Another constraint is the limited knowledge of ﬁre
suppression activities. That is, treatments placed around commu-
nities can serve as staging efforts for suppression activities, includ-
ing backburning. However, records and spatial data of these ﬁring
techniques are incomplete in the Wallow Fire (as in many wildland
ﬁres); some treatment ﬁre effects may have been due to suppres-
sion tactics, not the wildﬁre.
4.4. Conclusions and management implications
This study deﬁned three short-term metrics of resiliency for fre-
quent-ﬁre adapted conifer forests and tests the effectiveness of
fuels reduction treatments at maintaining resiliency. This is impor-
tant to federal land managers that currently work under national
policy to ‘‘make our NFS [National Forest Systems] lands more
resilient to climate change. . .’’ (National Forest System, 2012),
but lack any accompanying deﬁnitions of resiliency for their land-
scapes (USDA, 2013). In western U.S. forested systems, treatments
that aid protection of human values and resources will always be
ﬁrst priority for federal land managers. However, this paper shows
fuel reduction treatments can additionally increase speciﬁc resil-
iency metrics of forested ecosystems, even within short-term time-
frames. Not only are Western landscapes seeing increasing risks
from ﬁre to human communities, but landscape-scale ﬁre impacts
the ecological integrity across larger landscapes. This study sug-
gests broader landscape restoration and ﬁre hazard reduction
efforts may be justiﬁed to increase resilience across the landscape.
