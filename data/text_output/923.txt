The greater than 200,000 ha Wallow Fire of May-July 2011 burned through mixed-conifer and ponderosa pine
forests in Arizona and New Mexico in the southwestern U.S. This “mega-ﬁre” set the stage for an opportunistic
study to examine understory plant community responses to pre-ﬁre fuel reduction treatments in areas dominated
by dry mixed-conifer forests. In 2016, ﬁve years after the ﬁre, we remeasured nine pairs of treated and untreated
sites that were installed in 2012 and compared understory characteristics including species cover, richness and
community composition. Native plant cover was signiﬁcantly higher (20% total cover) in areas that were treated
for fuel reduction before the ﬁre compared with untreated areas (17% cover), despite the variability in ﬁre
severity and tree mortality. Non-native plant cover was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between treated and untreated
units. Herbaceous understory cover was negatively correlated (p < 0.05) with total tree basal area and tree
canopy cover in treated as well as untreated units, and positively correlated with tree mortality and basal area
mortality in the untreated units. In the treated units, species richness and diversity were negatively (r = −0.62
to −0.63) correlated with insolation and elevation. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordinations along with
univariate results suggested that community composition was driven by increased insolation following loss of
tree canopy. Cover of species that beneﬁt from high light and warmer temperatures, such as some shrubs and
perennial graminoids, increased from 2012 to 2016. Overall, fuel reduction treatments led to persistent increases
in cover of native species, lending weight to the usefulness of hazardous fuel reduction treatments in promoting
native plant cover.
1. Introduction
Mega-ﬁres are often deﬁned by their size (e.g. > 10,000 ha) while
also carrying “enormous and often lasting unwanted human, economic,
and environmental consequences” and frequently result in wide ranging
political actions (Williams, 2013). The heightened risk of unnaturally
severe mega-ﬁres in warm-dry mixed-conifer forests has led to ecolo-
gical restoration and hazardous fuel reduction eﬀorts across the
southwestern USA. These endeavors generally involve tree thinning,
prescribed burning and/or managed ﬁre to restore forest structure and
reduce hazardous fuel levels (Mason et al., 2007; Margolis et al., 2013;
Abella and Springer, 2015). Strategic fuel treatments and managing low
intensity wildﬁres for resource objectives are additional actions that
may assist in conservation of mixed-conifer forest ecosystems (Wilkin
et al., 2016). With expected increases in large wildﬁres in conjunction
with climate change (Westerling et al., 2006; Littell et al., 2009;
Schoennagel et al., 2017), determining the impact of pre-ﬁre fuel
treatments on understory plant communities is key for decision making.
Wildﬁres that burn over treated areas provide important opportunities
to examine eﬀects of pre-ﬁre treatments on ecosystem responses
(Stevens-Rumann et al., 2013; Waltz et al., 2014).
The southwestern mixed-conifer forest habitat type covers ca 1
million ha in the states of Arizona and New Mexico (Dieterich, 1983).
Occurring at approximately 2250–3000 m elevation, this forest type is
situated between the ponderosa pine zone below and the spruce-alpine
ﬁr zone above (Pase and Brown, 1994; Grissino-Mayer et al., 1995).
Southwestern mixed-conifer forests display wide variation in species
composition and environmental characteristics and are further sub-
divided into cool/wet and warm/dry phases related to aspect, slope
position, etc. (see Romme et al., 2009; Margolis et al., 2013; Reynolds
et al., 2013). Diﬀerences between dry and wet types may have major
impacts on ﬁre behavior. Wetter and cooler forests generally occupy

north-facing aspects, often contain ﬁr and spruce species, and are
mostly forb-dominated, while warm-dry forests tend toward more
grass-dominated understories, lower elevations, and more southerly
aspects (Romme et al., 2009). Research based on evidence from ﬁre-
scarred trees indicates warm-dry forests of this region have experienced
a disruption of the natural frequent low-severity surface ﬁre regime
over the last century (Reynolds et al., 2013). In addition to Pinus pon-
derosa (ponderosa pine), which is often an indicator of the warm-dry
type, dominant tree species include Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-ﬁr),
Abies concolor (white ﬁr), Populus tremuloides (quaking aspen), as well as
Pinus ﬂexilis (limber pine) and/or P. strobiformis (southwestern white
pine) (Pase and Brown, 1994). Plant species richness and diversity in
these forests is often high. Because of the complexity of these forests in
terms of soils, slope, aspect, moisture and ﬁre regimes and dominant
overstory species, the eﬀects of fuel treatments and ﬁre on community
responses can be correspondingly variable.
Fire scar records indicate that until roughly the beginning of the
20th century, southwestern warm-dry mixed-conifer forests displayed a
low-severity, frequent-ﬁre regime at roughly 2–30 year intervals with
only small patches of high severity ﬁre (Fulé et al., 2009; Margolis
et al., 2013; Reynolds et al., 2013; Huﬀman et al., 2015). Recurring ﬁre
likely constrained conifer regeneration, limited the accumulation of
woody surface fuels on the forest ﬂoor and may have created conditions
for a greater abundance of herbaceous vegetation that contributed to
ﬁne fuel loading and surface ﬁre spread. With increased grazing pres-
sure and the active suppression of ﬁre, concurrent with climate
changes, there has since been an inﬂux of tree species, some of which
are shade-tolerant and ﬁre-intolerant. These include white ﬁr and
Douglas-ﬁr, which would have historically been limited by a frequent
ﬁre regime (Moir and Ludwig, 1979; Romme et al., 2009; Strahan et al.,
2016). Fire exclusion in combination with selective logging have re-
sulted in forests now dominated by a homogeneous structure of young,
small, mostly shade-tolerant and ﬁre-intolerant conifer species (Romme
et al., 2009; Margolis et al., 2013). Whether these changes reﬂect si-
milar changes in understory composition or among certain forest stand
types is unknown (Korb et al., 2007), but the overall eﬀect, not only in
the Southwest but across western North America, appears to be a de-
crease in understory plant cover in mixed-conifer forests over the past
century (Abella and Springer, 2015). Research from yellow pine and
mixed-conifer montane forests on the west side of the central Sierra
Nevada of California indicates that disturbances such as severe wildﬁre
leading to canopy opening can further accelerate species compositional
changes to favor those species that exhibit a more xeric or southern
biogeographic aﬃnity while disfavoring those with a more mesic or
north-temperate aﬃnity that may be less ﬁre-adapted (Stevens et al.,
2015). Although we don’t yet know if this pattern also occurs following
wildﬁre in Arizona mixed-conifer forests, it is worthy of further in-
vestigation.
In a systematic review of published literature, Abella and Springer
(2015) reported that thinning and prescribed ﬁre tended to reduce
understory abundance in the ﬁrst four years following hazardous fuels
reduction
treatments
in
mixed-conifer
forests
of
western
North
America. Similarly, numerous other studies have investigated unders-
tory responses to fuel treatments in frequent-ﬁre forests; however, re-
sults have been mixed in terms of cover, biomass and non-native species
cover responses, likely due to factors other than treatment, such as soil
type, treatment intensity, ﬁre severity and time since ﬁre (Strom and
Fulé, 2007; Stevens-Rumann et al., 2012; Shive et al., 2013a, 2013b;
Stevens-Rumann et al., 2013; Cram et al., 2015; Kalies and Yocom Kent,
2016). Stevens et al. (2015) found that community traits in Sierra Ne-
vada mixed-conifer forests were altered after wildﬁre and thinning,
shifting toward greater abundance of drought-tolerant species. Others
have noted immediate increases in non-native species after wildﬁre in
southwestern ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests (Kuenzi et al.,
2008; Shive et al., 2013b; Fornwalt and Kaufmann, 2014). Few data are
available that describe more than ﬁve years of understory responses to
fuels treatments in mixed-conifer ecosystems (Abella and Springer,
2015), or that can be used to compare dynamics of pre-ﬁre-treated sites
with those of untreated sites following wildﬁre (but see Waltz et al.,
2014). Lastly, little is understood concerning species composition shifts
after fuels treatments and wildﬁre, and their implications with respect
to climate change.
In 2004, a landscape-scale stewardship project, the White Mountain
Stewardship Project, was implemented to reduce hazardous fuels and to
protect human communities from severe ﬁre in the White Mountains of
eastern Arizona at the wildland-urban interface (WUI) (Sitko and
Hurteau, 2010; Hurteau, 2016). Subsequent to the project, the human-
caused Wallow Fire of May-July 2011 burned over 200,000 ha of
mixed-conifer and ponderosa pine forest and set the stage for an op-
portunistic examination of longer-term understory plant community
responses to pre-ﬁre fuel reduction treatments in areas dominated by
mixed-conifer forests. In 2016, we remeasured nine pairs of treated and
untreated sites that were installed in 2012 to examine the connection
between treatments and ecosystem resilience and to test plant com-
munity responses to fuel treatments, particularly in terms of diﬀerences
in native cover and species richness between treated and untreated
areas (Waltz et al., 2014). Our main research questions were the fol-
lowing: (1) Five years after wildﬁre, were there diﬀerences in native
and non-native species cover, richness, and diversity between treated
and untreated areas? (2) Was there a convergence in species composi-
tion between treated and untreated areas after ﬁve years? (3) What
environmental factors, such as ﬁre severity, tree mortality, slope, or
aspect, aﬀected species composition? (4) Were there shifts in compo-
sition toward drought- and/or heat-tolerant species over time?
2. Methods
2.1. Study sites
We located our study sites in warm-dry mixed-conifer forest eco-
systems on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest (A-S NF) in eastern
Arizona in areas that had been thinned prior to the Wallow Fire by the
U.S. Forest Service as part of the White Mountain Stewardship Project
(Sitko and Hurteau, 2010; Hurteau, 2016). In some areas, logging slash
was piled and burned, and in others the slash was removed and pro-
cessed oﬀ-site. This endeavor encompassed WUI-associated fuel re-
duction treatments near the human communities of Greer, Alpine and
Nutrioso (Fig. 1). Elevations ranged from 2469 to 2838 m. Co-dominant
tree species included Pinus ponderosa, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Quercus
gambelii (Gambel oak) with dispersed patches of Populus tremuloides and
Robinia neomexicana (New Mexico locust), particularly following the
ﬁre (Waltz et al., 2014). Characteristic understory species of more
mesic microsites included Maianthemum stellatum (starry false Solo-
mon’s-seal), Pyrola picta (white-veined wintergreen), Goodyera ob-
longifolia (rattlesnake plantain), Viola spp. (violet), and Valeriana acu-
tiloba (Cordilleran valerian) and various species of orchids and gentians.
In drier and sunnier openings, common species included grasses such as
Agrostis spp. (bentgrass), Bromus spp. (brome), Festuca spp. (fescue), Poa
fendleriana (muttongrass), Koeleria macrantha (Junegrass) Muhlenbergia
montana (mountain muhly) and Carex geophila (White Mountain sedge),
and a wide variety of forbs, particularly members of the Asteraceae
family. Common shrubs included Symphoricarpos spp. (snowberry),
Ribes spp. (currant), and Rubus spp. (raspberry). The majority of the
study site was on soils classiﬁed as Eutric Glossoboralfs (ﬁne-loamy,
mixed, and loamy-skeletal, mixed). These soils are moderately deep and
well-drained and formed in residuum and/or colluvium from basalt and
sandstone. They are on nearly level to moderately steep elevated plains
and hills with slopes of 0–40%. Most of the remaining study area was on
soils classiﬁed as Mollic Eutroboralfs which consist of moderately deep
and deep, well-drained soils that formed in residuum, colluvium and
alluvium derived from basalt, cinders and sandstone. They are formed
on nearly level plains to steep slopes of 0–40% (Laing et al., 1989).

The human-caused Wallow Fire was ignited on May 29, 2011 and
eventually consumed 217,741 ha in eastern Arizona and Catron County
in western New Mexico before being fully contained on July 8, 2011
(Inciweb, 2012). Our study sites were located at the northern extent of
the ﬁre in an area that burned June 4–9, 2011. During this timeframe,
the ﬁre burned between 16,250 and 30,850 total ha each day (Inciweb,
2012; Waltz et al., 2014). The two closest Remote Automated Weather
Stations (RAWS) at Alpine and Greer, AZ recorded maximum air tem-
peratures during this time period between 23.3 and 25.0 °C; daily
minimum and maximum relative humidity of 6–16 and 23–53%, re-
spectively; dew points of −14 to −3 °C; and maximum wind speeds of
38.6–67.6 kph out of the south-southwest (Waltz et al., 2014; Western
Regional Climate Center, 2017). Over the entire ﬁre footprint, the
Burned Area Reﬂectance Classiﬁcation process (BARC), a satellite-de-
rived data layer of post-ﬁre vegetation condition, identiﬁed approxi-
mately 17% of the area as experiencing high soil burn severity, 14%
was identiﬁed as moderate severity and 69% fell into the low or un-
burned category (Wadleigh, 2011). Total annual precipitation in the
study area averages 52.7 cm and falls in a bimodal pattern with winter
snowfall and summer monsoonal precipitation. However, a strong bi-
modal precipitation pattern was absent the year prior to the ﬁre, and
winter precipitation provided only about 8% of annual total pre-
cipitation in the winter of 2010–2011 (Waltz et al., 2014). Total pre-
cipitation in the twelve months prior to data collection in 2012 and
2016 was 45.1 and 50.1 cm (86% and 95% of average total annual
precipitation), respectively (Fig. 2).
Seed mixes, which often include sterile cereal grains, are widely
used for erosion mitigation following high-severity ﬁres (Beyers, 2004;
Robichaud et al., 2013). As a part of Burned Area Emergency Response
(BAER) rehabilitation treatments based partially on soil burn severity
classiﬁcation from BARC, BAER teams mulched and seeded 21% of
plots in the treated units and 36% of plots in the untreated units with a
high elevation commercial seed mix consisting of ﬁve native and two
non-native grass species (20 seeds per square foot PLS). The seed mix
included native grass species (Festuca arizonica (Arizona fescue), Festuca
idahoensis (Idaho fescue), Poa fendleriana (muttongrass), Elymus tra-
chycaulus ssp. trachycaulus (slender wheatgrass), and Bromus marginatus
(mountain brome)), and two non-native sterile cereal grains (Triticum
aestivum (annual wheat) and Hordeum vulgare (annual barley)).
2.2. Experimental design
We utilized a quasi-experimental design (Shadish et al., 2002) and
sampled nine pairs of treated–untreated units (as described in Waltz
et al., 2014) (Fig. 1). Treated units were selected based on the following
set of criteria: (1) warm-dry mixed-conifer forest type with similar
slopes and soil types; (2) treated for fuel hazard reduction within ten
years prior to the Wallow Fire; (3) greater than twelve ha in size; and
(4) burned by the Wallow Fire. The untreated paired units were located
geographically close to treated units (but independent of or not aﬀected
by them), presented similar topography, and were within the same ﬁre
progression day (24-hr period) (Waltz et al., 2014). A geographic in-
formation system (GIS) was used to overlay systematic point grids
(100 × 100 m) on treated and untreated site polygons. Ten points were
randomly selected at each site for the establishment of ﬁeld sample
plots (18 units × 10 plots = 180 plots). We avoided edge eﬀects with a
100-m buﬀer separating plots from the treatment perimeter (Waltz
et al., 2014). Treatments studied included non-commercial or pre-
commercial mechanical thinning followed by residual fuel removal
(mechanically or broadcast burned) prior to the ﬁre. Due to incomplete
information we were unable to determine exactly where each of these
treatments was conducted in relation to our study plots, so speciﬁc
types of treatments were not included as a part of our analysis.
2.3. Data collection
Sample plots were measured July-August in 2012 and 2016. Fifty-
meter herbaceous transects were installed in 2012 and aligned per-
pendicular to the general slope of each plot, with the halfway point
located at plot center. Understory measurements were collected along
the 50-m transect. Species richness was collected in a 500-m2 (10 × 50-
m) rectangle spanning both sides of the transect. Cover (%) of vascular
plant species < 137 cm (DBH) in height was visually estimated and

recorded in ﬁve 1-m2 (0.5 × 2-m) quadrats systematically located at
10-m intervals along the transect. There is incongruity in the literature
over the deﬁnition of cover estimates for plant species. Fehmi (2010)
deﬁnes species cover as “the cover for each plant species evaluated
independently from the cover of other species. It is the independent
aerial cover of each species, as if no others occurred in the sample area,
expressed as a percentage of the area occupied by each species. The sum
of the combined species covers can exceed 100%, but each individual
species cannot have a cover that exceeds 100%.” In addition, we also
estimated total percent basal cover of all vascular plants < 137 cm, as
well as percent cover of substrates (litter, bare soil, wood, rock, etc.) in
each quadrat. Unknown plant species were collected and keyed. Tax-
onomy was assigned using the Integrated Taxonomic System (www.itis.
gov), and nativity of plant species was assigned using the USDA Plants
Database (www.plants.usda.gov). We also collected data on all trees in
a 400 m2 plot surrounding the understory transect, and these data were
used in our correlation analysis. Measurements included species, con-
dition (living or snag/log classes), height, and DBH.
2.4. Data analysis
To address our research questions focusing on whether there were
diﬀerences in plant cover between treated and untreated areas and
whether species composition began to converge over time in treat-
ments, we analyzed diﬀerences in pre- and post-ﬁre species cover
(Fehmi, 2010) and richness of all woody and herbaceous species <
137 cm, one and ﬁve years after the ﬁre, using a Wilcoxon signed-rank
test (SAS JMP Version Pro 13 (SAS Institute Inc.)). Quadrat data were
summarized for each plot and plot data within units were averaged to
produce a single value for each understory variable in each treated and
untreated unit (n = 9). To determine which environmental factors, such
as ﬁre severity, tree mortality, slope, or aspect, aﬀected species com-
position, we examined how species cover, richness and diversity of
understory species varied between the treatments and assessed re-
lationships between biotic and abiotic variables and understory vege-
tation with tree mortality and basal area mortality calculated as sur-
rogates of ﬁre severity, using Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcients (SAS
JMP Version Pro 13 (SAS Institute Inc.)). To assess compositional dif-
ferences we used nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) (PC-ORD
software version 7.02; McCune and Meﬀord, 2015) using both year and
treatment as factors to ordinate the plant community data (Peck, 2016).
We
also
calculated
a
distance-based
MANOVA
(perMANOVA)
(Anderson, 2001) with Bray–Curtis dissimilarity distance measure
(Faith et al., 1987), and an indicator species analysis (ISA) using the
Dufrêne and Legendre (1997) method (PC-ORD version 7.02). Topo-
graphic Position Index (TPI) and other landform variables were ob-
tained using Topographic Position Index (TPI) v. 1.2 (Jenness, 2006),
which is an extension that calculates TPI grids from elevation grids and
then classiﬁes the landscape into slope position and landform cate-
gories. These same analyses were used to assess whether shifts in
composition toward drought- and/or heat-tolerant species occurred
over time.
3. Results
3.1. Species cover, richness, and diversity
By 2016, total plant cover in untreated units had increased to nearly
the same levels as the treated units, which had the advantage of several
years of growth following the fuel treatments that were implemented
prior to the Wallow Fire. Total cover was signiﬁcantly greater in treated
units at 22.3% compared with untreated units at 19.6% (p > 0.05)
(Table 1). Of the various functional groups, understory tree cover was
signiﬁcantly higher in treated units (2.4%) than untreated units (1.4%),
whereas cover of annual forbs was distinctively higher in untreated
units (1.7%) compared to treated units (0.7%).
In 2012, the overall mean native plant cover was 10.9% in treated
units and 6.8% in untreated units (Waltz et al., 2014). It increased to
20.0% in treated and 17.0% in untreated units by 2016 and remained
signiﬁcantly higher in treated units compared with untreated units (p-
value = 0.05). The overall mean for non-native cover was not sig-
niﬁcantly diﬀerent between treated and untreated units in either 2012
or 2016, ranging from 1% for both treated and untreated units in 2012
to 2.3 and 2.6% in the treated and untreated units, respectively, in 2016
(Fig. 3). The ratio of non-native to native plant cover was signiﬁcantly
higher in untreated units in 2012 but not in 2016 (Fig. 3). The most
common non-native species in 2012 in terms of frequency in the treated
units were Taraxacum oﬃcinale (common dandelion), Verbascum
thapsus, Poa pratensis, and the two seeded grains Triticum aestivum and
Hordeum vulgare. These same species were also the most common non-
native species recorded in the untreated units. In 2016 Verbascum
thapsus and Poa pratensis were the most frequently recorded non-native
species in both treated and untreated units. Although relatively low in
mean absolute cover both years, Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) con-
tinued to increase in coverage and frequency by 2016, particularly in
the units near Greer and Nutrioso. In addition to B. tectorum, species

recorded in 2016 and considered to be noxious or invasive weeds in-
cluded Carduus nutans (musk thistle), Cirsium vulgare (bull thistle),
Erodium cicutarium (redstem ﬁlaree), Leucanthemum vulgare (oxeye
daisy), Melilotus oﬃcinalis (yellow sweetclover) and Tragopogon dubius
(common salsify).
Graminoids, and speciﬁcally perennial grasses, were primary drivers
of the plant community richness response in 2016. Graminoids re-
presented 9.9% and 6.9% total cover, respectively, in treated and un-
treated units (Table 1). Thirteen sedges (Carex sp.), ﬁve rushes (Juncus
sp.) and 62 grass species were recorded over the course of the study.
Over the ﬁve years of the study, we recorded 437 unique species,
representing 65 plant families, in both the treated and untreated units.
In 2012, we recorded 294 species in the treated units and 314 in the
untreated units (371 species total). In 2016 we recorded 271 species in
the treated units and 304 in the untreated units (347 total). Species
richness was not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by treatment or by year, nor did
richness of functional groups vary signiﬁcantly by treatment or year.
There were also no signiﬁcant diﬀerences detected in diversity between
treated and untreated units in 2016 (based on the Shannon diversity
index).
3.2. Correlations with environmental variables
Species cover at the sample plot-level was signiﬁcantly and nega-
tively correlated with total tree basal area and tree canopy cover in
treated units as well as untreated units, and positively correlated with
tree mortality and basal area mortality in the untreated units, but not
the treated units, in 2016 (Table 2). Species richness showed positive
signiﬁcant correlations with tree mortality and basal area mortality in
the untreated units, and negative, signiﬁcant correlations with topo-
graphic position index (TPI) (Jenness, 2006), insolation, and elevation
in both the treated and untreated units. Similar patterns were observed
with species diversity (Shannon diversity index) (Table 2). We found no
signiﬁcant correlations between species cover and percent mineral soil
cover, TPI, insolation, elevation, slope or aspect. In either treated or
untreated units, there was a negative correlation between species cover
and tree basal area (BA) (Table 2). Tree mortality and basal area
mortality both indicated a signiﬁcant, positive correlation with species
cover (r = 0.60 for both; p-value < 0.001). In the treated units, we
found signiﬁcant negative correlations (ranging from r = −0.62 to
−0.63; p-value < 0.001) between species richness and diversity and
insolation and elevation (Table 2).
3.3. Community analysis
Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordinations (NMS) of treat-
ments within years, and treatments between years, indicated that ele-
vation and richness were reﬂective of plant community compositional
diﬀerences between treated and untreated units in 2012 at a plot level
(Fig. 4a). In 2016 the main drivers of plant community diﬀerences were
slope and aspect (Fig. 4b). An ordination comparing treated units in
2012 and 2016 yielded no explanatory variables (Fig. 4c). However, a
comparison of 2012 to 2016 in the untreated units indicated that four
explanatory environmental variables (insolation, elevation, aspect, and
slope) were correlated with the ordination axes and were primary dri-
vers of the plant community over time (Fig. 4d; only insolation and
slope are shown due to overlap on the graph between slope/aspect and
insolation/elevation).
Based on an indicator species analysis (ISA), several of the species
responsible for compositional diﬀerences between the treated and un-
treated units at a plot level were woody species, including Pinus pon-
derosa (IV of 43), Populus tremuloides (45) Pseudotsuga menziesii (26),
Ribes pinetorum (orange gooseberry) (33) and Rubus idaeus (32) (all p
values signiﬁcant at < 0.05) (Table 3). A large number of species were
indicative of diﬀerences between the plant communities in 2012 and
2016 (Table 3). Those indicative of conditions in 2012 tended to be
ruderal, wind-dispersed or those that are emergent during the monsoon
season. This group also included the two seeded cereal grains. While
many of these ruderal species also had high IVs in 2016, several woody
species, perennial graminoids and wind-dispersed perennial forbs also
exceeded the cutoﬀvalue. The results of a perMANOVA, which tested
for diﬀerences in means between treatments revealed no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in plant community composition in either 2012 or 2016.

4. Discussion
4.1. Species cover, richness, and diversity
Five years after the Wallow Fire, total species cover was sig-
niﬁcantly higher in areas treated for fuel reduction prior to the ﬁre,
when compared to untreated areas. The increased cover of perennial
graminoids between 2012 (one-year post-ﬁre) and 2016 appeared to be
a driving factor, regardless of treatment. Although we did not ﬁnd
signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the plant community composition in
treated and untreated areas based on perMANOVA, there were large
increases in cover of some species spanning a range of functional groups
in both treated and untreated areas, most likely due to the colonization
and persistence of more xeric species following ﬁre-induced tree mor-
tality.
Non-native cover was relatively low in 2016, (2.3 and 2.6% in the
treated and untreated units, respectively) and non-native species made
up 10–13% of the total cover from 2012 to 2016. Our non-native cover
percentages as absolute values are in alignment with several other
studies in Arizona frequent-ﬁre forests. As an example, Huisinga et al.
(2005) reported what they considered to be low cover and richness of
non-native species in an intensely burned area of mixed-conifer forest
on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon six years (richness of one non-
native species per plot, < 3% cover) and eight years (1.9 species per
plot, 5% cover) after ﬁre. Kuenzi et al. (2008) reported low cover
(< 4% that did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly between treatments) and rich-
ness of non-native species in a previously treated ponderosa pine forest
burned by the Rodeo-Chediski Fire, a mega-ﬁre that also occurred in
eastern Arizona not far from our study area. Data collected eight years
later on the Rodeo-Chediski site revealed slightly lower non-native
cover across the study area (< 2%) (Shive et al., 2013b).
Of the thirty non-native species we recorded across the study site in
2016, only one is listed as the highest priority of noxious or invasive
species on the A-S NF. Carduus nutans is a Class A, Treatment Priority 1
noxious or invasive weed (poses a serious threat to agricultural crops,
rangelands or listed plants and other natural resources in the state)
(White, 2008). Bromus tectorum, Cirsium vulgare, Erodium cicutarium,
Melilotus oﬃcinalis and Verbascum thapsus are all listed as Class C,
Treatment Priority 3 weeds (noxious and invasive weeds receiving the
lowest priority for treatment) (White, 2008). Carduus nutans can invade
large areas of the landscape in these forests in the absence of control
measures. Bromus tectorum also presents a risk but has proven diﬃcult
to eradicate in the Southwest.
Several compositional dynamics were observed on both treated and
untreated sites and between years. Factors other than treatment that
likely inﬂuenced our results included rates of seed dispersal and

of 0.300), (d) untreated only, 2012 vs. 2016 (r2 cutoﬀof 0.300). Because of overlap between insolation/elevation and slope/aspect, only two variables are shown in

weather patterns. When we compared species frequency and indicator
values between 2012 and 2016, we observed an increase in frequency
of wind-dispersed species, including primarily grasses and members of
the Asteraceae (composite) family. Accurate data on long-term seed
dispersal rates have been lacking in the published research until re-
cently (Cain et al., 2000). Large, gravity- or mammal-dispersed seeds
have generally been believed to recruit along the edge of a disturbance,
particularly a large, high-severity event such as wildﬁre (Turner et al.,
1998). However, plant height has been found to more strongly predict
dispersal distance than does seed mass, and species dispersed by ani-
mals through ingestion, attachment or seed caching generally disperse
farther than species that utilize wind for dispersal (Thomson et al.,
2011; Heydel et al., 2014). Our results suggest that wind-dispersed
species quickly colonized the area burned by the ﬁre and continued to
increase and persist into 2016.
In addition, we observed a decrease in 2016 of species such as
Dysphania graveolens and Muhlenbergia minutissima (annual muhly) that
typically emerge in response to summer monsoonal rains. The absence
of a strong monsoonal precipitation pattern and an overall below
average amount of precipitation in 2016 likely contributed to decreased
richness in 2016 when compared to 2012. Several species that emerge
following summer rains, and that were commonly recorded in 2012,
were much reduced in cover and abundance or not recorded at all in
2016. We expect that many of these monsoonal species will persist in
the soil seed bank and will be present during years of average or above-
average monsoonal precipitation.
Likewise, many of the early-successional or ruderal species were not
as common in 2016. A pattern of increased abundance of ruderals
would be expected immediately following such a large-scale dis-
turbance event, but would be expected to gradually decrease through
time (Laughlin and Fulé, 2008). Although we observed a decrease in
some ruderal or disturbance-dependent species, such as Chenopodium
capitatum (strawberry-blite) and Corydalis aurea (golden corydalis),
other ruderal species continued to increase in frequency and to become
dominant species in the plant community through 2016.
We also observed a sharp decrease in the two seeded grains in 2016.
It is not surprising that the seeded sterile wheat and barley decreased
over time and eventually moved out of the burned area. Kuenzi et al.
(2008) similarly found that seeded sterile wheat declined by three years
after the Rodeo-Chediski Fire. Five native grass species were seeded by
BAER teams after the Wallow Fire. All were already present in the A-S
NF, so we were unable to determine if their presence and increases in
cover and frequency post-ﬁre were due to seeding or natural occur-
rence.
4.2. Correlations with environmental variables
Using BARC to assess soil burn severity, a USFS Rapid Assessment
Team reported that 22% of the Wallow Fire footprint was unburned,
47% was low severity, 14% was moderate severity, and 17% was high
severity (Wadleigh, 2011). Vegetation burn severity is diﬃcult to assess
(Saﬀord et al., 2008). However, within the dry mixed-conifer type,
high-severity ﬁre was more prevalent than on the ﬁre as a whole.
Roccaforte (2013) reports that 16% of the dry mixed-conifer within the
Wallow Fire perimeter within Arizona was classiﬁed as unburned, 21%
as low severity, about 15% as moderate severity, and about 48% as high
severity.
Our study was not designed to assess vegetation burn severity or to
examine cause and eﬀect of various environmental factors, but in the
untreated areas, we did ﬁnd positive correlations between ﬁre-induced
tree mortality and plant cover as well as negative correlations between
TPI, insolation and elevation and plant cover. These results suggest a
shift primarily toward higher perennial graminoid cover at lower ele-
vations in areas that experienced high severity ﬁre and high tree mor-
tality. However, variation in species richness and diversity, rather than
showing obvious and signiﬁcant trends between treated and untreated
areas, may be occurring at smaller scales (e.g., unit/site or plot level).
For example, microsites along streams typically have much higher
richness and diversity than the surrounding forest.
4.3. Community responses
Strahan et al. (2016) found contemporary mixed-conifer forest tree
assemblages to have signiﬁcantly lower multitrait functional diversity
than pre-settlement forests and to be less dominated by ﬁre-tolerant and
shade-intolerant tree species than in the late 19th century. Such func-
tional shifts are thought to be due to anthropogenic ﬁre exclusion and
selective timber harvests (Strahan et al., 2016). It would be reasonable
to assume that the understory plant community in untreated units of
our study had a signiﬁcant component of ﬁre-intolerant and shade-
tolerant species prior to the Wallow Fire. Decreases in cover of shade-
tolerant understory species, such as Pyrola sp. and recruitment of an-
nual and biennial forbs can occur following ﬁre-induced tree mortality
(Laughlin and Fulé, 2008). Results of our analyses indicated that

untreated units became more similar to treated units ﬁve years after the
ﬁre and treated and untreated communities began to converge com-
positionally, as well as in overall understory cover. This was likely due
to tree mortality and reduced canopy cover in untreated units as well as
reduced belowground competition (Metlen and Fiedler, 2006), leading
to increases in shade intolerant, ﬁre-tolerant species in the community.
In addition, Bray-Curtis distance measures and NMS ordinations
suggest that species composition changes are also being driven by
physical environmental factors including slope, aspect, insolation and
elevation. Thus, reduced tree canopy in concert with site factors such as
slope and aspect have favored increases in ruderal and wind-dispersed
species, particularly grasses and members of the Asteraceae. Fornwalt
and Kaufmann (2014) reported that the degree of post-ﬁre composi-
tional change following the Hayman Fire in central Colorado was highly
dependent on burn severity. Shive et al. (2013b) found plant commu-
nities to be distinctly diﬀerent following the Rodeo-Chediski in the
early years of the study between pre-ﬁre treated and untreated areas.
However, six and seven years later, the communities had begun to
converge, possibly due to colonization across these areas through wind
dispersal and other modes of seed transport. Likewise, the treated and
untreated areas in our study were fairly similar compositionally in
2016, even as they have shifted over time toward communities domi-
nated by perennial grasses and other species that can tolerate more
xeric conditions promoted by loss of live tree canopy cover (Stevens
et al., 2015).
5. Conclusions
In this study we examined species compositional changes ﬁve years
after a mega-wildﬁre in areas that were treated as part of a landscape
hazardous fuel reduction project. Understory species cover was sig-
niﬁcantly higher ﬁve years after the Wallow Fire in areas that were
treated as part of the fuel reduction project despite the variability in ﬁre
severity and tree mortality across the ﬁre. Our results suggest that fuel
reduction treatments led to increased cover of native species im-
mediately following the ﬁre and that this increased cover is still evident
and persistent ﬁve years later, lending weight to the usefulness of ha-
zardous fuel reduction treatments in promoting native plant cover.
However, likely because of more open conditions across much of the
ﬁre’s footprint, non-native species such as Bromus tectorum, Carduus
nutans, Cirsium vulgare, Poa compressa (Canada bluegrass), Poa pratensis,
Rumex acetosella (sheep sorrel), and Tragopogon dubius (yellow salsify)
are increasing in frequency across the study area. Our results suggest
that community composition is being driven by increased insolation
following loss of tree canopy. Species that beneﬁt from the increased
light and temperatures, such as some shrubs, wind-dispersed forbs, and
perennial graminoids, have increased in cover and frequency following
hazardous fuel treatments and wildﬁre. Warmer drier climatic condi-
tions are likely to drive increases in large mega-ﬁres in mixed-conifer
forests of the Southwest and to lead to a plant community more tolerant
of drought and warm temperatures. Additional long-term studies that
elucidate interactions of wildﬁre, ecological restoration, and hazardous
fuel treatments are extremely useful. These studies will be valuable for
improving conservation of forest ecosystems in a changing climate.
