The utilization of forest residues as a woody biomass feedstock for the production of bioenergy and
bioproducts requires processing (i.e., comminution) to meet feedstock speciﬁcations, such as moisture
content and particle size. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of small diameter
processed hardwood (SH) and small and large diameter processed softwood (SS and LS) stems had on the
productivity and cost of a track mounted sawdust machine that produced sawdust. In addition, moisture
content, particle size distribution, bulk density, and the effect of knife wear were evaluated. The sawdust
machine's 298-kW engine was capable of comminuting all material types except the LH stems. The
machine's productivity ranged between 18.3 and 26.7 bone-dry metric ton (BDmT)/productive machine
hour (PMH) at a cost of US $5.3 and US $3.6/BDmT, respectively. The moisture content of material used in
the study ranged between 26 and 36%. The geometric mean particle lengths for SH, SS, and LS were 4.7,
5.3, and 4.4 mm, respectively. The machine could not process LH materials due to limited power. The bulk
density of feedstock produced ranged between 234 and 281 kg/m3. Analysis indicated that knife wear did
not have a signiﬁcant effect on comminution productivity and feedstock quality while comminuting 60
green metric tons (GmT) of forest residues. The results from this study suggest that this sawdust machine
can be useful in producing feedstock for new biomass conversion technologies that require small, uni-
form particles.

1. Introduction
Forest residues in the form of tree tops, limbs, and non-
merchantable trees are a potential source of feedstock for pro-
ducing bioenergy (e.g., heat and electricity) and bioproducts
including liquid fuels, biochar, torreﬁed wood, pellets, briquettes,
and nanocellulosic ﬁbers [1e4].
Grinding, which produces hogfuel by hammering material into
smaller pieces has been shown to be highly effective at commi-
nuting material heterogenous in size that may be contaminated
with soil and rock [5,6]. For this reason, they are typically used
when forest residues are indiscriminantly piled. Conversely, the
knives used in drum or disc chippers are sensitive to rock
contamination [7,8] and are more efﬁcient comminuting material
homogenous in size, such as stem wood rather than branches [9,10]
and would therefore require the separation of residues [11]. The
primary advantage of chipping stem wood compared to grinding
unsorted residues is a higher quality feedstock with a more uniform
particle size distribution [12]. Processing (i.e., delimbing stems)
sorted forest residue stems prior to chipping has been shown to
further improve the quality of feedstock produced by reducing ash
content and reducing the amount of over- and under-sized particles
[12].
In addition to producing uniform feedstock, chippers can also be
conﬁgured to produce different size wood chips. Small chips have a
greater bulk density compared to larger chips [13] which has a
direct effect on feedstock storage, transportation costs [14], and
biomass conversion processes [15]. For example, producing small
chips can increase a feedstock's shipping density resulting in an
increase of transportation efﬁciency and a reduction in cost [16].
The ability to produce smaller sized particles (<4.0 mm in
length) is also important to consider when providing a feedstock
for biomass conversion technologies. Feedstock size has been
shown to inﬂuence extrusion and pyrolysis processes by having an
effect on binding, drying, and reaction time [17e19]. A feedstock's

geometric mean length, width, and thickness, as well as uniformity
directly affects conversion efﬁciency, product quality, and dura-
bility. Densiﬁcation technology was found to be more effective in
producing a higher quality (i.e., durable and dense) product [20]
when using small sized feedstock, compared to briquettes and
pellets produced from larger chips [21,22]. A different study had
agreed
that
blending
a
10e20%
feedstock
of
ﬁne
particles
(<4.76 mm) would improve densiﬁcation quality due to interpar-
ticle bonding [19].
Biomass gasiﬁcation, a technology often used to produce gas
and generate electrical energy, can be sensitive to particle size
[23,24]. When feedstock particles ranging from 0.13 to 0.30 mm in
size were pyrolyzed at a temperature between 500 and 900 C,
there was a greater production output and quality of biogas [23,25].
In addition, the conversion of biomass with larger (>2.0 mm) par-
ticle size resulted in a slower gas diffusion speed and lower quality
gas [23,26].
Torrefaction is a thermochemical process using temperatures
ranging between 200 and 300
C [26,27] to convert organic
biomass into a charcoal-like material, which has better fuel char-
acteristics than the original biomass. There are a number of studies
that have examined the effect of reaction temperature and reactor
residence time on the torrefaction process [28,29,30], but only a
few studies have been performed on the effect particle size has on
torrefaction. Basu et al. [30] evaluated the effect of seven different
feedstock sizes on a torrefaction process, observing that energy and
mass yield produced more when the smaller size (4.76 mm in
diameter) torreﬁed at 250 C. However, Peng et al. [31] investigated
the effect of three particles sizes (0.23, 0.67, and 0.81 mm), ﬁnding
that as the size of a particle decreased, the weight loss rate
increased, but the energy yield decreased during the torrefaction
process.
The ability to control particle size when chipping can be chal-
lenging. Aside form machine type and conﬁguration, there are a
number of factors such as moisture content, wood hardness and
strength, and annual growth ring characteristics [32,33]. Suadicani
and Gamborg [34] investigated the effect of different moisture
content (60 vs. 40%). They found that freshly felled whole trees with
a 60% moisture content produced a greater proportion of ﬁne chips
and less over-sized chips compared to whole trees with a lower
moisture content. In a study by Watson and Stevenson [35], logs
with low moisture content increased the over-sized chip and
decreased the amount of ﬁne particles. Particularly, woody biomass
with either low and high moisture content produced chips with a
greater proportion of over-sized and ﬁne particle sizes [32,36,37]
because moisture content inﬂuences wood strength [32].
Current research on a producing small sized wood chips or
microchips (<10 mm) is very limited. Past studies have reported
micro-chipper's productivity and feedstock quality when produc-
ing 6e10 mm chips in diameter [12,38]. However, producing chips
smaller than 4 mm using a sawdust machine is largely unknown.
In this study, we evaluated the productivity and cost of a 294-
kW (400-hp) track mounted sawdust machine to determine its
capabilities when comminuting forest residues to produce sawdust
sized (2e4 mm) chips as feedstock for biomass conversion. The
primary objective was to determine the effect material type and
diameter had on the performance of the sawdust machine. In
addition, we evaluated the quality of feedstock produced during the
tests. More speciﬁcally, we analyzed moisture content, particle size
distribution, and bulk density of feedstocks produced from four
different material types: small (<15 cm) and large (15e30 cm)
diameter processed hardwood (LH and SH, respectively) and soft-
wood (SS and LS, respectively). As a precaution, we took steps to
evaluate the potential confounding inﬂuence of knife wear. During
the operation, knives were not changed. Therefore, prior to
changing to a new material, we tested for possible knife wear by
comminuting a control material, i.e., 0.1 m  0.1 m  2.4 m
Douglas-ﬁr boards, and evaluated any change in particle size and or
production rate. Conclusions from this study will be valuable to
managers who face the challenges of meeting smaller sized woody
biomass feedstock speciﬁcations required by different conversion
technologies. Information from this study will also allow managers
to compare the performance and cost of this machine with other
options when comminuting forest residues.
2. Methods and materials
2.1. Description of material types and sawdust machine used in the
experiment
The study site was located in Humboldt County, northern Cali-
fornia in a harvested unit on Green Diamond Resource Company
timberland. The harvested stand was second growth mixed-conifer
stand composed of redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), Douglas-ﬁr
(Pseudotsuga menzesii), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), and
tanoak (Notholithcarpus densiﬂorus). The unit was clear-cut using a
feller-buncher. Whole trees were shovel logged to roadside or
landings. A dangle-head processor (John Deere 2454D with a
Waratah 623 processing head) delimbed, bucked, sorted and piled
approximately 80 green metric tons (GmT) of four different mate-
rial types: small-diameter softwood stems (SS; < 20 cm); large-
diameter softwood stems (LS; 20e30 cm); small-diameter hard-
wood stems (SH; < 20 cm); and large-diameter hardwood stems
(LH; 20e30 cm). Slash piles were commonly composed of pro-
cessed and sorted stems in the 15e30 cm diameter range in
preparation for transportation to a biomass conversion technology
[12,39] particularly in Northern California. Stem wood used for this
study were processed to a 6e7 m length to facilitate handling and
to control the inﬂuence of stem length on comminution produc-
tivity [12].
The track-based sawdust machine used in this study was a
prototype model manufactured with a 294-kW Doosan diesel en-
gine which powered a 1.2 m (height) by 0.8 m (diameter) concave
drum equipped with an array of 582 tungsten alloy knives desinged
to produce sawdust size (2e4 mm) (Fig. 1). At the beginning of the
experiment new knives were installed. The machine was equipped
with four free-spinning rollers that positioned stem wood material
onto a metal-toothed in-feed conveyor belt that pulled the material
toward the chipping drum. The machine was designed with an
additional metal toothed conveyor above and at an angle to provide
a downward pressure on material entering the 0.4 m by 0.7 m in-
feed mouth. The conveyor was controlled by the operator who
could select between the belt moving towards or away from the
chipping drum. Wood sawdust exiting the chipping chamber was
blown onto a 2.5 m by 0.7 m rubber conveyor belt. The sawdust
machine was positioned on a large landing with a tracked loader
using standard log grapples and a roll-off bin truck equipped with a
15 m3 bin (see Fig. 2).
2.2. Field data collection
Prior to chipping, the four material types were characterized by
stem size (Table 1). Average stem volume was calculated using the
Smalian's formula for each material type [40]. Standard time and
motion study methods were used to evaluate machine productivity
[41]. A production cycle was deﬁned as the time necessary to chip a
single stem. Because the machine's engine had difﬁculty main-
taining drum speed when chipping a large number of stems at a
time. The cycle started when the processed stem made contact with
the chipping drum, which was audibly discernable, and ended

54

when the chipping sound stopped. All other times were recorded as
delays in the operation. During the experiment, three 15 m3 bins
were ﬁlled with sawdust from a single material type for each ma-
terial type (i.e., SS, LS, SH, and LH). The total amount of time to ﬁll a
bin (beginning with the ﬁrst cycle to the end of the last cycle) was
recorded. To determine the machine rate, pure chipping and delay
times sum up to gross-cycle times and refer to scheduled machine
hours (SMH). Thus, machine rate was pure chipping times per day
divided by the scheduled machine hours per day.
Loaded bin weights were measured by driving the roll-off bin
truck onto a PT300™RFX portable wheel-load scale installed on-
site. The scale, which is capable of weighing up to 20 tonnes, is
accurate to within ±1% of the reading. Standard methods were used
to calculate hourly machine cost for the sawdust machine and as-
sumptions are listed in Table 2 [42].
Sawdust samples were collected during the operation for lab
analysis of feedstock quality. An 8.8-L bucket was held under the
sawdust machine's discharge conveyor belt to collect samples. A
single sample, equaling approximately two bucket loads, was
collected every three or 4 min until 10 samples were collected for
each material type of SH, LH, SS, and LS. Every sample was placed in
plastic trash bags and marked with a sample number. A 3.8-L
subsample was taken from each sample to assess moisture con-
tent. Each subsample was immediately weighed in the ﬁeld with a
portable scale to record green weight.
The fuel consumed during each material type test was measured
by recording the amount of fuel needed to reﬁll the tank to a pre-
marked level on a fuel sight gauge. A 1000 ml graduated cylinder
was used to measure [43,44]. From this data, we calculated liters of
fuel consumed per hour and applied this to the cost formula.
For this study we chose to test the effect of knife wear by
comminuting a control material, 0.1 m  0.1 m  2.4 m Douglas-ﬁr
boards. Control materials were chipped before and after each new
material type. Sawdust samples were collected the same way SH,
LH, SS, and LS test samples were collected. Particle size of chips
created from these boards to see if there was any change over time,

possibly indicating knife wear.
2.3. Lab work and data analysis
In total, 110 samples (Table 3) were put into paper bags and
oven-dried at 105 C for 48 h. The moisture content of each sawdust
sample was determined by following the ASTM D4442-07 method
[45].
The particle size distribution of sawdust samples produced
during the experiment was determined by ASTM E11-16 standard
[46]. A 2.5-L subsample was removed from each sample and
separated into seven size-classes (<0.84 mm, 0.84e1.00 mm,
1.00e1.41 mm, 1.41e2.00 mm, 2.00e2.80 mm, 2.80e4.00 mm, and
>4.00 mm) using a mechanical sieve shaker including six sieves
and a bottom pan. After screening, the material captured in each
sieve was weighed. The mass of each sieve was used to determine
the percentage of total mass to get a size distribution of sawdust.
We also calculated the geometric mean particle size using equa-
tions which adopted from a method used to express particle size of
chopped forage material by screening [47].
The bulk density of each sample was determined using a
modiﬁed version of ISO 15103 [48]. In our analysis, we used an 8.8-L
bucket to conduct two tap tests for each sample. The test was
repeated if the two bulk density results differed by more than 5%.
The study data was analyzed using SPSS Statistics software [49].
Statistical methods included homogeneity of variance tests (Lev-
ene's test). Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used for checking the
equality of means, obtained at the different treatments. Post-hoc
tests were carried out according to the Scheffe's test (parametric)
or the Dunnett's T3 test (non-parametric). For example, when the
Levene's P-value was smaller than 0.05, the Dunnett's T3 test was
used. Pearson's correlation tests were used to determine the rela-
tionship between moisture content, geometric mean particle size,
and bulk density. A 5% alpha level was the signiﬁcance criteria used
for statistical tests.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Productivity and cost of converting stem wood into sawdust
size chips
The study was designed to test the sawdust machine while
comminuting four different material types. However, the machine's
298-kW motor had difﬁculty maintaining drum speed when
chipping the LH, leading to prolonged delays and occasional ma-
chine malfunction. For this reason, we excluded LH from the study
and focused on the three other material types.
On average, the machine was capable of producing 18.3 to 26.7
BDmT of sawdust/PMH at a cost of US $5.3 and US $3.6/BDmT,
respectively (Table 1). Despite having longer average delay free
cycle time, the production rate for LS was signiﬁcantly greater (25%)
compared to the SS and SH (P < 0.05) by one-way ANOVA and
Scheffe's test. Greater production when comminuting LS was
mainly due to larger stem volume, which was two times greater
than SS and SH.
During the comminution process, average fuel consumption
varied between 26 and 29 L/SMH. There was no signiﬁcant effect of
material types (P > 0.05) by one-way ANOVA and Scheffe's test. Nati
et al. [44] found that material type had no effect on fuel con-
sumption but rather it was the mechanism of comminution (i.e.,
drum vs. disc) had a greater inﬂuence. Thus, LS conﬁguration pro-
duced a much larger quanty of sawdust while the same amount of
fuel consumption.
We found that diameter size had a considerable impact on
chipping time (P < 0.001). Stem diameter size and comminuting
time were directly related (R2 > 0.40). Thus, stem diameter size was
a signiﬁcant variable in this study.
During the study, we noticed that the productivity of the proto-
type sawdust machine was inﬂuenced by material conveyance and
motor size. The in-feed conveyor belt, which used metal teeth to pull
the material into the drum, would often fail to maintain a grip on the
stem. This required the loader to assist feeding the sawdust machine
reducing productivity. The percentage of delaysfrominfeed issues in
this case study was 50%. When the material began chipping, espe-
cially for larger stems, the resistance on the chipper's drum would
overpower the motor. The drum's rotation speed without a load was
2000 revolutions per minute (RPM). When chipping, it would drop

as the motor was put under stress to maintain drum RPMs. When the
drum RPMs would drop below 1500 the operator would reverse the
in-feed belt and allowed theRPMs toregain speed. The time required
to regain optimal drum speed accounted for 7, 8, and 13% of total
work cycle time for the SS, SH, LS tests, respectively. One technique
used to alleviate this, was to back the material out of the chipper
before the drum's RPM dropped below a critical point. This method
reduced the time needed to bring the drum up to speed. For this
reason, we feel that the sawdust machine could improve its pro-
ductivity by using a larger motor. Further, size recustion equipment
(i.e., chipper and grinder) engine power was commonly used to
between 570-kWand 782-kW machines [5,12,50,51], particularly in
Northern California.
Compared to other chippers, the sawdust machine's chipping
productivity was lower. For example, a Peterson Paciﬁc 4300B, 570-
kW micro-chipper was reported chipping processed softwood and
hardwood stems, averaging 0.18 m3 in log volume with 20% mois-
ture content, at a rate of 33.9 BDmT/PMH and an estimated cost of
US $11.2/BDmT [12]. We can attribute the difference in productivity
to engine power which was also observed in Spinelli and Hartsough
study [52]. The authors found a chipping productivity was inversely
associated to engine power.
3.2. Quality of sawdust produced during the study
3.2.1. Moisture content of sawdust
The average moisture content of the sawdust sampled from the
three material types chipped in this study ranged between 26 and
36% (Table 1). The materials prepared for this study were residues
left from a logging operation that occurred in June of 2016, one
month prior to chipping. LS was the only material type that was
signiﬁcantly different in mean moisture content (36%) compared to
SS (26%) and SH (29%) by Dunnett's T3 post-hoc test (LS vs. SS and
SH, P < 0.001). Several studies have reported that moisture content
had an inverse relationship on the size of the particle produced
[32,33,35,37]. In our study, however, the moisture content had a
weak to moderate negative correlation and no pattern with geo-
metric mean particle length (Fig. 3). When stem moisture content
was fresh, the chips were less homogeneous compared to particles
with 18e25% moisture content [35,36].
3.2.2. Particle size distribution of sawdust
The geometric mean particle length of sawdust sampled from
the three material types (SH, SS, and LS) were 4.7 ± 0.1, 5.3 ± 0.1,
and 4.4 ± 0.1 mm, respectively (Fig. 4). There was a signiﬁcant
difference between geometric means of the different treatments
(F(3,16) ¼ 31.6274, P < 0.001) by one-way ANOVA and Scheffe's test.
The data analysis results of the sawdust size distribution are shown
in Figs. 5 and 6. The size class with the greatest proportion, ranging
between 74 and 84%, were between 0.84 and 4.00 mm, depending
on material type. The LS test produced the greatest proportion of
acceptable particle size (84%) compared to SS and SH. Over-sized
particles (greater than 4.00 mm) were signiﬁcantly more frequent
in the SS tests (P < 0.001). The percentage of ﬁne particles (less than
0.84 mm) was higher in SH test than in other tests (P < 0.05) (see
Fig. 6).
There are two main factors that inﬂuenced particle size: physical
characteristics of the material (e.g., shape, density, and moisture
content)
[5,12,35,37,47,51]
and
machine
characteristics
(e.g.,
chipper type, knife sharpness and angle, and rotation speed)
[49,52,53]. In this study, the goal was to control for as many of these
factors as possible to reduce the effect of confounding variables.
One interesting phenomenon we observed was the relationship
between the material and the machine. The density of the SH and
the larger volume of the LS created stress on the 294-kW motor.
The resistance exerted by the material reduced drum speed and
may have had an effect on the particle size. Two studies, Hoque
et al. [54] and Hernandez and Jacques [55] both found that chipper
engine power inﬂuenced chip piece size. More speciﬁcally, higher
chipper rotating speeds produced a greater percentage of small size
chips. Results from this study are similar ﬁndings. The ratio of
particles less than 0.84 mm in size increased with the SH and LS
tests. Both of these material types chipped at a faster rate indicating
that drum rotation speed was not reduced during the operation.
Watson and Stevenson [35] and Van der Merwe et al. [53] found
that over-sized chip production declined 3e10% with an increase in
stem diameter and moisture content. Other study conﬁrmed pre-
vious ﬁnding about the primary effect of stem diameter size on
moisture content [56]. Therefore, interactions between respective
stem's diameter and moisture content had an effect on feedstock
size distribution during chipping process. Similar results were
found in our study. The LS test produced 12% fewer particles greater
than 4.00 mm compared to SS.
3.2.3. Bulk density of sawdust
The packing density of the chips produced in this study ranged
between 233 and 281 kg/m3 on a wet basis. The moisture content of
chips did not have an inﬂuence on bulk density when conducting a
tap tests [57]. Dunnett's T3 post-hoc test indicated that SS was the
only material type that was signiﬁcantly different with the lowest
Fig. 3. Moisture content, which was calculated using dry oven method, of small
diameter hardwood (SH), small diameter softwood (SS), and large diameter softwood
(LS) sawdust samples and their relationship with geometric mean particle size. The
moisture content had a moderate correlation with geometric mean particle length on
SH (R ¼ 0.43, n ¼ 30) and SS (R ¼ 0.48, n ¼ 30) trial tests and no pattern correlation
in LS (R ¼ 0.05, n ¼ 30) trial by Pearson's correlation tests.

value in mean bulk density compared to other material types
(P < 0.001). The bulk density of small size chips increased 20% in
comparison with the larger sized chips [12].
The mean bulk density of the sawdust evaluated showed a
similar pattern of those reported for a micro-chipping study where
hardwood chips had a greater bulk density compared to softwood
[10]. The difference between species was attributed to the
difference in the speciﬁc gravity between hardwood (tanoak, 0.58)
and softwood (Douglas-ﬁr, 0.45) [58].
3.2.4. Knife wear during comminution tests
Knife wear has shown to be a factor contributing to particle size
distribution [59,60], therefore a new set of knifes should have been
installed after each material type test. However, due to high cost to

replace a set of knives, the effect of knife wear on sawdust quality
and sawdust machine productivity was evaluated by monitoring
changes in a uniform or “control” material type.
The geometric mean length of particles produced from the
chipped Douglas-ﬁr boards were 6.2 mm when working with new
knife condition. Geometric mean of the different conditions (after
SH test, SS test, and LS test) were 5.9, 6.1, and 6.5 mm, respectively.
ANOVA showed that there were no signiﬁcant differences between
the particle size of different control tests (P ¼ 0.341, Fig. 7).
Futhermore, average comminuting time (3.1 ± 0.1 s) was statisti-
cally the same (P > 0.05).
The decision to evaluate knife wear was determined by the
availability and cost of replacement knives in this study. During the
experiment, we chipped almost 60 GmT of stem-wood which var-
ied in size, density, and moisture content. The manufacturer
explained how tungsten alloy knives would stay sharp for
approximately 1000 h of operation before needing a resharpen [61].
Thus, with the small number of operating hours (<20 h), we
believed that there was no signiﬁcant effect of knife sharpness on
productivity, cost, and feedstock quality of sawdust during the
comminution process.
4. Conclusion
Particle size is an important feedstock characteristic to consider
when providing feedstock for biomass conversion processes such as
densiﬁcation,
gasiﬁcation,
and
torrefaction.
In
this
study,
a
controlled experiment was performed to evaluate the effect three
different material types (small-diameter processed hardwood and
softwood, and large-diameter processed softwood) had on a 298-
kW sawdust machine's productivity. Feedstock quality, measured
by moisture content, particle size, and bulk density, were also
characterized.
The average productivity when chipping processed forest resi-
dues with this machine was 21.6 BDmT/PMH at a cost of US $4.6/
BDmT. Small softwood materials had a 10% higher chipping pro-
ductivity than small hardwood. Moisture content also had an in-
ﬂuence on the geometric mean particle size of sawdust because
moisture
content
inﬂuences
mechanical
stem
hardness
and
strength. Sawdust size increased when material moisture content
decreased. The geometric mean particle lengths of chips produced
in the study were signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the different stem
diameter. The bulk density has been found to not have an impact on
moisture content.
Knife wear, which was considered a potential confounding
variable in the study, was not a signiﬁcant factor inﬂuencing pro-
ductivity, cost, and feedstock quality in this limited duration trial. In
other words, the sharpness of the tungsten alloy knives did not
noticeably change the particle size of chips after comminuting
60 GmT of stem wood at a 30% moisture content.
This study's ﬁndings have shown that this track-based sawdust
machine can be a cost effective option if you are interested in
producing small chips like sawdust. Converting stem wood into
sawdust like chips using a mobile machine can effectively support
the efforts of converting forest biomass into biobased products such
as briquets, wood pellets, and torreﬁed wood chips as well as
composting materials. Further research is need to compare the
unique mobile chipper with a 294-kW (400-hp) with a 441-kW
(600-hp) engine to ﬁnd the productivity and feedstock quality
from various wood material types.
