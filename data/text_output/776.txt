Hart Prairie, Arizona, has the largest Bebb willow (Salix bebbiana) community in the
United States; however, greater than 95% of willows are older than 80 years and
regeneration by seed is not occurring. This study examined the evapotranspiration of two
herbaceous communities that dominate the Hart Prairie watershed: (1) a mixture of
bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum) and graminoids and (2) dominantly graminoids.
Transpiration during premonsoon and postmonsoon dry periods of 2000, 2001, and
2002 was estimated for each community by the difference in volumetric soil-water content
(0–30 cm soil depth) between replicated plots that were clipped of all vegetation and
control, unclipped plots. Transpiration rates estimated under conditions of minimal soil
drainage varied between 0.63 and 2.4 mm/d for the fern-graminoid community and
0.57 and 1.1 mm/d for the graminoid community over the study. The fern-graminoid
community produced more biomass than the graminoid community in all years, but
generally had lower transpiration rates. Severe drought in year 2002 reduced growth and
transpiration of the fern-graminoid community more than the graminoid community.
Evaporation rates were estimated by temporal changes in soil-water content in clipped
plots during dry periods, and were 54 to 474% of transpiration rates estimated under
conditions of minimal soil drainage because of the dry and windy conditions that occur at
the study site. Based on this study and a study of transpiration of scattered trees
invading the meadow, transpiration by the herbaceous understory was higher than
transpiration by trees during similar seasons.

Introduction
[2] Dense herbaceous vegetation in the arid western
United States can influence water recharge into deep soil
and groundwater [Bosch and Hewlett, 1982; Huxman et al.,
2005]. For example, removal of grass in a Colorado prairie
allowed soil water in the upper layers to infiltrate deeper
into the soil [Dodd et al., 1998]. Soil-water storage at three
sites in the arid western United States (Beatty, NV, Las
Cruces, NM, and Hanford, WA) was lower in vegetated
versus unvegetated sites [Gee et al., 1994]. Water use by
bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum), a common component
of the herbaceous understory in our study, can be about half
of total forest transpiration (T) under hot, dry conditions
[Tan and Black, 1976; Roberts et al., 1980]. Current
proposals for watershed restoration in some southwestern
U.S. forests are based on the assumption that tree thinning
will reduce evapotranspiration (ET) and consequently
increase runoff and groundwater recharge [Covington and
Moore, 1994]. However, high transpiration rates of the
herbaceous understory may reduce effects of tree thinning
on runoff and recharge.
[3] The purpose of this study was to estimate evapotrans-
piration of the herbaceous understory of Hart Prairie, a high-
elevation wet meadow in a semiarid western U.S.
watershed. Understanding the water balance of Hart Prairie
is important because it supports a rare riparian community
of Bebb willow (Salix bebbiana) that is not regenerating by
seed, likely because of low soil-water availability [DeWald
and Springer, 2001]. Hart Prairie is an important Bebb
willow community because it is thought to be the largest
such community in the United States [Waring, 1992a,
1992b] and is located at the southern extent of the species
range [Kearney and Peebles, 1951]. Most Bebb willow at
Hart Prairie are older than 80 years and young willow are
sparse [Waring, 1992a, 1992b; DeWald and Springer,
2001]. Factors suggested to limit willow regeneration in-
clude heavy herbivory from elk and deer, competition from
herbaceous vegetation and encroaching pines, low soil-
water availability, and lack of high stream flows [DeWald
and Springer, 2001]. DeWald and Springer [2001] hypoth-
esized that drought, surface-water diversions, and high
water use by herbaceous plants and the upslope coniferous
forest have reduced water availability to the Bebb willow
community and may limit willow regeneration by seed.

year of measurement, and season of measurement. We
hypothesized that transpiration of the herbaceous understory
was lower than the transpiration of a low density pine forest
which was encroaching onto the wet meadow. Watershed
runoff studies suggest that encroachment by woody vege-
tation into grasslands often increases evapotranspiration,
with the largest increases occurring in more humid and
mesic environments [Bosch and Hewlett, 1982; Zhang et
al., 2001]. However, the effect of woody encroachment on
evapotranspiration in more arid environments is less clear,
with the direction and magnitude of the effect depending on
interactions among characteristics of vegetation, landscape,
and climate [Huxman et al., 2005]. Based on previous
watershed studies, we hypothesized that growing-season
transpiration rate of the herbaceous understory would be
lower than transpiration rate of the pine forest that has
encroached into Hart Prairie. The low-density stand (aver-
age of 16 trees/ha) of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and
limber pine (Pinus flexilis) that has encroached into Hart
Prairie upstream of the Bebb willow community had a 60-
day growing-season stand transpiration between 3.5 mm
and 14.2 mm in 2000 based on tree sapflow scaled to the
stand level [Fischer, 2001; Fischer et al., 2002]. However,
transpiration of the herbaceous understory had not previ-
ously been measured.

Study Site
[5] Hart Prairie is located 24 km northwest of Flagstaff,
Arizona (35220N, 111450W, Figure 1) on the west side of
San Francisco Mountain in the U.S. Forest Service Fern
Mountain Botanical Area and in The Nature Conservancy
Hart Prairie Preserve. It covers an area of 101 ha between
elevations of 2570 m and 2743 m. Humphreys Peak is the
highest elevation in Arizona (3850 m) and the top of the
Hart Prairie watershed. The Hart Prairie watershed dis-
charges through Hart Creek, at the base of Fern Mountain
(Figure 1). Hart Creek flows into Volunteer Wash, which is
a tributary of the Verde River. The area of the Hart Creek
watershed is 12 km2 [Gavin, 1998].
[6] Hart Prairie is an upland riparian area dominated by
Bebb willow, trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), and

mixed graminoid communities [DeWald and Springer,
2001]. These aspen and Bebb willow communities are
important for biodiversity and wildlife habitat [Naiman et
al., 1993; DeWald and Springer, 2001]. Other trees present
in the willow community at Hart Prairie are ponderosa pine,
limber pine, and Englemann spruce (Picea engelmannii).
The understory consists of meadow grasses and forbs such
as bracken fern, Kentucky blue grass (Poa pratensis),
Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica), and silver lupine
(Lupinus argenteus). A survey of plant species in both
communities performed in late September 2000 (n = 6,
1 m  0.25 m plots per community [Amentt, 2002]) showed
that the fern-graminoid community included about 15
herbaceous species, and cover was dominated by
bracken fern, Kentucky bluegrass, and nodding brome
(Bromus anomalus) (Table 1). All dominant species in the
fern-graminoid community have the C3 photosynthetic
pathway. The graminoid community was more diverse, with
about 25 herbaceous species, and cover was dominated by
Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica)(C3 pathway) and moun-
tain muhly (Muhlenbergia montana)(C4 pathway) (Table 1).
[7] The hydrogeology of Hart Prairie consists of small-
perched aquifers. Highly permeable alluvial and colluvial
deposits derived from volcanic parent materials are common
[Dewitt, 1980; Gavin, 1998]. The western slope of San
Francisco Mountain has accumulated thick colluvial depos-
its from the different stages of volcanism of San Francisco
Mountain [Robinson, 1913; Updike and Pewe, 1970; Holm,
1986]. Clay lenses in the alluvial and colluvial deposits
allow thin, ephemeral, and discontinuous perched aquifers
to form [Dewitt, 1980]. Recharge from these small perched
aquifers is directly related to the annual amount of snow and
rain. Because storage in these perched aquifers is greatly
diminished in dry years, recharge must happen frequently
[Dewitt, 1980]. Snowmelt is the primary source of recharge
for Hart Prairie, but heavy monsoon season rains in late
summer can also provide limited recharge to some of the
small-perched aquifers in Hart Prairie. Robinson [1913]
noted that springs were the most reliable water source in
the San Francisco Volcanic Field. The sources for these
springs are shallow, small-perched aquifers, because the
regional aquifer in the Coconino Sandstone and Supai
Formation is at least 1000 m below land surface [Gavin,
1998].
[8] The volcanic rocks in the area are primarily basalt
[Holm, 1988]. Debris flows from San Francisco Mountain
comprise the colluvial deposits that underlie Hart Prairie
[Holm, 1988]. Soils in Hart Prairie are classified as loamy-
skeletal, mixed, frigid Argiaquoll, and a fine-loamy, mixed
Aquic Argiboroll [Gavin, 1998]. The Argiaquoll, very
cobbly loam to very cobbly clay loam soils contain up to
50% clay and are primarily located around the springs. The
majority of the soils are classified as Argiborolls, and are
characterized by an over-thickened mollic epipedon. The
fern-graminoid and graminoid plots have a saturated
hydraulic conductivity of 1.2  103 cm/s and 6.1 
104 cm/s and a field capacity of approximately 30% and
26%, respectively [Amentt, 2002].
[9] The climate of Hart Prairie is semiarid. The closest
meteorological station is Fort Valley, Arizona, 330 m
lower in elevation
and 13 km away
(35160N,
111440W). The monthly average temperature at Fort
Valley varies between 3.6C in the winter and 16.9C
in the summer and the mean annual temperature is 6C
(based on 92 years). There are two wet seasons, winter
and summer, and average annual precipitation is 579 mm
(includes water equivalent for snow fall). The majority of
the precipitation comes during the winter as snow, aver-
aging 2167 mm annually (Western Regional Climate
Center, http://www.wrcc.dri.edu). The ‘‘monsoon’’ show-
ers come between late June and September. The driest
months of the year are late April to mid June and late
August to October.

Precipitation
[10] Precipitation at Hart Prairie was measured (accuracy
± 0.13 mm) with a Rain Wise model RGEL Electronic
Recording tipping bucket and accompanying data logger
(Rain Wise, Inc., Bar Harbor, ME) at an elevation of 2810 m
at the upper end of Hart Prairie (Figure 1). The bucket was
equipped with a heating blanket that melted snow in the
winter to allow measurement of snowfall in water equiv-
alents. Also, historic yearly precipitation totals were esti-
mated for Hart Prairie based on linear regression (r2 = 0.79)
between empirically measured yearly precipitation at Hart
Prairie and yearly precipitation measured at the Fort Valley

Groundwater Levels
[11] Groundwater levels were measured in many shallow
wells in the Hart Prairie area, but water levels from a 1.5-m
deep well at the weather tower (Figure 1) were used to
represent groundwater conditions at the adjacent herbaceous
study plots. Water levels in the well were measured with a
chalked, etched steel tape with an accuracy of ±0.15 cm
about every two weeks during the growing season and
monthly during the winter.
3.3.
Herbaceous Transpiration
[12] Herbaceous communities inhabiting Hart Prairie vary
spatially depending on water availability and elevation. In
the wetter areas and lower elevations, bracken fern and
several graminoid species dominate the herbaceous commu-
nity. Upslope and in drier areas, the understory is dominated
by graminoids with no ferns (Table 1). The same experiment
was performed in the mixed bracken fern-graminoid com-
munity and in the graminoid community (Figure 1).
[13] We estimated transpiration from each herbaceous
community by comparing volumetric soil-water content (q)
between paired plots that differed in aboveground herbaceous
vegetation (present or absent). This approach has been used
successfully to measure transpiration by short-grass prairie in
Colorado [Dodd et al., 1998]. Five blocks were randomly
established in each community on a 7 slope. Each block
contained two circular plots (1.7 m radius); one was used as
the unclipped, control and the second plot was clipped. All
aboveground herbaceous vegetation in the clipped plots was
removed weekly between May and September of each year
by hand clippers and with a gas-powered weed cutter.
Clipped biomass was left on the soil surface to mimic the
cover of the unclipped plots. After the first year of the study,
there was little vegetation to clip in the clipped plots.
3.4.
Soil Water
[14] Volumetric soil-water content was measured weekly
with a Moisture Point MP-917 time-domain reflectometry
system (Environmental Sensors, Inc., Vancouver, BC). This
instrument has a measurement range between 10% and 90%
q with an accuracy of ±3% in most soil conditions without
calibration. Measurements were made weekly in each plot
between May and September of 2000, 2001, and 2002.
Thirty-centimeter probes were used because they extended
below the rooting depth of most of the herbaceous vegeta-
tion, as indicated by the absence of roots below this depth in
several hand-dug holes, but remained in the thick B horizon
of the soils. Two pairs of 30 cm probes were inserted in
the ground near the center of each plot to decrease influences
of water uptake from outside the plot. All plots were located
at least 20 m from trees to eliminate influences of water
uptake by trees. Limited data suggest that lateral roots of
ponderosa pine extend to a maximum of about 40 times the
diameter of the tree at breast height [Curtis, 1964].
Measurements of q at two locations within each plot
were averaged for each plot.
3.5.
Herbaceous Biomass
[15] Aboveground biomass was sampled near the end of
the growing season when biomass peaked (October 2, 2000,
September 20, 2001, September 25, 2002). All living
aboveground vegetation was collected from a 0.43-m2 area
adjacent to each block in each of the two vegetation
communities (Figure 1). The vegetation was dried at 70
C for 24 hours prior to weighing.
3.6.
Analysis
[16] Transpiration (T) was estimated for each herbaceous
community type by comparing the differences in q between
the unclipped and clipped plots during distinct drying
periods when there was no precipitation. Two such periods
occurred in each year (2000, 2001, and 2002) of the study:
late April to mid June (premonsoon dry period), and late
August to late September (postmonsoon dry period). Al-
though analysis of hydrographs from groundwater wells in
Hart Prairie suggests that no recharge to the aquifer or
possible lateral flow occurred during these dry periods,
there may have been a drainage when q exceeded the field
capacity. Evaporation (E) was measured for the clipped
plots and E and T for the unclipped plots. The mean
difference in q between the unclipped and clipped plots at
the end of each dry-down period was used to estimate T
during each dry-down period. We could not estimate T
during the rainy monsoon season (mid June to August)
with this method because some precipitation may have
drained below 30 cm in the soil and flowed laterally.
Volumetric soil-water content was converted to depth in
centimeters to determine T and to compare it to precip-
itation. Evaporation rates were estimated by the temporal
change in q during periods of no precipitation (premon-
soon and postmonsoon dry periods) in the clipped plots
by linear regression of q on day of the year. Drainage
rates were estimated using Clapp and Hornberger [1978].
[17] Estimates of herbaceous T during the premonsoon
and postmonsoon dry periods were compared with potential
evapotranspiration (PET) estimated by the Hamon [1963]
method. Hamon [1963] is a reference surface PET method
which uses an empirical function of the day length and the
saturation vapor pressure at the mean daily temperature. A
recent comparison of potential evapotranspiration functions
showed that the Hamon method had the lowest mean annual
error and the smallest bias over a gradient of aridity of five
reference-surface methods [Vorosmarty et al., 1998]. PET
rates with the Hamon [1963] method were calculated for the
premonsoon and postmonsoon dry periods to be directly
comparable with the dry-down periods used to calculate the
herbaceous E and T rates.
[18] Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was calculated for each
premonsoon and postmonsoon drydown period from mean
daytime (8:00 to 17:00) air temperature and dew point
temperature at the Flagstaff, Arizona, recording station at
Pulliam Airport (the nearest uninterrupted, complete data
set). Vapor pressure deficit was calculated to be the differ-
ence between the mean saturated vapor pressure of the mean
daytime temperature during the drydown period, minus the
vapor pressure at the mean daily dew point temperature
[Murray, 1967].
[19] Volumetric soil-water content data were analyzed
with multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with
repeated measures using SAS JMP 4 software (SAS Insti-
tute, Inc., Cary, NC). We analyzed the data separately by
year. Measurement date within the year was the repeated

factor. Sources of variation in the MANOVA for each year
were: community type, treatment, block, and the commu-
nity x treatment interaction. The effect of measurement date
could not be tested directly due to limitations of the degrees
of freedom that can occur when the number of levels of the
repeated factor greatly exceeds the number of replications.
Biomass data were analyzed with ANOVA using SAS JMP
4 (SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, NC). The sources of variation
were year, community, block, and the community x year
interaction. Mean separations of the biomass data were
performed with Duncan’s New Multiple Range test at p =
0.05.

Results
4.1.
Precipitation
[20] Total precipitation measured in Hart Prairie be-
tween October 1999 and September 2000 (the year
2000 water year) was 293 mm, 51% of the average
annual precipitation of 569 mm/yr based on a 92 yr
record at the nearby Fort Valley Climate Center, AZ. The
monsoon season began on June 19, 2000 (Figure 2c).
Total precipitation between October 2000 and September
2001 was 440 mm, 77% of annual average precipitation,
but not as low as 2000. The monsoon season began on
June 20, 2001 (Figure 3c). Rain showers were more
frequent in 2001 compared to 2000 (Figures 2c and 3c).
Total precipitation between October 2001 and September
2002 was 206 mm (36% annual average), the lowest of
all years included in the study and one of the driest on
record for the region. During the last year of the study,
the monsoon began the latest of the three years, July 9,
2002 (Figure 4c).
4.2.
Groundwater Levels and Drainage
[21] In 2000 and 2001, water levels in the shallow well
were at or near land surface after snow melted in early
spring (Figure 5b). Water levels declined in 2000 and 2001
until the well went dry (>1.5 m depth to water), typically in
June or July. In 2002, the well was dry the entire growing
season. In all years, water levels in the well were below the
depth of q measurements (30 cm) when q measurements
started in April or May (Figures 5a and 5b). Although water
levels were below 30 cm, there likely was some drainage
when q exceeded the field capacity. Drainage was greatest at
the beginning of the drydown periods, especially during
2001, and during the beginning of the postmonsoon dry-
down period each year. We estimated that drainage rates

became significant (>0.5 mm/d) when q > 0.28 in the fern-
graminoid and graminoid plots. These conditions did not
exist for the 2000 or 2002 premonsoon dry-down periods,
but did for the beginning of the 2001 premonsoon, and each
postmonsoon dry-down period.
4.3.
Volumetric Soil-Water Content
4.3.1.
2000 Growing Season
[22] The plots were initially clipped on May 1, 2000, and
q data collection started on May 8, 2000. The growing
season had two distinct dry-down periods: premonsoon
(May 13 to June 19) and postmonsoon (September 2 to
September 22) (Figures 2a and 2b). Temporal variation in q
was similar in both community types (Figures 2a and 2b).
Volumetric soil-water content was high in May and slowly
decreased during June before the monsoon. During the
monsoon, q fluctuated with amount of precipitation, and
then declined after the monsoon ended until late September
when precipitation occurred (Figures 2a and 2b).
[23] In 2000, significant sources of variation in q were
community type and treatment (clipped or unclipped)
(Table 2). Maximum differences in q between treatments
in the first dry-down period (May 13 to June 19) were larger
in the fern-graminoid community (8.8%) (Figure 2a) than in
the graminoid community (4.7%) (Figure 2b). There was a
41% reduction in q between clipped and unclipped fern-
graminoid plots at the end of the premonsoon dry-down
period versus a 17% reduction for the graminoid commu-
nity. This pattern was reversed at the end of the second dry-
down period (September 2 to September 22) where the
graminoid community reduced q by about 46% (Figure 2b)
versus 38% in the fern-graminoid community (Figure 2a).
[24] The fern-graminoid community used 90 mm of water
over 37 days in the pre-monsoon period, or a T rate of
2.4 mm/day (Table 3). Transpiration rate of the fern-grami-
noid community was higher in the post-monsoon season
compared to the premonsoon dry period when 62 mm was
used over 20 days for a T rate of 3.1 mm/day (Table 3).
Transpiration of the fern-graminoid community in the
premonsoon and postmonsoon dry periods combined was
52% of total water-year (October-September) precipitation.
For the fern-graminoid community in 2000, the E rate
ranged from 1.3 mm/day (premonsoon) to 4.0 mm/day
(postmonsoon) (Table 3). PET estimated with the Hamon
method was 2.6 mm/d for the premonsoon dry period and
2.5 mm/d for the postmonsoon dry periods (Table 3). Actual
ET estimated by summing T and E rates (AET) was greater
than PET estimated with the Hamon method by 1.4 fold in
the premonsoon dry period and 2.8 fold in the postmonsoon
dry period (Table 3).
[25] Transpiration of the graminoid community in 2000
for the 37-day premonsoon period was 0.57 mm/day
(Table 3). T of the graminoid community was higher in
the postmonsoon season (5.7 mm/day) compared to the
premonsoon season (Table 3). For the graminoid commu-
nity, E rates ranged from 2.7 mm/day (premonsoon) to
3.0 mm/day (postmonsoon). Actual ET estimated by sum-
ming T and E rates (AET) was greater than PET by 1.2 fold
in the premonsoon dry period and 3.5 fold in the post-
monsoon dry period (Table 3).
4.3.2.
2001 Growing Season
[26] The 2001 results differed from the 2000 results,
probably due to the wetter winter that occurred in 2000–
2001 than in 1999–2000. Volumetric soil-water content
measurements started on May 8, 2001 and ended on
September 25, 2001. The premonsoon dry period lasted
38 days from May 13, 2001, to June 20, 2001 (Figure 3).
The postmonsoon dry period lasted 28 days from August
14, 2001, to September 11, 2001 (Figure 3). In 2001, trends
in q for both herbaceous communities (Figures 3a and 3b)
were similar to 2000 (Figures 2a and 2b). However, the
initial decrease of q in 2001 was greater than in 2000
because q was higher at the beginning of the measurement
period in 2001, and then reached the same low levels at the
end of the premonsoon dry period as in 2000.
[27] In 2001, community, treatment, and the community x
treatment interaction were significant sources of variation in
q (Table 2). The graminoid community (Figure 3b) reduced
q more than the fern-graminoid community (Figure 3a) at
both dry periods. There was a 64% reduction in q between
clipped and unclipped graminoid plots at the end of the
premonsoon dry-down period versus 45% for the fern-

between clipped and unclipped graminoid plots at the end of
the postmonsoon dry-down period versus 27% for the fern-
graminoid community.

[28] Higher precipitation in year 2001 (440 mm) versus
2000 (293 mm) generally resulted in higher q in all
community-treatment combinations in 2001 (Figures 2
and 3). Exceptions to this trend occurred in the fern-
graminoid community where q was lower in the clipped
and unclipped treatments in 2001 than 2000 between late
August and late September (Figures 2a and 3a), and the
graminoid community where q was lower in the unclipped
treatment in 2001 than 2000 between mid July and
September (Figures 2b and 3b).
[29] Transpiration in the fern-graminoid community in
2001 was 126 mm over the 38-day pre-monsoon period for
a T rate of 3.3 mm/day (Table 3). The T rate for the 28-day
post-monsoon period decreased to 1.7 mm/day in this com-
munity (Table 3). PET estimated with the Hamon method in
both communities was 2.6 mm/d for the premonsoon dry
period and 2.7 mm/d for the postmonsoon dry periods
(Table 3). AET was greater than PET by 1.7 (premonsoon
dry period) and 2.9 fold (postmonsoon dry period) (Table 3).
[30] The graminoid community transpired 157 mm of
water during 38-day pre-monsoon period in 2001, for a rate
of 4.1 mm/day (Table 3). The T rate of the graminoid
community was higher in the 28-day post-monsoon season
(5.0 mm/d) than in the premonsoon dry period (Table 3). E
rates ranged from 2.7 mm/day (premonsoon) to 4.2 mm/day
(postmonsoon) in the graminoid community. AET was
greater than PET by 2.6 (premonsoon dry period) to 3.4
fold (postmonsoon dry period) (Table 3).

2002 Growing Season
[31] Volumetric soil-water measurements started on April
9, 2002 and ended on September 24, 2002. The pre-monsoon
dry period lasted from April 9, 2002, to July 3, 2002, an
85-day period (Figure 4). The post-monsoon dry period
lasted 12 days from September 12, 2002, to September 24,
2002 because of heavy rains in late September.
[32] In 2002, treatment, community, and the treatment x
community interaction were significant sources of varia-
tion in q (Table 2). The graminoid community (Figure 4b)
reduced q more than the fern-graminoid community
(Figure 4a) at both dry periods. There was a 71% reduction
in q between clipped and unclipped graminoid plots at the
end of the premonsoon dry-down period versus 66% for the
fern-graminoid community. In the postmonsoon season dry
period in 2002, there was a 30% reduction in q in the
graminoid community versus 4% for the fern-graminoid
community.
[33] Transpiration in the fern-graminoid community was
56 mm over the 85-day pre-monsoon period in 2002
producing a T rate of 0.66 mm/day (Table 3). The T rate
for the 12-day post-monsoon period was similar at
0.63 mm/day (Table 3). E rates in 2002 in the fern-

graminoid community were between 1.2 mm/day (premon-
soon) and 6.4 mm/day (postmonsoon). PET estimated with
the Hamon method in both communities was 2.3 mm/d for
the premonsoon and 2.0 mm/d for the postmonsoon dry
periods (Table 3). AET was 80% of PET in the premonsoon
dry period, but was 3.5 fold higher in the postmonsoon dry
period (Table 3).
[34] The graminoid community transpired 97 mm of
water during the 85-day pre-monsoon period in 2002,
producing a rate of 1.1 mm/day (Table 3). The T rate of
the graminoid community was higher in the 12-day post-
monsoon season (6.3 mm/day) than the premonsoon dry
period (Table 3). E rates ranged from 1.1 mm/day (pre-
monsoon) to 2.3 mm/day (postmonsoon). AET was equal to
PET in the premonsoon dry period, but was 4.3 fold higher
in the postmonsoon dry period (Table 3).

Environmental Conditions
[35] Correlations between mean daytime VPD and T or
ET were calculated for each community using data polled
over years and dry-down periods (n = 6). For the fern-
graminoid community, VPD was not correlated with T (r =
0.70, p = 0.12), or ET (r = 0.52, p = 0.31). Similarly, VPD
was not correlated with T (r = 0.64, p = 0.17), or ET (r =
0.50, p = 0.31) for the graminoid community.
4.4.
Herbaceous Biomass
[36] Significant sources of variation in end-of-season
herbaceous biomass were herbaceous community (p <
0.0001) and the community x year interaction (p =
0.0328). Biomass for the fern-graminoid community was
significantly greater than biomass in the graminoid com-
munity in 2000 and 2001, with similar biomass in 2002
(Table 4). Biomass in the fern-graminoid community de-
creased in 2002 compared with 2000 and 2001, whereas
biomass in the graminoid community did not change
significantly over all years (Table 4).

Discussion
[37] The technique used to estimate ET and its compo-
nents in our study during dry-down periods assumed that all
changes to soil water in the rooting zone of the plant
community were attributed to E or T rather than inputs or
outputs of water from other sources. The use of distinct dry-
down periods having no precipitation eliminated effects of
direct inputs of water from recent precipitation. Another
possible input or output of water into the rooting zone of the
plants was water flow below the soil, but it is unlikely that
there was enough capillary rise in these cobbly loam soils
to draw water up from a water table which was generally
>1.4 m deep. Although we did not measure drainage
directly, we estimated that drainage may have been signif-
icant (>0.5 mm/d) when q > 0.28, or approximately greater
than the field capacity of the soils. Our use of clipped plots
in which all vegetation was removed allowed estimation of
T from the difference in q between clipped and unclipped
plots at the end of each dry period, and estimation of E from
temporal changes in q during dry periods in the clipped
plots. q was often similar between clipped and non-clipped
plots after recharge of soil water by snowmelt in the spring
or by monsoon rains. This finding suggests that clipping did
not strongly influence water infiltration into the soil. One
limitation of this technique is that estimates of ET during
periods of frequent precipitation or high antecedent soil
moisture, such as the monsoon season or wet winters in our
study, require accurate data on inputs of water from precip-
itation, and inputs and outputs from surface and subsurface
water flow. Our study lacks this data, and thus our estimates
of ET and its components are limited to the premonsoon
(late April to late June) and postmonsoon (late August to
late September) dry periods in each year.
[38] Our estimates of ET from changes in q are the most
accurate during dry-down periods when q < field capacity
because saturated drainage can be assumed to be minimal.
Two such dry-down periods occurred in our study, the pre-
monsoon periods of 2000 and 2002. Our estimates of actual
ET (AET) based on changes in q for these periods are
similar to PET estimated for the same periods with the
Hamon method, with AET/PET ratios that ranged between
0.8 and 1.4 (Table 3). T rates for these periods ranged
between 0.66 and 2.4 mm/d for the fern-graminoid com-
munity, and between 0.57 and 1.1 mm/day for the grami-
noid community (Table 3). Dry-down periods that included
conditions when q > field capacity (postmonsoon seasons all

years, premonsoon season 2001) occasionally produced
higher estimates of T, and AET/PET ratios greater than
1.4. During dry-down periods when q < field capacity, AET/
PET ratios were between 0.8 and 1.4. Although we did not
measure drainage, it is likely all AET/PET ratios >1.4 are
influenced by gravity drainage. These estimates of T are
likely overestimates because some of the soil water assumed
to be transpired or evaporated actually drained below the
plant roots and the depth of our 30 cm probes.
[39] Overall, T and ET were not significantly correlated
with changes in mean daytime VPD for the six dry-down
periods for both communities. The analyses were limited by
the narrow range of mean daytime VPD (1.6 to 2.2 kPa)
(Table 3), limited sample size (n = 6 dry-down periods), and
the lack of daily E and ET values.
[40] Transpiration by herbaceous plants at Hart Prairie
was an important component of site water balance in years
2000, 2001, and 2002 as shown by greater q in the upper
30 cm of soil in clipped compared with unclipped plots. An
important role of herbaceous transpiration on site water
balance similar to our results has been reported for prairie
vegetation in Colorado [Dodd et al., 1998] and eastern
Washington [Gee et al., 1994]. The years included in our
study were extremely dry (2002), moderately dry (2000),
and slightly dry (2001) compared to long-term average
precipitation, thus our results cannot be applied to wet years
without further study.
[41] The daily ET rates of fern-graminoid and graminoid
communities at Hart Prairie estimated from differences in
soil q (1.9 to 9.2 mm/d, depending on year, community and
season) are within the range of ET estimates from studies of
other vegetation communities in the western United States.
Raghuwanshi and Wallender [2000] estimated daily ET
rates of a grass reference crop in Davis, California, to range
between 3 mm/d and 12 mm/d. The higher ET rates reported
by Raghuwanshi and Wallender [2000] compared with our
study are likely the result of the lower elevation (17 versus
2600 m asl) and higher mean annual air temperature at their
study site. Scott et al. [2000] reported daily ET rates for a
mesquite (Prosopis sp.) stand in southern Arizona during the
growing seasontovarybetween 1.0and 2.4mm/d.ETrateina
young ponderosa pine stand in the Sierra Nevada Mountains,
California, estimated from eddy covariance data and
the biophysical model, FORFLUX, ranged between 1 and
5mm/ddependingonmeasurementdate[Kurpiusetal.,2003].
[42] Evaporation was an important component of ET in
our study, especially in the fern-graminoid community
where E rate exceeded T rate in four of the six combinations
of measurement year and season. In contrast, E was a less
important component of ET in the graminoid community; E
rate was greater than T rate in only one of six combinations
of year and season. However, E rate was at least 35% of T
rate in the graminoid community for all measurement
periods. Our finding of high E relative to T is consistent
with other studies in the southwestern United States. For
example, E and T rates were similar in a young ponderosa
pine stand in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, in
summer and fall when water stress limited plant transpira-
tion [Kurpius et al., 2003]. In contrast to these results, Black
and Kelliher [1989] estimated only a 10% loss of soil water
from E in a wetter ecosystem, a Douglas-fir forest with an
understory of salal (Gaultheria shallon) in British Colum-
bia, Canada. Intense solar radiation, low humidity, and low
leaf area compared to a forest help explain the high E rates
in our study in the high-elevation meadows of Hart Prairie.
[43] Biomass production of the two herbaceous commu-
nities was not clearly related to T rates. Biomass of the fern-
graminoid community was greater than biomass of the
graminoid community in every year. Differences were
greatest in 2001, the wettest year (fern-graminoid 263% >
graminoid), and lowest in 2002, the driest year (fern-
graminoid 28% > graminoid) (Table 4). Despite higher
biomass in the fern-graminoid community, T rate was 20
to 90% lower in this community compared with the grami-
noid community in five of six combinations of year and
season. This finding suggests pronounced differences be-
tween communities in physiological, morphological, or
environmental factors that influence T rate. For example,
higher T rate of the graminoid community may have
resulted from higher canopy conductance to water vapor,
a higher proportion of plant biomass in leaf area, lower
water use efficiency, greater penetration of solar radiation
into the canopy, or deeper, more expansive roots compared
with the fern-graminoid community.
[44] Comparisons between the slightly dry year of 2001
and the extreme drought year of 2002 suggest large differ-
ences in drought tolerance between herbaceous communi-
ties at Hart Prairie. In the fern-graminoid community, the
decrease in biomass from 2001 to 2002 (49%) was similar
to the decrease in water year precipitation (54%). In
contrast, biomass of the graminoid community increased
between these years by 44%. Effects of the 2002 drought on
T rate depended on measurement season. In the pre-mon-
soon season when effects of the 2002 drought on q were
most severe, T rate decreased about the same between 2001
and 2002 in both communities (80% fern-graminoid,
73% graminoid). In contrast, in the post-monsoon season,
T rate decreased from 2001 to 2002 by 63% in the fern-
graminoid community compared with an increase of 26% in
the graminoid community. These results suggest that fre-
quent severe droughts predicted in some climate change
scenarios for the southwest United States [Gregory et al.,
1997; Hanson and Weltzin, 2000; Rosenberg et al., 2003]
will reduce growth and transpiration at Hart Prairie more in
the fern-graminoid community than the graminoid commu-
nity which contains a greater dominance by species with the
C4 photosynthetic pathway.
[45] We hypothesized that T rate would be greater for
pines that are encroaching into Hart Prairie than the herba-
ceous communities based on previous watershed studies of

woody plant encroachment into grasslands [Bosch and
Hewlett, 1982; Zhang et al., 2001]. The T rate of a low
density stand (average density of 16 trees/ha) of ponderosa
and limber pines that have encroached into Hart Prairie
upslope of our study site based on sapflux data scaled to the
entire stand was estimated to range between 0.06 to
0.24 mm/day for a 60-day growing season in 2000 [Fischer,
2001; Fischer et al., 2002]. These rates are much lower than
the T rates of the fern-graminoid (2.4 to 3.1 mm/d) and
graminoid (0.57 and 5.7 mm/d) communities in our study in
2000. Thus, our results strongly refute our original hypoth-
esis, and suggest that herbaceous communities use more
water during the growing season than the scattered trees that
have encroached into the Prairie. This finding suggests that
thinning of the encroaching trees will have little effect on
the water balance of Hart Prairie.

Conclusions
[46] The purpose of our study was to evaluate the
potential role of herbaceous transpiration in limiting water
that supports seed germination and seedling survival of the
Bebb willow trees that grow in Hart Prairie, Arizona. Bebb
willow seed germination is promoted by dispersal to moist
soil [Waring, 1992a, 1992b; DeWald et al., 1998; DeWald
and Springer, 2001]. In every year of our study, seed
dispersal of Bebb willows occurred in June when q was
the lowest during the growing season. Soil q was higher in
clipped plots compared with unclipped plots in June in
every year and community. These results suggest that
control of herbaceous vegetation might be effective in
promoting regeneration of Bebb willow. Such control might
occur in small plots in the immediate vicinity of sexually
mature Bebb willows to provide areas of moist soil with
little herbaceous competition to promote seedling establish-
ment. Vegetation management that decreases T of herba-
ceous vegetation upslope of Bebb willow stands should
allow more recharge into shallow aquifers that support the
willows. Future research should address the type of man-
agement (e.g., burning, grazing) that would be effective in
reducing T of herbaceous communities as well as being
socially acceptable.
