Abstract
Prescribed burning has been suggested as a method to prevent shrub encroachment on
desert grasslands. A concern for range managers is the prevalence of introduced African
lovegrasses (Eragrostis spp.). These exotic grasses may compromise the effectiveness of ﬁre as
a range management tool in these areas due to their ﬁre tolerance. In this study we examined
the response of an established patch of Lehmann lovegrass to a prescribed burn. While
Lehmann lovegrass was not adversely affected by the prescribed burn, all of the native grasses
were compromised to some degree.

1. Introduction
The northern Chihuahuan Desert is experiencing a dramatic loss of its grasslands,
as are many arid and semi-arid lands in the world. In the mid-1800s, 58% of the area
of the Jornada Experimental Range (JER), in south-central New Mexico, consisted
of grassland devoid of shrubby vegetation. By the 1960s there were no upland
grasslands at the JER free of shrubs (Bufﬁngton and Herbel, 1965). In an attempt to

maintain the integrity of the remaining grasslands, the US Department of
Agriculture–Agricultural Research Service (USDA–ARS) is conducting research
on the effectiveness of prescribed burning to prevent shrub encroachment. This
method has been recommended by some authors for arid rangeland management in
southeastern Arizona because of high shrub-seedling mortality after burning
(Humphrey, 1958; Bahre, 1991). Others, however, have warned that this may not
be advisable due to the slow recovery of the important native grass, black grama
(Bouteloua eriopoda Torr.) after burning (Wright, 1980). An additional concern for
range managers is the prevalence of introduced African lovegrasses (Eragrostis spp.),
which may compromise the effectiveness of ﬁre as a range management tool in these
areas due to their ﬁre tolerance (Anable et al., 1992). The non-native Lehmann
lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana Nees.) is established in many of the remnant
grasslands on the JER. The potential response of this species to burning needs to be
considered in any range management program involving prescribed ﬁre.
Lehmann lovegrass was imported from South Africa to Superior, Arizona in 1932,
and was ﬁrst introduced on the JER in 1938. Its drought-tolerance and ability to
generate thick stands have made it a popular grass species for erosion control along
newly constructed roadways and ﬂood control projects. Additionally, it has been used
in rangeland reseeding projects as a replacement forage for areas where the native
grass species are disappearing. Since its introduction, however, Lehmann lovegrass has
established itself and expanded its range out into the surrounding native grasslands.
By 1984, in southeastern Arizona, it had more than doubled its range beyond where it
was directly seeded (Cox and Ruyle, 1986). In areas where it has become established,
Lehmann lovegrass has proven to be a highly competitive and invasive species. Anable
et al. (1992) reported that Lehmann lovegrass was present on 85% of 75 plots across
the Santa Rita Experimental Range (SRER) in southern Arizona, where it comprised
>40% of the perennial grass plants. In some areas it made up >90% of the grass
biomass. Bock et al. (1986) showed a serious decrease in most native plant species in
the presence of Lehmann lovegrass, which has also been shown to cause a reduction in
the local fauna (Bock et al., 1986; Whitford, 1997).
Lehmann lovegrass is a highly ﬁre-tolerant species. Most research has shown it to
recover quickly after burning (Cable, 1965; Pase, 1971; Martin, 1983), although some
studies have shown a reduction in cover in response to ﬁre (Bock and Bock, 1992). It
has been proposed that areas where Lehmann lovegrass has become established may
be at greater risk of ﬁre because lovegrass generates greater quantities of ﬁne fuels
than do native grasses (Cox et al., 1990; Anable et al., 1992). These traits, combined
with the highly competitive nature of Lehmann lovegrass, pose a risk of generating a
positive-feedback cycle enhancing both the frequency of ﬁres and the expansion of
Lehmann lovegrass (Anable et al., 1992). Such a system has been documented with
cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) in the intermontane grasslands of the western
United States (Mack, 1986) and other grass invasions throughout the world
(D’Antonio and Vitousek, 1992).
Most information on Lehmann lovegrass comes from research in the desert
grasslands of southeastern Arizona, primarily on the SRER. Few studies have
been conducted on its ecology in the northern Chihuahuan Desert (but see

Fredrickson et al., 1997; Fernandez and Reynolds, 2000) and little is known about its
response to ﬁre in this region.
In this study we examined the response of an established patch of Lehmann
lovegrass to a prescribed burn on the JER. We assessed how quickly it recovered from
ﬁre and whether burning affected the rate of expansion. Furthermore, we examined
the response of the native vegetation within and surrounding this patch to the presence
of lovegrass, as well as the effects of the prescribed burn on the native vegetation.
In addition to vegetation community parameters, we wanted to assess factors
which may inﬂuence the local ﬁre regime. We examined differences in the degree of
patchiness of the perennial grass cover, litter generation and litter distribution
between Lehmann-lovegrass-dominated areas and those dominated by native
grasses. Increased spatial homogeneity of grass cover and greater litter accumulation
can alter the local ﬁre cycle by facilitating the spread of ﬁre through an area. The
value of prescribed ﬁre in range management in semi-arid grasslands cannot be
properly assessed without understanding the response of invasive species to
treatments.
2. Methods
2.1. Study area
This research was conducted in Pasture 13 of the JER, located approximately
40 km NNE of Las Cruces, NM. This area is in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, in
the Jornada del Muerto Basin. Pasture 13 covers 409 ha, the majority of which is
semi-arid grassland. The dominant grasses are B. eriopoda, Aristida spp., and
Sporobolus spp. Shrub encroachment is evident throughout the pasture, with
Prosopis glandulosa Torr., Ephedra trifurca Torr., and Yucca elata Engelm.
dominating. Mesquite coppice dunes have started to form in the SE and NE
corners. A maintenance road for a Chevron Oil Company pipeline transects the
pasture, running approximately N–S. An established patch of E. lehmanniana
stretches for approximately 200 m along each side of the road. This pasture has been
grazed at varying intensities since before the establishment of the JER in 1912. Cattle
were excluded from the area from July 1998 until October 1999 when a light, year-
round grazing regime was reinstated.
Meteorological data collected since 1929 (at a rain gauge located about 1 km north
of the study site) report a mean annual precipitation of approximately 200 mm, with
55% of annual rainfall occurring from July 1 to September 30 in the form of
convective thunderstorms. Lightning strikes from these thunderstorms are often
responsible for initiating wildﬁres in desert grasslands.
2.2. Experimental treatment
In the fall of 1998, we marked a 175 m  300 m area encompassing the lovegrass
patch and a portion of the surrounding native grassland. We established 12 transects
ARTICLE IN PRESS
C.M. McGlone, L.F. Huenneke / Journal of Arid Environments 57 (2004) 297–310
299

within this site, six on each side of the pipeline road. The transects were
systematically placed at 50 m intervals running E–W using a compass to determine
the bearing. Transects on the east side of the road were 100 m long, while the ones on
the west side were 75 m, with each transect beginning in the center of the road. The
four northernmost were outside of the lovegrass patch, while the remaining eight
traversed the patch and entered into the area dominated by native grasses. Adjacent
transects were paired into six blocks, three on either side of the road. Within each
block, one transect was randomly chosen to be burned, while the other was left
as a control. Unburned buffer zones of 25 m were established on either side of
each transect.
The study area was burned over the course of 3 days in May 1999. During the
burn there was very low humidity and moderately high winds. A ﬁeld crew of 3–6
technicians conducted the burn on foot, using backpack-mounted propane torches.
Individual plants were brieﬂy ignited by the torches. No attempt was made to re-
ignite a plant if it failed to burn. Approximately 95% of the vegetative cover was
burned on the treatment transects (based on visual estimate). Since the soil
disturbance generated by burning the area is an inherent side effect of prescribed
ﬁres, no attempt was made to reproduce the soil disturbances in the control plots.
2.3. Vegetation cover measurements
Vegetation cover was visually estimated in 1 m  1 m quadrats located every 2 m
along the north side of each transect. This created 37 quadrats on each western
transect and 50 on the eastern ones. For analyses of vegetation cover, one of the
eastern blocks was excluded because one transect traversed the Lehmann lovegrass
patch while the other did not.
Vegetation cover estimates were made using a 1 m  1 m PVC frame which was
divided into 10 cm  10 cm sections using string. Each section, therefore, represented
1% of the quadrat. The frame was mounted on adjustable legs so it could be placed
above the vegetation without altering the natural form of the plants.
Within each quadrat, we visually estimated total cover for all perennial plant
species. The lowest possible cover was 0.1%, while greater covers were estimated in
0.25% increments. We measured annual forbs and grasses with density instead of
cover. Due to the large number of forbs and annual grasses present, we only
measured these species in the 25 cm  25 cm corner of the quadrat that was closest to
the transect and the origin. For perennials, all cover that fell within the quadrat was
measured. For annuals, however, only those plants that were rooted inside the
quadrat were recorded.
We completed pre-burn measurements in the fall of 1998 and post-burn
measurements in the fall of 1999 and 2000. When possible, every plant was
identiﬁed to species (grass identiﬁcations were based on Allred, 1993; all other taxa
were based on Correll and Johnston, 1970). All plants were identiﬁed to at least the
generic level. Of the native perennial grasses, the three-awns (Aristida spp.) and
dropseeds (Sporobolus spp.) were not identiﬁed beyond genus due to the difﬁculty in
accurately determining the species when the plant is not in ﬂower.

2.4. Vegetation point measurements
We also examined the spatial distribution of vegetation and litter to assess
potential impacts of Lehmann lovegrass on the ﬁre cycle. To do this, we took point
measurements within a set of quadrats within the lovegrass patch, completely outside
the patch, and in the adjacent transition area. These measurements were only
conducted along the belt transects in the three blocks where both transects traversed
the lovegrass patch.
The transects were divided into three zones: a Lehmann lovegrass zone within the
main patch of the lovegrass, a native grass zone, and a transition zone where the
native and invasive grasses were in contact. Within each zone, block, and treatment,
four quadrats were chosen at random for a total of 72 quadrats. In each quadrat, 41
point measurements were taken. The points were determined by the intersection of
the strings of the PVC frame described above, at which a straight wire was dropped
to the ground. Every perennial plant touched by the wire was recorded as a ‘‘hit’’.
The ground cover (i.e. bare ground, litter or root crown) contacted was also
recorded. These measurements were completed in the spring of 1999, before the
burn, and the fall of 2000.
2.5. Litter measurements
Litter was collected in the same quadrats used for the vegetation point
measurements. From the 41 points in each quadrat, three were selected at random
for each sampling period. If a point was selected for sampling, that point was then
excluded from successive sampling periods. At each point, litter was collected from a
5-in diameter circle. Samples were collected in mid-April 1999, immediately before
the burn, and in mid-September 2000. Litter samples were sieved with a 2 mm sieve
to remove soil, air-dried, and then weighed to the nearest hundredth of a gram.
2.6. Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS (SAS Institute, 1999). Analysis
of variance was performed using the PROC MIXED procedure. Data were analysed
as a Randomized Complete Block Design with a split plot in time. We tested the
mean vegetative cover response to the factors of year and burn-treatment, and the
year-by-treatment interaction. Analysis was conducted separately on each of the
dominant species (E. lehmanniana, B. eriopoda, Aristida spp., Sporobolus spp.,
Xanthocephalum sarothrae (Pursh) Shinners, Croton pottsii (Klotzsch) Muell.-Arg.,
Solanum elaeagnifolium Cav.) as well as various functional groups (native perennial
grasses, annual grasses, annual forbs, perennial forbs). In addition, the analysis of
variance model for each dominant species, excluding Lehmann lovegrass, and
functional group contained percent cover of Lehmann lovegrass as a co-variate.
Least-square means were also calculated for burn treatment. Means for the native
species were adjusted for the lovegrass co-variate, while means for Lehmann
lovegrass were unadjusted. Years were compared for each species and functional

group using LSD pairwise comparisons. We also compared the number of quadrats
per transect in which Lehmann lovegrass was detected across years and treatment
to determine if there was a change in the spatial distribution of the species. Finally,
we compared the response of each species to the treatment in transects which
traversed the Lehmann lovegrass patch with those that did not traverse it (ﬁxed
effect=‘‘Patch’’).
Analyses of variance were performed on the vegetation point measurements for
the ﬁxed effects of vegetation zone and treatment for each response (canopy cover,
litter distribution, etc.). Zones were compared using LSD pairwise comparisons.
Analysis of variance for the litter weights was complicated by non-normal
distribution of the data. Data were pooled within zones and log transformed for
the analysis.
3. Results
Canopy cover within the established patch of Lehmann lovegrass (as measured in
May 1999, immediately prior to the burn) was nearly twice that of the areas
dominated by native grasses (Table 1). During the prescribed burn, the thicker
canopy allowed the lovegrass-dominated areas to burn more quickly and with fewer
ignitions than the surrounding native grass area. Generally, in solid stands of
lovegrass the ﬁre would catch after igniting the ﬁrst plant and carry across the entire
patch. Burning native grass areas required walking to each small patch of grass and
lighting it. The ﬁre would rarely travel more than a few meters before it would reach
a bare area too wide for it to cross. There were two exceptions to this. One was in the
northeast corner of the site and the other was in a rill in the southeast part of the

collects and the native grasses are thick.
3.1. Vegetation cover measurements
The average percent cover per quadrat of Lehmann lovegrass did not differ
between treatments or years, nor was there a signiﬁcant interaction between these
factors (Table 2; Fig. 1). Conversely, the treatment by year interaction was
signiﬁcant for every native perennial grass species, as well as for native perennial
grasses as a functional group (Table 2). All of the native perennial grasses examined
showed a reduction in cover in response to the burn (Table 2). The effect of ﬁre was
most dramatically seen in black grama (B. eriopoda), which was the only perennial
grass to have a lower average percent cover in the treatment plots, the ﬁrst year after
burning, in spite of higher-than-average monsoon rains in 1999 (Fig. 2). Cover of
snakeweed (X. sarothrae) was also signiﬁcantly reduced by the burn and had not
recovered by the end of the second post-burn growing season. The only taxa to
increase after the burn were annual grasses and the perennial forb S. elaeagnifolium.
There was a signiﬁcant increase in the number of quadrats per transect on which
Lehmann lovegrass was present. The difference between 1998 (M ¼ 25) and 1999
(M ¼ 28) was signiﬁcant (t ¼ 2:52; p > jtj ¼ 0:0453), but between 1999 (M ¼ 28)
and 2000 (M ¼ 29) was not (t ¼ 0:52; p > jtj ¼ 0:6249). There was no detectable
difference in expansion of lovegrass area between burned and unburned transects
(F ¼ 1:11; df: ¼ 1; 3; p > F ¼ 0:3693). The majority of the range expansion occurred

Lehmann lovegrass patch versus those that did not. The only signiﬁcant response
was for Lehmann lovegrass (F ¼ 6:74; df: ¼ 1; 3; p > F ¼ 0:08).
3.2. Vegetation point measurements
Mean total canopy cover per quadrat was greater in the Lehmann lovegrass
zone than that in the transition zone or native grass zone, while the transition and
native grass zones did not differ (Table 1). Conversely, the amount of bare soil per
quadrat in the Lehmann lovegrass zones was markedly lower than in the native
zones, while the Lehmann lovegrass and native grass zones were indistinguishable
from the transition zone. The same pattern held true when examining the percent of
ground occupied by root crown. For none of these responses there was a signi-
ﬁcant difference detectable between the burned and control plots within each zone
(Table 1).
3.3. Litter analysis
No signiﬁcant difference was detected in the spatial distribution of litter between
vegetation zones (i.e. the cover of the litter was viewed independent of the quantity
of litter). A signiﬁcant difference was, however, detected in litter weight between
treatments (F ¼ 8:74; df: ¼ 1; 10; p > F ¼ 0:0144) and between years (F ¼ 4:49;
df: ¼ 2; 10; p > F ¼ 0:0406). There was nearly twice as much litter collected from the
lovegrass zones (4.8470.70 g) as from the native zones (2.5570.70 g). Litter weight
from the transition zones was indistinguishable from that from the native or
lovegrass zones (Table 1). The litter weight data were log transformed to achieve a
normal distribution. The non-transformed data showed the same trends for the ﬁxed
and main effects. The non-transformed data are presented in Table 1.
3.4. Climate data
Precipitation data from 1998 to 2000 were collected from a rain gauge located
approximately 1 km north of the study site. The ﬁrst post-burn growing season
(1999) had higher than average monthly rainfall from June to September, followed
by lower than average rainfall from November to May 2000 (Fig. 2).
4. Discussion
4.1. Response to ﬁre
The fact that Lehmann lovegrass did not increase in cover after the prescribed
burn on the JER runs contrary to previously published research. After a ﬁre in June
1963 on the SRER, there was a six-fold increase of the number of lovegrass plants in
areas where the species was already established and a three-fold increase of lovegrass
in areas originally dominated by black grama after the end of the ﬁrst post-ﬁre

306

growing season. No new black grama seedlings were discovered on the site (Cable,
1965). Another study on the SRER showed little difference in densities of lovegrass 1
year after the burn, but then saw a ﬁve-fold increase in the second year (Martin,
1983). The response of black grama in this second study was inconsistent, with some
plots showing no change after 4 years and others showing a reduction in density to as
little as 10% of pre-burn levels. In both of these studies, however, frequency was
used as a response (as opposed to cover), making it difﬁcult to compare with our
study. It is notable, however, that in both these studies, as well as ours, black grama
performed markedly worse than Lehmann lovegrass. Other studies have reported
similar ﬁndings for lovegrass, but did not monitor the response of black grama
(Humphrey and Everson, 1951; Pase, 1971). In a study that did measure changes in
cover after burning, both native grasses and lovegrass showed reduced cover for
both years observed (Bock and Bock, 1992). Wright (1980) cited the poor post-burn
performance of black grama as reason for not using prescribed ﬁre as a range
management tool on grasslands where it is the dominant species. In a study on the
JER, Cornelius (1988) detected a very slow recovery for black grama, compared to a
more rapid recovery by snakeweed and the shrub E. trifurca, suggesting that burning
may actually enhance desertiﬁcation of arid grasslands.
4.2. Effects on ﬁre cycle
While ﬁre may show no appreciable impacts on Lehmann lovegrass, there is a
potential for lovegrass to affect the local ﬁre cycle. D’Antonio and Vitousek (1992)
stress that grass invasions can dramatically alter the ﬁre regime of a region due to
increases in fuel load, greater ﬂammability, and the ability to recover quickly after a
ﬁre. This positive feedback has been documented with cheatgrass (B. tectorum) in
areas of Idaho and Oregon. Fire cycle intervals have dropped from an estimated 60–
110 years prior to invasion to the 3–5-year intervals seen currently (Mack, 1986).
Anable (1990) reported an increase in the frequency of ﬁres along roadsides of the
SRER where lovegrass is present.
Lehmann lovegrass has many properties that may encourage an elevated ﬁre
regime. Net annual above-ground primary production increases when lovegrass
dominates a site (Anable et al., 1992), and is as much as four times higher in pure
lovegrass stands than in sites where the native grasses have persisted (Cox et al.,
1990). This leads to large quantities of ﬂammable standing-dead biomass during the
dry season preceding the summer monsoons (Cox et al., 1990).
While our study detected no difference in the spatial distribution of litter between
the lovegrass-dominated areas and those dominated by native grasses, quantities of
litter were higher in the lovegrass patch. This would provide greater quantities of fuel
for ﬁre in the lovegrass patch. Furthermore, the results of this study show reduced
patchiness of the canopy cover in lovegrass-dominated areas, suggesting that ﬁre
would be able to spread more easily within a lovegrass patch than in native
grasslands. This was supported by visual observations made during the prescribed
burn. Fire spread more quickly and easily through the lovegrass patch than in the
surrounding areas dominated by native grasses. Further anecdotal evidence was

obtained during a series of arson ﬁres which were set in 2000 on the JER and
adjacent New Mexico State University and Bureau of Land Management property.
The ﬁres that carried farthest across the landscape were those set in areas dominated
by Lehmann lovegrass (J. Anderson, pers. comm.).
4.3. Effects on community dynamics
The impact of Lehmann lovegrass on the plant community in the Jornada Basin,
as seen in this study, is similar to that documented in Arizona. Lovegrass-dominated
areas have lower diversity and abundance of native plant species than adjacent areas
dominated by native grasses. It is likely that here, as elsewhere, in areas reduced to
nearly pure lovegrass, changes in trophic interactions between plants and herbivores
and changes in the physical structure of the vegetation could have a detrimental
effect on the local fauna (Bock et al., 1986; Williamson, 1996). Bock et al. (1986)
reported a decline in native vegetation in the presence of Lehmann lovegrass similar
to that seen in this study, as well as a reduction in animal biodiversity. Of the 43
plant and animal species they examined, 26 (10 plant, 5 bird, 3 rodent, 8
grasshopper) were shown to be signiﬁcantly more abundant in the native grasslands,
while only Botteri’s sparrow (Aimophila botterii), the hispid cotton rat (Sygmodon
hispidus), and the grasshopper species Phoetaliotes nebrascensis were shown to have
signiﬁcantly higher numbers in areas dominated by exotic grasses. Whitford (1997)
reports a reduction in diversity of breeding birds in lovegrass versus native grass
areas, while Medina (1988) reported that scaled quail (Calipela squamata) were more
prevalent in native grass sites than in ones dominated by lovegrass. It is reasonable
to expect a similar trend in areas dominated by Lehmann lovegrass in southern New
Mexico.
4.4. Implications for range management
While we observed no direct response of Lehmann lovegrass to burning, there is
indirect evidence suggesting that ﬁre may promote its spread. The ability of lovegrass
to recover more quickly from ﬁre than native grasses creates the potential for greater
seed production in the ﬁrst post-burn growing season. Furthermore, lovegrass seed
germinates at a higher rate in burned areas than unburned (Ruyle et al., 1988;
Sumrall et al., 1991), enhancing propagule pressure on the surrounding native
vegetation. There are currently well-established lovegrass populations in several
areas of the JER and adjacent properties. This provides numerous loci for seed
generation and dispersal.
These concerns about lovegrass invasion are exacerbated by the relatively slow
recovery of the native grasses. Since lovegrass recovers more rapidly than native
grasses after burning, lovegrass has more potential to generate and disperse seeds in
the ﬁrst growing season after the ﬁre. This may skew the seed bank in favor of
Lehmann lovegrass for future generations of seedlings. It is conceivable, therefore,
that this study was not long enough (two post-burn growing seasons) to detect the
full impact of the ﬁre on Lehmann lovegrass invasion. Longer-term monitoring of

the research area is necessary for comprehensive assessment of the full impact of
prescribed burning on the invasiveness of Lehmann lovegrass.
The highly competitive nature of lovegrass is also a concern for prescribed burning
in Chihuahuan Desert range management. Past studies have shown that disturbances
can facilitate persistence of invasive species in sites with established populations
(Hobbs and Huenneke, 1992). The rapid recovery rate of lovegrass after burning
combined with its ability to out-compete most native grasses may promote the
exclusion of native species in areas where lovegrass is currently established. The
cumulative effect of these factors calls into question the feasibility of using
prescribed burning to manage desert grasslands where this invasive species occurs in
the landscape.
