Intermountain West Frequent-Fire Forest Restoration
Ecological restoration is a practice that seeks to heal degraded ecosystems by reestablishing native species, 
structural characteristics, and ecological processes. The Society for Ecological Restoration International 
defines ecological restoration as “an intentional activity that initiates or accelerates the recovery of an 
ecosystem with respect to its health, integrity and sustainability … Restoration attempts to return an 
ecosystem to its historic trajectory” (Society for Ecological Restoration International Science and Policy 
Working Group 2004).
Most frequent-fire forests throughout the Intermountain West have been degraded during the last 150 
years. Many of these forests are now dominated by unnaturally dense thickets of small trees, and lack 
their once diverse understory of grasses, sedges, and forbs. Forests in this condition are highly susceptible 
to damaging, stand-replacing fires and increased insect and disease epidemics. Restoration of these forests 
centers on reintroducing frequent, low-severity surface fires—often after thinning dense stands—and 
reestablishing productive understory plant communities.
The Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University is a pioneer in researching, 
implementing, and monitoring ecological restoration of frequent-fire forests of the Intermountain West. 
By allowing natural processes, such as low-severity fire, to resume self-sustaining patterns, we hope to 
reestablish healthy forests that provide ecosystem services, wildlife habitat, and recreational opportunities.

A Summary of the Natural Range of Variability for Southwestern Frequent-Fire Forests

Ecological Restoration Institute  •  working paper 42 
Introduction
Land management agencies are directed to promote 
ecologically resilient landscapes and restore fire adapted 
ecosystems on national forest system and other public lands 
(USDA Forest Service 2012). The natural range of variability 
(NRV), also described as historical range of variability 
(HRV), describes the natural ecological conditions and 
processes on a landscape that existed over broad lengths 
of evolutionary time and space, before intensive human 
alteration (Landres et al. 1999, Keane et al. 2009). The NRV 
quantifies the natural and historical disturbance processes and 
ecosystem variability that these disturbances create, and can 
inform land management and restoration efforts (Covington 
and Moore 1994, Allen et al. 2002). Ecological systems 
managed within their natural range of variability (NRV) of 
stand structure and composition are thought to provide the 
best chance for recovery from degradation and disturbance, 
and increased resilience to climate changes.
Past land use and fire exclusion have transformed frequent 
fire forest systems in to dense and unhealthy forest conditions, 
with increased fuel loads, less diverse understory communities, 
degraded wildlife habitats, and ultimately, increased 
susceptibility to high severity fire, insects, and pathogens 
(Covington and Moore 1994). Understanding natural patterns 
and processes informs ecological restoration treatments to 
restore forests to be resilient to future disturbances. Natural 
range of variability of a system is used to restore these forests 
to a healthy ecosystem functioning within its evolutionary 
envelope. Site-specific data on forest structure and composition 
is collected and analyzed, and a reference data set is 
determined. Treatments are then designed and implemented 
based on this information in addition to the management goals 
of the landscape, and are intended to incorporate multiple 
management objectives. These treatments are designed to 
reduce fire risk to communities, improve wildlife habitats, 
and restore forests to be resilient to future disturbances under 
changing precipitation and temperature conditions.
The natural range of variability can be used to restore 
natural patterns and processes in forests altered due to fire 
exclusion, grazing, and logging practices, while also increasing 
the resilience of these forests to hotter and drier future climatic 
conditions (Reynolds et al. 2013). Climate change impacts in 
southwestern forests are expected to exacerbate forests’ current 
susceptibility to uncharacteristically severe disturbances, 
like high-severity wildfire, intense rains, and flash floods 
(McDowell et al. 2016, Vose et al. 2016, Swetnam et al. 1999). 
Long-term shifts in forest cover types and vegetation patterns 
are predicted to occur (Westerling et al. 2006, Williams et 
al. 2013, McDowell and Allen 2015), and decreased forest 
productivity is expected (USDA Forest Service 2005). In the 
highly departed fire-adapted forests of the Southwest, the NRV 
reflects the evolutionary history of the system and its ability to 
be resilient to disturbances and changes in climate over long 
time periods. Land management actions informed by NRV 
has the best opportunity to incorporate ecological variability 
and therefore enhance biodiversity, recognizes the role of 
disturbance, and can maintain ecosystem resilience (Millar et al. 
2007, Reynolds et al. 2013, Stoddard et al. 2015).
Throughout the Southwest region, numerous studies in 
frequent-fire forests have characterized NRV (Reynolds et al. 
2013, Schneider et al. 2015, Rodman et al. 2017). This working 
paper updates an Ecological Restoration Institute fact sheet 
(Stoddard 2011) to 1) compile site-specific historical forest 
structural data from across the Southwest adding 22 new 
studies, and 2) provide management recommendations for best 
use of this science. The scope of this paper is to present NRV 
information reported in other studies in ponderosa pine and 
dry mixed conifer forest types dominated by ponderosa pine, 
and summarize this information for use by land managers. We 
do not address spatial patterns, diameter ranges, or wet mixed 
conifer in this paper. 
Methods
We conducted a literature review of historical structural 
characteristics in forests specific to the lower portion of the 
southern Colorado plateau, and areas covering Arizona and New 
Mexico (Figure 1). We used studies that included at least one 
method of describing the NRV, such as dendrochronological 
reconstruction, historical stand inventories, and standing 
age class quantification of sites. Historical inventories were 
conducted to quantify standing forest stock and mortality, 
most often by the Forest Service between 1909 and 1952. 
Reconstruction of historical site conditions was performed 
either through dendrochronological analysis of living and 
dead material, or assessments of live tree age classes to provide 
quantitative estimates of forest structural conditions prior to 
historical fire exclusion. These studies often additionally assessed 
current conditions, including species composition, trees per 
acres (TPA), and basal area (BA). Study sites are referenced by 
number, and site numbers coincide in Table 1, Figure 2, and 
review study references. Note that some studies are listed more 
than once, if they spanned multiple study sites.  
We focused on three frequent-fire forest types dominated 
by ponderosa pine: pine-oak (PO), ponderosa pine (PP), and 
dry mixed-conifer (MC). We extracted information including: 
parent material, average elevation, historical total trees per acre 
(TPA) and basal area (BA), landownership, and the historical 
reference date. Finally, we included diameter at breast height 
(DBH) and age distributions, if they were reported, and 
summarized all results in tabular form (Table 1). We identified 
a total of 67 with the addition of 22 new studies where 
either historical forest inventories or dendrochronological 
reconstructions were produced (Table 1). 
Results
Of the 67 studies, all were dominated by ponderosa pine, 
distributed as: pine-oak (18 studies), ponderosa pine (34 studies), 
and dry mixed-conifer (15 studies) forests (Table 1). The mixed 
conifer vegetation groupings were all dry mixed conifer, as 
described by Reynolds et al. 2013. The study sites varied by 
forest type, elevation, and parent material (Table 1), and are 
representative of the variability in pine dominated forests across 
the southwest. The majority of studies occurred on Forest Service 
lands, but also were conducted on Bureau of Land Management 
(BLM), National Park Service (NPS), Tribal (Bureau of Indian

Affairs, BIA) and Department of Defense (DOD) lands. The 
dates of reconstruction and/or inventory span a relatively small 
time period from 1867 to 1929.
Total tree density and basal area are plotted for each 
vegetation type (Figure 2) and are based on 95 percent 
confidence intervals of the mean. Trees per acre varied by 
forest type, with average site TPA ranging from 39.3–54.4 
TPA in pine-oak, 33.1–55.2 TPA in ponderosa pine, and 
44.0–73.0 TPA in dry mixed-conifer forests (Table 2). 
Interquartile variabilty is highest in mixed conifer ecosytems. 
Rodman et al. (2017) attribute this increased variability 
to more diverse topographic conditions (slope and aspect) 
found in the higher elevation dry mixed-conifer sites. Sites 
dominated by limestone soils tend to support greater tree 
densities and higher tree biomass than other sites (Abella et 
al. 2011, Reynolds et al. 2013). 
The overall densification of western fire-adapted forests 
since fire exclusion around the late 1800s is well documented 
(Covington and Moore 1994, Fulé et al. 1997, Hessburg et 
al. 2005, Fulé et al. 2012, Stephens et al. 2015, Rodman et al. 
2017). Many studies that compared historical inventories and 
dendrochronological information to todays conditions observed 
that current forests have changed drastically in terms of tree 
density, canopy cover, and basal area (Fulé et al. 1997, Stephens 
et al. 2015, Rodman et al. 2017). Today’s forests are more dense 
than they were historically, and mesic sites tend to have a higher 
increased density than more xeric sites (Rodman et al. 2017).  
Summary
Historic forest data across 59 of the 67 sites show high 
variability in historic forest conditions found at the time of 
fire exclusion in the southwest. While the temporal span of 
historical inventory or reconstructed forest conditions is less 
than 60 years, the spatial span, combined with additional 
historical information including fire history studies (Swetnam 
and Baisan 1996) give broad support to tree densification as 
a major driver of the increased fire severity currently found in 
frequent-fire forests across the West. Today’s forested stands are 
consistently well outside the NRV observed from these studies, 
and forests can be 5 to 10 times as dense as historic stands 
(Covington and Moore 1994, Rodman et al. 2017). While site-
specific data may not be available for every acre, the patterns 
of tree densification since fire exclusion across forests in the 
Southwest region are ubiquitous. 
Today’s federal land management goals are impacted by 
climate change expectations of warming conditions, leading to 
decreased available moisture and altered precipitation patterns 
(Willliams et al. 2013). As growing wildfire size and increased 
fire severity change landscapes at a scale greater than current 
restoration treatments, studies and knowledge of the NRV can 
and need to be used in multiple ways. Federal managers need to 
understand and quantify measures of ecosystem sustainability 
and resilience as a foundation to inform future management 
directions. Reference conditions and NRV information can 
be used to inform sustainability metrics for forest treatments, 
wildlife habitat, biodiversity, and long term monitoring while 
also increasing the resilience of these forests to more extreme 
future climatic conditions and disturbance regimes. 
Abiotic and biotic factors influence forest structure and 
species compoisition, as well as ecosytem processes (Abell 
a and Denton 2009, Reynolds et al. 2013).  Environmental 
factors such as soil type, parent material, elevation, 
and precipitation patterns are important drivers of site 
productivity (Reynolds et al. 2013, Rodman et al. 2017) and 
should be taken into account when making management 
decisions. There is a lack of large landscape-scale reference 
information, and we recognize that data gaps exist. The 
data compilation in this paper can help identify where 
more information and data is needed to add to the body 
of knowledge. For example, data gaps exist in transitional 
ponderosa pine zones, and areas on the Gila and Tonto 
National Forests, illuminating data opportunities. Regional 
summaries should be used when localized data is unavailable.  
Management Implications 
• 
Use of the NRV as a management tool is intended to 
be adaptive in order to address ecosystem dynamics and 
incorporate multiple management objectives. There is no 
one size fits all prescription. Site history, management 
objectives, and environmental factors should be taken in to 
account when designing treatments.
• 
Reference conditions and natural range of variability 
information can be used to restore natural patterns and 
processes to forests while also increasing the resilience of 
these forests to more extreme future climatic conditions 
and disturbance regimes.
• 
Broad spatial studies of historical forest conditions 
suggest increases in tree density are ubiquitous across 
the southwest, but there is also high variability in 
forest structure and tree density within frequent-fire 
forests, influenced by elevation, parent soil material, and 
subsequent overstory forest composition. Use site-specific 
or localized NRV when available to inform restoration 
objectives.
• 
When localized information is not available, infer NRV 
from regional summaries, and allow for broadest range 
of variability in planning treatments (include lowest and 
highest range of forest density).
o	 In ponderosa and pine-oak forests, the lower 
elevation, more xeric sites on basalt soils typically 
supported lower ranges of tree densities.
o	 Ponderosa pine on limestone soils typically supported 
higher ranges of tree densities.
o	 Dry mixed-conifer forests, dominated by ponderosa, 
supported broad ranges of tree densities, most likely 
influenced by site aspect and parent soil type. South-
facing stands on basalt soils may support lower tree 
densities than adjacent, north-facing aspects.
