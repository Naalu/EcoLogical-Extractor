gross nitrogen (N) transformations. We hypothesized that N 
availability in burned patches would become more similar 
to those in unburned patches over time after ﬁre as these 
areas become re-vegetated. Burned patches had higher 
net and gross nitriﬁcation rates than unburned patches 
(P < 0.01 for both), and nitriﬁcation accounted for a greater 
proportion of N mineralization in burned patches for both 
net (P < 0.01) and gross (P < 0.04) N transformation meas-
urements. However, trends with time-after-ﬁre were not 
observed for any other variables. Our ﬁndings contrast with 
previous work, which suggested that high nitriﬁcation rates 
are a short-term response to disturbance. Furthermore, high 
nitriﬁcation rates at our site were not simply correlated with 
the presence of herbaceous vegetation. Instead, we suggest 
that stand-replacing wildﬁre triggers a shift in N cycling 
that is maintained for at least three decades by various fac-
tors, including a shift from a woody to an herbaceous eco-
system and the presence of ﬁre-deposited charcoal.

Introduction
Complex interactions between land management and cli-
mate change have led to pronounced changes in the wild-
ﬁre disturbance regimes of coniferous forests throughout 
the western United States (US; McKenzie et al. 2004; Wil-
liams et al. 2010). Wildﬁre is the most pervasive natural 
disturbance in these ecosystems (Agee 1998), and a century 
of ﬁre exclusion, coupled with a warmer and drier climate, 
have led to widespread build-ups in fuel loadings, as well 
as increases in the frequency and size of stand-replacing 
wildﬁres throughout this region (Covington and Moore 
Abstract Stand-replacing wildﬁres are a novel distur-
bance within ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of 
the southwestern United States, and they can convert for-
ests to grasslands or shrublands for decades. While most 
research shows that soil inorganic N pools and ﬂuxes return 
to pre-ﬁre levels within a few years, we wondered if vege-
tation conversion (ponderosa pine to bunchgrass) following 
stand-replacing ﬁres might be accompanied by a long-term 
shift in N cycling processes. Using a 34-year stand-replac-
ing wildﬁre chronosequence with paired, adjacent unburned 
patches, we examined the long-term dynamics of net and

1994; Westerling et al. 2006). Severe ﬁres can alter plant 
community structure (Hebel et al. 2009), primary produc-
tivity (Sabo et al. 2008), microbial communities (Smith-
wick et al. 2005), and the biogeochemical cycling of car-
bon (C; Kashian et al. 2006) and nitrogen (N; DeLuca 
et al. 2002; Turner et al. 2007). Some coniferous forests 
are adapted to high-severity wildﬁres (e.g., jack pine, Pinus 
banksiana Lamb., and lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta 
Douglas ex Louden var. latifolia Engelm. ex S. Watson), 
but others, such as southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus 
ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson var. scopulorum Engelm), 
are adapted to low-intensity surface ﬁre regimes (Cooper 
1960). For these forests, the relatively common occurrence 
of high-severity ﬁres over the last ~40 years (Covington 
et al. 1997) constitutes a major shift in their natural distur-
bance regime. The frequency of stand-replacing wildﬁres is 
predicted to increase in the western US (Westerling et al. 
2006), but the long-term implications of a disturbance 
regime shift on ecosystem functioning are uncertain.
The effects of stand-replacing wildﬁres on N cycling 
dynamics are of particular interest because N, along with 
water, is limiting to cone production and diameter growth 
in southwestern ponderosa pine forests (Heidmann et al. 
1979; Heidmann 1984). Accordingly, post-ﬁre N avail-
ability may be critical to pine regeneration and net primary 
productivity. Historically, the relatively rapid turnover of 
N was the result of a frequent, low-intensity surface ﬁre 
regime, which maintained the forest structure in uneven-
aged groups with abundant herbaceous openings (Cooper 
1960; White 1985). Hart et al. (2005) hypothesized that this 
vegetation structure inﬂuenced the belowground micro-
bial community, which, in turn, promoted rapid N cycling. 
However, ﬁres in this region were virtually eliminated by 
practices introduced by Euro-American settlers in the late 
1800s: livestock grazing reduced herbaceous fuels that 
would carry a surface ﬁre, and active ﬁre suppression led to 
extended periods of ﬁre exclusion (Covington et al. 1997). 
Current forests are characterized by high densities of small 
diameter trees (Covington and Moore 1994), and associ-
ated net N transformation rates are less than half that of 
the historic regime, as suggested by forest restoration treat-
ments (Kaye and Hart 1998a).
Although ﬁres result in a loss of organic N stored in 
biomass (Johnson et al. 2005), they also initiate a tem-
porary pulse in available N in the soil, which may facili-
tate post-ﬁre regeneration (White 1986; Covington and 
Sackett 1992). This pulse is initially comprised of pyro-
genically produced ammonium (NH4
+), which remains 
high for approximately 1–2 years following ﬁre (Raison 
1979; Turner et al. 2007). Increased concentrations of 
nitrate (NO3
−) follow the NH4
+ pulse as nitriﬁcation is 
enhanced by higher substrate availability (NH4
+; Robert-
son and Vitousek 1981), higher soil temperature and pH 
(Christensen 1973; Bauhus et al. 1993), and the presence of 
ﬁre-deposited charcoal (DeLuca and Sala 2006). Elevated 
levels of NO3
− reach their maximum approximately 1 year 
after prescribed burning (Wan et al. 2001). Nitrogen avail-
ability may decline over secondary succession as plant–
microbial competition for N increases (Kaye and Hart 
1997) and regenerating vegetation alters the soil microcli-
mate (Vitousek et al. 1989).
Despite the multitude of studies that have been con-
ducted on the short-term N cycling responses to wildﬁre, 
there is comparatively little known about the long-term 
(years to decades) effects. Long-term declines in inorganic 
N availability over time since stand-replacing wildﬁres 
have been reported in northern boreal forests (DeLuca et al. 
2002) and lodgepole pine forests (Turner et al. 2007), while 
increases have been observed in jack pine (Yermakov and 
Rothstein 2006) and southern boreal forests (Brais et al. 
1995). Notably, all of these long-term studies occurred in 
forests that are adapted to stand-replacing ﬁre regimes.
Unlike ecosystems that are adapted to stand-replacing 
ﬁre disturbance (e.g., boreal forest, lodgepole pine), post-
ﬁre ponderosa pine regeneration is slow and variable (Sav-
age and Mast 2005; Crotteau et al. 2013), which can cause 
burned forests to remain in grass- or shrub-dominated 
states for extended periods (Roccaforte et al. 2012). This 
state-shift may favor a prolonged post-ﬁre enhancement of 
inorganic N availability and net N transformations by main-
taining higher soil temperatures and pH and limiting plant 
uptake of N compared to unburned forests. Conversely, 
stand-replacing wildﬁres are associated with long-term 
reductions in soil C in these systems (Ross et al. 2012); this 
may limit microbial activity and constrain gross production 
of NH4
+ over time (Koyama et al. 2010).
Our objective was to assess the effects of a novel dis-
turbance, stand-replacing wildﬁres, on N cycling dynam-
ics in southwestern ponderosa pine forests. We measured 
N availability (inorganic N pools and net N transformation 
rates) and gross N production rates along a wildﬁre chron-
osequence. Each burned area (patch) was paired with an 
adjacent area (patch) in unburned forest to better isolate the 
effects of time after ﬁre. We hypothesized that N availabil-
ity would initially be high following stand-replacing wild-
ﬁres, but, as secondary succession proceeds and vegetation 
demand for N increases, availability would decline over 
time, eventually resembling that of comparable unburned 
forests. We predicted that elevated rates of nitriﬁcation 
would drive increases in N availability in burned patches, 
and that differences between burned and unburned patches 
would be more pronounced during the summer monsoon 
season (early July to mid-September) when biological 
activity is maximized. We also hypothesized that gross 
nitriﬁcation rates would decline over time after ﬁre because 
of decreases in substrate availability, soil temperature, and

soil pH, as well as the declining effect of charcoal inputs 
occurring over succession. Conversely, gross N minerali-
zation rates would increase over time after ﬁre as initial C 
limitations resulting from combustion (Koyama et al. 2010; 
Ross et al. 2012) would be ameliorated by increasing C 
inputs from plant litter (Turner et al. 2007). Both gross N 
production rates would eventually resemble those of com-
parable unburned forest (Davidson et al. 1992).
Materials and methods
Study sites and experimental design
We conducted this study across seven post-wildﬁre sites 
in ponderosa pine forests of northern Arizona, US. Sites 
were located on basaltic parent material and each had 
experienced one stand-replacing crown ﬁre (>95 % tree 
mortality) within the last 60 years according to records at 
Coconino and Kaibab National Forests (Table 1). The Fort 
Valley weather station (within 23 km and at a similar eleva-
tion to all sites) received 65.4 cm of precipitation during 
the 12-month study period (1 July 2007–1 July 2008; www
.wrcc.dri.edu). The mean daily maximum and minimum air 
temperatures for the same period were 17.2 and −3.7 °C, 
respectively. The 30-year averages (1971–2000) for the sta-
tion were 56.3 cm/year of precipitation, with mean daily 
maximum and minimum air temperatures of 16.3 and 
−3.6 °C, respectively. Approximately half of the precipi-
tation falls in the form of snow during the winter months, 
while the remainder falls as rain during the summer mon-
soon season (early July to mid-September).
We employed a chronosequence (space-for-time substi-
tution) approach to examine the long-term effects of stand-
replacing wildﬁres. We sampled a broad temporal extent 
(seven sites over a 34-year period) rather than replicating 
sites over a smaller number of years because this design 
was better suited to illustrate changes in N cycling dynam-
ics over time. Each site consisted of a burned patch paired 
with an adjacent patch of unburned forest to better isolate 
the effects of ﬁre from other sources of variation (John-
son and Miyanishi 2008). We recognize that the chronose-
quence approach has lower inferential power than a true 
experiment, and we note that conclusions derived from the 
results are based on the assumption that burned patches 
and their paired unburned patches were similar prior to the 
ﬁre. Additionally, two of the older wildﬁre sites (23 and 
34 years-after-ﬁre) were salvage logged and replanted after 
the ﬁre, which was the typical management practice at the 
time (the other sites did not receive active post-ﬁre man-
agement). While this management difference also limits 
our study design, we felt that the need for a clearer under-
standing of long-term post-wildﬁre ecosystem functioning, 
coupled with the limited number of suitable wildﬁre sites in 
this region, justiﬁed the inclusion of these older sites. Fur-
thermore, a companion study performed at this chronose-
quence found that pools of C and N (live plant biomass and 
woody debris C; mineral soil and organic horizon C and N) 
remained relatively constant with time after ﬁre (Ross et al. 
2012), suggesting that the management did not substan-
tially compromise the chronosequence.
At each burned patch, we established three 300-m tran-
sects within the perimeter of the burn. Similarly, we estab-
lished transects in the paired unburned patches. Burn area 
heterogeneity prevented identical transect orientation and 
layout across all the sites, but we attempted to sample in 
a similar manner as much as possible; this included cov-
ering a similar areal extent at all the burned and unburned 
patches. Three 10-m-radius plots were located 150 m apart 
along each of the three transects for a total of nine plots at 
each patch (n = 9). Plots were at least 100 m from active 
roads and 20 m from trails or old logging roads. At most 
of the burned patches, transects were at least 100 m from 
unburned forest; however, at the two most recent burns 
(2 and 6 years-after-ﬁre), the size and perimeter of the 
burn meant that several plots were as little as 25 m from 
unburned forest. Table 1 presents basic soil and vegetation 
characteristics.
Quantiﬁcation of net N mineralization rates
We measured in situ net N transformation (i.e., net N min-
eralization and net nitriﬁcation) rates in one incubation 
from early July through October 2007 (monsoon season), 
and a second incubation from October to early July 2008 
(winter–spring). We used the resin core method (DiStefano 
and Gholz 1986), as modiﬁed by Kaye and Hart (1998a) 
for concurrent measurement of net N transformations in 
the forest ﬂoor (O horizon) and mineral soil (0–15 cm). 
The cores were incubated at a ﬁxed distance (7.5 m) and 
bearing from the plot center. Net N mineralization and net 
nitriﬁcation in the mineral soil were calculated as the dif-
ference between the initial and ﬁnal mineral soil N pools 
(NH4
+ + NO3
− for mineralization; NO3
− for nitriﬁca-
tion) pools plus the (NH4
+ + NO3
−)-N adsorbed onto the 
mixed-bed, ion exchange resin (IER) bag ﬁxed beneath the 
mineral soil. Forest ﬂoor net N mineralization and nitriﬁ-
cation were estimated similarly by placing a second IER 
bag on top of the mineral soil core and putting forest ﬂoor 
material on top of this bag. There was not sufﬁcient forest 
ﬂoor material at the wildﬁre sites to estimate N transforma-
tions, but we placed an IER bag on top of the mineral soil 
to quantify throughfall inputs and be consistent with resin 
cores in unburned patches (Grady and Hart 2006).
The soils were stored at 4 °C (≤5 days) until 30 g of 
sieved ﬁeld-moist (<4 mm) mineral soil were extracted in

100 mL of 2 M KCl and the IER was extracted in 100 mL 
of 2 M KCl. We removed items >1 cm in diameter from 
the forest ﬂoor and cut the remainder with scissors and 
homogenized before extracting 5 g in 25 mL of 2 M KCl. 
Extracts were mechanically shaken for 1 h, ﬁltered through 
preleached (with deionized water) Whatman #1 ﬁlters, and 
frozen until they were analyzed for NH4
+, and NO3
− on a 
Lachat AE Flow-Injection Analyzer (Lachat Instruments, 
Loveland, CO, USA), using indophenol blue (Lachat 
Instruments, 1990) and cadmium reduction-diazotization 
(Lachat Instruments, 1992) methods, respectively. The 
mean bulk density for all four mineral soil cores taken dur-
ing the study period (2 incubation periods, 1 initial and 1 
ﬁnal for each) was used to convert the mineral soil mass-
based transformation rates to an areal basis. Forest ﬂoor 
transformations were converted to an areal basis using the 
mean bulk density of two 30 × 30 cm quadrats taken at 
each plot.
We also performed an aerobic laboratory incubation 
to assess net N transformation rates under constant tem-
perature and moisture conditions. We used mineral soil 
(0–15 cm depth) from each of the nine plots within each 
patch (n = 9) collected in 2007. Approximately 10 g of 
air-dried, sieved (<2 mm) soil was placed in a 120-mL 
glass jar, re-wetted to 60 % water holding capacity (Paul 
et al. 1999), and incubated at 22 °C for 28 days. Jar lids 
were loosely sealed to permit air exchange, and distilled 
water was added as needed to maintain soil water content. 
Initial and ﬁnal pools of NH4
+, and NO3
− were deter-
mined by extracting 10 g of soil in 100 mL of 2 M KCl 
and analyzing the extracts on a microplate reader (Multi-
skan EX; Thermo Scientiﬁc). The salicylate method was 
used for NH4
+ and Devarda’s alloy/salicylate method was 
used for NH4
+ + NO3
− (Sims et al. 1995); NO3
− pools 
were determined by subtracting the NH4
+ pool from the 
NH4
+ + NO3
− pool. Net N transformation rates were cal-
culated as the difference between initial and ﬁnal inorganic 
pools (NH4
+ + NO3
− for mineralization; NO3
− for nitriﬁ-
cation), and expressed as daily rates (mg m−2 days−1) using 
the mean bulk density computed previously.
Quantiﬁcation of gross N transformation rates
We used the 15N isotope dilution method (Hart et al. 1994) 
to measure gross N transformation rates in a 24-h labora-
tory incubation. We selected a subset of the burned and 
unburned chronosequence sites (5 of the 7 original: 2, 7, 
11, 30, and 34 years-after-ﬁre) and plots (6 plots per patch) 
for these measurements to reduce the number of analyses, 
which are both time consuming and expensive, and still 
compare older and recent ﬁres. We conducted this meas-
urement in mid-August 2008, because the soil was moist 
and warm from the summer monsoons, and we expected N 
transformations to be maximized during this period (Kaye 
and Hart 1998b). We also measured soil temperatures at 
these sites by placing a data logger at each site (Hobo Pen-
dant Data Loggers; Onset Computer, Bourne, MA, USA) 
at a depth of 5 cm in the mineral soil; values were recorded 
every 10 s for 3.5 weeks.
We collected mineral soil (0–10 cm) for the gross N 
transformation incubation on 11, 12, and 13 August 2008 
by taking cores with an Oakﬁeld sampler (1.9-cm diam-
eter; Oakﬁeld Apparatus, Oakﬁeld, WI, USA) from a 0.5-
m2 area at a ﬁxed (7.5 m) distance from the plot center 
(opposite bearing of the net transformation cores). Soils 
were kept on ice while in transport and then refrigerated 
for 24–48 h. We sieved (<4 mm) soils at ﬁeld-moisture 
content, and, on 14 August 2008, we weighed approxi-
mately 25 g of sieved soil into each of ﬁve specimen con-
tainers. One sample was used to estimate initial pools sizes 
of NH4
+ and NO3
− while the other four samples were 
divided into nitriﬁcation or mineralization groups at time 
0 h (t0) or time 24 h (t24). We injected 0.35 mL of a labeled 
solution, 15NO3
− as K15NO3
− or 15NH4
+ as (15NH4
+)2SO4 
(200 mg N/L; 99 atom  % 15N enrichment) uniformly into 
the appropriate soil using a syringe and needle. The injec-
tions added approximately 3.5 mg N/kg dry soil for both 
of the N species and increased the gravimetric water con-
tent (GWC; kg H2O kg−1 dry soil) by approximately 7 % 
on a relative basis (1.7 % absolute change). The t0 soils 
were immediately extracted. The t24 soils were incubated 
inside sealed glass Mason jars (~1 L) with distilled water 
at the bottom to maintain the moisture content for 24 h in 
the dark at 20 °C. Soils were extracted as described above 
for in situ net N transformation rates using 100 mL 2 M 
KCl and frozen until subsequent colorimetric analysis (ini-
tial pool sizes) or preparation for 15N analysis.
We performed the 15N analyses using the diffusion pro-
cedure described by Stark and Hart (1996). The 15N con-
tents were determined on the diffusion extracts using an 
elemental analyzer interfaced to a continuous ﬂow isotope 
ratio mass spectrometer (University of California, Davis, 
Stable Isotope Facility; PDZ Europa ANCA-GSL elemen-
tal analyzer interfaced to a PDZ Europa 20-20 isotope ratio 
mass spectrometer; Sercon, Cheshire, UK). We used the 
NH4
+ and NO3
− pool sizes at t0 and t24, the atom % 15N

− microbial con-
sumption and were also calculated; however, data are not 
presented because these rates greatly exceeded gross min-
eralization and nitriﬁcation, which can be an artifact of the 
15N isotope dilution technique in N-limited soils (Hart and 
Myrold 1996). Instead, we estimated gross NH4
+ assimila-
tion (gross NH4
+ consumption minus gross nitriﬁcation) to 
gain insights into microbial C and N limitations.

Statistical analyses
We assessed the effects of time-after-ﬁre on net N mineraliza-
tion and nitriﬁcation rates (in situ and laboratory) and initial 
pools of inorganic N (NH4
+ and NO3
− for July and Octo-
ber; where NO3
− levels were undetectable, we used half the 
lower detection limit, 0.03 mg N L−1) using linear regres-
sion in the burned patches (n = 7) and analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) with paired unburned patches as the covariate 
(n = 9 plots per patch). However, neither approach revealed 
signiﬁcant temporal trends in the data. Thus, we proceeded 
to analyze the effects of ﬁre using an ANOVA approach with 
each site considered a replicate (site = burned and unburned 
patch; n = 7 sites) and t tests to assess ﬁre effects within a 
site (n = 9 plots). In the latter analyses, we recognize that 
the plots within patches are not independent units, but felt 
the presentation of data patterns with inferential statistics 
was of unique and important value (Oksanen 2001). We then 
assessed changes in net N transformation rates, initial inor-
ganic N pool sizes, and ratios of net nitriﬁcation: net N min-
eralization over time-after-ﬁre using linear regression on the 
differences between the burned and unburned paired patches 
(burned − unburned; n = 7). This approach accounted for 
among-site variability and better isolated changes over time 
after ﬁre. Similarly, we assessed the effect of ﬁre on gross N 
production rates using ANOVA (n = 5 sites), and we analyzed 
differences (burned − unburned) over time after ﬁre using 
linear regression on gross N production rates and the ratios 
of gross nitriﬁcation: gross N mineralization. We examined 
ﬁre effects on the mineral soil characteristics (total C, total 
N, C:N, pH, and GWC) using one-way ANOVA on the patch 
means (n = 7 sites; pH was analyzed using the hydrogen ion 
concentration). Finally, we analyzed relationships among net 
(in situ) and gross N transformations and patch characteris-
tics (listed in Table 1; also average daily soil temperature for 
gross N transformations) using correlation analysis.
Residuals were visually inspected for each model, and 
data were transformed as necessary (natural log, square root) 
to meet the assumptions of ANOVA (normality and homoge-
neity of variance). Extreme outlier plot values in the net N 
transformation rates and inorganic N pools were identiﬁed as 
those greater than [the upper quartile + (3) × (interquartile 
range)] or less than [the lower quartile − (3) × (interquartile 
range)] and were excluded (approximately 1.0 % of the total 
collected data; Johnson et al. 2010). An a priori alpha level 
was set at 0.05. All statistical analyses were conducted using 
JMP statistical software (v.10.0.0; SAS Institute).
Results
Annual in situ net N mineralization rates in burned patches 
ranged from 3.03 to 6.56 g N m−2 years−1, which were 
lower (P < 0.01) than rates in unburned patches (4.35–
10.36 g N m−2 years−1; Fig. 1a). Annual net nitriﬁcation 
rates were higher in burned (1.98–3.51 g N m−2 years−1) 
than unburned (0.15–1.87 g N m−2 years−1) patches 
(P < 0.01; Fig. 1c). Net nitriﬁcation accounted for a 
greater proportion of net N mineralization in burned than 
unburned patches (mean net nitriﬁcation:net N minerali-
zation, burned patches = 0.65; unburned patches = 0.19; 
P < 0.01; Fig. 1e). We did not include the net N trans-
formation rates in the organic horizon at the unburned 
patches in the net N transformation rate estimates because 
most of the apparent net N cycling in the forest ﬂoor (net 
N mineralization: 0.36–1.0 g N m−2 years−1; net nitri-
ﬁcation: 0.09–0.27 g N m−2 years−1) was equivalent to 
the throughfall inputs estimated in burned areas (0.44–
1.44 g N m−2 years−1; data not shown). Excluding forest 
ﬂoor net N rates from the analysis did not alter overall pat-
terns between treatments and time-after-ﬁre.
Seasonal patterns of in situ net N mineralization and net 
nitriﬁcation rates in response to ﬁre were similar to those 
for annual rates, but effects were more pronounced during 
the monsoon season (Online Resources 1 and 2). Similarly, 
pools of inorganic N (NH4
+ and NO3
−) were higher in 
burned than unburned patches in July (P < 0.01 NH4
+ and 
P = 0.04 NO3
−; Table 2), but differences were less pro-
nounced in October (P = 0.01 NH4
+ and P = 0.11 NO3
−; 
Table 2).
The differences in annual in situ net N mineralization 
rates (burned − unburned) were not signiﬁcantly corre-
lated with time-after-ﬁre (R2 = 0.01, P = 0.80; Fig. 1b), 
nor were those for annual net nitriﬁcation rates (R2 = 0.17, 
P = 0.35; Fig. 1d) or the annual net nitriﬁcation:net N min-
eralization ratios (R2 = 0.15, P = 0.39; Fig. 1f). Trends 
were similar for seasonal rates of net N mineralization, net 
nitriﬁcation, and inorganic N pools (NH4
+ and NO3
−; data 
not shown).
Daily net N mineralization rates as estimated by the 
aerobic laboratory incubation did not differ between 
burned and unburned patches (11–183 mg N m−2 days−1 
unburned; 22–123 mg N m−2 days−1 burned; P = 0.31; 
Fig. 2a). Laboratory net nitriﬁcation rates were higher in 
burned (41–154 mg N m−2 days−1) than unburned (−2 to 
73 mg N m−2 days−1) patches (P < 0.01; Fig. 2b), but net 
nitriﬁcation:net N mineralization ratios were did not differ 
between burned (1.2–18.1) and unburned patches (0.13–
3.7; P = 0.10; Fig. 2c). The differences in laboratory net 
nitriﬁcation (burned − unburned) were negatively corre-
lated to time-after ﬁre (R2 = 0.80, P = 0.01), but those for 
net N mineralization and net nitriﬁcation : net N minerali-
zation ratios were not (R2 = 0.01, P = 0.87 and R2 = 0.32, 
P = 0.18, respectively; Online Resource 3).
Gross N mineralization rates did not differ between 
burned and unburned patches (7.3–86.0 mg N m−2 days−1

unburned, −25.5 to 79.4 mg N m−2 days−1 burned; 
P = 0.67; Fig. 3a). Gross nitriﬁcation rates were higher 
in burned patches (31.5–121.4 mg N m−2 days−1) than 
unburned patches (6.7–29.0 g N m−2 days−1; P < 0.01; 
Fig. 3b), as were the ratios of gross nitriﬁcation to 
gross N mineralization (P = 0.04; Fig. 3c), excluding 
the year 34 site, where the ratio could not be calculated 
because the gross N mineralization rate was very close 
to zero. The differences between burned and unburned 
rates of gross N mineralization and nitriﬁcation were 
not correlated with time-after-ﬁre (R2 = 0.22; P = 0.43; 
R2 = 0.01; P = 0.87, respectively; data not shown), nor 
were the differences in the ratio of gross nitriﬁcation rates 
to gross N mineralization (R2 = 0.68, P = 0.18; data not 
shown). Gross NH4
+ assimilation rates were higher in 
unburned patches than burned patches (P = 0.01; Online 
Resource 4).
Soil pH was higher in burned patches (5.53–5.81) 
than unburned patches (4.97–5.41; P < 0.01), and aver-
age daily soil temperatures over the 3.5-week period dur-
ing the monsoon season were approximately 4 °C warmer 
in burned than unburned soils (14.4 and 18.7 °C, respec-
tively; P < 0.01). Other mineral soil characteristics (total 
C and N; carbon-to-nitrogen mass ratio, and GWC) did 
not differ between burned and unburned patches. Organic 
horizon C, herbaceous C, aboveground live tree C, and 
soil pH were correlated to annual net N mineraliza-
tion (r = 0.82, P < 0.01; r = −0.71, P < 0.01; r = 0.77, 
P < 0.01; r = −0.69, P < 0.01, respectively) and nitriﬁca-
tion (r = −0.79, P < 0.01; r = 0.77, P < 0.01; r = −0.77, 
P < 0.01; r = 0.73, P < 0.01, respectively), while organic 
horizon, aboveground live tree C, and average daily soil 
temperature were correlated to gross nitriﬁcation rates 
(r = −0.73, P = 0.02; r = 0.74, P = 0.01; r = 0.73, 
P = 0.02, respectively). None of the variables were related 
to gross N mineralization rates.
Discussion
Stand-replacing wildﬁres had persistent, long-term effects 
on net and gross nitriﬁcation rates and inorganic N pools 
and, quite notably, all these components of N cycling 
lacked a signiﬁcant time-after-ﬁre trend over the course 
of more than three decades. Current knowledge of post-
ﬁre N cycling suggests that N availability is stimulated 
by ﬁre disturbance, but the effects are short term (Raison 
1979; Covington and Sackett 1992; Wan et al. 2001) and 
decline over the course of secondary succession (Vitousek 
et al. 1989). Based on this prior research, we hypothesized 
that net N transformations, inorganic N pools, and gross 
nitriﬁcation rates would gradually become similar to com-
parable unburned forest over time after ﬁre. Instead, our 
observations of elevated N availability and nitriﬁcation 
rates following stand-replacing wildﬁre in southwestern 
ponderosa pine forests indicate that this type of wildﬁre is 
not a “pulse” but rather a “press” type disturbance (i.e., a 
sustained alteration; Bender et al. 1984). High rates of nitri-
ﬁcation were sustained over time, and, as we predicted, the 
effects were more pronounced during the monsoon season, 
and nitriﬁcation comprised a greater proportion of net N 
mineralization in burned patches. Overall, these ﬁndings 
suggest that stand-replacing wildﬁres in these ecosystems 
trigger an N cycling state shift.
Shifts to alternative states are generally caused by sto-
chastic disturbance events that push an ecosystem beyond

a given threshold, and the alternative state is stabilized by 
a variety of feedback mechanisms (Scheffer et al. 2001). 
Contemporary perspectives on ecological resilience view it 
as the maximum amount of disturbance that an ecosystem 
can endure without pushing it into an alternative state, and 
management activities, such as ﬁre suppression, can inad-
vertently diminish resilience by reducing ecosystem diver-
sity in time and space (Holling 1973; Peterson et al. 1998). 
Southwestern ponderosa pine forests typify this model 
because management, including the introduction of cattle 
grazing and active ﬁre suppression, has had the unintended 
consequence of homogenizing these forests into dense 
stands of small-diameter trees, which are very susceptible 
to stand-replacing wildﬁres (Covington and Moore 1994). 
Effectively, human activities over the last ~100 years have 
reduced the ecological resilience of these forests; thus, ﬁre, 
which was previously an integral and renewing compo-
nent of the disturbance regime, is now an agent capable of 
pushing these forests into alternative stable states (Nyström 
et al. 2000; Savage et al. 2013). Our research suggests that 
stand-replacing wildﬁre disturbance in these ecosystems 
initiates a shift from low to high nitriﬁcation rates, and 
this shift may be reinforced by various biological (micro-
bial and plant communities), physical (soil temperature and 
presence of charcoal), and chemical (soil pH) feedbacks.
Changes in soil pH, temperature, and the presence of 
charcoal may be responsible for the prolonged maintenance 
of elevated nitriﬁcation rates in burned soils. Post-ﬁre 
increases in soil temperature and pH favor nitriﬁer activ-
ity (Christensen 1973; Bauhus et al. 1993); consistent with 
these previous ﬁndings, we observed positive correlations 
between net nitriﬁcation rates and soil pH and gross nitri-
ﬁcation rates and average daily soil temperatures. How-
ever, warmer soils in the burned patches are probably not 
the primary mechanism driving high nitriﬁcation rates, 
because we also observed high net nitriﬁcation in these 
soils under aerobic laboratory conditions. Nitriﬁcation can 
also be enhanced by ﬁre-produced charcoal (DeLuca and 
Sala 2006), either through the sorption of inhibitory phe-
nolic compounds (Zackrisson et al. 1996) or by increasing 
microbial activity (Pietikäinen et al. 2000).
Nitriﬁcation in burned soils may also be perpetuated by 
changes in the aboveground vegetation; in particular, the 
herbaceous vegetation that predominates recently burned 
areas (Laughlin et al. 2010). Post-ﬁre, microbial-medi-
ated ecosystem processes are thought to be driven by the

vegetation trajectory (Hart et al. 2005), and net N transfor-
mation rates tend to be higher in grass openings than under 
pine trees in southwestern ponderosa pine forests (Kaye and 
Hart 1998a). If burned sites become re-vegetated, we expect 
plants, especially trees, to compete more effectively for N 
against heterotrophic microbes (Johnson 1992). Although 
we observed a positive association between herbaceous 
C and net nitriﬁcation rates, herbaceous vegetation only 
accounted for a dominant portion of the total plant biomass 
at some of the recently burned patches (100 % at 7 and 
11 years-after-ﬁre; 26 % at 6 years-after-ﬁre; 3 % at 2 years-
after-ﬁre, which was dominated by one exceptionally large 
living tree), and it comprised only 2–5 % of the total plant 
biomass at the three oldest burns (Ross et al. 2012). This 
implies that the persistent post-ﬁre pulse of nitriﬁcation that 
we observed may not be entirely a grass-dependent con-
dition. Overall, low levels of live plant biomass in burned 
patches compared to unburned patches (Ross et al. 2012) 
suggests that low plant N uptake helps maintain post-ﬁre 
nitriﬁcation rates, and, indeed, high rates of net nitriﬁcation 
have been reported for unvegetated microsites in lodgepole 
pines forests (Metzger et al. 2008). Reduced NH4
+ uptake 
by plants would allow autotrophic nitrifying bacteria or 
archaea to better compete for NH4
+ substrate, thus  promot-
ing greater nitriﬁcation (Kaye and Hart 1997).
If the presence of grasses or low tree N uptake are mech-
anisms that maintain high nitriﬁcation in soils, then nitri-
ﬁcation may be maintained indeﬁnitely by the slow and 
unpredictable natural tree regeneration in these forests. 
Post-ﬁre vegetation trajectories in ponderosa pine forests 
are varied, including grassland, shrubland, or dense for-
est (Savage and Mast 2005; Roccaforte et al. 2012), and 
natural regeneration is limited by the need for a speciﬁc 
combination of seed production, weather conditions, and 
a favorable seedbed (Heidmann 2008). Cone production in 
ponderosa pine is enhanced by N fertilization (Heidmann 
1984), so it may be facilitated following wildﬁre. However, 
the widespread ﬁre-induced pine mortality would likely 
pose a signiﬁcant barrier to natural regeneration because 
conifer regeneration is most limited by the distance to the 
nearest seed-bearing tree (Bonnet et al. 2005). Addition-
ally, seedling establishment may depend on various other 
factors, including soil moisture conditions (Savage et al. 
2013), ﬁre severity (Crotteau et al. 2013), and speciﬁc myc-
orrhizal linkages (Booth and Hoeksema 2010).

Overall, pools of inorganic N were higher in burned than 
unburned patches. Although it is difﬁcult to directly resolve 
whether this due to higher gross production, reduced 
microbial consumption, or a combination of the two, the 
unburned patches had higher gross NH4
+ assimilation rates 
than the burned patches. This is presumably because greater 
C availability in the unburned patches led to greater NH4
+ 
assimilation. Consistent with this, previous work at these 
study sites documented lower labile C concentrations in the 
mineral soil of burned patches, such that soil CO2 efﬂux 
was lower in burned patches during the monsoon season 
(Ross et al. 2012). Also, in a similar forest type, Koyama 
et al. (2010) attributed higher NO3
− pools in burned soils 
to reduced microbial uptake, most likely due to C-limiting 
conditions produced by ﬁre (2 years previous). We suspect 
that persistent C limitations caused lower microbial assimi-
lation of NH4
+ in burned soils, thus increasing the avail-
ability of NH4
+ substrate for nitriﬁcation. This higher sub-
strate availability, coupled with lower plant N uptake, may 
offer nitriﬁers a competitive advantage in burned soils and 
lead to higher net and gross nitriﬁcation rates.
The high nitriﬁcation rates that we observed in burned 
patches are consistent with those found beneath herba-
ceous vegetation in similar forests that were restored to 
emulate presettlement structure (Kaye and Hart 1998a). 
This implies that stand-replacing wildﬁres may have 
caused nitriﬁcation to return to rates associated with the 
open canopy forest structure that prevailed under the 
presettlement, low-intensity surface ﬁre regime (Hart 
et al. 2005). The similarities in N cycling between cur-
rent burned forests and presettlement herbaceous patches 
argue that the elevated nitriﬁcation rates we observed may 
be stable over time. Over the long term, areas directly 
beneath trees may revert back to lower nitriﬁcation rates, 
as evidenced by the negative associations we observed 
between net and gross nitriﬁcation rates and live tree 
biomass and organic horizon C. However, it is unlikely 
that trees will regenerate to the same density as current 
unburned forests under future climate scenarios (Rocca-
forte et al. 2012), so it is likely that sustained nitriﬁcation 
rates will continue to persist.
We note that the ratios of nitriﬁcation:N mineraliza-
tion were generally higher for the laboratory-determined 
N transformation rates (gross and net) than those deter-
mined in situ. This may have resulted from using ﬁeld-
incubated, intact cores for the in situ measurements and 
sieved soils for the laboratory incubations. Nitrogen trans-
formation rates measured in mixed soils are not necessar-
ily representative of those in undisturbed soils (Booth et al. 
2006). In our study, sieving may have increased substrate 
(NH4
+) availability to nitriﬁers, and, thus, stimulated nitri-
ﬁcation rates to a higher degree in the laboratory-based 
measurements. This may also explain why rates of gross 
nitriﬁcation tended to be higher than those of gross N min-
eralization. In addition, we note that laboratory-based net 
rate estimates of N transformations were higher than those 
for gross rates. The use of air-dried soil for the net rates 
may have stimulated N transformations because soils were 
re-wetted to 60 % of their water holding capacity (to ~0.34 
GWC) prior to incubation, whereas ﬁeld moist soil (~0.25 
GWC) was used for gross rates. Thus, the two laboratory-
based measurements represent potentials of N transforma-
tions under different moisture histories.
Conclusions
The N cycling of southwestern ponderosa pine forests that 
historically experienced frequent, low-intensity surface 
ﬁres is fundamentally altered by the occurrence of stand-
replacing wildﬁres. Our net and gross N transformation 
rate measurements demonstrate a post-ﬁre increase in nitri-
ﬁcation that extends for more than three decades. These 
ﬁndings advance previous knowledge of ﬁre and ecosystem 
ecology by demonstrating that high nitriﬁcation rates are 
not necessarily a short-term response to ﬁre, nor are they 
entirely an herbaceous vegetation-dependent condition. We 
suggest that stand-replacing wildﬁre in southwestern pon-
derosa pine forests leads to an N cycling state shift, from 
low nitriﬁcation in unburned patches to high nitriﬁcation in 
burned patches. This biogeochemical state shift signiﬁes a 
“press” type disturbance that may be maintained by limited 
tree regeneration and the presence of herbaceous vegetation 
and ﬁre-deposited charcoal.
