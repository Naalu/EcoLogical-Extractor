Design of Regular Landscape Fuel
Treatment Patterns for Modifying
Fire Growth and Behavior
Mark A. Finney
ABSTRACT.  Patterns of disconnected fuel treatment patches that overlap in the heading fire spread
direction are theoretically effective in changing forward fire spread rate. The analysis presented here
sought to find the unit shape and pattern for a given level of treatment that has the maximum effect
on forward spread rate. This occurs when the treatment units cause the fire to spread through them
at the same rate as it spreads around them. Simulations suggested that these treatment patterns
reduce the spread rate or fireline intensity over much of the area burned, even outside the treatment
units where the fire was forced to flank. The ideal patterns are theoretically scale independent, allowing
for flexible application across heterogeneous landscapes. The topology of these patterns has
implications for designing landscape-level fuel treatment patterns and for understanding spatial
dynamics of fuel patterns across landscapes. FOR. SCI. 47(2):219–228.

T
HE GOAL OF FUEL MANAGEMENT IS to preemptively modify
wildfire behavior through changes to the fuel com-
plex. Fuel management has received increasing inter-
est for mitigating fuel hazards (U.S. Department of the
Interior and Department of Agriculture 1996, U.S. General
Accounting Office 1999), some of which were created by
nearly a century of fire suppression on millions of acres in the
western United States (Arno and Brown 1991). Fuel treat-
ments are intended to help limit wildland fire sizes and
severity by directly mitigating fire behavior and indirectly by
facilitating suppression. Prescribed burning and mechanical
thinning can lower fire spread rates and intensities within the
treated area (van Wagtendonk 1996, Helms 1979), at least
until fuels and vegetation reaccumulate. Fireline construc-
tion can be faster and more effective (fewer escapes) when
heavy concentrations of brush and logs are removed, and
spotting from torching trees is limited.
Treating all fuels across an entire landscape is practically
impossible, however. Limited funding, inadequate road ac-
cess, variable land ownership, and regulations often restrict
prescribed burning, smoke production, or timber harvesting.
Fuel management on a landscape scale tends to be limited in
the amount of a given treatment, location of treatments, and
the kinds of treatments permitted. Priorities for treatment are
often based on local hazards, ecological objectives, conve-
nience, cost, land ownership, or accessibility. These priori-
ties are not necessarily topological or spatial as is fire growth
and behavior and they do not prioritize the layout of treatment
units with an explicit consideration of fire growth among
adjacent units. With all the limitations on treatment location
and continuity of treatments across a landscape, it is logical
to address how the spatial arrangement of treatment units
affects fire growth.
Two basic strategies for landscape-level fuel management
are to contain fires and to modify fire behavior. Linear fuel
breaks (Agee et al. 2000, Weatherspoon and Skinner 1996)
have been proposed to help contain fires. Fuel breaks are
intended to reinforce defensible locations and facilitate sup-

pression action by indirect tactics including backfiring (Green
1977, Omi 1996). It is assumed that undesirable fire effects
are limited by reducing fire sizes. The fuel breaks themselves
are only burned along the zone of suppression, not by the fire.
By contrast, a spatial arrangement of treatments that prima-
rily modifies fire behavior would involve area-based or
dispersed patterns (Martin et al. 1989). Fire effects and
behaviors are modified wherever the fire encounters the
treatment units. Suppression is facilitated by allowing any
tactic (direct, indirect, or parallel attacks) to adapt to changes
in collective fire behavior.
For fire modification, it is clear that the greatest reduction
in fire size and severity occurs when fuel treatment units limit
fire spread in the heading direction. The heading portion of a
fire (moving with the wind or slope) has the fastest spread rate
and highest intensity compared to flanking and backing
portions (Catchpole et al. 1982). The heading fire also holds
the most potential for initiating crown fire and spotting,
which makes suppression much more difficult.
To disrupt the spread of the heading fire, there are three
basic geometric treatment patterns offering varying degrees
of overlap: complete, none, or partial (Figure 1). The case of
complete overlap by multiple treatments (Figure 1a) has the
effect of producing a harmonic mean spread rate among
multiple fuel types as the fire burns sequentially through the
strips (Fujioka 1985, Martin 1988):

where fi is the fraction of the total distance across the ith fuel
type having a characteristic spread rate ri. Here the effective
heading spread rate h is proportional to the time spent in each
fuel type; the fire must spread through the treatment strips
perpendicular to their orientation (e.g., no flanking). This
arrangement would rarely be practical for treating large and
variable landscapes. It would require extensive area to be
treated and continuous land ownership and access. By con-
trast, a treatment pattern with no overlap of the treatment
units (Figure 1b) may not change the forward spread rate
across the landscape; fire can burn unfettered through the
corridors between treatment blocks. A random or arbitrary
arrangement of treatments would closely resemble this pat-
tern because it has no requirement for producing overlap. It
would, however, be expected to yield increasing overlap in a
given direction as the treatment area or number of treatment
units increased. The effect of partial overlap (Figure 1c) on
fire growth is more complex because the fire must progress
through the pattern with a combination of forward and lateral
spread. This means that unit size, shape, orientation, and
juxtaposition to other units will strongly affect fire growth.
The topology will be general to heterogeneous landscapes
where fire is forced to progress among multiple fuel types.
Since a large number of unit configurations is possible, the
following analysis was directed to find a regular pattern of
treatments that produces the greatest reduction in overall fire
spread rate with a minimum of treated area.
Analysis
Fire shapes formed the basis for analyzing how flanking
and heading spread affected the progress of fire within a
mixture of fuel types. Shapes of wildland fires are known to
be ellipsoidal under homogeneous conditions of fuels, weather,
and topography (Van Wagner 1969, Anderson 1983,
Alexander 1985). The simple ellipse is the most common
shape used in modeling fire growth, and its dimensions are
assumed to depend mainly on wind and slope (Alexander
1985). For an elliptical fire, the rectangular expansion rates

center (Figure 2) can be obtained using spread rate compo-
nents (a, b, c) for the dimensions of length and breadth

The heading spread rate r is the sum b + c (θ = 0) because
c is the offset from the center of the ellipse to the ignition
point. The dimensions are parallel to the ground slope.
Stronger winds and steeper slopes produce more eccentric
fire shapes as described by the length to breadth ratio (Figure
2). The spread rates and intensities around the fire edge

major axis. Length to breadth ratio is b/a.

burned area (Catchpole et al. 1992) depend on fire shape. Fuel
type is often assumed to play little role in the shape of fires
(Anderson 1983) but greatly affects fire size because of
different intrinsic spread rates for given environmental con-
ditions. Thus, fuel treatments that only affect surface fuels
would mainly change fire spread rates and sizes but not
shapes. On forested lands, treatments often remove some of
the overstory trees to decrease horizontal and vertical crown
fuel continuity. This could produce faster windspeeds in the
understory as a result of a sparser canopy and thereby elon-
gate the fire spread pattern and increase spread rate to some
degree.
A main assumption of the following analysis is that
treatments effectively slow the fire spread rate. This is
expected, under most weather conditions, during the period
that forest and brush fuels are reduced after prescribed fire
and mechanical treatment. Burning reduces fuel loading,
depth, and continuity, and thus fire spread and intensity.
Thinning can limit the potential for fast-spreading crown
fires. This analysis assumes no spotting or acceleration of the
fire when spreading between fuel types and that fire shape is
the same in treated and untreated areas.
Shape of a Single Treatment Unit
A single treatment unit that reduces spread rate most
efficiently for the amount of area treated is one that will
just be burned completely as the fire simultaneously burns
through and circumvents the unit. Consider an elliptical
fire with dimensions a, b, c that spreads from a point at a
rate rm for a distance D in homogeneous fuels (Figure 3);
the smallest rectangular treatment unit with slower spread
rate rt that could block its path at a distance S from the
ignition point would allow the fire to spread forward a
distance W and laterally a distance L such that:

(8)
The length D is critical to the A, B, C dimensions of the fire
and thus, the L and W of the treatment units.
If this fire were to continue growing under constant
environmental conditions, it would flank to the left and
right edges of the treatment, turn the corners, and resume
spreading as two separate heading fires (Figure 4a). At the
same time, the fire would exit the lee side of the treatment
and also resume heading through the matrix. The fire
burning through the unit maintains a distance W ahead of
the fires that have flanked from around each side and thus,
a faster overall spread rate. The most efficient treatment
unit width W occurs when the fire exiting the lee of the unit
synchronously arrives at the same forward position as the
fires moving around the ends (Figure 4b) making the
spread rates equal. This was obtained by modifying Equa-
tion (8) to reduce the influence of W on L/2 in Equation (4):

Together, Equations (4)–(7) and (9) describe a rectan-
gular treatment unit that provides the maximum delay of
forward fire spread per unit area treated for a single point-
source fire igniting at a specific location outside the unit.
A wider unit does not stem the forward spread of the fire
because the fire flanks around it. A narrower unit burns
through before the fire flanks to its edges.
Regular Pattern of Overlapping Units
With slight modification, the analysis for a single treat-
ment unit [Equations (4)–(9)] can be extended to address
fire growth through a repeating regular pattern of identical
Figure 3.  Treatment unit dimensions W and L are a function of fire
shape and spread rates according to Equations (4)(5)(6)(7) and (8).

222

rectangular units across a landscape (e.g., the partial over-
lap pattern). Assuming that the fire burns steadily under
constant environmental conditions, the pattern consists of
parallel rows of units that overlap normal to the direction
of heading fire spread by a constant amount (Figure 1c).
The embedding of a single treatment unit in a regular
pattern of units changes the interpretation of the ignition
point in Equations (4)–(9) to a virtual point located at the
leeward corners of the previous units (Figure 5). These
corners become virtual point source ignitions because the
fire can make no lateral progress into the units that could
affect fire growth outside the units. Although a small
amount of flanking spread within the units does take place
before the heading fire reaching these corners (Figure
4a,b), it is irrelevant to fire shape or growth after fire
reaches these corners because of the faster flanking spread
in the matrix.
Once embedded in a repeating pattern, the width of
each unit serves a double purpose: it delays the head of the
fire while it flanks along the overlap formed with the unit
of the previous row, and then (in the opposite direction)
along the overlap with the units in the next row. Thus, with
two rows of overlap surrounding each unit, the effect of W
on O needs to be only half that described by Equation (9)
to produce the maximum delay of the fire:

Equations (5), (6), (7), (10), and (11) can now be used to
calculate O for a pattern of treatment units given the separa-
tion S from neighboring units, W of the unit itself, the fire
shape outside the unit, and spread rates inside and outside the
treatments. Equation (10) could also be rearranged to yield W

preted as the hypothetical forward spread distance of the fire

Together, Equations (5), (6), (7), (10), and (11) [or (12)
and (13)] describe the maximum reduction of forward fire
spread by rectangular treatment units per unit area treated. In
other words, these equations regulate fire growth so that the
fire spreads through the units in the pattern at the same rate as
Figure 4.  Fire spread rates through and around treatment units
will be (a) different using Equation (8), or (b) equal with Equation
(9).
Figure 5.  By embedding a single treatment unit in a regular
pattern of identical units, W delays fire growth during flanking
around two sides of the unit. The spread rate of the fire moving
around the units is, therefore, equivalent to the spread rate
through the units only if the effect of W on O is reduced by one-
half [Equation (10)]. Dashed lines indicate the hypothetical forward
spread distance D with no treatment.

it flanks around them. The equations do not depend on the fire
shape in the treatment, only the forward spread rate because
spread rate in the treatment is assumed slower.
The aggregate forward spread rate through the partial
overlap pattern is identical to a harmonic mean spread rate h1
calculated through the “thin” part of the pattern (e.g., not
through the overlapping portion of the treatments):

lated through the thick part of the pattern (e.g., through the
overlapping treatments):

(16)
As intended, the aggregate spread rate h1 in this regular
pattern is at a minimum when units are dimensioned per
Equations (5), (6), (7), (10), and (11) (Figure 6). It seems
counterintuitive, but increases or decreases in the width of the
units (holding constant all other dimensions) only increases
the aggregate spread rate through the pattern. A thicker W
[than indicated by Equation (12)] allows the fire to flank
around the units before they burn through and increases the
proportion of heading spread through the matrix fuels (be-
cause of the larger cross section of each unit). A thinner W or
smaller O [compared to Equation (11)] each permits the fire
to burn through before it is forced to flank around the units,
increasing the aggregate spread rate. Larger O produces no
change in h1 because the forward dimension of the pattern
remains the same (Figure 6), meaning no change in the
amount of heading spread within the pattern.
Both spread rates h1 and h2 converge on the harmonic
mean h calculated from Equation [1] using the fraction of area
treated T within the overlap pattern:

(17)
As S shrinks toward zero or O goes to L/2 the partial overlap
pattern approaches a series of parallel strips (Figure 1a) with
a harmonic mean spread rate h [Equation (1)]. This reinforces
the interpretation that the harmonic mean (Fujioka 1985,
Martin 1988) assumes fire spreads only in a single direction.
The proportions used in Equation (1) are nonspatial, referring
to both area and distance fractions of each fuel type.
It is clear that the separation distance S is critical to both
W and O. Increasing S raises the effective spread rate h1;
it also raises the treatment fraction T because W changes
with S [Equation (12)]. The choice of S is somewhat
arbitrary, however, within the range defined by the dimen-
sions of the treatment units. Its influence on O means that
S must be greater than zero but not so large that O becomes
longer than L/2.
Extension to Two Directions
With the parallel-linear arrangement of treatment units
above, S affects the treatment fraction (of the total landscape)
as well as the angles that gaps between the treatment units
align to make the pattern porous. A wind shift to these angles
would allow the fire to head through the gaps (pores) without
interruption by the treatment units. Obviously the pattern is
completely porous to heading fire spreading at an angle α =
π/2 relative to the direction normal to the treatments. But the
pattern is also porous to heading fire moving at specific
angles:

where n is any odd integer. Thus, the pattern will still overlap
at wider angles as L increases or S decreases, meaning a
greater tolerance for varying wind and fire spread directions.
Heading spread is blocked by the pattern for fires moving at

It is probably not possible to produce a treatment pattern that
has equal effects on fire growth in all directions because
Figure 6.  Independent changes to (a) the width of the treatments
(indicated by W*) or (b) the overlap of the treatments (indicated
by O*) relative to ideal dimensions [Equations (5), (6), (7), (10),
(11)] generally result in increased spread rates when S is held
constant. Thinner units (W*/W < 1.0) allow the fire to burn
through the units first. Thicker units (W*/W > 1.0) allow the fire
to first flank around the unit and head for a larger forward
distance through the faster matrix fuels. Smaller overlap (O*/O
< 1.0) produces faster spread rate h
1 as the fire burns around the
units before it burns through them. No change in spread rate is
produced for larger overlap (O*/O > 1.0) because it doesn’t
change the forward dimension of the treatment units (the amount
of matrix fuels burned in heading spread doesn’t change).

spread rates vary elliptically with direction. However, it is
possible to modify the parallel-linear treatment pattern to
eliminate porosity at all angles while keeping spread rate
reduced in a single heading direction according to Equations
(5)–(13). The modification involves slanting the treatments
by row, like louvered window blinds, in alternating direc-
tions by an angle β (Figure 7). This changes the dimensions
of the treatment units and how fire interacts with them.
The angle β determines the angle of an elliptical fire front
(as measured from the heading direction) that first contacts,
enters, and burns through a slanted treatment unit. The spread
rate of the fire in the slanted unit at that point (Catchpole et
al. 1982) is slower than rt:

This slower rt′ can be accommodated by the treatment pattern
in various ways. The easiest is to keep the cross-section W of
the units constant and allow rt′ to increase the overlap O of the
slanted units [Equation (10)]. The actual width of the slanted
units W′ however, must be reduced:

and their length L′ modified (Figure 7):

This keeps the lateral dimension of the treatment units equal
to L and accounts for the rotation of the right-angled corners.
Steeper slant angles β reduce the treatment fraction T of the
pattern because the treatment unit width W′ contributes a
greater amount to the lateral dimension of the units [Equation
(22)] and because the width of the units decreases. These
modifications also result in slight increases in the forward
spread rate h1 compared to the parallel arrangement.
As long as S < L, it will be possible to block the porous
angles by slanting the pattern alternately at some β. The

Simulations of fire growth through the various fuel pat-
terns were performed using the FARSITE model (Finney
1998) to examine their effects on fire growth and behavior.
The FARSITE model (Finney 1998) simulates fire growth for
complex conditions of terrain, fuels, and weather. FARSITE
assumes a perfect elliptical fire under uniform conditions
with the ignition located at the rear focus of the ellipse
(Alexander 1985). It was therefore suited to testing the
relationships developed here. The simulations were simpli-
fied to maintain constant weather, fuel moistures, and wind
direction with the only variation coming from fuel patterns
and types. For each simulation, two ignition points were
located at the lee corners of the treatment units to form
symmetric fire growth patterns and to meet the assumptions
that the fire is growing steadily among the units.
Results
By relating the dimensions of the treatment units (L and
W) to their juxtaposition on the landscape (S and O), the
concept of fuel treatments is expanded topologically to ad-
dress arrangement and efficiency of treatment area. It links
the effect of one treatment to its neighbors through the
dimensions of fire shape and spread rate. Thus, for a specified
amount or fraction of treatment area and fire dimensions,
there will be an arrangement of identical fuel treatment units
that satisfies the above conditions for unit shape, separation,
and overlap and produces the maximum spread rate reduction
for the area treated.
These relationships permit a depiction of tradeoffs be-
tween intensive and extensive treatment strategies (Figure 8).
As the relative spread rate due to treatment (rt/rm) decreases,
the fraction of the landscape requiring treatment decreases (at
a given spread rate h1 through the pattern). For example, at a
constant S for a fire with a length to breadth ratio of 2.0, an
effective spread rate of 60% of the untreated condition could
be achieved by treating 20%, 10%, or 7% of the landscape
depending on spread rate in the treatments of 1/5th, 1/10th, or
1/20th of the matrix. A comparison of spread rates for a
constant treatment level, say 20% of the landscape, reveals
effective spread rates of 60%, 40%, and 25% of the untreated
condition depending on the relative spread rate in the treated
areas.
The treatment patterns tested with FARSITE simulations
each had about 19% of the area treated and produced spread
rates that were consistent with Equations (1) and (15) with rt/
rm = 0.1 (Figure 9). Spread rate maps from the simulations
Figure 7.  The parallel treatment pattern (open rectangles) can be
louvered (shaded rectangles) at an angle β to block porous angles
α through the pattern. The dimensions O and L must be increased
and W decreased to keep fire spread through the slanted units at
the same rate as it spreads around them [Equations (20)–(22)].

showed that the partial overlap patterns split the regions of
heading spread rates (Figure 9a) into multiple smaller regions
(Figure 9c, 9d). The frequency distribution of spread rates or
fireline intensities for elliptical fires burning under homoge-
neous conditions varies by fire shape (Catchpole et al. 1992).
The simulations showed that the complete and partial overlap
patterns shifted the mode of this spread rate distribution from
the right side of the range to the left side of the range (Figure
10). These slower spread rates occurred directly within the
treated areas and in the matrix fuels between the overlapping
regions of the treatments where the fire was forced to flank.
The overlapping regions occur outside the actual treatment
unit as a lee-side effect of the overlap between treatments
(Figure 10), meaning reduced spread rates and intensities for
more of the landscape than was physically treated.
Discussion
The analysis presented here showed that there is an ideal
pattern of overlapping units that efficiently reduces the ag-
gregated fire spread rate per area treated. Simulations sug-
gested that the spread rates within the burned areas should
also be reduced, even outside the treatments, where the fire is
forced to flank around the units within the regions of overlap
O. This implies that fire effects on a landscape basis such as
crown scorch and tree mortality which depend on fireline
intensity could be ameliorated by these patterns to a greater
extent than the immediate areas receiving treatment. Fireline
intensity is proportional to spread rate for a given fuel type
(Byram 1959). Furthermore, the overlapping treatment pat-
terns would fragment the most extreme fire effects into
smaller patches because the heading fire is split by the
treatment units. To increase the area burned by flanking fire,
the amount of overlap O must be increased, which requires a
larger fraction of the landscape to be treated. Further analysis
of these patterns may suggest ways to specifically improve
these benefits.
The assumptions for this analysis suppose a restrictive set
of conditions that are unlikely to be completely met for a
given fire or landscape. Treatments in some vegetation types
can actually produce increases in fire spread rates over time
if burning and harvesting encourage the growth of fine fuels
and understory vegetation. Nevertheless, much evidence
from natural fire regimes suggests that spread rates after
treatment do decrease until fuels accumulate and vegetation
regrows. Wildfires burning into treated areas exhibited de-
creased intensities and spread rates (Helms 1979, Martin et
al. 1989) and caused less mortality (Wagle and Eakle 1979,
Martin et al. 1989). The patchwork of free-burning fires at
Yosemite National Park and Sequoia and Kings Canyon
National Parks showed fire slowing and stopping along
boundaries of previously burned areas (van Wagtendonk
1995, Parsons and van Wagtendonk 1996). Frequent chapar-
ral fires in Baja California were kept small by the fine-scale
pattern of recent burns, but infrequent large fires burned
across more homogeneous chaparral landscapes in the United
States (Minnich and Chou 1997). Weight of fine dead fuels
were found to accumulate to preburn levels within 7 yr of
prescribed burning (van Wagtendonk and Sydoriak 1987).
Even with faster spread rates, the benefits of fuel manage-
ment would be seen in reduced fire damage to the forest and
improved controllability (i.e., grass fires are easier to control
than crown fires in timber types because of lower intensity
and reduced spotting).
Spotting was excluded from this analysis but would likely
result in large fires, independently of any landscape fuel
pattern except wholesale treatment. Assuming that the treat-
ment pattern is extensive, each spot fire would be subjected
to the same maze of slow burning treatments that impedes the
growth of the main fire. Also, treatments designed to restrict
the availability of crown fuels would locally limit the produc-
tion of new embers from the treated areas, probably reducing
spotting. Spotting amidst this kind of treatment pattern would
likely produce “intensity shadows” on the lee side of the
treatments similar to those observed by (Heinselman 1996) in
the Boundary Waters Canoe Area. There, natural lakes dis-
rupted fire growth so that fire reached the windward shores
only by spotting; spot fires produced lower intensities until
they coalesced and resumed burning as a broad fire front.
Fire suppression was excluded from the analysis but could
certainly be expected to benefit from the influences of slower
fire growth rate and the frequent presence of treatment units
near the fire that both speed line construction and moderate
fire behavior. For any fire suppression activity to directly use
the treatments, the tactics would need to be adjusted to reflect
an awareness of unit locations and their consequences to fire
behavior and safety.
Although treatments would not be as visually apparent as
illustrated here unless the overstory was heavily thinned, the
idealized and artificial treatment patterns would probably never
be achievable or even desirable in practice. Management activi-
ties on a landscape are typically arranged to satisfy other more
compelling needs such as timber harvest volume, water quality,
Figure 8.  Relative fire spread rate in relation to the fraction of
landscape treated for fires with a length to breadth ratio of 2.0.
Three levels of treatment are defined by the spread rate in the
treatment (rt) relative to the matrix (rm). Thick lines are the
harmonic mean spread rate [h: Equation (1)]. Thin lines are the
spread rate h1 [Equation (15)] of the overlapped pattern with
variation due to S. Smaller S produces lower relative spread rates
and treatment fractions. Greater overlap O increases the treatment
fraction and lowers the relative spread rate.

Figure 9.  Fire growth and spread rate patterns simulated using FARSITE with various treatment patterns. The
relative spread rate in the treated areas (blue) is 1/10th of that in the matrix (yellow). All treatments occupy about
19% of the area. Homogeneous conditions (a) produce a relative forward spread rate of 1.0 for comparison with (b)
complete overlap of treatment strips that produce a harmonic mean h of 0.41 [Equation (1)], (c) partial overlap with
mean spread rate h1 of 0.43, and (d) slanted partial overlap with harmonic mean h1 of 0.49. See Figure 10 for
distributions of spread rates within the burned areas.
wildlife issues, and so on. However, a number of the relation-
ships developed here have the potential for practical application
to strategic planning of landscape-level fuel management pro-
grams. It is possible that some of the topological considerations
of this analysis could be incorporated into the planning and
layout of actual treatments without upsetting the existing priori-
ties. This could produce a value-added modification of wildland
fire growth and behavior for little extra effort. The primary
considerations are:
➤Treatment units need to overlap in an anticipated heading
spread direction.
➤The pattern should target fires burning under specific
weather and fuel moisture conditions because of their
characteristic sizes and spread rates under that environ-
ment.
➤The relationship between separation and overlap must
consider the expected fire shape and relative spread rates
in the treated areas.
➤Separation must be small compared to the fire sizes.
➤There is a tradeoff in the amount of treatment and the
intensity of the treatment prescription.
The size of the treatment pattern is theoretically scale-
independent. That is, the actual sizes of the treatment units
(and dimensions O, S) are only relative to each other. The
pattern can thus be adapted to localized spatial constraints
and variability across a landscape. In practice, the scale of
the pattern could not be coarser than the size of fires for the
pattern to have any effect on a real fire. The distance of S
would need to be considerably shorter than the forward
dimension of the fire. Coarse patterns with long S could
allow a fire to burn mostly without influence of the treat-
ments (e.g., within the untreated space between treatment
units). Pattern dimensions would probably need to be
between 101 and 103 m to be involved in most fires. The
expected spotting distance for the targeted weather condi-
tions would also be an important consideration for unit
width (W).

The dependency on fire sizes and shapes indicates that
the patterns would need to target fires that burn under a
specific set of weather conditions. For example, fuel
moisture and wind conditions associated with the histori-
cal 90th percentile level of fire danger indices (Andrews
and Bradshaw 1997) provide information on the relative
spread rates in different fuel types and fire shapes. Very
often, large fires in a given area are oriented along a
particular axis (e.g., generally west to east) determined by
the direction of episodic wind events, like cold fronts.
Fires burning under more mild weather conditions are less
affected by the spatial treatment pattern because fires are
smaller, and because the relative spread rates in the treated
and untreated fuels become more similar as burning con-
ditions moderate. The pattern of fuel treatments would
have less utility to suppression under moderate conditions
because suppression efforts are already effective, and
under “worst case” conditions because suppression efforts
are largely ineffective anyway. Individual treatment units
would be expected to mitigate fire effects within the units
under a broad range of weather.
The uncertainty and variability in burning conditions
associated with a fire or fire weather suggests that some
dimensions of the treatment pattern would probably need
to be larger to afford greater latitude in effectiveness than
determined strictly by the theory. The sensitivity analysis
[Figure (6)] suggests that overall spread rate (h1) is not
penalized by increasing the overlap of the treatment units.
Although larger area must be treated, larger overlap pro-
vides some buffer against the variability in fire shape and
changing wind direction. Treatment width would also
need to account for anticipated changes in fuel structure of
treated areas over time.
The effects of fuel treatments on fire behavior are only
temporary. More research is needed on fuel accumulation
and long-term changes in fuel-bed structure. This will
influence the longevity of individual treatments that would
dictate both the schedule for creating the initial pattern and
the cycle of maintaining existing units. It would also
determine the scheduling of new patches that could be
inserted into an existing pattern. The problem of how to
maintain the topology of a landscape-level effect on fire as
fuel patches age across both space and time is very chal-
lenging. Perhaps some pattern can be devised that ac-
counts for the temporal changes in local spread rates by
adjusting both the treatment dimensions and the timing
and location of new treatments within the pattern.
This analysis was developed for the simplest of condi-
tions, namely having only two fuel types and a single wind
direction. However, because the above relationships are
essentially scale independent, they should also apply to
heterogeneous conditions where spread rates and maxi-
mum spread directions all vary. This will be the subject of
continuing work but might be approached by reducing the
complexity of the landscape to several maps. The main
maps would need to be horizontal fire spread rate in the
direction of interest, elliptical dimensions of the fire, and
direction of maximum spread. Areas with homogeneous
characteristics (within some tolerance) can then be delin-
eated and analyzed separately. Some modification of the
existing equations would then be needed to dimension the
pattern along the boundaries of homogeneous areas. Un-
derstanding the role that treatment unit size, shape, and
placement play in modifying fire growth and behavior will
allow managers to employ fuel treatments in an efficient
and effective manner.
