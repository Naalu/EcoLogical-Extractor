The Ecological Restoration Institute
The Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University is
a pioneer in researching, implementing, and monitoring ecological
restoration of southwestern ponderosa pine forests. These forests
have been significantly altered over the last century, with decreased
ecological and recreational values, near-elimination of natural
low-intensity fire regimes, and greatly increased risk of large-scale
fires. The ERI is working with public agencies and other partners to
restore these forests to a more ecologically healthy condition and
trajectory in
the process helping to significantly reduce the threat
of catastrophic wildfire and its effects on human, animal, and plant
communities.
The Program in Restoration Policy at the ERI strives to connect the
ecological aspects of restoration with wider social and policy issues.
The Program conducts a variety of social science research and
outreach activities guided by the explicit assumption that ecological
restoration and ecological sustainability are intricately linked to
human community, society, and democratic processes. Please contact

The 2000 and 2002 fire seasons resulted in increased political scrutiny of the nation’s
wildland fire threats, and given the fact that millions of acres of lands are still at high risk
for future catastrophic fire events, the issues highlighted by the recent fire seasons are not
likely to go away any time soon. Recognizing the magnitude of the problem, the Na-
tional Fire Plan outlined a cooperative long-term program of research and development
to support efforts to reduce human and ecological losses from wildfire. For example, in
Fiscal Year 2001, USDA Forest Service scientists received $26 million for 63 research
projects, including many projects that would apply the theories and methodologies of the
social sciences to critical wildfire issues; an additional 15 projects were funded in Fiscal
Year 2002. Forest Service scientists, in turn, brought in cooperators from universities and
non-governmental organizations across the country to collaborate on projects focusing on
issues related to firefighting, rehabilitation and restoration, hazardous fuel reduction, and
community assistance. The large infusion of fire research dollars has provided the re-
sources and incentives for social scientists to address questions of humans interactions
with fire—pre, during and post fire events. Other activities in support of fire social
science include the National Wildfire Coordinating Group’s establishment of a social
science research task group, and sponsorship of Burning Questions, a social science re-
search agenda on fire (Machlis et al. 2002).
The increased interest of social science researchers in exploring the human dimen-
sions of fire was clearly evident at the June 2002 International Symposium on Society
and Resource Management (ISSRM) held in Bloomington, Indiana. Only a few years
earlier there would have been only a few isolated researchers working on fire-related
issues. However, when Pam Jakes of the Forest Service North Central Station organized a
breakfast meeting for fire researchers, the room was filled.
Don Field of the University of Wisconsin and Hanna Cortner of Northern Arizona
University embraced the heightened research interest in fire, but also noted that along
with the unprecedented opportunities being afforded social scientists, there was also the
danger that these opportunities could be squandered if the resulting social science did not
have direct and immediate application for fire managers and policy makers. Ecological
fire researchers have had a much longer period of time to accumulate a body of knowl-
edge, and to weave a potent story about the adverse ecological impacts of past fire sup-
pression policies and the need for an active program of fuels reduction and ecological

restoration. But what are the stories social scientists could cogently tell? What if, Don
and Hanna discussed, after all the new fire research dollars and the infusion of new re-
searcher enthusiasm, the end results were a bunch of highly reductionist studies—signifi-
cant perhaps by themselves or contributing to the growth of social science theory—but
with minimal cumulative impact and utility for managers and policy makers? Would
there be a significant second chance?
Don and Hanna agreed that there was a critical need to convene social scientists
working on fire-related questions and to continue the networking and sharing Pam’s
breakfast had initiated. Social scientists needed an opportunity to share research results,
address explicitly the “so what” question in terms of their research, identify further col-
laborative opportunities, focus on maximizing social science results on management and
policy making, and just have more time to talk to one another. Don and Hanna ap-
proached Pam about organizing such a workshop within the next six months. Pam
readily agreed, and our joint workshop planning effort was underway.
Tradeoffs had to be made in designing the workshop since human/environment
issues in fire are not bounded simply, and there are multiple entry points for social
science research in the countless facets of fire issues. Cognizant of the somewhat arbitrary
decisions being made, we decided to organize workshop discussions and information
sharing among five areas: 1) individuals; 2) communities; 3) fire across the gradient; 4)
culture/ethnicity, and 5) policy, political, and institutional. We recognized that the price
of focused informal discussions was a more inclusive topic agenda. In addition, rather
than inviting individual researchers to give a series of papers, we also decided to only
invite five short papers focused on the theme topics, two short responses from a manage-
rial and a policy perspective, and a wrap-up “on-the-spot” synthesis presentation. The
rest of the workshop time would be devoted to small group breakouts and full group dis-
cussions. The subtitle of the workshop, “Social Science Applied to Fire Management”
was chosen deliberately to focus discussions on synthesis and the utility of fire-related
social science for applied policy and problem solving.
This summary of the January 26-28, 2003 workshop held in Tucson, Arizona, pres-
ents the record of the meeting. It includes the full text of the invited theme papers, the
managerial and policy talks, annotated outlines of the breakout sessions and the closing,
wrap-up presentation. It also includes a reflective “after-the-workshop” summary and
synthesis paper. This record, however, is only one product of the meeting. In addition to
the networking that occurred, researchers attending the workshop also committed to
several on-going activities designed both to foster communications among scholars as
well as to maximize the utility of social science research applied to fire management. Ex-
amples of such activities include: preparation of a social science expertise directory, devel-
opment of a research framework to demonstrate how various work nodes are relating to
one another and where there are still significant gaps, and planning for sessions at the
July 2003 Natural Hazards workshop in Boulder, Colorado, and the 2004 ISSRM con-
ference in Keystone, Colorado.

Building a community of scholars working in fire will help individuals and commu-
nities of place build the social capital needed to anticipate or recover from fire events as
well as foster institutional arrangements that build and sustain civic societies. The politi-
cal feasibility of policies is dependent upon broader public conceptions of the fire
problem, and public willingness to commit taxpayer dollars to fire prevention, fire sup-
pression, and rehabilitation when there is any number of competing high priority policy
problems. Basic fire fighter safety is also dependent upon knowledge of risk and the
factors—from policies to individual motivations—that affect decisions. Just as policies
must be sensitive to different ecological circumstances, they must also be sensitive to
these factors as well as differences in culture, ethnicity and community. A coherent body
of scientific social science knowledge has much to contribute to those who must weave a
variety of informational sources and value systems into the decisions that will affect the
relationships between fire, humans and forests.

Social Science of Wildfire Risk Management: Individual Level of Analysis
Terry C. Daniel
University of Arizona
Wildfire is not naturally a hazard. Fires have burned for centuries and are an essential
component of many ecosystems. Fires have become a “natural hazard” because
modern humans and the things they value often get in the way. Wildfire risk is
defined by the likelihood of damage to, or loss of, things human inhabitants, visitors
or “owners” care about. Wildfires have historically caused loss of human life,
damaged developed property, and disturbed or destroyed features of natural environ-
ments and ecological processes that people value. Rapid expansion of human devel-
opment into previously wild lands—the wildland-urban interface—has raised
wildfire risk to unprecedented levels.
Human societies in fire-prone environments have little choice but to manage
wildfire risk. Ironically, modern humans’ enthusiastic application of highly devel-
oped fire prevention and fire suppression capabilities over the last century has exacer-
bated the wildfire problem. By reducing fire ignitions and by controlling the size of
fires, extremely large volumes of combustible vegetative fuels have accumulated in
many areas. Naturally fire-adapted ecosystems that would normally have burned fre-
quently at low intensity are now more likely to burn with very high intensities,
making fires much more difficult to control and more likely to cause greater damage.
The level of wildfire risk is determined by the value and vulnerability of the
values-at-risk, in association with an array of interrelated environmental hazard
factors. Some hazard factors are relatively stable and chronic, such as the fire propen-
sity of the ecological setting, climate and weather patterns and topography. Other
factors are more variable and critical, such as wind speed and direction, and the
types, loads, distributions and moisture content of vegetative fuels. Together these
hazard factors determine the likelihood and the “behavior” of a serious wildfire, in-
cluding fire intensity, rate of spread and extent of burn. Modern wildfire risk man-
agement is a complex technical process that integrates pre-, during-, and after-fire
actions, including development regulations and zoning, public awareness and educa-
tion programs, mitigation efforts, warning systems, emergency action plans, protec-
tion/suppression resources and deployment, incident command and management,
insurance, post-disaster relief, and rehabilitation. The scale of risk management ac-
tivities ranges from local at-risk sites (e.g., fire retardant construction materials for
individual homes) to adjacent areas (e.g., fuel breaks in “buffer areas” around com-
munities or recreation sites) to regional scale projects (e.g., landscape-scale fuel re-
duction programs).

Wildfire and social science ______________________________________________________
Much of the technology of wildfire risk management rests on relevant biological and
physical (“fire”) sciences, but social sciences can and have contributed substantially.
Indeed, wildfire risk is a human-social problem. The values-at-risk are defined by people.
Risk management options must be accepted by people locally and, especially where
public lands are involved, nationally. Many components of risk management programs
require action by local communities and by individual property owners. This paper pres-
ents some social science perspectives on wildfire hazard and wildfire risk management, fo-
cusing especially on efforts to implement fuels management programs under the National
Fire Plan. The social sciences relevant to fire risk management range from the broadest
cultural levels (e.g., history of human-fire relationships over the landscape) to social/polit-
ical systems (e.g., land-development policies and the network of laws and regulations that
enable and constrain risk management actions) to communities (e.g., adoption of
fire-safe/fire-wise programs) to the behavior of individuals (e.g., decisions by residents to
implement risk reduction actions on their own properties). All levels of analysis are neces-
sary and important and ideally the social science of wildfire risk management would be
fully and formally integrated, with each level of analysis drawing from and contributing
to findings and principles at the other levels to provide the most effective possible
support to the urgent task of reducing wildfire hazard and the associated human losses.
This paper will focus on wildfire risk relevant perceptions, values and actions by individ-
uals based on research, theory and methods from the discipline of psychology.
Psychological perspectives ______________________________________________________
Historically wildfire risk management efforts have emphasized fire prevention, with the
goal of reducing the incidence of fire ignitions. When fire prevention fails, the risk man-
agement strategy traditionally has shifted to aggressive quasi-military campaigns to
control the fire and reduce the extent and severity of damage. Fire risk management poli-
cies have more recently begun to show increased sensitivity to the natural, perhaps inevi-
table role of fire in forests and other fire-prone ecosystems. Increasingly, the
professionally preferred management strategy is to preemptively control the intensity and
magnitude of wildfires by altering the volume and distribution of the vegetation that
fuels the fire. This shift in risk management emphasis is well founded in bio-ecological
and physical fire science, but it also has important psychological implications that can
affect public acceptance, support and cooperation.
Prevention—Wildfire prevention focuses on the probability component of the risk
equation, seeking to reduce the likelihood of fire ignitions. Most closely associated with
the “Smokey Bear” campaign, wildfire prevention policies have been highly successful (by
some accounts, too successful). Images of beautiful green forests engulfed in flames, terri-
fied wildlife running for their lives and visions of the charred aftermath of high intensity
wildfires readily motivated high levels of public support for and compliance with fire

ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
11
prevention policies. No self-respecting member of society would purposefully, or even
carelessly start a forest fire. From a psychological perspective, attaining strong public
support for fire prevention should be easy. First, the stated goal of fire prevention is to
keep things the way they are—to maintain the status quo, without fire. Second, Smokey’s
admonitions (e.g., don’t toss lighted matches into the woods) are, on the face of it, very
reasonable and compliance requires little effort and little or no compromise of life style or
desired environmental conditions.
Suppression—All out attacks on raging wildfires, characterized as threatening human
lives and property, destroying beautiful natural forests and killing helpless wildlife, easily
garner high levels of public support. The very plausible goal of fire suppression is to
protect what we have by getting rid of the fire that threatens it. Support is further rein-
forced by dramatic media coverage of heroic fire fighters waging war against fires in the
air and on the ground. Another psychologically appealing feature is that no action is re-
quired until a fire is undeniably burning, i.e., there is little (apparent) uncertainty about
when and where to implement the policy. While fire suppression operations are notori-
ously expensive and frequently dangerous (firefighters are the most likely human fatalities
in a wildfire), the need for fighting fires is rarely questioned. What is demanded of the
average citizen is to cheer on heroic firefighters from the safe sidelines and, in the fine
print, to (indirectly) pay the substantial financial costs—costs which can in part be justi-
fied by claims of the number of houses or the acres of forest that would have burned had
the fire not been controlled.
Fuel reduction—The strategy of mitigating wildfire risk by preemptively reducing
fuels, by comparison to prevention or suppression, presents a more complex and prob-
lematic psychological profile. Fuel treatments must be implemented well in advance of
any wildfire, requiring people to accept immediate changes in their environment to
protect against an uncertain threat in the future. Treatment options are neither as logi-
cally compelling nor as clearly justified as prevention and suppression actions. Removing
flammable vegetation can readily be translated as “cutting the forest to keep it from
burning,” seemingly defeating the purpose. Further, a public assumption not readily ex-
pelled is that cutting in the forest for whatever purposes will produce a less aesthetic, less
“natural” landscape. Moreover, “mechanical treatments” are rather too similar in means
and ends to commercial timber management activities that have historically had consid-
erable negative connotations. Indeed, some have voiced the concern that fuels treatment
programs have ulterior (economic) motives, a suspicion that drives “diameter cap” con-
troversies and is reinforced by the fact that “timber sale” mechanisms are often relied on
for financing and implementing treatments. The alternative of reducing fuels by con-
trolled burning (“burning the forest to keep it from burning”) also conjures up less than
appealing landscape images, and fire is still not completely accepted as a potentially be-
nevolent natural process. Further, the highly publicized instances where the “control” part
of the burning was not fully achieved have added to the uncertainty, and made some
wonder whether the cure is more dangerous than the disease.
In addition to being implemented in advance, to be effective fuel reduction treat-
ments must be repeated and maintained at least until the fire occurs. Thus, any adverse

Humans, Fires, and Forests
12
effects on aesthetic or naturalness values will be immediate, and must be endured essen-
tially forever. The perceived, and largely preferred status quo must be abandoned in favor
of a continuous pattern of change as fuels are removed, re-accumulate and then get
removed again, ad infinitum. In contrast, any gains in safety or reduced losses (which are
only probabilistic, not guaranteed) cannot be realized at all until and unless a wildfire ac-
tually occurs. Tradeoff equations with such pay-now, get-benefits-later-maybe parameters
do not have a history of being favored by large numbers of people.
Defining success—The effects of wildfire are typically reported to the public in terms
of the number of ignitions and the area burned and, where relevant, the number of struc-
tures damaged or destroyed. There are a number of reasons to question the importance
placed on structures (e.g., protecting structures may demand suppression resources that
might better have been used to control the fire, and structures are generally covered by
private insurance). Post-fire surveys suggest that even directly affected residents express
often more concern about environmental damage than the loss of structures (“What
good is a cabin in the woods without the woods?”). The reporting of area burned can be
deceiving, as not all of the reported area is burned to the same degree—a mosaic of
“hotter” and “cooler” spots is typical of large fires.
Paradoxically, a truly successful fuel reduction risk management strategy is unlikely
to reduce fire starts (indeed, ignitions might increase in some areas to more closely ap-
proximate natural fire intervals), and might well result in larger burned areas (with lower,
more natural intensities there would be less need for all out efforts to control and restrict
fires). Rather than promising to avoid or get rid of fire, the fuel reduction strategy is
predicated on accepting fire as a natural and recurring part of living in the wildland-
urban interface. While there may be very compelling safety (and ecological and perhaps
even economic) arguments for pursuing this risk management strategy, it is not likely to
bring psychological comfort to wildland-urban residents and visitors, or to important na-
tional constituencies. Changing public perceptions of fire in the woods is an ongoing
process, in which the way wildfire effects are communicated to the public can be very in-
fluential. If fire communications are not carefully crafted, there is a danger that a success-
ful fuel reduction strategy could be perceived by the public as a failure.
Selling the fuel reduction strategy _____________________________________________
Accomplishing national fuel-reduction goals will require intense involvement and signifi-
cant cost sharing from affected local communities, as well as sustained national support
from taxpayers with a full and expanding agenda of other pressing problems. There are
numerous psychological reasons (discussed above) to expect that securing and sustaining
the required public support could be extremely difficult. Current enthusiasm for “pro-
tecting homes” in communities that were actually or symbolically “scorched” by the
recent fires will likely fade with time and wetter conditions. Nearly unanimous support
for abstract public safety and environmental protection goals will increasingly be chal-
lenged by the very specific reality of cutting and removing and/or burning large volumes

ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
13
of “natural” vegetation from cherished and often very visible places. Whether the means
of removal is mechanical, prescribed burning or some combination, there will be real and
sometimes substantial environmental, economic and social costs. Given current condi-
tions at the highest priority sites, treatments sufficient to provide significant hazard re-
duction will not be subtle and, at least in the short term, the effects are likely to be
perceived by the public as quite negative. Sustained public support for the fuel reduction
program will hinge on whether the immediate and recurring environmental, economic
and social costs of treatments are perceived to be favorably balanced by expected
fire-safety benefits.
It may be safe to assume a continuing, generally high level of public support for the
generic goal of reducing wildfire hazard, both to protect fire fighter’s lives and private
property and to protect public natural environments and resources. Public support for
“mechanical treatments” to reduce hazardous fuels has been found in several recent
surveys. However, fuel treatments are not generic; they must be carried out in particular
ways at particular times and particular places. The nature of treatments and their effects
depends importantly on the specific vegetation/fuel type and condition and on details of
the treatment prescription and the means of implementation. Moreover, each treatment
has a particular temporal trajectory, with differing patterns of effects over the treatment
to post-treatment to re-treatment cycle. It is important that public involvement programs
adequately and effectively communicate the full set of value tradeoffs that proposed fuels
treatments entail. Just as wildland managers need reliable assessments of existing fuel con-
ditions and valid projections of the biological and fire behavior effects of treatments, they
also need to effectively communicate these conditions and expected outcomes to affected
publics and to obtain accurate and valid assessments of public response. Vague, incom-
plete or glossed over representations of treatment effects and exaggerated expectations of
safety benefits could jeopardize the sustained public support needed for success of the na-
tional program.
Communicating with publics—First, environmental/wildfire managers should get
their story straight. That is, they must have reasonable confidence in their assessments of
current hazard conditions and of the environmental impacts and safety improvements
that can be expected from fuel treatment alternatives being considered. Under the best of
circumstances, the fuel reduction risk management strategy is complex, and poses a
number of significant psychological challenges. Public resistance can be expected to any
change in the status quo, especially when current conditions are perceived, accurately or
not, as “natural.” There is considerable and unavoidable uncertainty in the outcomes of
any fuel management treatment, over time and from site to site, and no reasonably con-
templated treatments can promise absolute protection from wildfire. Even if managers are
secure in their facts and are able to present compelling evidence of the long-term benefits
of fuel treatments, it cannot be assumed that all people will find the expected benefits
sufficient to cover the perceived short-term costs. Reasonable people could conclude that
uncertain safety benefits in the event of a wildfire sometime in the future are outweighed
by the opportunity to continue in the present to enjoy what they perceive as important
aesthetic and naturalness values in their chosen environmental setting.

Humans, Fires, and Forests
14
Aggressive information and community awareness campaigns have assured that
most potentially affected publics recognize that wildfire is a threat. Most wildland-urban
interface residents know that wildfire is dangerous, and most are fully aware that remov-
ing flammable vegetation around their homes and properties would reduce their risk. But
action, whether clearing vegetation on individual properties or more generally supporting
community and national risk management programs, requires more than knowledge. Evi-
dence of the dissociation between knowledge and action is readily found—diet and exer-
cise being prime examples. Action requires motivation, a deeper, more basic psychological
processes that can be independent of knowledge.
Motivating action—Making one’s life and property safe from wildfire would, on the
surface, seem more than adequate motivation for support of and compliance with wild-
fire risk management programs. But, in addition to the uncertainty issues noted above,
safety is a complex motive founded on one of the most basic and psychologically prob-
lematic emotions, fear. Certainly people fear raging wildfires, and no doubt the sight of
such a fire would reliably produce swift and energetic action. But the actions that people
are expected to take in support of fuel treatment programs must be executed well in
advance of and well separated from any actual fire. Residents of wildland-urban interface
areas do not normally view the vegetation surrounding their homes as “fuel.” The
wildland-urban interface landscape is demonstratively attractive to many people, largely
because of the aesthetic and naturalness values it affords. The vegetation is a key part of
the attraction, and it is much more likely to arouse pleasure than fear, making “clearing
away the fuel” a less urgent and less likely response.
Even if people could be conditioned to feel fear in advance of the fire, there is good
reason to suspect that fear may not be the best motive for achieving sustained public
support and compliance with fuel reduction risk management programs. Actions moti-
vated by fear are notoriously erratic and unstable, both in the psychological laboratory
and in the “real world.” Drawing attention to fearful events raises negative feelings that
are prone to spill over to other aspects of the setting, including well-intentioned fire
safety officers and their programs. For fuel treatments to be successful they must be regu-
larly maintained and repeated, often for a very long time without any actual fire occur-
ring. That is, fuel treatments must be motivated and sustained by the desire to avoid
future harm and damage. Behaviors dependent on such “negative reinforcement” are very
prone to break down (“extinguish”) over time as the threatened negative event fails to
occur. Thus, avoidance of a feared event is not likely to provide an effective psychological
basis for a sustained wildfire risk management program.
Supporting motives—Certainly it would be irresponsible for environmental managers
not to acknowledge the very real threat of wildfire in the wildland-urban interface. But
fuel reduction programs need not be based solely on fear of catastrophic fire. In many
fire-prone ecosystems reducing excessive accumulations of vegetative fuels can bring some
immediate and continuing benefits in addition to promises of increased safety in the
future. For example, reducing fire hazard by clearing brush, thinning thickets of small
trees and opening up canopies in ponderosa pine forests can in many instances also
improve aesthetic quality and help to restore healthy natural ecological conditions. These

ERI Papers in Restoration Policy

ancillary benefits of fuel reduction can be appreciated immediately and continuously, in-
dependent of whether large wildfires ever occur. These positive motives, where appropri-
ate, would provide a more stable and more reliable psychological basis for sustaining
public support and active compliance with fuel reduction programs.
Conclusions _____________________________________________________________________
Wildfire is a real threat in rapidly growing wildland-urban interface areas. Managing
wildfire risk is an important responsibility of wildland managers and private property
owners in threatened areas. Securing public support of and compliance with traditional
prevention and suppression risk management strategies has been relatively easy, in part
because their rationales are psychologically compelling and the actions required of the
public are, on the face of it sensible and relatively undemanding. In contrast, the fuel re-
duction mitigation strategy currently advocated by managers is less compelling and more
demanding. Instead of protecting the status quo, fuel treatments require immediate and
continuing changes to environmental conditions that most perceive as aesthetically at-
tractive and natural. Fire is neither avoided nor attacked, but must be accepted as a
natural, recurring and perhaps necessary event in wildland areas. Improved fire safety is
achieved by preemptively clearing vegetation that might fuel a catastrophe, so that homes
and valued environmental settings and resources are less likely to be damaged or de-
stroyed. But safety, as a motive for action is based on fear, a particularly unreliable and
erratic psychological basis for any sustained action. A more effective, more stable psycho-
logical foundation for fuel reduction risk management strategies can be achieved by
adding the positive motives of ecological restoration and protection and aesthetic values
which can often be made compatible with public safety goals.

Communities
Fire in Our Midst:
A Look at Social Science Research Issues at the Community Level

Introduction
This paper provides an ever-so-brief discussion of social science research issues related to
communities and wildfire. As such, it looks at scales of organization that are intermediate
between individuals (attitudes and acceptability of fire and fuels treatments, etc.) and na-
tional/federal (policy issues, administrative structures, funding, policy incentives, etc.).
We divide the discussion into three sections. The first examines the impacts of fire on
communities. The second examines the ways in which communities can mitigate,
mediate, and transform the impacts that fires have on people. The third offers assorted
research questions and issues that seem particularly relevant at the community scale.
Fire impacts on communities ___________________________________________________
The traditional social impact assessment model tends to look at the impact of events on
communities. Applied to the question of wildland fire, this approach would lead us to
view fire events as primary causal agents or “independent variables,” and the individuals
and communities that experience such events as that which is being acted upon. Thus
various attributes of individuals or dimensions of community become the “dependent
variables” in such analyses. To be sure, there is validity to this perspective. For example,
fires are dangerous to peoples’ physical well-being and they certainly have the potential to
do great damage to the physical infrastructure of communities and to the landscape that
provides the physical setting for individual and community life. Fires can destroy the
equity in someone’s home, threaten municipal water supplies, overwhelm local structural
fire-fighting capacity and wreak havoc with local governmental budgets. It is no doubt
appropriate that a considerable portion of our firefighting efforts should be geared to
minimizing these impacts.
Our key point is that such impacts are not simply a matter of one-way cause and
effect. Communities are complex social systems, and they are linked to the natural lands
that surround them in multiple, and sometimes competing, ways. A significant fire will
therefore have multiple impacts on a community, and those impacts could vary signifi-
cantly across geography, across groups, and over time.

Humans, Fires, and Forests

The complexity of these interactions can perhaps best be illustrated by an example.
Based on a preliminary look at data from six case studies of wildfire impacts in western
American communities conducted over the past year and other work we and others have
conducted (Rodriguez-Mendez 1995, Carroll et. al. 1999, Kumagai 2001), two seem-
ingly paradoxical observations tend to stand out: fire serves as a galvanizing event and as a
disintegrating event. Nearly every interviewee talked about people “pulling together” in
the wake of fire. This “pulling together” manifested itself in a variety of ways from
sharing food and living space, donations of money and other resources, and shared labor.
Yet we also uncovered a variety of types of conflict and tensions that fires seemed to have
triggered or exacerbated. These ranged from personal and cultural conflicts to inter- and
intra-community conflict as well as local/federal conflict. In some cases this was the con-
tinuation or exacerbation of pre-existing conflict; in others it was the generation of new
conflict. What is particularly interesting is that the “pulling together” and the various
types of conflict that were occurring resulted from a similar, or in some cases the same,
fire event. The lesson here is that the community creates the stage upon which the social
impacts are played out.
Following this logic, we would posit two axioms:
1) Communities serve as important mediating institutions between the
individual resident or family and the fire event;
2) Characteristics and histories of the communities themselves have a great
deal to do with how fire impacts play out at both the community and
individual level.
Community impacts of fire _____________________________________________________
A focus on communities as mediating institutions reverses the traditional cause-and-
effect assumption that began this paper. While a conventional social impact assessment
model would examine the fire’s impact on the community, a no less important question is
“What are the community’s impacts on the fire’s effects?” Certainly the most obvious
measure of this is the degree to which the community has organized and prepared for a
wildfire event. Those communities with effective governance structures may have better
fire departments, better evacuation plans, and more extensive programs of homeowner
education and risk mitigation (i.e., Firewise-style programs). From a social science per-
spective, area of fruitful research would improve our understanding of how communities
function (and perhaps dysfunction) in the face of significant challenges. Along this line,
there are several issues/observations we want to emphasize.
The impact and interpretation of a wildfire is socially constructed. A fire is what it
is, but what it means is created through a complex social process. This process of social
construction is hugely influenced by the social context and discourse. “Tragedy,” “disas-
ter,” “natural,” “unnatural,” “dodged a bullet on that one,” and “the Feds’ fault,” are all
sentiments that one might read in the local paper or hear in the local coffee shop after a

large fire. The interpretation that people make of an event is directly impacted by the
people with whom they interact (what social psychologists refer to as their “reference
group”). In many cases, the need to hold a view that is informed by, and compatible
with, one’s reference group is so strong that people will only develop the most tentative of
interpretations before they have the chance to align themselves with their reference
group.
While socially constructed meanings can be a direct response to the particular fea-
tures of an event, they also condition our response to the event in powerful ways. We
respond not merely to the event, but to our interpretation of it. Perhaps the most famous
example of this in the human disaster literature—not fire related at all—is the Buffalo
Creek Dam disaster (Erikson 1976), the aftermath of which puzzled many observers in
terms of the community’s seeming inability to recover and reorganize. The post-event
social analysis suggested that the widely-shared belief on the part of community residents
that the event was the product of willful human negligence on the part of a mining
company, rather than a random act of nature, was a main reason for slow and incomplete
recovery. The implication was that if community residents had interpreted the cause of
the disaster to something other than human negligence, the impact of the event could
likely have been different.
In the case of wildfire impacts, it is our observation that the meanings attached to
fire events and the consequences of those meanings are like the Buffalo Creek case: inexo-
rably tied up with issues of the nexus of responsibility. The root causes of large wildfires,
and the damage caused by them, are complex. They are rarely entirely human or entirely
nature caused (although the media seems to focus obsessively on the source of ignition).
People tend to look for simplified explanations for their origins (lightning, human starts,
too much logging, not enough logging, short term drought, long-term climate change,
failure to fire-safe individual properties, failure to respond quickly enough in initial
attack, etc.). Such explanations of origin are part and parcel of the meaning of the fire
event, and are linked to the way people respond emotionally and instrumentally to the
event. They are also linked to beliefs about who should take responsibility for mitigating
current damage and for preventing damage in the future.
The political construction of fire ________________________________________________
Related to the social construction of the meaning of a fire event is something we will call
the political construction of fire: the strategic “spinning” of a fire event to line up with
and/or further a larger political agenda. This distinction is very similar to that drawn by
Gamson and Modigliani (1989) in their study of the nuclear power issue in the United
States. They suggest that every major policy issue has a culture within which particular
positions are constructed and encapsulated in interpretive packages which are then pre-
sented to the public. They distinguish this sphere from that of individuals making cogni-
tive sense of an issue or event. They state: “Both levels of analysis involve the social
construction of meaning” (p. 2).

Humans, Fires, and Forests
20
We observe both of these levels operating around fires at the community level (and
certainly at other levels as well). While we acknowledge there is a fine line between strate-
gic and merely social group-based meaning construction, we see noteworthy differences.
In some cases a political construction put forward by an opinion leader can be seen by
followers or fellow travelers as the “truth” and thus a new shared meaning is “born.” On
the other hand, a strategically constructed “package” must have broad resonance with the
values, world view, and prior experiences for it to become adopted. This phenomenon
can be observed on both sides of wise use/environmental divide. At this moment in polit-
ical history, it often takes the form of attempting to have one’s definition of what consti-
tutes a “healthy forest” or “healthy ecosystem”—and the management (or non-
management) prescriptions which logically emerge from it—win the political day.
Understanding the role that communities play in social and political construction is
crucial in understanding the recursive dialectic between community and individual fire
experiences.
Technocratic vs. local knowledge/perspectives __________________________________
Another dynamic we have observed is the tension between federal fire-fighting ap-
proaches and those favored by local fire companies. This seems to us to be partly a matter
of power and authority: the feds have it and the locals resent it, especially when it seems
excessively militaristic and unresponsive to local influence. More interestingly however, it
appears partly to be a matter of the legitimacy of different kinds of knowledge and expe-
rience. While locals generally acknowledge the feds’ “big picture” expertise (i.e., fire
models, weather forecasting through satellite imagery, etc.), they sometimes chaff at the
feds’ frequent dismissal of local experiential knowledge, particularly as it relates to details
of local geography and how fires have behaved in specific local drainages before. We have
also observed differences in 1) perceptions of risks, 2) willingness to take risks in order to
save particular houses or developments and 3) priorities for personnel and equipment de-
ployment. Taken together, these differences lay the groundwork for great differences of
opinion between local and non-local firefighters. In some cases these differences extend
even to the perspectives of elite (Type 1) federal fire-fighting teams versus locally-based
federal personnel. One interviewee told an interviewer of a conversation between a Type
1 team member and a ranger district fire fighter in which the former told the latter he
was taking the fire too personally and the latter replied that the former was not taking it
personally enough.
Such differences can have a profound effect on the overall frame that community
residents adopt regarding the fire. Utilizing theory from social psychology known as
causal attribution, Yoshi Kumagai (2001) has documented cases in which the frame of
blaming the federal firefighters for damage to a home or property was not justified by
“the facts” but rather seems to have been motivated by a psychological tendency to seek
human agents to hold responsible. Other cases of blaming that we have observed
however, are not so clear and seem to have more to do with strategic decisions made by

ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
21
federal fire managers, how such decisions were communicated and the disconnects
between such decision makers and local actors.
A Community Capacity Perspective _____________________________________________
There is a feedback loop between the capacities in a community, the outcomes they expe-
rience, and the development of capacity. Perhaps as efficient an illustration of this is from
Pretty (Figure 1; Pretty 2000). He conceptualizes communities as consisting of five differ-
ent kinds of capital: human, natural, financial, physical, and social. Serving to organize,
transform, and mediate the collective capacity that these capitals provide is a series of
community institutions and processes: policies, partnerships, institutions, etc. As a result
of these transformative processes, specific events occur: incomes rise, quality of life is
Figure 1 
The transformation of five capital assets (human, natural, financial,
physical, and social) to desirable outcomes (after Pretty 2000).

Humans, Fires, and Forests
22
enhanced, schools teach effectively, etc. But as a result of these events, the community’s
capital stock can in turn be increased; therein lays the feedback. A community’s capacity
affects and is affected by intentional outcomes and exogenously-generated events.
Because of the self-reinforcing and perpetuating nature of feedback loops, this
framework allows us to recognize that communities could be on a number of different
trajectories: increasing capital, stable, declining capital, etc. Each of these trajectories is
the context within which the fire impacts must be understood. In terms of Pretty’s con-
ceptualization, we can think of a wildfire event as an exogenous shock to the community
system. It certainly has the potential to change the local capital accumulation, by either
destroying physical capital (buildings, fences, etc.) but can also alter the natural environ-
ment in ways that many residents might dislike. But Pretty’s model also forces us to ac-
knowledge the extent to which the impact of the fire, both in the short and long term,
would be mediated by a series of community attributes.
Community/wildfire research issues ____________________________________________
It is self-evident that more money should be devoted to community-scale fire research
and that presumably we should get some portion of it. Virtually no research on commu-
nity-scale issues related to wildfire has been funded by land management agencies, so
claiming that more should be spent is superficial and trivial. Where any such money
should be allocated is the far more interesting question and one to which we turn our at-
tention.
First, we have posited two axioms:
1) Communities serve as important mediating institutions between the
individual resident or family and the fire event;
2) Characteristics and histories of the communities themselves have a great
deal to do with how fire impacts play out at both the community and
individual level.
The following research issues should be considered in light of these statements,
which admittedly are far more assertions than findings.
First, if the Pretty framework of community capital, mediating institutions, and
outcomes is applicable to wildfire, research based upon it would demand a longitudinal
orientation. Longitudinal studies of community capacity and outcomes are lacking, and
therefore we have virtually no context in which to understand the impacts of a fire. A sig-
nificant fire is not a tabula rasa event; rather, it is yet the latest event in long historical
tableau that shapes the community’s physical environment, self-identity, and shared
culture. To fully understand the interaction between the fire and the community
demands research that adequately places the fire in the historical context, and the various
social institutions that evolved in that community.

ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
23
Second, “firesafing” programs demand meaningful evaluation, and also offer a
context for exploring the importance of community capacity in effective self-organization
and compliance. Education programs intended to inform residential interface property
owners about wildfire risks and their mitigation options are major wildfire-related activi-
ties that occur at the community level. Because these programs have been a focal point
for considerable investment and effort, social science has a role to play in terms of maxi-
mizing their effectiveness. In particular, making an effort to minimize the risk of fire to
one’s own property falls into a category of problems known as social dilemmas: while it
makes sense for everyone to engage in the behavior, there is often insufficient incentive
for any particular individual to ambitiously do so (recycling and other forms of voluntary
self-restraint are also social dilemmas). There is a voluminous literature on social dilem-
mas, both in very theoretical/experimental settings and in field settings as well. This re-
search broadly concludes that non-compliance is largely inevitable, and that highly
socialized sanctions are probably more effective than strictly regulatory mechanisms in
promoting appropriate (i.e., firesafing) behavior. We are also concerned that firesafing in-
dividual homes is coming to be seen by many as a panacea for the wildland interface fire
problem. While it would seem foolish to us to minimize the importance of these activi-
ties by individual landowners, there are other scales—notably the neighborhood, com-
munity and forest stand level—that also need to be considered.
Even though the various firesafing programs should receive concerted evaluation,
they are certainly only part of the equation. How does the changing demographic struc-
ture of rural communities interact with their traditional reliance on volunteer fire depart-
ments? Rural communities are increasingly bedroom communities, and the working-age
people may be an hour or more away at their jobs, making them unable to serve as vol-
unteer firefighters. How does the relatively high degree of residential mobility in the West
affect patterns of informal community mobilization? Are new-comer/old-time tensions a
factor? Are some communities that experience fire able to organize economic partnerships
that can either capture economic value (salvage) or minimize losses?
If our arguments about the importance of the construction of meanings of fire
events in understanding their impacts are valid, we believe this suggests the use of qualita-
tive research methods to go along with the survey approaches that seem to dominate the
field at present. Closed-ended surveys only work in this topic area to the extent that the
meanings in question are already known and one is merely trying to document the distri-
bution of particular meanings in a population. We suggest that adequate prior knowledge
of socially constructed meanings is rarely, if ever, the case. Further, and more importantly,
we believe that the processes by which the meaning of wild fire events are created and
transmitted is of critical importance and these clearly are best studied through the use of
qualitative approaches.
It also is imperative that real time/quick insertion research teams be utilized. We
have some modest experience with research projects that deployed researchers into com-
munities in the midst of, or immediately after, significant fires. Just as physical/natural
scientists have recognized the need for quick insertion research strategies to capture
ephemeral data, social scientists need to think carefully about the time-dependent

Humans, Fires, and Forests
24
phenomena that they are interested in and develop methodologies that allow for real-time
data collection. There are a suite of research issues that accompany such designs (how do
you have human subjects approval in place prior to the event; what are ethical and re-
spectful research mechanisms among a population undergoing the stresses of a significant
wildfire, etc.), but these can be appropriately addressed with adequate planning and
design. Quick insertion teams would be particularly useful for understanding the various
disconnects that arise between fire managers and local actors in the midst of a fire event.
Certainly one phenomenon that warrants examination is the effectiveness of collab-
orative approaches for dealing with fire issues. Since the collaborative approach seems to
be the paradigm de jour in natural resource management, perhaps this research issue
needs no discussion here because it will receive sufficient attention without our prompt-
ing. But there is much about the issues inherent in the wildfire context that makes collab-
oration a somewhat different proposition. Collaboration in the pre-fire phase is easy to
envision and could easily follow the conventional models. There is a clear and galvanizing
shared enemy; there are tangible things that can be accomplished; there are resources
available, etc. Collaboration during a fire is a much more problematic endeavor. Much of
the literature on discourse-based decision making approaches conclude that they may
require more patience and take longer than other decision making strategies. It would
seem that the stress-filled rapidly changing decision environment of a large, unpredict-
able, and potentially destructive fire does not lend itself well to the emergence of collabo-
rative approach (although a well-functioning collaboration could be tremendously helpful
in co-ordination and communication). The post-fire phase also creates a problematic en-
vironment for the emergence of collaboration. The damage (real or perceived) that a fire
causes would likely create a relational chasm between the people who have suffered losses
and the agents they feel were responsible to protect them from that damage, typically the
land management agencies. Developing collaboration among these parties will require in-
ordinate patience and forbearance.

Theme Paper 3:
Fire Across the Gradient
Social Science Applied to Studying Wildland Fire Across a Gradient
Barbara Morehouse
University of Arizona
At first glance, the structure of wildland fire management in the United States gives the
impression that fire and its impacts occur across relatively homogeneous biophysical and
social surfaces. Even when some topography and vegetation variability is portrayed,
details are sparse to non-existent. Yet it is at fine scales that fire impacts occur.
Accounts such as historian Stephen Pyne’s The Fires of 1910 (2001) and journalist
John Maclean’s Fire on the Mountain (1999) give us examples of local and larger scales
that may be merged to reveal important human interactions with nature, and with
wildland fire. A perusal of the list of references included in Burning Questions: A Social
Science Research Plan for Federal Wildland Fire Management (Machlis et al. 2002) provides
additional avenues for research. A review of the references provided in Burning Questions
suggests a scarcity of peer-reviewed journal articles or papers reflecting the wide array of
potential approaches. On the one hand, this scarcity presents a challenge in terms of
having a solid body of thought and research activity on which to build. On the other
hand, it presents considerable opportunity to engage in innovative research.
A year ago, a planning meeting was held in Fairbanks Alaska to explore the idea of
doing fire-climate-ecology research across a (north-south) longitudinal gradient. Hanna
Cortner, Stephen Pyne and I participated in this meeting, but came away a bit perplexed
about how wide the representation of non-biophysical science was likely to be in the ini-
tiative. Further conversations with one of the meeting organizers, and between Hanna
and myself, led me to believe that there was a distinct opportunity to carry out quite in-
novative research based on the gradient idea, research that, rather than competing with
the research by the Alaska contingent, would actually complement it very nicely. What I
am offering for discussion here is an outline for how integrated social science might ac-
complish some really innovative comparative research. This research would be based on a
multifaceted set of theories and methods that examines similarities and differences in
wildland fire-human relationships across a longitudinal and elevational gradient stretch-
ing from Alaska to Mexico, and across an agreed-upon time scale of human occupancy of
the gradient area. Of course, we would not cover the entire north-south geographical
area; instead we would carefully select representative study sites such as, for example,
Alaska, western Canada, the Intermountain West, the Southwest, and a fire-adapted
landscape in Mexico.
What kinds of questions arise when we think in terms of this kind of study? Two
publications provide insight into how others have addressed this question. The first is
Burning Questions, which identified a list of social science research themes. I have para-
phrased their list in Table 1 on the next page.

Another source of insights into potential research questions and approaches is
Wildland Fire Research: Future Search Conference Notes, based on a workshop held in
Park City, Utah, in 1997 (USDA 1998). While this conference did not focus entirely
on human dimensions of wildland fire, key issues and research needs were identified in
this area. Insufficient social science insight was identified as existing in the following
areas:
• Incomplete description of socioeconomic factors contributing to fire
• Scarcity of studies on how managers make decisions, and about their use of
decision support systems for planning, budgeting, and fire suppression
• Scarcity of research on fire managers’ perceptions, including beliefs and
interorganizational roles/responsibilities
• Incomplete understanding of how public opinions regarding wildfire
acceptability evolve, and how effective risk communication programs
might be designed
• The lack, in existing economic studies, of comprehensive information
about short-term and long-term costs and benefits of management
alternatives
• Lack of assessments of the vulnerability and resilience of communities that
are affected by fire
Concerns were raised about the reactive nature of wildland fire decision making,
and the lack of a support structure that would facilitate innovation and risk-taking
among managers. Also noted was the need to generate sustained demand for and
proactive communication with the public and the media. A theme that recurs throughout
the document is concern that fire management increasingly requires a more integrated
approach, and is becoming increasingly complex. Managers are flooded with more data
and information than they can use to address regulatory requirements and other fire
management challenges, including increasing stakeholder participation and increasing
risk at the wildland-urban interface. At the same time, conference participants raised the
issue of a lack of trust among the public in government. Adaptive management strategies,
better funding arrangements for social science work, and improvements in knowledge
and effective technology transfer (including maintaining technologies through regular
updates) were cited as promising avenues. Improving accountability, and integrating re-
search, planning, and land management were likewise mentioned, as was developing and
maintaining monitoring systems that gather human dimensions data as well as biophysi-
cal data. Researchable areas and themes identified at the conference appear in Table 2
(page 30).
A third approach derives from my own research experience. I am currently involved
in two large federally-funded projects that integrate biophysical and social science re-
search in an effort to assess the impacts of environmental variability and change on
society, and of societal impacts on natural processes. One of these projects, Wildfire

Alternatives (WALTER), focuses directly on society-climate-fire interactions in the U.S.
Southwest (see Morehouse et al. 2000); the other, the Climate Assessment for the South-
west (CLIMAS) project, has wildland fire, in the context of climate and society, as one of
its focal areas (see, e.g., Morehouse and Garfin 2001).
In my role as social science researcher on this project, I am particularly curious
about how environmental variability and change influence human perceptions and efforts
to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience to fire risk, and how humans influence en-
vironmental change. This then leads me to wonder about what I might find out if I
delved into the environmental histories of specific areas, carried out structured analyses of
the social/cultural landscapes in each place, and explored how these factors might vary
across the gradient. Further, I’d like to know how perceptions and values might have
changed over time regarding human interactions with their landscapes, as well as their
perception of their own (and their community’s) type and level of risk.
As if peeling away the leaves of a cabbage (they’re less weepy than onions), more
questions for comparative analysis emerge: how have different economic and livelihood
patterns over time affected fire risk, and, conversely, how has fire history affected eco-
nomic prospects? How have migration patterns changed the nature of place-based narra-
tives, landscapes, risks, and decision options? What kinds of knowledge are brought to
bear in defining and addressing problems? What sorts of networks provide conduits for

31
developing and reinforcing specific kinds of narratives about fire? How have changes in
political and administrative structures changed the way fire is perceived and how it is
pragmatically dealt with? Is there any evidence of learning from the past, from one’s own
or others’ mistakes—or do we keep retelling the same story? What knowledge, insights,
and experiences do we share across the gradient? What are our significant differences, and
why these particular differences? I look forward to interacting with the participants in
this meeting to evaluate and refine this list, and to identify those components that might
be combined to produce a truly interesting and useful gradient-based analysis.
Answering the kinds of complex questions summarized in this paper requires a com-
mitment to interdisciplinary research arrangements; in my mind, it also calls for inquiry
into societal constructions of wildland fire. Interdisciplinary research takes time, consid-
erable effort, and good will among the participants. I can personally attest to the difficul-
ties inherent in learning how to collaborate, to talk each other’s language, understand
each other’s disciplinary enthusiasms and constraints, and formulate strategies that lever-
age strengths and supplement areas of weakness. Integrating stakeholders into the entire
research process, which I consider critical to success, adds mores layers of challenge. I
know, though, that such efforts can pay off very well, given the right research questions,
allocation of responsibility, and venue for sustaining dialogue—and given sufficient time
and resources.
What value might come of a gradient study such as the one I sketched out? First and
foremost, I believe very sincerely that we would have a golden opportunity to demon-
strate the wide array of approaches and insights we can bring to issues normally seen as
“physical science” problems. It is not uncommon, as I’m sure a lot of you know, for bio-
physical scientists to bring in a few “social scientists” to fulfill grant agency requirements
that their work be societally “relevant”—whatever that means. Thus, an economist, a
policy analyst, and/or a decision theorist may be persuaded to become a co-investigator
on a grant proposal. These individuals may provide quite useful knowledge to the
project, but the full range of potential insights that social science might offer remains un-
explored. The experience of global climate change research community provides one of
the best examples of lessons learned the hard way: early efforts, focused on biophysical re-
search were roundly criticized for lacking societal relevance (see, e.g., Rayner and Malone
1998). Debates since the late 1980s about how much social science, and what kinds,
should be integrated into climate impacts research have begun producing innovative
thinking with regard to identifying or devising appropriate disciplinary and interdisci-
plinary approaches to defining and addressing real-world problems (see, e.g., Miller and
Edwards 2001, Edwards and Schneider 2001). For example, an emergent theoretical per-
spective grounded in science studies seeks to understand how science and policy are or
could be co-produced through collaborations between scientists and stakeholders (see
Gibbons 2000, Hellstrom 2000, Weingart 1999, Jasanoff and Wynne 1998). The ulti-
mate goal of approaches such this as is to bridge the abyss between science and society
and produce results that more closely reflect the needs and concerns of real people living
in real places. Practitioners representing disciplines ranging from philosophy and history
to anthropology, human geography, sociology, political science, and so on, have a role to

play in bridging the fire-society gap. Likewise, fire science would benefit from broader ex-
periments in collaboration among a broader array of disciplines. Such collaborations are
likely to produce some of the most innovative ideas with regard to research questions
asked, array of different research collaborators involved, methods used, and means of
structuring and delivering results.
Second, we would be building bridges between communities and individuals inside and
outside the fire science universe. The capacity of fire science to interact effectively with com-
munity members and society more generally is limited at best. There are individuals who are
adept in “public relations” but the structure as a whole gives the impression of being very
inward-looking. Likewise, societal capacity to understand the fire science world is limited.
Critics of fire policy and management often portray decisions and practices as illogical,
ill-founded, and downright wrong-headed. Of course, fire experts have been known to say the
same things about society as well! In any case, by conducting and sustaining research across
the fire science-society divide, we can perhaps facilitate the development of an effective, sus-
tained dialogue.
Third, a gradient study approach would allow us to open inquiry to significant areas and
questions not often included in fire-society discourse. For example, we know that Mexico does
not pursue the same kinds of fire suppression policies that we do. Canada has different ways of
dealing with fire as well. Alaska, while a U.S. state, remains on the periphery of the discourse
yet has some very unique biophysical and societal characteristics that influence fire regimes,
fire risk, and fire management. Through engaging in comparative studies of these areas, we
will certainly answer some important questions about similarities and differences in
fire-society interactions. Equally important, we are likely to uncover compelling new questions
meriting concentrated research efforts. For example, the globalization of communications ca-
pabilities allows access to forecasts and information about fire conditions and events around
the world. What are the implications of this kind of access in terms of people’s perception of
the role of wildland fire, fire risk, and fire impacts? How might the insights from our gradient
study inform this question? What lessons, techniques, strategies, etc., from other areas of the
world might be useful in solving problems here?
Fourth, this kind of research may provide a means of holding scientists’ and decision
makers’ feet to the fire (so to speak), with regard to assuring that their research activities are
indeed relevant to society. I have argued elsewhere that relevance is ultimately defined by
society, not by science. This means that effective conduits must be developed to assure that in-
formation flows both directions throughout the research/policy formulation process. The
flows must be from society to scientists, as well as from science to society. This process is
neither easy to initiate nor to sustain, but the potential rewards in terms of developing pro-
grams that are acceptable to a broad enough array of interests to assure adoption and mainte-
nance over some longer period of time.
Fifth, interdisciplinary gradient research may provide valuable opportunities for building a
community of social scientists interested in wildland fire questions, as well as for advancing tech-
niques and theories, and producing new insights/knowledge within our various constituent disci-
plines. Such cross-fertilization may produce new hybrids specifically useful for carrying out
societally responsive research—perhaps even for more traditionally “ivory tower” research.

I mentioned funding earlier in this paper. My sixth reason for believing that the gra-
dient idea has value is that it offers a golden opportunity to compete for funds from
granting entities such as the National Science Foundation. It is no secret that funding for
the individual researcher, working by him/herself or with a graduate student or two, is
becoming increasingly scarce. At the same time, researchers at colleges and universities are
under increasing pressure to attract grant funding to fill the void left by cuts in other
sources of funding. Gradient analyses would provide an abundance of information useful
not only for fire management but also for dealing with all sorts of issues at the
human-wildland interface. To give but one example, there are activities afoot to establish
a National Environmental Observatory Network (NEON) to gather data about and
monitor environmental conditions and change. Some of us have been advocating for a
strong social science component, to assure that the design of the network and the opera-
tion of its various components, will produce information relevant to societal concerns.
There is a clear role for social-science fire research to play in this endeavor.
I am enthusiastic about engaging in dialogue with all of you about the possibilities
of the gradient approach, and to envision different permutations of my bare-bones
concept. Ultimately, I would like to establish an ongoing communication with a few of
you to see if we can flesh out the bones into a viable research proposal—and carry out the
research.

Introduction
At a world scale the use of fire by human groups has been a major force in shaping eco-
systems at the landscape level. Research records show that “…the evidence on the impact
of human and natural fires on the natural environment is substantial and complex, and
often contentious…” (Langton 1999: 3). From Australia to North America aboriginal
people use fire as a tool to control and manage their environment for multiple reasons in-
cluding religious or spiritual ones. In what is now the United States, anecdotal evidence
strongly points toward widespread “…occurrence of fire in the pre-European land-
scape…” (Stanturf 2002:2). Our natural environment is a result of all the forces of the
past, including particularly the use of fire by our ancestors. Many of the ancient fire-use
practices have been passed down for generations to the present. However, large increases
in population, shrinkage of available open spaces, and modern environmental rules and
regulations clash with traditional uses of fire by native or aboriginal people (Langton
1999, Stanturf 2002). Harmonizing the use of fire for landscape-level environmental ma-
nipulation with today’s environmental rules and regulations and societal fears of wildfires
is a major challenge.
This paper focuses on attitudes, perceptions, experiences, and practices of the varied
cultural and ethnic groups that interact with land managers regarding fire and fuels man-
agement in the Southwest. It briefly reviews the current state of knowledge and recom-
mends areas for future research. Important topics include how (and if) attitudes and
perceptions relating to contemporary fire use and management vary along cultural and
ethnic lines. Other discussions examine fire management practices of indigenous and tra-
ditional peoples and explore ways managers might make use of this body of information.
Why is it important to understand differing cultural perceptions and experiences
with fire? There are many reasons, not only in the Southwest, but throughout the
country as well. There is considerable land belonging to indigenous and traditional
groups that border federally-controlled lands. Management practices on the federal lands
can affect those in non-federal ownership and vice versa. Large, landscape-scale manage-
ment projects encompassing lands under a variety of ownerships are increasingly desirable
as means of treating significant areas, such as watersheds. Gathering support for these
multi-ownership projects often requires considerable cultural sensitivity and knowledge

Humans, Fires, and Forests

of the views and attitudes of the distinct groups who own or manage the land. In addi-
tion, many indigenous and traditional peoples maintain special uses and sacred places on
forests and grasslands now managed by public agencies. Demonstrating respect and con-
sideration, as well as following legal requirements and agency policies, mandates that
groups be consulted and their views concerning fire use and management on and near
these sites be valued and considered. Fairly representing the ethnic and cultural constitu-
encies of land-managing agencies, as well as developing representative samples, requires
inclusion of the full range of user groups. As discussed by González-Cabán et al. (unpub-
lished paper b) some areas of the country have very large Spanish-speaking populations;
omitting these Spanish speakers could potentially lead to unrepresentative samples. The
same may be true for other minority groups elsewhere in the country.
Current research on fire use, management practices, and attitudes of indigenous
and traditional peoples _________________________________________________________
Historical Research
There is a developing body of historical research concerning the fire use and management
practices of indigenous and traditional groups at both the national and regional south-
western levels. The works of Langton (1999), Blaney (1999), and Andersen (1999) in
Australia demonstrate that this is not an isolated event. Works by Stewart (1955a, b),
Lewis (1973, 1985), Dobyns (1981), Pyne (1982, 1995), Kay (1994), and Williams
(1999, unpublished paper) review Native American use of fire and its effects on pre-Eu-
ropean-settlement ecosystems. In a 1973 study, Lewis (1973) provides 70 reasons for
Native American vegetation burning. Kay (1994), Russell (1983a, b), and Williams (un-
published paper) also have compiled lists of the reasons indigenous groups were using
fire. From his extensive literature review of over 300 studies, Williams (unpublished
paper) summarizes 11 primary categories of fire use (Table 1). He also points out that
many of the same reasons listed for indigenous burning are the same as those for modern
times (Williams 1999: 31). It is important to notice that the use of fire was basically utili-
tarian in nature—that is, to satisfy the basic needs of the native population. Many of the
same reasons are found in the aboriginal populations of Australia (Langton 1999). The
majority of the North American information comes from research studies in the Pacific
Northwest, California, the Northeast, the Midwest, and forested areas of Canada (review
of annotated bibliography, William’s unpublished paper, discussed in Condie and Raish,
in press).
However, research was still needed on specific southwestern practices—consequently
a literature review was conducted by Condie in 2001 (unpublished paper) to examine
historic, ethnographic, and archeological sources on the use of managed fire in the
region. Fires used for land and vegetation management, or those that might have had
landscape-scale effects were considered. Groups included the Native Americans,
Hispanos, and early Anglo-American settlers of the area. Research was conducted on the
following Native American groups: Eastern and Western Pueblos, Apache, Navajo,

ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
41
Comanche, Ute, Kiowa, Cheyenne/Arapaho, Southern Paiute, and Manso-Suma-Jano-
Jocome. The work identified nine main reasons for burning (Condie and Raish in press;
Table 2). Clearing land for agricultural purposes, replenishing soil nutrients in agricul-
tural fields, killing woody species in rangelands and pastures, encouraging grass growth,
and increasing wild seed production were all important vegetation management tech-
niques of pre-industrial groups, which have the potential for relatively broad scale land-
scape effect.
“Although our knowledge of formalized burning practices among Pueblo
agriculturalists has been preserved erratically, an attitude toward fire as a fertile force still
persists in ritual contexts” (Bohrer 1983: 122). Information gained from the review dem-
onstrates that people were very cognizant of the use of fire as a management tool and un-
derstood its ecological effects, intentionally using it for specific purposes. The sources
show that the history of fire use in the Southwest is long, reaching well back into pre-Eu-
ropean-contact times. In certain times and places aboriginal and historic fire use had the
potential to create landscape-scale environmental effects, but the role and effects of
human-caused burning should not be automatically assumed (Condie and Raish in press;
Swetnam and Baisan 1996). For example, third-generation shepherd Leandro Salazar
recalls his father telling of fires set by shepherds to enlarge pastures in the northeastern
Jemez Mountains in the late 1800s, creating meadows that are still present today (Allen
1984: 131-132). After further research, Allen (in press) notes that fire scar data from the
area do not support fall burning, which would presumably have been the time when
shepherds fired pastures as they left for the winter. Thus, the fire scar information is ap-
parently inconsistent with Salazar’s claim or the shepherds were burning during some
other season (discussed in Condie and Raish in press). Further research is needed on
questions such as these, with other lines of evidence brought to bear on inconsistencies
between historical information and fire scar data. Archeoenvironmental studies may
prove helpful in this regard. Periman (2001), for instance, has examined the growing role
and importance of landscape archeoenvironmental studies in clarifying and understand-
ing pre-European-contact burning regimes.
Contemporary Research
There is also a growing body of national-level research and interest in the views on and
use of managed fire by contemporary indigenous and traditional groups. The social
science fire research review and plan discussed in the National Wildfire Coordinating
Group publication (2002), Burning Questions, does not focus a great deal of specific at-
tention on working with indigenous communities. However, the report does recommend
understanding relationships with key publics in terms of how they perceive federal
wildland fire management through ethnographic research. Tribes and individual Native
American communities are suggested as groups requiring study.
Research shows that some groups wish to continue the tradition of light burning
practiced in prior years (discussed in de Buys et al. 1999). For instance, the conference
“Traditional Use of Fire and the National Fire Plan” held by the Confederated Tribes of
Grande Ronde and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians in Oregon in 2002

Humans, Fires, and Forests
42
emphasized reintroducing the beneficial effects of traditional burning and accessing Na-
tional Fire Plan monies to accomplish the task. In a recent study, also from the Northwest,
Native American informants and researchers from botany and forestry discuss local fire
uses, describing how traditional ecological knowledge of fire is used to create desired ecosys-
tem effects (Boyd 1999). Other information outlines the role of prescribed burning in
maintaining and improving vegetation for groups as far distant as the Karuk of California
and the Hopi of Arizona. Both of these groups, as well as many others, now work with the
USDA Forest Service to assist in fire management projects on both tribal and federal land
(Thakali and Lesko, unpublished paper). This is also true in the case of Australia, particu-
larly in the Northern territory where the Aboriginal people are working with government
authorities in trying to maintain, and in some cases reintroduce, traditional burning prac-
tices into the management of large expanses of land (Langton 1999). As in the United
States, however, there are fears from the general population that this would increase the risk
of large wildfires.
Other work is currently underway examining contemporary community knowledge,
beliefs, attitudes, and practices concerning fire and fuels management in southwestern
forest, woodland, and grassland ecosystems with National Fire Plan funding. This project is
in its initial stages and is being undertaken by Wade Martin, Ingrid Martin, and Holly
Bender of Integrated Resource Solutions in cooperation with Rocky Mountain Research
Station (Carol Raish and Brian Kent). At a broader scale a study funded by the Joint Fire
Science Group is looking at the common concerns related to fuel treatments at the
wildland-urban interface in different regions of the country (Winter et al. 2002). Although
the specific concerns of Native American and other minority groups are not directly ad-
dressed in this effort, it provides information on the reasons why people do or do not
support different fuel treatment practices. In order to understand how knowledge, beliefs,
attitudes, and practices vary with cultural conditioning, residence location, and past experi-
ence, as well as to include all the varied user groups, the southwestern study will gather in-
formation from Native American, Hispano, and Anglo-American communities (see also
González-Cabán et al. (unpublished papers a and b); Loomis et al. 2002, Loomis et al.
2001). Preliminary information for issue development has been collected in interviews with
several Puebloan groups in New Mexico (Jemez, Nambe, and Santa Clara), providing valu-
able insight into their views and practices concerning fire as a vegetation management tool.
This preliminary work shows a high level of knowledge concerning the positive effects
of fire on ecosystems among the Puebloan resource management professionals that were in-
terviewed. Major issues they discussed included a strong desire to manage their own pro-
grams (with appropriate assistance as required), a need for better communication with
federal agencies, and a desire for additional federal education programs concerning the ben-
efits of prescribed fire that could be used in tribal education programs. Cultural resource
sites and sacred areas remain a major concern with groups. They believe that thinning, as
well as severe burns, makes sites more visible and more accessible to the public. As prior re-
search has shown (Raish et al. 1999), prescribed or intentional burning over sensitive site
areas can also be a problem. Some groups consider archeological sites not only the home of
ancestors but also living entities themselves.

Additional important research on the role of culture and ethnicity in conditioning
attitudes towards fire and fire management is occurring in the area of economics. A
recent study by González-Cabán et al. (unpublished paper a), compares survey response
rates, protest responses, and willingness to pay for two types of fire prevention programs
(prescribed burning and mechanical fuels reduction) for general residents of Montana
and members of two Native American tribes in Montana (the Confederated Salish-
Kootenai Tribe and the Blackfeet Tribe). The Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) was
used with a two-stage phone interview and a mailed booklet. In very brief summary,
results indicated that support for prescribed burning was similar between general
Montana households and Native Americans. Native American households actually sup-
ported the mechanical fuels reduction program at a higher level than other residents,
while the overall results indicated there may be more across-the-board public support for
prescribed burning than mechanical fuels reductions.
Another similar CVM survey project examined a body of related questions concerning al-
ternative wildfire fuel reduction techniques among English and Spanish-speaking households in
Florida (González-Cabán et al. unpublished paper b). In general, the survey results showed that
“support for wildfire mitigation policies is not statistically significantly influenced by…ethnic-
ity/language of the respondent. Although respondents’ attitude and knowledge differ by lan-
guage, there is no indication this creates differences in support for wildfire mitigation policies”
(González-Cabán et al. unpublished paper b).
These studies were undertaken to include the opinions of minority groups and
non-English-speakers in developing a body of information concerning forest management in the
United States. General fairness, as well as representative sampling, indicates that the many cul-
tural groups of the nation be allowed to express their views. The studies also were designed to
assess the effectiveness of the CVM survey technique when used with varying cultural groups
and with non-English speakers. According to the authors, they are not aware of any other pub-
lished comparisons of CVM responses of Native Americans and U.S. general population house-
holds (González-Cabán et al. unpublished paper a). Including a survey in Spanish was desired
because almost all CVM surveys have been conducted in English, despite the fact that some
areas of the country have very large Spanish-speaking populations. Effectively omitting these
households could lead to unrepresentative samples (González-Cabán et al. unpublished paper b).
In general, the projects showed that the CVM survey format worked well for Native Amer-
icans in Montana both on and off the reservations. There was a difference in the follow up
survey rate (the second of the set of phone interviews), however, with the Native Americans
having a significantly lower response rate that reduced the ability to generalize from the sample
to the general Native American population. The authors suggest that future surveys explore at-
tempts to increase response rates, such as including a letter from tribal officials in the mailed
booklet (González-Cabán et al. unpublished paper a). In the Florida survey, response rates of
English and Spanish speakers to the entire survey process were similar (González-Cabán et al.
unpublished paper b).

Recommended future research on fire use, management practices, and attitudes
of indigenous and traditional peoples ___________________________________________
As mentioned, there is a growing body of information on these topics. However, specific
southwestern information is still required in several critical areas, with needed research in
both historical and contemporary studies. Research is lacking concerning historical un-
published archival sources, such as documents, manuscripts, records, photographs, and
maps relating to fire use and management practices of Native Americans, Hispanos, and
early Anglo-American settlers in the region. This work will complement prior studies that
have reviewed published sources (Condie unpublished paper). The status, extent, and
availability of unpublished information should be assessed, followed by review and syn-
thesis of whatever data are present. A project is beginning in early 2003 to accomplish
these tasks for archival sources in Arizona, New Mexico, and the far western portions of
Texas and Oklahoma (Rocky Mountain Research Station, Research Joint Venture Agree-
ment with consulting historian Thomas Merlan, Santa Fe, New Mexico).
Continued work with contemporary groups can provide fruitful avenues for gather-
ing important and missing information, as discussed below. Interviews with additional
Native American groups in the Southwest, who are currently using forests and grasslands
of the area, are needed. Interviews should gather information on contemporary or desired
burning and other vegetation management practices that groups would like to imple-
ment, as well as attitudinal information on prescribed fire as a vegetation restoration and
management tool. Data on problems, issues, and concerns related to burning or to
working with public agencies on burning and vegetation management projects also need
to be examined. Gathering information on traditional practices for land managers could
be accomplished at this time.
The importance of collecting data not only from a variety of groups but also from a
variety of people within a group must be considered. In addition to tribal resource man-
agers, religious leaders and general tribal members can provide valuable information and
possibly different perspectives; these people should be sought out when possible. Col-
lecting oral history information on traditional practices from the elders is particularly
critical. As the older generation ages, opportunities to work with this group become more
restricted. Data gathering techniques like participant observation from social sciences
such as anthropology can be particularly helpful in this regard (Raish et al. 1999). This
same type of information collection program can be undertaken with Hispano communi-
ties, community leaders, and members. Conversations with forest and grassland users
from these communities, such as grazing permittees and recreationists, as well as land
grant members, can provide valuable discussions concerning contemporary and tradi-
tional resource management techniques.
It should be noted that Native Americans, Hispanos, and Anglo-Americans are not
the only southwestern ethnic/cultural groups with a potential body of information on fire
use and management. There are growing African-American and Asian-American commu-
nities in the region, as well as religious/cultural groups, such as the Latter Day
Saints/Mormon communities, who also should be consulted.

In addition to interview data, which of necessity usually targets a relatively limited
group of respondents, more broad-scale survey information is needed from a variety of
cultural/ethnic groups across the region. Where appropriate, survey materials and surveys
themselves may be in the language of the respondents. Spanish-language work, as previ-
ously described for the Florida study, is certainly appropriate for the Southwest. The need
for using other languages besides Spanish would require further study and should be de-
termined on a case-by-case basis. Using native speakers as research partners in project
choice, design, and implementation is very important and has proved successful in
various areas (examples include subsistence resource work in Alaska and tribal archeology
and preservation programs in the Southwest, and in Australia) and might be beneficial in
this case.
A program designed to gather regional economic survey information using the
CVM or other nonmarket valuation technique format in combination with other demo-
graphic data could provide an important comparative base for data from other parts of
the country. Willingness to pay and preferences for the various types of fuel treatments
can be collected across ethnic/cultural groups and across regions. Benefit-cost analysis
studies can be used to determine the positive and negative economic impacts on different
groups of the fuel reduction programs, and address concerns of social justice. Differences
within groups residing in different areas could provide valuable insight into regional vari-
ations in cultural traditions, attitudes, and experiences with fire.
Longitudinal studies will help track changes in attitudes and behavior towards fuel
treatment practices both from the Native American or Aboriginal point of view and also
from contemporary communities. Finally, providing the resulting appropriate attitudinal
and behavioral information concerning cultural variations in fire and fuels management
views and practices to the land managers responsible for fuels reduction projects is criti-
cal. Training sessions, databases, and publications geared to the targeted audience should
be developed. Funding for this type of technology transfer is critical and often seems to
be overlooked. In addition, scientists conducting the research must be encouraged and re-
warded for developing technology transfer materials at the same level as they are rewarded
for academic-style publications. There is little practical utility in gathering a valuable
body of data if those charged with on-the-ground application are unaware of its exis-
tence. Both historical and contemporary research is needed on cultural/ethnic variations
and traditional practices concerning fire use and management. Gathering and disseminat-
ing these data are challenges for current and future southwestern fire research.

Fire suppression was a social choice in the United States over 90 years ago. This choice is
now manifested in long-standing policies, budget commitments, institutions, and icons
like Smokey Bear. But has more than fire been suppressed? One of the classic works in
public administration—as well as fire policy—is Ashley Schiff’s Fire and Water: Scientific
Heresy in the Forest Service (1962), which examines the relationship between science and
management in the USDA Forest Service and how the agency effectively suppressed
science that challenged the agency’s conventional wisdom. Following Schiff’s lead, we
question whether some kinds of social science research are being suppressed because exist-
ing institutional arrangements preclude certain questions from being asked in the first
place. To pursue this line of thought, we first consider four questions we think need
asking about the politics and institutional dimensions of forest fire management. We
then raise some concerns pertaining to the availability (or lack thereof) of institutional
support and capacity to explore these questions.
First, how have our current institutional arrangements for fire suppression and pre-
vention emerged, what assumptions are they built upon, and are they still capable of ad-
dressing tomorrow’s problems? At a fire workshop last year, the preeminent fire historian
Stephen Pyne (Pyne 1982, 2001) pointed out that no one has yet written a political
history of fire. Having assumed that what Pyne has done historically is pretty compre-
hensive, hearing this obviously was somewhat of a surprise. What he was talking about
was a particular focus on, and analysis of, the choices society has made that ultimately
shape the ways in which fire is defined politically as a problem, resources are politically
allocated toward recognized problems, institutions are arranged to act upon those prob-
lems, and, ultimately, certain interests become vested in ways of doing things. Pyne’s ob-
servations echo a claim made by political scientist Terry Moe (1989) that policy choices
are in fact choices for certain kinds of institutional arrangements, bureaucratic structures,
and standard operating procedures. For example, the “10:00 a.m.” rule as a policy choice
required a rapid response force for suppressing fires as quickly as possible. The corre-
sponding institutional arrangements and bureaucratic structure became an enduring mili-
taristic incident command system that stands apart from other land and resource
management functions, despite the fact that the 10 a.m. rule is no longer practiced. Even
if we want to change how we politically define and address “the fire problem,” we still
have to contend with institutions set up to address a 90 year-old political definition of
the fire problem. In sum, political history asks us to step back and reconsider whether we

Humans, Fires, and Forests
52
are taking for granted what the problem is in the first place. Knowing how and why poli-
cies and institutions evolve around a certain problem definition helps us identify leverage
points for change and develop strategies for overcoming deeply entrenched obstacles to
change. Who is up to the task (and risk) of developing this political history of fire?
With such background information we can focus on the questions Schneider and
Ingram (1997) suggest we ask about the design of all policies. One question in this regard
concerns the behavioral assumptions underpinning current policies and programs. Behav-
ioral assumptions influence how we view the targets of fire policies and programs, and
the particular policy tools we choose to influence the desired behavior. In the area of pre-
vention, for example, we frame appeals to homeowners on the behavioral assumption
that it is rational for them to take action to reduce risk to property, rather than on the be-
havioral assumption that not taking action may also be rational. Fire prevention educa-
tion also assumes that all homeowners—especially homeowners in the so-called
wildland-urban interface—care primarily about their structures rather than the various
aesthetic and environmental qualities of the surrounding landscape. Given the whole
range of social and policy disincentives for homeowners to take the actions desired of
them (insurance payoffs, disaster relief, aesthetic value of surrounding trees), the various
reasons homeowners give for not taking desired action (Smith and Rebori 2001), and the
multi-dimensional values held by homeowners living in or adjacent to wildland areas
(Burns 2002), we may need to rethink our policy strategies in the area of homeowner and
private property fire education. The community development approach facilitated by
University of Nevada-Reno cooperative extension agents, for example, offers one alterna-
tive approach informed by different behavioral assumptions. The rapidly changing demo-
graphics of homeowners and communities within or adjacent to wildlands further calls
into question the behavioral assumptions of existing policies and policy tools.
A second area of inquiry involves the interjurisdictional and cooperative arrange-
ments that surround fire policy. Several years ago Cortner was involved in a Forest Service
policy analysis of the agency’s emergency services and mutual aid activities (Cortner et al.
1990). Agency concerns prompting the study were two-fold. First, historically it had
been common practice for Forest Service units to respond to reported structural fires,
vehicle fires, and vehicle accidents within the agency’s jurisdiction and mutual aid re-
sponse zone, but the frequency of such responses increased during the 1980s as the
wildland-urban interface situation intensified. A second driver behind the study began
with the 1985 Ojai fire and the 1987 fires in California and Oregon. To the Forest
Service it seemed that wildland fire suppression resources were being committed to struc-
tural fire protection while wildfires burned unabated in valuable stands of timber—which
were in many cases valued many times greater than the involved structures. The agency
questioned to what extent the complex set of cooperative and mutual aid agreements it
had with state and local fire and emergency services were moving the agency beyond its
traditional wildland firefighting roles and into situations for which it was neither
equipped nor trained. The study found that the role of the federal firefighter had
changed in response to interface situations, and made a number of policy recommenda-
tions about training and equipping wildland fire forces and about changing some

ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
53
provisions in the agency’s cooperative arrangements and mutual aid agreements. It was
not able, however, to document tradeoffs between forest resources and built structures
because the data weren’t there. Yet, today this remains a germane question, and one where
the evidence might now exist. This evidence can be examined in light of the emerging
fire-related federalism instigated by the National Fire Plan (NFP).
The NFP bolsters existing, and creates new, resource and technology transfers from
the federal government to state and local authorities for achieving a wide range of objec-
tives and activities. In some instances, the NFP goes beyond traditional cooperative
agreements; it is designed to create new institutional arrangements for managing
wildland fire risk to communities and the environment. As noble as the intent of the
NFP might be, it, too, carries assumptions—the primary one being that the federal, state,
and local governments as well as communities all share the same goal. At a general level,
this assumption may hold true. But there are inherent tensions between objectives of the
NFP, which are to reduce wildland fire risk to communities, and the objectives of many
state governments and local communities, which are to continue to foster developments
in the wildland-urban interface. Are these policy objectives compatible? To what extent,
empirically, are these objectives mutually exclusive across the U.S.? With a public invest-
ment of $1.2 billion (nearly 40% of the Forest Service’s total annual appropriation!!), we
surmise that such questions need to be asked and answered.
A third line of inquiry concerns future policy development and change. Cecilia
Danks (2000) has suggested some potential new institutional configurations for fire man-
agement as adaptations to new ecological and community-based approaches to wildland
fire management emerge. For example, fire management would need to change from an
institutional structure of strategies, procedures, and tools organized mainly around epi-
sodic, immediate fire suppression activities to one where resources are allocated on an
ongoing basis and mostly for forest restoration and fuels management. What then would
be the ramifications of such changes and what politically would need to happen to make
them occur? Danks has also pointed to the need for institutional adaptations that would
include moving away from an institutional structure built around a centralized capacity
to respond to fire, to one based on a decentralized capacity to manage.
But certainly, as Matt Carroll is finding, there are some real barriers and political
tensions surrounding the involvement of local people and local resources in decision
making on the fire lines. During the fires of 2002 local folks met full force the large, cen-
tralized technocratically-based fire structure that constitutes the fire suppression culture.
The Economist magazine (August 17, 2002) also recently posited that there was a fire-in-
dustrial complex dependent upon large fires and fire suppression, including the private
contractors that benefit from supplying everything from toilets to tractors on the fire
lines. What do we really know about the political power surrounding these arrangements,
and what can this tell us about how these stakeholders may affect the feasibility of
making policy changes? Without stealing the thunder of Steve Daniels and Matt Carroll,
what is the capacity of communities to develop and sustain collaborative approaches to
reducing fire risk to a manageable level without breaking the bank? How durable are
community-level institutional arrangements?

Humans, Fires, and Forests
54
Fourth and finally, what will be the politics of policy change? If there is recognized
need for reform, what will be the policy impacts, both intended and unintended? We
seem on the verge of making considerable new policy in terms of NEPA environmental
impact analysis and appeals processes for fuels reduction projects, for example, without
much data or analysis to shed light on the various claims and counterclaims being offered
up in the current debate. But it’s also politically logical that it’s not data and analysis that
are wanted. Given the political rhetoric to define and redefine the nature of our fire
problem and, more significantly, who is causing the problem, what we may indeed seeing
politically is that forest health, restoration, and fire are strategically being offered up as
the new playing ground over which to carry out debates about environmental policy and
public lands management in general.
For example, last April a meeting was convened in Fort Collins entitled, “Fire, fuel
treatments, and ecological restoration: proper place, appropriate time” attended primarily
by fire scientists and forest managers. The day the conference ended, another conference
convened by a coalition of environmental organizations started in Boulder entitled, “Re-
storing public lands: reclaiming the concept of forest restoration.” We don’t know if the
timing was intentional or merely coincidental, but the juxtaposition of the two confer-
ences illustrates the highly politicized nature of the debate. It has also been a rather clever
political strategy by the Bush administration and certain western congressional represen-
tatives to paint environmentalists as the evil doers in the forest health debate—a strategy
which has implications for defining the winners and losers in other environmental
debates as well. That the environmental organizations have intentionally sought to
“reclaim” the problem definition makes it apparent just how high the stakes may be in
changing fire policy and its attendant consequences for fuels treatments.
The above questions might be added to other identified areas of policy-institutional
research, including those highlighted in Burning Questions (Machlis et al. 2002), e.g., or-
ganizational capacity and decision making effectiveness. The goal, however, should be to
move beyond enumerating questions to developing the organizational capacity and
support to start answering them. There is no point in building the research agenda
forever. So we now turn our attention to examining whether there is sufficient political
support and institutional capacity for actually making significant and sustainable progress
on these research agendas. As a first point of departure, we ask: where in the federal
natural resource agencies (Forest Service, BLM, NPS, USGS) are there research units ac-
tively centered on addressing the identified questions in a consistent, coherent, and
focused manner? Where are the political scientists and other kindred souls assigned to do
research on such questions? Where in the fire science program do these questions fit and
are funded?
There is still the predominant political mask of scientific determinism in the natural
resource agencies that results in fundamentally political questions being viewed simply as
technical problems, i.e., “if only we can get the (biophysical) science ‘right,’ then the
problems will be solved.” This, of course, is reinforced by political decisionmakers who
are threatened by research and analysis challenging their own privileges/stakes under
current institutional settings. It is far easier to conduct research to maximize acres treated

ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
55
than to acknowledge that in large part social and political factors have gotten us into the
situation we are now in and will determine how we democratically work through this sit-
uation.
To the extent that agencies are either loath or not supported by Congress to ask
many of these questions, where else can support be found? NSF doesn’t support large
amounts of applied research that the mission agencies are supposed to do. Foundations
also shy away from studies that don’t translate into on-the-ground projects serving their
particular policy agendas. That perhaps leaves the few policy scholars in the universities
privileged to their share of McIntire-Stennis or agriculture experiment station (Hatch)
dollars. That, however, leaves out scholars in other areas, who might have the expertise
but not the required departmental or college affiliation, from fully engaging in such re-
search. Forestry departments, for example, jealously guard their right to control these
dollars for the benefit of their departments.
Least you think that this is just a lament about the unappreciated state of social
science research, more generally, and a plea for more government funding, in particular,
let’s also look at two other issues: the responsibilities of researchers themselves and the
pitfalls of publicly-funded research. First, social science researchers in the policy sciences
also have some responsibilities. In applied research, the focus is first and foremost on ad-
dressing pressing pubic problems. Unfortunately, a long-standing debate, at least in the
public policy arena, has been the extent to which the scholar’s first priority should be the
problem or developing disciplinary theory. Research results that use fire simply as a con-
venient tool to develop, test, and refine theory will necessarily be of less interest to agen-
cies and congressional appropriators who must respond to constituents interested in
saving forests and homes. Of course, theory is important and helps frame and explain re-
search results. Young faculty especially are expected to contribute to the literature and
advance theory in their disciplinary fields. But the reality is that while research addressing
the advancement of disciplinary theory may often get you published in the American Po-
litical Science Review, it also reinforces the perception that such research is irrelevant to
solving real-world problems. If we aren’t to simply bemoan our fate, we need to acknowl-
edge the responsibilities that also go with policy relevant, and publicly-funded, research.
Moreover, all researchers, including social scientists, have to examine the culture of their
science and determine needed changes. Are social scientists, many of whom are embed-
ded in positivist research traditions, ready to accept and use new models of civic science
that engage citizens in the research process, to acknowledge the legitimate role of other
systems of knowing, e.g., experiential and indigenous knowledge, and to confront explic-
itly their roles/obligations to advance their research results in a timely manner in the
policy arena? Participatory research is already upon us, an example being the Ford Foun-
dation’s Community Forestry Research Fellowships that are granted on condition that the
fellowship recipient uses participatory research approaches. But where are the training,
mentoring, and publishing outlets that help this kind of research be meaningful? It isn’t
just a matter of funding; it’s also a matter of institutional arrangements embedded in the
culture and institutional arrangements of social science research itself. Whereas positivist
social science seeks to generalize based on statistical models and to test universal theories

Humans, Fires, and Forests
56
of behavior, participatory research seeks to improve specific situations, eschews models,
and is generally ambivalent to universal theories. Promotion and tenure tend to value the
former; real-world problem solving is increasingly calling for the latter.
Second, let’s stop to look at the political consequences of publicly-funded research.
While client-driven research conjures up noble notions of relevancy, we have not yet
totally passed the age of active suppression of research results in many areas, whether it is
medical or agricultural research. The entity that pays necessarily comes bearing political
strings that determine what questions are asked in the first place, and the boundaries sur-
rounding the questions that are asked. And as many scholars have found in the case of
proprietary research, the client even controls the results. Moreover, we are already seeing a
war on terrorism—a war without any discernable end—being used as justification to
affect who engages in research and what research results are publicly disseminated. The
rules for sponsored social science research are being rewritten and the researchers them-
selves are most likely sitting on the sidelines.
Finally, as university cultures move to prize externally-funded grants and contracts as
a way to bolster declining revenue streams—and not coincidentally as a measure of
faculty worthiness on an annual basis—we need to ask what price do these new institu-
tional arrangements carry for free inquiry in a democratic society? Many penetrating
studies of politics and policy have occurred without external funding. So the question is
how will the universities of the future regard their obligations to provide a climate (in-
cluding institutional support and resources) in which unfunded researchers can freely
examine questions that challenge the status quo or threaten the politically powerful? Are
we setting up an institutional structure in which science in service of the state and/or cor-
porate America is the rewarded standard and the independent non-funded scholar is in-
creasingly negatively regarded?
We are hopeful that our discussions at this workshop will provide us with a better
picture of what actually has been done to examine questions of fire policy, politics, and
institutional arrangements in the past, what is going on now that we are obviously
unaware of, and what realistic opportunities there are for more work in this area. It is also
not enough to simply lament the poorly-funded state of social science in general or policy
sciences in particular—as long as the whole array of institutional arrangements by which
we define, fund, and conduct fire-related research remain unquestioned. Many of the
questions that we can identify as highly germane to developing socially equitable and po-
litically feasible solutions to our fire and forest health problems, we posit, do not have the
research infrastructure to attract and sustain a coherent and cumulative research program.
The result is the suppression of questions that need to be asked concerning critical politi-
cal information about who wins, who loses, and who is even being asked to play the
game. There needs to be serious examination of the institutional arrangements for fire
research itself.

Goals seem like a good place to start. What are the goals of wildfire management? Three
different goals are commonly articulated: (1) preventing loss of life and damage to prop-
erty and resources; (2) preventing catastrophic/crown fires; and (3) restoring natural fire
regimes. Are these goals compatible? Not in all circumstances. In some ecosystems, for
example, the natural fire regime is periodic crown fire, often at long return intervals; in
this situation, goals 2 and 3 could not both be achieved. Even the relative simplicity of
goal 1 is not without ambiguity. This is the standard goal of federal wildfire management,
as established in the 1995 Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy and Program Review.
At that time, the policy was revised to balance property and resource protection, follow-
ing fire control efforts in Washington in 1994 where substantial timber volumes were ap-
parently sacrificed to protect a few houses. Preventing loss of life and property damage
strongly implies a focus on the wildland-urban interface (WUI), but protecting resources
implies a broader focus on wildlands with resources that can be damaged by wildfire (typ-
ically timber). This raises the question of whether protection efforts in the WUI should
take precedence for federal efforts and money over broader wildland protection. Defining
the goals and priorities, with possible variations for different ecosystems as well as with
involvement of the public, seems like a necessary first step for wildfire management.
Both the National Fire Plan and the Bush Healthy Forests Initiative have focused
on the need to reduce fuel loads to prevent losses (life, property, and resources) from un-
controlled fires (presumably goal 1). If one follows the money, however, it is clear that
Congress and the Administrations (both Clinton and Bush) have continued the strategies
of the past, with the majority of the money spent to control wildfires. It appears that
both Administrations have studiously avoided looking at the relative benefits and costs
(especially the costs) of fuel reduction. In 1999, GAO estimated that it would cost $12
billion to reduce fuels on the 39 million acres of national forest land then estimated to be
at high risk of catastrophic wildfire (which is more like goal 2)—$725 million annually
through 2015.
b Since then, the national forest acreage at high risk of “losing key ecosys-
tem components” in a wildfire has risen to 51 million acres (up 30%), with another 23

60
million acres of other federal land at high risk.
c Furthermore, many proponents of fuel re-
duction advocate treating lands at moderate risk—80 million acres of national forest land
and 75 million acres of other federal land. At $300 per acre for treatment (the cost given
to GAO by the Forest Service), it would cost $39 billion to treat the national forest lands,
and another $29 billion to treat the other federal lands. At the current (FY2002) appro-
priation level of $395 million annually ($209 million for the Forest Service and $186
million for Interior), it would take 172 years to treat all these lands. The first time.
There is little information to assess the costs of addressing other goals (1 and 3).
There appears to be no basic data on the extent, location, or value of structures in the
WUI and how the WUI is changing (presumably expanding). Some information might
be gleaned from secondary sources, such as Census data, but it is unclear whether such
data might be adequate for examining the situation. There is even less certainty for assess-
ing the costs of restoring and maintaining natural fire regimes in any one ecosystem, let
alone the myriad of ecosystems that exist in North America. Let me add that, while the
focus has been on the intermountain west, this is not just a western, federal land issue.
Southern pine, jack pine, some hardwoods, and other ecosystems of the south, the
midwest, and the northeast are also adapted to periodic surface fires, but restoring and
maintaining natural fire regimes in areas with a multitude of private landowners is an
even bigger problem than for the predominately federal timberlands in the intermountain
west.
The social impact research can be separated into the four significant components of
wildfire management: (1) firefighting preparedness (personnel and equipment); (2) fuel
reduction; (3) initial attack; and (4) large-fire suppression. Questions include how much,
of what type, when, and where, and what difference it makes in the ecological, environ-
mental, social, and economic setting.
Wildfire management has traditionally focused on simple, straightforward poli-
cies—the 10:00 a.m. policy, the 10-acre policy, the “let-burn” policy. Why? The
institutional structure of the wildfire management organization is probably the most
rigidly hierarchical organizational structure outside the military. During large-fire sup-
pression, which has dominated expenditures since the 1910s, this may well be neces-
sary—time and clear lines of authority are often of the essence for firefighter safety, and
questioning or debating decisions is infeasible and dangerous. The result is: simple (sim-
plistic?) policies, a simple message (“Only you ...”), a focus on control, and belief in the
desirability and feasibility of fire control.
Knowledge of the desirability of fire control has evolved over time. In the 1920s and
1930s, information about wildfire benefits was suppressed, for fear that it would encour-
age arson fires. Since the 1970s, broader public understanding of ecology and the natural
role of fire in many ecosystems has led to acceptance of prescribed burning, even when

the fire’s cause was natural (the prescribed natural fire policy). Even as recently as 1988
(the Yellowstone fires), there was still a vigorous public outcry over not aggressively sup-
pressing every fire. But by 2000, in the debate following Cerro Grande (the escaped pre-
scribed fire that burned 235 homes in Los Alamos, New Mexico), the issue was not
whether prescribed burning was wrong, but whether the timing and conditions had been
appropriate.
Feasibility of control is a different issue. The feasibility of controlling wildfires, espe-
cially crown fires, is both always questioned and never questioned. Observations about
our inability to contain raging infernos are commonplace, even among experienced
firefighters. However, the idea of sitting around and waiting for the weather to change (or
for the fire to run out of fuel) is anathema. Even though many of us suspect (and occa-
sionally say) that firefighting makes little or no difference,
d we still put forth our best
efforts to try to control catastrophic wildfires. Not only that, but we’re still willing to
“throw everything we’ve got at the fire” to try to make a difference. This approach is not
really surprising, since not trying (and presuming that our efforts were largely a waste of
time and money) would be the hypocrisy and cognitive dissonance on a grand scale.
The result is that most wildfire management professional experts are strongly biased
with the belief that successful efforts—in preparedness, fuel reduction, initial attack, and
large-fire suppression—are (or at least must be) both feasible and desirable. This biased
expertise is reflected in many of the fire models used to assess all aspects of wildfire man-
agement. The influence of this biased expertise is more pronounced than in many other
forestry specialties, because of the difficulties in conducting research into wildfire effects
and control. Prescribed fires are often not useful for research purposes, because the
weather and fuel conditions under which they burn typically do not reflect wildfire con-
ditions. (If they did, they’d become wildfires, not prescribed fires.) Wildfires are often not
useful for research, because the a priori weather and fuel conditions are generally not
known; the conditions can sometimes be extrapolated after the fire, but local variations in
fuels (loads, moisture, arrangement, etc.) and in winds make the validity of such extrapo-
lations questionable. Conditions in wind tunnels and fire chambers can rarely duplicate
the complexity of wildlands. And experimental wildfires are politically unacceptable.
(Dr. Jack Cohen went to Canada for his experiments on protecting structures from crown
fires.) Thus, the scientific basis for fire models is less developed than in many other areas,
and models are therefore more likely to be based on biased professional expertise, belief,
and expectations.
d Interestingly, in congressional briefings in May and June of 2002, the agencies noted
that they were likely to deplete their fire suppression appropriations sooner than ever
before. The reason given was the severity of the 2002 fire season, which at the outset
was worse than the severe 2000 fire season. No one seemed to question that it might be
because they had more firefighters, trucks, helicopters, and airplanes than ever before,
because of the substantial increase in appropriations for fire preparedness in FY2001
and FY2002.

Let’s turn to the politics of wildfire management. Politicians need to be seen trying
to do something about the problem. We have demonstrated that we can generally control
fires in homes in cities and towns, why can we not protect homes in forests? The answer
has to do with the relative cost and efficiency of concentrated vs. dispersed control orga-
nizations, as well as the ecology of wildfires in some wildland ecosystems. Ignoring per-
ceived widespread problems (as well as real ones) is the surest way for a politician (local,
state, or national) to get retired by the voters.
Nationally, forestry issues have traditionally focused on federal lands. This is largely
the result of the debate over federal regulation of private forestry practices from the 1920s
through the early 1950s that concluded with the federal role limited to encourage-
ment/inducement of desirable forestry practices, and state regulation. Hence, federal
control over forestry is limited largely to federal forestlands, and for wildfire manage-
ment, the focus has been on the need to reduce fuels on federal (especially national
forest) lands to protect private homes built in the forest (in the WUI). This leads to two
concerns: (1) the effectiveness of fuel reduction to protect homes; and (2) the federal re-
sponsibility for protecting private homes on private lands.
The first of these two issues is largely one of scale and priority—how much fuel re-
duction is needed, and where. While substantially a fire science question, economics
certainly has a role in such analysis and decision-making. Furthermore, this returns to the
question of goals and priorities raised at the outset.
The second issue, however, cuts to the core of wildfire management (and most other
governmental action)—responsibility for funding and for results. Traditionally, federal
agencies were only responsible for wildfires on federal lands (plus lands protected under
negotiated cooperative agreements); states had the primary responsibility for wildfire pro-
tection on state and private lands (including most of the WUI). Over time, especially
with the development/expansion of the WUI, federal responsibility for wildland fire pro-
tection has evolved to include initial attack on fires that threaten homes near federal
lands. This was partly a result of firefighting capacity, but also a recognition of funding
capacity—the feds have always been seen as having a bottomless pit of money, particu-
larly since funds for “emergencies” are not counted under annual budget caps, while
nearly all states are constrained to balanced budgets by their state constitutions. In 1995,
the FS and BLM revised their federal wildland fire policy to make it clear that states had
primary (and exclusive) responsibility for wildfire protection on state and private lands,
including homes in the WUI. The states (via the National Association of State Foresters)
expressed serious doubts over their ability to fully absorb this responsibility, at least in the
short run, and the federal agencies acknowledged that they would not ignore fires on
state and private lands, while asserting that the states would have to improve their capaci-
ties for initial attack on wildfires in the WUI.
Rather than contracting, as might have been expected under the 1995 policy, federal
responsibilities and funding seem to have expanded. Federal wildfire funding for pre-
paredness and “basic” (non-emergency) firefighting on federal lands doubled in the wake
of the severe 2000 fire season. Federal assistance to state and local governments for
firefighting more than tripled (to nearly $100 million annually), while a new federal

ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
63
assistance program was established for communities affected by the fires in 2000, in addi-
tion to the existing Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster relief programs.
There has been little information upon which to base rational decisions about fire financ-
ing, and as a result, the U.S. Government has spent, and continues to spend, billion of
dollars on the problem; the conventional myth is that “the government pours money on
the fires until they go out.”
Research is needed—lots of research on lots of different aspects of the problem. Re-
search is needed on costs and effectiveness of various efforts—for preparedness, for fuel
reduction, for initial attack, and for large-fire suppression—to inform public decisions
about feasible goals and priorities. Research is needed to assess the consequences of alter-
native organizational and financing structures for wildfire management—for prepared-
ness, for fuel reduction, for initial attack, and for large-fire suppression. The research
needs to reflect the vast array of natural ecosystems and socio-economic conditions (e.g.,
landownership patterns and government responsibilities), with the understanding that a
wide variety of “answers” might be appropriate—that there is no “silver bullet,” no single,
simple solution.

Manager’s Response
Steven Eubanks
USDA Forest Service, Tahoe National Forest
Thank you for inviting me to share with you one Forest Supervisor’s perspective on the
challenges of managing public lands. I’ve always enjoyed spending time with researchers.
One of my first postings as a district ranger was on a district with an experimental forest.
I found that I benefitted and enjoyed my interactions with these scientists not just for the
new knowledge they could share, but also for their different ways of looking at things.
Coming to this meeting has reminded me of how much I enjoy that exchange.
I’ve been thinking about what I’d like my legacy to be as a public land manager, and
I’ve come to the conclusion that I think I’d like to be remembered as someone who
worked regularly to arrive at a consensus on how the public lands should be managed. I
believe we can reach this consensus by talking about general goals, by working collabor-
atively to develop desired future conditions of our forests, and by focusing on promoting
and sustaining healthy forest ecosystems.
When we talk about building consensus we know that it’s much easier to accom-
plish at smaller more local scales than broader scales. At the project level, we know a lot
about how to work collaboratively and build consensus because of the work of social sci-
entists. At the project level you’re working one-on-one with people, working on building
the relationships necessary to achieve consensus. It’s easy to go out on the ground, to ac-
tually look at the areas the project will affect, and to talk sensibly about our project
options.
However, sometimes even at the project level there are times when you need to find
a way to handle the radical fringe. This may necessitate marginalizing those radical,
fringe individuals, remembering that although you may need to marginalize individuals,
you don’t want to just dismiss radical ideas either—remember Copernicus. Even though
we know how to accomplish project-level consensus, we don’t do it well and we don’t do
it consistently.
Reaching consensus at the forest plan level is very tough. We had a process outlined
in the Sierra Nevada Framework that held the promise of being truly collaborative. The
first meeting in Davis, California drew nearly 350 people representing a broad range of
interests—these were people who were very knowledgeable and willing to contribute and
work within the process outlined. However, Forest Service leadership changed, and we
lost the commitment to a collaborative process. We then reverted to a traditional Forest
Service planning approach, with much of the work being done by an agency planning
team. The planning team pops in and out of its planning hole to update us on progress,
but we’ve lost any thought of a truly collaborative process. People believed that with the
Sierra Nevada Framework everything was in place to move toward consensus through
collaboration, but we moved away from Framework. Why?

Humans, Fires, and Forests
66
One reason we shy away from collaborative processes is that we’ve learned how one
person can believe so strongly in their position that they sabotage the process. It’s not that
they think their position can win, they just want to be sure that the other position doesn’t
win either. Often they win by default just by stalling the process. This is what one re-
porter calls “tyranny of the minority.”
Perhaps one of the biggest hurdles we face in public land management is a basic
reality in our system today, the judicial system. Even when we have broad support for a
process or outcome, one unsatisfied individual can take the issue to the courts and, with
the unsympathetic judges we deal with (some would say hostile to the government), we
lose on technicalities and the project is sidelined. There are literally dozens of technicali-
ties and more come to light every week, so determined individuals have an advantage.
The frustrating thing is that their challenges or the court decisions often have no real
connection with the merits or quality of the project on-the-ground.
One other point I’d like to raise about public land management has to do with
members of our society taking personal responsibility for our choices and their conse-
quences. This includes taking responsibility for where we chose to build our homes, and
taking steps to help manage the wildfire risk. When we look at the expanding wildland-
urban interface, we know that wildland firefighters cannot protect the wealth of diverse
benefits found in our forests if they are protecting homes. Somehow we need to get across
the message that people must take personal responsibility for their property. Who takes
care of the water values and wildlife habitat if we are protecting private property? There is
no “insurance” for resources like there is for homes—so if we lose clean water or wildlife
habitat, it can’t be quickly replaced.
The responsibility message also includes taking responsibility for the impacts of our
patterns of consumption. As an agency, we have become almost apologetic about timber
products coming from our management. In California, over 75 percent of our forest
products come from somewhere else. We can no longer ignore this fact, and need to have
a dialogue about what this means for our public lands and forests around the globe. Sus-
tainable management is a must, but we have to get beyond simplistic statements about
“preserving” our forests.
Finally, I would like to also state one worry I have in focusing only on fire in ses-
sions like this one. I think there’s a danger that we can lose the ability to manage forests if
we give the impression that we should only manage them if there is some connection
with fire protection. I am becoming worried that our focus on wildfire management has
shifted our priorities away from our true mission, to manage forests for sustainable,
healthy ecosystems.

Synopses: Breakout Sessions
Compiled by

Individuals _____________________________________________________________________
• Individuals are embedded in social and cultural contexts and this
understanding is needed in order to motivate behavior. It is not enough to just
measure perceptions, attitudes and distribute persuasion brochures.
• Individuals are effective agents of change if they have appropriate resources
and rewards. One way to connect with individuals is through their networks
and by paying attention to cultural relevance.
• There is a disconnect in expectations of locus of responsibility for risk
management and protection between agencies and homeowners.
• What we know about “who” is out there in the wildland-urban interface is
based on conventional wisdom—need to be more precise in understanding.
• Where and how do individuals access information, and how do they sort
through conflicting information?
• We can measure and know a lot about individual attitudes and knowledge, but
not nearly enough about behavior. Behavior may modify attitudes. So, what
are the mechanisms of behavior change, how do they work, and why are they
effective?
• Base federal fire management on improving natural landscape and ecosystem
management rather than scaring homeowners into action.
• What is the appeal of “forest health” vs. “fire risk”? Making this distinction
can help clarify public information and interaction.
• Individuals do not process risk in the same way professionals do (heuristics
vs. probabilistic).
• Assumption of rationality ignores the emotional aspect of fire and can affect
communication.

Humans, Fires, and Forests
68
• Identify and remove barriers to social learning within a community.
• Incentives for reducing risk—is the money being applied towards the right
actions?
• Individual motivations for living in high risk areas and their adaptation
strategies given their awareness of risk. Is the individual looking outward from
his/her structure to the landscape, or looking inward toward the structure from
the landscape.
Communities ___________________________________________________________________
• The meaning of community has so many definitions which is confusing for
managers and agencies. Fire is a spatial event, so default is spatial definition of
community. In this way, community is often defined as a specific entity versus
an “interactional field.” How are these two definitions related and how do
these dual definitions affect the way resource managers define “community
involvement.” Perhaps one way in which they differentiate is the “agency”
within the community—motivations, rationale for action.
• Natural resource managers are part of communities—but don’t know how to
study and engage them. The default is the rational actor model which focuses
on individuals and community as an aggregation of individuals. Need help in
defining community in different ways and engaging each definition in
different ways.
• There are many myths and romanticizations of communities. One key point
is that community is a social construct and is engaged in social construction
of reality. External forces change communities (e.g., in-migration, fire,
economic downturns), which in turn change how community is constructed
and constructs. This is key in the context of increasing focus on community in
natural resources management. For example, fire can galvanize or fragment
communities. We need to know why. Fire also affects community identity and
experience—which affects how communities engage in future decisions about
fire and forest management. Perhaps it makes more sense to define
“communities at risk” as ones with the least amount of capacity/capital to
respond positively to fire events.
• “Fire Adapted Communities” is a useful concept for creating a typology for
managers. From a biophysical perspective, it allows managers to assess the
physical risks fire posses to the community. From a social science perspective it
allows managers and communities to assess levels of capacity, readiness, or
“agency” to create defensible space, institute landscape treatments, and/or
other necessary steps.

ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
69
• One trend that we may be seeing is that people’s quest for community is a
choice for many populations moving into the wildland-urban interface.
Community institutions are more fluid (e.g., “binge-volunteerism,” “thin”).
People are not necessarily forced to engage in traditional community
institutions (“thick”) like schools, Scouts, churches, etc.. NR managers need to
identify and figure out how to work with these new emergent community
institutions.
• Diffusion and adoption of innovations is an extremely valuable concept to
wildfire and community preparedness. There exist accepted methods that can
be readily shared with managers.
Fire Across the Gradient ________________________________________________________
• We need to move past isolating “fire social science” as its own distinct form.
It is an integral part of sustainable natural resource management.
• Biological gradients may not be useful for social gradients, such as rural 
urban. This gradient is not a uniform continuum—different fire regimes,
vegetative communities, population size, proximity to urban centers, length of
residence, social capital, etc. Differentiation across gradients may not fit into
policy, which creates a paradox: do not simplify or use generic descriptors.
BUT…this creates problems for agencies which need to know how to proceed
across the entire organization.
• Thinking in terms of “gradients” is important so that we can avoid the pitfalls
of false dichotomies or classifications (e.g., definition of WUI). However, care
must be taken because the gradient concept may not be universally
appropriate.
• There is a need to integrate existing and new data (e.g., census, USFS
inventory, plus ethnographies, focus groups) into studies that utilize social and
biological conditions. Use a matrix format, for example: (Biological
conditions) X (Social conditions). New social data for the cells can be
generated by ethnographies, key focus groups, surveys, etc. There is a need to
use same methods across regions to develop comparisons. Funding agencies
can use such a matrix as evaluation criteria to leverage cross-gradient research.
We also need to develop research plans where work accretes to a larger body of
knowledge.
• Cutting across gradients implies a collaborative process, whether it is
disciplinary, organizational, or environmental. First and foremost, increased/
adequate resources will enhance both the quality/reliability of studies and the

Humans, Fires, and Forests
70
ability to communicate information to stakeholders (e.g., publicly elected
officials). But regarding collaboration itself, there is a need to revisit roles,
expectations, and accountability across all involved—managers, public
stakeholders, and researchers. Collaboration should not be confused with
consensus. Collaboration may be more useful as a social learning process than
a decisional process. But there is a tendency among resource managers to think
of collaboration is a means to achieve a consensus around a preferred decision.
There is a historically-rooted mistrust that we need to pay attention to up-
front in any collaborative process. Lastly, cutting across all collaborative efforts
to sustain natural resources is an unspoken paradigm of consumerism;
historically, stakeholders simply demand more from resource managers and
expect them to continue to produce/protect resource values. Stakeholders need
to take more responsibility at the same time they are placing demands.
• The scale of analysis needs to correspond to the scale of the issue/problem.
A one size fits all concept is not appropriate for dealing with complex/“wicked”
issues and problems. By extension, centralized/hierarchical approaches may not
be appropriate for all situations (such as community-based
initiatives/collaborations).
• Appropriate scales for different processes. Collaboration may be appropriate
at the neighborhood and landscape scale but what happens to the decision-
making process when it is moved to the national scale? Are there other
processes that are more appropriate or do we default to traditional processes
(e.g., litigation, rational planning) when in fact they may produce less desirable
outcomes?
• There is a need to understand how to embrace uncertainty and stochasticity
in resource management decision-making. Adaptive management offers one
important perspective—especially the emphasis on experimentation and
learning. One concept that needs to be revisited is “desired future
conditions”—it implies a singular, static future that may be unrealistic and sets
up agencies for “failure” for not achieving desired future conditions due to
unforeseen circumstances (stochastic events).
• The focus on public lands fire management needs to broaden to recognize
private land neighbors. It may be that the greatest challenges to public land
management are the rapid changes occurring on adjacent private lands—
parcelization, demographics of owners, etc.

ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
71
Culture and Ethnicity ___________________________________________________________
• Within the realm of culture and ethnicity there is a need to share with
managers the sensitivities regarding communication, research methods, and
other forms of interaction. This will require a reorganization of how managers
view formal and informal elements of community. It will also require a
reorganization of our notions of within and between group memberships.
Within groups we cannot assume homogeneity in attitudes, values, and
behaviors. Between groups we cannot assume transferability of research
methods, means of communication, or the values. Resource managers (and
social science researchers) must begin working with the multiple groups to
understand their perspectives. They also need to develop and apply multiple
strategies for interacting with multiple publics.
• A one size fits all concept is not appropriate for dealing with
complex/”wicked” issues and problems.
• One way for resource managers and researchers to understand culture is
through the concept of identity.
• Claiming a way of knowing about land, resource, etc. defines identity.
• Certain environmental attributes and practices are integral to producing and
re-producing cultural identities.
• Land management decisions inevitably either foster or impinge upon cultural
identities. This may explain in part how/why environmental conflicts are so
emotional and deep-seated.
• Acknowledging the indigenous role in what we consider “natural” opens the
door to recognizing the role of humans’ management of the ecosystem.
Policy, Political, and Institutional _______________________________________________
• There is a universal perception that existing political/governmental institutions
and processes are not working. The hierarchical, military structure of fire
suppression has implications for communities and public participation in
general. Other factors include: contracting, “analysis paralysis,” the sole focus
on fire suppression and fuels reduction. There are two indicators that the
institutions and processes are not working: appeals and litigation—they are
often the only courses of communication. Furthermore, the training by
agencies does not match well with new challenges, especially in the context of
downsizing and bureaucratic inertia. More training is needed for agencies in

Humans, Fires, and Forests
72
terms of communication as well as allocating skills relative to changing
demands.
• Conventional wisdom might suggest that certain groups are more litigious
than others regarding forest management. Congress reacts to this “wisdom” in
the form of policy change. The role of social science is to inform policy by
proving or disproving the conventional wisdom and not just accepting current
problem definitions to guide our research.
• There exist multiple definitions and dimensions of the wildland-urban
interface that is context driven (i.e., no-one-size-fits-all) and is dependent
upon varying biophysical characteristics as well as social characteristics and
values.
• The budget forces all subordinate structures to adapt to its logic. Institutional
and budgetary structures do not correspond to on-the-ground problems, which
are complex and require flexibility. Similarly, centralized/hierarchical
approaches may not be appropriate for all situations (such as community-based
initiatives/collaborations). But we can not implement flexibility in institutional
and budget structures without agreeing on the mechanisms for achieving
accountability for outcomes.
 e.g., interagency cooperation for sustaining natural resources requires
flexibility, but is difficult to achieve because of dispersed accountability.
 e.g., agencies can not spend dollars allocated to fire use (prescribed burning
for fuels reduction) to achieve resource management goals.
• Increased/adequate resources will enhance both the quality/reliability of
studies and the ability to communicate information to stakeholders (e.g.,
publicly elected officials). We also need people on the management side to
transmit what we know. Technology transfer can be more of a face-to-face
dialogue, but we also need to find more ways to express the benefits of social
science research.
 e.g., Fire Information Officers and Fire Marshall's Offices need
information about variations in community responses they can expect during a
fire, and the social needs after a fire.
• “Stovepiping” fire management separate from natural resource management
might amplify this problem of rigid institutional/budgetary structures. The
question is: who wins and who loses from such a structure (e.g., fire use
benefits “early seral constituents” like cattle, elk, some kinds of birds). In fact,
the kinds of institutions we have established such as the National Fire Plan
may affect who “wins” and “loses” in some communities.

ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
73
• Institutional reward systems both in agencies and universities encourage
certain research questions and management outcomes that tend to emphasize
how to efficiently achieve a goal, without questioning the goal itself. The irony
is that there is quite a lot of research dollars available, but they are not for
questions the agency does not want addressed. There is a premium on
protocols and templates, which are efficient, but the goals themselves are
taken-for-granted.
The Merging of Management and Science ______________________________________
Barriers to Manager/Science Merging —
• Manager access to research and researchers
• Cultural differences
• Promotion and tenure "boogie man"
• Narrow definitions of scholarly productivity
• Technology transfer not valued

What Did We Accomplish? ______________________________________________________
• Understand more about each other and the ongoing work in humans, fire and
forests.
• Learned of the current need to apply social science and some strategies to cross
the manager/scientist boundary.
• Recognized many of the barriers regarding the application of social science:
1) Our own recognition of complexity and the contextual nature of
problem solving make it difficult for research to “accrete.”
2) Social science findings reveal difficult normative tensions. Fire is both
good and bad:
• Fire is good for the ecosystem.
• Fire is good because it brings dollars to firefighters and rural communities.
• Fire is good for firefighting institutions. It brings clarity of purpose,
organizational cohesion, and confidence in the staff—plus huge budgets
and stories to tell.
• The media loves fire—drama, visuals, and heroes.
• Fire is bad because it is destructive and dangerous. Firefighters die, houses
burn, aesthetics change, smoke is created. It is also enormously expensive.
• Because of the significance of context, social science will continue to be
important to address this normative tension by asking when and where is
fire good or bad, and particularly, for whom is it good or bad and why?
3) Social science also reveals difficult policy disconnects, especially regarding
actual roles of actors and the official statements of responsibility:
• There is a social contract for agencies to protect private property, even
though the responsibility officially is to protect resources.
• The cost of fighting fires is not associated with other agency
responsibilities, except to become a threat to normal operating budgets.
• There are difficulties in addressing ecosystem or landscape level conditions
affecting fire when social organization adheres to “jurisdictions.” The
ability to clarify boundary responsibilities remains as a continuous
challenge. Plus, there are different goals among those proprietary interests
across the landscape for the management of the forest.

Humans, Fires, and Forests
78
4) We can’t separate the institutional behaviors from the policy
environment. We also have to recognize the barriers presented by societal
tensions for the purpose of public forests.
Where Do We Go From Here? ___________________________________________________
• Develop a framework for the integration of fire social science into sustainable
forest management (“common language”).
1) Matrix presented in the morning (critical gradients: characteristics and
how they are applied geographically)
2) Meta-analysis is possible
3) Event driven model of social science measurements and analysis based on
• Before fire event-preparedness at different social scales
• During the fire-what managers do in addition to putting out the fire.
• Post fire-recovery and linking fire to sustainable forest management.
• Foster communications protocols among ourselves and between managers
and scientists
1) Personal relationships of convenience
2) Regularly scheduled meetings of social scientists
3) Marketing, promotional materials
4) Questionnaires and responses to managers
5) Clearinghouse of research and researchers
• Advance a series of “Sesame Street” findings; the simple principles of how
social science makes a contribution. Not only the principles, but explanations
and descriptions of how these principles function in real world examples, such
as:
1) There are disconnects between people’s attitudes and behaviors. Surveys
might say that people want to have a fire-wise property, but they do not
actually do it. This also allows us to explain the limitations of social science
tools.
2) Adoption of new behaviors is affected by the action of peers. We know a
great deal about the diffusion model. It leads directly to implementation
programs to reduce fire risks via fuel treatments. For example, apply a
project at the neighborhood scale, rent a chipper for a group of neighbors
to use.

ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
79
3) Organizations and bureaucracies strive for efficiency and standardization.
They move toward rigidity. As Incident Command teams have matured,
they are predisposed to be insensitive to local needs. There is a trade-off
between efficiency and adaptability.
4) People have limited attention spans and cognitive capacities. Public
meetings and collaborative processes can’t last forever.
5) People respond to positive incentives. They might treat their properties
based on a desire to reconstruct naturalness and to obtain a desirable
aesthetic.
• By developing a few well crafted “stories” of how well-researched social
science principles have been applied, researchers can help managers
recognize that the story isn’t a recipe, but an inspiration for their own action.
Who Is To Do This? ______________________________________________________________
Who is to do this and the various roles to be played need to be negotiated on the basis of
the specifics of each organizational environment.

Summary Report

University of Wisconsin-Madison
The January 2003 Humans, Fire, and Forests meeting was convened to discuss the role of
social science in fire research and management. As indicated by Hanna Cortner, Don
Field, and Pam Jakes earlier in these proceedings, the magnitude of the wildfire problem,
the large infusion of research funds, and heightened research interest in the study of fire
presents both a critical need and opportunity for collaborative social science research on
fire. In response, forty participants from academic institutions, federal research and man-
agement agencies, and independent organizations gathered in Tucson for three days to
share ideas about relevant, applied, social science research on fire. Interest in collabora-
tions among researchers and managers on the relationships of people and wildland fire
were central to these discussions.
Five theme papers and presentations were offered: Individuals; community; fire
across gradients; culture and ethnicity; policy, political, and institutional issues. After
these theme presentations, perspectives from management and policy makers were
offered on how social science can assist public land mangers in working with people on a
broad range of resource management issues, including fire. Following these presentations,
breakout groups met to discuss each of these themes and synthesize and distill fundamen-
tal points where social science plays a role and to highlight potential research outcomes.
The discussions indicated considerable integration across perspectives and subject matter.
Attendees found considerable common ground.
Thematic Presentations _________________________________________________________
Individuals: Terry Daniel (University of Arizona) presented a psychological perspective
on the role of individuals in fire risk management. He contrasted technical assessments of
probabilities of damage over space and time with public values and motivations regarding
acceptance of fire risk. Risk awareness and perceptions of hazards are part of a larger
context of value tradeoffs. The psychology of fire prevention and suppression differs from
the more contemporary psychology of fuel management where multiple motivations
come together to influence individual actions. He offered an alternative amalgamation of
low hazard, good ecology, and high beauty motivations to move beyond the traditional,
narrower frame of fear and safety for individual action.

Humans, Fires, and Forests
82
Communities: Matt Carroll (Washington State University) and Steve Daniels (Utah
State University) emphasized the dynamic relationship between community and fire.
They established that our traditional examination of the effects of fire on communities
needs to be balanced by an understanding of the reverse relationship. Fire is a socially
constructed concept formed by the interactions between social institutions and complex
events. These social constructions of fire affect recovery behavior within communities.
Longitudinal studies, consisting of pre-fire, during fire, and post-fire experiences of par-
ticular communities, and multiple methods are needed to appreciate the feedback from
the transformations and outcomes of community capacity which affect fire conditions.
Fire across the Gradient: Barbara Morehouse (University of Arizona) explored the
use of gradients as an organizing concept for facilitating interdisciplinary research. A
method was presented that bridged biophysical conditions (e.g., biomes, climate, and to-
pography) with comparative studies across multiple levels of analysis using multiple per-
spectives and theories. Using this framework, scientists and managers can better identify
and understand similarities and differences in the complex web of people, community
and fire. One example of this methodology is discussed in more detail later.
Culture and Ethnicity: Carol Raish (USDA Forest Service-Albuquerque, NM) and
Armando González-Cabán (USDA Forest Service-Riverside, CA) linked historical and
contemporary perspectives to an exploration of fire use, management practices, and atti-
tudes across and within cultural and ethnic groups. Central to their discussion was the
notion that what happens on federal land affects adjacent land and vice versa. In the
context of multiple ownership and values of forest resources, culturally sensitive research
is needed to look beyond impacts to improvement and collaboration. In the name of re-
spectful and fair representation across cultural and ethnic groups and/or constituents, the
transfer of information, in both directions, is facilitated by use of innovative methods
that involve local research partners.
Policy, Political, and Institutional: Tony Cheng (Colorado State University) and
Hanna Cortner (Northern Arizona University) suggested that we needed to pay increased
attention to both the context and the nature of problems related to fire as they are con-
stantly changing. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that fire institutions are typi-
cally based upon outdated assumptions of problems and on the notion of rational action.
Not surprisingly, there is a “disconnect” between federal and local priorities. Despite the
merits of public collaboration being well known, the hierarchical fire industrial complex
is not geared toward high public involvement. They asserted that positional rhetoric is
systematic of a larger environmental policy and management debate.
Manager and Policy Responses: Ross Gorte (Congressional Research Service) high-
lighted the fact that wildfire management goals are not always compatible and are often
ambiguous in application. The costs, benefits, and feasibility of fire reduction and pre-
vention programs are not well understood. Policy is often based upon conventional

ERI Papers in Restoration Policy
83
wisdom drawn from biased expertise and rarely reflects the diversity of contexts in which
fire is experienced. For example, there is a divergence between urban fire experience and
wildland fire experience, suggesting that clarity is needed to articulate appropriate respon-
sibilities and priorities for effective fire management.
Steve Eubanks (USDA Forest Service-Tahoe National Forest) addressed the problem
of reaching consensus regarding fire and forest management. While consensus is easier to
reach at the project level by marginalizing the radical fringe, consensus at the forest plan
scale is tougher. Eubanks lamented the power of minority interests with nothing to lose.
In addition, the role of personal responsibility was raised as an important theme. A dis-
connect between public expectations and personal consumption has led to competing in-
terests. Reframing the issue around sustainable management of healthy forests may help
to bring the role of personal responsibility and product consumption into focus with fire
management.
Discussion ______________________________________________________________________
A number of central themes arose in the thematic discussions. The concepts of context
and scale were seen as important for framing specific areas of contribution. There was
broad recognition that appropriate levels and units of analysis should be articulated for
different problems. For example, the development of fire management plans might be
handled at the county level, whereas project implementation and interaction with land-
owners might be more successfully focused on a community or neighborhood scale.
Moreover, the adoption of a multiple-method framework for addressing fire problems
was seen as necessary to uncover contextual differences across space and time and also to
engage in collaborative research.
There was general agreement that a framework or organizing matrix was needed for
the conduct of these studies. This matrix would be built around the variety of gradients
and thematic intersections associated with the human dimensions of fire, as well as fire’s
biophysical considerations. A preliminary outline for such a matrix is offered at the end
of this summary.
A recurring theme throughout the meeting was that many of the assumptions made
about the human dimensions of fire are based upon conventional wisdom. Since such as-
sumptions often play important roles in shaping policy and the implementation of man-
agement decisions, social science has an obligation to test them. Concern over the false
application of conventional wisdom was raised in a number of contexts: (1) Who actually
resides in the wildland-urban interface? (e.g., what are their socio-demographic character-
istics?); (2) how are communities affected by fire, and how do they affect fire?; (3) what
are the repercussions of the assumptions of homogeneity across cultural and ethnic
groups and how do they affect our ability to generalize findings?; and (4) how do we
properly reach conclusions about the social impacts, costs, and benefits of fire
management?

Humans, Fires, and Forests
84
Concomitantly, a number of disconnects were highlighted that have led to conster-
nation and frustration on the part of researchers and managers alike:
• Federal objectives vs. local priorities
• Organizational and jurisdictional aspects of fire management vs.
interactional aspects of community
• Knowledge and perception vs. behavior and action
• Technical knowledge vs. local perception and knowledge
• Spending directives vs. opportunity costs in a larger context
• Probability of damage vs. individual and community values
The notion of rationality in decision making and actions was questioned and the le-
gitimacy of social constructions of meanings of fire and community were highlighted as
having significant influence. Local and historical experience was seen as playing an im-
portant role in the creation of community narratives and identity. Experience and iden-
tity were seen as influencing decision-making and the impacts of and for fire.
Fire was seen as both a galvanizing issue (as therapeutic aspects of community
emerge) and as a disintegrating factor (as priorities clash leading to litigation and general
disagreement). A need was articulated to look at variations in attitudes and practices,
both across and within cultural and ethnic groups, as well as across society. Sensitivity is
crucial, both in research and in collaborative management of forest resources and fire
issues. Collaboration and technology transfer were repeated areas of discussion and many
different methods and examples were raised.
The adoption and diffusion of innovations was seen as a function of community ca-
pacity. However, the costs, benefits, and feasibility of different decisions and policies were
not seen to be well understood. The political dimensions of fire issues were discussed in-
cluding the constant presence and power of rhetoric.
A number of meaningful outputs will be generated as a result of this conference and
efforts are being made to connect the efforts here to other forums for further discussion
and collaboration. Subgroups have been formed to discuss the framework or matrix
across fire issues as well as the production of contextual anecdotes/narratives that illumi-
nate the intersections of critical issues as experienced in practice. Workshop proceedings
and summaries will be disseminated and a special issue of Society and Natural Resources
will be devoted to the meeting themes. A website is being developed to allow for further
interaction among researchers and managers and will include an outline of individual and
collaborative research interests. Upcoming meetings will provide venues for continued
discussion, including panel presentations at the 2003 Natural Hazards Workshop, the
2004 International Symposium on Society and Resource Management (ISSRM)
meetings, and a 2004 conference in Madrid regarding fire economics and strategic fire
planning and management.

Conclusion: Towards A Matrix Approach for Social Science Contributions to
Applied Fire Management ______________________________________________________
The range of issues and concerns identified by the attendees suggested a need for some
organizing mechanism for social science research associated with fire management. Too
many incompatible studies have been and are being conducted which prohibit an accre-
tion of findings. This is traced to the absence of a common methodological frame. To
help address this issue, and because it is impractical and prohibitively expensive to mount
a study of all forest-fire situations in the nation, the group opted to use a typological
framework to identify case studies. A typology is an abstraction of reality that allows the
researcher to maximize similarities while minimizing differences among a set of cases.
This facilitates analysis in that representative cases can be identified for in-depth study.
Typologies are used to organize data; they represent a conceptual model useful for
guiding research and developing policy.
Our typology of the human/fire intersection relies on the identification of several
key dimensions: (1) Biophysical conditions (including land use and cover; topography;
climate; and soils); (2) socio-demographics (including population size and characteristics;
migration; densities; development patterns; and housing characteristics); (3) social, cul-
tural, and ethnic considerations (including patterns of use; jurisdictional relationships;
traditions; attitudes; perceptions; organizations; and institutions). Embedded within, and
integrated across each of these dimensions, are concerns about fire experiences, levels and
units of analysis, public policy, and property-rights issues. Moreover, temporal and spatial
dimensions are seen as critical.
Utilization of a typology helps provide a resource-based coherence to help frame
multiple sets of criteria (e.g., regional, strategic, and/or ethnic differences in response to
fire threats and emergencies) for analysis. Proper conduct of studies using this typology
would require the use of a multi-method protocol, one based on both qualitative and
quantitative techniques, as well a plurality of theoretical approaches. As a result of using
this set of core vectors, studies would be compatible and nested, and as a result would
make a more significant contribution to our knowledge. The accompanying figure on
page 86 provides a heuristic model of this typology. We view this typology as a useful
framework for organizing the heterogeneous characteristics of fire management, both for
the wildland-urban interface and in a much broader, societal level context.
It is hoped that the preliminary matrix described above can initiate further discus-
sion about how a collaborative research process can be framed. By linking our research
both within and across specific cells and dimensions, we can begin to accrete our collec-
tive knowledge and offer a rich and coherent framework for applied social science and
fire research.

Dissertation research - Sustainable Responses to Human Ecological Crisis on the Mogollon Rim,
Arizona: includes the topic of wildland-urban interface fire hazard—specifically, second home
development and the relationship between the Phoenix Metropolis and the production of environmental
crises on the Rim, with an explicit consideration of both human and environmental spatial and temporal
trends. Social science questions: 1) what are the individual and group characteristics of Mogollon Rim
landscape stakeholders and how do these characteristics map over space; 2) what are the constraints
placed on the transfer of stakeholder human ecological knowledge into sustainable actions; 3) What
can be done to increase knowledge and minimize constraints?
Thesis research - Individuals and Wildland-Urban Interface Fire Hazard:
Based on a survey of wildland-urban interface homeowners in a Sierra Nevada foothill community, and
focused on environmental values, hazard perceptions, and property level adjustments to fire hazard.
Findings: the values that attracted residents were essentially those that produce extreme fire hazards;
residents typically underestimated what is in actuality extreme hazard; in general, residents did not
made the adjustments needed to minimize risks on their properties; specifically, lower income and
renting residents had similar hazard perceptions but made less fire-safe adjustments than higher
income and home owning residents; residents of larger parcels were not capable of effectively
managing vegetation on their properties.

Current research - Research on whether culture/ethnicity affects individuals’ and communities’ attitudes
and perceptions toward fuels reduction programs; also whether the vehicle of survey implementation
affects response rates and willingness to pay for such programs. Doing additional work on
decision-making processes in wildfire suppression events, particularly by incident commanders.
Previous research with paper surveys and telephone interviews have shown that there is support for
the implementation of many of the fuel treatment programs. I have started a new line of research trying
to determine whether the vehicle of survey implementation (a video versus telephone interview) affects
response rates and willingness to pay for different fuel treatments programs.
Problem of the high risk of wildfire damage in the urban wildlife interface: Currently there is no
procedure to evaluate the economic implications of risk mitigation factors in the urban-wildlife interface.
A new project using conjoint analysis to evaluate the economic trade-offs associated with wildfire risk
reduction in the urban-wildlife interface was started. One major problem facing wildland fire managers
is the ever increasing cost of fire suppression. Managers are trying to find better ways to control these
expenditures, which requires understanding the decision processes during a wildfire event. An
approach for representing wildfire incidents is to codify them in terms of decision modeling techniques.
The formal representation of a fire incident could identify the various options that appeared open to the
decision maker(s), the information at hand, the sources of uncertainty, the values at risk, the trade-offs
inherent in the problem, and the potential outcomes ensuing from various courses of action. This
research proposes development of a decision modeling approach for analyzing wildland fire incidents.

Current Research - Diffusion of Innovative Fire Planning: Communities Sharing Strategies to Reduce
Risk and Loss from Catastrophic Fires: With Victoria Sturtevant, Southern Oregon Univ., and Sarah
McCaffrey, NCRS, Evanston to looking at successful community-focused wildfire education programs.
Interest is in how features of fire programs (e.g., simplicity and divisibility) interact with social and
ecological settings (e.g., social capital and fire frequency), and measuring success via changes in
homeowner perception of risk and preparedness behavior (e.g., creation of defensible space) and
adoption by the community (planning for wildfire). Programs being considered for inclusion in the study
include TNC Fire Learning Network, FireWise Communities, FireSafe Councils, FireFree, and the
Student Conservation Association.
Managing Fire Across Boundaries—Essential Elements For Collaboration: Applied for JFS funding to
work on identifying essential elements of successful collaborative wildfire management, and developing
tools to build and sustain these relationships. To accomplish these tasks we will conduct six case
studies addressing research questions about critical collaborative activities such as: 1) developing
outreach, 2) building relationships, 3) conducting civic science, 4) managing across boundaries, 5)
sustaining collaborative efforts, and, 6) developing indicators of success.
Previous Research - Community Preparedness for Wildfire: Study funded by the National Fire Plan to
identify the activities communities are undertaking to increase wildfire preparedness and to identify the
resources necessary to support these activities; 15 cases across the country in communities that range
in preparedness and resources from OR and WA to MN and WI to NY and NJ to FL and TX.

Current and developing interests -I have been working with Pam Jakes and others on a community
capacity and fire preparedness study. I am interested in innovation and adoption of new ideas and
approaches. What are the conditions that enable innovation and that enable diffusion and adoption of
those ideas in other locations. I am also interested in exploring the use of different public participation
processes in developing and implementing treatment plans. This research could be done as a
companion to bio-physical research studying difference applications on the ground.
Titles and clarifying questions:
1) Community Capacity and Fire Preparedness. What are the conditions, factors, qualities that enable
and facilitate community action?
2) Innovation, adoption and diffusion of fire preparedness activities. What conditions facilitate
innovation and community action and how do new ideas take wing and sprout in additional locations?
3) Public participation in fuels treatment projects. How successful are different approaches to public
participation used in conjunction with fuels treatment planning and does public participation contribute
to development and implementation of fuels reduction programs and if so how?
Previous/current fire social science work:
I have been working with Pam Jakes, Vicky Sturtevant, Kristen Nelson, and Martha Monroe, Shruti
Agrawal, and Erika Lang (Pam Jakes is PI) on a community preparedness study. I have been working
directly with Vicky Sturtevant doing five case studies in Washington, Oregon and Montana.

fire-prone areas and decision processes. This research is being used to inform development of a
web-served geospatial model that produces fire risk maps for strategic planning.
Fire-climate knowledge transfer: I have been actively involved for the past four years in effecting
knowledge transfer between fire managers, fire scientists, and climatologists, with the goal of improving
the production and use of climate information in wildland fire management.
Comparative studies of wildland fire-societal interactions: This is a developing area of interest. I am
interested in conducting research that compares and contrasts fire risk in selected study areas, from
the following perspectives: a) identification of the range of options deemed to be acceptable for
managing for fire risk, b) community identity formation and construction of narratives about fire risk
within the natural landscape of the study areas, and, c) capacity to co-produce science and policy with
regard to wildland fire risk management.
