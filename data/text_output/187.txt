SURVIVAL AND SPROUTING RESPONSES OF CHIHUAHUA PINE
AFTER THE RODEO-CHEDISKI FIRE ON
THE MOGOLLON RIM, ARIZONA
Kenneth H. Baumgartner! and Peter Z. FuIel,2
ABSTRAc r.-Chihuahua pines (Pinus leiophylla Schiede and Depp e var. chihuahuana Engelmann) were surveyed on
11 study plots on the Mogollon Rim in east central Arizona to compare characteristics of trees that sprouted from the
base or root collar after the Rodeo-Chediski fire with those of trees that did not sprout. The differences in trees killed
and top-killed by the fire versus those that survived were also assessed. Trees that sprouted were significantly smaller in
height and diameter at breast height; they also experienced lower fire intensiti es than trees that did not sprout. Smaller
trees had higher incidences of mortality than larger trees. These results indicate that, even though Chih uahua pine has
fire resiliency, sprouting rates after fire are related to size of trees, age of trees, and burn intensity. Since Chihuahua
pine is a rare species in the area studied , its ability to recover from and tolerate fire could prove advantageous for sus-
tainability.

Pinus leiophylla Schiede and Deppe var.
chihuahuana Engelmann (Chihuahua pine) is
one of the few pines that sprout in response to
disturbance. This species can sprout both from
its base (Stone and Stone 1954) and from the
stem or crown (Farjon and Styles 1997). It is
considered a fire-resilient species, having a low
to moderate tolerance to fire but an ability to
regenerate rapidly through the mechanism of
sprouting (McCune 1988). The ability to sprout
is believed to be restricted to young and juve-
nile trees. Of all the North American pines, P.
leiophylla has the best ability to sprout from
the base (McCune 1988). Mature trees have
thick bark (Perry 1991), which may help insu-
late cambial tissue from fire (Pavek 1994).
In the United States, P. leiophylla grows in
southwestern New Mexico and southeas tern
and east central Arizona on dry slopes ranging
from 1524 to 2438 m in elevation (Petrides
1992). Pinus leiophylla is most commonly found
in the mountains of southeastern Arizona;
however, it is rare and sporadic on the Mogol-
lon Rim in east central Arizona (Petrides 1992,
Muldavin et al. 1996).
In east central Arizona, the Rodeo-Chediski
fire burned approximately 189,000 ha in 2002
and was the largest fire recorded in Arizona
(USDA Forest Service 2002). This fire, which
burned portions of the Mogollon Rim, provided
the opportunity to assess post-fire sprouting
characteristics of P. leiophylla in an area where
it is rare, where it is the only pine species in
the area that sprouts following fire, and where
it is at its northern latitudinal limit (Petrides
1992). Considering that large crown fires are
likely to continue occurring in the area (Cov-
ington et al. 1994), response of this population
to fire has significant implications for sustain-
ability of P. leiophylla on the Mogollon Rim.
We asked 3 questions regarding the effects
of fire on basal spro uting of P. leiophylla in
stands burned in the Rodeo-Chediski fire on
the Mogollon Rim: (1) does tree age have an
influence on the ability to resprout; (2) does
fire intensity have an influence on the ability
to resprout; and (3) does tree age have an
influence on survival? We assesse d the results
of this study in the context of P. leiophylla
management.

near Heber, Arizona. The area receives an
average ann ual precipitation of around 44.3
cm and an average annual snowfall of 99.3 em.
Average monthly temperatures range from
-8.9° to 29.3°C, with the minimum occurring
in January and the maximum in July (Western
Regional Climate Center 2004). Average ele-
vation for all study sites was approximately
2092 m ASL (range 2027-2245 m), Soil infor-
mation was derived from a Terrestrial Ecosys-
tem Survey (Laing et al. 1987). Study sites
were located on Udic and Lythic Haplustalfs
(C.A. Nelson, USDA Forest Service, personal
communica tion, 2005), with parent material
derived from alluvium and sandstone. Trees
and shrubs consisted of Chihuahua pine, pon-
derosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.), white fir
(Abies concolor Gord . & Glen.), alligator juni-
per (juniperus deppeana Steud.), Gamb el oak
(Quercus gambelii Nutt.), pointleaf manzanita
(Arctostaphylos pungens Kunth), and Fendler
ceanothus (Ceanothus f endleri Gray).
We selected 11 study plots based on known
locations of P. leiophylla. Plots were located
over a distance of approximately 37 km (Fig.
1). Due to the rarity of P. leiophylla in the area,
it was necessary to locate plots in a subjective
manner. We chose sample plots in areas where
P. leiophylla was in greatest abundance and
made an effort to include a variety of tree sizes
and sprouting responses. Each plot was 50 x
20 m and permanently marked with an iron
stake at the northeast com er. Every P. leio-
plujlla individual was sampled regardless of
size, due to the ability of very young (small)
trees to sprout. For each tree, we measured the
following attributes: condition (live or dead),
diameter at breast height (dbh), total height,
height of live crown base, minimum and maxi-
mum char heights , whether or not the stem
sprouted , and number of basal sprouts. Incre-
ment cores were taken from a subset of trees
to determine ages. We assumed that the major-
ity of charred, recentl y killed trees were killed
by the Rodeo-Chediski fire. We also assumed
char height was correlated positively with flame
length and thus was an approximation of fire-
line inten sity near the individu al trees as in
Agee (1993).
Within each plot, we sampled subplots for
other overstory trees, shrubs, and regeneration.
Oth er overstory tree species were identified
within the northeast quadrant and diameters
at breast height were measured. A 5 x lO-m
shrub plot originating from the northeast cor-
ner was used to tally live and dead shrubs and
tree regeneration. The heights of shrubs and
regeneration were recorded into 3 height
classes: 0-40 cm, 41-80 em, and 81- 137 cm.
We took photos at each plot from the north-
east comer facing into the plot center, UTM
coordinates were recorded at the northeast
com er. Plot aspect and slope were recorded.
Plots were corrected for slope in the field.
Data were analyzed with JMP (release
5.0.1.2; SAS, Inc. , Cary, NC). We compared
characteristics of sprouting and nonsprouting
trees including diameters , total heights, and
minimum and maximum char heights. Diame-
ters of trees that survived the fire and trees
that did not were also compared. Most data
were found to have nonnormal distributions
and unequal variances, but these problems were
corrected with square-root transformati ons.

ters were significantly greater for live trees
than for dead and top-killed trees (t = 6.13, P
< 0.0001; Table 4).
Individu als of P leioph ylla that sprouted
from the base had significantly different char-
acteris tics from those that did not sprout.
Trees with basal sprouts were smaller in dbh
(F = 61.42, P < 0.0001), shorter in total height
(F = 44.50, P < 0.0001), and had lower maxi-
mum char heights (F = 6.31, P = 0.0130) than
trees that did not sprout (Table 5). The major-
ity of trees that sprouted from the base were
in the 0-5-cm diameter class (Fig. 3) and
reflected the distribution of dbh (Fig. 2). The
proportion of sprouting from
dead trees
decreased with increasing dbh (Fig. 3).
R ESULTS
Among living plants in the 11 plots sam-
pled post-fire, P leiophylla and P ponderosa
were codominant. Pinus ponderosa density
was slightly higher than that of P leiophulla,
but basal area was higher for P leiophulla.
There was also a small amount of Juniperus
deppeana and Quercus garnbelii (Tables 1, 2),
both of which were observed to be sprouting
from the base in a mann er similar to P leio-
phylla. Arctostaphylos pungens and Ceanothus
f endleri were the only shrubs we found. Arc-
tostaphylos pungens was the dominant shrub.
We found a positive linear relationship (R2
= 0.6324, Y = 4.493x - 4.2857, P < 0.0001) be-
tween dbh and age of P leiophulla. The oldest
tree dated was 220 years old and the youngest
was 26 years old.
Of all P leiophulla individuals sampled, 34%
spro uted from the base and 61% were top-
killed in the fire. The averages on a per-plot
basis were similar to the average of all trees
sampled (Table 3). The highest mortality rate
of P leiophylla occurred mostly in smaller dbh
classes and was generally lower in larger dbh
classes. There was no mortality in the 30-35-
em or the 35-40-cm classes (Fig. 2). Diame-

DISCUSSION
This study also supports the observation of
Perry (1991) that sprouting of P. leiophulla
occurs mostly in young trees. This poses an
important implication for management of forests
containing this species. To have a favorable
sprouting response to fire, stands of P. leio-
phylla should be managed to ensure that there
are significant number s of trees with diame-
ters at breast height <30 ern.
The observations in this study indicate that
P. leiophulla has certain distinct advantages
compared to other tree species in the area.
Since P. leiophylla is the only sprouting pin e
spe cies on the Mogollon Rim, its ability to
spro ut as a form of regeneration following fire
could be an important advantage over P. pon-
derosa. Because sprouting is not dependent
upon a crop of seeds, P. leiophylla can regen-
erate even when all the trees in an area have
been killed. This ability could potentially mean
the difference between pin es being dominant
in an area after fire ver sus dominan ce of
another tree or shrub species. Pinus leioplujlla
also possesses a degree of fire resistance in
mature trees. Th is may serve as an advantage
over other sprouting species that do not pos-
sess thick bark and are more easily top-killed,
such as oaks.
That P. leiophylla has shown conside rable
rege neration imm ediately after the Rodeo-
Che diski fire has implications for tree diver-
sity on the Mogollon Rim. Cur rently, P. leio-
phylla is a rare species in the area, but given
the advantages mentioned above, it may likely
increase in abundance in the future.
Though this study identified important traits
related to sprouting, more extensive research
should be done on this species to assess the
relationships between bark thickness and tree
age, size, and fire resistance; factors that cause
or influ ence stem and basal sprouting; and
ability of sprouts to produce cones. The height,
growth, and survival of basal sprouts should
be studied over time to assess whe ther post-
fire sprouting translates into mature trees. Also,

Consistent with McCune (1988), P. leio-
phylla demonstrated an ability to resprout
from the base following the Rodeo-Chediski
fire (Fig. 4A, 4C). Sprouting by P. leiophylla
following this fire occur red both from top-
killed trees and from live trees. For top-killed
trees, however, sprouting was not uniform, be-
cause higher char height on trees, indi cating
greater fire intensity (Agee 1993), was associ-
ated with reduced sprouting response. This
suggests that, thou gh P. leiophylla is known to
be resilient to fire, this resilience may be neg-
atively influenced by increased fire intensity.
