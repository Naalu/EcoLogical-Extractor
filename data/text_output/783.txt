The Impacts of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant Program in Eastern Oregon and Eastern Arizona      1
Executive summary
From 2005–10, the USDA Forest Service’s Woody 
Biomass Utilization Grant program provided grants 
for equipment acquisition and technical assistance 
to rural businesses and other entities. These grants 
were intended to encourage enterprise development, 
address market barriers to biomass utilization (rang-
ing from small-diameter sawtimber to chips and log-
ging residues), and decrease forest restoration costs 
by adding value to biomass products. At the request 
of the USDA Forest Service – State and Private For-
estry’s Forest Products Technology Marketing Unit 
at the Forest Products Laboratory, we evaluated the 
impacts of this program in eastern Oregon and east-
ern Arizona (see Table 1, page 2). These areas both 
have extensive public lands, high wildﬁre risk, and 
limited biomass businesses. We analyzed the pro-
gram’s effects on enterprise and industry capacity, 
state economies, and acres treated and green tons 
removed. We found that this relatively small ($5 
million authorized nationwide annually) program’s 
most clear accomplishments were its signiﬁcant con-
tributions to regional biomass processing capacity, 
which occurred despite challenging market and eco-
nomic conditions. Outcomes such as increased acres 
treated and reduced costs were less discernible, and 
there was no concurrent investment in agency ca-
pacity to implement biomass removal projects. Giv-
en the complexities of public land management and 
associated business development, strategies such as 
the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant program are 
critical to increasing biomass utilization, but are 
likely to achieve greater outcomes when incorpo-
rated with other tools to improve federal agency and 
stakeholder capacity, active land management, and 
long-term industry sustainability. 
Speciﬁcally, we found that:
The Woody Biomass Utilization Grant program 
increased individual enterprises’ capacities 
to process biomass from national forests and 
diversify product lines
In both case study areas, the majority of the grants 
were for processing equipment, which substantially 
enhanced grantees’ capacities to diversify supply 
and product lines. Some enterprises were able to 
access biomass from national forestlands for the ﬁrst 
time; others improved their ability to use smaller-
diameter logs for value-added products, increasing 
the amount and types of forest biomass supply they 
could use. Many grantees diversiﬁed the types of 
products that they made and were better able to

weather the recession of 2008–10 by shifting toward 
products that were less dependent on the housing 
industry. 
The Woody Biomass Utilization Grant program 
substantially contributed to overall biomass 
industry capacity
The Woody Biomass Utilization Grant program pro-
vided grants for many different activities related to 
biomass utilization including providing technical 
assistance, purchasing additional harvesting equip-
ment, upgrading existing wood product processing 
facilities, and building new small-diameter saw-
mills. This broad scope meant that it was simulta-
neously investing in multiple places in the biomass 
supply chain in both case study areas. The program 
sustained and accelerated the biomass industry 
across eastern Oregon by adding numerous pieces 
of new harvesting and processing equipment to its 
capacity. In eastern Arizona, the program was the 
primary source of investment in the redevelopment 
of the entire forest products industry’s capacity to 
treat the land. In both cases, the program added and 
expanded multiple processing businesses, increas-
ing capacity to produce diverse value-added materi-
als near national forestland. 
In-state economic impacts arose from equipment 
purchases and use of matching funds for labor 
and services
An average of 70 percent of grants in both study 
areas went to equipment purchases and installation. 
Oregon grantees purchased some of their equip-
ment from Oregon vendors, while Arizona grant-
ees purchased no equipment in state, because few 
equipment vendors were available in Arizona. Yet 
economic impacts generated per 10,000 green tons 
were actually larger in eastern Arizona than in east-
ern Oregon, suggesting that biomass utilization is 
more labor intensive in Arizona and more mechani-
cally intensive in Oregon. In both cases, grantees 
spent matching funds on labor and services within 
the case study areas, which created important local 
economic activity. 
Intermediary assistance was key to program delivery
In both case studies, intermediaries including non-
proﬁt organizations, Forest Service personnel, state 
agency personnel, and others provided technical as-
sistance to grantees that improved overall program 
delivery. They identiﬁed prospective grantees with 
strong business models and opportunities to inno-
vate, offered grant writing assistance, and contrib-
uted signiﬁcant technical, ﬁnancial, and networking

skills in grant implementation. Without these inter-
mediaries, many grantees would likely have faced 
greater challenges and less success. In addition, the 
presence of collaborative groups and community-
based organizations that had worked on social agree-
ment and agency capacity issues prior to the grants 
helped make biomass supply available.  
Program impacts on public lands management 
were not clear
Grantees in both cases faced difficulty obtaining 
consistent biomass supply from national forests and 
grant impacts on acres treated and costs were not 
clear. National forest management often did not ap-
pear to be coordinated with or accelerated on behalf 
of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant program. In 
eastern Arizona, grantees operated on one national 
forest with a large stewardship contract for service 
work and biomass removal that a single contractor 
held, which grantees felt limited their access to raw 
material. In eastern Oregon, grantees operated across 
six national forests that did not share any particular 
strategy or commitment to biomass utilization; but 
the forests used more diverse, ﬂexible mechanisms 
for biomass access. In addition to business capacity, 
the ability of national forest and Regional Ofﬁce staff 
to plan and implement land management projects 
with biomass utilization components is important 
for treating acres and reducing costs. However, a 
monitoring report on the White Mountain Steward-
ship Project suggests that the effects of increased bio-
mass utilization capacity on the Apache-Sitgreaves 
National Forest were notable because costs per acre 
remained stable during an unprecedented downturn 
in the wood products markets; and, further, because 
costs did not increase even though contractors began 
to treat more complex areas.
Challenges to program success included market 
conditions and grantee capacity
Grantees in both cases faced signiﬁcant technical 
and market challenges, including new and little-
understood biomass utilization applications and 
a depressed housing market and recession. Some 
grantees did not add enough value to their products, 
create a specialty product niche, have strong under-
standing of and access to the right markets, or select 
the most efﬁcient and effective use for small-diam-
eter pine. In eastern Oregon, grantees that sought to 
enter markets that were well beyond their control 
and relatively weak during the study period, such 
as the electricity market, were severely challenged 
and could not complete their grants. 
The Woody Biomass Utilization Grant program 
provided unique investment that does not seem to 
be available through other programs and policies
The Woody Biomass Utilization Grant program was 
unique in that it allowed a land management agency 
to fund equipment acquisition, ﬁll gaps in regional 
industry, and support networks of technical assis-
tance and learning. Grantees in both cases expressed 
disappointment that the Woody Biomass Utilization 
Grant program shifted its focus (after 2010) to fund-
ing engineering studies for energy projects, noting 
that 1) there was less interest in this type of assis-
tance in their regions, and 2) other grant programs 
did not ﬁt their need to increase capacity to utilize 
biomass from public lands. 
Lessons 
Careful grantee review and intermediary 
engagement improved grant success
Intermediary assistance both before and during 
grants may increase enterprise capacity and the 
likelihood of grant success. A robust review panel 
including external participants with diverse exper-
tise (e.g. technical, ﬁnancial, etc.) could be useful for 
examining grant proposals for equipment viability, 
grantee experience, legal authority/licensing issues, 
and sustainable business plans. During the grants, 
deliberate investment in technical assistance to 
help grantees understand equipment, technology, 
and markets in particular may help increase the vi-
ability of grants.

Coordination and engagement with National 
Forest System managers are as important as 
business investment
The Woody Biomass Utilization Grant program di-
rectly built enterprise capacity, but not agency ca-
pacity for biomass utilization. The ability of national 
forest and Regional Ofﬁce staff to plan and imple-
ment land management is essential to increasing 
acres treated and reducing costs. Deliberate, coordi-
nated investment in agency capacity at local levels, 
particularly on how to use stewardship contracting 
and how to build working relationships with local 
businesses to understand their abilities and needs, 
might help improve land management outcomes. 
Lack of monitoring limited measurement of 
impacts
Requesting information and measures that grantees 
will readily know and that are focused on the busi-
ness outcomes may increase reporting and under-
standing of impacts. Further, more close contact and 
guidance on measurement between the Forest Prod-
ucts Laboratory, the Regional Ofﬁces, and national 
forest units may help improve the availability and 
accuracy of data on broad interest measures such as 
acres treated and costs.

F
orestland restoration and hazardous fu-
els reduction are critical land management 
objectives of the USDA Forest Service. Re-
moving and utilizing woody biomass1 and creat-
ing value-added products from these activities can 
help defray land management costs, enhance com-
munity wildﬁre protection, and provide business 
and economic opportunities in rural public lands 
communities.2 However, harvesting and removing 
biomass from the forest is expensive, and there are 
challenges to starting woody biomass enterprises 
or adding biomass utilization to existing business 
models. These include limited access to capital and 
markets, technical assistance, and supply from pub-
lic lands.3 Where woody biomass is already being 
utilized, it often is a combination of private land 
and mill residuals, rather than byproducts of res-
toration and fuels reduction on national forests.4
To help meet forest restoration goals across all land-
scapes, the Forest Service articulated a strategy for 
addressing enterprise and technical obstacles and 
increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of fu-
els reduction through woody biomass utilization. 
This included funding for the Woody Biomass Uti-
lization Grant program, administered by the State 
and Private Forestry’s Technology Marketing Unit 
located at the Forest Products Laboratory (FPL).5
Founded in 2005, program objectives aimed to 1) 
reduce market barriers to biomass utilization, 2) de-
crease costs of forest restoration by increasing value-
added production from biomass, and 3) encourage 
enterprise development.6 From its inception until 
2011, the program provided grants for equipment 
acquisition and technical assistance for an array of 
biomass uses. Since 2011, it has shifted to grants for 
engineering studies for bioenergy facilities. 
The Woody Biomass Utilization Grant program was 
unique in that it provided investment opportunities 
for the woody biomass industry, and achieved USDA 
Forest Service fuels reduction and land restoration 
objectives through economic and industrial devel-
opment. Direct investment in biomass enterprises 
has not been the primary intent of many granting 
programs or policies. 
Although other federal grant sources such as USDA 
Rural Development’s Business and Cooperative pro-
gram do exist, it is not clear if restoration and for-
est products businesses are successfully accessing 
them. A study of this Rural Development program in 
Oregon found that less than one percent of all funds 
from 2007–11 (about $230,000 in total) went to these 
types of businesses.7 Policies such as the National 
Fire Plan of 2001 also provided resources for an ar-

6      The Impacts of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant Program in Eastern Oregon and Eastern Arizona
ray of hazardous fuels reduction-related activities, 
but these policies also were not speciﬁcally directed 
at biomass enterprises. 
To examine the impacts of this unique program, the 
FPL asked the Ecosystem Workforce Program at the 
University of Oregon and Northern Arizona Uni-
versity to conduct case studies of Woody Biomass 
Utilization grants awarded in eastern Oregon and 
eastern Arizona. Both regions have signiﬁcant for-
est restoration and wildﬁre protection needs, high 
percentages of public land, and active collaborative 
efforts around land management and business devel-
opment. In particular, the FPL wished to understand 
how the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant program 
had affected enterprise capacity, improved cost-
per-acre and biomass utilization opportunities on 
public land, and generated jobs and other economic 
impacts. 
We ﬁrst separately present results from the eastern 
Oregon and eastern Arizona case studies on the fol-
lowing topics: enterprise impacts, industry capacity 
impacts, intermediary roles, Forest Service dimen-
sions, and policy dimensions. We then comparative-
ly discuss lessons learned, including insights into 
successful grants, and other cross-case observations.
Methods
We studied grants awarded between 2005 and 2010 
in eastern Oregon and the White Mountains region 
of eastern Arizona. We employed mixed methods 
including document analysis, semi-structured inter-
views, and economic impact analysis and modeling.
Qualitative analysis
The Woody Biomass Utilization Grant program 
provided documentation including grant proposals 
with requested and matching budget information, 
progress and ﬁnal reports, and some biomass uti-
lization data from national forests. However, grant 
records were incomplete as grantees and national 
forest personnel were not consistent in returning 
or entirely completing reports. We reviewed these 
documents and entered available data about grant 
amount, duration, use, beneﬁts and outcomes, chal-
lenges, and other dimensions into a standardized 
proﬁle for each grantee, and identiﬁed information 
gaps to pursue through interviews. 
We conducted interviews between February and 
May 2013. In Oregon, one researcher conducted 
interviews with ten grant recipients, and ﬁve key 
informants from the Forest Service’s Region 6 Of-
ﬁce, national forests, and the Oregon Department of 
Forestry. Interviews were not conducted with four 
grant recipients who were not available. Our analy-
sis excluded one of the harvesting grants as no data 
were available. Although two bioenergy grants did 
not result in successful facilities, we discuss them 
brieﬂy to the extent that information was available. 
One researcher from northern Arizona conducted in-
terviews; ten with grantees, two with Forest Service 
personnel, and one with a regional stakeholder who 
provided assistance to grantees. Interviews were not 
conducted with two of the grantees; one was un-
successful and transferred the equipment to another 
company and the other became ill. Interviews were 
conducted primarily in person. We used the proﬁles 
for each grantee to guide our interview questions. 
In the Oregon case, we took structured, detailed 
notes during the interviews, and added further 
ﬁeld notes afterward to capture additional impres-
sions and themes. In the Arizona case, interviews 
were audio-recorded and transcribed. We organized 
interview data into matrices to develop, compare, 
and contrast findings within and across the case 
studies in the following categories, which mirrored 
interview questions: use of grant; enterprise and in-
dustry context; new enterprise developments and 
opportunities due to the grant; effects on industry 
and markets; role of the Forest Service, challenges 
and limitations; and comments on regional biomass 
utilization successes and challenges. The research 
team used the matrices to discuss interview ﬁndings 
and integrate them with results from IMPLAN and 
other data sources.
Economic impact analysis
We used the economic impact modeling software 
IMPLAN 3.08 to describe impacts of the Woody Bio-
mass Utilization Grant program on the economies of 
Oregon and Arizona (see Appendix A, page 34). We 
analyzed impacts from: 1) purchases of goods and 

The Impacts of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant Program in Eastern Oregon and Eastern Arizona      7
services, and 2) utilization of biomass from opera-
tion of new equipment as reported by grantees. 
Economic impacts for both the grant awards and 
subsequent biomass utilization are reported as a 
total and annual average for the study period and 
annually (for grants from 2005 to 2010, and for utili-
zation from 2006 to 2011). We estimated the impacts 
of grant purchases by developing an expenditure 
proﬁle for both grant expenditures along with re-
ported matching funds. Since one measure of grant 
effectiveness is whether a grant triggers a project 
that requires spending of some non-grant dollars 
that would not otherwise occur, match impacts are 
important to analyze. We estimated biomass utiliza-
tion impacts using an existing IMPLAN model of 
biomass utilization that the University of Oregon 
had previously developed to estimate the impact 
of the Oregon Biomass Producers or Consumers 
Tax Credit.9 We adapted this model for the Arizona 
economy. The utilization model focuses on collec-
tion of forest biomass and its delivery to a biomass 
utilization facility, based on the volume of material 
harvested. The model, however, does not estimate 
the impact of the sale of ﬁnished goods produced 
from forest biomass (e.g. electricity, heat, posts and 
poles, animal bedding, etc.) in the marketplace. 
Rather, IMPLAN measured how demand for biomass 
processing equipment and other goods and services 
required for the collection and transport of forest 
biomass traced through the economies of Arizona 
and Oregon to create broader changes in employ-
ment, wages, economic output, and taxes. 
We did not estimate jobs or economic activity gener-
ated through the production and sales of end-con-
sumer ﬁnished goods (e.g. energy, small-diameter 
posts and poles), nor did we estimate quantity or 
value of these ﬁnished goods in our economic im-
pact analysis. Adding these jobs and economic ac-
tivity to the analysis would likely substantially add 
to the economic impact we estimated. For example, 
if we assumed that wages paid to employees of the 
grantees were paid not for equipment set up but to 
operate the purchased equipment in the production 
of ﬁnished goods, we would report more than 100 
jobs produced per year in each state from the pro-
duction and sale of ﬁnished goods alone. As such, 
our estimates represent conservative estimates that 
are in line with previous studies of the economic 
impacts of forest and watershed restoration.10,11
Eastern Oregon case study
Case study area
Eastern Oregon is an informally-deﬁned region that 
we considered as the 18 counties east of the Cascade 
Mountain Range. Its diversity of ecosystems includes 
the Blue Mountains and foothills, Eastern Cascade 
Mountains, Northwestern Basin and Range, and 
smaller portions of the Modoc Plateau and Southern 
Cascade Mountains. Forest types range from moist 
mixed-conifer to sage-steppe shrublands.12 Histori-
cally, wildﬁre was a frequent occurrence in much 
of this landscape. 
Eastern Oregon is a rural region with 22 percent of 
the state’s 3.8 million people, and only one county 
(Deschutes) that is a census-designated metro area. 
The majority of the communities are small with lim-
ited transportation and market connections to ur-
ban areas, although the city of Bend has over 90,000 
residents. Within the greater eastern Oregon study 
area, we focused on three subregions: northeastern 
Oregon, the Blue Mountains, and central Oregon. 
A recent study of forest products processing capac-
ity in eastern Oregon suggests that there were 45 
operational primary processing facilities at the end 
of 2012, deﬁned as “manufacturers who produce 
wood products directly from logs, such as lumber, 
veneer, plywood, posts and poles, timbers, clean 
chips, hog fuel, and shavings; manufacturers who 
make products from bark, sawdust, and planer shav-
ings, such as pulp and paper mills, composite panel 
plants, mulch and soil amendment producers, densi-
ﬁed wood fuel plants, animal bedding plants, and 
thermal and electrical energy facilities.”13 This is 
a more extensive and diverse capacity than that of 
eastern Arizona. However, eastern Oregon’s indus-
try has also contracted signiﬁcantly in the past two 
decades; 30 sawmills and nine other facilities have 
closed since 1990.14

Forest management context
Eastern Oregon contains the Wallowa-Whitman, 
Malheur, Umatilla, Ochoco, Deschutes, and Fre-
mont-Winema National Forests, as well as exten-
sive Bureau of Land Management ownership that 
together constitute 84 percent of Oregon’s federal 
lands.15 The region is home to at least ten established 
forest collaborative groups and several community-
based organizations that support biomass utilization 
efforts on federal lands. Collaborative groups in Ore-
gon are organized around national forests or speciﬁc 
landscapes and include diverse interests that work 
together to identify shared goals on public lands and 
play varying roles in the development, implementa-
tion, and monitoring of land management projects. 
At the start of the study period (2005), collaborative 
efforts included the Central Oregon Partnerships for 
Wildﬁre Risk Reduction (COPWRR), the Lakeview 
Stewardship Group, the Wallowa County Natural 
Resources Action Committee, and the Blue Moun-
tains Forest Partners. By the end of the study pe-
riod, collaborative groups had formed or were about 
to form on every national forest in eastern Oregon. 
Community-based organizations are small nonprof-
it entities that support integrated natural resource

cal areas. They perform diverse tasks such as stafﬁng 
collaborative groups, providing technical assistance 
to enterprises and land management agencies, or or-
ganizing community wildﬁre protection planning. 
Collaboratives and community-based organizations 
often support biomass utilization on national forests 
by seeking the social agreement and agency capacity 
necessary to design and implement projects wherein 
biomass supply will be produced from the forest, 
recruiting entrepreneurs, assisting enterprises with 
obtaining grants and other resources, or exploring 
market development. In the study period, there were 
two active community-based organizations in the re-
gion: Wallowa Resources, founded in 1996 in north-
eastern Oregon, and the Lake County Resources Ini-
tiative, founded in 2002 in southern-central Oregon. 
Regional-scale intermediaries, such as Sustainable 
Northwest, Oregon Solutions, and The Nature Con-
servancy have also been active in providing techni-
cal support and resources to encourage active for-
est restoration and increase biomass utilization and 
economic activity in eastern Oregon.
Case study ﬁndings
Overview of grants
The Woody Biomass Utilization Grant program sup-
ported 14 recipients in eastern Oregon during our 
study period: 11 enterprises, two nonproﬁts, and 
one regional government entity (see Table 2, page 
9, and Figure 1, page 11). Three grants were for har-
vesting equipment, seven grants were for processing 
capacity, two were for bioenergy facility develop-
ment, and two were for technical assistance and 
other intermediary activities. Recipients included 
logging contractors, existing enterprises that were 
already utilizing biomass for small-diameter wood 
products, ﬁrms proposing bioenergy facilities, a re-
gional council of governments, a regional nonproﬁt 
organization, and a community-based organization. 
All recipients performed biomass utilization or re-
lated work on both national forestland and private 
land in eastern Oregon. 
Grants in eastern Oregon totaled $3.2 million in the 
study period, and were matched with an additional 
$3.4 million of funding from other sources (mostly 
private sector) (see Table 3, page 10, and Figure 2, 

The Impacts of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant Program in Eastern Oregon and Eastern Arizona      9
page 12). Grantees used more than 63 percent of 
grant dollars and more than 48 percent of total 
Woody Biomass Utilization Grant project spending 
in eastern Oregon to purchase equipment (see Table 
4, page 10). They purchased the majority of equip-
ment in Oregon. Marketing and consulting services 
were the second largest grant expenditure category, 
followed by wages paid to employees of grantees. 
Grantees spent matching funds in somewhat differ-
ent proportions than grant dollars. Although equip-
ment purchases and wages remained the top two 
categories of spending, relatively less of the match-
ing funds were spent on equipment and relatively 
more was spent on wages. Furthermore, installa-
tion costs (25 percent), related to the installation 
and construction of utilization facilities, were the 
third largest category of match spending. Another 
difference between grant and match spending was 
that a substantially greater proportion of grant funds 
went to marketing and technical consulting services.

12      The Impacts of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant Program in Eastern Oregon and Eastern Arizona
Grant impacts at the enterprise scale
We examined program impacts on individual en-
terprises, which included: creating jobs and other 
economic impacts; and improving their ability to ac-
cess supply, diversify product lines, obtain capital, 
and use matching resources. 
Grant and match purchases impacts
Woody Biomass Utilization Grant spending between 
2005 and 2010 in eastern Oregon generated one-time 
impacts of over 51 jobs (about nine jobs per year 
for six years), $3.9 million in wages ($0.7 million 
per year), $6.1 million in economic activities ($1.0 
million per year), and $1.1 million in tax revenues 
($0.2 million per year) (see Table 5, page 13). Match-
ing funds, which were mostly spent on labor and 
services, generated 36 percent more jobs, 73 per-
cent more wages and beneﬁts, and 41 percent more 
economic output than grant funds. Grant spending 
generated less economic impact per dollar because 
it was focused on equipment purchases, roughly 
a third of which were outside of Oregon, and the 
remainder of which occurred through wholesalers 
(which add relatively little economic value over and 
above the cost of the equipment). The potential for 
ongoing impacts of the Woody Biomass Utilization 
Grant program is addressed next.

Increased capacity to harvest and remove biomass 
Two of the studied enterprises were contractors 
who invested in harvesting equipment to more efﬁ-
ciently remove biomass from the forest. Traditional 
logging contractors can perform some biomass har-
vesting and removal, but these tasks often require 
different equipment to selectively cut and handle 
small-diameter material (“slash” such as brush, tree 
tops and branches; or very small logs). One grantee, 
an established biomass removal business that har-
vested, ground, and transported biomass to pow-
er plants, acquired a new grapple that efﬁciently 
grabbed more slash at once. The grantee was able 
to remove an average of 30 loads a day using this 
equipment, which increased the scope and scale of 
their work on the Deschutes National Forest. An-
other grantee, a logging and ﬁreﬁghting contractor, 
purchased a horizontal grinder and several other 
pieces of equipment to add biomass chipping to 
their existing capacity. Chipping broke the biomass 
into smaller pieces, enabling transport of more ma-
terial at less cost. This grantee reported removing 
an estimated 2,100 green tons of biomass from 670 
acres on the Winema National Forest, but utilized 
their equipment far more on California national for-
ests and private timberland. 
Diversiﬁcation of supply and product lines
In line with the goals of the Woody Biomass Uti-
lization Grant program, ten enterprises purchased 
equipment that allowed them to add value to for-
est biomass and diversify both their supply and 
product lines. All enterprises interviewed stated 
that without the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant 
program, they would not have been able to initiate 
or expand biomass utilization. 
Although there are numerous factors in successful 
supply diversiﬁcation, such as the ability of nation-
al forest units to offer biomass material, enterprise 
capacity and equipment type also mattered. We 
found that one grantee, an animal bedding busi-
ness, was able to access in-woods biomass supply 
for the ﬁrst time. By acquiring a new log shaver, the 
grantee was able to transition from utilizing only 
sawmill residuals from a Weyerhaeuser facility in 
western Washington to obtaining pine shavings 
from forest management activities on the Deschutes

14      The Impacts of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant Program in Eastern Oregon and Eastern Arizona
and Ochoco National Forests. This meant that they 
were less vulnerable to ﬂuctuations in supply from 
Weyerhaeuser, which is affected directly by housing 
markets and other external factors, and had access 
to more local material. 
We also found that the grants allowed enterprises to 
create new kinds of products. One grantee’s new log 
peeler allowed the ﬁrm to process larger and longer 
logs, reach new value-added post and pole markets 
such as hops poles, and double their production off 
both Forest Service and private lands. A sawmill 
grantee was able to substantially diversify its business 
by shaving small-diameter logs for a new market; the 
mill previously did not have equipment to process 
this type of material. This allowed the grantee to sell 
lighter, ﬂufﬁer pine shavings, which are in demand 
in the bagged animal bedding industry, and contrib-
uted to their further expansion in 2009 to add a pellet 
mill. Two integrated biomass production facilities 
also restructured their systems and merchandizing to 
add greater value to forest biomass products. 
Enterprise capacity to obtain capital and 
leverage match
Forest Service employees and others familiar with 
the grants noted that Woody Biomass Utilization 
Grant funding provided enterprises with the oppor-
tunity to obtain other resources and combine them 
with the grant to maximize impact. Obtaining capital 
is often challenging for small natural resource-based 
businesses, but grantees were able to use their grant 
applications to leverage additional access to capital 
that would not otherwise have been possible. For 
example, with its grant to start a small-diameter post 
and pole facility, a community-based organization 
was able to secure a line of credit from Northeast 
Oregon Economic Development District and develop 
a limited liability corporation business model. In 
total, the grant allowed the organization to acquire 
$320,000 in additional investments to continue de-
velopment of multiple components of a biomass uti-
lization campus model; today, this is a successful 
enterprise that has continued to expand its capacity. 
Further, nearly all studied grantees used signiﬁcant 
matching dollars to complete work associated with 
their grants, such as covering staff time or construct-
ing buildings to house new equipment.  
Grant impacts and issues at the regional/
industry scale
We examined the impacts of these grants on overall 
industry capacity and biomass markets. We consid-
ered industry capacity to include the strength, diver-
sity, and distribution of harvesting and processing 
enterprises, bioenergy facilities, and intermediaries.
Overall industry capacity
The studied grants helped add numerous pieces of 
new harvesting and processing equipment to the 
biomass industry in eastern Oregon. We consider 
how these grants affected dimensions of overall in-
dustry capacity, and then capacity in each of the 
studied sub-regions. 
We found that the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant 
program invested the most (in both dollar amounts 
and numbers of grants) in processing capacity in 
eastern Oregon. The seven grants to processing en-
terprises were distributed across the study region, 
and had different effects depending on location as 
we discuss below by subregion. They added or ex-
panded production of animal bedding, shavings, 
posts and poles, and ﬁrewood.
The second-largest amount was spent on grants to 
intermediaries. The three grants and one sub-grant 
to nonproﬁt and governmental organizations greatly 
helped increase the abilities of staff to understand 
biomass business needs and provide technical assis-
tance. They also supported the overall strength and 
resiliency of these organizations by contributing to 
their budgets and helping to build successful grant 
writing records. Moreover, these entities already had 
working relationships, and with a common source 
of support, they were able to grow their collective 
focus on regional industry growth and build shared 
knowledge about biomass utilization.
Three grants for harvesting equipment went to grant-
ees primarily active on the Deschutes and Fremont-
Winema National Forests in central and southern-
central Oregon. Investment in harvesting capacity 
was thus fairly concentrated in one sub-region. It 
is not clear if there was already adequate harvest-
ing capacity in other sub-regions and businesses 
from those areas did not apply for grants, or if they 

The Impacts of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant Program in Eastern Oregon and Eastern Arizona      15
did and were not competitive. Two of these grant-
ees continue to operate in the sub-region, but one 
grantee that had purchased a horizontal grinder and 
numerous other pieces of equipment relocated the 
business out of the state toward the end of the grant 
period, taking its new capacity outside Oregon. 
Despite extensive interest in building biomass co-
generation and electricity facilities in eastern Or-
egon, the two grants for bioenergy projects did not 
lead to increased capacity. One grant was repur-
posed for investments in a sawmill, while the other 
for a planned 26.8-megawatt plant in Lakeview has 
not resulted in a new facility being built. Harvest-
ing grantees ground biomass and transported it to 
plants in southern Oregon and northern California, 
outside of the study area. There continues to be no 
active capacity for larger-scale biomass electricity 
use in eastern Oregon.
Northeastern Oregon
Although a sawmill and several other forest products 
facilities exist in Union County, Wallowa County has 
no processing infrastructure and there have been 
longstanding efforts since the closure of its remain-
ing sawmills to institute an integrated biomass uti-
lization campus. The two grants awarded in north-
eastern Oregon for an emerging integrated biomass 
utilization campus business contributed signiﬁcantly 
to the redevelopment of processing capacity in north-
eastern Oregon. Another grant to a regional nonproﬁt 
for technical assistance included a sub-grant for mov-
ing biomass utilization ideas forward with a land-
owner cooperative in Baker County (see Intermediary 
roles and impacts, page 16). This sub-grant helped 
increase knowledge and understanding of the chal-
lenges of biomass utilization among members of this 
cooperative, but has not resulted in the development 
of any new biomass infrastructure in the area to date. 
Blue Mountains
The two grants awarded in this area expanded the 
capacity of the existing lumber industry to process 
small-diameter logs for new uses. The ability of 
one sawmill grantee to use small-diameter logs for 
bagged shavings created an end use for this material 
off the Malheur National Forest where there pre-
viously had been none. Another grant improved a 
small-log sort and merchandizing yard project of an 
enterprise based in Pendleton, enhancing the ﬁrm’s 
ability to process small-diameter material from sev-
eral national forests in Oregon and Washington.
Central Oregon
Central Oregon’s industry capacity at the time of the 
grant program was diverse and included two saw-
mills and several value-added and other biomass 
enterprises. Seven grants went to entities for bio-
mass utilization in national forests in the central 
Oregon area for an array of activities that included 
harvesting, processing, bioenergy development, and 
technical assistance. All the grants for harvesting 
equipment were focused on this sub-region although 
one of the grantees relocated the business after the 
grant. Investments in processing were for the diverse 
purposes of ﬁrewood, animal bedding, and post and 
pole equipment. Sub-regional capacity to produce 
ﬁrewood and post and poles from activities on na-
tional forest lands was enhanced and new capacity 
to produce animal bedding from these activities was 
created, adding a new end user for forest biomass to 
the industry. As a result of intermediary investments 
in technical assistance and relationship building, 
the proﬁle of biomass utilization and its role in re-
storing federal lands in central Oregon has grown. 
One downstream effect has been the successful 
installation of a biomass boiler for heat at an area 
school. Although the demand for biomass is small 
with such thermal projects, this was an innovative 
development. In sum, the Woody Biomass Utiliza-
tion Grant program invested in multiple facets of 
the biomass utilization industry in this sub-region. 
Market effects and challenges
Market conditions for housing and broader econom-
ic trends affect forest products businesses. Biomass 
processing enterprises are closely linked to other 
kinds of forest products facilities such as sawmills, 
where they often obtain residuals, and to logging 
and restoration contractors who remove material 
from the woods. Demand for forest products was 
low during the study period due to poor housing 
markets. As a result, several projects wherein grant-
ees planned to remove biomass from public lands 
did not occur, and biomass material was left piled at 
landings. Reduced energy demand and low natural 

16      The Impacts of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant Program in Eastern Oregon and Eastern Arizona
gas prices meant that there was less need for biomass 
electricity from existing plants and less impetus to 
build new plants. Further, low chip prices made it 
difﬁcult for biomass end users and businesses to 
compete for this ﬁber. These diverse market drivers 
affected biomass utilization in eastern Oregon in the 
study period, yet were largely beyond the control of 
grantees. Several interviewees suggested that grants 
were more successful when the recipients were op-
erating in smaller markets in which there may have 
been less variability, such as animal bedding, and 
more ability to work directly with customers and 
understand their preferences.
Several interviewees also remarked that the woody 
biomass industry in eastern Oregon faced challeng-
es because no entities were working speciﬁcally on 
helping to grow markets (e.g. trade associations, 
nonprofit partners). They suggested that despite 
the supportive work of intermediaries to help en-
terprises understand new markets or expand their 
markets, there has been no sustained investment in 
this aspect of biomass utilization.
Intermediary roles and impacts
Grants for intermediary organizations and functions 
were an important component of Woody Biomass 
Utilization Grant program investments in eastern 
Oregon. We examined both the direct grants to in-
termediaries as well as the roles that other interme-
diaries such as the Forest Service Regional Ofﬁce 
played in program delivery.    
Direct investment in intermediaries
The Woody Biomass Utilization Grant program 
provided grants to two regional intermediaries to 
work on technical assistance and marketing issues. 
A regional council of governments in central Oregon 
used their Woody Biomass Utilization Grant resourc-
es to partner with the National Forest System to ad-
dress public lands supply, a crucial barrier as inves-
tors can be unwilling to support enterprises with 
uncertain future material supply. They researched 
and built a Coordinated Resource Offering Protocol 
(“CROP”) database to track available volumes of bio-
mass and coordinate supply offering across the cen-
tral Oregon region. The council of governments was 
able to provide this information to several potential 
investors in bioenergy and small-diameter wood 
products to help them further plans to locate new 
facilities in the region. For several years, this helped 
keep conversations about and interest in biomass 
utilization alive in the region. However, there have 
been several challenges and the database is currently 
not as frequently used. National forest units in cen-
tral Oregon are supposed to submit data on planned 
biomass projects and predicted amounts annually, 
but reporting is inconsistent.
A regional nonproﬁt organization also received a 
grant to act as an intermediary that 1) served as a 
pass-through for several sub-grantees and 2) provid-
ed technical assistance to grantees and any others 
working on biomass utilization in eastern Oregon. 
This regional NGO administered sub-grants on be-
half of several entities that did not have the capacity 
or scale of proposed projects alone to be competitive. 
The NGO made four sub-grants, two of which were 
in eastern Oregon. One was to the council of govern-
ments described above to provide direct technical 
assistance to central Oregon businesses interested in 
biomass utilization. With this support, the council 
of governments helped a secondary manufacturing 
business in Prineville install a new wood-ﬁred dry-
er system, and led several explorations of potential 
thermal biomass use in facilities such as schools and 
recreational buildings. The other sub-grantee was a 
landowner cooperative in northeastern Oregon that 
had longstanding interest in creating local infrastruc-
ture to aggregate and process biomass from private 
nonindustrial forestland. This sub-grant helped 
this entity and the regional nonproﬁt work togeth-
er through a series of meetings to better articulate 
their interests and explore possible facility designs 
with an engineering study. With the remainder of its 
funds, this regional nonproﬁt undertook other inter-
mediary activities that included hosting a regional 
workshop on thermal energy opportunities. 
In addition, a nonproﬁt in Wallowa County received 
a grant to initiate an integrated biomass business in 
2005. After several years, this business itself applied 
for and received a second grant. However, at the 
time of the ﬁrst grant, there was no existing business 
entity able or willing to apply to the Woody Biomass 
Utilization Grant program and take on the risk of 

The Impacts of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant Program in Eastern Oregon and Eastern Arizona      17
starting this enterprise. The nonproﬁt acted as an 
intermediary that obtained and held the grant, orga-
nized a for-proﬁt subsidiary of their organization as 
a limited liability corporation, and took on signiﬁ-
cant risk and uncertainty in order to move toward 
building small-diameter processing infrastructure 
in the county.
Intermediary roles in program delivery
These funded intermediaries, as well as staff from 
the Forest Service’s Region 6 Ofﬁce and biomass 
specialists from Oregon’s state forestry and energy 
agencies, were also important in providing technical 
assistance to grantees and improving overall pro-
gram delivery. They ﬁrst helped identify prospec-
tive grantees with strong business models and op-
portunities for innovating, and encouraged them to 
weigh costs and beneﬁts and apply if appropriate. 
This higher-level view of the biomass industry was 
essential; the intermediaries built an understand-
ing of what capacities existed, and what pieces of 
equipment and types of enterprises might ﬁll gaps 
in different places across eastern Oregon, and stra-
tegically recruited grantees according to this vision. 
Intermediaries also supported grantees that lacked 
experience in grant writing, particularly in making 
the case for investment, identifying market gaps, 
and articulating how they would ﬁll them for their 
proposals. This helped ensure not only that grant-
ees had strong applications, but also that they were 
more prepared to successfully implement grants if 
they did receive them because they had the opportu-
nity to think through possible issues, build relation-
ships, and learn more about biomass utilization. In 
addition, many grantees encountered unexpected 
issues during implementation and needed to alter 
plans or otherwise adapt. Intermediaries also as-
sisted with these issues by, for example, strategizing 
with grantees and each other, or researching pos-
sible alternative technologies and equipment.
National Forest System dimensions
We explored the effects of grants on number of 
green tons removed and utilized, acres treated, and 
reduction of treatment costs, as well as the role that 
national forest units played in making biomass ac-
cessible to grantees.
Providing access to biomass
National forests in eastern Oregon made biomass 
available through two different competitive mecha-
nisms: stewardship contracts for forest restoration 
service work that included biomass removal, and 
timber sales to remove goods. Stewardship contracts 
allow the Forest Service to combine multiple tasks 
in a single contract and can include the exchange 
of goods for services. We found that grantees in all 
three sub-regions described challenges in obtaining 
biomass supply from national forests. Numerous in-
terviewees suggested that the Forest Service’s ability 
to plan and administer for biomass utilization was 
nascent, limited, and inconsistent. One repeated ob-
servation was that the slow rate of the environmental 
planning process meant few hazardous fuels reduc-
tion projects were ready to implement by the time 
grantees installed equipment. At least two grantees 
utilized their new equipment far more frequently on 
private industrial lands and hardly at all on national 
forest lands. However, the grantee near the Malheur 
National Forest, who purchased biomass as part of 
timber sales, worked with the national forest staff to 
help them understand their business needs and did 
not report the same challenges.  
National forest interviewees emphasized that For-
est Service personnel often lacked experience with 
stewardship contracting, and that it was used incon-
sistently across the study region. One national forest 
interviewee did explain that beginning to admin-
ister for biomass was a positive capacity-building 
experience for contracting and personnel because it 
allowed them to learn new skills and tools, as well 
as improve their understanding of and relationships 
with regional contractors and biomass enterprises. 
For the Deschutes National Forest, an increase in the 
use of stewardship contracting, particularly on the 
Sisters Ranger District, occurred during the study 
period and expanded that forest’s ability to use more 
diverse and ﬂexible tools to implement hazardous 
fuels reduction projects. In particular, personnel 
from this forest learned to offer contracts and sales 
of a variety of sizes that could be accessible to the 
different businesses operating in their area. On the 
Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, the nonproﬁt 
that was building a new biomass enterprise was able 
to initiate discussions with agency staff about how 

18      The Impacts of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant Program in Eastern Oregon and Eastern Arizona
to better plan and structure future work to include 
cost-effective biomass removal. 
Impacts on hazardous fuels reduction and costs
The Forest Products Laboratory asked local na-
tional forest personnel and grantees to report on 
acres treated and costs per acre. Grant reporting for 
eastern Oregon, however, was inconsistent. Eight of 
the studied grantees reported national forest acres 
treated, while two others reported only private acres 
and one reported tribal acres. Grantee and Forest 
Service personnel interviews revealed that biomass 
availability through stewardship contracts and tim-
ber sales varied between national forests. Forest Ser-
vice interviewees from the Deschutes and Malheur 
National Forests noted understanding the biomass 
suppy demand of local enterprises spurred them to 
plan projects accordingly. 
However, it was not fully possible to attribute a pre-
cise number of acres treated to the grants. Grantees 
and Forest Service interviewees indicated that the 
ways in which the Forest Service tracks and reports 
acres treated made it difﬁcult to evaluate grant ef-
fects on acres and costs. Further, many factors—not 
just the presence of biomass business capacity—af-
fect costs, such as location, terrain, or forest type. 
Mechanically removing biomass for utilization may 
be less expensive than hand piling and burning if an 
end user purchases it.16 On the Deschutes and Mal-
heur National Forests, Forest Service interviewees 
reported that piles were removed that would other-
wise have been burned, and indicated that avoided 
costs for piling and burning ranged from $125–$800/
acre depending on the speciﬁcs of the project. On 
the Malheur, agency staff described treatment costs 
of approximately $500 per acre for pre-commercial 
thinning prior to a local sawmill receiving a grant. 
Following implementation of the grant, many of the 
stewardship projects on the Malheur National Forest 
cost $300-$450 per acre, which interviewees attrib-
uted directly to the expansion of biomass capacity in 
the Blue Mountains area. However, without detailed 
analysis of Forest Service records for each contract 
and timber sale, it is not possible to provide cost/
acre outcomes for each grantee. 
Impacts on green ton removal
The Forest Products Laboratory also requested that 
grantees report green tons removed and utilized, but 
this was challenging for several of the processing 
grantees as they purchased biomass from contractors 
rather than harvesting it themselves, and were not 
certain of the total amounts of green tons being har-
vested. Grantees in eastern Oregon reported a total 
of 490,321 green tons of woody biomass harvested 
and utilized in the study period. Collection from 
these grantees increased in eastern Oregon from un-

The Impacts of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant Program in Eastern Oregon and Eastern Arizona      19
der 10,000 green tons in 2006 to over 170,000 green 
tons in 2011 (see Table 6, page 18). This large growth 
is likely due to errors or overlapping reporting by 
Oregon grantees in early years. Moreover, other fac-
tors such as markets and business decisions affect 
rates of harvest. However, it is likely that the growth 
of biomass utilization enterprises in the region as a 
result of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant pro-
gram did cause some increase in green ton utiliza-
tion as opposed to business as usual. The collection 
and delivery reported during the study period gener-
ated a total of 125 jobs and over $21 million in new 
economic activity in the state of Oregon, but again, 
these impacts likely appear larger due to reporting 
errors.  
Policy and program dimensions
We found that some grantees, especially the non-
business entities, viewed their Woody Biomass Uti-
lization Grant as a helpful investment that was part 
of a larger set of federal and state biomass policies 
and programs they were using to accomplish their 
goals. They indicated that it was a combination of 
policies and programs rather than any “silver bul-
let” that made biomass utilization on public lands 
possible in eastern Oregon. For example, these inter-
viewees described using National Fire Plan resourc-
es prior to the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant pro-
gram (2001–04) to support more active hazardous 
fuels reduction and community wildﬁre protection 
on their national forests, conduct research, develop 
their cases and proofs of concept, and make busi-
ness plans. The Woody Biomass Utilization Grant 
program was a “perfect” follow-up to the National 
Fire Plan grants because it allowed grantees that had 
laid this groundwork in previous years to then in-
vest in equipment. 
All grantee interviewees commented upon the shift 
in program focus from equipment to engineering/
study grants, expressing disappointment that there 
was no longer a Forest Service program that sup-
ported equipment acquisition and technical assis-
tance. They indicated that other programs such as 
USDA Rural Development loans and grants could 
not serve the same function as the Woody Biomass 
Utilization Grant program as they did not seem to 
be well-funded, focused on forest products, or in 
line with their speciﬁc needs. Several interview-
ees also explained that a network of intermediar-
ies and helpful individuals from the Forest Service 
and nonproﬁt organizations were present to assist 
with all stages of the Woody Biomass Utilization 
Grant program, which improved program delivery, 
grant access, and learning and relationships across 
the region; and they did not see a similar network 
and resources available with other grant programs. 
However, three grantees had become successful 
during the study period in obtaining USDA Rural 
Development resources (Rural Business Enterprise 
Grants and a grant for a large collaborative project 
focused on dry forest management and economic 
development) for biomass utilization-related work. 
Further, interviewees from the Forest Service who 
were knowledgeable about the shift in Woody Bio-
mass Utilization Grant program focus reported mul-
tiple reasons. First, the Forest Service had received 
direction to fund engineering energy plans for wood 
energy projects from USDA because USDA leader-
ship saw the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant pro-
gram as redundant with existing Rural Development 
grants and loans. USDA requested that the Forest 
Service instead support these studies because they 
appeared to be an important niche and pivotal point 
in the biomass supply chain that was not being 
funded by any other USDA program. Second, chal-
lenges with the arrangements for leasing equipment, 
particularly with a lack of understanding of lease 
terms on the part of grantees, and the time that For-
est Service employees spent managing equipment 
paperwork due to Federal Acquisition Regulations 
(which required federal tracking of the equipment 
until the value would be less than $5000) report-
edly also contributed to the shift. Third, given the 
relatively small amount of funding for the Woody 
Biomass Utilization Grant program, USDA leader-
ship were interested in seeking a larger “bang for 
the buck” by focusing on engineering and design at 
more locations, and leveraging public and private 
ﬁnance from other sources.

20      The Impacts of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant Program in Eastern Oregon and Eastern Arizona
Eastern Arizona case study
Case study area
The study area of eastern Arizona is an informally-
deﬁned region of three counties—Navajo, Apache, 
and Greenlee—located in the eastern (north and 
central) portion of the state. There is no census-
designated metro area within the study area. These 
counties together represent about two percent of 
the state’s population, face persistent high unem-
ployment and poverty, and have slower population 
and economic growth than Arizona state averages. 
Navajo and Apache County are among the top 100 
lowest-income counties in the United States based 
on per capita income. They contain small, remote 
communities and several reservations. These towns 
are far from urban centers, limiting availability of 
resources, access to transportation, and market dis-
tribution channels.
Following the reduction in harvesting on regional 
national forests in the mid-1990s, most forest in-
dustry disappeared from the area along with tim-
ber-related workforce, equipment, and associated 
industries.17, 18 For example, harvest from Arizona 
national forests in 1996 dropped to about one-tenth 
of the harvest in 1990 and was mostly fuelwood, 
not industrial timber products.19 The timber-related 
infrastructure in eastern Arizona that did remain 
was relatively close to private and tribal forests. By 
2002, the timber processing capability of the region 
rebounded brieﬂy due to the availability of salvage 
sales, especially from the 2002 Rodeo-Chediski Fire. 
Prior to the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant pro-
gram, however, the only substantial infrastructure 
remaining was a paper mill and a bioenergy power 
plant on the western side of the study area. By 1999, 
the paper mill used only recycled material, which 
further decreased the demand for wood byproducts, 
and the power plant closed in March 2013.
Forest management context
The Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest is the only 
national forest in the study area. It includes one-
million acres of ponderosa pine and mixed conifer 
forests and has both dry and semi-arid climates. It 
lies within the White Mountains range, a transition 
zone south of the Colorado Plateau and north of 
the Arizona Basin.20 This national forest has expe-
rienced overgrazing, logging, and ﬁre suppression 
since the late 1800s, which has increased the risk 
of uncharacteristically severe wildﬁres.
Stakeholders and community members have come 
together around forest health and economic devel-
opment concerns, beginning in 1997 with a diverse 
group of stakeholders forming the Natural Resources 
Working Group in an effort to build consensus on 
forest restoration issues.21 Trade associations and 
nonproﬁt organizations such as Northern Arizona 
Wood Products Association (NAWPA), Little Colo-
rado River Plateau Resource Conservation and De-
velopment (RC&D), and the Southwest Sustainable 
Forest Partnership (SWSFP) have also been involved 
in supporting the redevelopment of a regional forest 
products industry.
Two of the largest wildﬁres in Arizona’s history (the 
Rodeo-Chediski Fire in 2002 and the Wallow Fire 
in 2011) burned about half a million acres each in 
the White Mountains. The Rodeo-Chediski Fire also 
spurred the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest and 
stakeholders to take a new approach to forest health 
challenges. In August 2004, the Apache-Sitgreaves 
awarded a ten-year stewardship contract to treat 
150,000 acres of primarily small-diameter ponderosa 
pine, with an emphasis on treating wildland-urban 
interface areas. The White Mountain Stewardship 
Project (WMSP) was the ﬁrst ten-year stewardship 
contract in the nation.22 The contract was awarded 
to a single contractor, and it paid on a per acre basis 
to perform fuels reduction and remove woody bio-
mass from the national forest. The White Mountains’ 
Multi-Party Monitoring Board formed to monitor the 
WMSP.
The WMSP has helped revive active forest manage-
ment and has been a primary source of forest-related 
economic activity in the region. The WMSP con-
tractor provided four types of materials through the 
contract: 1) clean chips, 2) dirty chips (commercial-
grade pellets, biomass); 3) round wood (ﬁve to nine-
inch diameter trees); and 4) saw timber (nine-inch 

The Impacts of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant Program in Eastern Oregon and Eastern Arizona      21
and greater diameter trees). From 2005–08, 20 small 
forest products enterprises utilized these materials 
for manufacturing (pallets, moulding, furniture, and 
small lumber), energy production (pellets), livestock 
bedding, and soil fertilizers.23
Once the White Mountain stewardship contract ex-
pires in August of 2014, the Four Forest Restoration 
Initiative (4FRI), issued in 2012, will succeed it and 
be the largest ten-year stewardship contract in the 
nation. The analysis area of the 4FRI spans 2.4 mil-
lion acres across four forests in northern Arizona in 
the Apache-Sitgreaves, Tonto, Kaibab and Coconino 
National Forests, and is expected to provide 300,000 
acres of restoration work over a ten-year period.

Overview of grants
Twelve grants were awarded in eastern Arizona from 
2005–10, and one of the grants received additional 
investment from the American Recovery and Rein-
vestment Act (ARRA) (see Table 7, below). Grant 
recipients were located in or close to the WMSP 
area on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest (see 
Figure 3, page 22). Most grantees operated primarily 
in the White Mountains, with the exception of one 
located southwest of the White Mountains in San 
Carlos, and another that constructed a mill in the 
White Mountains but had its main ofﬁce in Phoe-
nix. Two of the Arizona grantees each received

two grants from the program. Interviews were not 
conducted with two grantees due to the early termi-
nation of the grant in one case, and grantee health 
concerns in the other. Four of the grantees used the 
funds to construct, upgrade or improve mills, and 
the remainder used the funding to purchase other 
processing equipment for animal bedding, mulch, 
and other non-saw timber products.   
Of the twelve full-term grants in eastern Arizona, 
awards ranged from $243,500 to $350,000. We 
eliminated two unsuccessful grants from the eco-
nomic impact analysis. Although the total awarded 
amount was $3.2 million, grant amounts actually 
spent were $2.6 million, matched with an addition-
al $4.9 million of funding from other sources (see 
Table 8, above, and Figure 4, left). Most of the grant 
funds and nearly 54 percent of total spending were 
used to purchase equipment (see Table 9, page 24). 
Unlike eastern Oregon, there were few suppliers of 
forest products equipment in eastern Arizona. Con-
sequently, grantees in Arizona reported that they 
purchased all of their equipment outside of the state 
(e.g. in Wisconsin and Minnesota) or the country (in 
Canada), and their budget requests often included 
travel expenses to research and buy the equipment. 
Similar to eastern Oregon, wages paid to employees 
of the grantees were the second-largest expenditure 
category. Construction of facilities to house the 
equipment was also a common expense. 
Grant impacts at the enterprise scale
We examined program impacts on individual en-
terprises, which included: creating jobs and other 
economic impacts; and improving their ability to ac-
cess supply, diversify product lines, obtain capital, 
and use matching resources. 
Grant and match purchases impacts
The ten successful grants in eastern Arizona gen-
erated a total of $7.4 million in new expenditures 
($1.2 million per year) (see Table 10, page 25). These 
grants have generated 45 full-time-equivalent jobs 
(about 7.5 jobs per year for 6 years), $3.7 million 
in wages ($0.6 million per year) and $6.6 million 
in economic activities ($1.1 million per year), and 
contributed $0.29 million to the state and local tax

revenue ($49,000 per year). Matching funds gener-
ated the majority of in-state economic impacts as 
grantees spent most grant funds outside of the state 
on equipment purchases. For example, there was 
no economic impact to the state of Arizona from 
grant expenditures in 2009, as the grantees reported 
that they spent all of their grant funds on equipment 
outside of the state. If a portion of the equipment 
purchase had occurred in the state, the economic 
impacts of the grants could have been much greater. 
Diversiﬁcation of supply and product lines
Grantees invested in diversifying both their sup-
ply and products. Four of the grantees used funds 
to construct sawmills or outﬁt existing sawmills to 
process small-diameter logs. This allowed small-
diameter biomass to be used for higher-value out-
comes as lumber. These grantees chose to invest in 
milling to recover more product and value from logs; 
diversify product lines and meet market demands; 
and to become more competitive by increasing vol-

26      The Impacts of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant Program in Eastern Oregon and Eastern Arizona
ume, eliminating middlemen by tightening supply 
chains, and increasing quality controls. One mill 
increased its production from two- to six-million 
board feet annually over the six-year period. One 
grant recipient remarked that “the sawmill is one 
of the best tools we have” to manage and treat the 
forest. Another grantee described the importance of 
having a sawmill in the area for overall industry 
success, because a large mill could process large 
volumes and manufacture ﬁnished wood products 
at competitive prices.
Many grantees expanded and diversiﬁed their prod-
ucts to utilize different types of biomass through in-
tegrated strategies. For example, several enterprises 
processed mid- to lower-grade lumber from small-di-
ameter logs into pallets, dimensional lumber, round 
wood, and laminated beams; used bark for mulch; 
and processed chips into pellets for energy. The 
proﬁts from the higher-value goods allowed these 
companies to process and sell the lower-value prod-
ucts, thus providing economic incentive to process 
the byproducts and utilize more raw material. 
Due to the depressed housing market, several enter-
prises also used their grants to adapt by diversify-
ing away from products reliant on that industry. For 
example, changing the ﬁrm’s product line from soil 
amendments used in the housing industry to animal 
bedding, one recipient said, “kept the lights on.” For 
the same reason, a Woody Biomass Utilization Grant 
enabled the transformation of another grantee’s pro-
duction from manufacturing sill plates, vigas, and 
railings for homes to pressure-treated agricultural 
and highway guardrail posts.
Grant impacts and issues at the regional 
and industry scale
We examined the impacts of these grants on overall 
industry capacity and biomass markets. We con-
sidered industry capacity to include the strength, 
diversity, and distribution of enterprises and inter-
mediaries.
Overall industry capacity
The Woody Biomass Utilization Grant program was 
the primary means of supporting the redevelopment 
of an eastern Arizona forest products industry. Many 
recipients stated that it was instrumental in increas-
ing overall capacity in the area by either starting up 
or expanding numerous processing enterprises. Im-
portantly, the location of new processing infrastruc-
ture within the White Mountains area decreased 
processing infrastructure’s distance from harvesting 
operations on national forest land, reducing haul 
distances and associated costs.
One grant for processing equipment added several 
key pieces of equipment that had not been present 
in the region. New in-woods chippers and grinders 
reduced biomass volume, in turn reducing hauling 
costs that often limit successful utilization of low-
value woody biomass. In addition, chippers and 
grinders were the ﬁrst step in creating products such 
as mulch and stove pellets from material that tradi-
tionally had not been utilized. The Woody Biomass 
Utilization Grant program was also instrumental in 
supporting new mechanized harvesting approaches. 
A new piece of equipment purchased by one of the 
grantees, the Waratah processing head, was key in 
increasing utilization efﬁciencies and reducing costs 
by cutting material to length, sorting it in the woods, 
and decreasing overall handling, thereby increas-
ing productivity and proﬁts. One stakeholder inter-
viewee stated, “It changed the way we did work in 
the woods.” Once the Waratah processing head was 
tested and proven, other operators in the area also 
began using the equipment, and most were using it 
by the end of the study period. 
The Woody Biomass Utilization Grant program also 
supported four grantees in building or increasing the 
capacity of sawmills. Expanded sawmill capacity 
was important to industry success in the area because 
increased processing of material volume helped 
maintain competitive manufactured wood products 
prices. In addition, sawmills that can process both 
large and small logs can increase value from biomass 
and generate residuals that can help biomass enter-
prises when supply from the forest is inconsistent.
Building facility and service networks
Grantees described how the Woody Biomass Utiliza-
tion Grant program helped build a network of pro-
cessing facilities and services that several biomass 
enterprises shared, which improved their efﬁciency. 

The Impacts of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant Program in Eastern Oregon and Eastern Arizona      27
For example, a “community kiln” was installed that 
could be used by multiple enterprises in the area 
to efﬁciently dry lumber, increase lumber quality, 
improve local wood utilization, and increase pro-
duction. In addition, the Woody Biomass Utiliza-
tion Grant program helped ensure that a pressure 
treatment facility was available to multiple grantees 
for treating wood for outdoor uses. Grantees also 
explained how these networks could be further ex-
panded with the addition of a biomass plant that 
could fill a gap by processing pellets for energy. 
They also suggested that installation of other key 
equipment, such as truck scales, at strategic loca-
tions would improve efﬁciency for enterprises as a 
whole. A stakeholder interviewee described one area 
within the case study region, the town of Eagar, Ari-
zona, on the eastside of the White Mountains, as a 
“microcosm” that had developed valuable networks 
and created a balanced system. 
Market effects and challenges
Market conditions for housing and broader econom-
ic trends, as well as distance to markets, affect for-
est products enterprises. Despite the many positive 
effects that the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant 
program had on eastern Arizona’s forest products 
industry, poor and distant markets presented a sig-
niﬁcant challenge. During the study period, grantees 
faced difﬁculty in sales and ﬁnding markets as most 
of the small-diameter wood products were tied to 
the housing market, which became more and more 
depressed and reached a low in 2009. One grantee 
that was primarily involved in construction at the 
time described a 70 percent drop in sales. Com-
peting in the global market with larger companies 
added to the challenges that grantees faced in be-
coming established and gaining market share. High 
shipping, freight, and fuel costs for moving products 
to market from the rural region were also a challenge 
for the grantees, many of whom did not adequately 
budget for these expenses.
However, at the time of our study, grantees reported 
that these market limitations were beginning to dis-
sipate because prices for material in other parts of 
the country and Canada were ﬁnally beginning to 
increase and local prices were more equitable. One 
grantee said that while the business had initially 
been a struggle, markets were now beginning to 
open for the ﬁrm’s products, allowing the ﬁrm to pay 
more for the raw material (e.g. from $20 per green ton 
to $32 per ton), which will eventually reduce hazard-
ous fuels treatment costs for the Forest Service.
Intermediary roles and impacts
Unlike eastern Oregon, there was no intermediary 
organization receiving a Woody Biomass Utilization 
Grant grant in eastern Arizona. However, interme-
diary organizations, as well as the Forest Service 
Regional Ofﬁce played a role in Woody Biomass Uti-
lization Grant program investments. We examined 
their roles in program delivery.    
Intermediary business assistance
Three organizations with missions primarily fo-
cused on sustainable forests, wood utilization, and 
rural economic development helped provide inter-
mediary business assistance: the Northern Arizona 
Wood Products Association, the Little Colorado 
River Plateau Resource Conservation and Develop-
ment, and the Small Business Development Center 
at Northland Pioneer College. These organizations 
formed a team that assisted applicants with proposal 
development including ﬁnancial projections, plan-
ning, and grant reporting and administration. Inter-
viewees noted that the support and dedication of 
this team made a noticeable difference in program 
delivery and that the program’s success was tied to 
their commitment. In addition, FPL staff provided 
technical assistance that aided grantees in achiev-
ing project success.
The Forest Service’s Regional Ofﬁce also assisted in 
all aspects of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant 
program in eastern Arizona. A single biomass coor-
dinator oversaw all of the grants (from 2005–2012), 
providing consistency throughout the grant pro-
cess. The coordinator solicited potential grantees, 
helped craft and review proposals, and adminis-
tered the grants. The coordinator worked with the 
Northern Arizona Wood Products Association and 
the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, which also 
helped recruit grantees. Together, they strategically 
sought applications from businesses that would 
bridge lacking components of woody biomass in-
frastructure in eastern Arizona. 

28      The Impacts of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant Program in Eastern Oregon and Eastern Arizona
National Forest System dimensions
We explored the effects of grants on acres treated 
and reduction of treatment costs on the Apache-
Sitgreaves National Forest, as well as the role that 
national forest units played in assuring biomass was 
accessible to grantees. 
Providing access to biomass
Of the ten grantees that we interviewed, nine uti-
lized biomass directly from the national forest alone, 
and one business utilized approximately ﬁfty per-
cent each from sawmill residuals and the forest. The 
WMSP has been the sole source of biomass material 
from the national forest. The Forest Service hoped to 
treat 15,000 acres annually in this ten-year contract. 
But enterprises that utilized only forest biomass de-
scribed challenges due to lack of supply, including 
limitations in production, delays in promoting their 
new product lines, inability to ﬁll backlogs of orders, 
and difﬁculty in planning sawmill production with-
out knowing the quantities and sizes of raw mate-
rial that would be available. Stakeholders concurred, 
and noted that this supply issue existed prior to the 
stewardship contract, which made it difﬁcult for 
biomass or wood products businesses in the area to 
secure ﬁnancing. Grantees also expressed frustra-
tion about the lack of timely salvage logging prior 
to insect infestations and the subsequent lost value 
following the 2011 Wallow Fire. They reported that 
this compounded the lack-of-supply issues and the 
losses in sales and customers that they already faced 
due to poor market conditions.  
Several grantees also pinpointed the limitations of 
the environmental planning (NEPA) process as one 
of the largest barriers they faced, suggesting that the 
Forest Service lacked capacity and funding to com-
plete planning to match business demand for raw 
material supply. However, one grantee felt that the 
landscape scale 4FRI project might help with this ca-
pacity issue in the future as it includes signiﬁcantly 
more acres in the analysis, and should require less 
time and resources than planning for several smaller 
projects.
Another supply challenge that grantees identiﬁed 
was that one contractor controlled access to biomass 
and its price under the WMSP. Several grantees de-
scribed this as a “monopoly” and suggested that 
contracts should be divided among a larger number 
of contractors to allow for competitive bids, ﬂexibil-
ity of supply, and competitive pricing. One grantee 
further suggested that the WMSP contractor’s ability 
to manufacture end products gave the contractor a 
signiﬁcant supply chain advantage and assured this 
contractor the best price on ﬁnished products for a 
ﬁnite consumer base. To alleviate these conﬂicting 
interests, several grantees suggested close oversight 
of the raw material stream from the WMSP contrac-
tor through the distribution and utilization channels. 
Impacts on hazardous fuels reduction and costs
There were diverging views between stakeholder 
interviewees on whether treatment costs were re-
duced. In the short-term, because the WMSP was 
already in place, the price paid to the federal gov-
ernment for fuels reduction did not change. How-
ever, the WMSP contractor reduced treatment costs 
because the contractor was using material that had 
previously been piled and burned. Exact costs per 
acre prior to the program are not known, but costs 
after the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant program 
averaged $550 per acre.24 A monitoring report on the 
WMSP suggests that the effects of increased biomass 
utilization capacity on the national forest were no-
table because costs per acre remained stable during 
an unprecedented downturn in the wood products 
markets; and, further, because contractors began to 
treat more complex areas, yet costs did not increase.
Impacts on green ton removal
The eastern Arizona grantees generally purchased 
biomass from the WMSP contractor rather than 
harvesting it themselves. Therefore, most were un-
certain of the total quantities of green tons being 
harvested. However, the Forest Products Laboratory 
reported that the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant 
program spurred the collection of a total of 337,860 
green tons of woody biomass in eastern Arizona 
during the study period. Collection increased from 
about 33,000 green tons in 2006 to over 80,000 green 
tons in 2011 (see Table 11, page 29). The collection 
and delivery reported during the study period gen-
erated 114 jobs (19 per year) and about $19 million 
($3.2 million per year) in new economic activity in 
the state of Arizona.

Policy and program dimensions
Prior to the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant pro-
gram, stakeholders in the White Mountains area had 
focused on collaborative resource management and 
enterprise development with the support of several 
programs and policies. Beginning in 1999, the Forest 
Service’s Economic Action Program (EAP) support-
ed the development of several regional and local in-
termediary entities that provided startup assistance 
and networking. By the time the Woody Biomass 
Utilization Grant program began, these entities had 
become key intermediaries for program delivery. 
These previous investments in both enterprise and 
intermediary capacity through EAP laid a solid 
foundation for the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant 
program to build on. Area stakeholders had also 
used resources from the National Fire Plan to de-
velop community wildﬁre protection plans in 2004, 
which helped identify and prioritize wildland-urban 
interface areas for fuels treatments. This layering of 
policies and programs helped the Woody Biomass 
Utilization Grant program become an effective next 
step that allowed numerous startup enterprises to 
move from planning to equipment acquisition and 
operation.  
As in eastern Oregon, grantees suggested that the 
Woody Biomass Utilization Grant program’s shift 
to engineering and energy grants was abrupt, and 
they were disappointed that resources were no

longer available for equipment purchases. There 
was relatively little outreach and explanation of 
the program’s change, and stakeholder interview-
ees thought the business community had not been 
prepared for the change. One interviewee described 
how prior to the transition, Woody Biomass Utili-
zation Grant program applicants were required to 
complete supply assessments and feasibility stud-
ies, which were useful to the types of enterprises 
in the region; but woody biomass energy studies 
were not a key need in the region. No businesses 
in the Southwest have received these grants since 
the transition (2011–12). One interviewee suggested 
that the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant program’s 
new focus would allow better leveraging of funds 
and larger-scale investments in bioenergy projects in 
the future, but another described it as “a mistake.” 
It is worth reiterating that, in the White Mountains, 
grantees faced the challenge of rebuilding a wood 
products industry while simultaneously adding 
enough value to low-quality wood to offset the ex-
penses of thinning projects. The successful grants 
in this region contributed signiﬁcantly to industry 
redevelopment; yet a shift from equipment pur-
chase support to planning and engineering support 
leaves places like eastern Arizona without support 
for achieving value-added production, as they see 
a need to continue to develop their infrastructure 
rather than design new energy facilities. 

30      The Impacts of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant Program in Eastern Oregon and Eastern Arizona
Discussion
This research has examined the delivery and im-
pacts of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant pro-
gram in eastern Oregon and eastern Arizona from 
2005–10. Using both economic impact and qualita-
tive analysis, we suggest several comparative ﬁnd-
ings and lessons learned from the case studies. 
Economic impacts varied due to the differences in 
industry capacity in each case study area
Grants in both study areas were mostly (an average 
of 70 percent) for purchase of processing or utili-
zation equipment, and the wages required to ﬁnd, 
deliver, and operationalize it. Yet the economic im-
pacts of these purchases and where they accrued 
differed. Oregon grantees purchased more of their 
equipment from Oregon vendors than did Arizona 
grantees (who purchased no equipment in state), 
perhaps because Oregon’s forest resource industry 
is more intact than Arizona’s and equipment dealers 
were more available within Oregon. The outcomes 
of utilization also varied because of the different na-
ture of each industry. Economic impacts generated 
per 10,000 green tons were actually larger in eastern 
Arizona than in eastern Oregon, suggesting that bio-
mass utilization is more labor intensive, which cre-
ates greater economic impact, in Arizona and more 
mechanically intensive in Oregon. In both cases, 
match dollars created more signiﬁcant economic im-
pact, as they were more likely to be spent on labor 
and services within the case study areas. Therefore, 
it was not only the grants themselves but also the 
concomitant investments made by businesses that 
created economic activity. 
The Woody Biomass Utilization Grant program 
made diverse investments across the biomass sup-
ply chain
During the study period, the Woody Biomass Uti-
lization Grant program supported many different 
activities related to biomass utilization as wide-
ranging as providing technical assistance, increasing 
harvesting equipment, upgrading existing wood pro-
cessing facilities, and building new sawmills. This 
broad scope meant that it was addressing multiple 
issues and simultaneously investing in multiple 
capacities in both case study areas. This approach 
was well-suited to the multi-faceted enterprise and 
industry challenges that biomass utilization from 
public lands poses. However, grants at the same 
places in the supply chain yielded different out-
comes in each location. For example, grantees in 
eastern Oregon were able to add new equipment to 
scale up their harvesting capacity without seeking or 
building markets because the grantees were already 
established federal contractors with end users for 
their products. In contrast, grantees in eastern Ari-
zona had to do the work of purchasing and building 
facilities, obtaining supply, and developing markets, 
all of which took signiﬁcant time and resources yet 
was extremely important for rebuilding an industry 
in Arizona.
National forest management affected biomass avail-
ability
Grantees in both cases faced difficulty obtaining 
consistent biomass supply from national forests. As 
a result, in eastern Oregon many grantees used their 
equipment on private timberland instead, and some 
grantees in eastern Arizona removed biomass from 
reservations. However, this strategy is not sustain-
able for these enterprises, as large percentages of 
land in both case study areas are federally owned, 
and businesses need access to them to maintain 
long-term health. Grantees in both cases—but espe-
cially in eastern Arizona—expressed concern about 
their ability to continue to invest in their businesses 
when they were uncertain of future supply through 
the 4FRI project. 
There were differences and similarities in why 
grantees faced public lands supply challenges. In 
both cases, grantees felt that national forest manage-
ment often did not appear to be coordinated with or 
accelerated on behalf of the Woody Biomass Utili-
zation Grant program. In eastern Arizona, grantees 
were operating on one national forest with a large 
stewardship contract for service work and biomass 
removal that a single contractor held, so the con-
tractor’s choices greatly affected grantee access to 
raw material on federal land. Thus, although there 
had been landscape-scale planning to help increase 
biomass utilization in this area, the centralized ap-
proach limited supply from federal lands to the 
grantees. In eastern Oregon, grantees were operat-

ing across six national forests that did not share any 
particular strategy or commitment to biomass utili-
zation; yet there were more diverse, ﬂexible mecha-
nisms (both timber sales and stewardship contracts) 
for enterprises to access biomass without a single 
contractor mediating the relationship between fed-
eral lands and material supply.
Biomass utilization increased in both study areas 
as a result of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant 
program
We found that biomass utilization increased in both 
Oregon and Arizona as a result of the Woody Bio-
mass Utilization Grant program. More green tons 
were removed and utilized than prior to the pro-
gram’s existence. Other incentives like the WMSP 
and other large stewardship contracts, Oregon’s Bio-
mass Producers or Collectors Tax Credit, biomass 
utilization projects funded by the American Recov-
ery and Reinvestment Act, and the federal Biomass 
Crop Assistance Program have also been applied 
in eastern Oregon to increase biomass utilization. 
This suite of policy tools during the study period 
may have provided sufﬁcient incentives at the right 
leverage points to spur growth in utilization in that 
region. This also reﬂects how eastern Oregon’s for-
est products industry has been more intact than 
eastern Arizona’s. If eastern Arizona’s industry can 
continue to grow, rates of utilization may increase 
in the future.
Lessons
Careful grantee review and intermediary engage-
ment improved grant success
In both cases, grantee characteristics such as rele-
vant skills, experience, and “good business sense” as 
well as the ability to learn from challenges and reach 
out for assistance when needed, were important to 
their success. In addition, having grant reviewers 
that included knowledgeable parties outside of the 
Forest Service to work extensively with potential 
grantees before submission or to recruit candidates 
helped ensure that most grantees had feasible plans, 
or the capacity to change plans and succeed. Inter-
mediary assistance both before and during grants 
may increase business capacity and likelihood of 
grant success. It also suggests that a robust review 
panel including external participants with diverse 
expertise (e.g. technical, ﬁnancial, etc.) could be use-
ful to examine grant proposals for: 1) the background 
and history of the speciﬁc equipment, 2) assuring 
grantee’s experiential levels match their proposed 
scope of work, 3) legal authority/licensing and, 4) 
sustainable business plans.
Deliberate investment in technical assistance to 
help grantees understand equipment, technology, 
and markets helped increase the viability of grants. 
In particular, investment in market education and 
development helped guide grantee investments and 
build capacity. Grantees in both cases faced signiﬁ-
cant technical and market challenges, given that 
many did not have prior experience operating in the 
biomass business environment. For example, some 
grantees in the Arizona case did not add enough 
value to their products, create a viable specialty 
product niche, or have strong understanding of and 
access to the right markets. Technical assistance 
about how to select the most efﬁcient and effective 
use for small-diameter pine was provided in east-
ern Arizona to help ameliorate these issues. In the 
Oregon case, grantees who sought to enter markets 
that were not strong during the study period, such 
as the electricity market, were severely challenged 
and could not complete their grants. Grantees de-
scribed the importance of obtaining technical assis-
tance from intermediary nonproﬁts and Forest Ser-
vice Regional Biomass Coordinators, in addition to 
the support, ﬂexibility, and knowledge that Forest 
Products Laboratory personnel offered to overcome 
these challenges.  
Coordination and engagement with national forest 
management is as important as enterprise invest-
ment
The Woody Biomass Utilization Grant program built 
enterprise capacity, but did not speciﬁcally invest in 
agency capacity to plan for biomass utilization. The 
ability of national forest and Regional Ofﬁce staff to 
plan and implement land management is essential to 
increasing acres treated and reducing costs. Deliber-
ate, coordinated investment in agency capacity at 
local levels, particularly on how to use stewardship 
contracting and how to build working relationships 
with local enterprises to understand their abilities 

32      The Impacts of the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant Program in Eastern Oregon and Eastern Arizona
and needs, might help improve land management 
outcomes. Networking and peer-learning between 
the national forests in eastern Oregon, for example, 
could accelerate this knowledge and transfer skills 
more consistently across the region. Joint capacity-
building between agency personnel and stakeholder 
entities such as community-based organizations and 
collaborative groups may also be useful in building 
more sustainable local knowledge bases, given that 
agency personnel frequently “turn over” and tend to 
not remain on any one forest for very long.   
Lack of monitoring limited measurement of impacts
In both cases but particularly in eastern Oregon, 
grant reporting on measures such as green tons and 
acres treated was inconsistent. Interviews revealed 
that depending on the type of grantee enterprise, 
they did not have an accurate understanding of 
acres treated; e.g. in the White Mountains steward-
ship contract, where the sole contractor treated acres 
and the grantees purchased raw material.   Although 
reporting from one national forest in eastern Oregon 
was fairly consistent due to one dedicated person, 
others provided little information. This suggests that 
what to measure, who measures what, and how re-
porting is administered matter. Requesting informa-
tion and measures that grantees will readily know 
and that are focused on the business outcomes may 
increase reporting. Further, additional close contact 
and guidance on measurement between the FPL, the 
Regional Ofﬁces, and national forest units may help 
improve the availability and accuracy of data. This 
would allow for greater understanding of the im-
pacts of programs on biomass utilization. 
Conclusion
The Woody Biomass Utilization Grant program was 
a unique resource for accelerating biomass utiliza-
tion in a public lands context. Unlike other poli-
cies and federal programs, it directly supported the 
acquisition of equipment, the growth of regional 
industry, and networks of technical assistance and 
learning. This relatively small ($5 million autho-
rized annually nationwide) program sustained and 
accelerated biomass utilization across eastern Or-
egon, ﬁlling several gaps in industry capacity; and 
was the primary source of investment in the rede-
velopment of an entire forest products industry in 
eastern Arizona. Its most clear accomplishments 
have been its signiﬁcant contributions to biomass 
processing capacity and associated rural economic 
development, which occurred despite challenging 
market and economic conditions. The program’s 
ability to increase acres treated and reduce costs 
was less discernible, particularly because 1) nu-
merous other factors beyond enterprise capacity af-
fect these dynamics and 2) there was no systematic 
investment in agency capacity to accelerate project 
planning and implementation. It is also important 
to note that given the complexities of public land 
management and associated enterprise develop-
ment, strategies such as the Woody Biomass Utiliza-
tion Grant program are critical to increasing biomass 
utilization, but they achieve greater outcomes when 
incorporated with other tools to improve agency and 
stakeholder capacity, active land management, and 
long-term industry sustainability.

Economic Impacts Methods
Input-output model
We used an input-output model to measure the 
economic impacts of the Woody Biomass Utiliza-
tion Grant program from 2005–10. An input-output 
model measures how any individual change in the 
economy ripples through the rest of the economy. 
Input-output models represent the complex set of in-
ter-industry exchanges that occurs in the production 
and consumption of that economy’s goods and ser-
vices. Changes in one sector of the economy cause 
industries to respond by changing their production 
levels and adjusting their consumption of interme-
diary products purchased from industries in other 
sectors. Input-output analysis deﬁnes how inter-in-
dustry transactions between different components 
of regional production are translated into various 
components of regional income.25 The general input 
output model for an economy in which each sector 
produces one product, xi, can be written as: 
is the total ﬁnal demand for all i sectors in an econo-
my, and A is a matrix of coefﬁcients aij representing 
the requirements from sector j to produce one unit 
of product x in sector i. Roughly translated from 
mathematical notation, the above formula indicates 
that the total ﬁnal demand in an economy is equal to 
the total value of the goods and services produced 
in the economy plus the total value of the inter-
industry exchange needed to produce those goods 
and services.
We used the economic impact modeling software 
IMPLAN 3.026 to describe the impacts from Woody 
Biomass Utilization grants on Oregon and Arizona’s 
economies. We used 2011 Oregon and Arizona data 
from the Minnesota IMPLAN Group (MIG) as the ba-
sic economic structure of the two states’ economies. 
MIG data are calibrated to national and local data 
from a number of sources. The Bureau of Econom-
ic Analysis (BEA) develops national input-output 
matrices every ﬁve years using data collected from 
the Department of Census’ U.S. Economic Census 
and other programs. MIG estimates local and state 
level input-output matrices by calibrating the BEA 
national input-output matrices with data from the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Department of the 
Census, and the BEA. All national and local data 
are classiﬁed according to IMPLAN’s industrial sec-
toring scheme, which has its origins in the North 
American Industrial Classiﬁcation System sectoring 
scheme. We adjusted all results from IMPLAN to 
2013 dollars.
Grant impact models
Most grants were used to purchase equipment that 
would increase biomass collection and utilization 
from national forests. We therefore divided the im-
pact models into two components: 1) initial pur-
chases impacts and 2) utilization impacts (through 
2011). To develop the initial purchase impact model 
for Oregon and Arizona, we obtained grant propos-
als, including requested and matching budget infor-
mation, all available grant progress and ﬁnal reports, 
and biomass utilization data for each grant from the 
USDA Forest Products Laboratory. Requested grant 
budgets and matching funds were categorized into 
appropriate IMPLAN sectors (e.g., wholesale trade, 
employee compensation, wood product production). 
The expenditure proﬁles were averaged across all 
grants by state, and coefﬁcients represent the pro-
portion of total project dollars spent in budget cat-
egory. Several modiﬁcations were made to the grant 
budgets to reﬂect deviations from the original grant 
proposals discovered during the course of qualita-
tive interviews. 
Utilization impacts were estimated using two meth-
ods—one for Oregon and one for Arizona. The Or-
egon utilization impact model was based on an 
existing biomass utilization impact model created 
to estimate the impact of the Oregon Biomass Pro-
ducers or Consumers Tax Credit.27 This model was 
estimated based on surveys of biomass utilization 
contractors in Oregon. The model shows the eco-
nomic impacts to employment, wages, and overall 
economic output per 10,000 bone dry tons of bio-
mass collected and delivered to a utilization facility

(e.g., a sawmill with a combined heat and electric 
generation facility). We obtained total utilization re-
cords reported by each grantee from the USDA For-
est Products Laboratory and applied those records 
to the biomass utilization impact model to estimate 
the impact of biomass utilization from the Woody 
Biomass Utilization Grant program in Oregon.
The Arizona utilization impact model was devel-
oped using similar procedures. Because we did not 
have information to develop the production func-
tion, we used the from Oregon model, assuming 
production costs for forest biomass utilization in 
Arizona were similar to those for Oregon. Assuming 
50 percent moisture content of delivered biomass 
and the average delivered price per bone dry ton 
to be $30.94, we calculated the average total log-
ging, transportation and overhead costs per 10,000 
bone dry tons of biomass utilization. From the total 
utilization records reported by each grantee from 
the USDA Forest Products Laboratory (as of 2011), 
we calculated the total production costs and their 
economic impacts in Arizona.
We used IMPLAN 3.0 to estimate the employment, 
economic, and tax impacts of the Woody Biomass 
Utilization Grant program. We present the results of 
our impact analyses in several ways. First, we dis-
aggregated impacts to direct, indirect, and induced 
impacts. We deﬁned direct effects as those economic 
impacts that arise directly from grant spending (e.g., 
the purchase of new utilization equipment) and from 
biomass utilization that was reported as the result of 
the grant. Indirect effects arise out of the patterns of 
trade in the directly-affected sectors as they demand 
goods and services from other businesses, govern-
ment entities, and households. For example, new 
equipment creates a new demand for supplies and 
services required to run and maintain that equip-
ment. Finally, induced effects represent the house-
hold consumption created by wages paid to employ-
ees in the sectors affected by direct and indirect ef-
fects. Induced effects are often considered somewhat 
differently than direct and indirect effects because 
of their dependence on macroeconomic conditions 
rather than on industrial patterns of trade.28 Induced 
effects may be greater when unemployment is high 
because ﬁrms can easily ﬁll new demand by hiring 
workers, but when the economy is robust and un-
employment is low employers may seek to improve 
worker productivity and overall efﬁciency rather 
than allocate wages to new employees. Given the 
economic climate during the majority of our analysis 
period, we expect that induced effects derived from 
our models will adequately represent the impacts to 
the economy; however, we caution that expansions 
in productivity and efﬁciency would likely gener-
ate less induced effects than initial investments. As 
such, we suggest that readers view the induced ef-
fect as a guide rather than a deﬁnitive outcome.
Second, we broke grantee spending into direct grant 
spending and match spending. Grant dollars were 
leveraged with other non-grant dollars, or match. 
One measure of grant effectiveness is if a grant en-
ables a project that requires spending of some non-
grant dollars, in addition to the grant dollars, that 
would not otherwise occur. Grantees reported match 
dollars in addition to their grant dollars. We present 
economic impact results in terms of grant spending, 
match spending, and the economic impact leveraged 
by the grant.
Third, we present both annual impacts and total 
impacts. We used qualitative interview data and 
grant reporting data to identify the year in which 
equipment was purchased or other major expendi-
tures occurred (this was not necessarily the year the 
grant was awarded because it took some grantees a 
year or more to identify and purchase equipment). 
Utilization impacts were estimated by dividing the 
total utilization reported (from the grant award date 
through 2011) by the number of years material was 
utilized. Although this approach assumes equal uti-
lization per year when there were likely ﬂuctuations 
by year, we had no better data on which to allocate 
the temporal ﬂow of utilization. Examining the to-
tal impacts, which represent the sum of all annual 
impacts, circumvents any errors in annual impact 
this assumption created. Readers should be careful, 
however, interpreting total employment impacts and 
jobs are reported by job-years. For example, a total 
employment impact of 100 jobs is equal to ten jobs 
for ten years or ﬁfty jobs for two years.
