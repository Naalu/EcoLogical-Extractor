Kirk Smith Memorial Scholarship Fund to help ERI students 
 
(Flagstaff, Ariz.)  A scholarship fund, memorializing Flagstaff outdoorsman and 
firefighter Kirk Smith, is being set up at Northern Arizona University to help 
undergraduate research assistants working for the Ecological Restoration Institute with 
the financial challenges of pursuing a higher education. 
 
Organizers of the Kirk Smith Memorial Scholarship Fund have a goal of raising $1,500 
by July 1, 2005.  Scholarships in the amount of $250 will be available beginning in fall 
2005. 
 
Kirk Smith was born with a heritage of forestry.  He was the son of Kathy and Doc 
Smith, a lifelong forester who worked in the Forest Service as a smokejumper and 
district ranger and currently is an associate director at the ERI.  Kirk was the 
superintendent of the Mormon Lake Hotshots.   
 
“Kirk would always try to hold a slot or two open on the hotshot team for forestry college 
students, knowing they’d have to start a little later because of school obligations,” said 
Doc Smith. 
 
Kirk died at the age of 37 from cancer in 2002.  Friends remember him as a sportsman 
with a remarkable zest for life, great integrity and a quiet determination to do the right 
thing.  
 
Kirk’s wife Jessie and daughters Kyla, 11, Kayla, 9, and Madison, 2, live in Flagstaff.   
 
“Kirk would be honored and completely astonished to know he’s being remembered in 
this way,” said Doc.   
 
Those interested in contributing to the fund can find a pledge form on the ERI Web site, 
www.eri.nau.edu/announcement.aspx, or contact Robin Long at 523-7187.  Donations 
are tax deductible.
