Forest Management and the Dead Wood 
Resource in Ponderosa Pine Forests: 
Effects on Small Mammals1 
 
 
Carol L. Chambers2 
 
 
Abstract 
Changes in vegetation structure and composition affect habitat for wildlife. Species such as 
small mammals that are restricted to small home ranges and are relatively immobile may be 
most affected since it is more difficult to find and move to new habitat. In the southwestern 
United States, forest management treatments (thinning and prescribed burning) are being 
implemented to alter structure and function of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) ecosystems 
and recreate pre-settlement (ca. 1870) tree species composition and size class distribution. 
These forest restoration treatments will affect the availability of dead wood to wildlife (e.g., 
prescribed fires may consume dead wood, forest operations may create snags and logs). I live-
trapped small mammals in a northern Arizona ponderosa pine forest prior to restoration 
treatment and found that mouse species (Peromyscus species) were associated with some dead 
wood elements (e.g., Gambel oak [Quercus gambelii] snags, ponderosa pine snags, ponderosa 
pine stumps).  
 
Introduction 
Standing dead trees and logs are important components of wildlife habitat. They 
provide nesting, roosting, feeding, loafing, and storage sites for over 75 species of 
birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians in the Southwest (Degenhardt and others 
1996, Rabe 1998, Scott 1979, Scott and Patton 1989). Many of these animals have 
important ecological roles, such as dispersing seeds and mychorrhizal fungi, helping 
to control insect populations, and serving as prey for other species (Bergvinson and 
Borden 1992, Maser and others 1988, Peterson 1980, Ward and Block 1995). 
Vertebrate population densities may change in response to change in vegetation 
structure and composition (see for example, Chambers and others 1999, Scott 1979, 
Szaro and Balda 1986). Although some wildlife species (birds, large ungulates) are 
highly mobile and can move to more favorable habitat (assuming it is unoccupied), 
many species (small mammals, reptiles, amphibians) are often restricted to relatively 
small areas (i.e., 2 to 20 ha per individual or population) (e.g., Hall and Morrison 
1997). Forest management practices may have differential effects on vertebrate 
populations depending on the scale at which the treatments are applied and the size of 
habitat used by an organism. 
Ponderosa pine forests cover about 3.2 million ha in Arizona and New Mexico 
(Klemmedson and Smith 1979). These forests appear to be at increasing risk of

catastrophic fire as a result of 130 years of Euro-American influence. A combination 
of fire suppression, logging practices, insect infestations, livestock grazing, and a 
shift towards a warmer and wetter climate has altered the composition of ponderosa 
pine forests (Cochran and Hopkins 1991, Cooper 1960, Covington and Moore 1994, 
Grissino-Mayer and Swetnam 2000, Touchan and others 1996). Livestock grazing 
reduced native grasses and other fine fuels that spread low intensity fires. Grazing 
also exposed bare mineral soil, which allowed establishment of ponderosa pine 
seedlings in years following high cone production (Klemmedson and Smith 1979, 
Touchan and others 1996). Fire suppression has resulted in greater survival of young 
trees, contributing to forest densities of >3,000 trees/ha in the 1990s compared to 60 
trees/ha in 1876 (Mast and others 1999). 
Ecological restoration, using silvicultural tools such as thinning and prescribed 
burning, may help reestablish structure and function of indigenous ecosystems by 
recreating pre-settlement (ca. 1870) tree species composition and size class 
distribution and reestablishing a frequent, low intensity fire regime (Covington and 
others 1997). However, restoration treatments will affect the availability of dead 
wood to wildlife. Thinning and pruning may increase log and slash densities. Slash 
treatments that leave piles or windrows increase habitat for some vertebrates (e.g., 
small mammals, Goodwin and Hungerford 1979). Prescribed fire may increase or 
decrease the dead wood resource. Boucher and others (1999), Gaines and others 
(1958), and Gordon (1996) found that prescribed fire created dead wood; however, 
live trees killed by fire were predominantly small in diameter and therefore not 
effective replacements of large logs and snags. Prescribed fires will also incinerate 
existing snags and logs, removing up to 50 percent of ponderosa pine snags and 60 
percent of logs (Gaines and others 1958, Gordon 1996, Horton and Mannan 1986, 
Randall-Parker and Miller 2002). In addition, Horton and Mannan (1988) found that 
large (>30 cm dbh) and more decayed ponderosa pine snags were more flammable, 
and therefore more likely to be lost. This loss of large dead wood may be particularly 
detrimental to wildlife, because cavity nesters (birds and bats) select larger snags 
(>46 cm diameter), large snags persist longer than small snags (Neitro and others 
1985, Rabe and others 1998, Scott and Oldemeyer 1983), and replacement of large 
snags may take a long time (e.g., >200 years for a ponderosa pine to reach 46 cm dbh 
under normal stocking, site index 70 [Meyer 1961]). Large snags are often the origin 
of large logs, so fires may have both immediate and long-term impacts on both 
standing dead and down wood. 
If not incinerated, snags and logs may be altered by fire and their usefulness as 
wildlife habitat decreased (Gaines and others 1958, Gordon 1996). After a prescribed 
burn, Gordon (1996) suggested that the utility as habitat of >70 percent of logs in her 
study was decreased, because logs were charred and case-hardened, making them 
more difficult for animals to excavate. Most snags fell (50 percent, Gordon 1996), at 
which point they were considered useful as log habitat. Additional fires might further 
reduce available dead wood.  
What do we know specifically about use of dead wood in the Southwest? I 
found 41 articles (table 1) that described either dynamics of dead wood or use of 
dead wood as habitat for wildlife in the Southwest. The literature generally focused 
on ponderosa pine ecosystems (n = 32), although five papers described mixed conifer 
ecosystems and four papers described dead wood in both forest types. Snag dynamics 
or use was the most common topic discussed (n = 33). Of these, 11 papers described 
use of snags by primary or secondary cavity-nesting birds and 10 described other

681 
types of use by wildlife. The remaining 12 papers described snag recruitment and 
longevity, pre-settlement forest conditions in the Southwest, or effects of prescribed 
fire on dead wood. Fifteen papers discussed dynamics (n = 6) or wildlife use (n = 9) 
of logs. 
Of the 41 papers discussing dead wood in the Southwest, only 4 (Goodwin and 
Hungerford 1979, Kyle 2000, Smith and Mannan 1994, Ward and Block 1995) 
described small mammal use of down wood in ponderosa pine forests. I examined 
small mammal use of ponderosa pine stands in northern Arizona. My objective was 
to determine how the availability of standing and down wood and other habitat 
elements affected abundance of small mammals. The study was conducted in areas 
scheduled for forest restoration treatments (thinning, prescribed burning). From these 
data, I have speculated on how restoration may affect dead wood and impact small 
mammal communities. Following restoration treatments, stands will be resampled 
and pre- and post-treatment comparisons made.

Methods 
Study Area 
I live-trapped small mammals at Mt. Trumbull, in the Arizona Strip north of the 
Colorado River, in northern Arizona (latitude 36o 22’ 0”, longitude 113o 11’ 0”). The 
study area ranged from 2,055 to 2,277 m in elevation. Tree density averaged 1,642 
trees per ha, with ponderosa pine dominating (ponderosa pine averaged 90 percent of 
stand basal area). Gambel oak, pinyon pine (Pinus edulis), Utah juniper (Juniperus 
osteosperma), and New Mexican locust (Robinia neomexicana) comprised the 
remaining 10 percent basal area. Log density averaged 6.4/ha, 51.0, 1.6, 107.6, 
respectively, for large (>50 cm diameter) and small (<50 cm) ponderosa pine logs; 
large (>15 cm diameter) and small (<15 cm) Gambel oak logs. Snag density averaged 
1.6/ha, 40.3, 7.8, and 216.6, respectively, for large and small ponderosa pine snags; 
large and small Gambel oak snags. 
 
Small Mammal and Habitat Sampling 
I established trapping grids within five 32-ha experimental restoration units. 
Each unit consisted of two stands: one treatment and one control, approximately 
equal in size. Treatment stands were to be harvested in 1999; I sampled all stands 
prior to harvest in July 1998. 
I established a 10 x 10 trapping grid (4 ha grid) centered in each 16-ha stand (n 
= 10 grids). Grid points were placed 20 m apart. At each point on the trapping grid, I 
placed one Sherman live trap (8 x 8 x 23 cm). Traps were baited with a peanut heart 
and seed mix. Traps were set for four to five consecutive nights (until recapture rates 
were >80 percent) and checked daily. Traps were closed during the day to prevent 
capture of diurnal animals and reopened approximately 1 hour before dusk.  
Units 1, 2, and 3 were sampled July 11-15, 1998. Units 4 and 5 were sampled 
July 26-29, 1998. All animals were weighed, measured (total body length, lengths of 
tail, ear, and right hind foot), ear-tagged with a unique number, and released at the 
point of capture.

I obtained vegetation and habitat data for each stand from the Northern Arizona 
University School of Forestry Ecological Restoration Institute. These data were 
collected June through August 1998 for a subset of trap stations (12 to 16 trap 
stations systematically distributed in each grid to equally sample throughout the 
trapping grid). Overstory data (tree density, basal area, canopy cover, snags, logs, 
stumps) were measured on a 0.04 ha plot and shrubs were measured on a 0.01 ha plot 
centered on each trap station location (table 2). Other understory habitat features 
(grasses, forbs, mosses, lichens) were measured by point intercept along a 50-m line 
transect (166 points per transect) and their frequency per trap station calculated (table 
2).

Live trees and snags or partial snags were classified into decay classes. Decay 
class 1 was a live tree with no evidence of dead branches. Decay class 2 was a live 
tree with dead branches (declining), decay class 3 was a recent snag, decay class 4 
was a snag with loose bark, decay class 5 was a snag with no bark remaining. 
 
Statistical Analyses 
Stand-Level Analyses 
I calculated capture rates per stand (number of animals per 100 trap nights [TN]) 
(table 3) for each Peromyscus species. I averaged overstory and understory variables 
for each stand. Habitat variables that were not normally distributed or with unequal 
variance were transformed by taking the square root of the variable or by using 
log10(variable + 1) (Sabin and Stafford 1990). 
I reduced the number of habitat variables for multiple linear regression to adjust 
for small sample sizes. For each mouse species, I developed models using subsets of 
<3 habitat variables. I used Spearman correlations to determine univariate 
relationships between each species of Peromyscus and habitat variables that were 
selected in multivariate models (SAS Institute Inc. 1985) (Spearman correlations: R > 
0.6, P < 0.05 for deer mouse, R > 0.5, P < 0.1 for brush mice, and R > 0.7, P < 0.03 
for pinyon mice). 
I used stepwise linear regression analysis to identify habitat variables that, in 
combination, were associated with small mammal capture rates (Sokal and Rohlf 
1981, SAS Institute Inc. 1985). I used Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) to select 
models with predictive power that used the fewest variables; low AIC values are 
associated with models that give the best fit of data. To select the best model, I 
compared AICd values (relative AIC value for each model, calculated by taking the 
difference between the model with lowest AIC value). If AICd values were < 4, 
models were assumed equally effective in predicting presence of the animal species 
and the most parsimonious model selected (Burnham and Anderson 1998:43-48).

Trap Station Analyses 
I averaged values for each habitat variable by trap station and used these data to 
develop habitat association models. I used logistic regression as a means of selecting 
variables that separated trap stations used by small mammals from unused trap 
stations. I conducted separate analyses for each mouse species (deer mouse, brush 
mouse, pinyon mouse). I used the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test to 
determine whether the distribution of probabilities produced by my model(s) fit the 
logistic probability distribution (SAS Institute, Inc. 1990). 
 
Results 
I captured 270 individuals of 3 species during the trapping period: 135 deer mice 
(50 percent of captures), 74 pinyon mice (27 percent of captures), and 61 brush mice 
(23 percent of captures). Deer mice were more abundant in units 1, 2, and 3. Brush 
mice were most abundant in unit 1. Pinyon mice were most abundant in units 4 and 5 
(table 3). 
 
Stand-Level Analyses 
Models with two regressors were strongest predictors of deer mouse and pinyon 
mouse habitat use based on AICd values.  For brush mouse, there was no difference 
between the 1- and 2-variable models based on AICd values (table 4).  
Large Gambel oak trees and small ponderosa pine snags explained 87 percent of 
the variation in deer mouse abundance (F = 24.3, df = 2, 9, P < 0.0007). Deer mice 
were positively correlated with large Gambel oaks (R = 0.64, P = 0.05) (fig. 1A) and 
negatively correlated with small ponderosa pine snags (R = -0.74, P = 0.01) (fig. 1B).

Basal area of juniper and ponderosa pine trees explained 95 percent of the 
variation in pinyon mouse abundance (F = 67.2, df = 2, 9, P = 0.0001) (table 4). 
Pinyon mice were positively correlated with juniper basal area (R = 0.85, P = 0.002) 
(fig. 1C) and ponderosa pine basal area (R = 0.71, P = 0.02) (fig. 1D). 
Large ponderosa pine stumps explained 37 percent of the variation in brush 
mouse abundance (F = 4.8, df = 1, 9, P = 0.06) (table 4). Brush mice abundance was 
negatively correlated with large ponderosa pine stump density (R = -0.61, P = 0.06) 
(fig. 1E). Lichen cover was not significantly correlated with brush mouse abundance 
(R = 0.15, P = 0.7), and it did little to explain more variation in mouse abundance 
(based on AICd values) when included in the multiple regression model (table 4) (F 
= 5.4, df = 2, 9, P = 0.04). 
 
Trap Station Analyses 
Of 143 trap stations with vegetation data, I captured deer mice at 14 stations, 
pinyon mice at 12 stations, and brush mice at 6 stations. Combining all species, I 
captured mice at 29 of 143 trap stations. 
Trap stations with the highest probability of deer mice capture had higher forb 
cover, higher live tree basal area, and higher densities of small (<15 cm dbh) Gambel 
oak live trees or recent snags (decay class 2 or 3). Pinyon mice were captured at trap 
stations with higher pinyon pine basal area, small (<15 cm dbh) Gambel oak trees, 
and <50 cm diameter ponderosa pine stumps. There was a higher probability of brush 
mouse capture at trap stations with lichen cover, >50 cm dbh ponderosa pines, and 
<15 cm dbh Gambel oak trees or recent snags (decay class 2 or 3).  
 
Discussion 
Habitat Associations of Small Mammals 
The deer mouse is one of the most widespread rodents. In the Southwest, it is 
common in forest types from high elevation spruce/fir (Picea/Abies) forests to 
ponderosa pine forests. Pinyon and brush mice are more selective of habitat. Brush 
mice occur in areas with dense rock and shrub cover, usually in pinyon-juniper, 
riparian, oak, and pine-oak woodlands (Goodwin and Hungerford 1979, Ward and 
Block 1995). Pinyon mice occur in pinyon-juniper and xeric oak woodlands 
(Cranford 1982, Morrison and Hall 1998). 
Ward and Block (1995) described habitat associations of deer mice in ponderosa 
pine/Gambel oak forests of northern Arizona. They found that deer mice used more 
open sites with less shrub and midstory canopy, and smaller densities of Gambel oak. 
They also found deer mice used sites with more slash piles and greater litter depth. 
Goodwin and Hungerford (1979) found that deer mice were correlated with stump 
and log density. They found that mice hid in larger logs or stumps, fallen logs created 
spaces for nesting, and that mice also nested inside bark that had separated from 
stumps and logs. At the stand level, I found deer mice were more abundant in areas 
with higher densities of large Gambel oak. Deer mice were less abundant in stands 
with high densities of small ponderosa pine snags. Small ponderosa pine snags were 
correlated with high densities of live ponderosa pine (R = 0.71, P = 0.02); deer mice 
were therefore less abundant in dense ponderosa pine stands. At the trap station level, 
deer mice were more abundant in areas with high forb cover and live tree basal area.

Gambel oak was an important predictor of deer mouse density. Because deer mice 
are generalists positively correlated with Gambel oak and negatively correlated with 
high densities of ponderosa pine, I hypothesize that deer mice will continue to 
increase in density in treated units for several years following treatment; then 
populations will stabilize.

Ward and Block (1995) found brush mice more abundant in areas with steeper 
slopes, low vegetation cover, sparse tree canopy cover, greater Gambel oak basal 
area, greater Gambel oak tree and shrub density, greater log volume, and less 
ponderosa pine basal area. Goodwin and Hungerford (1979) found high densities of 
brush mice along rocky slopes. These animals used windrowed slash piles. Goodwin 
and Hungerford (1979) also found that brush mice were much less abundant in areas 
of pure ponderosa pine or in mixed pine-juniper forest. I found few correlations 
between brush mice and habitat variables. The regression model I developed for 
brush mice explained less variation than models developed for pinyon and deer mice. 
Brush mice were negatively correlated with large ponderosa pine stump density. 
Brush mice were captured most frequently at Mt. Trumbull in an area with rocky 
basalt-derived soils adjacent to a recent (~6,000 BP) lava flow. I found large 
ponderosa pine stumps were negatively correlated with large ponderosa pine trees (R 
= -0.55, P = 0.10), which may indicate that brush mice were using more open sites. 
Lichen cover (likely an indicator of rock cover), large ponderosa pine and small 
Gambel oak trees were predictors of brush mouse habitat at the trap-station level, 
indicating their use of more open, brushy, rocky habitats. I hypothesize that brush 
mice populations will remain stable or slightly increase following harvest treatment 
since they are less reliant on overstory cover but use shrub and rock cover for habitat. 
Shrubs will likely increase on treated units; rock cover will not change. 
I found no studies that documented habitat use of pinyon mice in ponderosa pine 
forests. I found that pinyon mice were associated with Utah juniper and ponderosa 
pine basal area. Pinyon mice were captured most frequently in stands with high 
densities of small diameter trees. These sites were lower in elevation, with higher 
densities of Utah juniper and pinyon pine. At the trap-station level, pinyon mice were 
captured in areas with high pinyon pine density, and high abundance of small 
Gambel oak trees and small ponderosa pine stumps. Suppression mortality may have 
resulted in high densities of small logs on the forest floor in these stands, but high 
densities of down wood may not necessarily be the cause of pinyon mouse habitat 
use. Other factors, such as the presence of pinyon pine and Utah juniper, may have 
been more important influences in use of habitat by pinyon mice. I hypothesize that 
pinyon mice populations will decline following harvest since pinyon mice are 
associated with high density of small diameter trees. 
I found associations between habitat elements and relative abundance for each 
Peromyscus species; however, in most cases there was little consistency between the 
trap-station analyses and the stand-level comparisons. Multiple linear regression and 
logistic regression examine habitat relationships at different scales, so these results 
are not necessarily surprising (Block and others 1998). 
 
Importance of Dead Wood and Effects of Forest Management 
on Dead Wood 
The models that I developed to predict the presence of Peromyscus species 
included elements of dead wood. However, there were no consistent patterns of dead 
wood use at the two spatial scales (trap-station level and stand-level) I examined. 
Either strong patterns of use of dead wood by these species are different at different 
spatial scales, do not exist, or I could not detect them because of small sample sizes.  
Deer mice are considered habitat generalists, so they may use elements of dead 
wood opportunistically. Brush mice and pinyon mice may be more specialized in

their use of habitat than deer mice, but they also appear able to use a variety of 
habitats. When we released animals, they frequently used stumps or logs as escape 
cover, and I expect they also used these sites as nesting and feeding sites. However, I 
could not provide convincing evidence to link dead wood and Peromyscus species. In 
the Pacific Northwest, Butts and McComb (2000) and Maser and others (1981) 
suggested that other forms of cover (for example, fern cover) might replace logs as 
protective cover. This might also be the case in the Southwest, with animals using 
areas with shrubs or rocky substrates for hiding cover. If mice use logs as movement 
pathways (e.g., we observed pinyon mice running beside or on top of large [>50 cm 
diameter] down wood), logs may not be as readily replaced by other forms of cover. 
Snags have been more studied than down wood. The importance of snags is well 
documented in the Southwest and in other forest ecosystems. Some species (e.g., 
cavity nesters) must use snags or live trees with decay; without them they lack 
breeding sites. Artificial devices (boxes) can be used by some species as substitutes; 
however, these are often costly to set up and maintain. 
How might forest management affect dead wood? Live trees may be retained to 
use as replacement snags and logs in the future. During thinning operations, large 
snags and logs can be protected. Down wood can be added by piling or windrowing 
slash, or by felling trees. However, slash piles break down quickly and their structure 
changes. Slash piles may be useful as cover for only a short period of time, until the 
wood begins to decay and collapses and no longer provides air spaces and movement 
corridors (W. Block, Project Leader, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Flagstaff, 
Arizona, pers. comm.). The effects of prescribed fires on dead wood are less 
predictable. Fire can create dead wood by killing live trees, or it can remove dead 
wood by incinerating snags and logs. Attempts to clear debris around snags and logs 
to protect them during prescribed burning has had mixed success; often a large 
portion of the dead wood is incinerated. Continuation of these studies will help 
clarify the effects of forest management treatments on dead wood and habitat 
relationships of these Peromyscus species.
