Fire history of pinyon–juniper woodlands at upper
ecotones with ponderosa pine forests in Arizona
and New Mexico
David W. Huffman, Peter Z. Fule´ , Kristen M. Pearson, and Joseph E. Crouse
Abstract: We used maps of fire evidence, fire scar dendrochronology, forest age-structure analysis, and landscape analysis
to investigate fire history at pinyon pine (Pinus edulis Engelm.) – juniper (Juniperus osteosperma (Torr.) Little, Juniperus
scopulorum Sarg.) woodland – ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson) forest ecotones in Arizona (Tusayan)
and in New Mexico (Canjilon). Results showed that charred trees were not evenly distributed across vegetative commun-
ities but were significantly (p < 0.001) more abundant than expected in ponderosa pine communities. Composite fire scar
analysis indicated that surface fires occurred in ponderosa pine stands at both sites and burned at intervals of 7.2–11.1 years
(WMPI; Weibull median probability interval). At Tusayan, landscape structure was fine grained, and maximum pinyon
age was >200 years across 80% of the site. At Canjilon, landscape pattern was relatively coarse, and most pinyon patches
were 200–300 years old. Cumulative standing age distributions suggested pinyon–juniper fire rotations of 340 and
290 years at Tusayan and Canjilon, respectively. We concluded the following: (i) surface fires in ponderosa pine stands
did not spread through pinyon–juniper communities at either site, (ii) fire evidence was prevalent across both sites, but old
pinyon trees indicated that no widespread lethal fires had occurred in the last 300–400 years, and (iii) structurally hetero-
geneous landscapes suggested that historical pinyon–juniper fires were of limited extent but lethal in patches.

Introduction
Pinyon–juniper woodlands cover approximately 22.5  106
ha in the western United States and are a dominant vegetation
type on the semiarid landscapes of the American Southwest
(Brown 1994; Powell et al. 1994). Pinyon–juniper woodlands
typically occur at elevations of 1500–2500 m and are highly
variable in species composition and stand structure. For ex-
ample, at upper ecotones where woodlands grade into ponder-
osa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson) forests, pinyon
pine (Pinus edulis Engelm.) becomes more abundant in the
overstory, whereas at lower, drier sites juniper species
(e.g., Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma (Torr.) Little),
oneseed juniper (Juniperus monosperma (Engelm.) Sarg.))

tend to dominate. Variability in vegetation is related to
changes in site characteristics including climate and soils
(West 1999). These differences, in turn, are likely reflected
in fuel structure and potential fire regime changes. Thus,
generalization of historical disturbance regimes for the
pinyon–juniper type as a whole is challenging. In addition,
few data are available that describe historical fire regimes
or structural patterns of pinyon–juniper ecosystems (West
1999; Baker and Shinneman 2004). Romme et al. (2003)
suggested
that
high-frequency,
low-severity
fires
most
likely maintain open stand conditions on juniper savannas
or in pinyon–juniper communities at ecotones with other
frequent fire types like ponderosa pine forests. In contrast,
it is thought that fire occurs infrequently in persistent
woodlands found on less productive, rocky sites with less
abundant herbaceous plant cover, or sites where topo-
graphic influences break fuel continuity (Tausch and West
1988; Floyd et al. 2000). Under these conditions, infre-
quent severe fires would result in canopy openings of vari-
ous sizes. Indeed, Floyd et al. (2004) reported extents of
historical stand-replacing fires >1000 ha at Mesa Verde
National Park in Colorado.
Methodological
limitations
of
previous
studies
have
contributed
to
the
uncertainty
surrounding
historical
pinyon–juniper fire regimes. For example, investigations
based
solely
on
fire-scarred
trees
can
be
misleading.
Although more research is needed to identify conditions
that lead to scarring of pinyon and juniper trees (Baker and
Shinneman 2004), others have suggested that pinyon and
some juniper species are typically killed by low-intensity
fire and do not record surface fires well (West 1999). Using
dendrochronological techniques to precisely determine fire
years is difficult even if juniper scars are located, and with-
out crossdating scars cannot be used in composite fire inter-
val analysis. Further, decades to hundreds of years may be
required for some pinyon–juniper systems to fully recover
after severe disturbance (Arnold et al. 1964; Erdman 1970).
For this reason, and because reburning can be difficult to
determine, natural fire rotation estimates based on stand-
structure analysis can be imprecise. To reduce these limita-
tions and gain greater insight into historical patterns, studies
employing multiple lines of evidence are recommended
(Egan and Howell 2001; Baker and Shinneman 2004).
Historical reference condition information aides in the de-
sign of ecosystem management strategies meant to emulate
natural ranges of ecological variability (Kaufmann et al.
1994). For pinyon–juniper ecosystems of the Southwest,
variability in historical fire regimes can lead to widely
divergent management actions. For example, on sites where
high-frequency, low-severity surface fire prevailed, manage-
ment goals may be to maintain or restore open structural con-
ditions and low-intensity fire (Jacobs and Gatewood 1999).
In contrast, management of ecosystems with stand-replacing
fire regimes may require maintenance of dense, older stand
conditions as well as creation of large open patches that
mimic fire-created mosaics.
In this study, our goal was to use multiple lines of evi-
dence and intensive sampling to increase basic understand-
ing of historical fire regimes of pinyon–juniper ecosystems
at ecotonal boundaries with ponderosa pine forests in the
Southwest. We
were
interested
in historical
fire
type
(e.g., nonlethal surface fire versus stand-replacing fire) as
well as spatial patterns of forest structure that may have
resulted from past fire events. We were particularly inter-
ested in testing the hypothesis that although surface fires
were uncommon in pinyon–juniper woodlands of the west-
ern United States (Baker and Shinneman 2004), such fires
may have occurred in upper ecotonal environments where
pinyon–juniper communities are found adjacent to frequent-
fire types such as ponderosa pine forests (Romme et al.
2003). We expected that nonlethal surface fires would leave
evidence such as fire scars on trees (older live and dead
structures). In contrast, if historical fires were mainly infre-
quent stand-replacing fires (e.g., Floyd et al. 2004), we ex-
pected that this would be apparent in discrete patches of
charred snags and logs as well as relatively large areas
where the ages of the oldest trees are similar. We inten-
sively sampled ecotonal sites in northern Arizona and New
Mexico and used fire scar dendrochronology, forest age-
structure analysis, and landscape analysis to determine
which of the two models of historical fire more closely
applied.
By
restricting
our
study
to
pinyon–juniper
woodland – ponderosa pine forest ecotones, we intended to
provide focused information concerning a portion of the
natural range of variability for southwestern pinyon–juniper
ecosystems.
Methods
Study sites
We selected two sites that represented typical transition
habitat between pinyon – juniper woodlands and ponderosa
pine forests of Arizona and New Mexico. One site was lo-
cated on the Tusayan Ranger District of the Kaibab National
Forest (hereafter, ‘‘Tusayan’’), and a second site was on the
Canjilon Ranger District on the Carson National Forest in
New Mexico (hereafter ‘‘Canjilon’’). The Tusayan site (lat.
36801’24@N, long. 112811’55@W) was located immediately
south of Grand Canyon National Park and comprised ap-
proximately 770 ha. The Canjilon site (lat. 32824’31@N,
long. 106831’31@W) was approximately 61 km northwest of
Espanola, New Mexico on La Mesa de Las Viejas and was
409 ha in size. Although the two sites were not precisely sim-
ilar in terms of climate, soils, and management history, we
felt they were representative of upper ecotone sites with sedi-
mentary soils and mostly low-shrub understory vegetation.
Tusayan
The Tusayan site ranges 2005–2073 m in elevation
with topography of relatively flat uplands dissected by
shallow
canyon
draws.
Annual
precipitation
averages
430 mm and occurs bimodally, falling mainly as snow
in winter (December–March) and rain in summer (July–
September) (Western Regional Climate Center 2006). An-
nual maximum and minimum temperatures average 17
and
0
8C,
respectively.
Terrestrial
Ecosystem
Survey
(TES) descriptions (USDA Forest Service 1991) indicate
that soils at the site are mainly typic eutroboralfs, lithic
haploborolls, and typic haplustalfs formed in residuum
from limestone and sandstone parent material. Overstory
tree species are primarily pinyon pine, Utah juniper, pon-
derosa pine, and Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.).

Pinyon–juniper woodlands are present on the upland sites
(approximately 80% of the total area), and ponderosa pine
forests occupy the canyon draws as well as locations along
the western and eastern edges of the study area (approxi-
mately 20% of the area). Florist variability is likely a re-
sult of microclimate and soil differences (USDA Forest
Service 1991). Understory shrubs present included big
sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.), Mexican cliffrose
(Purshia mexicana (D. Don) Henrickson), and Apache
plume (Fallugia paradoxa (D. Don) Endl. ex Torr.).
Resource use and management activities over the last
130 years at the Tusayan site have varied. Intensive grazing
by domestic livestock in the late 1800s and early 1900s is
known to have occurred throughout the area (Miller 1921;
Olberding et al. 2005). No livestock have grazed the site
since 1996, although severe overstocking had been noted
for several decades prior to this time (D. Brewer, US Forest
Service, personal communication). Ponderosa pine stumps
and a few old log decks observed at the site indicate there
was a timber harvest that probably occurred around 1930,
when logging railroads reached the area (Putt 1995). Fuel-
wood harvesting of dead and down pinyon and juniper trees
has been an on-going yet minor use of the site over the last
10–20 years. Small wildfires have occurred on the site in the
last 35 years (see Results), and a prescribed fire intended to
reduce surface fuels 30%–70% was implemented in 1993
across approximately half the study area. Based on our ob-
servations, this burn mainly consumed dead and downed
fuels but only minimally affected tree density.
Canjilon
Similar to the Tusayan site, vegetation at the Canjilon site
is transitional between ponderosa pine forests and pinyon–
juniper woodlands. Elevation ranges from 2347 m along the
eastern study site boundary to 2438 m at the southwestern
edge. The eastern boundary is the abrupt edge of La Mesa
de Las Viejas. Annual precipitation averages about 388 mm
with a pronounced peak of occurrence July–September
(Western Regional Climate Center 2006). Annual maximum
and minimum temperatures average 17 and –2.7 8C, respec-
tively. TES descriptions (USDA Forest Service 1987) indi-
cate
that
soils
are
mainly
typic
ustochrepts,
typic
eutroboralfs, and typic haplustalfs derived from various
parent materials including shale. Overstory tree composition
is dominated by pinyon pine and Rocky Mountain juniper
(Juniperus scopulorum Sarg.), particularly along the eastern
boundary. Ponderosa pine and Gambel oak communities
dominate the lower northwestern edge as well as an area
along the southern boundary. Understory shrub communities
are made up of big sagebrush, mountain mahogany (Cerco-
carpus montanus Raf.), and rubber rabbitbrush (Ericameria
nauseosa (Pallas ex Pursh) Nesom & Baird). Historical land
use at the Canjilon site is not well known, although Native
American and Hispanic activities are likely to have influ-
enced woodland structure and dynamics to some extent be-
fore the late 19th century (Allen 2002). More recently
(ca. 1951), efforts were made to rehabilitate overgrazed
land on La Mesa de Las Viejas (Scurlock 1998).
Charred tree evidence and fire scar sampling
To identify areas of fire activity, we mapped charred tree
structures (hereafter called ‘‘charred trees’’) at each site us-
ing 100 m wide belt transects. At the Tusayan site, the abun-
dance of charred structures within the 1993 prescribed fire
area forced us to limit our surveys to outside the boundary
of the burn. We used transects to systematically survey
50% of the total area (i.e., transects were spaced 100 m
apart) outside the burn, and spatial coordinates were re-
corded for each charred tree found within the belts. At the
Canjilon site, we conducted a complete census (100% of
the study area) of charred trees using these transects.
In addition to mapping charred trees, we made use of the
transects to search for fire-scarred trees. Spatial coordinates,
species, diameter, condition, and number of apparent fire
scars were recorded for each scarred tree found within the
belts. We used these data to help target scarred trees for
fire scar collection. To gain as large a sample size as possi-
ble, we also searched areas not sampled by transects (i.e.,
within the 1993 prescribed burn and intertransect areas at
Tusayan). Live and dead trees with multiple lesions and
visible charring were targeted, and partial cross-sections
were collected using chainsaws. For each sample collected,
data regarding spatial location, slope and aspect of the
microsite, species, condition, location of the sample, and
number of visible scars were recorded. Samples were
brought back to the laboratory for fire interval analysis
(Arno and Sneck 1977). In the laboratory, samples were
glued to plywood mounts and sanded with fine-grit sand-
paper until ring structure was clearly visible under magnifi-
cation. We collected 120 and 66 partial cross-sections at the
Tusayan and Canjilon sites, respectively (Table 1).
Sampling woodland structure
To examine woodland structural characteristics, we sys-
tematically established sample plots on 200 m  200 m
grids at both sites. Sample plots were circular and 0.04 ha
(11.28 m radius) in size. In total, we established 182 and
106 plots at Tusayan and Canjilon, respectively. On all
plots, live and dead pinyon and juniper trees (‡1.37 m in
height) were measured for diameter at root collar (DRC,
measured at ground level) and examined for charcoal and
(or) fire scars. Diameter of each stem was measured for
multiple-stemmed trees. Live ponderosa pine and Gambel
oak trees were measured for diameter at breast height
(DBH, measured at 1.37 m above ground), whereas dead
trees of these species were measured at 40 cm above root
collar (DSH, diameter at stump height). At both sites, incre-
ment cores were collected from pinyon trees at DSH to de-
termine their ages. At Tusayan, cores were collected from
all trees greater than 25 cm DRC and from a 20% random
sample of smaller trees on 48 randomly selected plots. At
Canjilon, cores were collected from a 20% random sample
of all live trees on plots.
Modern fire records
Fire records were collected from US Forest Service ar-
chives to describe characteristics of modern fires and make
comparisons with historical evidence. Records available
were in both electronic (geographical information system)
and paper form, and data collected included location, date,
size class, cause, and fire name. For Tusayan, records from
as early as circa 1940 were available. For Canjilon, the ear-

liest fire records were from circa 1970. These data served as
points of reference for interpreting other evidence such as
charred trees and fire scars.
Analysis
Charred tree distribution
We analyzed spatial patterns of charred trees using c2
goodness-of-fit tests (Devore and Peck 1986). At each site,
expected abundance for an even distribution of charred trees
across TES units was tested against observed amounts. Stat-
istically significant differences were indicated when c2 ex-
ceeded upper-tail critical values (significance level £0.05).
Fire intervals
To determine surface fire frequency, we conducted a
composite fire interval analysis as described by Arno and
Sneck (1977). Fire scars on partial cross-section samples
were crossdated using local master chronologies (Stokes
and Smiley 1996). Accuracy of crossdating was verified us-
ing the computer software COFECHA (Grissino-Mayer
2001). Composite fire return intervals were determined for
the set of all scars as well as for only the fire years that
occurred on 10% or more of the samples. The 10% filter
corresponds with increasing size and (or) intensity of fires,
removing the fire dates represented by only one or a few
samples (Swetnam and Baisan 1996). Fire interval analysis
started from the earliest fire date observed on our samples.
We used FHX2 software (Grissino-Mayer 1995) to generate
Weibull median probability intervals (WMPI), and mean fire
interval (MFI) statistics for the presettlement periods (before
1887 and 1890 for Tusayan and Canjilon, respectively). The
filtered analyses resulted in WMPI that were nearly identical
to those of unfiltered analyses. We therefore only report fire
return interval statistics from the set of all crossdated fire
scars.
We also determined point fire intervals for samples show-
ing two or more fire scars (Brown et al. 2001). Mean point
fire intervals (MPFI) were calculated as the average of the
number of tree rings present between scars on individual
samples. MPFI values were determined for crossdated pon-
derosa pine and pinyon fire scars. Ring counts were used to
determine MPFI values for pinyon and juniper fire scars that
could not be reliably crossdated. MPFI were placed into
broad
interval
classes
(1–25,
26–100,
101–300,
and >300 years) by species to account for errors related to
false and missing rings. Trends were investigated using fre-
quency histograms.
Structural conditions
Species importance values were determined for overstory
trees on plots as described by Husch et al. (2003). Species
importance was calculated as the relative proportion of den-
sity (TPH, trees per hectare) plus the relative proportion of
basal area (BA) represented by each species. Thus, an im-
portance value of 200 would indicate complete dominance
by a given species on a plot (i.e., 100% of the total TPH +
100% of the total BA).
Similar to fire scar samples, increment cores from pinyon
trees were crossdated using standard dendrochronology tech-
niques (Stokes and Smiley 1996). We used crossdated cores
(N = 363 and 215 for Tusayan and Carson, respectively) to
develop diameter–age relationships and create stand age
maps. We focused on pinyon pine for the following reasons:
(i) its sample size was greater than juniper species; (ii) it
was well distributed across the study sites; and (iii) its cores
could be crossdated. In addition, pinyon is relatively intoler-
ant of fire, so the oldest pinyon trees in an area are likely to
represent the minimum time since the last lethal fire (West
1999). Tree age–diameter relationships were analyzed using
simple linear regression (a = 0.05) (Fig. 1). Equations de-
rived from these analyses were then used to estimate ages
of trees for which no cores were collected. We considered
pinyon ages predicted in this way to be underestimates of
true tree age, since increment cores were collected at 40 cm
above the ground. We used maximum pinyon age on plots
to create stand maps (see GIS analysis) and assess landscape
structural patterns that may have arisen from historical wild-
fires.
To evaluate stand-replacing fire cycles for pinyon–juniper
communities at the sites, we selected plots where ponderosa
pine importance was less than 50 (i.e., only plots where
pinyon and juniper trees dominated). We tested the fit of
maximum pinyon age data from these plots to negative
exponential and Weibull models as described by Johnson
and Gutsell (1994). When data did not significantly fit either

model, we estimated fire rotation by examining cumula-
tive plot age distributions. We followed the example of
Floyd et al. (2004) and interpreted fire rotation as the
number of years encompassed by the standing pinyon
ages and thus the time over which the entire area may
have burned (i.e., fire cycle).
This approach
assumes
that fire is an episodic stand-initiating process, although
other factors such as insects and drought also are likely
to
cause
patch-scale
mortality
(Baker
and
Shinneman
2004). It should be noted that data resolution is likely
to affect model fit. We used 10, 50-year age classes in
these
analyses
for
reasons
described
below
(see
GIS
analysis).
GIS analysis
To examine spatial patterns of age structure and fire
evidence, we used the Spatial Analyst extension for Arc-
View GIS to construct surface maps of maximum pinyon
age on plots (McCoy and Johnston 2001). Cell values be-
tween plots were estimated using inverse distance weighted
(IDW)
interpolation.
Because
our
sample
plots
were
0.04 ha in size and spaced on a regular 200 m grid across
the study sites, we used a 20 m cell size and a 250 m
fixed radius cell neighborhood as interpolation parameters.
Cells of interpolated surfaces were reclassified into 50-year
age classes to account for tree age errors and to identify
broad cohorts that may have established after disturbance
such as fire. We analyzed landscape characteristics of the
maps using the FRAGSTATS extension of ArcView de-
signed for raster GIS coverages (McGarigal and Marks
1995). We summarized the following landscape metrics:
total class area, number of patches per class, and mean
patch size. Additionally, we overlaid locations of fire-
charred tree structures and partial cross-section samples on
these maps to provide greater insight into historical fire
patterns.
Results
Charred trees and fire scar evidence
Charred tree structures were found across the Tusayan site
near older as well as younger stands (Fig. 2). c2 tests indi-
cated significantly (P < 0.001) different abundances of
charred trees than expected for an even distribution among
TES mapping units (Table 2). Pinyon–juniper units had
36% fewer charred trees than expected, whereas two of
three ponderosa pine units showed almost twice as many as
expected. Charred trees were primarily found as isolated
individuals; we did not find extensive cohorts of standing
dead (or downed) trees that indicated large lethal fire events.
At Tusayan, we were able to crossdate 36% (N = 43) of
the collected fire scar samples. Of the crossdated samples,
86% were from ponderosa pine and 14% were from pinyon
pine. All crossdated fire scars were collected within TES
units dominated by ponderosa pine, thus composite fire
intervals represented approximately 235 ha, or 30% of the
total study site area (Table 2). On these microsites, the high-
est number of recorded presettlement (i.e., before 1887) fires
occurred in the 1600s. Although scars indicated numerous
fires throughout the 1600s and 1800s, a gap in the fire
record between 1680 and 1805 was observed. Twelve post-
settlement fires (i.e., 1887–2004) were noted. Based on all
crossdated scars, presettlement MFI was 10.9 years, and
WMPI was 7.2 years (range = 1–64 years) (Fig. 3).
We were not able to crossdate juniper (J. osteosperma)
wood, although we did collect six scarred samples. Four jun-
iper trees that showed scars from repeated nonlethal fire were
located along the edges of ponderosa pine stands; no such
samples were found on upland microsites within the pinyon–
juniper woodlands. Presettlement mean point fire intervals
(MPFI)
on
all
ponderosa
and
pinyon
pine
trees
were £100 years; 36% of ponderosa MPFI and 50% of pinyon
MPFI values were £25 years. MPFI values for juniper were
all ‡26 years, but half of these were ‡100 years (Fig. 4).
Similar to Tusayan, charred trees at Canjilon were found
throughout the site, although significantly (P < 0.001) more
charred trees than expected were found within ponderosa
pine dominated TES units (Table 2). A group of charred
trees was found on the eastern edge of the study site near
the rim of Mesa de Las Viejas (Fig. 2).
At Canjilon, we were able to crossdate 39% (N = 24) of
the collected fire scar samples (Table 1). Of the crossdated
samples, 58% were from ponderosa pine, 37% were pinyon
pine, and one juniper (J. scopulorum) sample was crossdated
(Table 1). Although less distinct than at Tusayan, fire scars
at Canjilon were found mainly on microsites dominated by
ponderosa pine. Composite fire intervals at Canjilon repre-
sented approximately 99 ha, or 24% of the total study site
area (Table 2). No fire-scarred trees were found within the
pinyon–juniper woodlands occupying the eastern portion of
the study site (Fig. 2). The greatest number of presettlement
(i.e., before 1890) surface fires occurred in the 1600s (6 fire
years). Similar to Tusayan, data showed two noticeable gaps
in the fire record; one was from 1665 to 1755, and the other
was from 1805 to 1875. Eight fire years were found for the
postsettlement period (i.e., 1890–2005). For all crossdated
scars, presettlement MFI at Canjilon was 22.5 years, and
WMPI was 11.1 years (range 1–94 years) (Fig. 3).

A limited number (N = 5) of junipers were found with
multiple fire scars. The vast majority (86%) of ponderosa
pine samples showed MPFI values £100 years. All pinyon
pine MPFI values were ‡26 years, but 33% of these
were ‡101 years. In contrast, 60% of juniper MPFI values
were ‡100 years (Fig. 4).
Stand ages and fire rotation
Approximately 80% of the Tusayan landscape was made
up of patches (i.e., cells with similar interpolated values)
where the oldest pinyon trees were ‡200 years old (Fig. 2;
Table 3). The 250- to 300-year class made up the largest
proportion (36%) of the study area and had the largest
mean patch size (30 ha) (Table 3). Mean patch sizes of all
other age classes were <5 ha except for the 200- to 250-
year
class
(13
ha).
Pinyon
stands
with
maximum
age £150 years were generally found on mixed ponderosa
pine – pinyon–juniper microsites (i.e., ponderosa pine im-
portance values were ‡50).
Standing age class distribution for pinyon- and juniper-
dominated plots (i.e., ponderosa importance <50) at Tu-
sayan did not significantly fit a negative exponential or
Weibull model. Analysis of the cumulative plot age distri-
bution suggested that fire rotation was 340 years during the
period 480–140 years before our sampling date (1524–1864)
(Fig. 5). On pinyon- and juniper-dominated plots, maximum
pinyon age was >140 years, although it was not clear
whether this indicated a recent shift in fire frequency.
Canjilon showed a narrower range of patch ages and gen-
erally greater mean patch size than Tusayan (Table 3). The
oldest patches (>250 years) were located at the upper eleva-
tions, while young patches were near a prominent big sage-
brush meadow in the center of the study area (Fig. 2).
Similar to Tusayan data, age distribution for pinyon- and
juniper-dominated (i.e., ponderosa importance <50) plots at
Canjilon did not significantly fit a negative exponential or
Weibull model. Analysis of the cumulative plot age distribu-
tion indicated a fire rotation of 290 years during the period
420–130
years
before
our
sampling
date
(1585–1875)
(Fig. 5).
Modern fires
US Forest Service records indicated 16 fires at Tusayan
from 1970 to 2004. Twelve of the fires were caused by
lightning, and the rest were caused by human activity. Nine
fires had occurred early to mid summer, and the rest were in
late season. No fires were greater than 4 ha in size, and most
(94%) were less than 0.25 acre (1 acre = 0.4047 ha). Canji-
lon records indicated four fires occurring from 1975 until
2005. All fires at Canjilon were caused by lightning, and
three occurred in early summer. None of the fires were
greater than 0.25 acre in size.
Discussion
Historical surface fires in ponderosa pine stands
Fire scars indicated that surface fires recurred at intervals
of 7.2–7.4 years (WMPI) (MFI, 10.9–11.6 years) and 11.1
(WMPI) (MFI, 22.5 years) in the ponderosa pine forest com-
munities at Tusayan and Canjilon, respectively. These fre-
quencies are somewhat longer than those reported for
surface fire regimes in ponderosa pine forests at other sites
in northern Arizona (Swetnam and Baisan 1996; Fule´ et al.
2003). In our study, relatively long fire-free gaps were en-
countered at both sites, which certainly increased fire return
interval estimates. Shorter gaps, especially associated with
the transition from the late 18th to early 19th centuries have
been reported elsewhere in southwestern North America
(e.g., Stephens et al. 2003), and there is some evidence of
inter-hemispheric links between altered fire frequencies in
North and South American forests (Kitzberger et al. 2001,
2007). However, the gaps we observed in the fire record are
not linked in time to periods identified by other researchers.
Instead, we suspect that they represent the relatively limited
availability of fire-scarred ponderosa pines at the ecotone.
Similar WMPI values between the set of all scars and analy-
sis of only the fire years that occurred on 10% or more of
the samples provided further support for this conclusion.
Several postsettlement fires were noted in fire scars from
both sites. These were likely the result of human activities
including prescribed burning (H. McRae, US Forest Service,
personal communication). Because of gaps in the fire scar

records and the occurrence and postsettlement fires at both
sites, we could not clearly determine whether fire regimes
had substantially changed between pre- and post-settlement
periods.
At Tusayan, fire scars were encountered in lowland ar-
royos and canyons occupied by ponderosa pine stands. At
Canjilon, fire scars were found primarily within the pon-
derosa pine stands along the western portion of the study

site. No scars were found at the lower elevations or within
the pinyon- and juniper-dominated areas of the eastern por-
tion of the Canjilon site. Spatial location and species com-
position of fire scar samples suggested that historical fires
did
not
spread
far
from
ponderosa
pine
stands
into
pinyon–juniper woodlands at either site. Thus, composite
intervals probably did not reflect pinyon–juniper fire fre-
quencies. This conclusion was also supported by lower
than expected numbers of charred trees in pinyon–juniper
communities as well as a limited number of juniper scars;
these were found only at the edges of ponderosa pine com-
munities at Tusayan. Mean point fire intervals (MPFI) of
scarred juniper, although determined from ring counts, ap-
peared longer than those of pinyon and ponderosa. Broad
MPFI classes were used to make up for errors due to false
and (or) missing rings, and these samples were of limited
value for reconstructing precise fire intervals. They did,
however, demonstrate that multiple nonlethal surface fires
may be recorded by these species (J. osteosperma and
J. scopulorum) and are one line of evidence often dis-
counted in studies of historical fire patterns in these eco-
systems (but see Young and Evans 1981). Brown et al.
(2001) reported MPFI ranging 10–49 years for 19 fire
years recorded on seven fire-scarred pinyon trees in the
Sacramento Mountains of New Mexico. The possibility of
fire scar occurrence on pinyon and juniper trees suggests
that fire frequency estimates based on samples from fire-
resistant species should be viewed cautiously. For example,
previous studies have interpreted fire intervals of 7–20 years
for pinyon–juniper woodlands based on analysis of scars
collected from ponderosa pine trees (Miller and Rose
1999; Perryman and Laycock 2000). Perhaps in many
cases, scarcity of fire scars in pinyon–juniper communities
indicates infrequent, lethal fire regimes (Floyd et al. 2004).
At our sites, we found a lack of support for the hypothesis
that surface fires were common in pinyon–juniper wood-
lands adjacent to ponderosa pine forests (Romme et al.
2003). We were not able to investigate factors related to
the apparent abrupt differences in fire regimes between the
ponderosa pine and pinyon–juniper communities. Micro-
climate and soil differences, and their effects on vegetation
cover and fuel characteristics, were undoubtedly important
in determining the patterns we observed (Romme et al.
2003).
Heterogeneity of stand ages
Stand age maps, patch analysis, and plot age class distri-
butions indicated that widespread lethal fires were not an as-
pect of the pinyon–juniper fire regime at either site for at
least 400 years. Rather, we found converging lines of evi-
dence to suggest that relatively small patch-scale events
were historically important. Patches with similar maximum
pinyon ages were generally small, and a broad range of
stand age classes were found. At Canjilon, small lethal fires
may have occurred near the eastern boundary, where we
found concentrated numbers of charred trees, and pinyon
stands were relatively young (Fig. 2). Pinyon trees at both
sites were up to ~450 years old. Floyd et al. (2008) reported
similar fine-grained landscape patterns in pinyon–juniper
woodlands of southern Utah, with trees up to 600 years old
interspersed with younger stands <10 ha in size. These pat-
terns were attributed to combined factors of soil texture,
topography, and fire occurrence (Floyd et al. 2008). At our
sites, scattered charred trees indicated that fire ignitions
were not historically limiting but did not lead to widespread
tree mortality. In contrast, Brown et al. (2001) concluded
that severe fire within the last century produced numerous
dead and downed trees, stands of mainly young trees, and
an absence of old trees. Similarly, Arnold et al. (1964) de-
scribed a large area with numerous charred juniper snags
near Supai, Arizona (west of our Tusayan study site). It
should be noted that charred structures do not necessarily in-
dicate tree mortality per se. Charred trees could result from
snags that have burned (i.e., trees that are dead before the
fire occurs). In fact, widespread mortality events related to
drought and insect outbreaks have occurred at various south-
western sites the past century (Betancourt et al. 1993;
Breshears 2005).
Large infrequent crownfires are thought to represent natu-
ral fire regimes of pinyon–juniper woodlands in some parts
of the Southwest (Arnold et al. 1964; Baker and Shinneman
2004). For example, Floyd et al. (2000) estimated pinyon–
juniper and shrubland fire rotations were *400 years at
Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado. In another study at
Mesa Verde, Floyd et al. (2004) described stand-replacing

(PIPO), and Rocky Mountain juniper (JUSC).

fires that burned areas of up to 3461 ha in the early 1800s.
In these studies, Floyd et al. (2000, 2004) used multiple
lines of evidence, including delineation of historic fire
perimeters, stand age analysis, and Gambel oak sprout
dendrochronology, to interpret fire history. In our study, we
used cumulative pinyon age class distributions to estimated
fire rotations. Similar to the methods of Floyd et al. (2004),
we calculated fire rotation as the time required to burn our
sites, as indicated by the number of years encompassed by
standing cohorts. Our estimates of fire rotation at Tusayan
and Canjilon were 340 and 290 years, respectively. From
this, and evidence described above, we concluded that infre-
quent fire cycles were made up of fires of limited extent.
Our fire rotation estimates were considerably lower than
those reported by Floyd et al. (2000, 2004). Further, we
were not able to identify areas that may have reburned,
which would have resulted in even lower fire rotation esti-
mates.
Although this study increased our understanding of histor-
ical fire patterns in ecotonal pinyon–juniper woodlands, we
identified a number of limitations. For example, we were
not able to clearly determine whether historical fire regime
characteristics had changed since Euro-American settlement,
although fire suppression is thought to have had minimal ef-
fects on infrequent fire types (Romme et al. 2003). In addi-
tion, it was clear that stand age estimated minimum time
since lethal fire; however, pinyon establishment after severe
fires in these systems can require decades (Arnold et al.
1964; Erdman 1970). Further, we could not be sure that
other mortality factors such as drought and insects were not
responsible for initiating stands. Finally, we were not able to
determine several other important fire regime characteristics
(e.g., fire severity, fire intensity), and links between fire oc-
currence and climate were not investigated.

Implications
Fire
undoubtedly
influenced
historical
structure
and
function of the pinyon–juniper ecosystems at our study sites.
However,
there
is
still
great
uncertainty
surrounding
historical processes across the range of this type, and fire re-
gimes appear to be highly variable (West 1999; Baker and
Shinneman 2004). In this study, we used multiple lines of
evidence and intensive sampling to elucidate fire and land-
scape patterns at two sites representing pinyon–juniper
communities at upper ecotones with ponderosa pine for-
ests. Such ecotones are common on landscapes of the
Southwest and thus account for a meaningful fraction of
the variability in this region’s pinyon–juniper ecosystems.
More work is needed at similar sites to fully describe fire
regimes of these complex environments. Such information
can help land managers to develop sound, science-based
management
strategies
for
conservation
and
ecosystem
management.
