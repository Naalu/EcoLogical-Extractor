Abstract.
We analyzed one of the longest-term ecological data sets to evaluate how forest
overstory structure is related to herbaceous understory plant strategies in a ponderosa pine
forest. Eighty-two permanent 1-m2 chart quadrats that were established as early as 1912 were
remeasured in 2007. We reconstructed historical forest structure using dendrochronological
techniques. Ponderosa pine basal area increased from an average of 4 m2/ha in the early 1900s
to 29 m2/ha in 2007. Understory plant foliar cover declined by 21%, species richness declined
by two species per square meter, and functional diversity also declined. The relative cover of
C4 graminoids decreased by 18% and C3 graminoids increased by 19%. Herbaceous plant
species with low leaf and ﬁne root nitrogen concentrations, low speciﬁc leaf area, high leaf
dry matter content, large seed mass, low speciﬁc root length, short maximum height, and
early ﬂowering date increased in relative abundance in sites where pine basal area increased
the most. Overall, we observed a long-term shift in composition toward more conservative
shade- and stress-tolerant herbaceous species. Our analysis of temporal changes in plant
strategies provides a general framework for evaluating compositional and functional changes
in terrestrial plant communities.

INTRODUCTION
Plant strategies have developed over evolutionary
time scales (e.g., millennia) due to selection on growth,
survival, and reproduction in resource-limited environ-
ments (Grime 1979). Changes in environmental condi-
tions and resource availability over ecological time
scales (e.g., decades) could cause shifts in plant
community composition because plants with traits that
are best adapted to the new environment may rise to
dominance (Keddy 1992). Few studies have documented
shifts in functional strategies over time because complete
species–trait matrices and long-term data sets are scarce.
In the southwestern United States, tree densities in
ponderosa pine forests have increased signiﬁcantly since
Euroamerican settlement in the late 1800s due to land-
use changes including grazing, logging, and ﬁre sup-
pression, and also due to climatic events favorable to
natural pine regeneration (Moore et al. 1999). In this
paper, we use a set of long-term (;100 years) permanent
vegetation plots to determine if changes in forest stand
density were associated with shifts in herbaceous
understory community structure and plant strategies.
In prior work, we found that three orthogonal strategy
axes, representing Westoby’s (1998) ‘‘leaf–height–seed’’
model of plant strategies, captures the majority of
functional variation in a ponderosa pine forest under-
story ﬂora (Laughlin et al. 2010). The ﬁrst strategy axis
represents variation along the ‘‘leaf economics spec-
trum’’ (Wright et al. 2004) and is indicative of a species’
ability to rapidly photosynthesize and respond to
opportunities for rapid growth (Reich et al. 1997). The
second strategy axis represents variation in seed mass,
which reﬂects variation in dispersal capability and ability
to establish in deep shade (Grime and Jeffrey 1965,
Westoby et al. 1996). The third strategy axis represents
variation in plant height, which reﬂects variation in
ability to acquire light (Keddy and Shipley 1989).
This study builds on our prior work by addressing
how these functional strategies may have responded to
long-term changes in forest structure. The environmental
conditions associated with dense ponderosa pine stands,
such as shade, deep litter horizons, low soil moisture and
temperature, and low available nutrients (Kaye and Hart
1998) make these environments physiologically stressful
(Grime 1979). We predicted that increases in pine
canopy cover over the last century would shift under-
story communities toward dominance by conservative
graminoids and forbs, which exhibit multiple traits that
confer long-term maintenance of acquired resources
(Reich et al. 2003). Therefore, we predicted that
increasing pine densities would be associated with (1)
decreased herbaceous speciﬁc leaf area (SLA) and tissue
nutrient concentrations reﬂecting declines along the leaf

METHODS
Chart quadrats
The ponderosa pine forest ecosystem covers approx-
imately 3.5 million ha of land across uplands in the
southwestern United States. Our study was conducted
on a ;12 000 ha landscape on the Coconino National
Forest in northern Arizona between the elevations of
2000–2500 m on relatively ﬂat sites. Ponderosa pine is
the dominant tree species and forms extensive pure
stands, but sometimes occurs with Gambel oak (Quercus
gambelii Nutt.). Quadrats were located within a range of
soil types developed in basalt, limestone, and sandstone
parent materials. Grazing by native ungulates and
domestic livestock still occurs across the study area,
though grazing intensity has declined considerably over
time (Bakker and Moore 2007). The mean annual
precipitation of Flagstaff, Arizona is 56 cm and the
mean annual temperature is 7.78C.
In 1905, Frederic Clements suggested that plant
communities be studied using ﬁne-grained 1-m2 maps
called ‘‘chart quadrats’’ that show the location and basal
area of individual plants (Clements 1905). At least 98
chart quadrats were established in northern Arizona
between 1912 and 1938. Raw data were preserved in the
Fort Valley Experimental Forest Archives (U.S. Forest
Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Flagstaff,
Arizona, USA). We found the exact location of 82 chart
quadrats because their corners were permanently
marked with angle iron or galvanized steel pipe and a
metal tag (Appendix A).
Historically, professional botanists compiled a com-
plete species list and mapped the basal cover (i.e., area of
ground occupied by a plant) of every plant on each
quadrat. Graminoids with measurable basal area were
mapped as polygons, and other species were mapped as
points. Shrubs were recorded, but were too sparse to
include in this analysis. We replicated the historical
measurements and digitized historical and recent chart
quadrat maps in a geographical information system
(ArcView GIS version 3.3; ESRI, Redlands, California,
USA) to facilitate the calculation of basal cover of each
species on each plot (Appendix A). We lumped some
taxa to higher taxonomic levels due to observer errors,
uncertain identiﬁcation of some species in vegetative
state, and ambiguity of common names used in
historical sampling (Appendix B).
Functional traits
We measured a core set of functional traits on all
plant species detected on these plots. We measured
speciﬁc leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content
(LDMC), leaf nitrogen concentration ([N]), ﬁne root
[N], seed mass, speciﬁc root length (SRL), canopy
height, and mean Julian ﬂowering date. Trait measure-
ment methodology is described in Laughlin et al. (2010).
We calculated two functional diversity indices. First,
FDpg (Petchy and Gaston 2002) is the sum of the branch
lengths of a functional trait dendrogram and does not
take into account the relative abundances of the species.
Second, FDrao (Botta-Duka´ t 2005), also known as
‘‘Rao’s quadratic entropy,’’ uses a distance matrix
(calculated from a species–trait matrix) and weights
the index by the relative abundance of the species in the
community. We used code written for R (version 2.11.1;
R Development Core Team 2010) by Owen Petchy and
Evan Weiher to calculate indices.
We assessed changes in the functional strategies of the
community using two approaches. First, we used a
traditional approach that examines changes in the
relative abundance of plant functional types (C4
graminoids, C3 graminoids, C3 forbs, and C3 legumes).
Second, we examined temporal shifts along the three
plant strategy axes. As recommended by Webb et al.
(2010), we used principal components analysis (PCA) to
reduce the dimensionality of the 78 species 3 8
functional trait matrix; three axes represented 71% of
the variation in the correlation matrix. The resulting
eigenvectors (Table 1) were used to calculate species
scores on each of the three orthogonal strategy axes. We
scaled these species-level strategies up to the community
level for each plot in each time period by calculating a
matrix of community-weighted mean strategy axis scores
(C) as follows: C ¼ RS, where R is an n 3 p matrix of
species’ relative abundances (see Appendix B), n is the
number of plots (82 plots 3 2 time periods ¼ 164), p is
the number of species (78), S is a p 3 t matrix of
principal component axis scores, and t is the number of
principal components (3). Changes in herbaceous
understory plant strategies were quantiﬁed by subtract-
ing the historical community-weighted mean strategy

axis score from the recent community-weighted mean
strategy axis score for each of the three axes. Our
analysis assumes that trait values have not changed
appreciably within species over the last century. This is
reasonable because many phenotypic traits are con-
served within species over much longer time scales,
permitting the identiﬁcation of plant material preserved
for tens of thousands of years (e.g., Cole 2010).
Forest structure
We measured overstory trees on 20 3 20 m plots
centered on each chart quadrat. For each tree (live and
dead) we recorded species, condition, and diameter at
breast height (dbh; 1.37 m) and calculated basal area
(m2/ha) and live tree density (trees/ha). Because data on
the overstory were not recorded in historical measure-
ments, we reconstructed historical tree densities and
basal areas for each 20 3 20 m plot at the dates of plot
establishment. We cored all live trees (N ¼ 3000
increment cores total) at 40 cm height for dendrochro-
nological analyses and used a forest reconstruction
model to calculate historical basal areas and densities (R
code from Bakker et al. 2008). In addition, historical and
recent timber harvest histories were compiled for each
plot to determine death dates of stumps. The model also
uses a decay submodel to account for current snags that
may have been living at the time of plot establishment.
These methods have been validated and demonstrated to
be reliable within 610% (Moore et al. 2004). The
relationship between (log10-transformed) pine basal area
and stem density among the 82 stands is signiﬁcantly
positive in both the historical time period (R2 ¼ 0.26, P
, 0.0001) and the recent time period (R2 ¼ 0.80, P ,
0.0001); thus, increases in stem density were also
associated with increases in basal area on these plots.
Statistical analyses
Because these data are repeated measurements on
permanent plots, we used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test
to evaluate whether changes in community attributes
differed signiﬁcantly from zero (a ¼ 0.05 for all tests). In
order to determine whether changes in vegetation
attributes were associated with changes in forest
structure, we regressed the changes in vegetation
attributes on changes in pine basal area. In Appendix
C we report ANCOVA results where time is the main
effect and pine basal area is the continuous covariate.
We evaluated changes in the relative foliar cover of each
of four functional type categories with a likelihood ratio
contingency test (v2).
RESULTS
Pine basal area and stem density increased signiﬁ-
cantly between the early 1900s and recent measurements
(Table 2). Understory plant foliar and basal cover
declined by 21% and 10%, respectively, since the early
1900s (Table 2). Changes in herbaceous foliar cover and
basal cover were negatively correlated with changes in
pine basal area (Fig. 1a, d). A total of 78 understory
species were detected in the quadrats; 53 in historical
samples and 66 in the recent samples. Despite this
increase in total detected species, plot-level species
richness declined (Table 2) by approximately two species
per square meter. Changes in species richness were
negatively and linearly correlated with changes in pine
basal area (Fig. 1b), but evenness changes were
uncorrelated with changes in pine basal area (Fig. 1e).
Both indices of functional diversity decreased over time
(Table 2), and were negatively correlated with increases
in pine basal area (Fig. 1c, f).
The relative abundances of C4 and C3 graminoids
were nearly equal in the historical time period. However,
C4 relative abundance declined by 18%, C3 relative
abundance increased by 19%, and legume relative
abundance declined by 2% (Fig. 2). Shifts in the ﬁrst
strategy axis were weakly negatively correlated with
changes in pine basal area (Fig. 1g), indicating a shift in
dominance toward species with lower leaf [N], ﬁne root
[N], and SLA, and higher LDMC. Shifts in the second
strategy axis were positively correlated with changes in

toward species with larger seed mass and lower SRL.
Changes in the third strategy axis were negatively
correlated with increases in pine basal area (Fig. 1i),
indicating a shift in dominance toward shorter species

DISCUSSION
A century of increasing ponderosa pine density was
associated with shifts in herbaceous plant strategies and
reduced functional diversity. Shade- and stress-tolerant
herbaceous plants that use a more conservative strategy
for acquiring and maintaining resources have increased
in relative abundance over time likely because light,
water, and nutrients have become more limiting beneath
the dense overstory.
Increases in pine density were associated with slight
shifts along the ﬁrst strategy axis toward communities
dominated by plants with low SLA, low leaf and root
[N], and high LDMC. Species with low leaf and ﬁne root
tissue [N] are generally slower-growing, stress-tolerant
species that conserve their acquired nutrients and dry
mass (Reich et al. 1997). Species with low ﬁne root [N]
are adapted to persist in low nutrient soils (Grime 1979)
such as those found beneath dense stands of pine (Kaye
and Hart 1998). Decomposition rates have likely
declined with increasing pine basal area due to both
the increase of recalcitrant pine needles on the forest
ﬂoor and the shift toward herbaceous understory species
with slower decomposition rates (Laughlin et al. 2010).
This understory shift may also be partly responsible for
slower N mineralization and nitriﬁcation rates beneath
dense pine canopies (Kaye and Hart 1998).
We observed long-term shifts along the second plant
strategy axis toward communities dominated by plants
with larger seed mass and lower SRL, perhaps due to the
reported advantage of large seeded species when
germinating in deep litter and shade (Grime and Jeffrey
1965). Nutrients are less available in soils beneath dense
forest stands because nutrients are tied up in the canopy
biomass and because recalcitrant pine needles release N
into the soil slowly (Kaye and Hart 1998). Therefore,

dense forest conditions might favor herbaceous species
with low SRL that slowly acquire and conserve mineral
nutrients.
We also observed shifts along the third strategy axis
toward dominance by shorter plants that ﬂower earlier.
Tall species are better able to acquire light (Keddy and
Shipley 1989), but beneath dense canopies it is more
important to be shade-tolerant than to be able to acquire
light. In this ﬂora, shorter species also tend to ﬂower
earlier in the growing season (Laughlin et al. 2010). We
speculate that earlier ﬂowering times may be indicative
of a temporal segregation of belowground competition
because ﬁne root production in ponderosa pine is
highest late in the growing season (Gaylord et al.
2007). In addition, the change in mean ﬂowering time
reﬂects the increases in cool-season C3 graminoids and
decreases in warm-season C4 graminoids. The decline in
C4 graminoid abundance with increases in pine basal
area suggests that species with high photosynthetic
water-use-efﬁciency are adapted to persist in the
warmer, high light, and likely drier environment of
open forest stands (Naumburg and DeWald 1999). The
increase in the relative abundance of C3 species might
also be the result of higher concentrations of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere (Poorter 1993).
These permanent quadrats permitted us to examine
vegetation dynamics over a ;100-year time period. Our
ﬁndings illustrate how the usefulness of historical plots
extends beyond their original objectives. Nevertheless,
this long-term data set is not without its limitations. The
permanent quadrats were not established within an
experimental design framework that allows rigorous
hypothesis testing. Our analyses of this long-term
‘‘natural experiment’’ were therefore necessarily correl-
ative. However, signiﬁcant relationships between long-
term changes in pine basal area and changes in
herbaceous understory attributes provide stronger sup-
port for causal relationships than spatial association
within one time period. Nonetheless, forest structure is
but one environmental gradient that inﬂuences the
assembly of understory plant communities in this
ecosystem. Other factors that could have contributed
to the observed changes in functional trait distributions
include past land-uses (e.g., livestock grazing), soil
properties, climate change, and ﬁre. We view ﬁre and
grazing as indirect factors in this study since both factors
inﬂuenced the long-term increase in pine density
(Bakker and Moore 2007). However, the direct effects
of ﬁre and grazing on understory trait distributions are
also likely important in this system. Though we could
not analyze grazing effects with this data set directly, we
speculate that release from heavy grazing would favor
perennial graminoids, thereby decreasing community-
weighted mean SLA and increasing height and seed
mass (Laughlin et al. 2010).
Our analysis of temporal changes in plant strategies
provides a general framework for evaluating composi-
tional and functional changes in terrestrial plant
communities. Detecting species turnover over time does
not equate to shifts in function unless the traits of the
community have also changed. Reducing multiple
correlated traits to orthogonal strategy axes (Reich et
al. 2003, Webb et al. 2010) increases the generality of the
analysis and facilitates comparisons with other ecosys-
tems where similar functional gradients among species
have been observed.
