Monitoring Landscape-Scale Forest Structure and Potential Fire 
Behavior Changes Following Ponderosa Pine Restoration Treatments 
 
John Paul Roccaforte 
 
We evaluated landscape-scale forest restoration treatment implementation and 
effectiveness and assessed canopy fuels and potential fire behavior changes following 
landscape-scale forest restoration treatments in a ponderosa pine forest at Mt. Trumbull, 
Arizona. The goal of the project was to alter forest structure by thinning and burning to 
more closely resemble forest conditions prior to Euro-American settlement in 1870. We 
measured 117 permanent plots before (1996/97) and after (2003) treatments. The plots 
were evenly distributed across the landscape and represented an area of approximately 
1200 ha, about half of which was an untreated control. The success of treatment 
implementation was variable. Most of the area originally planned for restoration was 
treated in some manner by 2003; however, only 70% received the full planned treatment 
(thin and burn). Although pine density decreased significantly in the treated area, the 
projected residual density was exceeded by 111-256%. Despite contract amendments to 
terminate oak cutting, some oaks were still cut for several reasons. Thirteen percent of the 
presettlement pines died in the treated area by 2003 slightly exceeding the 10% 
maximum allowable mortality outlined by managers; however, 9% percent of the 
presettlement pines died in the control. One-third of large snags were lost, falling below 
 
ii

the snag retention target, but new large snags were recruited, resulting in a net increase in 
snag density within the treated area. Implementation goals for large logs were achieved. 
Restoration treatments decreased canopy fuel load (CFL) and canopy bulk density (CBD) 
in the treated area, while slight increases occurred in the control. Predicted outcomes 
were consistent between the two fire behavior models (FlamMap and Nexus): under 
extreme drought and wind conditions, active crown fire hazard was reduced in the treated 
area. In contrast, the models show little change in active crown fire hazard in the control 
over the same time period. Although restoration treatments were not implemented 
perfectly, they were effective in attaining the overall project goal of restoring more open 
forest structure conditions while preserving most of the presettlement trees. Furthermore, 
canopy fuels and active crown fire hazard were substantially reduced, allowing for the 
reintroduction of low-intensity surface fires.

Chapter 1 
 
Introduction 
 
Southwestern ponderosa pine ecosystems have undergone substantial changes in 
forest structure, fuel loads, and crown fire hazard due to the cessation of the historical fire 
regime (Cooper 1960, Covington and Moore 1994a, 1994b). Prior to European 
settlement, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson var. scopulorum Engelm.) 
forests were historically comprised of a matrix of native herbaceous species interspersed 
with patches of large, mature trees (White 1985, Covington et al. 1997) and a smaller 
component of seedlings and saplings (Mast et al. 1999, Bailey and Covington 2002). This 
open, park-like structure was maintained by frequent, surface fires until fire exclusion 
occurred in the late 1800‚Äôs associated with Euro-American settlement (Covington and 
Moore 1994a). By the mid-1900‚Äôs, foresters recognized that excessive livestock grazing, 
logging, and fire suppression had contributed to increased tree density and crown fire 
hazard (Pearson 1910, Weaver 1951). 
In the mid-1990‚Äôs, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Ecological 
Restoration Institute (ERI) at Northern Arizona University (NAU) initiated a landscape-
scale restoration project (~1500 ha) intended to restore ecosystem health and reduce 
crown fire hazard while monitoring a wide variety of ecosystem components and 
processes in order to adapt restoration practices based on observation of treatment effects 
(Moore et al. 2003). Prior to treatment, the ERI installed a grid of permanent plots across 
the project area (including a ~500 ha untreated control) to collect data on contemporary 
 
1

and historical forest conditions. In addition, fire scars were collected throughout the 
landscape and indicated that the long-term frequent fire regime was abruptly interrupted 
in 1870. Restoration treatments were implemented beginning in 1996 and included a 
thinning prescription designed to emulate presettlement forest structure conditions 
followed by prescribed surface fire. In 2003, a subset of plots was remeasured 
representing a large portion of the project area (~700 ha treated area, ~500 ha control). 
Fire behavior models are important tools for fire managers and are often used to 
develop and evaluate alternative treatments, to estimate fire effects, to assess risk to life 
and property, and to understand ecosystems (Andrews and Queen 2001, Reinhardt et al. 
2001). In this study, we used two models to assess the effectiveness of restoration 
treatments on crown fire hazard at Mt. Trumbull. FlamMap (Finney, in preparation), a 
GIS-based system, assesses fuel hazards and uses terrain, fuels, and weather inputs to 
predict potential fire behavior for each individual pixel on the raster landscape 
simultaneously. Nexus, another hazard model, uses plot- or stand-level data to predict 
potential fire behavior (Scott and Reinhardt 1999, 2001).  
Canopy fuels are a crucial input for both models but they are rarely measured 
directly. Brown (1978) provided allometric equations for ponderosa pine that have been 
widely applied. In Arizona, Ful√© et al. (2001, 2004) applied locally developed allometric 
equations that predicted less canopy fuel, and hence lower canopy bulk density, than 
would have been predicted by Brown‚Äôs (1978) equations. Cruz et al. (2003) developed 
stand-level equations to predict canopy fuels based on tree density and basal area. 
Because these three approaches differ, the selection of a canopy fuel modeling approach 
 
2

may affect fire behavior model results. We compared canopy fuel estimates produced by 
all three equations and used each as an input for both FlamMap and Nexus. 
The goal of this study was to provide feedback from monitoring for the adaptive 
management process in the Mt. Trumbull restoration project. Although several smaller 
adaptive changes had already occurred throughout the course of the project, this study 
represents the first landscape-scale evaluation of treatment implementation and 
effectiveness based on forest structure monitoring data collected before and after 
treatment. The objectives of this study were to: 1) determine whether restoration 
treatments were implemented as planned; 2) determine whether the treatments were 
effective in terms of the ultimate ecological restoration goals; 3) compare three common 
canopy fuel estimation approaches using data collected in this study; 4) compare the 
output from FlamMap and Nexus; and 5) assess the effectiveness of landscape-scale 
restoration treatments on reducing crown fire hazard.

Literature Review 
 
Introduction 
The degradation of Southwestern ecological systems and the associated threat to 
biodiversity was addressed by Aldo Leopold (1924, 1934) in the early 20th century. 
Today, concerns about increasing stand-replacing crown fires, insect outbreaks, and 
pathogen epidemics in western United States forested ecosystems have brought the topic 
to the environmental, economic, and political forefront (Covington 2000, Covington 
2002). According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, ‚Äúthe number of uncontrollable 
and catastrophically destructive wildfires is the most extensive and serious national forest 
health-related problem in the interior West‚Äù (U.S GAO 1998). Presettlement ponderosa 
pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson var. scopulorum Engelm.) forests were 
historically comprised of a matrix of native shrub, grass, and forb species interspersed 
with patches of large, mature trees (White 1985, Covington et al. 1997) and a smaller 
component of seedlings and saplings (Mast et al. 1999, Bailey and Covington 2002). This 
open, park-like structure was maintained by frequent, low-intensity surface fires until fire 
exclusion occurred in the late 1800‚Äôs associated with Euro-American settlement 
(Covington and Moore 1994a). Ponderosa pine ecosystems throughout the southwestern 
United States have become uncharacteristically dense and structurally homogeneous as a 
result of heavy livestock grazing, logging, fire exclusion, and climatic factors (Cooper 
1960, Covington and Moore 1994b, Covington et al. 1997). These changes in fire regime 
 
6

and forest structure have increased vulnerability of ponderosa pine forests to large, stand-
replacing crown fires that endanger human and ecological communities (Allen et al. 
2002). Ecological restoration provides an opportunity to restore the natural structure and 
function of these fire-adapted ecosystems consistent with their evolutionary environment 
(Moore et al. 1999).  
 
Ecological Restoration of Ponderosa Pine Ecosystems 
The first attempts at restoring ponderosa pine forest ecosystem structure and 
function began with the reintroduction of surface fire (Weaver 1951, Biswell 1972, 
Covington and Sackett 1984). Prescribed fires reduced fuel loading and increased forest 
floor nutrients (Covington and Sackett 1992), but did not reduce continuous vertical fuels 
in the form of small diameter trees nor prevent mortality in presettlement trees (Sackett 
and Hasse 1998). In the early 1990‚Äôs an intensive, fine-scale restoration experiment at 
Gus Pearson Natural Area (GPNA) combined mechanical thinning of small-diameter 
trees with prescribed surface fire (Covington et al. 1997). This resulted in forest structure 
closer to the desired presettlement conditions as well as improved ecosystem function 
(Covington et al. 1997, Kaye et al. 2005) and improved health and vigor of older/larger 
trees (Kolb et al. 1998, Feeney et al. 1998, Stone et al. 1999, Skov et al. 2004). However, 
it was not possible to repeat the intensive restoration treatments implemented at GPNA 
on a landscape-scale or to extrapolate GPNA findings to larger tracts of land because of 
the unique characteristics of the never-logged Natural Area. Therefore, landscape-scale 
restoration research was necessary for further understanding of southwestern ponderosa 
pine ecosystems.

Mt. Trumbull 
Mt. Trumbull is located in the Uinkaret Mountains on the Arizona Strip in the 
Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument and managed by the Bureau of Land 
Management (BLM). A 7,000 ha ponderosa pine ecosystem lies in a broad saddle 
between Mt. Trumbull and Mt. Logan, two extinct volcanoes (Friederici 2003). Native 
Americans, who named the mountains the Uinkarets or ‚Äúregion of pines,‚Äù inhabited the 
Mt. Trumbull area for millennia before it was settled by Euro-Americans circa 1870 
(Altschul and Fairley 1989). Records from fire-scarred trees suggest that relatively open 
forest structure was maintained by a frequent fire regime prior to Euro-American 
settlement in 1870 (Waltz and Ful√© 1998, Heinlein et al. 1999). Shortly thereafter, a small 
sawmill was constructed at Nixon Springs and logging began mainly for the construction 
of the St. George Mormon Temple (R. Davis, pers. comm.). The mill could not process 
trees greater than 32‚Äù dbh (81 cm), therefore the largest ponderosa pines were not 
harvested and many remain throughout the Mt. Trumbull area today (Moore et al. 2003). 
Livestock grazing removed the fine fuels that supported frequent, low-intensity fires prior 
to settlement and most ignitions that occurred during the latter 20th century were 
suppressed (Altschul and Fairley 1989). These land use changes facilitated ponderosa 
pine seedling irruptions outside the historic range of variability consistent with those 
documented throughout the southwestern United States (Cooper 1960, White 1985, 
Savage et al. 1996). 
Initiated in 1995, the Mt. Trumbull Ponderosa Pine Ecosystem Restoration Project 
is the longest running landscape-scale ponderosa pine restoration project in the Southwest 
(Friederici 2003) and the first to incorporate operational treatments and intensive 
 
8

monitoring. The primary goal of the project was to restore forest structure and ecosystem 
processes to within the historical range of variability, as well as reduce fuel loads, disrupt 
fuel continuity, and reduce the likelihood of stand-replacing crown fires by implementing 
landscape-scale mechanical thinning followed by prescribed surface fire (Moore et al. 
1999, Moore et al. 2003). Another goal of the project was to monitor a wide variety of 
ecosystem components and processes in order to adapt restoration practices based on 
observation of treatment effects (Moore et al. 2003). 
 
Adaptive Management and Monitoring 
Adaptive management (AM) is the process of adjusting management actions 
based on monitoring information (Holling 1978, Walters 1986). This ‚Äúlearn by doing‚Äù 
approach has been used in natural resource management since the 1970‚Äôs; it involves 
setting goals, planning, and commitment to monitoring. AM is classified into two types: 
‚Äúpassive‚Äù and ‚Äúactive‚Äù (Walters and Holling 1990). In passive AM, the management 
action considered best is designed and implemented and adjustments are made based on 
monitoring and evaluation. In active AM, a range of alternatives are designed and 
implemented, then monitoring and evaluation are used to identify which alternative was 
most effective in meeting objectives, and finally adjustments to subsequent management 
decisions are made based on those conclusions (Murray and Marmorek 2003). 
Monitoring, or repeated measurement of ecological variables through time, is 
crucial for evaluating management actions (Ful√© 2003). Implementation and effectiveness 
monitoring are particularly important when adaptive management principles are used 
(Block et al. 2001, Moir and Block 2001). Implementation monitoring is defined as ‚Äúthe 
 
9

process of determining if a planned activity was accomplished‚Äù (Noss and Cooperrider 
1994). Implementation monitoring reveals to managers whether the treatments were 
implemented as originally prescribed. It would be difficult to justify changing treatment 
prescriptions if managers were unsure whether the original prescriptions were followed. 
Effectiveness monitoring is defined as ‚Äúthe process of determining if an activity achieved 
the stated goal or objectives‚Äù (Noss and Cooperrider 1994), and allows managers to 
determine if objectives were met and whether or not to alter implementation methods or 
treatments. The implementation of treatments and the ultimate effectiveness of treatments 
in a project may not necessarily have the same success. For example, the goals of a 
project could be met even if the treatments were not implemented as planned. 
Alternatively, the treatment could be carried out precisely, but the desired goals may not 
be met at all. 
 
Reference Conditions 
Ecological restoration often aims to repair degradation by re-establishing the 
historical composition, structure, and function of indigenous ecosystems (Society for 
Ecological Restoration 1993). Reference conditions refer to the historical range of 
variability of ecosystem structures and processes (Morgan et al. 1994, Landres et al. 
1999) and are often used as a baseline to evaluate restoration treatment effectiveness 
(Moore et al. 1999). In southwestern ponderosa pine, reference conditions are usually 
determined based on the date of Euro-American settlement which often coincides with 
the date of the last widespread surface fire; however, historical records, plot data, 
photographs and accounts can also be used as supplemental lines of evidence (Moore et 
 
10

al. 1999). Reference conditions can be further corroborated with contemporary reference 
sites where historical forest structure and fire regimes are relatively intact (Ful√© and 
Covington 1996, Ful√© and Covington 1999, Ful√© et al. 2002a, Ful√© et al. 2003, Stephens 
and Ful√© 2005). Nonetheless, many authors argue that using ecosystem conditions present 
at the time of Euro-American settlement as a point of reference is subjective and arbitrary 
and should not be used exclusively as a guide for future management (Southwest Forest 
Alliance 2000, Wagner et al. 2000). 
 
Types of Wildland Fire 
Wildland fire is classified into ground (sub-surface), surface, or crown categories 
based on where in the fuel strata burning occurs (Pyne et al. 1996). Crown fires are 
further subdivided into three types: passive, active, and independent (Van Wagner 1977). 
Passive crown fire, or torching, occurs when fire transitions from the surface and ignites 
the lower canopy.  The windspeed at which torching is initiated, the ‚Äútorching index,‚Äù is 
largely a function of canopy base height. Active crown fires burn the entire 
surface/canopy fuel complex, depending primarily on the bulk density of foliage and fine 
twigs in the canopy. Independent crown fires, or active crown fires that do not rely on 
surface fire, are extremely rare and not considered further here. Since passive and active 
crown fire behavior are linked to different canopy fuel variables, it is possible to 
encounter a situation where passive crown fire is not predicted to occur, due to a high 
canopy base height, but active crown fire could occur, due to high canopy bulk density. 
Scott and Reinhardt (2001) described this hysteresis as a ‚Äúconditional‚Äù surface fire; active 
 
11

crown fire could occur on the condition that canopy burning entered the stand from 
outside, otherwise surface fire would occur. 
 
Fuel Treatment Effects on Fire Behavior 
The fire environment triangle is comprised of three influencing forces: fuel, 
weather, and topography (Pyne et al. 1996). The fuels leg is most related to forest 
structure and is the only one that can be altered by management actions (Agee 1996). 
Many restoration and fuel treatment projects have been implemented throughout the 
western United States to restore natural ecosystem structure and function and to reduce 
the threat of stand-replacing crown fires (Scott 1998, Lynch et al. 2000, Ful√© et al. 2001a, 
Stratton 2004). Such studies that examine treatment effects on fire behavior or severity 
can be classified into three categories: experimental, observational, and modeling. 
Experimental studies test fire behavior by purposely igniting fires and examining the 
effects during and after the burn. Although researchers have deliberately ignited crown 
fires to study their properties in certain isolated settings (Alexander et al. 2004), most 
experimental studies are focused on effects of relatively low-intensity fires (Weaver 
1957, Covington et al. 1997, Ful√© et al. 2002b) because intentionally lighting large, stand-
replacing crown fires is difficult to justify. Observational studies examine the effects of 
wildfires after they occur. Pollet and Omi (2002), Martinson and Omi (2003), Graham 
(2003), and Cram and Baker (2003) examined fire effects in treated and untreated forest 
stands in several western states, finding that treated stands generally show lower fire 
severity, although treatments did not necessarily preclude severe burning or prevent the 
passage of landscape-scale crown fires. Following the 2002 Rodeo-Chediski fire in 
 
12

Arizona, Finney et al. (2005) used satellite imagery and Strom (2005) used ground data to 
show that burning and/or cutting + burning treatments substantially reduced fire severity. 
Observational approaches are essential for measuring real-world effects of treatments, but 
the scope of inference of the approach remains limited by lack of pre-fire data, 
randomization, and replication. The final technique, fire behavior modeling, is the most 
removed from actual fire behavior but the most flexible for testing alternative scenarios 
of stand development, treatments, or weather conditions. Various studies have used 
models to evaluate potential fire behavior after restoration or fuel treatments at scales 
ranging from stands (Stephens 1998, Ful√© et al. 2001a & 2001b, Ful√© et al. 2002b,) to 
landscapes (Fiedler and Keegan 2003, Ful√© et al. 2004, Stratton 2004). 
 
Fire Behavior Modeling 
Fire behavior models are important tools for fire managers and are often used to 
develop and evaluate alternative treatments, to estimate fire effects, to assess risk to life 
and property, and to understand ecosystems (Andrews and Queen 2001, Reinhardt et al. 
2001). Deterministic semi-empirical fire behavior models based on Rothermel‚Äôs (1972) 
surface fire model coupled with canopy initiation and spread models are widely used in 
fire behavior analysis. FARSITE, a GIS-based system, uses terrain, fuels, and weather 
inputs to simulate the growth, spread, and behavior of wildland fires (Finney 1998). The 
variant FlamMap (Finney, in preparation), adapted for assessing fuel hazards, uses most 
of the same inputs as FARSITE but predicts potential fire behavior for each individual 
pixel on the raster landscape simultaneously. Nexus, another hazard model, uses plot- or 
stand-level data to predict potential fire behavior (Scott and Reinhardt 1999, 2001).  
 
13

FlamMap and Nexus differ in crown fire outputs provided, with FARSITE simulating 
only passive and active crown fire, while Nexus also provides estimates of conditional 
surface fire. 
 
Canopy Fuel Estimation and Measurement 
Canopy fuels are a crucial input for models that predict crown fire but they are rarely 
measured directly. Brown (1978) provided allometric equations for ponderosa pine that 
have been widely applied. In Arizona, Ful√© et al. (2001a, 2004) applied locally developed 
allometric equations that predicted less canopy fuel, and hence lower canopy bulk 
density, than would have been predicted by Brown‚Äôs (1978) equations. Cruz et al. (2003) 
developed stand-level equations to predict canopy fuels based on tree density and basal 
area. Because these three approaches differ, the selection of a canopy fuel modeling 
approach may affect fire behavior model results. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Implementation of ecological restoration and other fuel treatments in 
southwestern ponderosa pine forests will likely increase in the future. It is also likely that 
the scale of these projects will broaden from stand- and landscape-scale to the scale of 
entire watersheds. It will be important that long-term monitoring and research also focus 
on broader scales so that we can avoid exclusively extrapolating information from fine to 
broad scales.

Monitoring Landscape-Scale Forest Structure Changes Following 
Ponderosa Pine Restoration Treatments 
 
Abstract 
We evaluated landscape-scale forest restoration treatment implementation and 
effectiveness in a ponderosa pine forest at Mt. Trumbull, Arizona. The goal of the project 
was to alter forest structure by thinning and burning to more closely resemble forest 
conditions prior to Euro-American settlement in 1870. We measured 117 permanent plots 
before (1996/97) and after (2003) treatments. The plots were evenly distributed across the 
landscape and represented an area of approximately 1200 ha, about half of which was an 
untreated control. For tree density, we evaluated implementation success based on the 
projected density of ponderosa pine; we evaluated treatment implementation and 
effectiveness for other variables based on goals outlined by managers or 1870 conditions. 
The success of treatment implementation was variable. About 94% of the area originally 
planned for restoration was treated in some manner by 2003; however, only 70% received 
the full planned treatment (thin and burn). Although pine density was reduced 
significantly by 66% from 428.6 pines/ha to 146.3 pines/ha in the treated area, the 
projected density was exceeded by 111-256%. Pine density exceeded the projected 
outcome by only 10-85% when only thinned and burned plots were analyzed. Despite 
contract amendments to terminate oak cutting, 32.3 oaks/ha were cut even after the 
decision to stop. Thirteen percent of the presettlement pines died in the treated area by 
2003, slightly exceeding the 10% maximum allowable mortality outlined by managers; 
 
22

however, 9% percent of presettlement pines also died in the control, indicating that 
presettlement pines in untreated areas were nearly as vulnerable as those exposed to 
restoration treatments. Goals for large snag retention were not achieved but new snags 
were recruited above expectations, resulting in a 45% net increase in snag density within 
the treated area. Sixty-five percent of logs >50 cm were retained, thus, implementation 
goals for large logs were achieved. Although restoration treatments were not 
implemented perfectly, they were effective in attaining the overall project goal of 
restoring more open forest structure conditions while preserving more than 75% of the 
presettlement pines. Furthermore, canopy fuel loads were substantially reduced, allowing 
for the reintroduction of low-intensity surface fires. The Mt. Trumbull restoration project 
serves as a useful example of a collaborative effort between managers and researchers 
with a strong commitment to monitoring ecological responses to restoration treatments.

Introduction 
Changes in fire regime and forest structure have increased vulnerability of 
ponderosa pine forests to large, stand-replacing crown fires that endanger human and 
ecological communities (Allen et al. 2002). Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. 
Lawson var. scopulorum Engelm.) ecosystems throughout the southwestern United States 
have become uncharacteristically dense and structurally homogeneous as a result of 
heavy livestock grazing, logging, fire exclusion, and climatic factors (Cooper 1960, 
 
23

Covington and Moore 1994a, 1994b, Covington et al. 1997). Ecological restoration 
provides an opportunity to restore the natural structure and function of these fire-adapted 
ecosystems consistent with their evolutionary environment (Moore et al. 1999). 
Landscape-scale monitoring is necessary to understand how restoration practices affect 
sizeable tracts of land as restoration implementation becomes more prevalent. 
Initiated in 1995, the Mt. Trumbull Ponderosa Pine Ecosystem Restoration Project 
is the longest running landscape-scale ponderosa pine restoration project in the Southwest 
(Friederici 2003) and the first to incorporate operational treatments and intensive 
monitoring. The primary goal of the project was to restore forest structure and ecosystem 
processes within the historical range of variability, as well as reduce fuel loads, disrupt 
fuel continuity, and reduce the likelihood of stand-replacing crown fires by implementing 
landscape-scale mechanical thinning followed by prescribed surface fire (Moore et al. 
1999, Moore et al. 2003). Finally, we aimed to monitor a wide variety of ecosystem 
components and processes in order to adapt restoration practices based on observations of 
treatment effects. 
Adaptive management (AM) includes the process of adjusting management 
actions based on monitoring information (Holling 1978, Walters 1986). This ‚Äúlearn by 
doing‚Äù approach has been used in natural resource management since the 1970‚Äôs; it 
involves setting goals, planning, and commitment to monitoring. AM is classified into 
two types: ‚Äúpassive‚Äù and ‚Äúactive‚Äù (Walters and Holling 1990). In passive AM, the 
management action considered best is designed and implemented and adjustments are 
made based on monitoring and evaluation. In active AM, a range of alternatives are 
designed and implemented, then monitoring and evaluation are used to identify which 
 
24

alternative was most effective in meeting objectives, and finally adjustments to 
subsequent management decisions are made based on those conclusions (Murray and 
Marmorek 2003). 
Monitoring, or repeated measurement of ecological variables through time, is 
crucial for evaluating management actions (Ful√© 2003). Implementation and effectiveness 
monitoring are particularly important when adaptive management principles are used 
(Block et al. 2001, Moir and Block 2001). Implementation monitoring is defined as ‚Äúthe 
process of determining if a planned activity was accomplished‚Äù (Noss and Cooperrider 
1994). Implementation monitoring reveals to managers whether the treatments were 
implemented as originally prescribed. It would be difficult to justify changing treatment 
prescriptions if mangers were unsure whether the original prescriptions were followed. 
Effectiveness monitoring is defined as ‚Äúthe process of determining if an activity achieved 
the stated goal or objectives‚Äù (Noss and Cooperrider 1994), and allows managers to 
determine if objectives were met and whether or not to alter implementation methods or 
treatments.  The implementation of treatments and the ultimate effectiveness of 
treatments in a project may not necessarily have the same success. For example, the goals 
of a project could be met even if the treatments were not implemented as planned. 
Alternatively, the treatment could be carried out precisely, but the desired goals may not 
be met at all. 
Our objective in this study was to evaluate monitoring data and apply it to the 
adaptive management process in the Mt. Trumbull restoration project. Although several 
smaller adaptive changes had already occurred throughout the course of project 
implementation (Waltz et al. 2000), this study represents the first landscape-scale 
 
25

evaluation of treatment implementation and effectiveness based on forest structure 
monitoring data collected before and after treatment. Specifically, we intend to answer 
two overarching questions: 1) Were restoration treatments implemented as planned?, and 
2) Were the treatments effective in terms of the ultimate ecological restoration goals? 
 
Methods 
Study Area 
 
Mt. Trumbull is located in the Uinkaret Mountains on the Arizona Strip in the 
Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument and managed by the Bureau of Land 
Management (BLM). Vegetation in the study area (elevation 2,000 to 2,250 m) is 
comprised of ponderosa pine and Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.) with Utah 
juniper (Juniperus osteosperma [Torr.] Little), pinyon pine (Pinus edulis Engelm.), New 
Mexico locust (Robinia neomexicana Gray) and several shrub species occurring 
throughout the area. Soils are derived from basaltic parent material. The two main soil 
types found in the study area are the Wutoma-Lozinta complex which consists of ashy-
skeletal over fragmental or cindery, mixed, mesic Vitrandic Haplustepts, and Sponiker 
soils, classified as fine, smectitic, mesic Pachic Argiustolls (Natural Resources 
Conservation Service 2004). 
Native Americans, who named the mountains the Uinkarets or ‚Äúregion of pines,‚Äù 
inhabited the Mt. Trumbull area for millennia before it was settled by Euro-Americans 
circa 1870 (Altschul and Fairley 1989). Records from fire-scarred trees suggest that 
relatively open forest structure conditions were maintained by a frequent fire regime prior 
 
26

to Euro-American settlement in 1870 (Waltz and Ful√© 1998, Heinlein et al. 1999, Ful√©, 
unpublished data). 
Annual precipitation at Nixon Flats (elevation 1,981 m, approximately 3 km NE 
of study site) averaged 47.2 cm with an average January temperature of 1¬∞C and an 
average July temperature of 21¬∞C between January 1992 and December 2003 (Western 
Regional Climate Center 2005). Annual precipitation at Mt. Logan (elevation 2,195 m, 
approximately 2 km SW of study site) averaged 31.2 cm with an average January 
temperature of -1¬∞C and an average July temperature of 20¬∞C between January 1986 and 
December 2003 (Western Regional Climate Center 2005). Most precipitation occurs in 
winter and during summer monsoon storms; spring and fall are relatively dry.  
 
About half of the approximately 1200 hectare study landscape (Figure 3.1) is a 
contiguous, ‚Äúuntreated‚Äù, densely-treed area (hereafter ‚Äúcontrol area‚Äù or ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù). The 
other half, hereafter ‚Äútreated area‚Äù, is adjacent to the control. Restoration treatments were 
carried out between 1996 and 2003 (Moore et al. 2003). Some untreated areas remain 
within the treated area boundary, such as controls for other experiments, or operationally 
inaccessible areas, ranging from approximately 10 to 40 hectares.  
 
Restoration Treatment Prescriptions 
The thinning design was based on the presettlement (pre-1870) pattern of tree 
species composition and spatial arrangement (Covington et al. 1997, Waltz et al. 2003). 
All living ponderosa pines older than 1870 or larger than 70 cm dbh were retained 
(Moore et al. 2003); presettlement ponderosa pines of any size were identified in the field 
based on yellow bark coloration and tree characteristics (White 1985). In addition, 
 
27

wherever evidence of presettlement remnant ponderosa pine material was encountered 
(i.e., snags, logs, stumps, stump holes), 1.5 postsettlement ponderosa pine replacement 
trees (if >40.6 cm diameter) or 3 ponderosa pine replacement trees (if ‚â§40.6 cm diameter) 
were retained within an approximately 18.2 m search radius. An implementation 
objective was to retain the presettlement ponderosa pines that were still alive, plus leave 
up to 300% more ponderosa pine trees than were present prior to 1870. The surplus of 
retained trees was intended to account for the smaller biomass contributed by smaller 
diameter replacement trees, possible loss of presettlement evidence, and to allow a 
margin for unintended mortality due to restoration treatments (Covington et al. 1997). 
Because postsettlement replacement trees were located near remnant evidence of 
presettlement structures, the spatial variability that existed prior to disturbance of the 
historical fire regime was reflected in the post-treatment forest structure. Therefore, 
rather than a ‚Äúone-size-fits-all‚Äù approach, areas that were relatively open in 1870 (i.e., 
few remnants found) would be relatively open after treatment and areas that were 
relatively dense in 1870 would be relatively dense after treatment. Originally, Gambel 
oak trees were also thinned, but given high oak mortality due to prescribed burning, these 
guidelines were modified early in the project to terminate oak cutting.  All living trees of 
other species (e.g., New Mexico locust) were not cut because they were so few in 
number. Unmarked trees were commercially logged or non-commercially thinned in this 
leave-tree thinning. Slash was lopped and scattered and was crushed by a bulldozer in 
some areas (Jerman et al. 2004). Prescribed burn preparation included raking 
accumulated forest floor material away from living presettlement trees to prevent cambial 
girdling (Sackett et al. 1996) and from large snags to limit ignition (Moore et al. 2003). 
 
28

Prescribed fires were often ignited at night when humidity was relatively high. It is 
important to note that although most of the treatments were completed by the time of our 
measurement in 2003, there were portions that were thinned only or burned only. 
 
Field Methods 
 
Prior to treatment in 1996 and 1997, we installed 117 permanent plots on a 300 
meter grid (Figure 3.1) throughout the Mt. Trumbull landscape as part of a before-after-
control-impact (BACI) study design (Stewart-Oaten and Bence 2001); all plots (55 
control, 61 treated, 1 partially treated, excluded from analysis) were remeasured in the 
summer of 2003. The plots were adapted from the National Park Service‚Äôs Fire 
Monitoring plots (Reeberg 1995, NPS 2003), with modifications to collect detailed tree 
condition and dendroecological data for reconstruction of historical forest structure. 
Sampling plots were 0.1 ha (20 x 50 m) in size, oriented with the 50-m sides uphill-
downhill to maximize sampling of variability along the elevational gradient and to permit 
correction of the plot area for slope. 
Overstory trees, those larger than 15 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were 
measured on the entire plot (1000 m2) and trees between 2.5-15 cm dbh (pole-sized trees) 
were measured on one quarter-plot (250 m2); all trees were tagged. Tree attributes 
measured were: species, dbh, and condition class [(1) live; (2) declining; (3) recent snag; 
(4) loose bark snag; (5) clean snag; (6) snag broken above breast height; (7) snag broken 
below breast height; (8) downed dead tree; (9) stump (Thomas et al. 1979); and (10), 
stump hole]. Total height was measured for pole-sized trees but not for overstory trees 
during the pre-treatment measurement; total height and crown base height were measured 
 
29

for all trees in 2003. All overstory and pole-sized trees were also mapped within the 
larger 1000 m¬≤ plot. Regeneration (seedlings and saplings <2.5 cm dbh) was tallied by 
species, condition, and height class in a 50 m2 subplot. Ponderosa pine trees were 
considered potentially presettlement if dbh ‚â•37.5 cm or if bark was yellowed (White 
1985). Trees of all other species were considered potentially presettlement if dbh ‚â•17 cm 
dbh (Barger and Ffolliott 1972). Tree cores were collected at 40 cm above ground level 
for all potentially presettlement trees and for a random 10% subsample of all other live 
trees ‚â•2.5 cm to determine past size, as described below. Canopy cover measured by 
vertical projection (Ganey and Block 1994) was recorded at 3 m intervals along the two 
50-m sidelines of each plot for a total of 32 points per plot. Post-treatment measurements 
on plots coincided as closely as possible to the original day and month of the original 
measurement. 
 
Reconstruction Methods 
Tree increment cores were surfaced and crossdated (Stokes and Smiley 1968) using 
locally developed tree-ring chronologies. Rings were counted on cores that could not be 
crossdated, especially young trees and junipers. Additional years to the center were 
estimated using a pith locator (concentric circles matched to the curvature and density of 
the inner rings) for cores without a pith (Applequist 1958). 
We reconstructed forest structure using dendroecological methods described in 
detail by Ful√© et al. (1997) and Mast et al. (1999). We reconstructed diameter for all 
living trees by subtracting the radial growth since 1870 measured on increment cores and 
estimated death date of dead trees based on tree condition class using diameter dependent 
 
30

snag decomposition rates (Thomas et al. 1979, Rogers et al. 1984). We performed a 
sensitivity analysis by using the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile decomposition rates to 
examine the effect of slower or faster decomposition on estimates of death date and 1870 
structure. Less than ¬±1% change in reconstructed forest structure occurred during this 
analysis, so the 50th percentile reconstruction was used in this study.  
Forest structure reconstruction methods were based on the assumption that 
evidence of all structures (i.e., snags, logs, stumps, stump holes) present in 1870 was 
intact, located, and correctly identified during the pre-treatment inventory. The 
probability that this occurred was relatively high given the absence of fire combined with 
the semi-arid environment limiting the decomposition of conifer wood (Ful√© et al. 1997, 
Mast et al. 1999, Waltz et al. 2003), and because field crews were trained to identify the 
presence and species of presettlement structures. Moore et al. (2004) found that 
reconstruction field techniques in a similar environment and forest type were reliable 
within ¬±10% of tree density over ~90 years. 
 
Evaluation of Treatment Implementation and Effectiveness 
We compared the projected outcomes to actual outcomes of tree density to 
evaluate whether or not thinning prescriptions were implemented as planned. Because the 
thinning prescriptions were based on living and dead presettlement ponderosa pine 
evidence that we measured on the plots, we evaluated the success of implementation 
quantitatively based on the projected outcome for ponderosa pine tree density calculated 
as the sum of all living presettlement trees plus 150-300% of the presettlement remnant 
evidence (1.5 - 3 postsettlement trees retained per presettlement evidence). The 
 
31

prescription called for retaining the living trees of the other species (with exception of 
some oak cutting early on in the project) based on the assumption that prescribed burning 
would thin these trees. Because a projected tree density was not set for non-ponderosa 
pines, we simply reported on cutting and mortality for these species. We evaluated 
treatment implementation and/or effectiveness for presettlement tree cutting and 
mortality, and snag and log densities based on goals outlined by managers and used 1870 
conditions to evaluate diameter distributions, regeneration, and canopy cover. 
 
Statistical Analysis 
We tested whether the control and treated areas differed in live tree density and 
basal area, snag and log density, regeneration density, and canopy cover before (1996/97) 
and after treatment (2003). Univariate analyses examined total response (e.g., total live 
tree density across all species). Multivariate analyses examined the composition of the 
total response (e.g., matrix of live tree density of each species).  
Univariate analyses were made using Wilcoxon tests to obtain a Z-score for each 
test in 1996/97 and in 2003. Changes in tree density and basal area from 1870 to 1996/97 
across the entire landscape were analyzed with Wilcoxon signed ranks tests (T+) because 
the control and treated areas were combined (Conover 1999). The alpha chosen for all 
analyses was 0.05. 
Multivariate analyses were made using a permutation-based ANOVA with 
DISTLM software (Version 5.0; Anderson 2005). This procedure permits the analysis of 
univariate or multivariate data using any distance measure and linear model. The 
calculated statistic is termed a ‚Äòpseudo-F‚Äô and is calculated, like a traditional F-statistic, 
 
32

as the sum of the squared distances among groups divided by the sum of the squared 
distances within groups (see Anderson (2001) and McArdle and Anderson (2001) for 
details). Data were untransformed and unstandardized. Dissimilarity matrices were 
calculated using the Bray-Curtis distance measure as this distance measure is appropriate 
for most ecological data (Faith et al. 1987). P-values were calculated by permuting the 
observations 9999 times, so no assumptions of the distributional form of the data were 
required. 
 
Results 
 
Reconstructed tree density and basal area indicated that relatively open conditions 
(average 97.3 trees/ha and 9.5 m¬≤/ha of basal area) existed over the entire landscape in 
1870. Ponderosa pine made up 95% of the total basal area but only 38% of total tree 
density (Table 3.1). The control and treated areas did not differ in terms of total tree 
density (Z=-0.9, P=0.367) in 1870; however, total basal area was slightly greater (Z=2.0, 
P=0.041) in the control (Table 3.1). The treated and control areas did not differ in terms 
of tree density composition (pseudo-F=2.6, P=0.055) or basal area composition (pseudo-
F=2.5, P=0.052) in 1870. By 1996/97, total tree density (T+=3392, P<0.001) and total 
basal area (T+=3325, P<0.001) increased significantly (779% increase and 245% 
increase, respectively) since 1870 across the entire landscape. While total tree density 
(Z=0.5, P=0.584), total basal area (Z=-0.4, P=0.676), and basal area composition 
(pseudo-F=0.04, P=0.952) in 1996/97 did not differ between treated and control areas, 
tree density composition (pseudo-F=2.8, P=0.033) was significantly different between 
the treated area and control. Ponderosa pine dominated the 1996/97 pre-treatment 
 
33

landscape making up 73% of the total trees/ha and 86% of total basal area in the control 
area and comprising 55% of the total trees/ha and 79% of the total basal area in the 
treated area. 
By 2003, total tree density (Z=5.0, P<0.0001) and total basal area (Z=5.1, 
P<0.001) were significantly decreased in the treated area (Table 3.1) and tree density 
composition (pseudo-F=17.1, P=0.0001) and basal area composition (pseudo-F=12.9, 
P=0.0001) were significantly different between the treated area and control. Although 
post-treatment forest structure was relatively open in the treated area, there were a range 
of densities ranging from extremely open sites (minimum of 10 trees/ha) to sites that 
were relatively dense (maximum of 1581 trees/ha). There were also relatively open areas 
in the control (minimum of 108 trees/ha), but the most dense areas (maximum of 3337 
trees/ha) were more than twice as dense as the most dense areas in the treated area. The 
variability throughout the landscape in all time periods is evident when stand density 
index (SDI), a measure of density that incorporates trees/ha and basal area/ha (Reineke 
1933), is interpolated across the plot grid (Figure 3.2). In 2003, ponderosa pine 
comprised 72% of total basal area but only made up 37% of the total trees/ha in the 
treated area. Conversely, Gambel oak made up 56% of the total trees/ha but only 
accounted for 26% of the basal area. The other three species were relatively sparse 
throughout the landscape in all time periods. Tree density and basal area were even lower 
in the 2003 treated area when plots that were thinned only, burned only, or not treated 
were excluded from analysis. Sites that were thinned and burned had 73% fewer trees/ha 
and 55% less basal area/ha compared to pre-treatment levels (Table 3.2). 
 
34

Nearly two-thirds of the overall reduction in total tree density and three-quarters 
in total basal area between 1996/97 and 2003 in the treated area was due to the thinning 
of ponderosa pine. The thinning of other species accounted for only about 3% of the 
overall decrease in total tree density and total basal area (Figure 3.3). Mortality of 
unthinned ponderosa pine accounted for 7% of the decrease in total tree density and 12% 
of the decrease in total basal area while mortality of the other species accounted for 19% 
of the reduction in total tree density but only 3% of the decrease in total basal area in the 
treated area. 
Actual ponderosa pine tree density in the treated area exceeded the projected 
outcome by 111-256%. Based on the pre-treatment sample data the projected outcome 
was to retain an average of 41.1 to 69.3 pines/ha comprised of 12.9 live presettlement 
pines/ha and 28.2 (150% of presettlement pine evidence) to 56.4 (300% of presettlement 
pine evidence) postsettlement replacement pines/ha. The post-treatment tree density 
averaged 146.3 pines/ha (Table 3.1) comprised of 10.4 live presettlement pines/ha and 
135.7 postsettlement pines/ha. Pine density averaged 76.2 pines/ha when only thinned 
and burned plots were analyzed (Table 3.2) exceeding the projected residual density by 
only 10-85%. 
One of the main goals of the restoration project was to avoid cutting and limit 
mortality of presettlement trees (trees with a center date older than 1870). However, a 
total of 3.0 presettlement trees/ha representing 0.18 m¬≤/ ha (PIPO=0.8 trees/ha and 0.1 
m¬≤/ha, QUGA=2.2 trees/ha and 0.08 m¬≤/ha) were cut during the restoration treatment; 
none were cut in the control. A total of 13.5 presettlement trees/ha representing 1.1 m¬≤/ha 
(PIPO=1.7 trees/ha and 0.7 m¬≤/ha, QUGA=11.6 trees/ha and 0.4 m¬≤/ha, JUOS=0.2 
 
35

trees/ha and 0.004 m¬≤) died in the treated area while a total of 2.8 presettlement trees/ha 
representing 0.5 m¬≤/ha (PIPO=1.3 trees/ha and 0.5 m¬≤/ha, QUGA=1.5 trees/ha and 0.06 
m¬≤/ha) died in the control.  However, 52.5 presettlement trees/ha representing 6.5 m¬≤/ha 
(PIPO=10.4 trees/ha and 4.8 m¬≤, QUGA= 41.1 trees/ha and 1.6 m¬≤/ha, JUOS= 1.0 
trees/ha and 0.07 m¬≤/ha) remained alive in the treated area and 45.6 presettlement trees/ha 
representing 6.1 m¬≤/ha (PIPO=13.8 trees/ha and 4.8 m¬≤, QUGA= 31.2 trees/ha and 1.26 
m¬≤/ha, JUOS= 0.55 trees/ha and 0.05 m¬≤/ha) remained alive in the control between 
1996/97 and 2003. 
The oldest living tree found in the study area was a ponderosa pine that was alive 
in 1455 (no pith on core) and the oldest oak had a center date of 1645; both were alive in 
2003. In the treated area, 1.2% of the living pines and 0.5% of the living oaks were 200 
years or older in 1996/97 compared to 2.8% (pine) and 0.4% (oak) in 2003. Nineteen 
percent of the pines and 40% of the oaks 200 years or older died after treatment. In the 
control, 1.4% of the living pines were 200 years or older in 1996/97 compared to 1.3% in 
2003; oaks that were 200 years or older comprised 0.3% of the living oaks in both time 
periods. Six percent of the pines and none of the oaks 200 years or older died by 2003 in 
the control. In sum, these results show that mortality of presettlement pines was only 
slightly greater in the treated area compared to the control despite thinning and burning in 
the treated area. Oaks were much more susceptible to mortality in the treated area where 
thinning and burning occurred compared to the control, and compared to pines in general. 
The diameter distribution of the treated forest shifted toward the historical 
distribution (Figure 3.4). In 1870, ponderosa pines <30 cm dbh comprised only 6% of the 
total trees/ha in the treated area and only 8% of the total trees/ha in the control. In the 
 
36

treated area, ponderosa pines <30 cm dbh comprised 40% of the overall total trees/ha 
prior to treatment and comprised 24% of the overall total in 2003.  Seventy-seven percent 
of the pines thinned were taken from diameter classes <30 cm at breast height. In the 
control, 60% of the trees were <30 cm dbh in both 1996/97 and 2003. The shift in 
diameter distribution was more pronounced when plots that were thinned only, burned 
only, or not treated were excluded from analysis. On thinned and burned plots, pines <30 
cm comprised only 16% of the overall total trees/ha (Figure 3.5). 
Ponderosa pine comprised the majority of snags and logs >30 cm throughout the 
study area. Snag densities increased slightly in the control (total snags >30 cm dbh 
increased 19%, total snags >50 cm dbh increased 40%) but increased substantially in the 
treated area (total snags >30 cm dbh increased 95%, total snags >50 cm dbh increased 
45%) between 1996/97 and 2003; however, no significant differences were found 
between the treated area and control for any time period or size category comparisons 
(Table 3.3). Log densities increased slightly in the control (logs >30 cm dbh increased 
4%, logs >50 cm dbh increased 30%), but decreased in the treated area (logs >30 cm dbh 
decreased 20%, logs >50 cm dbh decreased 27%) between 1996/97 and 2003 (Table 3.3). 
In 2003, density composition for logs >30 cm differed between the treated area and 
control (pseudo-F =3.9, P=0.03); however, no statistically significant differences were 
found for any other time period or size category comparisons. 
Regeneration was highly variable: minimum per-plot regeneration density was 
zero in both the treated and control areas and in both time periods and standard errors 
were high relative to means (Table 3.4). Gambel oak and New Mexico locust (both 
species can reproduce by sprouting) dominated regeneration density throughout the 
 
37

landscape before and after treatment; conifers had substantially lower densities. 
Combining all three height categories (Table 3.4), average total regeneration decreased 
by 10% in the control and 5% in the treated area between the two time periods. For stems 
<2 m in height in the treated area, locust increased by 49% after treatment; however, oak 
decreased by 14% and ponderosa pine decreased by 74%. In 2003, density composition 
for stems <30 cm in height differed between the treated area and control (pseudo-F=2.7, 
P=0.048); however, no significant differences were found for any other time period or 
height category comparisons. 
Canopy cover (Table 3.5) was not significantly different (Z=0.3, P=0.7) between 
the treated area and control in 1996/97, but was significantly reduced (Z=6.0, P<0.0001) 
in the treated area in 2003. Canopy cover in the treated area was reduced from a pre-
treatment average of 54% to a post-treatment average of 32%; there was little change in 
the control which remained at approximately 55%. The 2003 control had areas that were 
relatively open (minimum per-plot value = 9%) and the 2003 treated area had areas that 
were relatively dense (maximum per-plot value = 78%); these values represented outliers 
in each data set. Canopy cover for plots that were thinned and burned decreased from a 
pre-treatment average of 54% to a post-treatment average of 25%. Basal area explained 
47% (adjusted r¬≤) of the variation in canopy cover (y = 0.0099x + 0.2051; n=233).

Discussion 
Were the Restoration Treatments Implemented as Planned? 
Were areas slated for restoration actually treated; and if so, according to the planned 
activity and schedule? 
The treated area in 2003 closely resembled the original plan written in 1995 to 
thin and burn 433 ha within the approximately 700 ha treated area by 1998. About 94% 
of the area originally planned for restoration treatments was treated in some manner by 
2003. Of these 409 treated ha, 74% (304 ha) were thinned and burned, 4% (15 ha) were 
burned only, and 22% (90 ha) were thinned only. Progress was slower than expected due 
to conflicting concerns of environmental groups, ranchers, and forest workers (Ful√© 
2003), and operational delays (e.g., lack of bids on thinning contracts and small burning 
windows).  There were some notable changes to the original plan. Beginning in 1997, a 
nested stand-level study was introduced (Waltz et al. 2003) in which two small patches 
(24 ha total) were set aside as controls within the original treatment area and were not 
treated. Other areas were burned only (not thinned) due to the presence of archeological 
sites or were thinned only, since they had not yet been burned by our measurement in 
2003. 
Were the projected tree densities achieved after the implementation of restoration 
treatments? 
Although post-treatment ponderosa pine tree density was 111-256% greater than 
the projected outcome, exceeding the residual tree density may be a better outcome than 
undershooting it, because treatment units can always be re-entered for further thinning 
 
39

whereas recruiting trees takes many years.  In contrast, Ful√© et al. (2002a) reported that 
restoration thinning in a dwarf-mistletoe infected stand near Grand Canyon actually 
resulted in post-treatment pine densities lower than presettlement densities.  The average 
of 146 pines/ha includes all plots; when only thinned and burned plots were analyzed tree 
density exceeded the projected residual density by only 10-85%. Pine density averaged 
76 pines/ha (Table 3.2) on thinned and burned plots which falls within the range (43-138 
pines/ha) of post-treatment pine density found in other restoration studies (Lynch et al. 
2000, Ful√© et al. 2002a, Waltz et al. 2003).  
Despite the contract amendments to terminate oak cutting, an average of 32 
oaks/ha (0.5 m¬≤/ha) or 10% of living oaks were thinned, including 10 oaks/ha (0.25 
m¬≤/ha) greater than 15 cm dbh. Cut oaks were detected on 34% of the plots within the 
treated area and were widely dispersed, indicating that oak cutting continued after the 
decision to stop cutting oaks, probably for several reasons: First, the decision to stop 
cutting oak was made after contracts for approximately 150 ha of the treated area had 
already been agreed upon (R. Davis, pers. comm.). Second, since Gambel oak is a 
valuable fuelwood species, some additional trees were cut illegally (A. Wilkerson, pers. 
comm.). Finally, since more than two-thirds of the oak trees cut were <15 cm dbh, they 
may have been cut by operators to ensure the safe removal of ponderosa pine trees. Fewer 
than 3 trees/ha (0.2 m¬≤/ha) of pinyon or locust were cut during restoration treatments and 
no juniper trees were cut. 
With the exception of the oak cutting, the thinning prescription was designed to 
retain the living trees of non-pine species with the assumption that prescribed fire would 
thin these species. Twenty percent of the density and 80% of the basal area of Gambel 
 
40

oak died following restoration treatments, indicating that a greater proportion of larger 
oaks were killed compared to smaller ones. Two-thirds of the density and 40% of the 
basal area of New Mexico locust died, mainly because these deciduous species are 
susceptible to burning, but both species also sprout prolifically after fire (Mast 2003).  
Were presettlement trees cut or killed during treatments?  
Presettlement trees are, for all practical purposes, irreplaceable in a stand or 
landscape (DellaSalla et al. 2004) and were not intended to be cut in this project. These 
‚Äúlegacy‚Äù trees provide genetic and structural diversity to the ecosystem and take centuries 
to replace (Moore et al. 1999, DellaSalla et al. 2004). The goal of the thinning 
prescription was to avoid any cutting of presettlement trees of any species and to protect 
them during prescribed burning. BLM fire prescriptions set a goal of not exceeding 10% 
mortality of presettlement pines.  For oaks, the goal was to avoid purposely igniting 
clumps. 
Despite this, six percent of the presettlement pines/ha and 4% of the presettlement 
oaks/ha alive prior to treatment were cut. None of the five pines used in the preceding 
calculation had viable increment cores and were therefore determined to be presettlement 
in the reconstruction model based on size rather than age data, meaning that these trees 
may have been younger, black-barked, but large trees. No ponderosa pine with a 
confirmed pre-1870 center date was cut. In contrast, most of the oaks used in the above 
calculation had viable cores with a pre-1870 center date. While the cutting of any of the 
old trees is a concern, it appears that oak cutting may be a more pressing issue than pine 
cutting. 
 
41

Thirteen percent of the presettlement pines/ha died in the treated area by 2003, 
slightly exceeding the maximum allowable mortality outlined by managers. In the same 
period, 9% of the presettlement pines/ha died in the control, indicating that presettlement 
pines in the control are almost as vulnerable to mortality as those trees exposed to 
thinning and burning prescriptions.  Although mortality may be partly attributed to 
natural factors such as drought and bark beetles, a treatment-related cause of 
presettlement pine mortality is likely the heat effects of prescribed fire. Forty percent of 
presettlement pine mortality in the treated area occurred on lava soils, consistent with 
Ful√© et al.‚Äôs (2002b) finding that burning on lava soils at Mt. Trumbull caused high 
mortality of presettlement pines. Oak mortality was skewed much more sharply toward 
the treated landscape: 21% of presettlement oaks/ha died in the treated area by 2003 
compared to only 5% in the control. Recommendations to avoid burning on lava soils 
(Ful√© et al. 2002b) and to crush slash to reduce scorch (Jerman et al. 2004) are being 
incorporated for future treatment design. 
Were the projected snag and log densities achieved? 
 
 
Since large snags and downed logs provide important habitat, organic matter, and 
nutrients (Reynolds et al. 1992, Chambers 2002), the project goals were to retain at least 
75% of the snags >50 cm dbh and at least 50% of the logs >50 cm dbh following burning 
(T. Duck, pers. comm.). Two-thirds of the snags >50 cm dbh remained standing in 2003, 
below the goal, but new recruitment resulted in a 45% net increase in large snags (Table 
3.3). Eight percent of the snags >50 cm dbh were cut and 8% were consumed. Sixty-five 
percent of the logs >50 cm dbh were retained, thus, implementation goals for large logs 
were achieved. Most of the changes in snag density were due to prescribed burning but 
 
42

snags were occasionally felled for safety reasons and there was at least one documented 
incident of illegal cutting (T. Duck, pers. comm.). Changes in log density were fully 
attributed to prescribed fire. Snag and log consumption was highly variable and linked to 
adjacent fuel loads (pers. observation).  
 
Were the Treatments Effective? 
Did treatments effectively restore the historical forest structure while preserving the 
oldest trees? 
Although restoration treatments were not implemented perfectly, the desired goal 
of restoring open forest structure conditions while preserving most of the old trees has 
been achieved; however, future management will be necessary to maintain the desired 
future dynamics of the ecosystem. Total tree density was reduced by nearly half and basal 
area was reduced by more than one-third after treatment. However, density levels 
remained more than three times greater and basal area more than double the 1870 values 
(Table 3.1). Eighty-two percent of the 2003 treated area was classified as having a low 
stand density index (Figure 3.2) compared to 44% before treatment. The diameter 
distribution of ponderosa pine, while still skewed compared to reconstructed 
distributions, was reduced in the proportion of smaller trees (Figure 3.4f). Furthermore, 
density and basal area were even lower when untreated and partially treated plots were 
not included. Diameter distribution of ponderosa pine on thinned and burned plots was 
unimodally distributed, as was the case in 1870 (3.5a). Finally, although some 
presettlement trees died after treatment, the majority survived and will likely be less 
susceptible to disease and insect attack (Wallin et al. 2004). 
 
43

Were tree regeneration densities adequate and were canopy cover values reduced to 
presettlement levels? 
Current tree regeneration densities are probably more than sufficient to sustain the 
current species composition and desired forest structure, although patterns are spatially 
variable. The prolific regeneration of oak and locust could lead to deciduous dominance, 
as Barton (2002) observed following wildfire in southern Arizona.  However, subsequent 
burns are expected to continue to thin these species and unlike Barton‚Äôs (2002) site, 
where mature seed-reproducing trees were absent, at Mt. Trumbull the density of seed 
producing trees found in the treated area (7.3 >65 cm trees/ha) exceeds restoration targets 
(1-2 >65 cm trees/ha) suggested by Bailey and Covington (2002). Although ponderosa 
pine seedling regeneration was substantially reduced in the treated area, the ‚Äúsnapshot‚Äù 
inventory of 3.3 <30 cm pine seedlings/ha Table 3.4) indicates that pine seedling density 
was at least similar in magnitude to the level needed for maintenance in presettlement 
times of 3.6 seedlings/ha/decade found by Mast et al. (1999). Waltz et al. (2003) also 
noted a substantial reduction of ponderosa pine regeneration following restoration 
treatments at Mt. Trumbull. Ongoing and frequent monitoring of regeneration is 
necessary at the Mt. Trumbull landscape. 
Canopy cover values (Table 3.5) in the 2003 treated area were more consistent 
with presettlement values found near Flagstaff, Arizona of 17 percent, estimated by 
Covington and Sackett (1986) and 22 percent, estimated by White (1985). Canopy cover  
values from this study were lower than those found on Rainbow and Powell Plateaus, two 
sites at Grand Canyon National Park that have had relatively intact fire regimes and serve 
as reasonable reference sites for Mt. Trumbull (Ful√© et al. 2002c, Ful√© et al. 2003). Post-
 
44

treatment canopy cover values were consistent with those found in other ponderosa pine 
restoration studies (Ful√© et al. 2002a, Waltz et al. 2003, and Ful√© et al. 2005). Reduced 
canopy cover, tree density, and ladder fuels all have implications for changing fire 
behavior as well (Ful√© et al. 2001b); these changes have been assessed in detail elsewhere 
(see Chapter 4). 
 
Management Implications 
This study provided the first detailed information regarding the implementation 
and effectiveness of landscape-scale ecological restoration treatments in a southwestern 
ponderosa pine forest. Although the treatments were not implemented perfectly, the 
overall goal of rapidly re-establishing ecosystem characteristics similar to the reference 
characteristics was achieved. After treatment, the treated area at Mt. Trumbull was 
structurally more heterogeneous and more similar to pre-1870 conditions than the 
untreated control. From related finer-scale studies, there is reason to expect that these 
changes will result in improved ecosystem function (Covington et al. 1997, Kaye et al. 
2005), increased vigor of old and young trees (Feeney et al. 1998, Stone et al. 1999, Skov 
et al. 2004), improved resistance to disturbance agents such as bark beetles (Wallin et al. 
2004) and fire (Ful√© et al. 2001a, Chapter 4), sufficient regeneration (Bailey and 
Covington 2002), and increased productivity of herbaceous understory vegetation 
(Covington et al. 1997, Laughlin et al., in press, Moore et al., in press). However, 
treatments have also resulted in the loss of some old trees from prescribed fire activities 
(Ful√© et al. 2002b, Jerman et al. 2004) and the spread of the invasive exotic Bromus 
tectorum (C. McGlone, pers. comm.). Wildlife effects documented at Mt. Trumbull have 
 
45

been mixed to date, with beneficial and negative aspects depending on the animal species 
and scale of study (Germaine and Germaine 2002, Battin 2003, Germaine et al. 2004, 
Waltz and Covington 2004).  
Evolution of treatments over time is common in broad-scale, extended 
management projects, but it is rare to have access to detailed data from permanent plots 
to assess changes. Lessons from this study include, first, that ongoing monitoring can be 
very helpful in identifying problems. We determined relatively early that cutting of oaks 
and heat effects of burning were issues of concern. Second, even after identifying issues 
there can be an administrative lag until changes take effect. Oaks in thinning contract 
areas, for instance, were thinned even after the decision was made to stop. Third, our data 
have identified new areas on which to focus attention in restoration treatments. Old 
ponderosa pines were largely uninjured, but old oak trees had a high rate of mortality. 
Future projects should maintain pine protection while addressing oak survival more 
explicitly. Fourth, monitoring offers quantitative data on which to rest decisions about 
future treatments. The Mt. Trumbull area contains additional dense ponderosa pine 
forests. Managers planning future restoration treatments can draw upon these lessons for 
developing new treatments and modifying existing prescriptions. Finally, a key point is 
that even after nearly ten years of treatment and monitoring, the work is not finished and 
the ecosystem is not ‚Äúrestored‚Äù. Ongoing monitoring, maintenance of the surface fire 
regime, and continued management to address ecological impacts of fragmentation, 
exotic species, recreational use, etc., will remain important indefinitely.

Landscape-Scale Changes in Canopy Fuels and Potential Fire Behavior 
Following Ponderosa Pine Restoration Treatments 
 
Abstract 
We evaluated canopy fuels and potential fire behavior changes following landscape-scale 
forest restoration treatments in a ponderosa pine forest at Mt. Trumbull, Arizona. The 
goal of the project was to restore historical forest structure by thinning and burning, 
thereby reducing canopy fuels and minimizing the potential for active crown fire. We 
measured 117 permanent plots before (1996/97) and after (2003) treatments. The plots 
were evenly distributed across the landscape and represented an area of approximately 
1200 ha, about half of which was an untreated control. We compared canopy fuel 
estimates using three different methods to assess whether fire behavior modeling outputs 
were sensitive to the choice of canopy fuel equation. Restoration treatments decreased 
canopy fuel load (CFL) by 43-50% from 7.7-18.3 Mg/ha to 4.4-9.1 Mg/ha (the range of 
values reflects the different canopy fuel equations) and decreased canopy bulk density 
(CBD) by 42-61% from 0.038-0.172 kg/m¬≥ to 0.022-0.67 kg/m¬≥ in the treated area, while 
slight increases occurred in the control. Canopy base height (CBH) averaged 0.4 m 
higher in the treated area than the control and 1.1 m higher when unburned plots within 
the treated area were excluded from analysis. We applied two simulation models to 
estimate potential fire behavior: FlamMap and Nexus. These models differ in several 
important features but predicted outcomes were consistent; under extreme drought and 
 
63

wind conditions, the proportion of the landscape susceptible to active crown fire and the 
mean patch size of these areas were both reduced in the treated area. In contrast, the 
models show little change in active crown fire susceptibility in the control over the same 
time period. We conclude that the restoration treatments have successfully addressed the 
project goals of reducing canopy fuels and the potential for active crown fire.

Introduction 
The increase of stand-replacing crown fires in ecosystems that historically 
supported frequent surface fire regimes is a major ecological concern (Covington 2000, 
Allen et al. 2002). Many restoration and fuel treatment projects have been implemented 
throughout the western United States to restore natural ecosystem structure and function 
and to reduce the threat of stand-replacing crown fires (Scott 1998, Lynch et al. 2000, 
Ful√© et al. 2001a, Stratton 2004). Such studies that examine treatment effects on fire 
behavior or severity can be classified into three categories: experimental, observational, 
and modeling. Experimental studies test fire behavior by purposely igniting fires and 
examining the effects during and after the burn. Although researchers have deliberately 
ignited crown fires to study their properties in certain isolated settings (Alexander et al. 
2004), most experimental studies are focused on effects of relatively low-intensity fires 
(Weaver 1957, Covington et al. 1997, Ful√© et al. 2002a) because intentionally lighting 
 
64

large, stand-replacing crown fires is difficult to justify. Observational studies examine the 
effects of wildfires after they occur. Pollet and Omi (2002), Martinson and Omi (2003), 
Graham (2003), and Cram and Baker (2003) showed that treated stands generally showed 
lower fire severity, although treatments did not necessarily preclude severe burning or 
prevent the passage of landscape-scale crown fires. Following the 2002 Rodeo-Chediski 
fire in Arizona, Finney et al. (2005) used satellite imagery and Strom (2005) used ground 
data to show that burning and/or cutting + burning treatments substantially reduced fire 
severity. Such observational approaches are essential for measuring real-world effects of 
treatments, but the scope of inference of the approach remains limited by lack of pre-fire 
data, randomization, and replication. The final technique, fire behavior modeling, is the 
most removed from actual fire behavior but the most flexible for testing alternative 
scenarios of stand development, treatments, or weather conditions. Various studies have 
used models to evaluate potential fire behavior after restoration or fuel treatments at 
scales ranging from stands (Stephens 1998, Ful√© et al. 2001a & 2001b, Ful√© et al. 2002a, 
Faiella 2005) to landscapes (Fiedler and Keegan 2003, Ful√© et al. 2004, Stratton 2004). 
 
Wildland fire is classified into ground (sub-surface), surface, or crown categories 
based on where in the fuel strata burning occurs (Pyne et al. 1996). Crown fires are 
further subdivided into three types: passive, active, and independent (Van Wagner 1977). 
Passive crown fire, or torching, occurs when fire transitions from the surface and ignites 
the lower canopy.  The windspeed at which torching is initiated, the ‚Äútorching index,‚Äù is 
largely a function of canopy base height. Active crown fires burn the entire 
surface/canopy fuel complex, depending primarily on the bulk density of foliage and fine 
twigs in the canopy. Independent crown fires, or active crown fires that do not rely on 
 
65

surface fire, are extremely rare and not considered further here. Since passive and active 
crown fire behavior are linked to different canopy fuel variables, it is possible to 
encounter a situation where passive crown fire is not predicted to occur, due to a high 
canopy base height, but active crown fire could occur, due to high canopy bulk density. 
Scott and Reinhardt (2001) described this hysteresis as a ‚Äúconditional‚Äù surface fire; active 
crown fire could occur on the condition that canopy burning entered the stand from 
outside, otherwise surface fire would occur. 
Canopy fuels are a crucial input for models that predict crown fire but they are rarely 
measured directly. Brown (1978) provided allometric equations developed in the northern 
Rocky Mountains for ponderosa pine that have been widely applied. In Arizona, Ful√© et 
al. (2001a, 2004) applied locally developed allometric equations that predicted less 
canopy fuel, and hence lower canopy bulk density, than would have been predicted by 
Brown‚Äôs (1978) equations. Cruz et al. (2003) developed stand-level equations to predict 
canopy fuels based on tree density and basal area. Because these three approaches differ, 
the selection of a canopy fuel modeling approach may affect fire behavior model results. 
Deterministic semi-empirical fire behavior models based on Rothermel‚Äôs (1972) 
surface fire model, coupled with canopy initiation and spread models, are widely used in 
fire behavior analysis. FARSITE, a GIS-based system, uses terrain, fuels, and weather 
inputs to simulate the growth, spread, and behavior of wildland fires (Finney 1998). The 
variant FlamMap, adapted for assessing fuel hazards, uses most of the same inputs as 
FARSITE but predicts potential fire behavior simultaneously for each individual pixel on 
the raster landscape (Finney, in preparation). Nexus, another hazard model, uses plot- or 
stand-level data to predict potential fire behavior (Scott and Reinhardt 1999, 2001).  
 
66

FlamMap and Nexus differ in crown fire outputs provided, with FlamMap simulating 
only passive and active crown fire, while Nexus also provides estimates of conditional 
surface fire. 
 Initiated in 1995, the Mt. Trumbull Ponderosa Pine Ecosystem Restoration Project 
aimed to restore forest structure and ecosystem processes within the historical range of 
variability that occurred in the area prior to 1870 (Moore et al. 1999, Chapter 3). 
Additional goals of the project were to reduce fuel loads, disrupt fuel continuity, and 
reduce the risk of stand-replacing crown fires by implementing landscape-scale 
mechanical thinning followed by prescribed surface fire (Moore et al. 2003). In this 
study, we used fire behavior models to evaluate the effect of landscape-scale restoration 
treatments on crown fire hazard. Our goals were to: 1) compare three common canopy 
fuel estimation approaches using data collected in this study; 2) compare the output from 
FlamMap and Nexus; and 3) apply these analyses to assess the effectiveness of 
landscape-scale restoration treatments on reducing crown fire hazard. 
 
Methods 
Study Area 
 
Mt. Trumbull is located in the Uinkaret Mountains on the Arizona Strip in the 
Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument and managed by the Bureau of Land 
Management (BLM). Vegetation in the study area (elevation 2,000 to 2,250 m) is 
comprised of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson var. scopulorum 
Engelm.) and Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.), with Utah juniper (Juniperus 
 
67

osteosperma [Torr.] Little), pinyon (Pinus edulis Engelm.), New Mexico locust (Robinia 
neomexicana Gray) and several shrubs occurring throughout the area. Soils are derived 
from basaltic parent material. The two main soil types found in the study area are the 
Wutoma-Lozinta complex which consists of ashy-skeletal over fragmental or cindery, 
mixed, mesic Vitrandic Haplustepts, and Sponiker soils, classified as fine, smectitic, 
mesic Pachic Argiustolls (Natural Resources Conservation Service 2004). 
Native Americans, who named the mountains the Uinkarets or ‚Äúregion of pines,‚Äù 
inhabited the Mt. Trumbull area for millennia before it was settled by Euro-Americans 
circa 1870 (Altschul and Fairley 1989). Records from fire-scarred trees suggest that 
relatively open forest structure conditions were maintained by a frequent fire regime prior 
to Euro-American settlement in 1870 (Waltz and Ful√© 1998, Heinlein et al. 1999, Ful√©, 
unpublished data). 
Annual precipitation at Nixon Flats (elevation 1,981 m, approximately 3 km NE 
of study site) averaged 47.2 cm with an average January temperature of 1¬∞C and an 
average July temperature of 21¬∞C between January 1992 and December 2003 (Western 
Regional Climate Center 2005). Annual precipitation at Mt. Logan (elevation 2,195 m, 
approximately 2 km SW of study site) averaged 31.2 cm with an average January 
temperature of -1¬∞C and an average July temperature of 20¬∞C between January 1986 and 
December 2003 (Western Regional Climate Center 2005). Most precipitation occurs in 
winter and during summer monsoon storms; spring and fall are relatively dry.  
 
About half of the approximately 1200 ha study landscape (Figure 4.1) is a 
contiguous, ‚Äúuntreated‚Äù, densely-treed area (hereafter ‚Äúcontrol area‚Äù or ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù). The 
other half, hereafter ‚Äútreated area‚Äù, is adjacent to the control. Restoration treatments were 
 
68

carried out between 1996 and 2003 (Moore et al. 2003) and are described in detail in 
chapter 3. Some untreated areas remain within the treated area boundary, such as controls 
for other experiments, or operationally inaccessible areas, ranging from approximately 10 
to 40 hectares. 
 
Field Methods 
 
Prior to treatment in 1996 and 1997, we installed 117 permanent plots on a 300 
meter grid (Figure 4.1) throughout the Mt. Trumbull landscape as part of a before-after-
control-impact (BACI) study design (Stewart-Oaten and Bence 2001); all plots (55 
control, 61 treated, 1 partially treated, excluded from analysis) were remeasured in the 
summer of 2003. The plots were adapted from the National Park Service‚Äôs Fire 
Monitoring plots (Reeberg 1995, NPS 2003), with modifications to collect 
dendroecological data for reconstruction of historical forest structure. Sampling plots 
were 0.1 ha (20 x 50 m) in size, oriented with the 50-m sides uphill-downhill to maximize 
sampling of variability along the elevational gradient and to permit correction of the plot 
area for slope. 
Overstory trees, those larger than 15 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were 
measured on the entire plot (1000 m2) and trees between 2.5-15 cm dbh (pole-sized trees) 
were measured on one quarter-plot (250 m2); all trees were tagged and species and dbh 
were recorded. Total height was measured for pole-sized trees but not for overstory trees 
during the pre-treatment measurement; total height and crown base height were measured 
for all trees in 2003. All overstory and pole-sized trees were also mapped within the 1000 
m¬≤ plot. Ponderosa pine trees were considered potentially presettlement if dbh ‚â•37.5 cm 
 
69

or if bark was yellowed (White 1985). Trees of all other species were considered 
potentially presettlement if dbh ‚â•17 cm dbh (Barger and Ffolliott 1972). Tree cores were 
collected at 40 cm above ground level for all potentially presettlement trees and for a 
random 10% subsample of all other live trees ‚â•2.5 cm to determine past size, as 
described below. Canopy cover measured by vertical projection (Ganey and Block 1994) 
was recorded at 3 m intervals along the two 50-m sidelines of each plot for a total of 32 
points per plot. Post-treatment measurements on plots coincided as closely as possible to 
the original day and month of the original measurement. 
 
Reconstruction Methods 
Tree increment cores were surfaced and crossdated (Stokes and Smiley 1968) using 
locally developed tree-ring chronologies. Rings were counted on cores that could not be 
crossdated, especially young trees and junipers. Additional years to the center were 
estimated using a pith locator (concentric circles matched to the curvature and density of 
the inner rings) for cores without a pith (Applequist 1958). 
We reconstructed forest structure using dendroecological methods described in 
detail by Ful√© et al. (1997) and Mast et al. (1999). We reconstructed diameter for all 
living trees by subtracting the radial growth since 1870 measured on increment cores and 
estimated death date of dead trees based on tree condition class using diameter dependent 
snag decomposition rates (Thomas et al. 1979, Rogers et al. 1984). We performed a 
sensitivity analysis by using the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile decomposition rates to 
examine the effect of slower or faster decomposition on estimates of death date and 1870 
 
70

structure. Less than ¬±1% change in reconstructed forest structure occurred during this 
analysis, so the 50th percentile reconstruction was used in this study.  
Forest structure reconstruction methods were based on the assumption that 
evidence of all structures (i.e., snags, logs, stumps, stump holes) present in 1870 was 
intact, located, and correctly identified during the pre-treatment inventory. The 
probability that this occurred was relatively high given the absence of fire combined with 
the semi-arid environment limiting the decomposition of conifer wood (Ful√© et al. 1997, 
Mast et al. 1999, Waltz et al. 2003), and because field crews were trained to identify the 
presence and species of presettlement structures. Moore et al. (2004) found that 
reconstruction field techniques in a similar environment and forest type were reliable 
within ¬±10% of tree density over ~90 years. 
 
Fire Behavior Model Inputs  
 
We used the following inputs for fire behavior modeling with both FlamMap 
(Finney, in preparation) and the Nexus Fire Behavior and Hazard Assessment System 
(Scott and Reinhardt 1999, 2001). Fuel model 9 (Anderson 1982), was used for all 
simulations. Fire weather extremes representing the 97th percentile of low fuel moisture 
for June from 34 years of data on the Kaibab National Forest (Tusayan weather station) 
were used in all simulations as described in Ful√© et al. (2002a). These are very dry and 
windy conditions, representing the type of severe weather under which uncontrollable 
crown fires spread. 
Canopy fuel load (CFL) and canopy bulk density (CBD) were estimated using 
three methods. The first method, described in detail in Ful√© et al. (2001a), estimated CFL 
 
71

using locally developed allometric equations for foliage and fine twigs of ponderosa pine 
(Ful√© et al. 2001a), Gambel oak (Clary and Teidemann 1986), and pinyon and juniper 
(Grier et al. 1992); oak equations were also used for locust. The second method used 
equations from Brown (1978) to calculate foliage and fine twigs for ponderosa pine, plus 
the non-pine-species equations used in the first method. In both of the first two methods, 
canopy volume (CV) was estimated using averages of maximum tree height (top of 
canopy) and crown base height (bottom of canopy). Canopy bulk density was calculated 
as CFL divided by CV for both methods. CV in 1870 was estimated using regression 
equations developed with data from Rainbow Plateau, Grand Canyon, Arizona, a nearby 
never-harvested reference site (Ful√© et al. 2002b). The third method used equations from 
Cruz et al. (2003) to estimate CFL and CBD directly from tree density and basal area. We 
used the lowest quintile values (lowest 20%) of crown base heights on each plot as a 
model input to better represent actual conditions (Ful√© et al. 2001a, 2002a). Foliar 
moisture content (FMC) was 80% unless noted otherwise. 
FlamMap required additional GIS inputs, including elevation, slope, aspect, and 
canopy cover. The three topographic layers were derived from a digital elevational model 
(DEM). Canopy cover was calculated from plot data for 1996/97 and 2003 and was 
estimated using Rainbow Plateau regressions for 1870. Landscape patterns for each input 
layer were estimated using negative exponential interpolation between plots with 10 m 
resolution. We used windspeeds of 10 through 70 km/h, in 10 km/h increments. Wind 
azimuth was held constant at 225¬∞ to match the prevailing southwest wind direction at 
Mt. Trumbull during fire season. Each FlamMap run was saved as an ASCII file and then 
converted to raster files. The Patch Analyst (Version 3.0) extension for ArcView 3.3 
 
72

(ESRI, Redlands, CA) was used to calculate percentage of the landscape and mean patch 
size based on the number of pixels in each fire type (i.e., surface, passive, or active). For 
Nexus, individual plot slope values were entered instead of DEM data. Nexus outputs 
were interpolated across the plot grid in ArcView to create maps. Percentage of the 
landscape was calculated based on percent of plots in each fire type. 
 
Results 
Canopy Fuels 
 
Canopy fuel load (CFL) and canopy bulk density (CBD) values were relatively 
low over the entire study area in 1870, compared to later values (Table 4.1). Depending 
on which equations were used, CFL increased by 220-343% and CBD increased by 279-
648% between 1870 and 1996/97 across the entire landscape. By 2003, treatment lowered 
CFL by 42% (Ful√© et al 2001a), 48% (Brown 1978), and 61% (Cruz et al. 2003) and 
CBD by 43% (Ful√©), 50% (Brown) and 50% (Cruz) in the treated area compared to slight 
increases in the control (Table 4.1). Canopy base height (CBH) was not measured prior to 
treatment, but after treatment CBH averaged 0.4 m higher in the treated area than the 
control and 1.1 m higher when unburned plots within the treated area were excluded from 
analysis (Table 4.2). Ponderosa pine CBH was higher in the treated area (4.8 m) than the 
control (3.7 m). Low quintile CBH was lowest in the control, higher in the overall treated 
area, and highest on thinned and burned plots (Table 4.2).

Potential Fire Behavior 
FlamMap and Nexus modeling results for the three CBD levels showed that 
crown fire activity was correlated with CBD when modeled with constant windspeeds 
and FMC (Figure 4.2). The FlamMap simulations were very sensitive to CBD, showing 
no active crown fire at all when the lowest values (equations from Ful√© et al. 2001a) were 
used and minimal active crown fire when intermediate values (equations from Brown 
1978) were used. Therefore, we restricted the following analysis to results from the two 
fire behavior models using the highest CBD values, based on equations from Cruz et al. 
(2003). 
FlamMap predicted that active crown fire would not occur within the study area 
in 1870 even with 70 km/h windspeeds (Figure 4.3). While only 5% of the 1870 
landscape would support passive crown fire with 10 km/h winds, 64% of the landscape 
would support passive crown fire when windspeed was increased to 70 km/h (Figure 3.2). 
Mean patch size of areas that could support passive crown fire in 1870 increased from 2.1 
ha with 10 km/h windspeeds to 52.9 ha with 70 km/h windspeeds.  
In contrast to the 1870 condition, by 1996/97 areas that could support the 
initiation of active crown fire began to occur on the landscape with winds as low as 10 
km/h (Figure 4.3). FlamMap predicted that 18% of the pre-treatment (1996/97) landscape 
would support passive crown fire even with 10 km/h windspeeds. When windspeeds were 
increased to 70 km/h, nearly 90% of the landscape was classified as either passive or 
active (see bar graph, Figure 4.3). In this scenario, FlamMap predicted that 13% of the 
landscape would burn with surface fire. However, because these areas had high CBH but 
also high CBD values, they likely would have been classified as conditional surface fire 
 
74

if FlamMap had this capability.  Mean patch size of areas that could support passive 
crown fires increased from 3.0 ha with 10 km/h windspeeds to 4.6 ha with 70 km/h 
windspeeds in the pre-treatment landscape. Mean patch size of areas that could initiate 
active crown fires increased from 0.1 ha with 10 km/h windspeeds to 15.1 ha with 70 
km/h windspeeds in 1996/97. 
 
The 2003 FlamMap output (70 km/h windspeeds) indicated that the percent of the 
landscape susceptible to active crown fire initiation was reduced from 46% to less than 
5% in the treated area; however, the model predicted that 69% of the treated area would 
still be able to support passive crown fire (Figure 4.3). Mean patch size of areas that 
could initiate active crown fires decreased from 14.9 hectares to 2.7 hectares in the 
treated area when modeled with 70 km/h windspeeds. In the control, the percent of the 
landscape susceptible to active crown fire initiation increased from 43% to 44% between 
1996/97 and 2003 and mean patch size of areas that could initiate active crown fires 
increased from 14.4 ha to 29.5 ha when modeled using 70 km/h windspeeds. FlamMap 
predicted that 26% of the control would not support passive crown fire or initiate active 
crown fire when modeled using 70 km/h windspeeds; however, these areas would likely 
be classified as conditional surface fire if FlamMap could predict this situation (Figure 
4.3). 
 
Using Nexus to model potential fire behavior with the same model inputs used 
with FlamMap, we predicted that some active crown fire would occur within the study 
area in 1870 with windspeeds greater than 50 km/h, with up to 17% of the landscape 
supporting active crown fire when modeled with 70 km/h windspeeds (Figure 4.4). Like 
FlamMap, Nexus predicted that approximately two-thirds of the 1870 landscape would 
 
75

support passive crown fire with 70 km/h winds. Nexus predicted that 44% of the pre-
treatment landscape would support passive crown fire and five percent would support 
active crown fire when modeled with 10 km/h windspeeds. When windspeeds were 
increased to 70 km/h, 80% of the pre-treatment landscape would support active crown 
fire. The 2003 Nexus output (70 km/h windspeeds) indicated that the percent of the 
landscape that could initiate or sustain active crown fire (i.e., conditional surface fire) 
was reduced from 82% to 48% in the treated area, however, the model predicted that less 
than 4% of the treated area would support surface fire. In the 2003 landscape, torching 
index (the windspeed necessary to initiate passive crown fire) and crowning index (the 
windspeed necessary to sustain active crown fire) were both greater in the treated area 
compared to the control (Figure 4.5). In the 2003 treated area, average torching index was 
three times greater and average crowning index was more than double pre-treatment 
levels (Table 4.3). Crown percent burned, rate of spread, heat per unit area, and average 
flame lengths were all reduced in the treated area when modeled using 2003 conditions. 
 
Discussion 
Canopy Fuels 
Canopy fuel values are essential model inputs for both FlamMap and Nexus and it 
is important that canopy characteristics are estimated as accurately as possible (Scott and 
Reinhardt 2001). Values for CFL and CBD were highly variable depending on which 
equations were used (Table 4.1). Brown‚Äôs (1978) equations always produced the highest 
value for average CFL, Ful√© et al.‚Äôs (2001a) estimate was always lowest, and Cruz et al.‚Äôs 
 
76

(2003) equation always produced values between Ful√© et al. and Brown‚Äôs CFL estimates. 
Cruz‚Äôs CFL estimates were similar to Ful√©‚Äôs and exceeded them by only 0.1-12%; 
whereas, Brown‚Äôs estimates exceeded Ful√©‚Äôs estimates by 79-163%. For CBD, Ful√©‚Äôs 
equation again produced the lowest estimate, but Cruz‚Äôs estimate was highest and 
Brown‚Äôs estimate was intermediate in all but one instance (1870, Treated) (Table 4.1). 
None of the CBD estimates were similar; Brown‚Äôs estimates exceeded Ful√©‚Äôs estimates 
by 184-268% and Cruz‚Äôs estimates exceeded Ful√©‚Äôs estimates by 153-491%. The percent 
change of CFL and CBD between time periods was also highly variable depending on 
which equation was used. For CFL, Ful√©‚Äôs estimates generally had the lowest and 
Brown‚Äôs estimates generally had the highest percent change between time periods. Using 
the 1870 to 1996/97 CFL increase in the control as an example, Ful√©‚Äôs equation estimated 
a 187% increase compared to an increase of 315% by Brown and an increase of 208% by 
Cruz. For CBD, Ful√©‚Äôs estimates had the lowest and Cruz‚Äôs estimates had the highest 
percent change between time periods. 
Which equations should be used in southwestern ponderosa pine forests? Direct 
measurement of canopy fuels has recently been completed on a dense ponderosa pine plot 
(10-m radius) near Flagstaff, Arizona, approximately 160 km southeast of our study area 
(Scott and Reinhardt 2005). Prior to treatment, the plot‚Äôs CFL was 9.3 Mg/ha and CBD 
was 0.17 kg/m3; removal of 75% of the original basal area by thinning from below 
reduced these values to 2.7 Mg/ha and 0.057 kg/m3 (Scott and Reinhardt 2005). These 
values for CFL are similar to those generated by the Ful√© and the Cruz equations in the 
untreated 1996/97 landscape (7.7 to 9.8 Mg/ha, respectively; values with the Brown 
equations were much higher: 18.3 to 23.1 Mg/ha [Table 4.1]). In contrast, however, Scott 
 
77

and Reinhardt‚Äôs (2005) CBD measurements were most similar to our CBD estimates 
using the Cruz‚Äôs equation (0.172-0.226 kg/m3). Post-treatment values were comparable to 
Scott and Reinhardt‚Äôs (2005) thinned values following the same pattern as in the 
untreated forest.  
Given the variety of ways in which these equations were developed, it would be 
difficult to speculate about the reasons for the differences. Assuming that Scott and 
Reinhardt‚Äôs (2005) measured data are the most accurate available in northern Arizona, we 
conclude that the locally developed allometric equations presented by Ful√© et al. (2001a) 
are appropriate estimates of the actual available canopy fuel biomass. However, the 
approach used by Ful√© et al. (2001a) to calculate CFL by CV assumes that canopy fuels 
are evenly distributed throughout the canopy volume. Scott and Reinhardt (2005) 
illustrate that CBD varies through the canopy and they report the peak values, arguing 
that maximum CBD is the most important factor in assessing crown fire spread. If this 
logic is applied, then it would be appropriate to use the CBD equation presented by Cruz 
et al. (2003) in southwestern ponderosa pine forests because Cruz‚Äôs equation produces 
CBD values closest to those reported by Scott and Reinhardt (2005). As canopy fuel 
measurement grows more sophisticated, estimates will become increasingly accurate. For 
now, however, it may be advisable for analysts to use several approaches, as we did in 
this study, in order to understand the sensitivity of outputs to changes in inputs. 
 
Potential Fire Behavior 
Fire behavior model outputs should be interpreted with caution. The purpose of 
modeling fire behavior was not to accurately estimate the behavior of an actual fire, but 
 
78

rather to use the output as a means of comparing potential fire behavior between the three 
time periods as well as between the control and treated areas in 2003 over a range of 
windspeeds. There are two major differences between the two models. First, in FlamMap, 
the model inputs are interpolated across the plot grid and results are calculated for each 
10 x 10 m cell, whereas, in Nexus, inputs are calculated for each plot and outputs are 
interpolated across the landscape. Second, Nexus accounts for the situation known as the 
conditional surface fire (Scott and Reinhardt 2001); FlamMap does not. 
 
We initially modeled fire behavior using FlamMap because it incorporated 
detailed topographical information (elevation, aspect, and slope) for each 10 by 10 m cell. 
Since our intent was to evaluate restoration treatment effectiveness on crown fire hazard, 
we used Cruz et al.‚Äôs (2003) CBD because Ful√© et al.‚Äôs (2001a) and Brown‚Äôs (1978) CBD 
produced little crown fire even under the most extreme conditions in FlamMap (Figure 
4.2). Nexus was less sensitive to CBD and produced active crown fire even with the 
lowest CBD values estimated using the equations from Ful√© et al. (2001a). Cruz et al.‚Äôs 
(2003) equation produced the highest percentage of active crown fire in both models. 
 
In general, FlamMap and Nexus produced similar results: relatively low crown 
fire hazard in 1870, a marked increase in crown fire hazard by 1996/97, and decreasing 
crown fire hazard in the treated area by 2003 with little change in the control (Figure 4.3 
and Figure 4.4). With FlamMap, increases in windspeed produced gradual increases in 
active crown fire, whereas with Nexus active crown fire increased more dramatically at a 
threshold windspeed of approximately 30-40 kph (see bar graphs in Figure 4.3 and Figure 
4.4). Overall, Nexus always predicted more passive and active crown fire compared to 
FlamMap when modeled under the same conditions. For example, comparing the 1870 
 
79

output for the two models, with 30 kph windspeeds, Nexus predicted that the percent of 
the landscape classified as passive crown fire was more than two times greater than 
FlamMap‚Äôs prediction; similarly, with 70 kph windspeeds, FlamMap did not predict any 
active crown fire while Nexus predicted about 20%. 
 
The most significant difference between the two models is that Nexus accounts 
for conditional surface fire, whereas FlamMap does not. In FlamMap, a pixel cannot be 
classified as active crown fire unless it is first classified as passive crown fire (Finney, in 
preparation), thus, the maps produced by FlamMap only show areas that can initiate 
active crown fire. Therefore, if torching index exceeded the crowning index for a given 
cell and could sustain active crown fire, FlamMap would consider it surface fire even 
though it should be considered conditional surface fire. FlamMap‚Äôs inability to predict 
conditional surface fire was demonstrated by the large area in the 2003 control classified 
as surface fire even when modeled with extreme weather conditions (Figure 4.3). Based 
on plot data and photos, it was evident that this area had abundant canopy fuels that could 
sustain an already burning active crown fire, but because of insufficient ladder fuels (i.e., 
high CBH), would be unable to initiate active burning even with extreme weather 
conditions. We suspected that this area would have been classified as conditional surface 
fire if FlamMap had the ability to do so. The Nexus output revealed that torching index 
exceeded the crowning index for the plots in this area, thus, Nexus classified this area as 
active when modeled with 70 km/h windspeeds (Figure 4.4). 
 
The final objective in this study, and perhaps the most important, was to use 
FlamMap and Nexus to evaluate the effectiveness of restoration treatments on crown fire 
hazard. Both models predicted a range of variability in fire behavior throughout the 
 
80

landscape, but both consistently predicted reduced crown fire hazard in the treated area 
compared to pre-treatment levels and compared to the control (Figure 4.3 and Figure 4.4). 
Although both models predicted large areas of passive crown fire in the 2003 treated area 
with high windspeeds, areas classified as active crown fire were limited to two small 
patches. Furthermore, the patterns observed in the 2003 treated area resembled the fire 
behavior predicted for the 1870 landscape for both models. Increased torching and 
crowning indices due to treatment (Table 4.3) were consistent with results from previous 
research on similar restoration treatments in northern Arizona (Ful√© et al. 2001a, Ful√© et 
al. 2001b, Ful√© et al. 2002a, Faiella 2005). The model results were also consistent with 
on-the-ground fire behavior observations. In April 2000, the ‚ÄúEB3 Escape Fire‚Äù burned 
as active crown fire in an untreated control unit (Waltz et al. 2003) directly adjacent to 
our study site. 
 
Management Implications 
 
Many researchers have used models to estimate canopy fuels and predict potential 
fire behavior, but few studies compare the results of more than one model. All models are 
simplifications of reality and are based on certain assumptions. We suggest that fire 
behavior analysts use multiple modeling approaches when possible to better support their 
findings. Inclusion of conditional surface fire classification would be a useful addition to 
the FlamMap model. 
This study provided the first evaluation of the effectiveness of landscape-scale 
restoration treatments on canopy fuels and crown fire hazard for the Mt. Trumbull 
landscape. Although canopy fuel estimates and fire behavior predictions varied 
 
81

depending on which models were used, all modeling scenarios resulted in substantially 
lowered canopy fuels and crown fire hazard in the treated area.  
The Mt. Trumbull ecosystem will never be ‚Äúfireproofed‚Äù. Some level of crown 
fire will likely occur in the future, particularly in untreated areas. Even within treated 
areas, passive crown fire may occur, especially during dry years. However, the overall 
management objective of reducing canopy fuels and crown fire hazard was achieved in 
treated areas. Maintenance of the surface fire regime will be vital to retaining open forest 
conditions and relatively low crown fire hazard into the future. The Mt. Trumbull area 
contains additional dense ponderosa pine forests. If these areas remain untreated, stand-
replacing crown fires could cause large patches with high tree mortality which could 
potentially limit conifer regeneration (Barclay et al. 2004). Severe fires may even result 
in ecosystem conversion to shrubfields or grasslands (Savage and Mast 2005, Strom 
2005). The Mt. Trumbull ponderosa pine ecosystem is not yet ‚Äúrestored‚Äù. However, 
restoration treatments have been successful at substantially reducing crown fire hazard 
and creating more sustainable forest conditions. Managers should continue to model 
crown fire hazard and monitor on-the-ground fire behavior as additional areas within the 
project are treated.

Figure 4.2 FlamMap and Nexus output modeling results show that FlamMap is not 
responsive to the lower CBD values produced using Ful√© et al.‚Äôs (2001a) equations. Cruz 
et al.‚Äôs (2003) equations produce the highest percentage of active crown fire throughout 
the landscape in both models. Model inputs were 70 km/h windspeeds, 80% foliar 
moisture content, low quintile CBH, 2003 conditions. The control is in the lower half of

Conclusions 
 
Summary 
The objective of this research was to determine if landscape-scale restoration 
treatments at Mt. Trumbull were implemented as intended and if they effectively restored 
historical forest structure conditions while allowing for the reintroduction of surface fire. 
This study provided the first detailed information regarding the implementation of 
landscape-scale ecological restoration treatments in a southwestern ponderosa pine 
ecosystem. Evaluation of treatment implementation is a vital component of the adaptive 
management process. It would be difficult to justify altering treatment prescriptions or 
continuing the current management approach if we were unsure whether the original 
prescriptions were followed. This study also assessed whether restoration treatments were 
a valid means of attaining the ultimate project goals set out by managers and researchers. 
The success of treatment implementation was variable. Most of the area originally 
planned for restoration was treated in some manner by 2003; however, only 70% received 
the full planned treatment (thin and burn). Although pine density decreased significantly 
over the treated area, post-treatment levels were 111-256% above the projected density. 
Pine density exceeded the projected density by only 10-85% in areas that received the 
intended treatment (thin and burn). Despite contract amendments to terminate oak 
cutting, some oaks were still cut due to administrative lag. Eighty percent of the 
presettlement pines alive prior to treatment remained alive by 2003 in the treated area; 
 
95

however, 4% of the presettlement oaks were cut and 10% died. One-third of large snags 
were lost, falling below the snag retention target, but new large snags were recruited, 
resulting in a net increase in snag density over the landscape. Implementation goals for 
large logs were achieved. 
Restoration treatments were an effective means of attaining the overall project 
goal of restoring more open forest structure conditions while preserving the majority of 
the presettlement trees. Although density and basal area levels were more than double the 
1870 values, 82% of the treated area was classified as having low stand density index 
(SDI) in 2003 compared to 44% before treatment. The diameter distribution of ponderosa 
pine, while still skewed compared to reconstructed distributions, was reduced in the 
proportion of smaller trees. Current regeneration densities were more than sufficient to 
sustain the current species composition and desired forest structure. 
Restoration treatments were also effective at reducing canopy fuels and crown fire 
hazard. Canopy fuel load (CFL) and canopy bulk density (CBD) were both decreased 
substantially in the treated area, while slight increases occurred in the control. Canopy 
base height (CBH) was slightly higher in the treated area than in the control. Predicted 
outcomes were consistent between the two fire behavior models (FlamMap and Nexus): 
under extreme drought and wind conditions, crown fire hazard was reduced in the treated 
area. In contrast, the models show little change in active crown fire hazard in the control 
over the same time period. We conclude that the restoration treatments have successfully 
addressed the overall project goal of restoring forest structure and ecosystem processes 
within the historical range of natural variability and have reduced canopy fuels and crown 
fire hazard.

Management Implications 
The Mt. Trumbull Ponderosa Pine Ecosystem Restoration Project serves as an 
excellent example of collaboration. In addition to developing a dedicated pursuit to 
restore the degraded Mt. Trumbull ecosystem, managers and researchers have followed 
through with a strong commitment to monitor ecological responses to restoration 
treatments. This study represents the first landscape-scale evaluation in the adaptive 
management process. Although restoration treatments were not implemented perfectly, 
the overall goal of re-establishing a sustainable and functioning ecosystem was achieved. 
After treatment, the restored area at Mt. Trumbull was structurally more heterogeneous 
and more similar to pre-1870 conditions than the untreated control. Although the 
treatments implemented were different than originally planned, the diversity of 
treatments created a variety of ecosystem conditions which will benefit a wide range of 
plants and animals as well as humans. From related finer-scale studies, there is reason to 
expect that these changes will result in improved ecosystem function (Covington et al. 
1997, Kaye et al. 2005), increased vigor of old and young trees (Feeney et al. 1998, Stone 
et al. 1999, Skov et al. 2004), improved resistance to disturbance agents such as bark 
beetles (Wallin et al. 2004) and fire (Ful√© et al. 2001, Chapter 4), sufficient regeneration 
(Bailey and Covington 2002), and increased productivity of herbaceous understory 
vegetation (Covington et al. 1997, Laughlin et al., in press, Moore et al., in press). 
However, treatments have also resulted in the loss of some old trees from prescribed fire 
activities (Ful√© et al. 2002, Jerman et al. 2004) and the spread of the invasive exotic 
Bromus tectorum (C. McGlone, pers. comm.). Wildlife effects documented at Mt. 
Trumbull have been mixed to date, with beneficial and negative aspects depending on the 
 
97

animal species and scale of study (Germaine and Germaine 2002, Battin 2003, Germaine 
et al. 2004, Waltz and Covington 2004).  
Evolution of treatments over time is common in broad-scale, extended 
management projects, but it is rare to have access to detailed data from permanent plots 
to assess changes. Lessons from this study include, first, that ongoing monitoring can be 
very helpful in identifying problems. We determined relatively early that cutting of oaks 
and heat effects of burning were issues of concern. Second, even after identifying issues 
there can be an administrative lag until changes take effect. Oaks in thinning contract 
areas, for instance, were thinned even after the decision was made to stop. Third, our data 
have identified new areas on which to focus attention in restoration treatments. Old 
ponderosa pines were largely uninjured, but old oak trees had a high rate of mortality. 
Future projects should maintain pine protection while addressing oak survival more 
explicitly. Fourth, monitoring offers quantitative data on which to rest decisions about 
future treatments. Managers planning future restoration treatments can draw upon these 
lessons for developing new treatments and modifying existing prescriptions. This study 
underscores the importance of including a comprehensive, long-term monitoring plan in 
proposed resource management projects so that implementation and effectiveness of 
treatments can be evaluated. Such extensive monitoring may not be feasible due to 
resource limitations. Therefore, managers should make every possible effort to 
incorporate some level of monitoring into projects so that prescriptions can be evaluated 
and altered if necessary. 
The Mt. Trumbull ecosystem will never be ‚Äúfireproofed.‚Äù Some level of crown 
fire will likely occur in the future, particularly in untreated areas. Even within treated 
 
98

areas, passive crown fire may occur, especially during dry years. However, the overall 
management objective of reducing canopy fuels and crown fire hazard was achieved in 
treated areas. Maintenance of the surface fire regime will be vital to retaining open forest 
conditions and relatively low crown fire hazard into the future. The Mt. Trumbull area 
contains additional dense ponderosa pine forests. If these areas remain untreated, they 
will remain vulnerable to stand-replacing crown fires which could cause large patches 
with high tree mortality and could potentially limit conifer regeneration (Barclay et al. 
2004). Severe fires may even result in ecosystem conversion to shrubfields or grasslands 
(Savage and Mast 2005, Strom 2005). The Mt. Trumbull ponderosa pine ecosystem is not 
yet ‚Äúrestored‚Äù. However, restoration treatments have been successful at reducing crown 
fire hazard and creating more sustainable and dynamic forest conditions.  
 
Future Research 
 
The Mt. Trumbull Ponderosa Pine Restoration Project has provided myriad 
research opportunities to date and further opportunities will likely continue if adequate 
funding is maintained and if ecosystem restoration remains a priority. Because the 
remainder of the planned restoration treatments will presumably be implemented within 
the next few years, subsequent landscape-scale assessments of restoration implementation 
and effectiveness and potential fire behavior should include data from the entire plot grid 
and should occur approximately once per decade. Inventories of ponderosa pine seedlings 
should be conducted once every five years until verification of adequate regeneration of 
this species is documented. It is important that monitoring continues so the adaptive 
 
99

management process functions as designed. Finally, due to its scientific value, the control 
should remain untreated indefinitely. 
 
The BLM currently manages two wilderness areas at Mt. Trumbull. Research 
plots were installed in the Mt. Logan Wilderness (Waltz and Ful√© 1998) and the Mt. 
Trumbull Wilderness (Heinlein et al. 1999) in the late 1990‚Äôs to inventory contemporary 
forest conditions. Tree condition should be remeasured on these plots so presettlement 
tree mortality can be assessed. In addition, potential fire behavior should be assessed. The 
results from these proposed assessments and the results from the current study can be 
used in the environmental assessments of these two wilderness areas to evaluate the level 
of ecological degradation and demonstrate the potential benefits of restoration treatments. 
Additional studies should be initiated to develop and test a range of treatment alternatives 
for these ecologically important areas. 
Aerial photographs from 1940, 1992, 2003, and other years exist for the Mt. 
Trumbull area. A change-over-time study should be conducted using these remotely 
sensed data to supplement the on-the-ground data used in the current study. Landscape 
metrics such as mean patch size, area to edge ratio, and connectivity could be used to 
describe the Mt. Trumbull landscape in 1940, 1992 (pre-treatment), and 2003 (post-
treatment) and would be particularly beneficial to wildlife researchers. 
The efforts put forth by the BLM have resulted in the implementation of 
landscape-scale restoration treatments at Mt. Trumbull and have provided researchers 
with a ‚Äúliving laboratory‚Äù for ponderosa pine restoration research. Results from continued 
monitoring of existing studies and new research at Mt. Trumbull will provide managers 
and researchers opportunities to address future resource management challenges.
