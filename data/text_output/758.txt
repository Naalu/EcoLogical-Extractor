Abstract.
We evaluated canopy fuels and potential fire behaviour changes following landscape-scale restoration treat-
ments in a ponderosa pine forest at Mt Trumbull, Arizona, USA. The goal of the project was to restore historical forest
structure by thinning and burning, thereby reducing canopy fuels and minimising active crown fire potential. We mea-
sured 117 permanent plots before (1996–97) and after (2003) treatments. The plots were evenly distributed across the
landscape and represented an area of ∼1200 ha, about half of which was an untreated control. We compared canopy fuel
estimates using three different methods to assess whether fire behaviour modelling outputs were sensitive to the choice
of canopy fuel equation. Treatments decreased canopy fuel load by 43–50% from 0.77–1.83 kg m−2 to 0.44–0.91 kg m−2
(the range of values reflects the different canopy fuel equations) and decreased canopy bulk density by 42–61% from
0.038–0.172 kg m−3 to 0.022–0.067 kg m−3 in the treated area, while slight increases occurred in the control. We applied
two fire models to estimate potential fire behaviour: FlamMap and NEXUS. These models differ in several important fea-
tures but predicted outcomes were consistent: under extreme drought and wind conditions, the proportion of the landscape
susceptible to active crown fire decreased in the treated area while little change occurred in the control.

Introduction
The increase of stand-replacing crown fires in ecosystems that
historically supported frequent surface fire regimes is a major
ecological concern (Covington 2000;Allen et al. 2002). Numer-
ous projects have been implemented throughout the western
United States to restore historical ecosystem structure and func-
tion and to reduce the risk of stand-replacing crown fires (Scott
1998a; Lynch et al. 2000; Fulé et al. 2001a; Stratton 2004). Stud-
ies that examine treatment effects on fire behaviour or severity
can be classified into three categories: experimental, observa-
tional, and modelling. Experimental studies test fire behaviour
by purposely igniting fires and examining the effects during and
after the burn. Although researchers have deliberately ignited
crown fires to study their properties in certain isolated settings
(Alexander et al. 2004), most experimental studies are focussed
on effects of relatively low-intensity fires (Weaver 1957; Coving-
ton et al. 1997; Fulé et al. 2002a). Observational studies examine
the effects of wildfires after they occur. Pollet and Omi (2002),
Martinson and Omi (2003), Graham (2003), and Cram and Baker
(2003) showed that treated stands generally showed lower fire
severity, although treatments did not necessarily reduce severe
burning or prevent the passage of landscape-scale crown fires.
Following the 2002 Rodeo-Chediski fire in Arizona, Finney
et al. (2005) used satellite imagery and Strom and Fulé (2007)
used ground data to show that burning or cutting plus burn-
ing treatments substantially reduced fire severity. Observational
approaches are essential for measuring real-world effects of
treatments, but the scope of inference of the approach remains
limited by lack of pre-fire data, randomisation, and replica-
tion. The final technique, fire behaviour modelling, is the most
removed from actual fire behaviour but the easiest and most
flexible for testing alternative scenarios of stand development,
treatments, or weather conditions. Many studies have used mod-
els to evaluate potential fire behaviour after restoration or fuel
treatments at scales ranging from stands (Stephens 1998; Fulé
et al. 2001a, 2001b, 2002a; Faiella 2005) to landscapes (Fiedler
and Keegan 2003; Fulé et al. 2004; Stratton 2004).
Wildland fire is classified into ground (subsurface), surface,
or crown categories based on where in the fuel strata burning
occurs (Pyne et al. 1996). Crown fires are further subdivided into
three types: passive, active, and independent (VanWagner 1977).
Passive crown fire, or torching, occurs when fire transitions from
the surface and ignites the lower canopy.The windspeed at which
torching is initiated, the torching index, is largely a function of
canopy base height (CBH), the lowest height above the ground
at which there is a sufficient amount of canopy fuel to propagate
fire vertically into the canopy (Scott 1998b; Scott and Reinhardt
2001). Active crown fires burn the entire surface–canopy fuel
complex, depending primarily on the bulk density of foliage and
finetwigsinthecanopy.Independentcrownfires,oractivecrown
fires that do not rely on surface fire, are rare (Van Wagner 1993)
and not considered further here. As passive and active crown
fire behaviour are linked to different canopy fuel variables, it
is possible to encounter a situation where passive crown fire is
not predicted to occur, owing to a high CBH, but active crown
fire could occur, owing to high canopy bulk density (CBD, the

mass of available canopy fuel per unit canopy volume; Scott
and Reinhardt 2001). Scott and Reinhardt (2001) described this
hysteresis as a ‘conditional’ crown fire; active crown fire could
occur on the condition that canopy burning entered the stand
from outside; otherwise, surface fire would occur.
Canopy fuels are a crucial input for models that predict crown
fire (Scott and Reinhardt 2002) but they are rarely measured
directly. Brown (1978) provided allometric equations developed
in the northern Rocky Mountains for ponderosa pine that have
been used to estimate canopy fuel characteristics and have been
widely applied (Keane et al. 2000; Pollet and Omi 2002). In
Arizona, Fulé et al. (2001a, 2004) applied locally developed
allometric equations that predicted less canopy fuel, and hence
lower CBD, than would have been predicted by Brown’s (1978)
equations. Cruz et al. (2003) developed stand-scale equations to
predict canopy fuels based on tree density and basal area. The
selection of a canopy fuel modelling approach has been shown
to affect fire behaviour model results.
Deterministic semi-empirical fire behaviour models based on
Rothermel’s (1972) surface fire model, coupled with crown fire
initiation and spread models, are widely used in fire behaviour
analysis. FARSITE, a commonly used computer program, uses
spatially explicit terrain, fuels, and weather inputs to simulate the
growth, spread, and behaviour of wildland fires (Finney 1998).
The variant FlamMap, adapted for assessing fuel hazards, uses
the same inputs as FARSITE but predicts potential fire behaviour
simultaneously for each individual pixel on the raster land-
scape and does not have a temporal component (Stratton 2006).
NEXUS (v. 2.0., Systems for Environmental Management, Mis-
soula, MT), another hazard model, uses plot- or stand-scale
data to predict potential fire behaviour (Scott 1999; Scott and
Reinhardt 2001).
Initiated in 1995, the MtTrumbull Ponderosa Pine Ecosystem
Restoration Project aimed to restore forest structure and ecosys-
tem processes similar to conditions that occurred in the area
before 1870 (Moore et al. 1999), reduce fuel loads, disrupt fuel
continuity, and reduce the risk of stand-replacing crown fires by
implementing landscape-scale mechanical thinning followed by
prescribed surface fire (Moore et al. 2003). In the present study,
our overall intent was to evaluate the effect of the landscape-scale
restoration treatments on crown fire hazard. In order to do so,
however, we had to deal with the uncertainty and inconsistencies
that currently exist in modelling canopy fuels and canopy fire
behaviour. As there are multiple published models and no single
definitive analytical method, we chose to compare several alter-
natives.Where multiple models have converging results, the user
can feel greater confidence in the predictions; this approach is
commonlytakeninclimatechangeresearch(e.g.McKenzieetal.
2004). Our goals were to: (1) compare three common canopy
fuel estimation approaches using tree data collected in the cur-
rent study; (2) compare the output from FlamMap and NEXUS;
and (3) assess the effectiveness of landscape-scale restoration
treatments on reducing crown fire hazard.
Methods
Study area
Mt Trumbull is located in north-western Arizona, USA, in
the Uinkaret Mountains on the Arizona Strip in the Grand
Canyon–Parashant National Monument and managed by the
Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Vegetation in the study
area (elevation 2000 to 2250 m) comprises ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson var. scopulorum Engelm.)
and Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.), with Utah juniper
(Juniperus osteosperma [Torr.] Little), pinyon (Pinus edulis
Engelm.), New Mexico locust (Robinia neomexicana Gray) and
several shrubs occurring throughout the area. Soils are derived
from basaltic parent material. Relatively open forest structure
conditions were maintained by a frequent fire regime before
Euro-American settlement in 1870 (Waltz et al. 2003).
AnnualprecipitationatNixonFlats(elevation1981 m,∼3 km
NE of study site) averaged 47.2 cm with an average January
temperature of 1◦C and an average July temperature of 21◦C
between January 1992 and December 2003 (Western Regional
Climate Center 2005). Annual precipitation at Mt Logan (ele-
vation 2195 m, ∼2 km SW of study site) averaged 31.2 cm with
an average January temperature of −1◦C and an average July
temperature of 20◦C between January 1986 and December 2003
(Western Regional Climate Center 2005).
About 500 ha of the ∼1200-ha study landscape comprise a
contiguous, ‘untreated’, densely treed area (hereafter ‘control’).
The remaining 700 ha, hereafter ‘treated area’, are adjacent to
the control. Restoration treatments were carried out between
1996 and 2003 (Moore et al. 2003; Waltz et al. 2003). Some
untreated areas remain within the treated area boundary, such
as controls for other experiments, or operationally inaccessible
areas, in patches ranging from ∼10 to 40 ha. Additionally, some
areas within the treated area were thinned only or burned only.
Restoration treatment prescriptions
The thinning design was based on the presettlement (pre-1870)
pattern of tree species composition and spatial arrangement
(Covington et al. 1997; Waltz et al. 2003). All living ponderosa
pines older than 1870 or larger than 70-cm diameter at breast
height (DBH) were retained (Moore et al. 2003); presettlement
ponderosa pines of any size were identified in the field based
on yellow bark coloration and tree characteristics (White 1985).
In addition, wherever evidence of presettlement remnant pon-
derosa pine material was encountered (i.e. snags, logs, stumps,
stump holes), one and a half post-settlement ponderosa pine
replacement trees (if >40.6-cm DBH) or three ponderosa pine
replacement trees (if ≤40.6-cm DBH) were retained within an
∼18.2-m search radius. The net result was to retain the preset-
tlement ponderosa pines that were still alive, plus leave up to
300% more ponderosa pine trees than were present before 1870.
The surplus of retained trees was intended to account for the
smaller biomass contributed by smaller diameter replacement
trees, possible loss of presettlement evidence, and to allow a
margin for unintended mortality due to restoration treatments
(Covington et al. 1997). Because post-settlement replacement
trees were located near remnant evidence of presettlement struc-
tures, the spatial variability that existed before disturbance of the
historical fire regime was reflected in the post-treatment forest
structure. Therefore, rather than a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach,
areas that were relatively open in 1870 (i.e. few remnants found)
would be relatively open after treatment and areas that were rel-
atively dense in 1870 would be relatively dense after treatment.

Originally, Gambel oak trees were also thinned, but given high
oak mortality due to prescribed burning, these guidelines were
modified early in the project to terminate oak cutting. Trees of
otherspecieswerenotcutbecausetheyweresparseandrelatively
susceptible to prescribed fire. Unmarked trees were commer-
cially logged or non-commercially thinned in this leave-tree
thinning. Slash was lopped and scattered and was crushed by
a bulldozer in some areas (Jerman et al. 2004). Prescribed burn
preparation included raking accumulated forest floor material
away from living presettlement trees to prevent cambial girdling
(Sackettetal.1996)andfromlargesnagstolimitignition(Moore
et al. 2003). Prescribed fires were often ignited at night when
humidity was relatively high. It is important to note that although
most of the treatments were completed by the time of our mea-
surement in 2003, there were portions that were thinned only or
burned only.
Field methods
Prior to treatment in 1996 and 1997, we installed 117 perma-
nent plots on a 300-m grid (Fig. 1) throughout the Mt Trumbull
landscape in a before-after-control-impact (BACI) study design
(Stewart-Oaten and Bence 2001); all plots (55 control, 61 treated,
and 1 partially treated that was excluded from analysis) were
remeasured in 2003. The plots (0.1 ha (20 × 50 m) in size) were
adapted from the National Park Service’s (NPS) Fire Monitoring
protocols (Reeberg 1995; NPS 2003), with modifications to col-
lect dendroecological data for reconstruction of historical forest
structure.
Overstorey trees, those larger than 15-cm DBH were mea-
sured on the entire plot (1000 m2) and trees between 2.5 and 15-
cm DBH (pole-sized trees) were measured on one-quarter-plot
(250 m2); all measured trees were tagged and species and DBH
wererecorded.Totalheightwasmeasuredforpole-sizedtreesbut
not for overstorey trees during the pretreatment measurement,
because the older NPS protocol did not include height; later,
recognising the value of height data for estimating biomass and
canopy fire behaviour, we measured total height and crown base
height for all trees in 2003. All overstorey and pole-sized trees
were also mapped within the 1000-m2 plot. Ponderosa pine trees
wereconsideredpotentiallypresettlement(i.e.establishedbefore
1870) if DBH ≥37.5 cm or if bark was yellowed (White 1985).
Trees of all other species were considered potentially preset-
tlement if DBH ≥17 cm (Barger and Ffolliott 1972). Tree cores
were collected at 40 cm above ground level for all potentially pre-
settlement trees and for a random 10% subsample of all other live
trees ≥2.5 cm DBH to determine past DBH, as described below.
Canopy cover measured by vertical projection (Ganey and Block
1994) was recorded at 3-m intervals along the two 50-m side-
lines of each plot for a total of 32 points per plot. Post-treatment
measurements on plots coincided as closely as possible to the
original day and month of the original measurement.
Reconstruction methods
Tree increment cores were surfaced and crossdated (Stokes and
Smiley 1968) using locally developed tree-ring chronologies.
Rings were counted on cores that could not be crossdated, espe-
cially young trees and junipers. Additional years to the centre
were estimated using a pith locator (concentric circles matched
to the curvature and density of the inner rings) for cores without
a pith (Applequist 1958).
We reconstructed forest structure using dendroecological
methods described in detail by Fulé et al. (1997) and Mast et al.
(1999). Diameters for all living trees were reconstructed by sub-
tracting the radial growth since 1870 measured on increment
cores and estimating death date of dead trees based on tree
condition class using diameter-dependent snag decomposition
rates (Thomas et al. 1979; Rogers et al. 1984). We performed a
sensitivity analysis by using the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile
decomposition rates to examine the effect of slower or faster
decomposition on estimates of death date and 1870 structure.
Less than ±1% change in reconstructed forest structure occurred
during this analysis, so the 50th percentile reconstruction was
used in the present study.
Forest structure reconstruction methods were based on the
assumption that evidence of all trees (i.e. snags, logs, stumps,
stump holes) present in 1870 was intact, located, and correctly
identified during the pretreatment inventory. The probability
that this occurred was relatively high given the absence of fire
since 1870 combined with the semiarid environment limiting
the decomposition of conifer wood (Fulé et al. 1997; Mast et al.
1999; Waltz et al. 2003), and because field crews were trained
to identify the presence and species of presettlement structures.
Moore et al. (2004) found that reconstruction field techniques in
a similar environment and forest type were reliable within ±10%
of tree density over ∼90 years.
Fire behaviour model inputs
We used the following inputs for fire behaviour modelling with
both FlamMap (Stratton 2006) and the NEXUS Fire Behaviour
and HazardAssessment System (Scott 1999; Scott and Reinhardt
2001, 2004). Surface fire behaviour fuel model 9 (Anderson
1982), the most common model in the area, was used as a stan-
dard for all simulations. Fire weather extremes representing the
97th percentile of low fuel moisture for June from 34 years of
data on the Kaibab National Forest (Tusayan weather station)
were used in all simulations as described in Fulé et al. (2002a):
1-h fuel moisture 1.7%, 10-h 3.0%, 100-h 4.5%, temperature
32.2◦C. These are very dry and windy conditions, representing
the type of severe weather under which uncontrollable crown
fires spread.
Crown fuel load (CFL, kg m−2) and CBD (kg m−3) were
estimated using three methods. The first method estimated CFL
using locally developed allometric equations for foliage and fine
twigs of ponderosa pine (Fulé et al. 2001a), Gambel oak (Clary
andTeidemann 1986), and pinyon and juniper (Grier et al. 1992);
oak equations were also used for locust.The second method used
equations from Brown (1978) to calculate foliage and fine twigs
for ponderosa pine, plus the non-pine species equations used in
the first method. In both of the first two methods, canopy depth
(CD) was estimated using averages of maximum tree height (top
of canopy) and crown base height (bottom of canopy). CBD was
calculated as CFL divided by CD for both methods. CBH and
CD in 1870 were estimated using regression equations devel-
oped with data from Rainbow Plateau, Grand Canyon, Arizona,
a nearby never-harvested reference site (Fulé et al. 2002b). The
third method used equations developed by Cruz et al. (2003)

An interpolation of potential fire behaviour across the study area using FlamMap shows that under
extreme conditions (80% foliar moisture content and 70-km h−1 winds), active crown fire would occur on 0%
of the 1870 landscape compared with 44% before treatment (1996–97) and 21% after treatment (2003). The
control is in the lower half of the landscape. Model inputs used were low quintile canopy base height (CBH),
canopy bulk density (CBD) using equations from Cruz et al. (2003), and 80% foliar moisture content (FMC).
from Brown’s (1978) ponderosa pine allometric predictors and
mean length of the canopy fuel stratum to estimate CFL and
CBD directly from tree density and basal area. We used the low-
est quintile values (lowest 20%) of CBH on each plot as a model
input to better represent actual conditions (Fulé et al. 2001a,
2002a). Live foliar moisture content (FMC) was 80% unless
noted otherwise.
FlamMap requires several spatial geographic information
system inputs, including elevation, slope, aspect, and canopy
cover. The three topographic layers were derived from a stan-
dard digital elevational model from the US Geological Survey.
Canopy cover was calculated from plot data for 1996–97 and
2003 and was estimated using Rainbow Plateau regressions for
1870. Landscape patterns for each input layer were estimated

using inverse distance weighted interpolation between plots with
10-m resolution. As is the case with interpolated maps in gen-
eral, data are highly accurate at the plot point locations and of
unknown accuracy elsewhere. The plot points were only 300 m
apart and there were >50 points per treatment, so the map
provided a reasonable representation of the landscape.
We used windspeeds of 10 through 70 km h−1, in 10-km h−1
increments. Wind azimuth was held constant at 225◦to match
the prevailing south-west wind direction at Mt Trumbull during
fire season. Each FlamMap run was saved as an ASCII file and
then converted to raster files. The Patch Analyst (Version 3.0)
extension for ArcView 3.3 (ESRI, Redlands, CA) was used to
calculate percentage of the landscape and mean patch size based
on the number of pixels in each fire type (i.e. surface, passive, or
active). For NEXUS, individual plot data were entered, including
slope (average 13%) and wind reduction factor (0.3). Wind was
allowed to run upslope in NEXUS, which may have had the
effect of increasing potential fire behaviour on plots with a north-
east aspect. NEXUS outputs were interpolated across the plot
grid inArcView to create maps.Although the topographical data
inputs for NEXUS were spatially limited, one of our goals was
to compare the NEXUS output with the more spatially explicit
model FlamMap. Percentage of the landscape for NEXUS was
calculated based on the percentage of plots in each fire type.
Results
Canopy fuels
For all of the time–treatment combinations in the present study,
Brown’s (1978) equations always produced the highest value for
average CFL, the Fulé et al. (2001a) estimate was always lowest,
and the equation of Cruz et al. (2003) always produced values
between Fulé’s and Brown’s CFL estimates (Table 1). Cruz’s CFL
estimates were similar to Fulé’s and exceeded them by only 0.1–
12%, whereas Brown’s estimates exceeded Fulé’s estimates by
79–163%. For CBD, Fulé’s equation again produced the lowest
estimate, but Cruz’s estimate was highest and Brown’s estimate
was intermediate in all but one instance (1870, Treated). None

of the CBD estimates were similar; Brown’s estimates exceeded
Fulé’s estimates by 184–268% and Cruz’s estimates exceeded
Fulé’s estimates by 153–491%.
CFL and CBD values were relatively low over the entire study
area in 1870, compared with those measured in later years.
Depending on which equations were used, CFL increased by
220–343% and CBD increased by 279–648% between 1870 and
1996–97 across the entire landscape. By 2003, treatment lowered
CFL by 42% (Fulé et al. 2001a), 48% (Brown 1978), and 61%
(Cruz et al. 2003) and CBD by 43% (Fulé), 50% (Brown) and

in the control (Table 1).
CBH was not measured before treatment, but after treatment,
CBH averaged 0.4 m higher in the treated area than the control
and 1.1 m higher when unburned plots within the treated area
were excluded from analysis (Table 2). Ponderosa pine CBH
was higher in the treated area (4.8 m) than the control (3.7 m).
Low quintile CBH was lowest in the control, higher in the overall
treated area, and highest on thinned and burned plots (Table 2).
Potential ﬁre behaviour
FlamMap and NEXUS modelling results for the three CBD
levels showed that crown fire activity was correlated with

298

CBD when modelled with constant windspeeds and FMC. The
FlamMap simulations were sensitive to CBD, showing no active
crown fire when the lowest values (equations from Fulé et al.
2001a) were used and minimal active crown fire when interme-
diate values (equations from Brown 1978) were used.Therefore,
we restricted our analysis to results from the two fire behaviour
models using the highest CBD values, calculated using equations
from Cruz et al. (2003).
FlamMap predicted that active crown fire would not occur
within the study area in 1870 even with 70-km h−1 windspeeds
(Fig. 1).Although only 5% of the 1870 landscape would support
passive crown fire with 10-km h−1 winds, 64% of the landscape
would support passive crown fire when windspeed was increased
to 70 km h−1 (Fig. 1). Mean patch size of areas that could support
passive crown fire in 1870 increased from 2.1 ha with 10-km h−1
windspeeds to 52.9 ha with 70-km h−1 windspeeds.
In contrast to the 1870 condition, by 1996–97, FlamMap pre-
dicted that 18% of the pretreatment (1996–97) landscape would
support passive crown fire even with 10-km h−1 windspeeds.
When windspeeds were increased to 70 km h−1, nearly 90% of
the landscape was classified as either passive or active (Fig. 2).
In this scenario, FlamMap predicted that 13% of the landscape
would burn with surface fire. However, because these areas had
high CBH, they could have been classified as conditional crown
fire if FlamMap had had this capability. Mean patch size of areas
that could support passive crown fires increased from 3.0 ha with
10-km h−1 windspeeds to 4.6 ha with 70-km h−1 windspeeds in
the pretreatment landscape. Mean patch size of areas that could
initiate active crown fires increased from 0.1 ha with 10-km h−1
windspeeds to 15.1 ha with 70-km h−1 windspeeds in 1996–97.
The 2003 treated landscape diverged in predicted fire
behaviour compared with the control. The FlamMap output
(70-km h−1 windspeeds) indicated that the percentage of the
landscape in the treated area susceptible to active crown fire
was reduced from 46% to less than 5%; however, the model
predicted that 69% of the treated area would still be able to sup-
port passive crown fire (Fig. 2). Mean patch size of areas that
could initiate active crown fires decreased from 14.9 to 2.7 ha in
the treated area when modelled with 70-km h−1 windspeeds. In
the control, the percentage of the landscape susceptible to active
crown fire increased from 43 to 44% between 1996–97 and 2003
and mean patch size of areas that could initiate active crown
fires increased to 29.5 ha when modelled using 70-km h−1 wind-
speeds. FlamMap predicted that 26% of the control would not
supportpassivecrownfireorinitiateactivecrownfirewhenmod-
elled using 70-km h−1 windspeeds; however, these areas could
have been classified as conditional crown fire if FlamMap could
predict this situation (Figs 1 and 2).
Using NEXUS to model potential fire behaviour, we pre-
dicted that some active crown fire would occur within the study
area in 1870 with windspeeds greater than 50 km h−1, with up
to 17% of the landscape supporting active crown fire when
modelled with 70-km h−1 windspeeds (Fig. 3). Like FlamMap,
NEXUS predicted that 68% of the 1870 landscape would support
passive crown fire with 70-km h−1 winds. NEXUS predicted that
44% of the pretreatment landscape would support passive crown
fire and 5% would support active crown fire with 10-km h−1
windspeeds. When windspeeds were increased to 70 km h−1,
81% of the pretreatment landscape would support active crown
fire. The 2003 NEXUS output (70-km h−1 windspeeds) indi-
cated that the percentage of the landscape that could initiate or
sustain active crown fire (i.e. conditional crown fire) was reduced
from 82 to 48% in the treated area; however, the model predicted
that less than 4% of the treated area would support surface fire
(Fig. 2). In the 2003 landscape, torching index (the windspeed
necessary to initiate passive crown fire) and crowning index (the
windspeed necessary to sustain active crown fire) were both
greater in the treated area compared with the control (Table 3).
Average torching index was also three times greater and aver-
age crowning index was more than double pretreatment levels in
the treated area. Crown percentage burned, rate of spread, heat
per unit area, and average flame lengths were all reduced in the
treated area when modelled using 2003 conditions (Table 3).
Discussion
Canopy fuels
Canopy fuel values are essential model inputs for both FlamMap
and NEXUS. It is important that canopy characteristics are esti-
mated as accurately as possible (Scott and Reinhardt 2001)
but values for CFL and CBD were highly variable depending
on which equations were used (Table 1). Direct measurement
of canopy fuels has recently been completed on a dense pon-
derosa pine plot (10-m radius) near Flagstaff,Arizona, ∼160 km
south-east of our study area (Scott and Reinhardt 2005). Prior
to treatment, the plot’s CFL was 0.93 kg m−2 and CBD was
0.17 kg m−3; removal of 75% of the original basal area by
thinning from below reduced these values to 0.27 kg m−2 and
0.057 kg m−3 (Scott and Reinhardt 2005). These values for CFL
are similar to those generated by the Fulé and the Cruz equa-
tions in the untreated 1996–97 landscape (0.77 to 0.98 kg m−2,
respectively; values with the Brown equations were much higher:
0.18 to 2.31 kg m−2 (Table 1)). However, Scott and Reinhardt’s
(2005) CBD measurements were most similar to CBD estimates
using Cruz’s equation (0.172–0.226 kg m−3). Because the allo-
metric equations presented by Fulé et al. (2001a) were locally
developed, have high goodness-of-fit (Fulé et al. 2001a), and had
estimates consistent with the only actual field measurement of
canopy fuels in northernArizona (Scott and Reinhardt 2005), we
suggest that they provide the most reliable estimates of the avail-
able canopy fuel biomass. However, the approach used by Fulé
et al. (2001a) to calculate CFL by CD assumes that canopy fuels
are evenly distributed throughout the canopy depth. Scott and
Reinhardt (2005) illustrate that CBD varies through the canopy
and they report the peak values, arguing that maximum CBD
is the most important factor in assessing crown fire spread. As
canopy fuel measurement grows more sophisticated, estimates
will become increasingly accurate. For now, however, it may be
advisable for analysts to use several approaches, as we did in the
present study, in order to understand the sensitivity of outputs to
changes in inputs.
Potential ﬁre behaviour
Fire behaviour model outputs should be interpreted with caution.
The purpose of modelling fire behaviour was not to accurately
estimate the behaviour of an actual fire, but rather to use the out-
put as a means of comparing potential fire behaviour between
the three time periods as well as between the control and treated

An interpolation of potential fire behaviour across the study area using NEXUS shows that under extreme conditions
(80% foliar moisture content and 70-km h−1 winds), only 17% of the 1870 landscape would support active crown fire compared
with 81% before treatment (1996–97) and 63% after treatment (2003). The control is in the lower half of the landscape. Model

areas in 2003 over a range of windspeeds. There are two major
differences between the two models. First, in FlamMap, the
model inputs are interpolated or calculated across the plot grid
and results are calculated for each 10 × 10-m cell, whereas in
NEXUS, inputs are calculated for each plot and outputs are inter-
polated across the landscape. Thus even though the underlying
fire behaviour predictions are nearly the same in the two models,
thedifferentapproachestomodellingfireoverthelandscapelead
to some differences in the results. Second, NEXUS accounts for
the situation known as the conditional crown fire (Scott and
Reinhardt 2001); FlamMap does not.
Despite differences in approach, FlamMap and NEXUS pro-
duced highly consistent results: relatively low crown fire hazard
in 1870, a marked increase in crown fire hazard by 1996–97,
and decreasing crown fire hazard in the treated area by 2003
with little change in the control (Figs 1 and 3). With FlamMap,

increases in windspeed produced gradual increases in active
crown fire, whereas with NEXUS, active crown fire increased
more dramatically at a threshold windspeed of ∼30–40 km h−1
(Fig. 2). Overall, NEXUS always predicted more passive and
active crown fire compared with FlamMap when modelled under
the same conditions. For example, comparing the 1870 output for
the two models, with 30-km h−1 windspeeds, NEXUS predicted
that the percentage of the landscape classified as passive crown
fire was more than two times greater than FlamMap’s prediction;
similarly, with 70-km h−1 windspeeds, FlamMap did not predict
any active crown fire whereas NEXUS predicted ∼20%.
The most significant difference between the two models
is that NEXUS accounts for conditional crown fire, whereas
FlamMap does not. In FlamMap, a pixel cannot be classified as
active crown fire unless it is first classified as passive crown fire;
thus, the maps produced by FlamMap only show areas that can
initiate active crown fire. Therefore, if torching index exceeded
the crowning index for a given cell and could sustain active
crownfire,FlamMapwouldconsideritsurfacefireeventhoughit
should be considered conditional crown fire. FlamMap’s inabil-
ity to predict conditional crown fire was demonstrated by the
large area in the 2003 control classified as surface fire even
when modelled with extreme weather conditions (Fig. 1). Based
on plot data and photos, it was evident that this area had abundant
canopy fuels that could sustain an already burning active crown
fire, but because of insufficient ladder fuels (i.e. high CBH),
the stands would be unable to initiate active burning even with
extreme weather conditions. We suspected that this area would
have been classified as conditional crown fire if FlamMap had
the ability to do so. The NEXUS output revealed that torching
index exceeded the crowning index for the plots in this area; thus,
NEXUS classified this area as active (i.e. conditional crown fire)
when modelled with 70-km h−1 windspeeds (Fig. 3).
The overall objective in the current study was to evaluate
the effectiveness of restoration treatments on crown fire hazard.
Both the FlamMap and NEXUS models predicted a range of
variability in fire behaviour throughout the landscape, but both
consistently predicted reduced crown fire hazard in the treated
area compared with pretreatment levels and compared with the
control (Figs 1 and 3). Although both models predicted large
areas of passive crown fire in the 2003 treated area under high
windspeeds, areas classified as active crown fire were limited to
two small patches. Furthermore, the patterns observed in the
2003 treated area resembled the fire behaviour predicted for
the 1870 landscape for both models. Increased torching and
crowning indices due to treatment (Table 3) were consistent
with results from previous research on similar restoration treat-
ments in northern Arizona (Fulé et al. 2001a, 2001b, 2002a;
Faiella 2005). The model results were also consistent with on-
the-ground fire behaviour observations. In April 2000, the ‘EB3
Escape Fire’ burned as active crown fire in an untreated con-
trol unit (Waltz et al. 2003) directly adjacent to our study site.
Despite the differing approaches for calculating fuels and the
different modelling approaches, the results converged, show-
ing that canopy fuels were reduced and the potential for crown
fire behaviour was diminished by the treatments. The present
study cannot provide a definitive answer about which model is
‘correct’. Such an answer would come from extended canopy
fuel sampling (for instance, broadening the work of Scott and
Reinhardt 2005) and testing the results with experimental or
unintentional crown fires.These are beyond the scope of the cur-
rent study. But our comparative approach to modelling showed
that any of multiple modelling approaches based on published
techniques lead to similar conclusions.
Management implications
Currently available models for estimating canopy fuels and sim-
ulating crown fire behaviour were useful in assessing the results
of restoration treatments. The data from field plots based on the
NPS Fire Monitoring protocol were sufficient to initialise the
simulation models and the outputs were consistent with those
from other published studies and from wildfire observations.
Both FlamMap and NEXUS produced similar predictions of fire
behaviour. However, the precise quantification of many canopy
fuel variables remains poorly understood, as evidenced by the
wide discrepancy in the values reported in Table 1, and differ-
ences in canopy fuel estimation models can lead to differing fire
behaviour projections. Analysts may not have time to carry out
an exhaustive comparison of modelling alternatives, as we did
here, but they should be aware of the possibility of differing
numerical values for important variables such as CBD. Recog-
nising that fire behaviour prediction models are more useful for
comparisons than for absolute numbers, managers should seek

methods in all analyses.
Mt Trumbull and similar ponderosa pine ecosystems will
never be ‘fireproofed’. Some level of crown fire will likely
occur in the future, particularly in untreated areas. Even within
treated areas, passive crown fire may occur, especially during
dry years. However, the overall management objective of reduc-
ing canopy fuels and crown fire hazard was achieved in treated
areas. Maintenance of the surface fire regime will be vital to
retaining open forest conditions and relatively low crown fire
hazard into the future.The MtTrumbull area contains additional
dense ponderosa pine forests. If these areas remain untreated,
stand-replacing crown fires could cause large patches with high
tree mortality, which could potentially limit conifer regeneration
(Barclay et al. 2004). Severe fires may even result in ecosystem
conversion to shrubfields or grasslands (Savage and Mast 2005;
Strom and Fulé 2007).The MtTrumbull ponderosa pine ecosys-
tem is not yet ‘restored’. However, restoration treatments have
been successful at substantially reducing crown fire hazard and
creating more sustainable forest conditions. Managers should
continue to model crown fire hazard and monitor on-the-ground
fire behaviour as additional areas within the project are treated.
