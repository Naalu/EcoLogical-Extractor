Abstract
Dam decommissioning projects, although
numerous, rarely include complete sets of data before
and after restoration for evaluating the ecological
consequences of such projects. In this study, we used
a before-after control-impact (BACI) design to assess
changes in leaf litter decomposition and associated
macroinvertebrate and fungal decomposers following
dam decommissioning in Fossil Creek, Arizona,
USA. Leaf litterbags were deployed in a relatively
pristine site above the dam and a highly disturbed site
below the dam where over 95% of the ﬂow was
previously diverted for hydropower generation. Leaf
litter decomposition was signiﬁcantly slower below
the dam both measurement years (pre- and post-
restoration) with no site-year interaction, indicating
that decomposition in this stream section was not
affected by increased ﬂow. In contrast, both macro-
invertebrates and fungi differed signiﬁcantly above
and below the dam prior to restoration but were
similar post-restoration, supporting the concept that
decomposer communities can quickly rebound fol-
lowing reintroduction of full ﬂow. Our results
indicate that some aquatic ecosystem variables can
return to a more natural state following ecological
restoration activities such as water ﬂow restoration.

Introduction
Dam decommissioning, that is, the termination of
some function of a dam, either by altering operation
or by dam removal, has become popular in attempting
to reverse ecosystem degradation caused by dams

2007; Doyle et al., 2008). Many dam effects, such as
sediment retention, water ﬂow reduction, and alter-
ations in habitat structure are thought to detrimentally
affect ecosystems by altering biotic communities,
ecosystem services, and ecological processes (e.g.,
Ward & Stanford, 1983; Bednarek, 2001). Dam
decommissionings offer the potential to reverse some
of these disturbances and return streams to more
natural states. However, the majority of dam decom-
missionings, like most stream restoration projects,
lack pre-restoration data and clearly deﬁned goals,
making quantitative comparisons before and after
restoration difﬁcult (Hart et al., 2002; Doyle et al.,
2003a; Palmer et al., 2005; Bernhardt et al., 2005).
Biotic recovery in response to stream restoration
can be rapid, especially when the physical and
chemical condition of the stream has not been
severely disturbed (Niemi et al., 1990; Gore et al.,
1990). Positive impacts of dam decommissionings
have been observed or are predicted by alleviating the
disturbance effects caused by damming. Restoration
goals of dam removals often focus on removing the
impoundment and re-creating lotic conditions above
the dam but may also emphasize restoring down-
stream habitat and reconnecting habitats above and
below the dam (Hart et al., 2002 and references
therein; Stanley et al., 2002; Marks, 2007). Other
positive, long-term geomorphic responses are possi-
ble based on models, although signiﬁcant uncertainty
remains (Doyle et al., 2002; Doyle et al., 2003b).
Problematic side effects of dam decommissionings
and removals include the downstream release of
contaminated or nutrient-laden sediment, channeli-
zation and channel scour, and extirpation of lentic-
adapted organisms upstream in the impounded reser-
voir (Bednarek, 2001; Stanley & Doyle, 2003; Sethi
et al., 2004). Although dams often alter both
upstream and downstream food webs, particularly
with respect to the macroinvertebrate community
(Power et al., 1996; Al-Lami et al., 1998; Cortes
et al., 1998; Stanley et al., 2002), one study found that
litter decomposition, macroinvertebrate biomass, bio-
logical oxygen demand, and nutrient concentrations
were not different in sites above and below a dam,
indicating that negative effects of dams may not be
universal (Casas et al., 2000). Consequently, com-
parisons before and after restoration are important in
establishing whether restoration projects such as dam
decommissionings are successful in improving the
overall condition of an ecosystem (Yount & Niemi,
1990).
Variability in dams and ecosystems also limits
comparative
ability
among
restoration
efforts.
Despite a large body of research related to aquatic
discontinuity effects (e.g., Ward & Stanford, 1983),
dam effects vary widely depending on the size and
functional characteristics of the dam, such as water
retention and hydraulic head (Poff & Hart, 2002).
The majority of available decommissioning litera-
ture has also come from small dam removal studies
in the US Midwest (e.g., Stanley et al., 2002; Doyle
et al., 2005; Cheng & Granata, 2007), which differ
in climate, species composition, and likely recovery
time in comparison to other ecoregions, such as the
arid ecosystems of the US Southwest (Hughes et al.,
1990). Additionally, studies concerned with the
downstream effects of restoration rather than focus-
ing on upstream changes in the former reservoir tend
to have emphasized sediment ﬁning (Cheng &
Granata, 2007) and varying degrees and timescales
of nutrient increases (Bushaw-Newton et al., 2002;
Ahearn & Dahlgren, 2005; Riggsbee et al. 2007),
but these changes are unlikely to occur in dam
decommissionings
where
the
dam
stays
intact.
Although these studies provide valuable information
on the effects of dam removals (removal of struc-
ture, reconnection of upstream and downstream
sites, release of sediments, nutrient pulses, and
more), it remains difﬁcult to evaluate the restoration
potential of site-speciﬁc attributes of a dam decom-
missioning,
particularly
when
the
dam
is
not
removed.
The dam decommissioning in Fossil Creek, Ari-
zona, USA, presented a unique opportunity to study
ﬂow restoration decoupled from other restoration
effects, particularly sediment release, because the
decommissioning is being conducted in stages over a
four-year period rather than initiating dam removal
and ﬂow restoration simultaneously. In 2005, water
ﬂow that was previously diverted from the stream via
a ﬂume at the dam was restored when the hydropower
facility was decommissioned, but the dam itself will
not be removed until 2009. Flow was restored by
keeping the water diversion in place at the dam but
removing the ﬂume structure just below it, allowing
water to be diverted around the dam and be reintro-
duced just below the dam at full ﬂow (Fig. 1, Online
Supplementary Figure).

In this work, we quantify some of the short-term
effects of returning full ﬂow below Fossil Creek
Dam. Leaf litter decomposition, macroinvertebrate
community attributes, fungal biomass, and water
quality and chemistry were compared before and
after restoration above and below the dam to test the
following hypotheses regarding short-term ecological
responses: (1) The water diversion would have
reduced leaf litter decomposition immediately below
the dam and restoration of ﬂow would reverse this
pattern, resulting in similar decomposition rates at
both sites. (2) Decomposition of different leaf species
would vary between sites prior to decommissioning
and would not respond uniformly to restoration. This
hypothesis was based in part on another study in the
area that found signiﬁcant differences in leaf decom-
position
rates
between
local
species
depending
primarily on litter quality (LeRoy & Marks, 2006)
and our assumption that the strength of species-
speciﬁc changes in leaf decomposition due to differ-
ences or alterations in water ﬂow would be inﬂuenced
in part by the quality of the litter. (3) Fungal biomass
and
macroinvertebrate
abundance
and
diversity
would be depressed below the dam but would recover
following restoration. (4) Macroinvertebrate commu-
nity
structure
would
differ
between
sites
pre-
restoration, but would be similar after restoration.
We expected to observe these changes or the initial
trajectories of such changes within six months after
restoration.
Materials and methods
Site descriptions
Fossil Creek is a spring-fed stream that begins
2,212 m above sea level and ends at the Verde River
777 m above sea level approximately 23 km down-
stream. The ﬁve primary geothermal springs at its
origin empty at a rate of 1,218 l/s at 21C. Less than
1 km below the springs a 10-m hydropower dam
diverted water to two hydropower plants for nearly
one hundred years, reducing base ﬂow directly below
the dam by more than 95%, to 5.6 l/s (Malusa et al.,
2003). Large vegetation consists of typical regional
riparian ﬂora, including Fremont cottonwood (Popu-
lus fremontii S. Wats.) and Arizona alder (Alnus
oblongifolia Torr.), which were used in this research.
The two study sites used for this project were
approximately 400 m above and 100 m below the
Fossil Creek Dam. Both sites were located in stream
sections characterized as small pools with cobble
substrate, approximately 1.0 m in depth, 15–20 m in
width, and 50 m in length post-restoration. Before
ﬂow restoration, the below-dam site was shallower
and narrower, approximately 0.5 m in depth and
10 m in width, whereas the dimensions of the above-
dam site were similar pre- and post-restoration. Sites
were chosen to be close to the dam while remaining
outside the small, artiﬁcial reservoir above the dam
and the deep pool below the dam (Monroe, 2002;
Fig. 1). The above-dam site represented a relatively
intact ‘‘control’’ site, while the below-dam site was
representative of much of the disturbed stream reach.
Study sites were sampled during the winters of 2003
(18 months before ﬂow restoration) and 2005 (six
months after restoration). The 2003 study was
initially carried out with the intent of being six to
twelve months prior to restoration, but delays in dam
decommissioning increased the temporal separation
between this study and the actual ﬂow restoration
date. Because this study was intended to observe
short-term changes following ﬂow restoration, the
2005 study was conducted six, rather than eighteen,
months after restoration.

Water quality and chemistry
Temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), DO percent
saturation, pH, salinity, total dissolved solids (TdS),
and speciﬁc conductivity (SpC) were measured using
a minisonde probe (Hydrolab-Hach Corporation,
Loveland, Colorado, USA) at both sites during the
ﬁrst litterbag removal (day 10) both years. Several
measurements were taken at random points across the
channel width, and these were averaged together for
each site. Three replicate 250-ml water samples were
also taken from random points across the channel
width at both sites using acid-washed, HDPE bottles
and were kept on ice during transport then frozen
until nutrient analysis. These samples were analyzed
for PO4
3-, NO3
-, and NH4
? concentrations using a
QuikChem FIA? 8000 automated spectrophotometer
system (Lachat-Hach Corporation, Loveland, Colo-
rado, USA). A sample from each replicate was
analyzed to ensure that any outlier samples contain-
ing possible contamination of a single bottle or
artiﬁcially high concentrations of nutrients from any
microsites would not be used for further analysis.
Leaf litter decomposition
Populus fremontii and Alnus oblongifolia leaves were
collected from nearby Beaver Creek by hanging tarps
under trees to catch leaves during natural abscission
in fall 2002 and stored indoors in sealed boxes at
room temperature until used in 2003 or 2005. The
litter quality of these species was similar in terms of
percent phosphorous and condensed tannins, but A.
oblongifolia had signiﬁcantly higher percent nitrogen
concentration based on a previous study using leaves
from the same source (LeRoy & Marks, 2006).
Leaves were separated by species and laid ﬂat in
6.4 mm mesh litterbags in 4.0 g quantities. Four
litterbag treatments were used per measurement year:
P. fremontii above and below the dam and A.
oblongifolia above and below the dam. Litterbags
were randomly anchored in the stream over a spatial
extent of approximately 20 m of stream length and
the middle 10 m of stream width at the above- or
below-dam sites in replicates of eight for 10 or
75 days. To avoid temporal bias in decomposition
rates between sites all litterbags (above and below
dam) were submerged in the stream on the same day
and were therefore removed from both sites on the
same days (e.g., the day 10 removal represented the
same calendar date for both sites). Handling losses
were estimated from mass loss in control litterbags
that were carried to and from Fossil Creek with the
other litterbags but never submerged in the stream.
On removal dates the leaf litter remaining in
litterbags was washed and ﬁltered through 250-lm
nets to remove sediment. The retained macroinver-
tebrates were preserved in 70% ethanol for further
processing. Two sets of ﬁve 11-mm leaf punches
were taken per litterbag from a stack of ﬁve leaves for
fungal biomass determination. The remaining litter
was dried at 70C for 72 h then ground using a Wiley
mill (Thomas Scientiﬁc, Swedesboro, New Jersey,
USA) and combusted at 500C in a mufﬂe furnace
(Barnstead International, Dubuque, Iowa, USA) for
1 h to determine ash-free dry mass (AFDM) values.
Natural log equations were created for AFDM values
to determine experimental leaf decomposition rates
(k) from 10 to 75 days in-stream. These rates were
compared using an equality of slopes test in SAS
(Version 8.01, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North
Carolina, USA, 2000), which allowed decomposition
rates between species and sites to be compared within
and between measurement years (Jenny et al., 1949;
Olson, 1963; Petersen & Cummins, 1974; Webster &
Benﬁeld, 1986).
Fungal biomass
Fungal biomass analysis was done using only leaf
punch sets taken from litterbags removed at day 10
because leaves from the day 75 removal were too
advanced in decomposition to allow taking adequate
leaf punches. From the two sets of leaf punches taken
during processing of the day 10 litterbags, one set of
punches was preserved in methanol (99.99% HPLC-
grade) and the other set was dried, ground, and
combusted in the same manner as the rest of the leaf
litter. Ergosterol concentrations were determined
from the sets of leaf punches preserved in methanol.
Because this sterol is largely unique to fungus, its
concentration in aquatic systems is directly related to
the abundance of hyphomycetes (Newell, 1992), and
multiplying by a constant then provides a quantitative
measure of fungal biomass (Gessner & Chauvet,
1993). The assay for ergosterol, high-performance
liquid
chromatography
(HPLC)
parameters,
and
mathematical conversion to mg fungus was done
38
Hydrobiologia (2009) 618:35–45
123

according to the methods of Suberkropp (2001), with
the exception that the residue dissolved in 1 ml of
methanol was ﬁltered using 13-mm Acrodisc ﬁlters
with a 0.2-lm PTFE membrane. Five standards of
known ergosterol concentration (1, 2.5, 5, 10, and
25 lg ml-1) were run every time the machine was
started, and a randomly chosen standard was run after
every 10–12 samples to verify consistent HPLC
performance. Obtained fungal values were divided by
AFDM values from the other set of leaf punches to
determine mg fungal biomass per g AFDM. Because
site and year were the major factors of interest, leaf
species was not used as a factor in the fungal biomass
analysis.
Aquatic macroinvertebrates
Macroinvertebrates associated with the leaf litter
were collected during day 10 removal. Most of the
macroinvertebrates
retained
following
leaf
litter
washing were identiﬁed to the genus level using
dichotomous keys (e.g., Merritt & Cummins, 1996;
Wiggins, 1996; Thorpe & Covich, 2001). Due to
difﬁculty
in
differentiating
aquatic
Diptera
and
Coleoptera, macroinvertebrates in these orders were
identiﬁed to the family level. Non-metric multidi-
mensional
scaling
(NMDS)
with
a
Bray-Curtis
distance measure provided a visual representation of
the macroinvertebrate community structure (PC-ORD
Version 4.02, MJM Software, Gleneden Beach,
Oregon, USA, 1999). Macroinvertebrate community
differences between harvest dates, sites, measurement
years, and site-measurement year combinations were
analyzed using a multi-response permutation proce-
dure (MRPP; McCune & Grace, 2002). Community
attributes including species evenness, richness, Shan-
non’s diversity index (H0), and Simpson’s diversity
index (D0) were also compared using the BACI
analysis method described in the next section.
Statistical analyses and BACI design
JMP-IN software was used for the majority of
statistical data analyses (Academic version 5.1.2,
SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA,
1989–2001). A type I error rate (a) of 0.05 was used
for all relevant analyses.
To test for effects of restoration on water quality
and chemistry, leaf litter decomposition, fungal
biomass, and macroinvertebrate community attributes
we used a before-after control-impact (BACI) design,
where ‘‘before-after’’ represented the pre- vs. post-
restoration measurements, and ‘‘control-impact’’ rep-
resented the above- vs. below-dam sites (Green,
1979; Smith, 2002). In this analysis signiﬁcant main
effects (site and year) indicate that either the sites are
different or that there is a temporal effect. A
signiﬁcant interaction term indicates that differences
between sites above and below the dam differed
before and after restoration. The interaction term
indicates whether restoration changed the relationship
between sites. Whereas most assessments employing
BACI designs test for differences among treatment
and control sites following disturbance, we were
testing if our sites became more similar after
restoration.
BACI designs are intended to reduce the statistical
problems and logical fallacies associated with pseu-
doreplication (Hurlburt, 1984) that are common in
freshwater ecology and restoration studies. Two-site,
single-measure BACI designs like the one used in this
study lack the power to infer that observed ‘‘before’’
to ‘‘after’’ changes in the ‘‘impact’’ site are due to the
disturbance or restoration being studied and not in
part to some other factor or combination of factors
(Underwood, 1992; Downes et al., 2002). Signiﬁcant
interaction terms indicate that differences between
treatments coincided with restoration but could be
due to other factors. The uniqueness of Fossil Creek
(as a perennial geothermal, travertine stream in an
arid region) and the location of the dam so close to
the headwaters eliminated any possibility of desig-
nating a similar reference stream and prohibited us
from creating additional ‘‘control’’ sites above the
dam. Our ability to replicate temporally was also
limited because the ﬁnal decision to decommission
the facility was made within a year of the actual
decommissioning, preventing collection of multiple
years of decomposition data prior to restoration.
Although this design limits our ability to make
statistical inference these constraints are typical of
restoration projects where scientists often need to
make tradeoffs between ideal experimental designs
and the need for assessments of management actions
(Bernhardt et al., 2005; e.g., Pollard & Reed, 2004;
Sethi et al., 2004). We also opted not to include
multiple downstream sites because lower reaches of
the stream were treated with antimycin A to remove

exotic ﬁsh. The sites in this experiment are upstream
of this manipulation (Weedman et al., 2005; Marks,
2007). Despite its limitations, such a BACI design is
recommended where disturbances or restorations
cannot be replicated across multiple sites and where
additional control sites are not available (Osenberg &
Schmitt, 1996), which is why the design was chosen
for this study.
Results
Water quality and chemistry
The interaction effect of site and year was signiﬁcant
for temperature (C), SpC (lS/cm), TdS (g/l), and
pH, but not for DO, NO3
-, or PO4
3- (Table 1).
Because measured values for NH4
? were all near or
below the detection limit, no statistical analyses were
run for the NH4
? data. In the case of temperature,
water below the dam warmed by 9C, from 11.6C in
2003 to 20.6C in 2005, while the temperature above
the dam remained at approximately 21.1C. TdS and
SpC concentrations below the dam in 2005 also
increased relative to their concentrations in 2003 and
in proportion to the above-dam values. The values for
pH above and below the dam in 2005 both decreased
relative to 2003 values, and pH remained lower above
in comparison to below the dam. As in 2003, DO
concentrations below the dam were higher than above
the dam in 2005. NO3
- concentrations increased and
PO4
3- concentrations decreased both above and
below the dam in 2005 relative to 2003, although
these changes were not signiﬁcant.
Leaf litter decomposition
Leaf litter decomposition was slower below the dam
both before and after restoration as indicated by a
signiﬁcant site effect (Fig. 2). There was no signif-
icant
year
effect
nor
was
there
a
signiﬁcant
interaction between site and year, indicating that
decomposition rates were relatively constant through
time both above and below the dam. There were also
no signiﬁcant differences in decomposition between
any leaf species/site/measurement year groupings of
factors except in A. oblongifolia litterbags located
above and below the dam in 2003 (F = 5.69,
P = 0.0181).
Fungal biomass
Fungal biomass was approximately 10 times lower
for litterbags located below the dam when compared
to above-dam values in 2003 (Fig. 2). Following dam
decommissioning, fungal biomass at the two sites
was nearly equal, and both values were approxi-
mately 30% greater than the average fungal biomass
on leaves located above the dam in 2003. The
interaction
of
site
with
year
was
signiﬁcant
(F = 8.45, P = 0.0053), indicating that fungal bio-
mass differed at the sites before but not after
restoration.

Aquatic macroinvertebrates
The macroinvertebrate community differed signiﬁ-
cantly
above
versus
below
the
dam
prior
to
restoration but began to converge following restora-
tion (Fig. 3). The MRPP for the site with year
interaction of macroinvertebrate community structure
was
signiﬁcant
(A = 0.1118,
P \ 0.001,
stress = 17.66, instability = 0.0005). This analysis
indicated little difference in macroinvertebrate com-
munity structure in the above-dam system between
measurement years. The locations on the NMDS
ordination of each litterbag from this site were
grouped closely to one another, with the ellipses
roughly the same size and centroid locations exhib-
iting a small community shift indicative of inter-
annual variation. The below-dam community, how-
ever, changed signiﬁcantly following restoration and
began to resemble the above-dam species structure.
Variation among replicates below the dam in 2003
was the highest of the four site-year combinations;
that is, the grouping of these litterbags was relatively
more dispersed in the NMDS ordination. Macroin-
vertebrate assemblages on litterbags below the dam
post-restoration (in 2005) exhibited a greater degree
of homogeneity than in 2003; however, the ordination
of macroinvertebrates collected below the dam in
2005 was still more dispersed than the above-dam
community. This suggests some time-lag between
restoration and complete recovery to above-dam
conditions, and emphasizes the need for long-term
monitoring in such research.

Site with year interactions for abundance and

were

signiﬁcant
at
the
5%
level
(F = 3.90, P = 0.0533 for abundance and F = 3.85,
P = 0.0546 for richness), but both showed a strong
trend of smaller differences between sites in 2005
relative to 2003. Abundance and richness were higher
above than below the dam in 2003 and remained so in
2005, but the difference was less pronounced.
There was a signiﬁcant site with year interaction
for Shannon’s diversity index (H0; Fig. 2), indicating
that diversity was lower below relative to above the
dam prior to restoration, but was similar at both sites
after ﬂow was restored. A similar trend was noted for
Simpson’s diversity index, although it was not
signiﬁcant (D0; F = 0.87, P = 0.3572).
Discussion
Following ﬂow restoration, Fossil Creek below the
dam appears to be returning to a state similar to the
above-dam
system.
Fungal
biomass
equalized
between sites six months following restoration and
macroinvertebrate communities on leaf packs below
the dam more closely resemble the above-dam
community. Leaf litter decomposition does not seem
to have been affected by a change in water ﬂow,
suggesting that ﬂow is not the driving force behind
decomposition in Fossil Creek.
Fungal biomass as a function of leaf litter AFDM
was signiﬁcantly lower below the dam than above the
dam prior to restoration but was nearly equal after
restoration, indicating that fungi may be more
capable of a rapid response to aquatic restoration
activities
than
macroinvertebrates.
Fungi
likely
responded positively to the increases in temperature
and ﬂow (Sanders & Webster, 1980, cited in Chauvet
& Suberkropp, 1998) although given this experimen-
tal design it is impossible to separate the independent
effects of these variables. The increase in fungal
biomass in the above-dam control site in 2005
compared to 2003 is likely attributable to meteoro-
logical phenomena rather than to a change in the
above-dam system; the winter of 2005 was abnor-
mally sunny, dry, and warm, whereas 2003 was very
snowy and colder (J. D. Muehlbauer, personal
observation).
The
reduced
macroinvertebrate
diversity
and
altered community structure differences that we
observed between the disturbed and free-ﬂowing
sites are consistent with those predicted by the Serial
Discontinuity Concept, where a dam in a low-order
stream should reduce diversity immediately below it
(Ward & Stanford, 1983). Although diversity, rich-
ness, and abundance increased below the dam, they
are still slightly lower than above the dam. This could
be due to a time lag or because other unstudied
biological or physical/environmental aspects of the
site are less conducive to macroinvertebrates. The
pre-restoration differences between sites are also
similar to a water diversion/dam system in Portugal
where a large degree of community variation was
found downstream of the dam and water impound-
ment (Cortes et al., 1998). Dams however do not
always reduce the diversity and density of macroin-
vertebrate communities (Casas et al., 2000) and can
even increase densities (Al-Lami et al., 1998).
Habitats below dams can be hospitable for macroin-
vertebrates if nutrient concentrations are elevated
below the dam (Casas et al., 2000) or current velocity
and substrate availability are more favorable (Al-
Lami et al., 1998), although this was not the case in
Fossil Creek. The rapid response of macroinverte-
brates to restoration is similar to that observed in a
dam removal in Wisconsin where macroinvertebrates
above a dam quickly shifted from a lentic to lotic
community (Stanley et al., 2002). In another Wis-
consin dam removal study, the greatest changes in the
macroinvertebrate community occurred nearest the
former dam site (Pollard & Reed, 2004), which also
corroborates the results of this research. The macr-
oinvertebrate
communities
that
we
observed
in
litterbags support a comprehensive four-year study
(pre- and post-decommissioning) on macroinverte-
brate
assemblages
on
multiple
substrates
and
locations in Fossil Creek showing that the macroin-
vertebrate community directly below the dam is
shifting towards a more pristine, above-dam state
(Dinger, 2006).
The lack of response in decomposition below the
dam is surprising given signiﬁcant differences in
macroinvertebrates, fungi, water ﬂow, and temper-
ature, which can be contributors to leaf litter
decomposition (Casas et al., 1994; Baldy & Gessner,
1997; Webster & Benﬁeld, 1986). These results are
in agreement with a study on a similar-order stream
diverted by a headwater dam in Spain that found no
difference
in
decomposition
rates
above
versus

below the dam during dam operation, although the
macroinvertebrate community did not change over
the course of that study (Casas et al., 2000). Given
the intense regional drought in 2005, these ﬁndings
are inconsistent with another study that suggests
water diversions and drought both cause a signiﬁ-
cant decrease in decomposition (Pinna et al., 2003);
possibly suggesting that decomposition should have
decreased above the dam while potentially increas-
ing below-dam from 2003 to 2005. Fossil Creek
however is spring-fed and base ﬂow is less sensitive
to inter-annual differences in precipitation. Increased
travertine deposition on the litterbags below the dam
post-restoration (J. D. Muehlbauer, personal obser-
vation) may have decreased decomposition rates.
This is in contrast to another study in Fossil Creek
that predicted increases in leaf litter decomposition
with
more
travertine
(Carter
&
Marks,
2007).
However, that study emphasized the effect of leaf
adhesion to travertine dams, which would both
expose and hold leaves in place for rapid microbial
and invertebrate decomposition. In this study, leaves
at the downstream site became completely encased
in travertine, potentially reducing leaf-surface avail-
ability to macroinvertebrates (Casas et al., 1994) or
minimizing fragmentation (Casas & Gessner, 1999;
LeRoy & Marks, 2006). This could have offset any
increases in decomposition rates caused by ﬂow
restoration.
Contrary to our prediction, leaf litter decomposi-
tion rates for the two species (P. fremontii and A.
oblongifolia) did not differ as they have in previous
studies (LeRoy & Marks, 2006). It is possible that the
timing of litterbag removal from the stream (at 10 and
75 days) inﬂuenced these results and may have
masked decomposition differences between sites as
well. At ten days, it is possible that a substantial
amount of time had not passed to allow decomposi-
tion to vary tremendously, while at 75 days it is
feasible that decomposition had reached an asymp-
tote and had slowed to almost zero. Decomposition
rate comparisons among treatments were unbiased
because leaves were removed from both sites on the
same dates, but having additional removal dates near
these times and in the middle of the range likely
would have been helpful in more conﬁdently pre-
senting these results. In fact, the experiment had
included a plan for an intermediate removal date that
had to be cancelled due to inclement weather.
Conclusion
The two-site, single-measure BACI design limits our
power to infer that the changes and site with year
interactions observed are due to restoration alone and
not to some combination of factors. Nevertheless,
these data indicate that aspects of stream ecosystems
such as macroinvertebrate and fungal communities
can be reversed quickly when major components of the
disturbance are alleviated. These results are consistent
with a long-term study showing that macroinverte-
brates in Fossil Creek rebounded very quickly from
treatment with antimycin A, where the macroinverte-
brate assemblage was decimated but within 6 months
most
species
returned
to
pre-disturbance
levels
(Dinger, 2006). Water was diverted from Fossil Creek
for almost a century, yet two important guilds of
decomposers seem to have rebounded within 6 months
of ﬂow restoration. Continual monitoring of these sites
and future studies following the pending removal of
the dam, slated for 2009, will be valuable in assessing
dam effects not solely accounted for by water ﬂow
restoration. Such effects, particularly the rapid release
of sediments deposited above the dam, are thought to
have a major inﬂuence on ecosystems below dams
(Stanley & Doyle, 2003). Of course, given the extreme
variation in streams and dams and the ecosystems in
which they are found (Poff & Hart, 2002; Riggsbee
et al., 2007), more experiments are necessary not only
in Fossil Creek, but also in other systems. This would
allow policy makers to understand the ecological
implications of dam decommissionings and removals
on a more practical regional and dam-size scale
(Hughes et al., 1990). Such knowledge would also
beneﬁt the many, similar restoration projects already
in action or in the planning stages (Heinz Center, 2002;
Bernhardt et al., 2005). Responses to dam decommis-
sioning are likely to depend on the type and magnitude
of disturbance created by the dam (Poff & Hart, 2002)
and the ability for restoration to mitigate speciﬁc
disturbances. Here, we show that mitigating one aspect
of the disturbance, ﬂow, has the potential to quickly
reverse some of the differences between pristine and
disturbed sites.
