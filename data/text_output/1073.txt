Field Notes
Ecology Group: Summer
Field Projects
After making several adjustments to
this years’ ﬁeld season due to Covid-
19 protocols and safety concerns,
ﬁeld data collection began at sites
near Flagstaff in June. After more
practice and better understanding of
safety protocols, ERI crews deployed
to more distant research sites to
ﬁnish the season.

on two recently awarded grants, to
continue the Chip n Ship project with
a follow-up study, and to have
recently ﬁnalized the publication of
several wood and biomass supply
studies for northern Arizona.
Human Dimensions 
The ERI is exploring the different
ways in which wildﬁres affect Arizona
residents through multiple studies
associated with wildﬁres in the
Flagstaff area. In 2019, the ERI
conducted a survey with the NAU
School of Forestry to understand
public experiences with the 2019
Museum Fire near Flagstaff. 
Native American Forest
and Rangeland Program
Staff are working to provide ﬁrewood
from restoration projects to tribes
impacted by the Navajo Generating
Station closure through the “Wood
for Life” project. They are also
prepping for the 2021 Tribal Forestry
Student Summit to be held on the
NAU campus.

Science Delivery
Covid-era Science Delivery in Action:
Differentiating pinyon juniper
woodland, savannah and shrub. 
ERI worked closely with Kaibab
National Forest staff, including soil
scientist Micah Kiesow and ﬁre
ecologist Alex Spannuth, to apply a
pinyon juniper woodland
classiﬁcation scheme to the Tusayan
and Williams ranger districts.
“It is impossible to have a conversation with any
US Forest Service employee about restoration
without some reference to ERI’s work.”

Mobile LiDAR Fly-through Video
Researchers at NAU-ERI are using drones, airplanes and state-of-
the-art laser scanning technology to conduct forest assessments around
Arizona’s C.C. Cragin Reservoir. The assessments will help inform future forest
restoration projects that aim to improve forest health conditions, mitigate the
potential for catastrophic ﬁre in the area and protect one of the state’s critical
watersheds. This video was created by the project’s principal investigator and
ERI Executive Director Andrew Sánchez Meador. It is a ﬂy-through of a mobile
lidar data set showing what can be seen in the data—individual trees are
uniquely colored, and the surface/ground  points, which include downed wood,
are all grey and several logs are clearly visible.
