Abstract—We examined forest structure, tree recruitment, and spatial pattern over 
a 130-year period on cinder soils in northern Arizona. Data were collected from a 
3.24 ha permanent, stem-mapped plot established in 1909. This site is unique in that 
it represents ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws. var. scopulorum Engelm.) grow-
ing on black cinder soils, which are of limited extent in the Southwest. Tree diameter, 
tree density and spatial data reconstructed from 1874 and actual measurements from 
1909 and 2004 were compared, and the current stand age-structure of living trees 
was examined. Unlike most studies of stand dynamics in the Southwest, this site has 
experienced little change in structure or spatial pattern between 1874 and 2004. This 
difference is thought to reflect the unique environmental conditions associated with 
black cinder soils.
Introduction
In the past two decades, much attention has been given to understanding the 
dramatic structural and functional changes observed in the ponderosa pine forests 
of northern Arizona (Allen and others 2002, Covington and Moore 1994, Fulé and 
others 1997, Mast and others 1999, Moore and others 2004). While it is widely 
accepted that these changes have culminated in forest conditions consistent with 
catastrophic disturbances and widespread degradation of these ecosystems (Allen 
and others 2002), few studies have been able to quantify long-term (100+ years) 
temporal and spatial changes in forest structure (Moore and others 2004).

The objective of this study was to quantify changes in forest structure, tree re-
cruitment, and associated spatial patterns between fire exclusion (~1874, Sánchez 
Meador and others 2008a) and contemporary conditions (2004). To do so, we ana-
lyzed forest structural data (tree size, tree density) and spatial pattern on a permanent 
plot at three points in time: onset of fire exclusion (1874), plot establishment (1909), 
and contemporary (2004). We also analyzed tree recruitment patterns as evidenced 
in spatial maps of regeneration from 1909 and 2004 and in the current stand age-
structure. A particularly unusual aspect of this plot is that it occurs on a regionally 
unique parent material, cinder soils.
Methods
This study was conducted on a 3.24 ha (8 acre) site, denoted as COCS4A, located 
approximately 20 km northeast of Flagstaff, Arizona on the Coconino National 
Forest (35° 16.88’N, 111° 32.35’W). This plot is on the Fort Valley Experimental 
Forest unit east of Flagstaff, AZ (Unit 4) near Doney Park, and has also been re-
ferred to as the Cinder Hills or Cinder Plot, Greenlaw Plot, or Old Caves Crater 
plot. The plot was selectively harvested in 1909 (prior to plot establishment mea-
surements) and in 1967.
The elevation of the study site is approximately 2,050 meters above sea level, 
mean annual total precipitation is approximately 430 mm, and mean annual average 
temperature is 7.6° C (Western Regional Climate Center 2006). The parent material 
and soils of the site are typical of the San Francisco Volcanic Field (Tanaka and oth-
ers 1986) with a surface layer of volcanic ejecta (cinders) ranging in thickness from 
2.5–60 cm. The Terrestrial Ecosystem Survey (TES) classifies the soil type of the 
site as ashy-skeletal, frigid Vintrandic Ustochrepts, which are extremely cindery 
sand loams (TES Map Unit 512, Miller and others 1995). The overstory vegetation 
is ponderosa pine with scattered pinyon pine (Pinus edulis Engelm.). The under-
story vegetation consists primarily of dispersed perennial bunchgrasses.
We used the original 1909 survey and forest inventory methods to reestablish the 
plots (see Moore and others 2004 for details). Methods used to map spatial locations 
of trees (x,y coordinates), collect age data, reconstruct plot conditions at fire exclu-
sion, and conduct spatial analyses are outlined by Sánchez Meador and others (2008a, 
2008b). In addition, ages were corrected for the time to reach 40 cm height by adding 
ten years (Cormier 1990). With the exception of analyses of recruitment, all analy-
ses were conducted on live trees ≥ 9.14 cm diameter at breast height (1.37 m above 
ground level). We determined stand structural attributes (mean tree size, trees per ha, 
basal area, quadratic mean diameter, and seedlings per ha) at three points in time: 
onset of fire exclusion (1874), plot establishment (1909), and contemporary (2004).
Spatial analyses included a first-order point pattern analysis of nearest neighbor 
distances (Clark and Evans’ R [Clark and Evans 1954]) to facilitate interpretation 
of changes in spatial pattern over time at the plot level and second-order point 
pattern analyses to examine changes at various spatial scales. Two second-order 
analyses were utilized: 1) Ripley’s K(t) univariate analysis (Ripley 1976, 1977) to 
examine changes in spatial patterns with scale of observation for each stand struc-
tural scenario, and 2) Ripley’s bivariate analysis (Ripley 1976, 1977) to quantify 
recruitment-establishment patterns of seedlings with respect to overstory trees.

Results
Stand structural and spatial conditions were similar in 1874 and 1909 to those 
observed in 2004 (Table 1). The 1909 group-selection harvest reduced the stand 
density (tree per hectare) by about a third and stand basal area by half, but had 
little effect on mean nearest neighbor distance. Contemporary age data revealed 
an uneven-aged structure with three main cohorts, centered in the mid-1800s, the 
early 1900s and in the mid-1900s. These pulses roughly correspond to periods of 
increased precipitation (Figure 1).
Live trees were clumped in all three scenarios (Figure 2). Ripley’s univariate 
K analyses detected subtle differences among time periods in intensity and scale 
(Figure 3). In 1874 and 1909, trees were clumped at all scales, with maximum in-
tensity at a distance of 10 m. In 2004, trees were clumped with maximum intensity 
at 6 m, but only out to 30 m, after which they were randomly arranged.
Seedling recruitment was spatially patterned at smaller scales in 1909 than 2004 
(Figure 4). In 1909, seedlings were attracted to overstory trees up to six m away, 
whereas in 2004, seedlings were attracted to overstory trees up to 17 m away.

Discussion
The most important finding in this study is that unlike most other studies in 
southwestern ponderosa pine (Cooper 1960, Covington and Moore 1994, Fulé and 
others 1997, Mast and others 1999, Moore and others 2004), forest structure on this 
black cinder site is largely unchanged from the onset of fire exclusion (1874) until 
2004. Ponderosa pine stands on this study site have lower tree densities, yet higher 
tree growth and greater overall tree size compared with other stands on historical 
permanent plots in the Southwest (Moore and others 2004). Other studies have also 
noted greater average growth of trees on volcanic cinder soils in northern Arizona, 
and attribute it to a number of factors including: 1) minimal herbaceous competition, 
2) deep subsoils that have moisture retaining layers, and/or 3) loose soils that facili-
tate development of extensive, branched tree root systems (Abella and Covington 
2006, Colton 1932, Haasis 1921). In addition, we did not see the large population 
explosion of pine seedlings in 1919, as observed in many studies across northern 
Arizona (Savage and others 1996). Originally, we suspected that the harsh environ-
ment of the cinder soils may have prevented seedling establishment, but later we 
learned that a cone-weevil outbreak that occurred at this site in 1918 prevented the 
large seed and seedling crop seen in other areas around Flagstaff (Pearson 1923).
The spatial pattern has remained aggregated throughout the site’s recorded 
history, and this is likely due to the patterns of pine recruitment. Recruitment is 
positively associated with the location of overstory trees. The existing tree canopy 
provides shade and increased soil moisture, which increases the chances of pine 
seedling survival (Stein and Kimberling 2003), especially on these more inhospi-
table surface soils (Abella and Covington 2006).
Summary
Ponderosa pine stands that occur on black cinders parent material account for a 
small proportion of the Coconino National Forest in northern Arizona (Miller and 
others 1995). Even though these stands do not occupy much area, they are unique. 
The uniqueness of this forest type was recognized in 1909 when G.A. Pearson es-
tablished a FVEF East Unit (Unit 4) and several permanent plots to describe this 
forest type. We remeasured these permanent plots in 2004 and compared the for-
est structure (age, size, density) in 2004 to that in 1909 and to plots reconstructed 
to 1874. We found that the forest structure had not changed greatly from 1874 to 
2004.
