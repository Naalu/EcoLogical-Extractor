ABSTRACT 
 
 
ENVIRONMENTAL AND VEGETATIONAL GRADIENTS ON AN ARIZONA 
PONDEROSA PINE LANDSCAPE: IMPLICATIONS FOR 
ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION 
 
SCOTT R. ABELLA 
 
 
This research was performed in northern Arizona ponderosa pine (Pinus 
ponderosa) forests to enhance the ecological basis for restoration projects currently 
ongoing in these forests.  My objectives were to: (i) develop a forest ecosystem 
classification on a 110,000-ha ponderosa pine landscape, (ii) determine geomorphic and 
soil gradients associated with the distribution of plant communities on this landscape, (iii) 
assess potential contributions of the soil seed bank for reestablishing understory 
communities, and (iv) determine understory responses to forest-floor manipulations in an 
existing ecological restoration experiment.  I identified 10 landscape ecosystem types on 
this landscape, ranging from black cinders/Phacelia ecosystems low in available moisture 
and total N, to mesic basalt/Festuca and aspen/Lathyrus ecosystems.  Distribution of 
plant communities was chiefly correlated with soil texture and resource levels reflecting 
influences of parent materials.  Soil seed bank composition was partly ecosystem-
specific, and was dominated by graminoids and short-lived forbs such as aspen fleabane 
(Erigeron divergens).  I did not detect any short-term (2 year) treatment effects on 
understory vegetation in the forest-floor manipulation experiment.

CHAPTER 1 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
 
 
This research was undertaken to provide ecological information in support of 
efforts aimed at restoring northern Arizona ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests.  
Since European settlement of northern Arizona beginning ca. 1875, most of these forests 
have been subjected to heavy livestock grazing and to exclusion of historically frequent 
(< 10 yr on average) surface fires (Covington et al. 1994, Fulé et al. 1997, Allen et al. 
2002).  As a result, contemporary forests are dominated by dense small-diameter trees, 
sharply contrasting with the open stand structures and productive understories of 
presettlement forests (Cooper 1960, Moore et al. 1999).  These dense contemporary 
forests are considered to be outside a range of natural variability thought to characterize 
presettlement forests (Moore et al. 1999, Allen et al. 2002).  Ecological restoration in 
these forests seeks to approximately return fire regimes, tree structure, understory 
vegetation, and ecosystem functions to within a range of variability consistent with these 
forests’ evolutionary environment (Covington et al. 1997, Moore et al. 1999).  
Restoration treatments in ponderosa pine forests chiefly include mechanical thinning of 
small-diameter trees and reintroducing surface fire through prescribed burning (e.g., 
Lynch et al. 2000, Fulé et al. 2001).  Particularly for understory vegetation, supplemental 
treatments such as exotic species removal or seeding of native species may be needed on 
some sites to meet ecological restoration objectives (Covington et al. 1997, Abella 2004).   
 
All research in this dissertation was performed in ponderosa pine forests 
surrounding the city of Flagstaff in northern Arizona, which has been a center of 

 
 
2
ecological restoration efforts in southwestern ponderosa pine forests (e.g., Moore et al. 
1999, Fulé et al. 2001).  The general objectives of my research on this landscape were to: 
(i) develop a forest ecosystem classification, (ii) identify environmental gradients 
associated with plant community distribution, (iii) determine soil seed bank composition 
and its response to fire-related cues, and (iv) measure understory responses to forest-floor 
treatments in an existing ecological restoration experiment.  Studies pertaining to each of 
these objectives are presented in four independent manuscript chapters following a 
literature review chapter.  The literature review summarizes applications of ecosystem 
classification and forest site classification in southwestern United States forests.  The 
dissertation concludes with a chapter synthesizing major conclusions of this research and 
identifies topics for future research.  My emphasis in all chapters is on increasing our 
understanding of the ecology of the ponderosa pine landscapes we are trying to restore, 
and suggesting how results relate to applied ecological restoration.

CHAPTER 2 
 
 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
Introduction 
 
A major challenge confronting restorationists in southwestern United States 
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests is developing strategies for restoring large 
landscapes.  In Arizona and New Mexico alone, ponderosa pine-dominated landscapes 
occupy more than 3.4 million hectares (Brown 1994).  These landscapes also are 
heterogeneous, containing arrays of soil orders, topography, and plant communities 
(Schubert 1974, Brown 1994).  Sites within landscapes exhibit different levels of 
ecological properties, suggesting that ecological restoration is most accurate if treatments 
are based on site-specific knowledge of ecological properties (Covington et al. 1997).  
Treating each site as if it were entirely unique, however, would present a daunting 
challenge for estimating levels of many past and present ecological properties, 
developing treatments, and monitoring treatment outcomes on large landscapes.  
Furthermore, a tenet of ecosystem management is that we need to manage landscapes as 
wholes, not as collections of independent points (Franklin 1993, Covington et al. 1999).   
 
Partitioning landscapes into classification units comprised of collections of 
similar sites has a long history in ecological research and management, including plant 
community classification (Whittaker 1962), site index grouping (Carmean 1975), soil 
surveys (Jones 1969), and ecosystem classification (Cajander 1926).  If mapped, these 
classifications allow their variable(s) of interest to be extrapolated from specific points to 
other mapping units within classification strata.  A certain degree of error is inherent in 

 
 
5
this extrapolation for several reasons, because (i) ecological systems often occur on 
continuums, meaning any classification will not be perfect, (ii) accuracy depends on how 
well a given variable of interest is correlated with the classification, (iii) levels of 
variables and correlations with the classification system may change through time, and 
(iv) other reasons such as compounding of measurement errors during extrapolation.  
Despite these limitations, classification is a practical tool for communicating information 
about numerous sites in landscapes to facilitate their management (Whittaker 1962). 
 
Ecosystem classification, also called ecological land classification, ecological site 
typing, and other terms, is becoming increasingly popular in the scientific literature as a 
means to partition landscapes into relatively homogenous ecosystem units (e.g., Barnes et 
al. 1982, Hix and Pearcy 1997, Goebel et al. 2001).  Inherently multivariate and 
interdisciplinary, ecosystem classification identifies sites exhibiting similar abiotic 
(geomorphology and soils) and vegetational characteristics (Pregitzer and Barnes 1984, 
Archambault et al. 1990, Meilleur et al. 1994).  The main difference between ecosystem 
classification and traditional plant community classification is that ecosystem 
classification emphasizes persistent abiotic ecosystem components, with vegetation of 
secondary importance (Spies and Barnes 1985, McNab et al. 1999, Palik et al. 2000).  
Like any classification system (Pregitzer et al. 2001), ecosystem classification is not 
designed to simultaneously meet all the estimation objectives for a landscape (Nolet et al. 
1995).  However, the intuitive appeal of studying landscapes as reoccurring ecosystem 
mosaics comprised of interrelated environmental complexes and plant communities, has 
gained ecosystem classification’s general acceptance in the scientific literature (e.g., 
Barnes et al. 1982, Host et al. 1988, Palik et al. 2003).   

 
 
6
 
In this chapter, I summarize (i) examples where ecosystem classification has been 
used to estimate ecological properties across landscapes, and (ii) site classifications in 
southwestern United States forests.  Ecosystem classification has been little developed to 
date in southwestern forests.  Given the large landscapes needing restoration in 
southwestern forests and the range of ecological properties useful to estimate to enhance 
the knowledge base for restoration (Covington et al. 1997), ecosystem classification may 
be particularly useful in the future in the southwestern United States.         
Ecosystem Classification Applications 
 
Ecosystem classification automatically provides baseline soils, geomorphic, and 
vegetation data through its development, and the classification subsequently provides a 
useful ecosystem framework for studying a variety of ecological properties among 
ecosystems.  Diverse studies, ranging from predicting distributions of archaeological sites 
(Ferone et al. 1997), estimating ecosystem-specific nutrient cycling (Zak and Pregitzer 
1990), reconstructing presettlement forest composition through General Land Survey 
records (Fralish et al.1991), and prioritizing ecological restoration (Palik et al. 2000), 
have been undertaken within and made more accurate by an ecosystem classification 
framework (Table 2.1).  In the following sections, I present examples where ecosystem 
classification has been applied to estimate ecological properties relevant to ecosystem 
management.

Nitrogen Cycling 
 
In a series of studies, Zak et al. (1986, 1989) and Zak and Pregitzer (1990) 
compared N cycling among nine ecosystem types occurring along soil texture and 
drainage gradients on glacial landforms of a forested northern Michigan landscape.  
Potential net N mineralization averaged about 50 µg N g-1 in dry oak (Quercus) 
ecosystems on outwash plains or on moraines without fine-textured soil banding (Zak et 
al. 1989).  Mineralization was sharply higher in two sugar maple (Acer saccharum) 
ecosystems on moraine landforms with fine-textured bands, averaging 93-128 µg N g-1.  
Potential net nitrification averaged < 5 µg N g-1 in 8/9 ecosystems, but averaged 45 µg N 
g-1 in a moist Acer saccharum–Osmorhiza ecosystem.  Litterfall N concentrations of trees 
that grew in multiple ecosystems also differed among ecosystems for several species.  
Northern red oak (Quercus rubra) litterfall, for example, averaged 0.8% N in outwash 
plain ecosystems compared to 1.1% N in moist morainal ecosystems (Zak et al. 1986).  
Net N mineralization was strongly correlated with overstory biomass (r2 = 0.82) and 
annual biomass increment (r2 = 0.85), both of which displayed predictable patterns 
among ecosystem types (Host et al. 1988).   
These studies illustrated that ecosystem properties such as nutrient cycling, 
species composition, and productivity were interrelated with each other, and with the 
glacial landforms and soil textural properties forming the foundation of the ecosystem 
classification.  The authors also emphasized that variability in N cycling can be as high 
among ecosystems within a region as between regions (Zak et al. 1989).  They 
hypothesized that some of the nine ecosystem types within their study landscape were N-
limited, whereas others were not.

Tree Mortality 
 
On a Georgia Coastal Plain landscape, Palik and Pederson (1996) found that 
causes of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) mortality were partly correlated with site factors 
associated with different ecosystem types (Goebel et al. 2001).  Lightning mortality was 
most frequent on coarse-textured, excessively drained xeric sites.  The authors 
hypothesized that pines on these xeric sites were more likely to die after being struck by 
lightning because they were already stressed by low moisture levels.  Windthrow 
mortality, in contrast, was most frequent on sites in low topographic positions with high 
water tables.  Rooting depth was restricted on these sites, increasing longleaf pine’s 
susceptibility to windthrow. 
Tree Growth 
 
Differences in tree growth have routinely been found among classified 
ecosystems.  For example, pignut hickory (Carya glabra) site index50 ranged from 14-23 
meters across six ecosystem types in Indiana’s Hoosier National Forest (Jose and 
Gillespie 1997).  Annual woody biomass production was lowest in a dry-slope ecosystem 
(2127 kg ha-1 yr-1) and highest in a bottomland ecosystem (3353 kg ha-1 yr-1).  
Differences in tree growth among classified ecosystems also have been reported in 
Wisconsin hardwood forests (Hix 1988), Michigan jack pine (Pinus banksiana; Kashian 
et al. 2003) and hardwood forests (Host et al. 1988), Georgia longleaf pine savannas 
(Mitchell et al. 1999), Arizona ponderosa pine forests (Abella 2005), and in other areas.  
Because ecosystem classification is based on environmental variables associated with soil 
moisture and nutrient levels affecting tree growth, it is not surprising that ecosystem 
classification has strongly predicted forest productivity on a range of landscapes.

Plant Species Diversity 
 
On a 4000-ha northern Michigan forested landscape, Lapin and Barnes (1995) 
found that Shannon’s diversity index ranged from 0.61 in excessively drained, nutrient-
poor glacial outwash ecosystems, to 2.21 in loamy, nutrient-rich moist ecosystems.  Plant 
diversity thus appeared positively correlated with soil-resource levels, well captured by 
the ecosystem framework.  Kirkman et al. (2004) compared Shannon’s diversity among 
ecosystem types on a 13,000-ha longleaf pine landscape previously classified by Goebel 
et al. (2001).  These authors concluded that species diversity was affected both by 
environmental factors and prescribed burning frequency.  Interestingly, the authors noted 
that ecosystem types were correlated with both these factors.  Unproductive ecosystems 
were not burned frequently because of slow fuel accumulation, and seasonally flooded 
ecosystems also were not burned frequently because of limited periods of dry fuels.          
Presettlement Forest Composition 
 
Fralish et al. (1991) reconstructed 1806-1807 (presettlement) forest composition 
in the Illinois Shawnee Hills from General Land Office records and related these witness 
tree data to an ecosystem classification.  Presettlement composition closely corresponded 
with the present-day ecosystem classification.  Post oak (Quercus stellata), for example, 
was abundant in dry ecosystems on rocky, south-facing slopes.  Drainages cut in 
sandstone bedrock consisted of mesic hardwoods such as tulip-poplar (Liriodendron 
tulipifera).  Reconstructed presettlement basal area ranged from 9 m2 ha-1 on rocky south 
slopes to 22 m2 ha-1 in drainages.  Fralish et al. (1991) also sampled contemporary old-
growth forests on these ecosystem types, and noted that contemporary composition 
differed to a certain extent from presettlement composition likely because of fire 

 
 
11
suppression or other factors.  Similar to presettlement forest composition, however, 
contemporary composition was strongly ecosystem specific.  This illustrates an important 
principle that a given ecosystem type can support different plant communities at different 
times.  These data also illustrate that the ecosystem classification viably predicted forest 
composition for a 200-year period, owing to the persistence of the topographic and soil 
factors on which the ecosystem framework was based.    
Forest Site Classification in the Southwest 
 
Early site classification efforts in the Southwest focused on grouping sites 
according to soil surveys, site index, or generalized topographic features or vegetation 
types (Jones 1969, Leven et al. 1972).  Clary et al. (1966), for example, suggested 
stratifying sites by soil series and topographic position for estimating forage production 
in ponderosa pine forests of northern Arizona’s Beaver Creek watershed.  Radloff and 
Betters (1978) and Omi et al. (1979) later suggested using multivariate statistics for 
grouping sites on Colorado and California landscapes.   
Habitat typing (Daubenmire 1952) likely has been the most extensively developed 
site classification method in southwestern forests (Muldavin et al. 1990).  Habitat typing 
is basically plant community classification chiefly of late-successional vegetation, and 
soil properties typically are not measured or only qualitatively assessed (e.g., Pfister and 
Arno 1980, Hanks et al. 1983).  Barnes et al. (1998) concisely summarized the history 
and nature of habitat typing, and noted that habitat typing has made major contributions 
to our understanding of vegetation ecology.  Cook (1996) discussed some assumptions 
and problems with traditional habitat typing, particularly about climax vegetation 
concepts on which habitat typing rests.  Habitat types are not necessarily synonymous 

 
 
12
with ecosystem types because multiple climax vegetation types may occur on similar 
environmental complexes, and some environmental complexes may not support climax 
vegetation due to recurrent disturbances (Cook 1996, Barnes et al. 1998).  It is not 
necessarily appropriate to say that one classification is better than another, because 
ecosystem classification and habitat typing classify different things (Barnes et al. 1998).   
Two qualities that I believe make ecosystem classification particularly useful in 
the context of southwestern forest restoration are: (i) Ecosystem classification is based on 
semi-permanent abiotic landscape features, thought to change relatively little during 
vegetation transitions or forest succession.  (ii) By incorporating quantitative soil and 
environmental variables, ecosystem classification better explains vegetation-environment 
ecological relationships and mechanisms than classification based strictly on plant 
community characteristics.  Ecosystem classification’s utility also can be enhanced if 
successional trajectories in the presence or absence of disturbance can be developed for 
individual ecosystem types (Kirkman et al. 2000).  Land managers then have ecosystem 
and current vegetation maps available for management planning (Palik et al. 2000). 
Terrestrial ecosystem surveys (TES), developed for several southwestern national 
forests since the late 1980s (Ganey and Benoit 2002), also deserve mention for site 
classification.  These surveys provide map unit descriptions similar to traditional USDA 
soil surveys, with the exceptions that TES classifies soils only to the family level and 
provides minimal soil profile descriptions, but lists expected understory species (e.g., 
U.S. Forest Service 1995).  It is unclear, however, how the species lists were obtained 
(U.S. Forest Service 1995).  To a user, TES may seem akin to traditional soil surveys, 
just termed differently.  It is well-established that ecosystem types typically do not equate 

 
 
13
with soil taxonomic units (e.g., Host et al. 1988, Abella et al. 2003), although soil survey 
data can greatly assist development of ecosystem classifications.  There are no known 
published TES and ecosystem classification comparisons, which are needed to assess the 
role of TES in southwestern forest site classification.

FOREST ECOSYSTEMS OF AN ARIZONA PINUS PONDEROSA LANDSCAPE: 
MULTIFACTOR CLASSIFICATION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR 
ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION 
 
ABSTRACT 
Aim I developed an ecosystem classification on a 110,000-ha Arizona Pinus ponderosa 
P. & C. Lawson (ponderosa pine) landscape to support ecological restoration of these 
forests.  Specific objectives included identifying key environmental variables 
constraining ecosystem distribution, and comparing plant species composition, richness, 
and tree growth among ecosystems. 
Location The Coconino National Forest and the Northern Arizona University Centennial 
Forest, near the city of Flagstaff in northern Arizona, USA. 
Methods I sampled geomorphology, soils, and vegetation on 66, 0.05-ha plots in open 
stands containing trees of pre-European settlement (ca. 1875) origin, and on 26 plots in 
dense postsettlement stands.  Using cluster analysis and ordination of vegetation and 
environment matrices, I classified plots into ecosystem types internally similar in 
environmental and vegetational characteristics.  
Results I identified 10 ecosystem types, ranging from dry, black cinders/Phacelia 
ecosystems to moist aspen/Lathyrus ecosystems.  Texture, organic C, and other soil 
properties reflecting effects of parent materials structured ecosystem distribution across 
the landscape, with geomorphology locally important.  Species composition also was 
ecosystem-specific, with C3 Festuca arizonica Vasey (Arizona fescue), for instance, 

 
 
21
abundant in mesic basalt/Festuca ecosystems.  Mean P. ponderosa diameter increments 
ranged from 2.3-4.3 mm yr-1 across ecosystems in old-growth stands, and the ecosystem 
classification was robust in dense postsettlement stands.  
Main conclusions Several lines of evidence suggest that although species composition 
may have been altered since settlement, the same basic ecosystems occurred on this 
landscape in presettlement forests, providing reference information for ecological 
restoration.  Red cinders/Bahia ecosystems historically were rare and > 30% of their area 
has burned by crown fires since 1950, indicating priority could be given to restoring this 
ecosystem’s remaining mapping units.  Ecosystem turnover occurs at broad extents on 
this landscape, and restoration must accordingly operate across large areas to encompass 
ecosystem diversity.  By incorporating factors driving ecosystem composition, this 
ecosystem classification represents a framework for estimating spatial variation in 
ecological properties relevant to ecological restoration.       
Keywords 
Ecosystem classification, geomorphology, soil, terrestrial ecosystem survey, 
vegetation-environment relationships, reference conditions, species richness. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Geomorphology and soils vary across forest landscapes, forming mosaics of 
environmental complexes differing in productivities and capabilities for supporting plant 
communities (Hix, 1988; Archambault et al., 1990; Host & Pregitzer, 1992).  Ecosystem 
classification is a tool for identifying interrelationships among environmental variables 
forming environmental complexes, discerning gradients constraining vegetation 

 
 
22
distribution and productivity, and classifying volumetric environment-vegetation units 
into landscape ecosystems to facilitate ecosystem-specific management (Barnes et al., 
1982; McNab et al., 1999).  Goebel et al. (2001), for example, distinguished 21 
ecosystem types along soil texture, drainage, and topographic gradients on an 11,000-ha 
southeastern USA Pinus palustris P. Mill. (longleaf pine) landscape.  Palik et al. (2000) 
then used the ecosystem classification to develop models for prioritizing ecosystem-
specific restoration based on the historical and current rarity of different ecosystems.   
 
While ecosystem classification is increasingly being developed and utilized in 
eastern USA forests (e.g., Lapin & Barnes, 1995; McNab et al., 1999; Abella et al., 
2003), little ecosystem classification or soil-site research has been published for vast 
southwestern USA Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson (ponderosa pine) forests.  
Vegetation-based habitat classifications (Hanks et al., 1983; Muldavin et al., 1990) or soil 
or landform type classifications (Leven et al., 1972) have been more common in these 
forests, although recently the US Forest Service has published Terrestrial Ecosystem 
Surveys (TES) for several southwestern national forests (see Ganey & Benoit, 2002).  
These TES land classifications provide georeferenced maps and soil classification data 
similar to eastern US soil surveys (US Forest Service, 1995).  Although TES has been 
extensively developed for southwestern P. ponderosa forests, there are no published TES 
and ecosystem classification comparisons.  Ecosystem integrity in these forests has 
declined since settlement (ca. 1875), largely because of fire exclusion, increases in tree 
density, widespread crown fires, and other factors.  Scientific consensus has emerged that 
these forests urgently need extensive ecological restoration, primarily including tree 
thinning and reintroduction of frequent surface fire (Covington et al., 1994; Moore et al., 

 
 
23
1999; Allen et al., 2002).  Developing ecosystem classification in southwestern P. 
ponderosa forests and comparisons with TES may be timely for assisting ecosystem-
specific ecological restoration.  
 
I undertook this study to develop a multifactor ecosystem classification on a 
110,000-ha northern Arizona USA Pinus ponderosa landscape.  Specific objectives 
included identifying primary environmental and vegetational gradients and their 
interrelationships associated with ecosystem distribution, comparing variables such as 
tree growth among classified ecosystems, and providing examples of applications for 
ecological restoration and hypothesis generation for future research.      
METHODS 
Study area 
This study was performed between 1920-2660 m elevations in the Northern Arizona 
University Centennial Forest and the north half of the Coconino National Forest near the 
city of Flagstaff, AZ (Fig. 3.1).  Pinus ponderosa is the dominant tree species and forms 
extensive pure stands, but sometimes occurs with Quercus gambelii Nutt. (Gambel oak) 
or Populus tremuloides Michx. (trembling aspen).  Precipitation increases and 
temperatures decrease from east to west across the study area, with precipitation ranging 
from 42-56 cm yr-1, snowfall from 152-233 cm yr-1, and maximum mean daily 
temperatures from 15.7-17.5oC (Western Regional Climate Center, Reno, NV, USA).  
Topography is primarily flat or undulating (slope gradients < 10%), occasionally 
punctuated by cinder cones, ravines, and low hills.  Volcanic activity has been 
widespread, with the most recent eruptions occurring ca. 900 years ago in the Sunset 
Crater Volcanic Field in the northeastern part of the study area (Moore et al., 1976).  Soil 

 
 
24
parent materials include basalt, volcanic cinders, benmoreite, mixed igneous rocks, and 
limestone (Welch & Klemmedson, 1975).  Major soil subgroups are Typic and Udic 
Argiborolls, Typic and Mollic Eutroboralfs, Typic Ustorthents, and Vitrandic Ustochrepts 
(US Forest Service, 1995).  Lightning-ignited surface fires in presettlement forests on 
average occurred at least once every 10 years, maintaining open stand structures (Fulé et 
al., 1997).  Most of the study area, however, has sustained fire exclusion, timber harvest, 
and heavy livestock grazing since settlement, which may have influenced contemporary 
ground-flora composition in some areas (Abella, 2004).     
Site selection 
I used a digital TES map (US Forest Service, 1995) in a geographic information system 
to randomly select six mapping units for sampling in each of 11 TES types (55, 500, 513, 
523, 536, 551, 558, 570, 582, 585, and 611) encompassing a range of soils.  I sampled a 
0.05-ha (20 m × 25 m) plot in each mapping unit in areas exhibiting open canopies, 
relatively intact understories, and no apparent major recent disturbance.  Areas dominated 
by presettlement-origin trees most frequently met these criteria.  These 66 open-canopy 
plots were used to develop the ecosystem classification, and I sampled an additional 26 
plots in dense postsettlement-origin stands in 536, 570, and 585 TES mapping units to 
ascertain classification viability in dense stands.  These stands typically exceeded 1000 
trees ha-1, in contrast to typical densities of < 150 trees ha-1 in presettlement-origin stands.    
Environmental measurements 
I sampled plots from May-August 2003.  On each plot, I recorded elevation, transformed 
aspect (Beers et al., 1966), slope gradient, and terrain shape index (McNab, 1989).  
Terrain shape index measures local topographic geometry, and I based measurements on 

 
 
25
eight clinometer sightings every 45o to a change in topographic shape (Abella, 2003).  I 
measured surface rock cover by recording substrate every 0.3 m along a 25-m transect, 
and obtained rock samples later identified by a geologist (Sam Bourque, Ecological 
Restoration Institute, Flagstaff, AZ, USA).  I collected composite soil samples of 0-15 
and 15-50 cm depths from two pits per plot, and examined deeper layers to 150 cm or to 
an impervious layer using a bucket auger.  Soil samples were air dried, sieved through a 
2-mm sieve, and analyzed for CaCO3 equivalent (Goh et al.’s [1993] approximate 
gravimetric method), texture (hydrometer method), pH (1:2 soil:0.01 M CaCl2), and 
organic C and total N (C/N analyzer after HCl removal of inorganic C) following Bartels 
& Bigham (1996) and Dane & Topp (2002).  I also estimated soil available water 
capacity using Saxton et al.’s (1986) equations incorporating texture, gravel content, and 
organic matter (organic C × 1.724).  On three plots each of six ecosystem types, I 
measured gravimetric 0-15 cm soil moisture (24 hr 105oC oven drying) averaged from 
two soil cores each of 208-cm3 per plot.  I made measurements during the driest period of 
the year, when moisture differences may be most critical, on 19 June 2004 after no 
measurable precipitation had fallen since April (Western Regional Climate Center, Reno, 
NV, USA).  Measurement errors averaged < 5% based on a repeated measure every 10 
samples for soil analyses and every six samples for moisture.                
Vegetation measurements 
In 15, 1-m2 subplots per plot centered at 0.5, 5, 12.5, 20, and 24.5 m along plot axes, I 
visually categorized areal percent cover of ground-flora species rooted in subplots as 0.1, 
0.25, 0.5, and 1% up to 1% cover, at 1% intervals to 10% cover, and at 5% intervals 
above 10% cover.  Measurement error, based on remeasuring two randomly selected 

 
 
26
subplots every six plots, averaged < 0.25% for total cover and < 0.25 species m-2.  I 
inventoried species in whole plots on a presence/absence basis, and assigned these 
species a frequency of 1 and the lowest cover for computing importance values (average 
of relative frequency and relative cover summing to 100% on a plot basis).  
Nomenclature follows USDA-NRCS (2004).   
 
To measure tree growth, at 0.4 m above ground level I cored two dominant, open-
grown Pinus ponderosa of pre-settlement origin on each open-canopy plot.  Cores were 
sanded, mounted, and cross-dated using local tree-ring chronologies.  I measured 
diameter increment between ages of 50-150 yr at 0.4 m height to avoid potential 
measurement inaccuracies due to missed piths, while providing a growth measure in the 
early-middle life stage of P. ponderosa (Schubert, 1974).  I used diameter increment as a 
growth measure rather than site index because site index equations have not been 
developed for old-growth, uneven-aged southwestern P. ponderosa stands sampled for 
this study.     
Statistical analysis 
I developed the ecosystem classification by classifying and ordinating the environmental 
matrix using cluster analysis (variables relativized by maximums, Euclidean distance, 
Ward’s linkage method) and principal components analysis (correlation matrix) in PC-
ORD (McCune & Mefford, 1999).  I classified and ordinated the importance value 
vegetation matrix using cluster analysis (Sørensen distance, -0.25 flexible beta linkage) 
and non-metric multidimensional scaling (autopilot, thorough mode).  After identifying 
seven plot groupings in these analyses with 24 remaining plots chiefly of basalt parent 
materials not clearly distinguished, I performed a second iteration of ordination and 

 
 
27
classification separately on these 24 plots.  This analysis identified three plot groupings 
distinguished by soil properties and plant composition.  The final ecosystem classification 
was based on plot groups internally similar in environmental properties and species 
composition, and similarity of classification and ordination results increased the 
classification’s robustness.  I compared means of environmental variables, species 
richness, and Pinus ponderosa diameter increment among classified ecosystems using 
one-way analysis of variance and Fisher’s least significant difference in SAS JMP (SAS 
Institute, 2002).  Raw data approximated assumptions of equal variance (Levene test) and 
normality (Shapiro-Wilk W test).  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Classification 
I classified and named 10 landscape ecosystem types on the basis of diagnostic 
environmental features and characteristic species along a continuum ranging from black 
cinders/Phacelia ecosystems with the driest surface soils and lowest plant cover, to moist 
aspen/Lathyrus and treeless park/Symphyotrichum ecosystems (Table 3.1, Fig. 3.2).  
Other ecosystems differed more subtly, such as xeric basalt/Muhlenbergia ecosystems 
differentiating from mesic basalt/Festuca ecosystems by exhibiting sandier soils, less 
organic C, and more Muhlenbergia montana (Nutt.) A.S. Hitchc. (mountain muhly) than 
Festuca arizonica Vasey (Arizona fescue).  Seven ecosystems corresponded with a 
respective TES type, whereas three ecosystems each occurred on combinations of the 
551, 570, 582, and 585 TES types mostly containing basalt parent material (US Forest 
Service, 1995).  Of six plots sampled in the 582 TES type, for example, I classified four 
into the mesic basalt/Festuca and two into the rocky basalt/Sporobolus ecosystems.  This 

 
 
28
increased internal mean Sørensen similarities of understory vegetation from 44% within 
the 582 TES type to 55% within this study’s mesic basalt/Festuca ecosystem.  Results 
suggest that TES broadly differentiated distinctively different ecosystems, but did not 
detect multivariate interactions among environmental variables distinguishing closely 
related ecosystems (Fig. 3.3).  Similar to eastern US soil surveys, however, TES is a 
starting point for understanding ecosystem distribution on this landscape (Pregitzer et al., 
2001).  By identifying interrelationships, ecosystem classification is useful to refine or 
complement TES in southwestern USA national forests.         
Environmental complexes 
Ecosystems primarily differentiated along soil gradients (Fig. 3.3), reflecting differences 
among soil parent materials from the presence or absence of volcanic activity (Welch & 
Klemmedson, 1975).  Contrasting with ecosystem classification in the eastern USA 
where geomorphology often forms an initial layer distinguishing ecosystems (Hix, 1988; 
Host & Pregitzer, 1992; Abella et al., 2003), ecosystem distribution was not closely 
associated with the geomorphic variables of aspect, slope gradient, or terrain shape index.  
Slope gradients averaged < 8% in all ecosystems except for red cinders/Bahia 
ecosystems, so most plots did not exhibit strong aspects.  Terrain shape indices were near 
zero reflecting fairly linear topography (McNab, 1989), averaging only slightly convex (-
2.1) in red cinders/Bahia ecosystems because of the convex cinder cones this ecosystem 
often occupied.  Park/Symphyotrichum ecosystems had weakly concave (1.9) terrain 
shapes, consistent with this ecosystem’s occurrence in depressions a few meters lower 
than surrounding forested topography.  While geomorphology may influence ecosystem 
composition in rare, localized areas such as particularly deep ravines I did not sample 

 
 
29
(Crawford Zimmerman et al., 1999), the flat to undulating topography on most of the 
landscape minimally affects ecosystem distribution.  
 
Soil properties such as texture and organic C, in contrast to geomorphic variables, 
sharply differed among ecosystems (Table 3.2).  Sand concentration from 0-15 cm in 
black cinders/Phacelia ecosystems exceeded 90% and averaged between 53-63% in red 
cinders/Bahia and limestone ecosystems.  Clay basalt/Gutierrezia, rocky 
basalt/Sporobolus, and park/Symphyotrichum ecosystems exhibited the most 0-50 cm 
clay.  High clay concentrations in park/Symphyotrichum ecosystems combined with the 
flat depressions parks occupy may explain early accounts that some parks seasonally 
were shallow lakes (Kircher, 1910), possibly much moister than they currently are after 
hydrological alterations from livestock tanks (Rusby, 1889).  Siltier textures and higher 
organic C resulting in 0.03-0.05 m3 m-3 greater water-holding capacities (Saxton et al., 
1986) partly distinguished mesic basalt/Festuca ecosystems from other basalt 
ecosystems.  Organic C and total N concentrations also were high in aspen/Lathyrus 
ecosystems, probably reflecting this ecosystem’s high productivity where mean ground-
flora cover was highest (35%).  By occupying large volumes at a given weight, the low-
density cinders in black and red cinder ecosystems (Moore et al., 1976) result in higher 
gravel and lower N and organic C contents volumetrically than on a weight basis (Welch 
& Klemmedson, 1975), decreasing soil fertility in these ecosystems.    
Mean pH ranged from 5.9-7.0 across ecosystems, exceeding 6.5 in xeric 
limestone/Bouteloua, clay basalt/Gutierrezia, and cinder ecosystems (Table 3.2).  The 
mesic limestone/mixed flora ecosystem had among the lowest 0-15 cm pH, and I also did 
not detect appreciable CaCO3 equivalents in this ecosystem.  CaCO3
 equivalent was the 

 
 
30
only soil property not significantly different among ecosystems, with the highest but 
variable amount in the xeric limestone/Bouteloua ecosystem.  While pH does not seem to 
be driven by carbonate equilibria on this landscape, high pH ecosystems apparently are 
associated with parent materials rich in exchangeable bases that also occupy dry sites 
where leaching rates may be slower.     
 
Principal components analysis portrayed correlations among environmental 
variables and their relative importance in structuring the environmental matrix (Fig. 
3.3a), with 40% of variance explained by principal component 1, 20% by component 2, 
and 10% by component 3.  Component loadings were well balanced among 17 important 
environmental variables included in the analysis, consistent with ecosystem classification 
theory that multivariate combinations of environmental variables structure ecosystem 
distribution rather than single-factor gradients (Barnes et al., 1982; Host & Pregitzer, 
1992; Goebel et al., 2001).  Variables exhibiting the highest loadings on component 1 
included 0-15 cm silt (loading = 0.35) and sand (-0.34), UTM easting (-0.29), 0-50 cm 
available water (0.29), 15-50 cm C and N (both 0.27), and 15-50 cm pH (-0.26).  Based 
on three weather stations (Fig. 3.1) and a regional climate study (Jameson, 1969), UTM 
easting probably is partly correlated with a precipitation gradient increasing by ca. 14 cm 
yr-1 from east to west across the study area.  Ecosystems containing soils with low water-
holding capacities also tended to occur in eastern parts of the study area where low 
precipitation may amplify these dry-soil properties (Fig. 3.1).  Dry-season gravimetric 
soil moisture differed by more than a factor of 20 across ecosystems, expressing these 
contrasting environmental complexes (Table 3.2).  Parent material and its influence on 
soil properties, modified regionally by precipitation gradients and locally by rockiness or 

 
 
31
geomorphic gradients, constrained the distribution, productivity, and composition of 
ecosystems on this landscape.  
Species composition and richness 
A total of 271 plant species occurred on the 66 open-canopy plots, with some species like 
Phacelia sericea (Graham) Gray (purplefringe) of black cinders/Phacelia ecosystems and 
Symphyotrichum ascendens (Lindl.) Nesom (western aster) of park/Symphyotrichum 
ecosystems, restricted to one ecosystem type (Table 3.3).  Muhlenbergia minutissima 
(Steud.) Swallen (annual muhly), Nama dichotomum (Ruiz & Pavón) Choisy (wishbone 
fiddleleaf), and other annuals dominated black cinders/Phacelia ecosystems.  These data 
concur with theories that annuals are successful in ecosystems of unpredictable moisture 
(Philippi, 1993), but may also be related to continuous disturbances caused by 
movements of the loose cinders (Fig. 3.2a).  Grazing-resistant Gutierrezia sarothrae 
(Pursh) Britt. & Rusby (broom snakeweed) or Erigeron divergens Torr. & Gray 
(spreading fleabane) dominated clay basalt/Gutierrezia or park/Symphyotrichum 
ecosystems, likely the most heavily grazed ecosystems (Clary, 1975).  Mesic 
limestone/mixed flora ecosystems exhibiting intermediate soil resources (Table 3.2) 
shared species of many ecosystems and had no clear dominant species, seemingly 
consistent with hypotheses that intermediate resource levels promote species coexistence 
(Tilman & Pacala, 1993). 
 
Grass distribution differentiated closely related basalt ecosystems, with C4 
Muhlenbergia montana important in xeric basalt/Muhlenbergia ecosystems and C3 
Festuca arizonica prominent in mesic basalt/Festuca ecosystems (Table 3.3).  These 
distributions, combined with high importance of C4 Bouteloua gracilis (Willd. ex Kunth) 

 
 
32
Lag. ex Griffiths (blue grama) in climatically dry ecosystems, support predictions that C4 
species have greater water-use efficiencies and competitive abilities in dry habitats than 
C3 species (Wentworth 1983).  Rocky basalt/Sporobolus ecosystems were distinguished 
by high importance of Sporobolus interruptus Vasey (black dropseed), Lathyrus 
laetivirens Greene ex Rydb. (aspen peavine), and Pedicularis centranthera Gray (dwarf 
lousewort).  Legumes including Lupinus argenteus Pursh (silver lupine), Vicia americana 
Muhl. Ex Willd. (American purple vetch), and Lathyrus lanszwertii var. leucanthus 
(Rydb.) Dorn (Nevada vetchling) predominated in aspen/Lathyrus ecosystems.  It is 
possible these legumes contributed to high soil N levels in this ecosystem (Crews, 1999).  
Park/Symphyotrichum ecosystems also contained several moist-affinity species including 
Iris missouriensis Nutt. (Rocky Mountain iris) and Allium geyeri S. Wats. (Geyer’s 
onion) uncommon elsewhere. 
Limestone ecosystems contained the most species per 500-m2 plot, and richness 
per plot also averaged > 38 species in rocky basalt/Sporobolus, clay basalt/Gutierrezia, 
and red cinders/Bahia ecosystems (Fig. 3.4a).  Black cinders/Phacelia and 
aspen/Lathyrus ecosystems, occupying extremes of productivity and soil-resource 
gradients, had the fewest species per plot. Aspen/Lathyrus ecosystems, however, 
exhibited high richness per 1-m2 subplot, reflecting high species densities at fine grains in 
this ecosystem but rapid leveling off of species richness with increasing grain (Fig. 3.4b).  
Ecosystem distribution predicted spatial variation in species composition and richness on 
this landscape reasonably well, presumably because the ecosystem framework integrated 
factors constraining composition and richness (Lapin & Barnes, 1995).  
Pinus ponderosa growth 

 
 
33
The oldest tree was dated to 1646 and all trees in the data set were of presettlement 
origin, recording growth rates in presttlement forests.  Mean Pinus ponderosa diameter 
growth differed by nearly a factor of two across ecosystems (Fig. 3.5).  The slowest 
growth occurred in red cinders/Bahia ecosystems, whereas the fastest growth occurred in 
aspen/Lathyrus ecosystems containing mixed P. ponderosa-Populus tremuloides forests.  
Growth rates also tended to be 0.7-0.8 mm yr-1 higher in mesic basalt than in rocky or 
xeric basalt ecosystems, probably reflecting the mesic basalt’s greater rooting volume 
because of fewer rocks and more available water.  While black cinders/Phacelia 
ecosystems contained inhospitable surface soils, variable but on average rapid diameter 
growth occurred once a tree established.  This paradox may result because of minimal 
ground-flora competition, deep subsoils (> 1.5 m) consisting of alternating cinder-soil 
layers retaining subsoil moisture, or loose soils facilitating development of extensive, 
branched root systems (Haasis, 1921).  Colton (1932) also noted rapid diameter growth 
near Sunset Crater in the study area, and Lindsey (1951) found that the greatest mean 
increment of 3.4 mm yr-1 among central New Mexico soils he studied occurred on 
volcanic cinder soils.   
 
Previous research in southwestern Pinus ponderosa forests has been conflicting 
on whether P. ponderosa growth differs among land classification units (Meurisse et al., 
1975; Stansfield et al., 1991).  Mathiasen et al. (1987), for example, found that site index 
did not differ among seven vegetation-based habitat types in Colorado, New Mexico, and 
northern Arizona. Verbyla and Fisher (1989) also concluded that habitat types did not 
reliably predict P. ponderosa site index in southern Utah because of wide environmental 
variation within habitat types.  Meurisse et al. (1975), however, reported site indices 

 
 
34
ranging from 17-26 m (base age 100 yr) that differed significantly among 12 northern 
Arizona soil series.  My findings combined with those of Lindsey (1951) and Meurisse et 
al. (1975) suggest that land classifications such as ecosystem classification are useful for 
predicting P. ponderosa growth since these classifications incorporate environmental 
variables affecting growth (Cox et al., 1960).  
Classification in dense stands 
A possible criticism of this ecosystem classification is that it was developed in open 
presettlement-origin stands, whereas most of the landscape contains dense postsettlement 
stands typically exceeding 1000 trees ha-1, exhibiting low ground-flora cover, and often 
requiring the most intensive restoration (Abella & Covington, 2004).  Species 
composition differentiated by ecosystem type even more strongly in dense than in open 
stands, and ecosystems in dense stands also differentiated along rock cover, texture, and 
other gradients like in open stands (Fig. 3.6).  Mesic limestone/mixed flora ecosystems in 
dense stands had sandy soil textures and no clear dominant species similar to their open 
counterparts, while grass distribution and environmental gradients distinguished basalt 
ecosystems.  Ecosystem specificity of plant composition may have intensified in dense 
stands because only high-fidelity species persisted below dense canopies, precluding 
more widespread and opportunistic species able to occupy open stands.  
Implications for ecological restoration 
Reference conditions 
Determining reference conditions is a major goal in restoration ecology, with reference 
conditions for Arizona Pinus ponderosa forests usually considered to be ca. 1875 
(European settlement) since this is the most recent time these forests are thought to have 

 
 
35
been free of degrading factors such as fire exclusion (Moore et al., 1999).  Three lines of 
evidence suggest that ecosystems similar to those classified in this study occurred on this 
landscape at the time of settlement: (1) abiotic variables such as soil texture forming 
backbones of ecosystems are considered relatively stable landscape features (Palik et al., 
2000), (2) major differences in tree growth occurred among sites in prestttlement forests 
(Fig. 1.5), and (3) historical reports and photos provide geographic-specific accounts of 
occurrences of ecosystems like parks and sites exhibiting different soil texture and rock 
cover (Rusby, 1889; Leiberg et al., 1904; Kircher, 1910).  An important point is that 
while grazing and other factors may have altered species composition of some 
ecosystems since settlement (Hanson, 1924), these are similar ecosystem types but with 
different species composition.  A given ecosystem type may contain multiple species 
compositions during different time periods (e.g., Archambault et al., 1989; Goebel et al., 
2001; Abella et al., 2003).  This is consistent with a guiding premise of ecosystem 
classification that vegetation comprises only one, and usually the least stable, of three 
basic landscape ecosystem components of geomorphology, soils, and vegetation (Barnes 
et al., 1982).   
 
Reference conditions for herbaceous vegetation are not well known in Pinus 
ponderosa forests similar to many ecosystems (Moore et al., 1999), hampering efforts to 
define and restore target communities (Bakker et al., 2000).  Although historical accounts 
suggest that most native species presently on this landscape occurred in presettlement 
forests, these accounts provide little information about species distributions and also 
unfortunately occurred after initiation of heavy livestock grazing (Vasey, 1888; Britton, 
1889).  While herbarium records and other reconstructive methods (e.g., Kerns et al., 

 
 
36
2003) may provide additional clues to past composition, this study’s information on 
contemporary ecosystems is one of the few currently available references on species-soil 
relationships.  Although imperfect like other reference information and best used in 
combination with other data sources, contemporary ecosystems are an important source 
of reference information (White & Walker, 1997; Palik et al., 2000).   
Current distributions among ecosystems for some species, for example, probably 
places approximate bounds on where these species occurred in presettlement forests 
(Table 3.3).  In contrast to Muhlenbergia montana, for instance, Festuca arizonica is 
absent from dry ecosystems such as red cinders/Bahia ecosystems and likely did not 
occur in those ecosystems in presettlement forests because F. arizonica has a C3 pathway 
poorly adapted to xeric sites (Sage & Monson, 1999).  If a land manager has limited 
funds to purchase seeds for revegetating a rocky, loamy basalt site burned by wildfire, for 
example, revegetating the site with native species of the rocky basalt/Sporobolus 
ecosystem seems more accurate than using general species mixes that may or may not 
have grown on rocky basalt sites.  Furthermore, experiments with current ecosystems 
such as reintroducing fire and comparing responses of different ecosystems may enhance 
our understanding of past composition of the diverse ecosystems on this landscape. 
Prioritization and scale 
Ecological restoration in the study area has largely been prioritized near the city of 
Flagstaff in the wildland-urban interface, which is prudent since recent wildfires in Pinus 
ponderosa forests have threatened settlements (Allen et al., 2002).  This approach may 
not well prioritize other ecosystems farther from settlements, however, that also require 
restoration (Palik et al., 2000).  Red cinders/Bahia ecosystems, for example, historically 

 
 
37
were rare based on their soils distribution, occupying < 1840 ha or < 1.7% of the study 
area (US Forest Service, 1995).  About 9/32 (28%) of this ecosystem’s mapping units (> 
30% of its area) also have been burned by crown fires since 1950, suggesting that red 
cinders/Bahia ecosystems are the most endangered landscape ecosystems in the study 
area.  Priority could be given to restoring this ecosystem’s remaining mapping units to 
forestall further losses by crown fires.  
 
Ecosystem turnover occurs over broad extents on this landscape, with mapping 
units sometimes exceeding 1000 ha (US Forest Service, 1995), differing from ecosystem 
classifications in many eastern US forests where ecosystem turnover is spatially rapid 
(Lapin & Barnes, 1995; Goebel et al., 1999; McNab et al., 1999).  Broad-extent turnover 
indicates that restoring dispersed mapping units of different ecosystems or large areas 
will be required to encompass ecosystem diversity in restoration on this landscape.  Sizes 
of restoration units needed to encompass multiple ecosystem types, for instance, could be 
conceptualized as an ecosystem-area curve.  Since financial and other resources often are 
limited for conducting restoration, estimating optimal sizes and distributions of 
restoration units for maximizing cumulative ecosystem diversity included in restoration is 
an important topic for future research.   
CONCLUSION 
Ecosystem distribution on this landscape followed the distribution of soil properties and 
parent materials, modified by regional precipitation gradients and locally by variables 
such as rock cover and geomorphology.  An important area of future research is 
examining rare ecosystems such as springs or deep ravines (Crawford Zimmerman et al., 
1999) I did not sample, which may be keystone ecosystems requiring special restoration 

 
 
38
(Stohlgren et al., 1997).  It is important to recognize that vegetation is one of the more 
transient and easily changed ecosystem components, whereas properties such as soil 
parent material are fixed for long time periods.  This persistence suggests that the same 
basic ecosystems presently on this landscape occurred at the time of settlement.  Multiple 
classifications, such as vegetation or stand condition classes, in combination with 
ecosystem classification likely will provide the most comprehensive site information 
database to guide restoration.  A given ecosystem type may contain constituent sites 
widely differing in current conditions, with mesic basalt/Festuca ecosystems, for 
example, currently containing sites burned by crown fire or showing indications of 
overgrazing.  Relatively intact sites within ecosystems, however, exhibited high degrees 
of similarity, suggesting that reference conditions within ecosystem types may be similar.  
This study provides an initial ecosystem framework for ecological restoration on this 
landscape that can be improved by future research measuring past species composition, 
fire regime, and stand structure reference conditions among ecosystems, estimating 
ecosystem-specific differences between reference and current conditions, identifying 
target communities for restoration, and replicating restoration experiments across 
ecosystem types to measure ecosystem-specific responses.

VEGETATION-ENVIRONMENT RELATIONSHIPS AND ECOLOGICAL 
SPECIES GROUPS OF AN ARIZONA PINUS PONDEROSA LANDSCAPE, USA 
 
Key words: Ecosystem classification, Forest, Geomorphology, Ground flora, Understory, 
Soil  
Abstract 
I developed ecological species groups, consisting of co-occurring plant species exhibiting 
similar environmental affinities, on a 110,000-ha Pinus ponderosa landscape in northern 
Arizona, USA to provide data on vegetation-environment relationships and species 
distributions.  I measured geomorphology, soils, and vegetation on 66, 0.05-ha plots, and 
classified 52 of the 271 detected plant species into 18 ecological species groups.  Species 
groups ranged from Phacelia and Bahia groups occupying xeric, volcanic cinder soils 
low in organic C and total N, to Festuca and Lathyrus groups characterizing moist, loam-
silt loam soils.  Upper 0-15 cm soil total N, for example, averaged only 0.09% on 12 
plots where a Bahia group exhibited its highest importance, compared to 0.19% on 12 
plots where a Festuca group was most important.  Using discriminant analysis, I also 
built a model that correctly classified the most important of four grasses (Bouteloua 
gracilis, Muhlenbergia montana, Sporobolus interruptus, or Festuca arizonica) on 70-
80% of plots based on five environmental variables related to soil moisture and resource 
levels.  I applied this study’s data in a regression tree model using abundances of key 
plant species to estimate diameter increment of old-growth P. ponderosa.  The most rapid 

 
 
63
P. ponderosa diameter growth averaging 4.9 mm/yr occurred on plots with high 
importance of Lupinus argenteus and F. arizonica.  Soil parent material, affected by the 
presence or absence of volcanic activity, seems a primary factor constraining vegetation 
patterns on this landscape.  My results on this semi-arid landscape support several general 
ecological species group principles chiefly developed in temperate regions, and suggest 
that vegetation-environment research has great potential for enhancing our understanding 
of P. ponderosa forests occupying vast areas of the southwestern United States. 
Introduction 
Ecological species groups consist of co-occurring plant species sharing similar 
environmental affinities (Spies and Barnes 1985; Godart et al. 1989; Grabherr et al. 
2003).  Species groups are based on the theory that evolutionary and community 
processes such as competition confine species to environmental complexes where they 
are best adapted (Host and Pregitzer 1992; Kashian et al. 2003).  Species group research 
identifies environmental gradients correlated with species distributions, classifies species 
assemblages occupying similar environmental complexes, and relates species 
distributions to management-oriented variables such as tree growth (Bergeron and 
Bouchard 1984; Hix 1988; Host and Pregitzer 1991).  Based on the principle that 
vegetation expresses environmental site conditions, once species groups are developed 
for an area their distribution can be used to rapidly estimate soil properties and other 
variables relatively difficult to measure (Pregitzer and Barnes 1982; Meilleur et al. 1992). 
In North America, species groups have been most frequently developed for 
temperate ecosystems, including Michigan hardwood forests (Archambault et al. 1989; 
Simpson et al. 1990; Host and Pregitzer 1991) and Georgia Coastal Plain Pinus palustris 

 
 
64
(longleaf pine) savannas (Goebel et al. 2001).  Kashian et al. (2003), for example, 
classified eight species groups comprised of 31 species occurring along soil texture and 
drainage gradients on a Michigan Pinus banksiana (jack pine) landscape.  Presence of a 
Fragaria group indicated soils containing fine-textured bands where P. banksiana height 
growth was rapid, whereas a Rubus group indicated sandy sites with slow P. banksiana 
growth.  On a southern Appalachian landscape, soil solums averaged 120 cm thick when 
a Sanguinaria group typified by Sanguinaria canadensis (bloodroot) was abundant, 
compared to only 61 cm thick when this group was sparse (Abella and Shelburne 2004).  
Species-rich, productive sites were associated with thick soil solums, which could be 
readily identified without making soil measurements by observing the distribution of the 
Sanguinaria group.  These studies illustrate that species groups have been useful on 
contrasting landscapes, and among-landscape differences can be expected in 
environmental variables affecting moisture, nutrients, and other factors constraining 
species distributions. 
Occupying more than 3.4 million hectares in Arizona and New Mexico alone, 
southwestern United States Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa pine) forests inhabit a diversity 
of landscapes differing in topography and soil parent material (Brown 1994).  This large 
environmental variation and few published soil-plant community data suggest that 
species group research may be useful in P. ponderosa forests.  Ecosystem integrity has 
declined in these forests since European settlement (ca. 1875) from several factors, 
including exclusion of historically frequent surface fires, increasing density of small-
diameter trees, and heavy livestock grazing (Covington et al. 1994; Allen et al. 2002).  
Ecological restoration, chiefly tree thinning and prescribed burning, is ongoing in P. 

 
 
65
ponderosa forests to return ecosystem structure and function to within a range of 
variability thought to characterize presettlement forests (Fulé et al. 1997).  I undertook 
this study to determine environmental gradients most strongly correlated with plant 
distributions by developing ecological species groups on a 110,000-ha Arizona P. 
ponderosa landscape to improve our understanding of the P. ponderosa landscapes we 
are trying to restore.  I illustrate an application of these data by predicting diameter 
increments of old-growth P. ponderosa based on relative abundances of key plant 
species.                      
Methods 
Study area 
This study was performed at elevations between 1920-2660 m in northern Arizona, USA 
on the north half of the Coconino National Forest and on the Northern Arizona University 
Centennial Forest (Fig. 4.1).  Based on Jameson’s (1969) regional climate study and three 
weather stations each with > 35 years of records, precipitation increases and temperatures 
decrease from east to west across the study area.  Mean total precipitation ranges from 
42-56 cm/yr, snowfall from 152-233 cm/yr, and maximum mean daily temperatures from 
15.7-17.5 oC (Western Regional Climate Center, Reno, NV).  Slope gradients are less 
than 10% on most of the landscape, occasionally greater in deep ravines and on cinder 
cones.  Volcanic activity has affected soil properties in many parts of the study area, with 
the most recent volcanic eruptions occurring ca. 900 years ago near Sunset Crater in the 
northeastern part of the study area (Moore et al. 1976).  Major soil subgroups include 
Typic and Udic Argiborolls, Typic and Mollic Eutroboralfs, Typic Ustorthents, and 
Vitrandic Ustochrepts (U.S. Forest Service 1995).  Forests are primarily pure Pinus 

 
 
66
ponderosa, but P. ponderosa occurs with Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen) or 
Quercus gambelii (Gambel oak) in some stands.   
Site selection and ecosystem classification 
I used a terrestrial ecosystem survey (TES) soil map (U.S. Forest Service 1995) of the 
study area to randomly select six mapping units for sampling in each of 11 TES types 
(55, 500, 513, 523, 536, 551, 558, 570, 582, 585, and 611) covering a range of soil types.  
TES classifies soils to families and provides information similar to county soil surveys 
common in the eastern United States (U.S. Forest Service 1995).  I sampled one 20 x 25 
m (0.05 ha) plot in each mapping unit (n = 66 plots) in areas exhibiting open canopies, 
relatively intact understories, and no visual indications of major recent disturbance.  
Areas dominated by old-growth trees most frequently met these criteria (Kerns et al. 
2003).  I did not sample springs, deep ravines, or other rare ecosystems (Crawford 
Zimmerman et al. 1999), as my focus was on widespread landscape ecosystems 
occupying > 95% of the study area.   
Ecological species groups often are developed in conjunction with ecosystem 
classification because species distributions can then be interpreted among environmental 
gradients treated as continuums or compared among ecosystem types (e.g., Goebel et al. 
2001).  I classified the 66 plots into 10 ecosystem types (Fig. 4.1) internally similar in 
environmental and vegetational characteristics described in detail in Abella (2005) using 
methods similar to Abella et al. (2003).  I named ecosystems based on diagnostic plant 
species and environmental features such as soil parent material.  Ecosystems ranged from 
sandy-textured black cinders/Phacelia ecosystems containing dry volcanic cinder soils 
and low plant cover, to silt loam mesic basalt/Festuca ecosystems with high cover of 

 
 
67
Festuca arizonica (Arizona fescue), Carex geophila (White Mountain sedge), and 
Lupinus argenteus (silvery lupine).  Other ecosystems included treeless 
park/Symphyotrichum ecosystems occupying depressions often with clay loam soils, and 
aspen/Lathyrus ecosystems containing mixed Pinus ponderosa-Populus tremuloides 
(trembling aspen) forests with loamy soils high in total N and plant cover.             
Field and laboratory procedures  
I sampled ground flora in 15, 1-m2 subplots centered at 0.5, 5, 12.5, 20, and 24.5 m along 
the bottom, middle, and top axes of each of the 66 plots.  I visually categorized percent 
cover of each species rooted in each subplot as 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1% up to 1% cover, at 
1% intervals to 10% cover, and at 5% intervals above 10% cover.  Measurement error 
averaged < 2% for total cover and < 0.5 species/m2 based on remeasuring two randomly 
selected subplots every six plots.  I recorded species in whole plots on a presence/absence 
basis, and assigned these species a frequency of 1 and the lowest cover value for 
computing importance values.  I calculated importance values on a plot basis for each 
species as the average of relative frequency and relative cover (summing to 100% for 
each plot).  Sampling occurred from May-August 2003.  Nomenclature follows USDA-
NRCS (2004).   
Geomorphic variables I collected on each plot included slope gradient, 
transformed aspect (Beers et al. 1966), and terrain shape index that measures local 
topographic shape (McNab 1989).  I measured rock cover every 0.3 m on a 25-m transect 
by recording the percentage of rock intercepts out of 83 points.  I collected composite soil 
samples from 0-15 and 15-50 cm layers by digging a 50-cm deep pit at the northwest and 
southeast corners of each plot.   

 
 
68
Soil samples were air dried, sieved through a 2-mm sieve, and analyzed for CaCO3 
equivalent (Goh et al.’s [1993] approximate gravimetric method), texture (hydrometer 
method), pH (1:2 soil:0.01 M CaCl2), and organic C and total N (C/N analyzer after HCl 
removal of inorganic C) following Bartels and Bigham (1996) and Dane and Topp 
(2002).  Analysis of duplicate samples every 10 samples indicated that analytical error 
averaged < 5%.  I estimated soil available water capacity for each plot from texture, 
gravel, and organic matter (organic C × 1.724) using Saxton et al.’s (1986) equations 
available online (http://hydrolab.arsusda.gov/soilwater/Index.htm).   
I measured Pinus ponderosa diameter growth on all plots except for six treeless 
plots in park/Symphyotrichum ecosystems by coring two trees per plot at 40 cm above 
ground level.  I selected trees for coring that were open-grown dominants of 
presettlement origin.  Old-growth P. ponderosa can be readily identified by their bark 
color that turns from black to yellow-orange after ca. age 100 yr (Schubert 1974).  Cores 
were mounted, sanded, and cross-dated using local tree-ring chronologies (Fulé et al. 
1997).  I used age 50-150 yr increment averaged on a plot basis as a growth measure for 
the early-middle life stage of P. ponderosa (Schubert 1974).           
Statistical analyses 
To identify environmental variables most strongly correlated with plant community 
composition, I ordinated the vegetation importance value matrix with environmental 
vectors using non-metric multidimensional scaling (autopilot, thorough mode) in PC-
ORD (McCune and Mefford 1999).  I used discriminant analysis (SAS Institute 1999) to 
model distributions of four major grasses based on environmental variables.  I employed 
stepwise selection to identify variables for inclusion in the model, and I also manually 

 
 
69
entered combinations of variables (Tabachnick and Fidell 1996).  Five of the six variables 
identified in stepwise selection provided high discriminatory power for as few variables 
as possible.  I used equal prior probabilities, and employed cross-validation (jackknifing) 
for examining model robustness (SAS Institute 1999). 
I developed ecological species groups in an R-mode analysis (McCune and Grace 
2002) including hierarchical cluster analysis (Sørensen distance and -0.25 Flexible Beta 
group linkage method) and non-metric multidimensional scaling in PC-ORD (McCune 
and Mefford 1999).  I relativized importance values for these analyses by species sums of 
squares to emphasize habitat preferences, avoiding groupings based on the commonness 
or rarity of species (McCune et al. 2000).  Species groups identified in non-metric 
multidimensional scaling were similar to those identified in cluster analysis, and I also 
examined raw data to refine groupings portrayed by these multivariate analyses (Kashian 
et al. 2003).  I included 52 species in species groups, representing common species whose 
distributions could be assessed based on available data.  While species groups identified 
in these analyses are a logical classification of species displaying similar environmental 
affinities, this classification is one of a few reasonable groupings (Kashian et al. 2003; 
Abella and Shelburne 2004).  I used a regression tree model (Breiman et al. 1984) in S-
PLUS software (Insightful Corporation 2001) to estimate Pinus ponderosa diameter 
increment based on importance values of plant species.  Regression trees partition 
independent variables similar to a dichotomous botanical key, and provide point 
estimates for dependent variables corresponding to different levels of independent 
variables (McCune and Grace 2002).  I input 15 major species to the regression 
algorithm, which retained four species in the final model.

Results and discussion 
Community-environment gradients 
Plant community composition was correlated with moisture-affecting soil physical 
properties such as texture, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) easting probably partly 
reflecting a precipitation gradient (Jameson 1969; Fig. 4.1), and soil-resource gradients 
such as total N (Fig. 4.2).  Variables most strongly correlated (Pearson r2 > 0.2) with axis 
1 or 2 of the community ordination included 0-15 cm sand, 0-50 cm available water 
capacity, 15-50 cm silt, 0-15 cm organic C, 15-50 cm total N, UTM easting, and 15-50 
cm pH.  Festuca arizonica and Lupinus argenteus increased in community importance 
with increasing soil available-water capacity, and silt, organic C, and total N 
concentrations.  Bahia dissecta (ragleaf bahia), in contrast, increased with increasing sand 
and decreasing available water, organic C, and total N. 
Species composition was not strongly correlated (r2 < 0.08) with the geomorphic 
variables of slope gradient, aspect, and terrain shape index.  Gently sloping ravines and 
drainages on this landscape are common, but these topographic features apparently need 
to be especially large or steep before they appreciably affect vegetation patterns 
(Crawford Zimmerman et al. 1999).  Soil parent material rather than geomorphology 
primarily structures vegetation patterns at broad extents on this landscape (Fig. 4.2).  
Parent material on this landscape largely depends on the presence or absence of volcanic 
activity and the age and type of volcanic material (Welch and Klemmedson 1975; Moore 
et al. 1976).   
Modeling species distributions 

 
 
71
Grasses had the highest average importance among plant lifeform functional groups in all 
10 classified ecosystem types, and I modeled which one of four dominant grasses would 
have the highest importance value at different levels of five environmental variables 
using discriminant analysis (Table 4.1).  The model correctly classified the most 
important grass on 80% of plots in resubstitution and 70% in cross-validation.  Consistent 
with ordination results (Fig. 4.2), Festuca arizonica was most important on plots with 
high soil available-water capacity.  Bouteloua gracilis (blue grama), however, dominated 
plots with lower water-holding capacities, higher pH (> 6.5), and also tended to occur in 
clay basalt/Gutierrezia, xeric limestone/Bouteloua, and cinder ecosystems where 
precipitation is sparse (Fig. 4.1).  Sporobolus interruptus (black dropseed) occupied 
clayey sites and was largely restricted to plots of the rocky basalt/Sporobolus ecosystem 
exhibiting high surface rock cover (> 10%) usually occurring in the study area’s south 
half.  Muhlenbergia montana was important on a range of plots, but importance of this 
species declined while importance of F. arizonica increased in loam-silt loam mesic 
basalt/Festuca and aspen/Lathyrus ecosystems.  These distributional differences could be 
related to photosynthetic pathways, with the C4 M. montana more competitive on drier 
sites than the C3 F. arizonica (Sage and Monson 1999).  
Plots misclassified by the model mostly occurred where two species had nearly 
equal importance values.  Misclassifications occurred for dry plots where Bouteloua 
gracilis and Muhlenbergia montana were co-dominant, and on plots of the mesic 
limestone/mixed flora ecosystem where Festuca arizonica and M. montana were co-
dominant (Table 4.1).  Nevertheless, this model’s reasonably good accuracy suggests that 
development of quantitative species-environment models has potential for increasing our 

 
 
72
understanding and predictive ability of plant distributions at plot scales on southwestern 
Pinus ponderosa landscapes. 
Similar to grasses, many forbs occupied characteristic environmental complexes, 
illustrated for six species along soil texture and fertility gradients (Fig. 4.3).  Bahia 
dissecta, for example, dominated plots sandier and lower in total N than Lupinus 
argenteus.  Occupying a fairly narrow range of site conditions, Pedicularis centranthera 
(dwarf lousewort) occurred on plots containing 0.05-0.1% total N and 20-40% 15-50 cm 
sand.  Penstemon linarioides (toadflax penstemon) occurrences were not soil-texture 
specific, but 0-15 cm pH exceeded 6.5 on 89% (8/9) of this species’ occurrences.  
Antennaria parvifolia (small-leaf pussytoes) and Vicia americana (American vetch) 
exhibited similar distributions, occupying loam and silt loam sites of lower pH than P. 
linarioides.  These data suggest that observing abundances of groups of species can 
facilitate rapid field assessments of environmental site conditions such as texture and soil 
N on this landscape. 
Ecological species groups    
I classified 18 ecological species groups comprised of 52 plant species, with groups 
differentiating along soil texture and other gradients (Fig. 4.4, Table 4.2).  The Phacelia 
group, for example, consisting of Phacelia serrata (saw phacelia), Penstemon clutei 
(Sunset Crater beardtongue), and Physaria newberryi (Newberry’s twinpod), was 
restricted to plots in black cinders/Phacelia ecosystems containing the driest surface soils 
in the study area.  Upper 0-15 cm sand concentration averaged 92%, 15-50 cm organic C 
only 0.2%, and 15-50 cm total N only 0.02% in the three plots where the Phacelia group 
occurred.  Similarly, Erysimum capitatum (sanddune wallflower) and Hymenoxys 

 
 
73
subintegra (Arizona rubberweed) comprising the Erysimum group were restricted to red 
cinders/Bahia ecosystems, and also indicated sandy sites low in organic C and total N.  In 
contrast, the Festuca group, composed of Festuca arizonica, Lupinus argenteus, and 
Carex geophila, indicated moist, loam-silt loam productive soils rich in C and N.  On 13 
plots where total importance of the Festuca group exceeded 30% (range = 30-51%), 0-15 
cm silt averaged 52%, 15-50 cm organic C 1.5%, and 15-50 cm total N 0.13%.  Although 
overlapping in distribution, the Muhlenbergia group typified by Muhlenbergia montana 
indicated sandier textures and lower soil-resource levels than the Festuca group.  Upper 
0-15 cm silt concentration averaged 19% lower, and 15-50 cm organic C and total N were 
half as concentrated on the 13 plots where the Muhlenbergia group was most important 
(importance values = 26-43%) compared to the 13 plots where the Festuca group was 
most important.   
In a vegetation classification of central and northern Arizona, Hanks et al. (1983) 
also noted that Festuca arizonica occupied moister sites than Muhlenbergia montana 
which occurred over a broader range of dry-moist sites.  Korstian (1917) similarly 
reported that F. arizonica was most abundant on moist sites in west central New Mexico 
Pinus ponderosa forests.  My results also agree with Hanson’s (1924) finding in the study 
area that Bouteloua gracilis and Bahia dissecta were dominants on dry cinder soils.  
Lindsey (1951), however, reported that B. dissecta and F. arizonica both occupied cinder 
benches consisting of volcanic ash on a New Mexico P. ponderosa landscape, whereas 
these species exhibited little distributional overlap in my study (Table 2).  Merkle (1962) 
found that Arenaria fendleri (sandwort) was among the most important forbs in two park 
grasslands near the Grand Canyon north of my study area, consistent with my finding that 

 
 
74
this species in the Symphyotrichum group characterized park/Symphyotrichum 
ecosystems.  Species group research in other regions has noted the importance of among-
landscape differences in species distributions (Pregitzer and Barnes 1982; Host and 
Pregitzer 1991), important to clarify for P. ponderosa regions in future research.             
My results on this semi-arid landscape support several general species group 
principles chiefly developed on temperate landscapes (e.g., Spies and Barnes 1985; 
Grabherr et al. 2003; Kashian et al. 2003).  For example, authors in eastern USA forests 
have concluded that while some species groups are restricted to only one ecosystem type, 
most groups occur in several ecosystems but are quantitatively most important in only a 
few (Archambault et al. 1989; Abella and Shelburne 2004).  My results concur with this 
principle because only a few groups such as the Phacelia and Erysimum groups were 
restricted to one ecosystem type, and quantitative distributional differences were 
important for distinguishing closely related groups like the Festuca and Muhlenbergia 
groups (Table 4.2).  Species groups also typically are reported to more strongly indicate 
environmental complexes rather than single-factor gradients (Spies and Barnes 1985; 
Archambault et al. 1989; Meilleur et al. 1992), which also concurs with my results.  
While a soil texture gradient corresponded with the Bahia group’s distribution, for 
example, many groups could not be differentiated along individual gradients.  The 
Hymenopappus group, for instance, occurred on a range of soil textures illustrated by 
Penstemon linarioides’s distribution (Fig. 4.3).  High importance of this group, however, 
was indicative of dry soils, often of the xeric limestone/Bouteloua or clay 
basalt/Gutierrezia ecosystems resulting from combinations of clayey or sandy textures, 
low precipitation, and low-moderate organic C concentrations.   

 
 
75
Scale and factors resulting in different environmental complexes are key 
differences between my study and previous species group research in temperate eastern 
USA forests.  Spatially rapid turnover in species composition has been reported for some 
eastern forests, with dominance of species groups shifting at extents < 100 m for instance 
in southern Appalachian forests (Abella and Shelburne 2004).  Plant community and 
species group turnover occurs at broader extents on this landscape, where soil mapping 
units containing similar plant communities exceeding 1000 ha are not uncommon (U.S. 
Forest Service 1995).  These scale differences likely occur because environmental factors 
constraining species distributions change at broader scales on this landscape.  For 
example, soil drainage and depth to water table changed over short distances and directed 
species distributions on several eastern USA landscapes (Archambault et al. 1989; 
Goebel et al. 2001).  These variables were not closely associated with species 
distributions in my study (Welch and Klemmedson 1975).  These comparisons illustrate 
that past events, such as glaciation in Michigan (Host and Pregitzer 1992) or volcanic 
activity on this landscape (Moore et al. 1976), differ among landscapes yet similarly 
create environmental complexes affecting species distributions.                                  
Estimating tree growth 
I applied this study’s data by predicting diameter growth of open-grown, old-growth 
Pinus ponderosa based on importance values of four plant species in a regression tree 
model (Fig. 4.5).  The model’s terminal nodes represent predicted P. ponderosa annual 
diameter increments (Insightful Corporation 2001).  For example, the most rapid 
diameter growth of 4.9 mm/yr is predicted if importance of Lupinus argenteus exceeds 
8% and importance of Festuca arizonica exceeds 17%.  Low importance of these species 

 
 
76
and greater importance of Sporobolus interruptus indicates slower diameter growth, 
probably because S. interruptus indicates rocky sites where tree rooting may be restricted 
(Table 2).  Plots where none of these species were important exhibited the slowest 
diameter growth of 2.6 mm/yr, with these plots often dominated by Bouteloua gracilis in 
climatically dry areas where sparse precipitation combined with soils holding little 
available water may limit P. ponderosa growth.  Daubenmire (1961) and Stansfield et al. 
(1991) also found that plant species predicted tree growth fairly reliably in P. ponderosa 
forests.  Vegetation-environment research has potential for increasing our understanding 
of P. ponderosa forest ecology, providing a foundation for ecological restoration and 
management in these forests.

SEED BANKS OF AN ARIZONA PINUS PONDEROSA LANDSCAPE: 
RESPONSES TO ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS AND FIRE CUES 
 
Abstract:  We measured soil seed banks of 102 plots on a 110 000-ha Arizona Pinus 
ponderosa landscape, and determined seed bank responses to fire cues and tree density, 
compared seed bank composition among ecosystem types, and assessed the utility of seed 
banks for ecological restoration.  Liquid smoke increased community-level seed bank 
emergence in greenhouse experiments, whereas 100oC heating had minimal effect and P. 
ponderosa charred wood decreased emergence.  We detected 103 total species in seed 
bank samples, and 280 species in aboveground vegetation.  Erigeron divergens was the 
most frequent seed bank species, and with the exception of Gnaphalium exilifolium, 
species detected in seed banks also occurred aboveground.  Although a dry, sandy-
textured black cinders ecosystem exhibited the greatest seed density, seed bank 
composition was more ecosystem-specific than was seed density.  Major graminoids 
including Carex geophila and Muhlenbergia montana were common in seed banks, 
whereas perennial forbs were sparse particularly in areas of high tree density.  Our results 
suggest that smoke may increase emergence from seed banks in these forests, seed banks 
can assist establishment of major graminoids but not forbs during ecological restoration, 
and ecosystem-specific seed bank composition occurs to a certain extent across the 
landscape.

Introduction 
 
Soil seed banks consist of stored, viable seeds that can emerge when germination 
requirements are met, which for some species occurs after canopy-reducing disturbance 
or after fire (Thompson 1987; Halpern et al. 1999; Odion and Davis 2000).  In frequent-
fire ecosystems, fire-related cues such as smoke, heat, ash, or charred wood may 
stimulate germination of some species that otherwise exhibit low germination (Baldwin 
et al. 1994; Dixon et al. 1995; Blank and Young 1998).  Burne et al. (2003), for example, 
found that two Grevillea shrub species in Australian heath ecosystems germinated only 
on plots sprayed with liquid smoke, while Roche et al. (1997) reported that aerosol smoke 
sharply increased germination from 5 to 246 seeds/m2 in seed banks of Australian 
Eucalyptus forests.  In California chaparral, Keeley et al. (1985) found that germination 
of about half of 30 tested species responded positively to heating or to additions of 
Adenostoma fasciculatum (chamise) charred wood, with responses to these cues 
consistent with the post-fire distribution of these species.  These studies suggest that seed 
bank exposure to fire cues can affect post-fire community succession in frequent-fire 
ecosystems, and may influence our impression of seed bank composition in greenhouse 
emergence studies.   
 
Surface fire historically was prevalent in western United States Pinus ponderosa 
(ponderosa pine) ecosystems, and reintroducing fire along with tree thinning is 
increasingly proposed for ecological restoration of these forests (Fulé et al. 1997; Allen et 

 
 
97
al. 2002).  Tree density has increased and understory vegetation has declined in these 
forests during a post-settlement period of fire exclusion beginning in the late 1800s 
(Covington et al. 1994).  Previous seed bank research in P. ponderosa forests has been 
limited and conflicting, ranging from estimates of 8 seeds/m2 on a northern Arizona site 
(Vose and White 1987) to more than 13 000 seeds/m2 on an Oregon site (Pratt et al. 
1984).  Predicting seed bank characteristics of P. ponderosa forests is further complicated 
since these forests share attributes of many ecosystems, by being coniferous forests that 
usually have small seed banks (Roberts 1981), often shrub- or grass-dominated 
ecosystems that may have large or small seed banks (Warr et al. 1993), and in dry regions 
frequently surrounded by deserts that have large seed banks (Guo et al. 1998).  Fire-seed 
bank relationships also have been little studied in these forests, despite fire’s historical 
prevalence and potentially extensive reintroduction during restoration, making it difficult 
to foretell potential seed bank contributions to community dynamics during ecological 
restoration.   
 
We examined composition and responses to fire cues of soil seed banks of a 
northern Arizona Pinus ponderosa landscape proposed to receive extensive restoration 
treatments.  Since this landscape contains a range of soil and ecosystem types that may 
undergo restoration, we also focused on landscape-scale variation in seed bank 
characteristics across environmental gradients.  Our specific objectives were to: (1) 
determine seed bank responses to the fire cues of heat, charred wood, and smoke using 
greenhouse experiments, (2) compare seed bank characteristics among environmental 
gradients and regional landscape ecosystems, and (3) assess the potential role of seed 
banks for the restoration of forest understories.

Methods 
Study area 
 
We collected seed bank samples between 1920-2660 m elevations on a 110 000-
ha landscape surrounding the city of Flagstaff, Arizona in the Northern Arizona 
University Centennial Forest and the north half of the Coconino National Forest (study 
area SE corner 35o01'N, 111o23'W; SW corner 35o04'N, 111o53'W; NW corner 35o29'N, 
111o51'W; NE corner 35o23'N, 111o31'W).  Based on three weather stations, total 
precipitation across the study area ranges from 42-56 cm/yr, snowfall from 152-233 
cm/yr, and maximum mean daily temperatures from 15.7-17.5oC (Western Regional 
Climate Center, Reno, NV).  Soil parent materials include volcanic cinders, basalt, 
benmoreite, and limestone, with major soil subgroups including Typic and Udic 
Argiborolls, Typic and Mollic Eutroboralfs, Typic Ustorthents, and Vitrandic Ustochrepts 
(U.S. Forest Service 1995).  Slope gradients are <10% over most of the study area, and 
cinder cones, ravines, and low hills punctuate this undulating topography.  Before fire 
exclusion beginning in the late 1800s, return intervals for primarily lightning ignited 
surface fires averaged <10 yr (Fulé et al. 1997).  Livestock grazing has been widespread 
since the late 1800s, and grazing by Cervus elaphus (Rocky Mountain elk) and other 
ungulates also occurs (Clary 1975).  Tree species include Pinus ponderosa which forms 
extensive pure stands, Quercus gambelii (Gambel oak), and less commonly Populus 
tremuloides (trembling aspen), Pinus edulis (two-needle pinyon), and Juniperus spp.  
Understories are dominated by graminoids including Festuca arizonica (Arizona fescue), 
Muhlenbergia montana (mountain muhly), Carex geophila (White Mountain sedge), 
Bouteloua gracilis (blue grama), and Elymus elymoides (squirreltail).

Field procedures and ecosystem classification 
 
We sampled 66, 0.05-ha (20 × 25 m) plots by sampling one plot in each of six 
randomly selected mapping units of 11 soil types (numbered 55, 500, 513, 523, 536, 551, 
558, 570, 582, 585, and 611) mapped in a Terrestrial Ecosystem Survey (TES) of the 
study area (U.S. Forest Service 1995).  These 66 plots are termed ecosystem plots in this 
paper and were classified into ecosystem types based on multivariate analyses of 
environment and vegetation characteristics using methods described in Abella (2005) 
similar to Abella et al. (2003).  We identified 10 ecosystem types, ranging from a dry, 
coarse-textured black cinders ecosystem, to moist, nitrogen-rich aspen and treeless park 
ecosystems (Table 5.1).  Four primarily basalt ecosystems differentiated from each other 
along soil texture and rockiness gradients, and xeric and mesic limestone ecosystems of 
similar texture differentiated along a regional precipitation gradient (Western Regional 
Climate Center, Reno, NV).  Park ecosystems occupied depressions ranging in size from 
2 to >1000 ha, receive exceptionally heavy grazing (Clary 1975), and were dominated by 
Erigeron divergens (spreading fleabane), Muhlenbergia wrightii (spike muhly), and 
Symphyotrichum ascendens (western aster).  Ecosystem plots were located below open 
canopies, which usually occurred around old-growth trees (White et al. 1991).  An 
additional 36 plots, 18 in open areas and 18 under dense canopies (Pinus ponderosa 
density >1000 trees/ha), were sampled in the 536, 570, and 585 TES types.   
 
We measured seed banks, soils, geomorphology, and aboveground vegetation on 
all 102 plots.  Using a 4.2-cm diameter cylinder, we collected seed bank samples of 70 
cm3 from 0-5 and 5-10 mineral soil depths in each of 15, 1-m2 subplots per plot, resulting 
in a composite plot sample of 1050 cm3 for each depth.  Subplots were located at 0.5, 5, 

 
 
100
12.5, 20, and 24.5 m along the south, center, and north plot axes.  Although litter can trap 
seeds (e.g., Halpern et al. 1999), we focused on mineral soil seed banks because our 
open-canopy plots contained patchy, sparse litter layers.  Sampling occurred from mid-
May to August 2003, and seed bank collections likely primarily represent the persistent 
seed bank (Baskin and Baskin 2001) since sampling occurred before most species had 
dispersed seeds.  We also categorized areal cover of each plant species rooted in subplots, 
inventoried all species in whole plots on a presence/absence basis, and recorded Oi-
horizon thickness, slope gradient, aspect, and elevation of each plot.  Composite soil 
samples of 0-15 and 15-50 cm depths were collected from two pits per plot, air dried and 
sieved through a 2-mm sieve, and analyzed for CaCO3 equivalent (Goh et al.’s [1993] 
approximate gravimetric method), texture (hydrometer method), pH (1:2 soil:0.01 M 
CaCl2), and organic C and total N (C/N analyzer after HCl removal of inorganic C) 
following Bartels and Bigham (1996) and Dane and Topp (2002).  We also estimated soil 
available water capacity from texture, gravel content, and organic matter (organic C × 
1.724) using Saxton et al.’s (1986) equations available online 
(http://hydrolab.arsusda.gov/soilwater/Index.htm).   
General seed bank procedures 
 
Using the emergence method (Warr et al. 1993), we performed an initial summer 
seed bank compositional study on untreated 0-5 and 5-10 cm samples started in the 
greenhouse the same day each sample was collected and provided a mid-May 2003 to 
January 2004 germination period, and five subsequent experiments on 0-5 cm samples 
stored at -5oC for 4-6 months after collection.  We performed experimental treatments in 
January 2004, and gave experimental samples a January-October 2004 germination 

 
 
101
period.  Square plastic pots of 700 cm3 served as experimental units.  We filled these pots 
with 120 cm3 of seed bank soil 1 cm thick overlaying 300 cm3 of sterile potting soil 
(United Industries Co., St. Louis, MO).  Pots were randomly arranged on benches in a 
Northern Arizona University greenhouse maintained at 24oC, given four hours (6:00-8:00 
am and pm) of daily artificial lighting except for May-August, watered daily, and 
monitored for emergence every two weeks.  We randomly interspersed 24 pots 
containing only potting soil to check for seed contamination.  Conyza canadensis 
(Canadian horseweed) was a contaminant in the summer study, so we deleted this species 
from the summer data.  Nomenclature and native/exotic species classifications followed 
USDA-NRCS (2004).   
Known-seed and seed bank experiments 
Concurrently with seed bank experiments, we performed a known-seed 
experiment testing heat and smoke effects on emergence of locally collected seeds stored 
at -5oC for four months of six species common in northern Arizona Pinus ponderosa 
forests.  Our purpose was to determine if emergence requirements were met for these 
species, addressing a criticism of the seed bank emergence method (Warr et al. 1993).  
This experiment was a three-factor, split-plot factorial design consisting of two levels of 
the whole plot factor heat (none, exposure to 100oC for 30 minutes), two levels of the 
subplot factor liquid smoke (none, 60 ml of 10% smoke), and six levels of species 
(Elymus elymoides, Festuca arizonica, Geranium caespitosum [pineywoods geranium], 
Lupinus argenteus [silvery lupine], Penstemon barbatus [beardlip penstemon], or 
Thalictrum fendleri [Fendler's meadow-rue]). Three replicate pots were used for each of 
the 24 treatment combinations, and seeds were lightly pressed in four rows of four seeds 

 
 
102
in each pot (16 seeds/pot) on 120 cm3 of locally collected basalt soil overlaying 300 cm3 
of potting soil.   
 
Experiment 1 of the seed bank experiments tested heat, liquid smoke, and 
ecosystem type effects on emergence density and species richness in a factorial, three-
factor experiment using samples from 33 randomly selected ecosystem plots.  Each of 
four samples per plot received either no treatment, a 100oC 30 minute heat exposure, 60 
ml of 10% liquid smoke by volume, or heat + smoke (33 plots × 4 pots each = 132 total 
pots).  We heated pots containing potting and seed bank soil in an electric oven, and 
prepared liquid smoke solutions by diluting commercially available liquid smoke 
(Wright’s Brand, Roseland, NJ) with deionized water.  Previous research has found that 
air smoke and different kinds of liquid smoke exhibit similar effects on germination (van 
Staden et al. 2000).  Experiment 2 was a two-factor experiment using the remaining 33 
ecosystem plots testing ecosystem types and treatments, which included a 50oC 30 
minute heat exposure, addition of 30 ml of Pinus ponderosa charred wood intermixed 
with the seed bank soil, 100oC 30 minute heating + charred wood, and 100oC 30 minute 
heating + charred wood + 10% liquid smoke (33 plots × 4 pots each = 132 total pots).  
We prepared charred wood (blackened with no visible bark remaining) by burning P. 
ponderosa logs and grinding burned pieces to pass a 4-mm sieve.    
Experiment 3 was a two-factor experiment testing canopy types (open or dense) 
and treatments, consisting of a single or double (30 days after initial application) 100oC 
30 minute heat exposure, or a single or double addition of 60 ml of 10% liquid smoke.  
We used nine plots for each canopy type in this experiment (18 plots × 4 pots each = 72 
total pots).  Experiments 4 and 5 each included nine dense-canopy plots, with Experiment 

 
 
103
4 including the same treatments as Experiment 1 and Experiment 5 including the same 
treatments as Experiment 2 (9 plots × 4 pots each = 36 total pots for each experiment).  
Statistical analyses   
We analyzed the known-seed experiment using analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
with 60-day percent emergence as the response variable.  Raw data approximated equal 
variance (Levene test) and normality (Shapiro-Wilk W test) assumptions.  After square 
root transforming emergence density and species richness to meet assumptions, we also 
used ANOVA to analyze experimental seed bank data.  In all seed bank experiments, we 
defined plots as a random blocking variable because four seed bank samples per plot 
were extracted for treatment from composite plot samples.  We compared mean square-
root transformed emergence density among ecosystem types using one-way ANOVA.  
We performed analyses with SAS JMP (SAS Institute 2002) and used Tukey’s test for 
multiple comparisons.  Seed bank data are known for their variability (Baskin and Baskin 
2001), so we also highlight trends not statistically significant at P < 0.05 but potentially 
ecologically insightful.  We also ordinated summer study seed bank composition 
(emergent seeds/m2 relativized by plot totals) and aboveground vegetation importance 
values (average of relative frequency and relative cover summing to 100% on a plot 
basis) using non-metric multidimensional scaling (autopilot, thorough mode) in PC-ORD 
(McCune and Mefford 1999).       
Results and Discussion 
Summer compositional study 
 
We identified 53 species in 0-5 cm, 44 species in 5-10 cm, and 66 species overall 
in 0-10 cm untreated samples from the 102 plots.  Erigeron divergens was the most 

 
 
104
frequent species with a 35% 0-10 cm frequency, followed by Verbascum thapsus 
(common mullein) with a 25% frequency (Table 5.2).  Seven other species exhibited 0-10 
cm frequencies ≥  10%, including Gnaphalium exilifolium (slender cudweed), Carex 
geophila, Chamaesyce serpyllifolia (thymeleaf sandmat), Muhlenbergia minutissima 
(annual muhly), Erigeron flagellaris (trailing fleabane), Poa pratensis (Kentucky 
bluegrass), and an unidentified forb.  Of the 29 most common species, 14% were exotics, 
27% were grasses, none were shrubs or trees, 34% were perennials, 10% were biennials, 
41% were annuals, and 14% were short-lived annuals-perennials.  Although 87% of 
species were more frequent in 0-5 cm than in 5-10 cm samples, most species occurred at 
both depths.  
 
Four dominant aboveground graminoids, including Carex geophila, Festuca 
arizonica, Muhlenbergia montana, and Poa fendleriana (muttongrass), exhibited seed 
bank frequencies ≥  2%, while fewer dominant aboveground forbs were frequent seed 
bank species.  While little correspondence between seed bank and aboveground 
composition has been widely reported for forests (Roberts 1981), our findings indicate 
that if a species was detected in the seed bank it almost always also occurred 
aboveground.  For example, E. divergens occurred aboveground on 34/36 (94%) plots in 
which it was detected in the seed bank, greater than the 67% expected by chance from its 
aboveground frequency.  Poa pratensis occurred aboveground on all 10 plots in which it 
was detected in the seed bank, M. montana on all nine plots, and Coreopsis tinctoria 
(golden tickseed) on all three plots.  Gnaphalium exilifolium was an exception, detected 
in 13% of seed bank samples but absent aboveground.  Elymus elymoides was the most 
prevalent aboveground species that was sparse in seed banks, occurring aboveground in 

 
 
105
97% of plots but in only 1% of seed bank samples.  The exceptionally high seed viability 
of this species with no special germination requirements apparently renders a seed bank 
unnecessary for its success (Young and Evans 1977).  Furthermore, E. elymoides would 
not be predicted to form a persistent mineral soil seed bank (Thompson et al. 1993) 
because the species has heavy, awned seeds, that are 2-3 mg heavier than the smooth 
seeds of other grasses such as P. fendleriana and M. montana common in seed banks.       
Known-seed experiment 
 
In the known-seed experiment testing heat and liquid smoke effects for assessing 
emergence requirements, Elymus elymoides exhibited 88-90% emergence across 
treatments (Table 5.3), consistent with McDonough (1970) who reported high 
germination of E. elymoides seeds collected in Utah.  Festuca arizonica emergence also 
was high across treatments, ranging from 67-79%.  The forbs Geranium caespitosum, 
Lupinus argenteus, and Thalictrum fendleri had lower emergence than the grasses, and 
did not significantly respond to smoke or to 100oC heating.  Emergence of L. argenteus 
was 37-56% lower than the 79% emergence of Wyoming seeds under alternating 15-25oC 
temperatures reported by Romme et al. (1995).  Thalictrum fendleri’s low emergence of 
13-29%, however, is consistent with Hoffman’s (1985) results for Colorado seeds.  
Penstemon barbatus did respond strongly to smoke, with smoke increasing emergence by 
44% over the 19% control emergence.  This may represent an evolutionary response 
(Baskin and Baskin 2001) to frequent fires long characteristic of Pinus ponderosa forests 
in which P. barbatus is common.  Keeley and Fotheringham (1998) found that air smoke 
increased germination of Penstemon centranthifolius (scarlet bugler) by 30% in 
California chaparral, suggesting that responses to smoke in southwestern United States 

 
 
106
Penstemon may not be uncommon.  Results of this experiment suggest that greenhouse 
emergence requirements at least of these tested species would likely be met if their seeds 
occurred in seed bank samples. 
Seed bank experiments 
 
Treatment means in Experiment 1 ranged from 1237-1591 seeds/m2 and 1.6-2.1 
spp/120 cm3.  While not statistically significant at P < 0.05, greater emergence and 
species richness occurred after liquid smoke additions (Fig. 5.1, Table 5.4).  Ecosystem 
type was not significant and did not interact with heat or liquid smoke.  Treatment was 
significant in Experiment 2, with emergence after Pinus ponderosa charred wood 
additions averaging 391 seeds/m2 less than the 1200 seeds/m2 emerging when charred 
wood was applied with 100oC heating + liquid smoke (Fig. 5.1).  Reduced emergence 
after charred wood addition contrasts with the California chaparral results of Keeley et al. 
(1985), who found that Adenostoma fasciculatum charred wood significantly increased 
germination of six of 12 annuals tested while reducing only one species, increased two of 
six Phacelia species, and did not affect four herbaceous perennials.  Our findings agree 
with those of Lodhi and Killingbeck (1982), however, who found that P. ponderosa 
needles and materials were allelopathic and reduced germination of Andropogon gerardii 
(big bluestem) and Schizachyrium scoparium (little bluestem) in North Dakota P. 
ponderosa forests.  While charred wood of species other than P. ponderosa may have 
enhanced emergence in our experiment, P. ponderosa is a major or sole source of woody 
material across most of the study area.              
 
Treatment and canopy type both were significant at P < 0.10 in Experiment 3 
(Table 5.4), with multiple heat or smoke applications increasing emergence only for 

 
 
107
open-canopy plots (Fig. 5.2).  Similar to Experiment 1 (Fig. 5.1), smoke caused greater 
emergence than heat for both canopy types, with overall means of 1308 seeds/m2 and 2.3 
spp/120 cm3 for smoked samples compared to 775 seeds/m2 and 1.3 spp/120 cm3 for 
heated samples.  While heat-stimulated species such as Ceanothus fendleri (Fendler's 
ceanothus) occur in Pinus ponderosa forests (Huffman 2003), our results suggest that 
smoke promotes community-level seed bank emergence more strongly than heat, at least 
at the levels of smoke and heat tested in this study.  Smoke also induced greater 
emergence than heat in seed banks of an Australian Eucalyptus forest (Read et al. 2000). 
Canopy type also was a fairly strong main effect in Experiment 3, with overall 
means of 625 seeds/m2 and 1.2 spp/120 cm3 for dense-canopy plots, and 1458 seeds/m2 
and 2.4 spp/120 cm3 for open-canopy plots (Fig. 5.2).  Sparse mineral soil seed banks 
below dense canopies could result from minimal seed inputs because of depauperate 
aboveground vegetation (Harper 1977), reduced seed viability by burial below possibly 
allelopathic Pinus ponderosa litter (Lodhi and Killingbeck 1982), or appreciable numbers 
of seeds not detected in the mineral soil samples could have been trapped in Oi horizons 
(Strickler and Edgerton 1976), which averaged 3.5 cm thick in dense-canopy plots 
compared to only 2.0 cm in open-canopy plots.  Consistent with our results, Springer 
(1999) detected 16 species in 0-5 cm seed banks of open plots in P. ponderosa forests 
near the Grand Canyon, compared to only seven species in dense-canopy plots.   
 
Smoke more than doubled emergence and species richness of seed banks from 
dense-canopy plots in Experiment 4, but differences were not significant because of high 
within-treatment variability (Fig. 5.3).  Similar to Experiment 2 with open-canopy plots 
(Fig. 5.1), charred wood decreased emergence in dense-canopy samples of Experiment 5 

 
 
108
(Fig. 5.4).  Emergence after exposure to charred wood averaged only 278 seeds/m2, 787 
seeds fewer than a 50oC heat treatment and at least 324 seeds fewer than any other 
treatment.  Heat and smoke apparently partially counteracted charred wood’s negative 
effects, because greater emergence occurred when heat or smoke was applied with 
charred wood than when charred wood was applied alone. 
 
We detected 78 total species in the experimental samples, including 37 species 
not detected in the summer study.  Most of these new species occurred in fewer than 
three samples each, making it difficult to ascertain if these species occurred simply 
because of the additional samples, the cold storage period, or the treatments.  For 
example, the only occurrences of Ceanothus fendleri, previously identified as a heat-
stimulated species (Huffman 2003), were in two samples receiving 100oC heat in 
Experiment 2.  Nicotiana attenuata (coyote tobacco), previously shown to germinate 
most strongly after smoke exposure (Baldwin et al. 1994), emerged from only one sample 
which received liquid smoke in Experiment 1.  Other new species detected during the 
experiments included Pinus ponderosa, the exotic Linaria dalmatica (Dalmatian 
toadflax), and the perennial forbs Heliomeris multiflora (showy goldeneye), Hymenoxys 
bigelovii (Bigelow's rubberweed), Lotus wrightii (Wright's deervetch), Oenothera flava 
ssp. taraxacoides (yellow evening-primrose), Oxytropis lambertii (purple locoweed), 
Potentilla plattensis (Platte River cinquefoil), and Thlaspi montanum (alpine pennycress).  
Common species in the summer study, such as Erigeron divergens, Verbascum thapsus, 
Nama dichotomum (wishbone fiddleleaf), and Poa fendleriana, also were the most 
common overall in the experiments.      

 
 
109
 
In summarizing these experiments, (a) liquid smoke increased community-level 
emergence and species richness, (b) heat had minimal effects and did not interact with 
smoke, (c) Pinus ponderosa charred wood when added alone reduced emergence, (d) 
ecosystem type did not interact with treatments, (e) open-canopy plots had much greater 
seed density and species richness than closed-canopy plots, and (f) pinpointing individual 
species that increased or decreased emergence as a result of these factors is difficult 
because many species were sparse.  Studying seeds of known species or seed banks 
expected to contain certain species could help identify species-specific responses (e.g., 
Ralphs and Cronin 1987; Clark and Wilson 1994).      
Comparisons among ecosystems and environmental gradients 
 
Mean 0-5 cm seed density in the summer study ranged from 417 seeds/m2 in the 
xeric limestone ecosystem to 3333 seeds/m2 in the park ecosystem, whereas for unclear 
reasons, the park ecosystem exhibited the lowest seed density after cold storage averaged 
across the experiments (Fig. 5.5).  The xeric, gravelly black cinders ecosystem exhibited 
the third highest seed density in the summer study and the highest overall density by 
more than 600 seeds/m2 in the experiments, driven by high abundance of the annuals 
Nama dichotomum, Chenopodium graveolens (fetid goosefoot), and Muhlenbergia 
minutissima.  High variability within ecosystems, however, precluded the statistical 
significance of any seed-density differences among ecosystems.  Measured soil and 
topographic variables also were not strongly correlated with seed density, with Pearson 
correlations (r), for example, of -0.23 with pH, 0.15 with % gravel, 0.10 with total N, 
0.28 with % clay, and -0.10 with available soil water.    

 
 
110
 
Seed bank composition more strongly differentiated along ecosystem and 
environmental gradients than did seed density, but less strongly than aboveground 
vegetation (Fig. 5.6).  Seed bank compositional patterns are more pronounced if similar 
ecosystems are grouped, by combining, for example, the black and red cinder 
ecosystems.  While not restricted to the cinder ecosystems, Nama dichotomum and 
Muhlenbergia minutissima, for instance, attained their highest abundance in these sandy 
ecosystems.  Sand content of the upper 15 cm averaged 70% in the 21 plots in which N. 
dichotomum was detected in seed bank samples, but only 37% in the 45 plots in which 
this species was not detected.  Park and clay basalt ecosystems, both exhibiting the most 
0-15 cm clay (Table 5.1) and receiving heavy grazing (Clary 1975), contained the only 
seed bank occurrences of Coreopsis tinctoria, Gutierrezia sarothrae (broom snakeweed), 
and Oenothera flava ssp. taraxacoides, and the highest abundance of Erigeron divergens.  
Poa pratensis was most prominent in the mesic, N-rich aspen ecosystem, while seven of 
the 11 (64%) plots in which Carex geophila was detected in the seed bank were from the 
aspen or mesic basalt ecosystems.  Seed bank distribution of these species followed 
environmental gradients affecting the distribution of their aboveground vegetation.  Other 
species, such as Verbascum thapsus and Gnaphalium exilifolium, exhibited little apparent 
association with specific ecosystems or environmental gradients, with their seed 
deposition likely more closely associated with past disturbances than with environmental 
gradients.            
Regional comparisons  
 
Our overall summer study average of 1600 seeds/m2 (0-5 cm) is sharply greater 
than previous findings of 186 seeds/m2 (litter + 0-3 cm soil) in a South Dakota Pinus 

 
 
111
ponderosa stand (Wienk et al. 2004), and 8-22 seeds/m2 (Vose and White 1987) and 25-
600 seeds/m2 (Korb et al. 2004) for the 0-5 cm depth at sites near Flagstaff encompassed 
by our investigation’s study area.  Our overall 0-10 cm average of 2500 seeds/m2, 
however, is much lower than estimates of 13 000-14 000 seeds/m2 (litter + 0-10 cm 
depth) by Pratt et al. (1984) in a Washington P. ponderosa stand, which these authors 
explained may not be typical of area forests because of exceptional numbers of exotic 
species and proximity to other community types.  Springer’s (1999) results of 1200 
seeds/m2 (0-5 cm) for P. ponderosa-Quercus gambelii forests near the Grand Canyon at 
Mt. Trumbull 190 km north of our study area most closely correspond to our results.  Our 
detection of 103 total species in seed bank samples is much greater than detection in 
previous studies in P. ponderosa forests, which ranged from three (Vose and White 1987) 
to 57 species (Pratt et al. 1984).  Elevated species detection in our study could result from 
our large number of sample sites and ecosystem types, the experimental treatments, or 
other factors. 
 
Eighteen of 38 (47%) species detected by Springer (1999) in seed banks at Mt. 
Trumbull also were detected in our study, including the major species Erigeron 
divergens, Chamaesyce serpyllifolia, Poa pratensis, Verbascum thapsus, Nama 
dichotomum, Muhlenbergia minutissima, and Verbena bracteata (bigbract verbena).  
Probably reflecting differences in regional species pools, Artemisia tridentata (big 
sagebrush), Collinsia parviflora (maiden blue-eyed Mary), Leonurus cardiaca (common 
motherwort), Viola canadensis (Canadian white violet), and Chenopodium berlandieri 
(pitseed goosefoot) were abundant at Mt. Trumbull but were not detected in our study.  
We detected <10% of the species Pratt et al. (1984) detected, with congruent species 

 
 
112
mainly including exotics such as Verbascum thapsus, Bromus tectorum, and P. pratensis 
that Springer (1999) also detected.  These observations suggest that some species may be 
fairly widespread in seed banks throughout P. ponderosa forests, but substantial regional 
differences in seed bank composition can be expected in this widespread forest type.          
Implications for ecological restoration 
 
Seed banks are useful in ecological restoration if desired species occur in the seed 
bank and conditions promoting their germination can be created (van der Valk and 
Pederson 1989).  Since we identified 280 aboveground species on plots and 103 species 
in seed bank samples, many species of the study area do not form persistent seed banks, 
were too infrequent in seed bank samples to be detected, or have germination 
requirements we did not meet (Warr et al. 1993).  Species notably common aboveground 
with >40% plot frequencies but absent from seed bank samples included Astragalus 
humistratus (groundcover milkvetch), Cirsium wheeleri (Wheeler's thistle), Polygonum 
douglasii (Douglas' knotweed), Pseudocymopterus montanus (alpine false springparsley), 
and Vicia americana (American vetch).  The four perennial forbs in our known-seed 
experiment (Table 5.3) also were absent from seed bank samples.  With some exceptions 
such as Cohen et al.’s (2004) study in a North Carolina Pinus palustris (longleaf pine) 
forest, our study concurs with previous studies reporting few perennial forbs in forest 
seed banks (Warr et al. 1993).  Because many perennial forbs also disperse seeds only 
short distances (Ehrlén and van Groenendael 1998), our study supports observations that 
colonization by perennial forbs can be expected to be slow after thinning and burning 
during Pinus ponderosa forest restoration, particularly in dense stands containing few 
aboveground seed sources (Vose and White 1987; Abella 2004).

In contrast to the paucity of perennial forbs, many dominant, native graminoids 
such as Muhlenbergia montana and Carex geophila were detected in seed banks of both 
open- and dense-canopy plots.  This may explain why these graminoids often initially 
increase fairly rapidly after thinning and burning (Abella and Covington 2004).  Short-
lived, native forbs also were fairly common in our seed bank samples, suggesting that 
perennial forbs are likely the most seed-limited functional group in these forests 
(Turnbull et al. 2000).  Given increasing concern about exotic species invasions in Pinus 
ponderosa forests, attention could be given to establishing desirable, perennial forbs 
more rapidly than may occur from natural colonization during restoration (Bakker et al. 
1996).  Seeding and outplanting have shown some success in P. ponderosa forests (Steed 
and DeWald 2003; Springer and Laughlin 2004), but have not been extensively tested to 
date.  Enhancing on-site seed production and germination possibly through timely 
burning or grazing reductions (White et al. 1991; Kinucan and Smeins 1992) also may 
assist recovery of perennial forbs during restoration.  Our study suggests that during 
restoration in northern Arizona P. ponderosa forests, seed banks can facilitate 
establishment of major native graminoids, supply seeds of short-lived native forbs but 
also of some exotic species, and may exhibit enhanced emergence after prescribed fire 
although timing of fires may be important.

FOREST-FLOOR TREATMENTS IN ARIZONA PONDEROSA PINE 
RESTORATION ECOSYSTEMS: NO SHORT-TERM EFFECTS ON PLANT 
COMMUNITIES 
 
ABSTRACT.––Leaf litter has accumulated during fire exclusion and tree density increases 
in post-settlement southwestern Pinus ponderosa forests, and may limit the establishment 
and emergence of understory vegetation that has recovered slowly during forest 
restoration.  I performed an experiment in northern Arizona P. ponderosa forests to 
ascertain community responses to forest-floor scarification and Oi removal on 36, 100-m2 
plots overlaid on an existing thinning and burning restoration experiment.  Contrasting 
with findings from many other forest types, forest-floor treatments had no effect on 
community diversity or composition during the 2-yr experiment, with post-treatment 
Sørensen similarities as high as 97% within treatments and no indication from 
successional vectors of possible longer term effects.  An absence of response to these 
fairly drastic treatments is surprising given these forests’ exceptionally heavy Oi horizons 
and large proportions of conifer litter.  Based on sparse A-horizon seed banks averaging 
< 300 seeds/m2 and paltry aboveground vegetation, I hypothesize that seed shortages 
particularly for native perennials partly precluded a treatment response.  Since extensive 
unvegetated areas at these restoration sites could be colonized by exotics, a conservative 
management strategy is to test seeding or outplanting of desirable native species to fill 
unoccupied sites.  It is important to report “no treatment effect” experiments such as this 

 
 
139
one to avoid biasing meta-analyses, and for future research to clarify combinations of 
factors limiting understory communities to identify treatments that may more rapidly 
promote recovery of native species during ecosystem restoration in this region.                     
 
Key words: leaf litter, O horizon, soil, ground flora, seed bank, seed limitation, species 
diversity. 
INTRODUCTION 
Leaf litter directly and indirectly influences understory vegetation in plant 
communities.  Decomposition of litter can immobilize some nutrients while releasing 
others, and produce allelopathic chemicals (Klemmedson et al. 1985).  Accumulated litter 
intercepts light, affects soil microclimates, and can trap seeds or form physical barriers to 
plant emergence (Facelli and Pickett 1991).  Litter also can be a filter in some plant 
communities regulating fine-grain species richness and species distributions by affecting 
plant germination and establishment (Sydes and Grime 1981).  In a New York deciduous 
forest, for example, Beatty and Sholes (1988) found that removal of thick litter layers 
from treefall pits caused pit species composition to converge with that of treefall mounds, 
and all forbs colonizing litter-removed pits had previously been restricted to mounds.    
 
In experiments in a variety of ecosystems, litter addition has often decreased 
germination, establishment, and species richness (Monk and Grabrielson 1985, Horman 
and Anderson 2003), whereas litter removal has resulted in increases at least in the short 
term for some species (Goldberg and Werner 1983, Vellend et al. 2000).  Carson and 
Peterson (1990), for example, found that litter removal from 1-m2 plots in New Jersey old 
fields increased plant density within 45 days, with Oxalis stricta  (common yellow oxalis) 

 
 
140
increasing by 530 plants/m2.  Plant community responses to litter manipulations may vary 
with community type, the composition and quantity of litter, species pools and propagule 
availability, resource levels, and other factors (Xiong and Nilsson 1999).    
 
After fire exclusion and increases in tree density since the late 1800s, many 
contemporary southwestern United States Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa pine) forests 
contain large amounts of litter from P. ponderosa needles, cones, bark, and wood 
(Covington and Sackett 1984).  O horizons comprising forest floors, which include 
recognizable litter (Oi horizon) and decomposed duff (Oe+a horizon), were > 5 cm thick 
and weighed > 3000 g/m2 in dense northern Arizona P. ponderosa stands surpassing 
1500 trees/ha (Wollum and Schubert 1975, Klemmedson 1976, Fulé and Covington 
1994).  These depths and weights equal or exceed those of many world forests (Bray and 
Gorham 1964, Vogt et al. 1986), suggesting that litter may particularly affect or limit 
plant communities in contemporary P. ponderosa forests.                
I performed an experiment in northern Arizona Pinus ponderosa forests to test the 
hypotheses that removing litter and scarifying the forest-floor increases plant species 
richness and diversity, changes community composition, and differentially affects 
individual species.  By overlaying this experiment on an existing ecological restoration 
experiment that included tree thinning and prescribed burning, I sought to measure 
whether forest-floor manipulations could promote native plant establishment which has 
often been slow in this region after thinning and burning (Abella 2004).   
METHODS 
Study Area 

 
 
141
 
I performed this experiment in the 1200-ha Fort Valley Experimental Forest 
(35°16'N, 111°43'W) in the Coconino National Forest, 15 km northwest of the city of 
Flagstaff in northern Arizona.  Elevation is ca. 2300 m, and soils are primarily basalt-
derived and classified as Mollic Eutroboralfs and Typic Argiborolls (USDA Forest 
Service 1995).  Annual precipitation averages about 55 cm and half falls as snow 
(Western Regional Climate Center, Reno, NV).  Forests are pure Pinus ponderosa, with 
graminoids dominating understory communities including Carex geophila (White 
Mountain sedge), Elymus elymoides (squirreltail), Festuca arizonica (Arizona fescue), 
Muhlenbergia montana (mountain muhly), and Poa fendleriana (muttongrass).  
Presettlement (pre 1875) tree densities averaged about 60 trees/ha, and fires primarily 
from lightning ignitions occurred on average at least once every 10 years (Covington et 
al. 1997).  Likely from a combination of livestock grazing, fire exclusion, and increased 
tree density, ground flora declined after settlement, persisting only below canopy gaps or 
as isolated occurrences on litter-choked forest floors below dense canopies (Vose and 
White 1991).   
 
This experiment was overlaid on 9 sites of an existing ecological restoration 
experiment initiated in 1998-1999 with goals of approximately reestablishing 
presettlement stand structure, reducing fuels, and increasing understory vegetation (Fulé 
et al. 2001a).  These 9 sites in the restoration experiment included three 14-ha sites for 
each of 3 restoration prescriptions: control (no thinning, no burning), medium restoration 
(3-6 thin prescription + prescribed burning), and intensive restoration (2-4 thin 
prescription + prescribed burning).  Thinning prescriptions represent ratios at which 
evidence (stumps, snags, and fallen logs) of presettlement tree locations were replaced by 

 
 
142
postsettlement trees retained during thinning.  The 2-4 prescription most sharply reduced 
tree densities, and Fulé et al. (2001a) describe prescriptions in more detail.  Restoration 
prescriptions served as blocks in the current experiment to more accurately compare 
responses to forest-floor treatments, because forest-floor and vegetation characteristics 
differed among prescriptions prior to this experiment (Table 6.1). 
Experimental Design and Treatments 
 
I randomly located four 10 m × 10 m (0.01 ha) plots at each site for a total of 36 
plots (n = 9 for each treatment), with plots at a site separated by 3 m and arranged in a 2 
× 2 square.  One of 4 forest-floor treatments was randomly assigned to each plot at each 
site in a factorial design consisting of 2 levels of scarification (none, O horizon scarified) 
and 2 levels of Oi horizon removal (none, Oi removed).  Scarification was performed to 
possibly bring seeds to the soil surface while creating a variegated establishment surface 
for dispersed seeds (Chambers 2000).  Oi horizons were removed to expose mineral soil 
for a seed bed, while eliminating thick litter layers that possibly form a barrier to 
emergence from soil seed banks (Horman and Anderson 2003).  I performed scarification 
treatments by hand by dragging a 45-cm wide metal rake across plots to break up O 
horizons and the upper few cm of mineral soil.  I removed Oi horizons by raking litter off 
plots using a 75-cm wide plastic rake, with removals per plot ranging from 290-2200 kg 
oven-dry weight.  Oe+a horizons were thin or absent except in control restoration 
prescriptions that had not been thinned or burned, and I retained these horizons on plots 
during Oi removal.  Observations during treatment application indicated that no apparent 
damage occurred to existing vegetation during treatments since treatments were applied 

 
 
143
by hand and rakes moved over existing vegetation.  I performed treatments in April 2003, 
and I raked Oi removal plots again in April 2004 to remove litterfall.   
Vegetation and Environmental Sampling 
I sampled ground flora on plots in April 2003 before treatment and in August-
October after treatment in 2003 and 2004.  I collected pre-treatment data as a covariate 
for repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA).  Each plot contained six 1 m × 1 m 
subplots that were located at the plot corners and at the midpoints of the south and north 
plot edges.  Areal percent cover of plant species rooted in each subplot was categorized 
as 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, or 0.75% cover below 1% cover, at 1% intervals to 10% cover, and at 
5% intervals above 10% cover.  I also recorded species on a presence/absence basis on 
whole plots.  I calculated importance values (average of relative frequency and relative 
cover) for each species on each plot, and I assigned a frequency of 1 to species occurring 
only on whole plots for calculating importance values.  Nomenclature and native or 
exotic classifications follow USDA-NRCS (2004).   
I assessed sampling reproducibility by remeasuring a subplot every 3 plots, and 
by checking for consistency of species identification and detection on 2 plots inventoried 
twice by 2 different observers.  Repeated measurements for subplots on average differed 
from original measurements by 0.17 species/m2, and exhibited Sørensen similarities 
(based on percent cover) of 98%.  Repeated and original measurements for plots differed 
by 1 species/100 m2, and also varied by 1 species on average among observers who 
sampled plots during the experiment.  I was present during all sampling periods, and low 
measurement error suggests that results from this experiment represent actual occurrences 
and not sampling artifacts. 

 
 
144
I measured litterfall by installing 2 litter traps randomly located around the edge 
of each plot.  Traps consisted of a 0.15-m2 plastic bucket 30 cm tall.  I collected an Oi 
horizon sample of 1 m2 on each plot before treatment in April 2003, and I oven dried Oi 
and litterfall samples at 70°C.  I gravimetrically measured moisture of the 0-10 cm 
mineral soil on Oi removal and control plots by oven drying a 415-cm3 sample per plot at 
105°C for 24 hr.  Soil moisture was measured 9 June 2004 during the driest period of the 
year in this region when no measurable precipitation had fallen since April (Western 
Regional Climate Center, Reno, NV).   
Seed Bank Procedures 
I collected fifteen 208-cm3 seed bank samples per plot of the 0-5 cm A horizon 
from control and Oi removal plots, and combined these samples on a plot basis (18 
composite samples).  I also collected Oe+a samples from control plots in control 
restoration prescriptions (3 composite samples) and Oi samples from all control plots (9 
composite samples).  Oi and Oe+a samples were collected as grab samples each of ca. 15 
g (field moist), and I sieved Oi samples through a 4-mm sieve.  Samples were collected 
and started in a greenhouse on 25 June 2004.  I selected this collection and germination 
period to estimate which species may emerge in the field during monsoon rains typically 
beginning in July in this region.  I placed 120 cm3 of each horizon of each plot in separate 
700-cm3 plastic pots filled with 300 cm3 of sterile soil (United Industries Co., St Louis, 
MO), randomly arranged pots in a greenhouse maintained at 24°C without artificial 
lighting, watered samples daily, and monitored emergence for 6 months. 
Statistical Analysis 

 
 
145
 
I analyzed the response variables of species/m2, species/100 m2, and Shannon’s 
diversity index as a repeated measures ANOVA with pretreatment data as a covariate and 
restoration prescriptions as blocks using the following model: 2003 and 2004 y = 
covariate + blocks + scarification + Oi removal + scarification × Oi removal.  To track 
community compositional changes of individual plots across sampling periods, I 
computed Sørensen similarities for importance value and presence/absence data.  I 
compared Sørensen similarities among treatments using a 2-factor ANOVA model 
consisting of scarification and Oi removal with restoration prescriptions as blocks.  Raw 
data approximated equal variance and normality assumptions, and I performed analyses 
in SAS JMP (SAS Institute 2002).  I also ordinated community data (importance values) 
with successional vectors using non-metric multidimensional scaling (autopilot, thorough 
mode) in PC-ORD (McCune and Mefford 1999).   
RESULTS 
 
Forest-floor treatments did not significantly affect species richness or diversity 
during the 2-year experiment based on repeated measures ANOVA (Table 6.2).  The 
covariate (pre-treatment data) and blocks (restoration prescription) were significant in all 
ANOVA models, indicating only that the covariate was correlated with post-treatment 
data and that the restoration prescriptions differed before and after treatment reducing 
variance in treatment means.  Time was significant only for species/m2, with slight 
increases occurring on average across all treatments from 2003 to 2004 (Fig. 6.1).   
 
High Sørensen similarities averaging > 75% indicated that little compositional 
change occurred between post-treatment 2003 and 2004 measurements for individual 
plots in any treatment (Fig. 6.2).  Lower similarities between pre- and post-treatment 

 
 
146
2003 measurements simply reflect season-of-sampling effects (spring versus fall) since 
similarities did not differ significantly among treatments.  Successional trajectories from 
repeated-measures community ordination provided no evidence that plots of like forest-
floor treatments converged in species composition, indicating only loose groupings of 
plots within restoration prescriptions (Fig. 6.3).   
 
Forest-floor treatments had no clear effect on frequencies of individual species, 
with only restoration prescription and time effects apparent for some species (Table 6.3).  
Exotic species Linaria dalmatica (Dalmatian toadflax) and Verbascum thapsus (common 
mullein) were more frequent in restoration than in control prescriptions, with seedlings of 
V. thapsus increasing in frequency from 2003 to 2004.  Short-lived but primarily native 
species including the annuals Chenopodium graveolens (fetid goosefoot), Muhlenbergia 
minutissima (annual muhly), and Nama dichotomum (wishbone fiddleleaf) also were 
more frequent in restoration prescriptions and exhibited overall increases through time.  
The annual Laennecia schiedeana (pineland marshtail) and Pinus ponderosa seedlings, 
however, sharply decreased from 2003 to 2004, but these decreases appeared largely 
independent of forest-floor treatments.  In contrast, frequencies of the perennials Carex 
geophila, Festuca arizonica, Geranium caespitosum (pineywoods geranium), 
Muhlenbergia montana, Poa fendleriana, and Solidago velutina (three-nerve goldenrod) 
changed little or not at all during the experiment.  
 
Nine species emerged from seed bank samples collected in 2004, with Elymus 
elymoides the most frequent (Fig. 6.4).  Gnaphalium exilifolium (slender cudweed), an 
annual, was the only species detected in seed bank samples that did not occur in the 
aboveground vegetation of at least one plot.  Seed density averaged less than 300 

 
 
147
seeds/m2 except for a higher density in Oi horizons of control forest-floor treatments in 
intensive restoration prescriptions.  This high average density of 1250 seeds/m2 occurred 
because of one plot containing an unusually high seed density.  Approximately equal seed 
densities were detected in A-horizon samples from control and Oi removal forest-floor 
treatments, and A-horizon seed densities in the control forest-floor treatment were 
identical among restoration prescriptions          
DISCUSSION 
Absence of Treatment Effects 
 
Scarification and Oi removal forest-floor treatments had no measurable effect on 
plant community composition or species richness during the 2-year experiment, and 
successional trajectories provided little evidence for potential long-term effects (Fig. 6.3).  
Sampling included complete species inventories of well-replicated plots and was 
reproducible across years, ruling out inadequate sampling as a reason for the observed 
absence of treatment effects.  Results contrast with many other published studies in a 
variety of forest types where some type of community response to litter manipulations 
has occurred in less than 3 years (Beatty and Sholes 1988, Carson and Peterson 1990, 
Vellend et al. 2000).  Furthermore, Xiong and Nilsson’s (1999) meta-analysis found that 
effects of litter manipulations on plant establishment were greater in field than in 
greenhouse experiments, in 2-year versus 1-year experiments, in communities with large 
amounts of litter, and in coniferous compared to deciduous forests, all of which 
characterized my experiment.  Treatments also were fairly drastic removing up to 2200 
kg of litter on a plot, and my plot sizes of 100 m2 were much larger than the ≤  1 m2 in 

 
 
148
many litter experiments although treatment effects did not occur in my experiment at 1-
m2 grains either. 
Limitations to Treatment Response 
 
A number of factors may have limited ground-flora responses to treatments in this 
experiment, including climate, Pinus ponderosa-associated variables other than litter, 
grazing, competition with existing vegetation, nutrients, and seed limitations 
(DiTommaso and Aarssen 1989).  A period of below-average annual precipitation has 
occurred in the study area since 1999 after restoration treatments were implemented, and 
2002 was a particularly dry year before my experiment was initiated (Fig. 6.4).  However, 
growing-season and total precipitation were near or slightly above normal during both 
post-treatment years in 2003-2004.   
High densities of Pinus ponderosa in post-settlement forests are well known to 
reduce understory vegetation, presumably from shading, allelopathic litter production, 
and competition for water (Moir 1966, Lodhi and Killingbeck 1982, Naumburg and 
DeWald 1999).  For example, plant cover and diversity increased during trenching 
experiments severing P. ponderosa roots in Oregon (Riegel et al. 1992) and in Northern 
Arizona (Fulé et al. 2001b).  Although tree densities were sharply reduced in restoration 
prescriptions in my experiment (Table 6.1), there was no trend for effects of forest-floor 
treatments to be greater on lower tree density plots.  Tree densities in restoration 
prescriptions still exceeded presettlement densities by ca. 100-300 trees/ha, however, and 
may still have been too high for forest-floor treatments to elicit a response (McLaughlin 
1978, Moore and Deiter 1992, Abella and Covington 2004).    

 
 
149
 
Grazing by livestock and other ungulates affects community composition in 
northern Arizona Pinus ponderosa forests (Clary 1975).  Although livestock grazing has 
been excluded from the study area since at least 1998, Huffman and Moore (2003) found 
that heavy Cervus elaphus (Rocky Mountain elk) grazing reduced Ceanothus fendleri 
(buckbrush) in the study area.  Grazing thus may have affected composition during my 
experiment.  Since plant cover averaged < 10% on plots in this experiment, it does not 
seem plausible that all niches and microsites were filled and that competition from 
existing vegetation precluded a treatment response.  Nutrient availability could have been 
limiting, but prescribed burning before this experiment may have released nutrients at 
least in the short term (Covington and Sackett 1986, Kaye and Hart 1998).   
 
Seed bank data indicated that A-horizon seed banks were sparse or essentially 
absent, and aside from one plot, few seeds were trapped in O horizons so few seeds were 
likely removed by forest-floor treatments (Fig. 6.3).  Sparse seed banks particularly of 
perennial forbs also were previously reported in the study area (Vose and White 1987, 
Korb et al. 2004) and typify many northern Arizona Pinus ponderosa forests (Abella 
2005).  In their seed budget study, Vose and White (1987) also found that seed rain was 
fairly impoverished, ranging from 14-547 seeds/m2/yr and concentrated around existing 
plants.  Propagule limitations have been reported in about 50% of seed-augmentation 
experiments, and have been particularly severe in communities such as in my experiment 
that exhibit sparse seed banks, paltry aboveground vegetation producing few seeds, and 
much bare ground (Turnbull et al. 2000).  Seeding and outplanting have shown success in 
the limited areas in which they have been studied in Arizona P. ponderosa forests (Steed 

 
 
150
and DeWald 2003, Springer and Laughlin 2004), and testing for propagule limitation in 
these forests is an important research need.   
Potential Long-Term Species Composition 
 
Species composition and diversity at the onset of this experiment did differ 
between controls and restoration prescriptions that included thinning and burning, 
consistent with previous research at these sites completed in 2002 (Abella and Covington 
2004).  Aside from transitions in Pinus ponderosa seedlings and short-lived species like 
Laennecia schiedeana, Chenopodium graveolens and Verbascum thapsus, community 
composition as a whole was fairly stagnant in restoration prescriptions in 2003-2004 
during the present experiment (Table 6.3).  Apparently there was an initial increase in 
plant cover after the 1998-1999 restoration treatments, driven primarily by species such 
as Carex geophila that do form fairly large persistent seed banks, but little change since.  
Bartha et al. (2003) reported a similar pattern in a 40-yr study of a New Jersey old-field 
succession, where the number of colonizing species rapidly declined after the first few 
years of succession.  However, increases in colonization rates then occurred after dry 
years during “colonization windows” in their study, which has not occurred to date in the 
present experiment except possibly for undesirable species like V. thapsus.  The biennial 
V. thapsus, usually thought to rapidly decline following initial post-disturbance increases 
(Gross and Werner 1978), remained frequent in restoration areas, even sharply increasing 
on control forest-floor plots in the intensive restoration prescription 6 years after 
restoration treatments (Table 6.3).  Although this species was not detected in my seed 
bank samples, possibly because its germination requirements were not met at the time of 

 
 
151
sample collection (Baskin and Baskin 1981), this species is known to form large and 
persistent seed banks (Gross and Werner 1978).   
Extensive bare ground providing colonization sites for exotic species such as 
Verbascum thapsus is a concern given increasing unease about exotic species invasions in 
northern Arizona forests (Sieg et al. 2003).  Since these unoccupied microsites could 
continue to fill with exotics like V. thapsus, Linaria dalmatica, or additional undesirable 
species that are not presently found in current species pools, a conservative management 
strategy is to test seeding or outplanting of native perennials for vegetating unoccupied 
ground.                    
Non-Significant Results  
 
This paper reports a main finding of “no treatment effect” on plant communities 
from fairly drastic forest-floor manipulations in a well-sampled experiment that likely 
would have detected trends had they existed.  Under-reporting of non-statistically 
significant but properly collected and analyzed data, a form of publication bias, has long 
been suspected in ecology and increasingly is being quantitatively assessed (Møller and 
Jennions 2001, Murtaugh 2002).  Reporting of non-significant results is particularly 
important to avoid biasing meta-analyses, which are increasingly used to synthesize 
research findings in ecology (Osenberg et al. 1999, Gurevitch and Hedges 1999).  Results 
of my experiment contrast sharply with results of most published papers in a recent meta-
analysis of leaf-litter manipulation experiments, which found strong treatment effects in 
many other ecosystems (Xiong and Nilsson 1999).  This does not mean that leaf litter has 
no influence on plant communities in Pinus ponderosa forests, but rather that treatment 
responses were precluded by other factors important to identify in future research to find 

 
 
152
ways to increase native plant cover.  If seed shortages prevented responses, for example, 
it is unclear whether seeding would be more successful with or without litter.  This 
experiment portrays that economically and ecologically effective treatments 
supplementary to thinning and burning still need to be identified and tested for promoting 
native vegetation more rapidly in restoration P. ponderosa ecosystems.

CHAPTER 7 
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
 
This research developed a forest ecosystem classification on a 110,000-ha 
northern Arizona ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) landscape (Chapter 3), determined 
environmental gradients associated with plant community distribution and classified 
ecological species groups (Chapter 4), measured soil seed bank composition and 
responses to fire-related cues (Chapter 5), and assessed plant community dynamics after 
forest-floor manipulations in an existing ponderosa pine restoration experiment (Chapter 
6).  Major conclusions I have drawn from these studies include the following: 
 
1. Forest sites on this landscape could be readily classified into ecosystem types 
internally similar in environmental and vegetational characteristics.  Such an 
ecosystem framework improves our understanding and aptitude for estimating 
variability in ecological properties such as soil moisture and resource levels 
across forest landscapes.   
2. Soil properties such as texture reflecting parent materials were closely associated 
with ecosystem distribution.  In contrast to many landscapes, geomorphic 
variables were not closely associated with the distribution of most ecosystems.   
3. Diameter increment of old-growth ponderosa pine could be estimated fairly 
accurately based on ecosystem distribution.   

 
 
172
4. Ecosystem turnover occurs at broad extents on this landscape, and restoration 
must accordingly operate across large areas to encompass ecosystem diversity. 
5. Owing to the persistence of environmental features on which the ecosystem 
classification was based, the ecosystem framework provides a reference for the 
nature and distribution of ecosystem types in both presettlement and 
contemporary forests. 
6. Plant species composition differed markedly among ecosystems in contemporary 
forests.  Groups of species occupied characteristic environmental complexes, and 
species distributions closely corresponded with spatial variation in ponderosa pine 
growth. 
7. A few key environmental variables readily predicted distributions of major 
graminoids and forbs across the landscape.  These variables include soil texture, 
total N, rock cover, and geographic precipitation patterns.  
8. Soil seed bank composition was partly ecosystem specific.  Several native 
graminoids were detected in seed bank samples, whereas perennial forbs were 
sparse.  Seed banks can supply propagules of desirable natives such as mountain 
muhly (Muhlenbergia montana) and muttongrass (Poa fendleriana) in several 
ecosystems on this landscape.   
9. Liquid smoke increased emergence from seed bank samples in greenhouse 
experiments, suggesting that fire-related cues may be important in regulating 
post-burning responses in ponderosa pine communities. 

 
 
173
10.  In the forest-floor experiment, Oi removal and scarification had no detectable 
influence on understory composition or diversity in two post-treatment years.  
Several factors could have precluded a response, including climate.  Seed 
availability may have been particularly limiting for native perennial forbs.   
 
Based on this research, I identify the following topics in need of additional study: 
 
 
1. Rare ecosystems such as springs or deep ravines I did not study could be included 
in a future ecosystem classification.  These may be keystone ecosystems that if 
restored could provide large gains in biodiversity and ecosystem function.   
2. Ecosystem classification could be applied to other southwestern ponderosa pine 
landscapes to examine within and among landscape patterns in ecosystem 
composition and reference conditions. 
3. Assessing whether presettlement tree densities, patterns, or fire regimes show any 
consistent trends among ecosystems or can be predicted from abiotic variables 
may assist reference condition estimation.  These variables may be partly 
ecosystem specific or specific to groups of ecosystems if they were affected by 
site environments in presettlement forests.  On the other hand, variables such as 
tree spatial patterns could be more closely related to microsite ecology or other 
factors largely independent of landscape ecosystems. 
4. Studying whether different ecosystem types respond differently to restoration or 
require different levels of treatments could assist restoration planning.  For 
example, does understory vegetation in productive ecosystems respond more 

 
 
174
rapidly to thinning and burning than understory vegetation in unproductive 
ecosystems? 
5. Determining reference conditions for herbaceous vegetation is challenging.  Can 
herbarium records or other methods be used to provide clues to past ecosystem-
specific species composition on this landscape? 
6. Fire cues affected emergence from seed bank samples in a greenhouse 
experiment.  These findings need to be tested in the field where factors such as 
timing of burns may be important.   
7. The forest-floor experiment could be expanded to include trenching, seed 
addition, or other treatments to ascertain understory responses to these 
manipulations.
