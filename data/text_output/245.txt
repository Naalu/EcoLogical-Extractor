‘‘Minimal-Impact’’ Restoration Treatments Have
Limited Effects on Forest Structure and
Fuels at Grand Canyon, USA

Abstract
Restoration treatments were tested on the South Rim
(ponderosa pine) and North Rim (mixed conifer) of
Grand Canyon National Park, never-harvested forests
where the historically frequent surface regime was inter-
rupted in the late 19th century. Treatments were designed
for ‘‘minimal impact’’ by limiting the size of trees to be
thinned and minimizing mechanical equipment. Treat-
ments included (1) thinning of small trees (diameter •
12.7 cm) and prescribed ﬁre; (2) thinning of small trees
located close to large old trees and prescribed ﬁre; (3)
prescribed ﬁre only; and (4) control. On the South Rim,
density declined by 23–45% but basal area only by 9–
14%. On the North Rim, density was reduced 32–68%
and basal area declined 18–31%. Declines of 5–8% were
observed in these same variables in the controls. Surface
fuels were signiﬁcantly reduced in all burned treatments
(70–84% reduction in forest ﬂoor, 66–76% reduction in
woody
debris).
However,
canopy
cover
was
nearly
unchanged, and canopy fuel loads were not signiﬁcantly
reduced, although canopy base heights increased. The
experiment accomplished the goal of minimally impacting
the forest ecosystem but the effects of small-tree thinning
plus burning were nearly indistinguishable from those of
burning alone. All the treated units were left with modest
gain in resistance to severe wildﬁres but in conditions still
far removed from preﬁre-exclusion conditions.
Key words: ecological restoration, ﬁre, fuel reduction,
Southwest.
Introduction
Ecological restoration and fuel reduction treatments are of
increasing interest in forest ecosystems adapted to histori-
cal regimes of frequent surface ﬁres because these forests
have grown dense and now support severe wildﬁres
(Swetnam et al. 1999). Although the terms ‘‘restoration’’
and ‘‘fuel reduction’’ are sometimes used interchangeably,
they have distinct meanings. Fuel reduction refers to treat-
ments that remove surface and canopy fuels in order to
alter ﬁre behavior from crown ﬁre to surface ﬁre. Fuel
reduction treatments can be assessed by means of model-
ing ﬁre behavior (e.g., Scott 1998; Stephens 1998; Brose &
Wade 2002) or by evaluating ﬁre behavior and effects
under actual wildﬁre conditions (Pollet & Omi 2002). Eco-
logical restoration, in contrast, refers to ‘‘the process of
assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been
degraded, damaged, or destroyed’’ (Society for Ecological
Restoration International 2002). In long-needled pine for-
ests adapted to surface ﬁre regimes, such as ponderosa
pine (scientiﬁc names of all species are listed in Table 1),
ecological restoration includes practices aimed at emulat-
ing historical forest structure by conserving old trees and
thinning dense young trees, allowing native understory
vegetation to recover, and reintroducing surface ﬁre as
a key ecological process (Covington et al. 1997; Allen et al.
2002). Because surface ﬁre was the predominant natural
disturbance in ponderosa pine forests over their evolution-
ary history, ecological restoration is consistent with goals
of fuel reduction in this ecosystem type, though the
reverse is not necessarily true (Moore et al. 1999).
National parks occupy an unusual position with respect to
ecological restoration treatments. The so-called dual mandate
of the Organic Act of the National Park Service (NPS), call-
ing for both conservation of nature and human ‘‘enjoyment’’
of the scenery, was initially taken to mean preservation of the
attractive elements of the ecosystem (Sellars 1997). Following
the Leopold report in 1963, NPS ecologists called for restora-
tion of dynamic ecosystem processes, especially ﬁre (Pyne
1982). However, while recognizing that profound changes
have occurred in surface ﬁre–adapted forests, NPS has
focused on ﬁre use as the main or only means of restoration.
Grand Canyon National Park protects important exam-
ples of southwestern forest ecosystems because there has
been no tree harvesting, grazing has been somewhat
restricted, and there are a few relict areas where surface
ﬁre regimes have continued up to the present (Fule´ et al.
2003). The park has an active wildland ﬁre-use program,
but due to the dense forest conditions, there have been
several costly and publicized escaped ﬁres in recent years,
leading to recommendations by NPS review teams that

the park should investigate alternative means of treat-
ment, including tree thinning (Nichols et al. 1994).
We compared forest restoration treatments in Grand
Canyon National Park to develop information for conser-
vation planning. Because NPS does not routinely cut trees,
the project was considered controversial, and it was impor-
tant to minimize the size of the treated units. Therefore, we
selected sites that were intended to represent forest and
fuel conditions over broad portions of the Park. We asked
the following questions: (1) Were minimal-impact treat-
ments effective in restoring historical forest characteristics?
(2) Were minimal-impact treatments effective in reducing
hazardous fuels? and (3) What are the implications of alter-
native treatments for management of Grand Canyon
National Park and other forested preserves?
Methods
Study Area
The South Rim site was located in the largest forested area
on the south side of Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona,
at an elevation of 2,290 m and lat 35579450N, long
111579480W. Overstory species composition was dominated
by ponderosa pine and Gambel oak, with occasional Utah
juniper and pinyon (scientiﬁc names of all species are in
Table1). Prior to the onset of ﬁre exclusion after 1887, mean
ﬁre frequency averaged 6.9 year for all ﬁres and 9.5 year for
ﬁres scarring 25% or more of ﬁre-scarred samples in the
landscape surrounding the study site (Fule´ et al. 2003). At
Grand Canyon Village (elevation 2,125 m), average annual
precipitation is 36.8 cm, with an average snowfall of 177.5
cm; average July maximum temperature is 29C; and aver-
age January minimum temperature is 21C (all climate data
from Western Regional Climate Center, www.wrcc.dri.edu).
The North Rim study site was located in the mixed
conifer forest type, at an elevation of 2,500 m, lat
36209070N, long 112149450W. Mixed conifer forest, pre-
viously dominated by ponderosa pine but invaded by
shade-tolerant species (especially white ﬁr but also spru-
ces, aspen, and Douglas-ﬁr), has presented the greatest
challenge for restoration of surface ﬁre. The study site
bordered the Northwest III escaped ﬁre of 1993, which led
to recommendations for testing thinning to reduce fuels.
Mean ﬁre frequency prior to 1879 averaged 5.5 year for all
ﬁres and 9.0 year for ﬁres scarring 25% or more of ﬁre-
scarred samples in the landscape surrounding the study
site (Fule´ et al. 2003). Average annual precipitation at the
North Rim Ranger Station (elevation 2,564 m) is 64.7 cm,
with an average snowfall of 356 cm. Temperatures range
from an average July maximum of 25.1C to an average
January minimum of 28.2C.
Dry conditions prevailed in northern Arizona throughout
this study. Precipitation between 1999 and 2003 was only
79% of the long-term average at the South Rim (data
missing in 1997–1998); between 1997 and 2003, precipitation
was 87% of the long-term average at Bright Angel weather
station on the North Rim (period of record, 1948–2003).
Treatment Design
We originally designed a range of alternatives from ﬁre-
only to progressively higher levels of thinning, with a com-
panion experimental site on the Kaibab National Forest
(Fule´ et al. 2002b). Treatments were delayed in the Park,
however, because of public opposition to tree cutting.
Because the Park sites were treated later than the Kaibab
site, the experimental design was reduced to before–after
control–impact comparisons (Stewart-Oaten et al. 1992).
In 2002, NPS staff recast the environmental analysis in the
context of reducing hazardous fuels, rather than strictly
ecological restoration, proposing:
(1) a modiﬁed ecological restoration treatment (restore)
designed to emulate the structure of preﬁre-exclusion
forests, treat fuels, and restore ﬁre in prescription; this
treatment followed the design of ‘‘full-restoration’’
treatments in southwestern forests (e.g., Covington
et al. 1997; Fule´ et al. 2002b; Waltz et al. 2003), with
the important exception of a 5-inch (12.7 cm diameter
at breast height [dbh], 1.37 m) cap on tree cutting.
(2) a minimal thinning treatment (minimal) designed to
reduce ﬁre hazard and facilitate prescribed ﬁre; this treat-
ment also included a 5-inch (12.7 cm) cap on tree cutting.
(3) a burn-only treatment (burn).
(4) a control treatment (control).

The reference condition selected for the restoration
thinning was the preﬁre-exclusion pattern of tree species
composition and spatial arrangement (Covington et al.
1997; Mast et al. 1999). Living trees of all species that
pre-dated ﬁre exclusion were retained. Wherever evidence
of remnant old material was encountered (snags, stumps,
logs), several of the largest younger trees of the same
species within 9.1 m were retained as replacements. If suit-
able trees were not found within 9.1 m, the search radius
was extended to 18.2 m. Each remnant was replaced with
1.5 trees (i.e., three replacements per every two rem-
nants), if the replacements were 40.6 cm dbh or larger,
otherwise each remnant was replaced with three trees.
The reason for varying the replacement rate was to retain
more trees if they were smaller, because smaller trees con-
tribute less biomass and may have a greater chance of
mortality (Waltz et al. 2003). This treatment would have
resulted in a substantial thinning of understory trees,
except that only trees with dbh less than 12.7 cm were cut.
Juniper, pinyon, oak, or aspen trees were not cut because
these species were considered relatively susceptible to ﬁre.
The minimal treatment was intended to help protect
living preﬁre-exclusion trees from crown ﬁre by interrupt-
ing the horizontal and vertical continuity of canopy fuels.
Around each old tree, young trees were thinned in a radius
ranging from 12 to 18 m, proportional to the height of the
old tree. The thinned area was oval shaped, with the long
axis oriented to provide maximum protection from the
prevailing southwestern wind direction and/or from down-
slope ﬁres. Within the thinning area, cutting nearest each
old tree was similar to the restoration treatment, with
nearly all young trees removed. Toward the outer edges of
the thinning radius, the thinning was feathered into the
unthinned surrounding stand. Only trees with dbh less
than 12.7 cm were cut.
In both the restoration and minimal treatments, we
raked accumulated forest ﬂoor fuels approximately 30 cm
from the base of the boles of old-growth trees in order to
minimize the cambial girdling by ﬁre. The burn treatment
was intended to imitate current management practices in
the park, so fuels were not raked from tree boles.
Northern Arizona Conservation Corps crews thinned
trees in 2002, using chain saws at the South Rim site. At
the North Rim site, managed under Wilderness guidelines,
NPS staff applied a minimum tool analysis and recom-
mended the use of hand tools to cut trees (Fig. 1). Slash
was piled by hand in small (approximately 1.5–2 m high)
piles. Sites were burned under conditions deemed by NPS
ﬁre managers to be safe in terms of expected ﬁre behavior
and availability of resources to handle escaped ﬁres. Such
conditions typically occur in the fall in northern Arizona.
The South Rim site was burned in a prescribed ﬁre on 5
November 2003. Winds averaged 0–10 km/h, maximum
temperature was 8C, and relative humidity ranged from
30 to 37%. Ignition was done with strip headﬁres. Flame
lengths averaged 10–30 cm in litter, reaching 30–90 cm in
fuel jackpots. The North Rim site was burned during
a wildland-use ﬁre, the ‘‘Rose’’ ﬁre, on 25–26 October
2003. Winds averaged 5–14 km/hr, maximum temperature
was 14C, relative humidity ranged from 11 to 24%. Flame
lengths averaged 12 cm in litter, reaching 10–20 m in fuel
jackpots.
Field Sampling
Treatments were randomly assigned to four forest units
per site, each approximately 8 ha in size (actual range 7.6–
13.2 ha). We established 20 permanent monitoring plots in
each unit between July and October 1997, on a 60-m grid.
Overstory trees taller than breast height (137 cm) were
measured on a 400-m2 (11.28 m-radius), circular ﬁxed-area
plot. Species, condition (living or snag/log classes), and
dbh were recorded for all trees over breast height. We
identiﬁed potentially preﬁre-exclusion ponderosa pine
trees based on size (>40-cm diameter at stump height
[dsh], 40 cm above ground level) or yellowed bark (Mast
et al. 1999). We considered trees of other species as poten-
tially pre-dating ﬁre exclusion if dsh greater than 40 cm
(white ﬁr, spruce, Douglas-ﬁr), or dsh greater than 20 cm
(aspen, juniper, oak, pinyon) (Fule´ et al. 2002a). All
potentially preﬁre-exclusion trees, as well as a random
10% subsample of other trees, were cored with an incre-
ment borer at 40 cm above ground level to determine the
age and past growth. We recorded tree canopy cover
along a 50-m line transect oriented upslope through the
plot center. We measured dead woody biomass and forest
ﬂoor depth on a 15.2-m planar transect (Brown 1974) in
a random direction from each plot center.
After treatment, we remeasured the study sites between
May and July 2004, adding measurements of total height,
crown base height, crown scorch, and bole char.
Figure 1. Trees at the North Rim study site were thinned by the
Northern Arizona Conservation Corps using hand tools, the
‘‘minimal tool’’ selected because the area is managed as proposed
Wilderness. The handsaw shown here may be one of the
smallest implements applied in forest thinning in the
western United States.

Laboratory, Statistical, and Modeling Analysis
We surfaced and crossdated increment cores (Stokes &
Smiley 1968). Rings were counted on cores that could not be
crossdated. Forest structure was reconstructed at the time of
disruption of the frequent ﬁre regime, 1887 on the South
Rim and 1879 on the North Rim, using dendroecological
methods. These methods have been described in detail and
the accuracy of reconstructions was compared to historical
data by Fule´ et al. (2002a, b) and Moore et al. (2004). Tree
size at the time of ﬁre exclusion was reconstructed by sub-
tracting the radial growth measured on increment cores. The
death date of dead trees was estimated based on tree condi-
tion class using diameter-dependent snag decomposition
rates. We applied locally developed species-speciﬁc relation-
ships between tree diameter and basal area increment to esti-
mate growth between the ﬁre exclusion date and death date.
Canopy fuel load was estimated with allometric equa-
tions for foliage and ﬁne twigs of ponderosa pine (Fule´
et al. 2001), Gambel oak (Clary & Tiedemann 1987),
pinyon and juniper (Grier et al. 1992), Douglas-ﬁr (Gower
et al. 1992), and white ﬁr, Engelmann spruce, and aspen
(Ter-Mikaelian & Korzuhkin 1997). We calculated diame-
ter at root collar for pinyon, juniper, and Gambel oak
(Chojnacky 1999). We estimated canopy volume by the
averages of tree height (top of the canopy) and crown base
height (bottom of the canopy). Canopy bulk density was
calculated as canopy biomass divided by canopy volume.
We compared forest variables between treatments
and over time (pre- and post-treatment) using repeated-
measures analysis of variance with Systat software (SPSS,
Richmond, CA, U.S.A.). The 20 plots in each treatment
unit were pseudoreplicates, because only one instance of
each experimental treatment was implemented at each
site. Inferences are therefore limited to these particular
sites. As discussed below, however, the study sites are rep-
resentative of much larger areas. Variables were square
root transformed where necessary to meet analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) assumptions of normality and homosce-
dasticity. Alpha level was 0.05. Following a statistically
signiﬁcant ANOVA result, treatment means were com-
pared with a post hoc Tukey’s procedure.
Results
Forest density increased by approximately an order of
magnitude between the date of the last surface ﬁre (1887)
and the pre-treatment measurements in 1997 at the South
Rim
(Table 2).

between 1887 and 1997 (p ¼ 0.02). There were no signiﬁ-
cant differences in density between treatment units in
1887, but several units differed by 1997. Ponderosa pine
made up 46–63% of tree density in 1887, with the range
increasing to 31–94% by 1997. Total basal area rose signif-
icantly (p < 0.001), from 5.9–11.7 m2/ha to 22.4–25.0 m2/
ha. Basal area did not differ between treatment units in
1879 or 1997. The proportion of ponderosa pine basal area
was relatively consistent, comprising 83–95% of the total
basal area in 1887 and 76–87% in 1997. Almost all of the
remaining trees were Gambel oaks.
Increases in density and basal area were less striking at
the North Rim, but composition shifted toward shade-tol-
erant species between 1879 and 1997 (Table 3). Average
tree density increased from 230 to 1,413 trees/ha (p <
0.001); treatment units did not differ signiﬁcantly in den-
sity in 1879 or 1997. Basal area rose (p < 0.001), from
16.9–23.8 m2/ha to 40.2–46.7 m2/ha. There were no signiﬁ-
cant differences in basal area between treatment units in
1879 or 1997. Ponderosa pine declined as a proportion of
basal area, from an average of 73% of total basal area in
1879 to only 49% by 1997. White ﬁr rose from 22% of
total basal area in 1879 to 35% in 1997; the other shade-
tolerant species increased from 5% of total basal area in
1879 to 16% in 1997.
Treatments cut or killed large numbers of small trees
but led to a relatively minor basal area reduction (Tables 2
& 3). On the South Rim, tree density in the control area
declined by 5% and basal area dropped by 6%. The res-
toration, minimal, and burning treatment units had signiﬁ-
cant reductions in tree density of 45, 47, and 23%,
respectively, but basal area decline was only 9, 19, and
14%, respectively. The basal area decline was signiﬁcant
over time (p ¼ 0.006) but not by treatment. Assuming that
the treatment units would have had background mortality
similar to the control, the treatment effects on basal area
reduction could have been as small as 3–13%. In the two
treatments involving tree cutting, thinning removed an
average of 158 trees/ha in the restoration unit and 103
trees/ha in the minimal unit. Cut trees made up 43% of
trees killed in the restoration treatment and only 16% of
those killed in the minimal treatment. In the burn

treatment, fewer than 3 trees/ha were cut, less than 2% of
the 241 trees/ha killed in this treatment.
North Rim units experienced greater decline in basal
area in absolute measurements, but the proportional
effects of treatments were strikingly similar to those of the
South Rim. Tree density in the control area declined by
7% and in basal area by 8%. The restoration and minimal
units declined 68 and 59% in density, respectively, to
a level signiﬁcantly below that of the control. The burn
unit declined by 32% but was not statistically signiﬁcantly
different from the control. Basal area decline was less: val-
ues across burned units were 20, 31, and 18%. Basal area
declines were statistically signiﬁcant over time (p < 0.001)
and by treatment (p ¼ 0.043), but none of the treatment
means was signiﬁcantly different from each other in 2004.
Assuming that the treatment units would have had back-
ground mortality similar to the control, the treatment
effects on lowering basal area could have been as little as
10–23%. More trees were thinned on the North Rim: thin-
ning removed an average of 600 trees/ha in the restoration
unit and 296 trees/ha in the minimal unit. Cut trees made
up 73% of trees killed in the restoration treatment and
42% of those killed in the minimal treatment. No trees
were cut in the burn treatment, where the post-treatment
density was an average of 504 trees/ha lower than the
pre-treatment density.
Diameter distributions were affected by the treatments
only in the lowest diameter classes (Figs. 2 & 3), under-
scoring the similarity in effects between the cutting treat-
ments and the burn-only treatment. Compared to the
reconstructed diameter distributions at the time of ﬁre
exclusion, all units had many more small-diameter trees in
2004. Larger diameter tree densities were relatively much
closer, though still slightly higher, than historical densities.

Fire damage to trees was less on the South Rim than on
the North Rim, consistent with the differences observed in
ﬁre behavior. Bole char averaged 1.1 m on the North Rim,
versus 0.6 m on the South Rim. Similarly, scorch height
averaged 3.5 m on the North Rim, 75% higher than the
average of 2.0 m on the South Rim. Scorch volume, how-
ever, was similar at both sites, averaging 14% on the
South Rim and 19% on the North Rim.
Surface fuels declined signiﬁcantly in all the burned
treatments (Fig. 4): duff depths were reduced by an
average of 2.2 cm or 70% on the South Rim and 3.3 cm
or 84% on the North Rim (both sites: p < 0.001). Differ-
ences between treatments were not signiﬁcant prior to
treatment at the South Rim site, but one unit (restore)
was signiﬁcantly higher in duff depth than the other
North Rim units. After treatment, however, all noncon-
trol units had signiﬁcantly less duff than the controls.
Woody debris was reduced signiﬁcantly from an average
of 27.5 to 6.5 Mg/ha on the South Rim (76%). North
Rim woody debris declined from an average of 83.6 to
28.6 Mg/ha (66%) (Fig. 5). Differences between treat-
ments were not signiﬁcant prior to treatment at either
site. The change over time was not signiﬁcant on the
North Rim (p ¼ 0.051), but noncontrol units on the
North Rim had signiﬁcantly less woody debris in 2004
(p < 0.001).
Canopy cover ﬂuctuated only 0–3% at either site
(Table 4). There were signiﬁcant differences between units
on the South Rim site (p ¼ 0.003), but these differences
were preexisting and were not affected by treatment. Can-
opy cover was not signiﬁcantly different between treat-
ments or over time at the North Rim.
Canopy fuel load rose signiﬁcantly from an average of
2.4 Mg/ha in 1887 to 6.1 Mg/ha in 1997 at the South Rim,

an increase of approximately 250% (p < 0.001) (Table 5).
On the North Rim, canopy fuel load rose signiﬁcantly
from 7.1 Mg/ha in 1879 to 13.9 Mg/ha in 1997 (p < 0.001).
There were no signiﬁcant differences between treatment
units at either site. After treatment, canopy fuel load
declines were not signiﬁcant. The largest decline on the
South Rim was 15%, in the minimal unit; the largest
North Rim decline was 27%, also in the minimal unit.
During the same period, canopy bulk density in the con-
trols increased by 8 and 3%. Stand heights were not signif-
icantly different between treatments within sites, but
canopy base heights in 2004 were signiﬁcantly higher in all
three treatments relative to the controls at both sites (p <
0.001). Canopy bulk density values differed signiﬁcantly
between treatments only at the North Rim (p ¼ 0.02),
where the value was signiﬁcantly higher in the restoration
treatment than in the burn treatment.
Discussion
Effects of Minimal-Impact Treatments
Declines of 70–84% in duff depth and 66–76% in woody
debris were slightly greater than the declines reported in
previous ﬁndings. Studies have reported highly variable
results, reﬂecting fuel creation (thinning residues, falling
of scorched foliage) as well as consumption. Ffolliott et al.
(1977) found a 70–75% reduction in forest ﬂoor depth fol-
lowing prescribed burning near Flagstaff. In a larger repli-
cated experiment, Sackett and Haase (1998) reported a
decline of 41% in forest ﬂoor at Limestone Flat and 67%
at Chimney Spring in northern Arizona. Woody debris
was reduced 42 and 69%, respectively, at those sites
(Sackett & Haase 1998). Prescribed burning reduced duff
depth by 53% and woody debris by 43% on the Kaibab
National Forest, adjacent to the South Rim site. Thinning

and burning resulted in a 162% increase in woody debris in
a heavily thinned restoration unit but a 66% decrease in
a minimal thinning treatment (Fule´ et al. 2002b). Restora-
tion thinning and burning reduced duff depth an average of
46%, whereas woody fuel changes were highly variable
(257% to 155% change) in northwestern Arizona (Waltz
et al. 2003). Scott (1998) found minor ﬂuctuations (17% to
224% change) following thinning and burning in Montana.
Reduced surface fuel implies reduced spread and
intensity of surface ﬁre and reduced heat/area of soil sur-
face, compared to the pre-treatment condition. Because
canopy fuels were barely affected, however, the simulated
behavior of severe wildﬁres was essentially unaffected by
any of the minimal-impact restoration treatments. The
absence of change in canopy cover, canopy biomass or can-
opy bulk density indicates that the behavior of active crown
ﬁres would be essentially unmodiﬁed by the treatments,
similar to Scott’s (1998) ﬁndings with a ‘‘minimum-impact’’
thinning and burning treatment in Montana.
The signiﬁcantly higher canopy base heights in all the
burned treatments constituted the greatest treatment
impact on potential crown ﬁre behavior. In the absence of
pre-treatment measurements, we cannot exclude the pos-
sibility of preexisting differences in canopy base height,
but the consistent and strong trend toward higher values
in all the burned treatments is a strong evidence that the
treatments raised the base of the canopy and thus in-
creased the resistance to the transition from surface to
crown ﬁre (torching). Similar increases in resistance to
torching were observed across multiple thinning plus
burning and burn-only treatments in Arizona (Fule´ et al.
2001) and Montana (Scott 1998).

Management Implications
Minimal-impact treatments were successful in cutting hun-
dreds of trees per hectare and killing hundreds more with
ﬁre, but the effects were negligible for most canopy-
related variables. The NPS met the goal of minimal
impact to the forest by avoiding mechanized equipment
and by imposing the 12.7-cm diameter cap. However, eco-
logical restoration and hazardous fuel reduction goals
were only minimally advanced. Forest structure remained
substantially different from preﬁre-exclusion conditions,
with the treated South Rim units still averaging approxi-
mately 120% higher basal area in 2004 than in 1887. The
North Rim units were closer to historical conditions, aver-
aging 41% higher basal area in 2004 than in 1887. Because
the dominant forest trees were essentially unaffected by
treatments, understory vegetation and wildlife habitat are
unlikely to change substantially.
Future stand dynamics will be affected by the delayed
mortality of many ﬁre-damaged trees. In a review of the
literature on postﬁre mortality, Fowler and Sieg (2004)
suggested that values of percent crown scorch volume
greater than or equal to 80–95% for ponderosa pine or
greater than or equal to 70–95% for Douglas-ﬁr indicated
a probability greater than 80% of tree death within 3
years. On the South Rim, 12% of ponderosa trees in the
treatment units had scorch 80% and 4% had 95%
scorch. On the North Rim, 8% had scorch greater than or
equal to 80 and 4% had greater than or equal to 95%.
Douglas-ﬁr on the North Rim averaged 12% with scorch
greater than or equal to 70% and 10% with greater than
or equal to 95% scorch. White ﬁr mortality in the Sierra
Nevada covered a broad range, depending on the diame-
ter and tree size, for trees with 80% crown volume
scorched (Stephens & Finney 2002). At our North Rim
site, 11% of white ﬁr trees had 80% scorch. However,
even if all the trees at both sites with scorch  80% were
to die, basal area would be reduced by only approximately
4%. Other factors, such as bole char, soil heating, cambial
girdling, and interacting stresses from bark beetles and
drought (Wallin et al. 2003), will also play a role in deter-
mining the future mortality.
Maintenance prescribed burning is planned as a continu-
ing treatment for the study sites. Autumn ﬁres are within
the range of seasonal variability of the pre-European ﬁre
regime in the region, but the majority of natural ﬁres
occurred earlier in the year (Fule´ et al. 2003), under drier,
windier conditions and during the growing season when
plants are more susceptible to ﬁre. Based on experience
from interval burning studies in northern Arizona, re-
peated low-intensity ﬁre in the fall may have small beneﬁ-
cial impacts on tree growth (Peterson et al. 1994) and can
maintain low levels of forest ﬂoor material and woody
debris. But future burning is unlikely to foster further
changes in forest structure or affect canopy fuels unless
managers use special ﬁring techniques such as ring burn-
ing around dense patches of young trees (Sackett & Haase
1998) or allow a relatively intense headﬁre to pass through
the stands. Piling thinning slash around young white ﬁrs or
other trees that are present at densities well above historical
levels may be useful for enhancing ﬁre-caused mortality.
We found a rough equivalence between burn-only and
minimal thinning plus burning treatments. There are two
main implications. First, the differences between minimal
thinning and burning treatments appear to be so slight as
Table 4. Canopy cover (percent) before (1997) and after (2004) forest restoration treatments.

to bring into question the value of spending resources on
minimal thinning activities. The funds and personnel might
be better used in preparing additional burn blocks or moni-
toring wildland ﬁre-use ﬁres. Second, now having docu-
mented the limited efﬁcacy of restoration treatments under
a 5-inch cap, we recommend that NPS carry out a second
entry for thinning larger trees in the two 8-ha restoration
treatment units in accordance with the original ecological
restoration plan. The reduction in density of young but
large trees, whether through cutting or snag creation, may
come closer to meeting restoration and fuel reduction goals
in the surface ﬁre–adapted forests of Grand Canyon
National Park and the southwestern United States.
