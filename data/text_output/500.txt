During the last 150 years, two species of mesquite trees in the Southwestern United States have
become increasingly common in what formerly was desert grassland. These trees have spread from
nearby watercourses onto relatively xeric upland areas, decreasing rangeland grass production.
Management attempts to limit or reverse this spread have been largely unsuccessful. This paper
reviews studies regarding mesquite natural history and management strategies, emphasizing studies
published during the past decade. Mesquite possess a deep root system and are capable of fixing
atmospheric N, rendering them capable of accessing resources unavailable to other plants in open
rangeland. Their seeds, which remain viable for decades, have a hard exocarp and require scarification
before germination. Consumption by cattle provides a means of scarification and seed dispersal, and
is a major factor contributing to the spread of mesquite in open rangelands. Increases in atmospheric
CO2 and winter precipitation during the past century also contribute to enhanced seed germination.
Removal techniques have included herbicides, prescribed burning, grazing reduction, and mechanical
removal. For increased effectiveness of these techniques, management goals must be clearly
articulated; these goals include complete removal, no removal, and limited removal. Of these, limited
removal appears the most feasible, using an initial herbicide application followed by periodic prescribed
burning.

Introduction ____________________
Rangelands in the Southwestern United States
have been used for settlement, agriculture, and live-
stock ranching during the last 150 years. Because of
the gentle topography, sufficient available water, and
abundant forage, use of this rangeland—especially in
southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico
(fig. 1)—has been intensive. As a result, much of this
area has been transformed to a mixed-phase wood-
land or shrubland, with no sign of this trend di-
minishing (Archer and others 1988; Buffington and
Herbel 1965; Hastings and Turner 1965; McClaran
and Van Devender 1995). Figures 2–6 show repeat
photography that document this change at selected
sites in the region. The alteration of grassland to
shrubland has created considerable concern as land
use managers recognize a corresponding decline in
available livestock forage. The mesquite tree (Prosopis
spp.) has played a major role in this change, as it has
expanded its range from more sheltered and mesic
desert grassland drainage systems and riparian zones
to open rangelands.
While the causes that account for this altered distri-
bution—climate change (Grover and Music 1990),
livestock grazing (Archer and others 1988; Bahr and
Shelton 1993; Schlesinger and others 1990), suppres-
sion of wildfires (Bahre 1985; Biggs 1997; Humphrey
1958), or rodent effects (Cox and others 1993; Reynolds
and Glendening 1949)—have been investigated for
several decades, no single effective strategy has been
offered as a means of slowing or reversing mesquite
encroachment in desert grasslands. Removal tactics
have included fire (Britton and Wright 1970; Wright
and others 1976), herbicides (Gibbens and others
1986; Jacoby and others 1982; Warren and others
1996), and mechanical removal (Dodd and Holtz 1971).
These have resulted in varying degrees of success,
mainly short term.
One key to understanding why mesquite has ex-
panded its range, and why it may be at times impervi-
ous to attempts at removal, is through an examination

of its natural history. Though this has been studied in
the past, many studies concerning intraspecific com-
petition (Ansley and others 1998; Kramp and others
1998), seed germination requirements (Bush and
Van Auken 1990; Cox and others 1993), root systems
(Ansley and others 1990, 1991; Stromberg 1993), and
nitrogen fixation (Johnson and Mayeux 1990; Zitzer
and others 1996) have taken place only within the last
10 years.
In this study, we especially refer to the desert grass-
lands of southeastern Arizona and southwestern New
Mexico in the area shown in figure 1. Previous workers
(Brown and Lowe 1980) referred to two types of grass-
land in this region—semidesert grassland and plains
and Great Basin Desert grassland—but we prefer the
simpler classification of “desert grassland” as used by
McClaran and Van Devender (1995). We subdivide the
desert grasslands into the desert grasslands of south-
eastern Arizona, which mostly surround the Santa
Rita and Huachuca Mountains, and the desert grass-
lands of the western Chihuahuan Desert, which spans
the area from the Sulfur Springs Valley of southeast-
ern Arizona to the Bootheel of southwestern New
Mexico.
The objectives of this study are (1) to describe the
natural history of the mesquite species that have
increased their distribution within the Southwestern
United States, focusing on those attributes that could
account for this range expansion, (2) to review the
existing research that has addressed this expansion,
with an emphasis on research produced within the last
decade, (3) to describe management goals, practices,
and results, and (4) to propose a management strategy
that accounts for regional differences while providing
long-term effectiveness.

Arizona that contain desert grasslands (from Brown and Lowe 1980). This area includes what we refer to as
Sonoran and Chihuahuan Desert grasslands, defined by Brown and Lowe (1980) as semidesert grassland
and plains and Great Basin grassland.
States: screwbean mesquite (Prosopis pubescens
Benth.), velvet mesquite (Prosopis velutina Woot.),
and honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.). Two
subspecies of honey mesquite are found in this area:
Texas honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa var.
glandulosa Torr.) and western honey mesquite
(Prosopis glandulosa Torr. var. torreyana [L. Benson]
M.C. Johnston). They are members of the legume
family (Fabaceae) and are characterized by pinnate
leaves, spiny branches, seedpods, and a central tap-
root. However, individual variation in physical char-
acteristics as well as hybridization makes taxonomic
classification at the species level problematic. In
general, P. glandulosa can be differentiated from
P. velutina because the former has glabrous leaflets
up to 4 cm long; the latter has pubescent leaflets up
to 1.3 cm long. The two varieties of P. glandulosa are
distinguished by their spines; P. glandulosa var.
torreyana has paired thorns, while P. glandulosa var.
glandulosa has solitary thorns (Isely 1998).
Two of these species, P. glandulosa and P. velutina,
have had the most significant expansion into desert
grasslands. While P. velutina is restricted in the United
States to southern and central Arizona, P. glandulosa

occurs from Texas to California. P. glandulosa var.
glandulosa is found mainly in Texas east of the Pecos
river and north into Oklahoma, while P. glandulosa
var. torreyana is found west of the Pecos river, through-
out southern New Mexico and adjacent Arizona, and
in southern California, northwestern Arizona, south-
ern Nevada, and southwestern Utah. P. glandulosa
var. glandulosa can also be found along Interstate 10
through New Mexico and Arizona east of Tucson due
to cattle transport with subsequent seed dispersal. In
this paper we assume that Prosopis velutina and the
two subspecies of P. glandulosa are sufficiently simi-
lar in characteristics to be treated together.
Morphology
Mesquite attains its maximum height of over 12 m
in sheltered riparian habitats, yet is opportunistic
enough to grow on exposed desert slopes where repro-
ductively mature individuals may only be 1.5 m tall. In
xeric upland sites, their taproot may reach only 1 m in
depth where solid bedrock prevents deeper penetra-
tion; however, taproots of P. velutina have been re-
corded at over 53 m depth (Philips 1963) under more
favorable conditions.
While mesquite trees are characterized by a massive
central taproot, they also possess an extensive lateral
root system (Heitschmidt and others 1988). For this
reason they are classified as facultative phreatophytes,
able to extract permanent ground water when avail-
able but also able to extract soil moisture (Ansley and
others 1990). Ansley and others (1990, 1991) severed
the lateral roots of four P. glandulosa var. glandulosa
trees at two sites in western Texas. They found that
stomatal conductance was reduced during the first
growing season on the site with less available sub-
surface water; this reduction disappeared during
the second growing season, probably due to root
regeneration.
In riparian habitats and desert grasslands, P. glan-
dulosa and P. velutina are typically single stemmed
with a central trunk up to 35 cm in diameter. However,
multistemmed individuals are not uncommon, espe-
cially as a result of resprouting following fire. Con-
versely, multistemmed plants are most common in
more arid habitats such as the Arizona upland re-
gions of the Sonoran Desert. Aboveground form also
appears to be related to subsurface characteristics.
For example, Stromberg and others (1993) compared
P. velutina aboveground characteristics to available
water and found that the height of stands in riparian
areas was inversely related to depth of the water table;
trees were 8 m tall where the ground water depth was
greater than 15 m, but grew to 12 m where the ground
water was less than 15 m.
Whether single or multistemmed, mesquite trees
produce branches that may form a canopy with a
diameter twice the height of the plant. Both stems and
larger branches may be either smooth or rough tex-
tured with a fair degree of individual variation.
Branches are typically spiny with considerable varia-
tion in thorn length (from 0.5 to over 5 cm) and density.
Finn and others (1994) identified annual growth
rings in the wood of P. glandulosa at five sites in
Texas. Their samples included trees that resprouted
vegetatively following cutting; for these plants they
noted that ring count would signify age of regrowth,
not necessarily the tree itself. They found stems rang-
ing from 7 to 30 years in age, but their data in con-
junction with Archer’s (1989) growth rate study suggest
that the age tree stems may exceed 200 years. Using
repeat photography, Bowers and others (1995) docu-
mented P. glandulosa longevities more than 100 years.
Phenology and Germination
Though climatic conditions vary considerably through-
out the ranges of P. glandulosa var. glandulosa and
P. velutina, their growing seasons are generally in the
spring and in the late summer. This is typical of a C3
species but not the C4 grass species that dominate
open rangelands. Mesquite trees are typically decidu-
ous during the winter months, but may also lose their
leaves during summer drought (Ansley and others
1992). Leaves produced during the spring may be
larger than in late summer (Nilsen 1986), perhaps in
response to light intensity and transpiration poten-
tial. These leaves form a hydrophobic waxy cuticle
that can accumulate during the growing season, pro-
viding mesquite some resistance to foliar-applied her-
bicides (Jacoby and others 1990c).
Flowering occurs in the late spring and typically
attracts a variety of flying insect-pollinators, includ-
ing bees, wasps, and beetles. Seed pods exceeding
30 cm in length are produced through the summer.
The seeds have a generally high mortality rate from
bruchid beetles (Algarobius prosopis and Neltumius
arizonensis), which bore holes into the fruit and de-
posit eggs on the seed. Germination occurs in both fall
and spring, coincident with peaks in annual precipita-
tion (Brown and Archer 1987).
The seeds have a hard exocarp and must undergo
scarification prior to germination. This contributes to
their long-term viability, which may exceed 20 years
(Martin 1948, 1970). Kramp and others (1998) evalu-
ated the effectiveness of deer, cattle, and coyotes as
scarification agents and vectors for P. glandulosa var.
glandulosa seed dispersal. They found that seeds
continued to germinate in fecal samples of all species
2 years after deposition, and that an average of 7.8,
5.2, and 4.5 seedlings emerged from deer, cattle, and
coyote feces, respectively. These authors concluded
that cattle were most effective as seed vectors because
cattle feces contained more seed. Brown and Archer

9
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-81. 2001
(1989) found that honey mesquite had a survival rate
of 74 to 97 percent for individuals that survived 2 weeks
after germination in cattle fecal sites. Ingestion by
herbivores has the added benefit of eliminating bruchid
beetles from the fruit (Burkhart 1976).
Under laboratory conditions, P. glandulosa seed-
lings in a clay loam soil emerged from planting depths
between 0.5 and 1.5 cm after 3 to 6 days, with a root-
to-shoot ratio of 5:1 within this period (Scifres and
Brock 1971). In a similar study of P. velutina seedlings,
Cox and others (1993) found that a planting depth of
2 to 4 cm in a sandy loam resulted in the highest
percent germination; they also determined that seeds
planted at this depth were unaffected by fire. Brock
(1986) found that unrestricted root growth is critical
for the survival of velvet mesquite seedlings. In a
laboratory study, he found that the greatest root
development and growth rate during the first 30 days
was in sandy loam and clay loam soils; after this time
aboveground growth exceeded root development.
Emerging seedlings readily survive losses of top
growth due to herbivory (Weltzin and others 1998). In
a growth chamber experiment, Weltzin and others
(1998) evaluated the relative tolerances of seedlings
aged 18 and 33 days to repeated clipping above either
the first or fourth nodes. They found that the younger
seedlings had a 75 percent survival rate after repeated
clipping above the first node, verses a 38 percent
survival rate for older seedlings.
Insufficient light may limit the survival of emerging
seedlings. Bush and Van Auken (1990) observed that
seedlings rarely emerge under the canopy of mature
P. glandulosa trees, despite elevated soil nutrient
concentrations. When these authors compared seed-
ling emergence and survival, they found that the
largest seedlings were found in areas with full light
and herbaceous plant exclusion, while the smallest
seedlings were found under adult trees with herba-
ceous plant competition. Conversely, Brown and Archer
(1989) found P. glandulosa seed germination and estab-
lishment to be independent of herbaceous biomass or
moisture conditions, though their survival rate in-
creased with supplemental watering.
Intraspecific competition can limit population den-
sities of either seedlings or reproductively mature
individuals. In a survey of establishment rates for
Prosopis glandulosa var. glandulosa in cattle fecal
sites in northern Texas, Kramp and others (1998)
found that all sites where mesquite had germinated
eventually had either a single established plant or
none. Ansley and others (1998) noted that access to
soil water appears to be the competitive mechanism
limiting population densities and individual tree size
for this species in areas where lateral root systems
provide the main source of water uptake.
Mesquite and Nitrogen
Nitrogen availability is considered to be a major
factor limiting plant growth in regions where mes-
quite occurs in the Southwestern United States (West
and Klemmedson 1978). However, several studies
have indicated that mesquite in these regions repre-
sent a source of nitrogen rather than a sink. In a 3-year
study, Barth and Klemmedson (1983) found that soil
under P. velutina canopies accumulated 11.2 g N/m2
per meter of tree height; this concentration was in-
versely related to distance from the trunk and de-
creased away from the canopy edge. Virginia and
Jarrell (1983) found similar results in a study of soil
properties under P. glandulosa var. glandulosa cano-
pies; total N, NH4
+, NO3
–, organic C, plant-available
P, and K were significantly (P ≤ 0.05) higher beneath
canopies than in adjacent open areas. In California,
Rundel and others (1982) found 1,020 g soil total N/m2
under Prosopis glandulosa var. torreyana canopies,
160 g soil total N/m2 total N between canopies, and
45 g soil total N/m2 in adjacent open areas. At the
Fort Huachuca Military Reservation in southeastern
Arizona, shallow soil under mesquite canopies had an
average of 17 mg NO3
–-N/kg and 2.05 mg/kg in adja-
cent open areas (Biggs 1997).
The main mechanism responsible for elevated soil
nutrient concentrations under mesquite is biological
nitrogen fixation by soil Rhizobia followed by litterfall.
In a symbiotic relationship, mesquite will transport
abundant C into their root systems at a high energy
cost to facilitate the establishment of Rhizobia bacte-
ria within the rhizosphere. Subsequently, the roots
form nodules around the Rhizobia which proceed to
convert N2 from the soil atmosphere to a form usable
by the host plant (NH3). Eventually this fixed atmo-
spheric N is returned to the soil via litterfall. Though
plants resorb leaf nutrients to varying degrees before
leaf senescence, fallen P. glandulosa leaves can con-
tain 2.6 percent N, a retention rate of over 74 percent
(Killingbeck and Whitford 1996). This represents an
annually renewed source of soil N which is replenished
mainly during the late fall when mesquite become
deciduous. Rundel and others (1982) have estimated
that 25 to 30 kg N/ha accumulates annually under
canopies of P. glandulosa var. torreyana as a result of
fixation, whereas Virginia (1986) found that mes-
quite litterfall annually returns 135 kg N/ha to the
soil. Since litter deposition occurs mainly under the
mesquite canopy, adjacent open areas may remain
unaffected.
Despite empirical evidence, explicit identification of
N fixation by mesquite has remained elusive. Shearer
and others (1983) found a lower isotope ratio of 15N/14N
in leaf tissue of P. glandulosa var. torreyana compared
to similar tissue of unrelated reference plants. This

10
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-81. 2001
indicated that mesquite were using atmospheric N,
which is naturally more abundant in 14N, rather than
mineralized soil N, which is more abundant in 15N.
However, these authors could not quantify the amount
of N fixed using this method, due to lack of replication
and the absence of appropriate non-N-fixing reference
plants.
Other researchers have attempted to locate N-fixing
nodules in the roots of mesquite. Johnson and Mayeux
(1990) recovered brown, leathery textured nodules in
the roots of P. glandulosa var. glandulosa in eastern
Texas. They found that 11 of 19 trees possessed nod-
ules within 10 cm of the soil surface; the average
length of each nodule was 1.7 mm. These nodules
increased in frequency with increasing depth below
the surface to their maximum sampling depth of 3 m.
The nodules were weakly attached to roots less than
0.5 mm in diameter. These authors also found abun-
dant insect frass and body parts in the vicinity of the
roots and suggested that nodule predation by insects
may have occurred. Virginia (1986) found that soil
Rhizobia populations increased with soil depth to a
maximum concentration at the upper margins of
ground water. Johnson and Mayeux (1990) suggest
that since soil NO3 can prevent N fixation, nodule
formation may occur in deeper soils with lower NO3
concentrations. Jenkins and others (1988, 1989) found
seasonally fluctuating populations of Rhizobia at 0 to
9 m depth in soil columns collected in playas, dunes,
arroyos, and grasslands in California and New Mexico.
Their data suggest that soil salinity, age of the host
plant, and ground water depth and fluctuations deter-
mine Rhizobia distribution and type. Presumably, the
location and density of nodulation in the mesquite root
zone correspond to these populations.
Considerable logistical difficulties must be over-
come for field identification of nodules, given their
fragility, small size, and the depths at which they are
found. Johnson and Mayeux (1990) failed to find nod-
ules under mesquite in western Texas, New Mexico,
and Arizona despite δ15N analysis that suggested
that these mesquite were utilizing atmospheric N.
These authors speculated that they may have simply
failed to locate the soil nodules since nodule formation
may be of an ephemeral nature, as has been suggested
by Bailey (1976) and Zitzer and others (1996).
Conversely, mesquite seedlings can form nodules
under controlled conditions. Bailey (1976) identified
root nodules produced by P. glandulosa seedlings
grown in a growth chamber. Frequency of nodulation
was statistically correlated with soil texture, water,
and the abundance of Rhizobia; wet sandy soils pro-
duced the most nodules, while dry clayey soils pro-
duced the least. Felker and Clark (1980) also found
nodules formed when both P. glandulosa varieties
were grown in vermiculite, furnished with a nutrient
solution free of N, and inoculated with soil Rhizobia
collected from the nodules of a mesquite grown in a
separate nodulation experiment (Eskew and Ting
1978).
Historical Range Expansion of
Mesquite_______________________
Much of the information on mesquite expansion in
the Southwestern United States comes from anecdotal
observations of ranchers and other rangeland users,
published reports, and repeat photography (figs. 2–6).
In one of the earliest scientific reports on the subject,
Griffiths (1910) reported his observations of increas-
ing mesquite populations on the Santa Rita Experi-
mental Range south of Tucson, AZ, and speculated
that overgrazing was one of the primary contributing
factors. Hastings and Turner (1965) present repeat
photography that documents increases in P. velutina
on southern Arizona rangelands. They found that
much of the increase in mesquite occurred after 1880.
A recent update of Hastings and Turner (1965) shows
that mesquite has also increased between the mid-
1960s and mid-1990s, indicating that the expansion
has not ceased (R.M. Turner, written communication,
1999).
Estimates of the rate of recent mesquite establish-
ment in open rangelands vary widely. Hennessy and
others (1983) determined that a black grama (Bouteloua
eriopoda) grassland on the Jornada Experimental Range
in southern New Mexico was completely converted to
mesquite woodland between 1934 and 1980. Gibbens
and others (1992) compared mesquite density on the
Jornada in herbicide-treated areas in 1976 and in
1988 and noted an increase from 67 to 494 plants/ha.
These authors also estimated that on the College
Ranch in New Mexico, P. glandulosa increased from
130 plants/ha in 1982 to 147 plants/ha in 1988. Using
data provided by Glendening (1952), Gibbens and
others (1992) estimated that P. velutina increased in
a 17-year period on the Santa Rita Experimental Range
at the rate of 9.2 plants/ha/year in areas with livestock
grazing, and at the rate of 15.7 plants/ha/year in areas
where livestock and rodents were excluded. Felker
and others (1990) noted that P. glandulosa stands can
regenerate to a density of 10,000 stems/ha, with an
average trunk diameter of 4 cm, 10 years after land
has been cleared. To predict future growth of P. velutina
stands, Chojnacky (1991) developed a model using
basal area, stems per stand, trees per stand, and
average tree height data from 47 locations in southern
Arizona. This model is mainly applicable to short-term
projections, since it does not account for mesquite
mortality. Using the model with a 30-year projection,
this author noted that initial basal area was probably

11
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-81. 2001
the most important variable influencing growth rate;
for a stand with an initial basal area of 18.5 m2/ha the
stand volume increased from approximately 62 to
80 m3/ha within 10 years, followed by a reduction to
the initial volume in the last 20 years. Implicit in this
model is the idea that mesquite stands that occur in
locations with abundant resources will experience a
rapid increase in size, then decline through intraspe-
cific competition.
Mechanisms of Mesquite Range
Expansion _____________________
Mesquite have the ability to access ground water
using a deep root system, grow in a variety of soil types
and in the variety of climatic conditions found in the
Southwestern United States, and can indirectly ac-
cess atmospheric N. Therefore, mesquite can avoid the
resource limitations that restrict the establishment
and maintenance of competing plants in the majority
of the habitats in which they are found. With this
relative independence, why have mesquite moved
into open grasslands from adjacent riparian or ephem-
eral channels only within the past century? While
much research has been focused on the mechanisms
of recent mesquite dispersal into open grasslands
(Archer and others 1988; Bahre 1985; Bahre and
Shelton 1993; Cox and others 1993; Grover and Musick
1990; Humphrey 1958; Reynolds and Glendening 1949;
Schlesinger and others 1990), little attention has
focused on why mesquite had not occupied these areas
prior to the past 150 years.
Fire
Mesquite range expansion has been attributed to
altered land-management practices associated with
cattle ranching (Bahre and Shelton 1993). Fires have
been actively suppressed during the past century to
minimize damage to vegetation, livestock, and prop-
erty; in addition, cattle grazing has reduced herba-
ceous fuel loads, thereby reducing fire frequency
(Van Auken and Bush 1997). Before widespread settle-
ment by Euro-Americans, Native Americans regu-
larly set wildfires in desert grasslands (Bahre 1985).
Over long periods, these fires presumably minimized
mesquite seedling establishment in open areas while
allowing the continued presence of mesquite in shel-
tered drainage and riparian areas. Now, occasional
fires occur with uncertain long-term effects (fig. 7).
Figure 7—June 1999. Effect of rangeland fire on Prosopis velutina woodland on
eastern foothills of the Huachuca Mountains, southeastern Arizona. Note the mesquite
tree (P. velutina) in the right foreground appears to be largely undamaged by fire
(photograph by Thomas Wilson).

At the Fort Huachuca Military Reservation, we
located three adjacent sites of different fire frequency
but equivalent topography and soil type (fig. 8). These
sites are separated by a network of roads that  function
as firebreaks. The site with less than one fire per
decade for the past 30 years had 4.75 kg/m2 of Pro-
sopis velutina aboveground biomass; the site with an
average of two fires per decade for this time period had
0.52 kg/m2; and the site with an average of four fires
per decade had 0.078 kg/m2 (Biggs 1997). The ratios of
P. velutina biomass to grass biomass were 116:1 on the
unburned site, 3:1 on the site with two fires per decade,
and 1:2 on the site with four fires per decade.
Seed Dispersal
Mechanisms of seed dispersal are likely to play a key
role in the dynamics of mesquite distribution (Brown
and Archer 1989). Janzen and Martin (1982) sug-
gested that mesquite thrived in open grasslands as
recently as 10,000 years ago. During the Pleistocene,
horses, elephants, and ground sloths served as the

these photos. The letters A, B, and C refer to plots intensively

nutrient concentrations and mesquite stand densities. (A) 1935.
Individual mesquite (P. velutina) are mostly confined to washes
at the upper right, center, and lower left. A prominent line from
upper right to middle left is a fence line, a residual of livestock
grazing in the area that ended in the early 1940s. Note that no
mesquite occur on sites A, B, and C. (B) November 17, 1956.
By 1956, mesquite trees are scattered throughout the view,
although large sections of grasslands remain without trees,
particularly at right. The modern road system, which also
serves as a firebreak system, was established just before this
time. The stand density of mesquite on sites A, B, and C is
approximately equal; all three sites had disturbances related to
World War II training exercises. (C) January 18, 1975. Mesquite

stands have become quite dense in some portions of the view, particularly at lower left. Mesquites have continued
to increase on site A, which did not burn in the 20th century. Site C burned shortly before this photograph, resulting
in its light color in this photograph, and mesquite trees are not very visible on this site in 1975. (D) January 20, 1985.
Mesquite stand densities are highest in 1985, particularly in the rangelands at left. Site C, which had a fire frequency
of four fires per decade between the early 1970s and 1989 (Biggs 1997), remains free of significant mesquite. In
the same period, site B had a fire frequency of two fires per decade, and mesquite trees are scattered uniformly
at a lower density than sites at lower left. Mesquite density on site A continued to increase because of lack of fires.
The difference between the burned sites and site A is reflected by differences in albedo. (E) March 31, 1994.
Because of wildfires set during military exercises, mesquite stand densities may be significantly lower on much of
the rangeland, particularly at lower left. However, the size of individual plants is much lower, reflecting resprouting
of trees damaged by fires. Because of the lack of fires, site A consequently has a high stand density and large size
of individual mesquite trees (Biggs and others 1999). For these reasons, site A clearly is distinguishable from sites
B and C as well as the rest of the rangeland. For these reasons, the Southern Gunnery Range at Fort Huachuca
serves as a good example of our management objective C, the limited control of mesquite on rangelands.

primary seed-dispersal agents, ingesting mesquite
fruit and subsequently depositing scarified seed at
fecal sites. Martin and Burney (1999) also suggest that
many of the characteristics of mesquite—sharp spines,
waxy leaves, sweet-tasting fruit, and the ability to
readily resprout following herbivory—evolved with
ancestral megafauna. This prevented overgrazing
while promoting fruit consumption and seed dispersal.
With the extinction of these large mammalian herbi-
vores, mesquite were found less frequently in open
areas but persisted in drainages and riparian areas,
where they were more resistant to environmental
perturbations such as drought or fire, and where their
seeds became dispersed through surface-water trans-
port (Grover and Musick 1990).
Adjacent drainages and riparian areas offer more
favorable growing conditions compared to open grass-
lands: improved moisture and nutrient availability
through surface-water transport, reduced maximum
air temperatures, and some protection from wind and
fire. However, mesquite are currently thriving on
open grasslands, and are providing an environment
favorable for the establishment of other woody shrubs
such as prickly pear cactus (Opuntia lindheimeri),
desert hackberry (Celtis pallida), hog plum (Colubrina
texensis) (Archer and others 1988), and perennial grasses
such as bush muhly (Muhlenbergia porteri) (Haque
and others 1991). Birds, rodents, and insects acting
as seed dispersal agents for shrub species may be
attracted to mesquite canopies for shade and reduced
visibility, incidentally transporting seed to the soil
below (Archer and others 1988). Consequently, the
shrubs germinating from these seeds might become
established because areas under mesquite canopies
provide most of the same resources and protection
from the elements as riparian areas.

Livestock Grazing
Cattle grazing is believed to be a major cause of the
contemporary range expansion of mesquite trees.
Through grazing, cattle limit herbaceous competition
for germinating mesquite seedlings, creating more
open areas with access to sunlight. Cattle ingest mes-
quite fruit, consequently transporting the seed, scari-
fying it, then depositing it in a moist, nutrient-rich
microenvironment. Brown and Archer (1987) com-
pared seedling emergence on sites with and without
cattle. They found 12 to 15 seedlings/m in the former
case and no seedlings in the latter. Brown and Archer
(1989) maintain that as seed dispersers, cattle are
surrogate megafauna, resuming relationship between
mesquite and large mammals that last existed in the
latest Pleistocene.
Cattle indirectly facilitate the establishment of
other shrubs under mesquite by augmenting soil nu-
trient concentrations. Cattle tend to congregate under
the shade of mesquite trees, where they deposit abun-
dant feces, providing supplemental N to the soil that
adds to the elevated N concentrations that result from
litterfall. Livestock therefore contribute to the redistri-
bution of nutrients from open rangelands to beneath
mesquite canopies.
Livestock grazing facilitates mesquite establishment
in open grassland ranges but reduces the biomass of
native grasses by at least three mechanisms. First, as
mesquite woodlands comprise a larger portion of the
aboveground biomass within an area, the grazing
intensity on the remaining grasses increases because
shrubs and trees are less palatable than grasses (Grover
and Musick 1990). Second, mesquite woodlands can
form a canopy that inhibits native grass seed germi-
nation as suitable microclimates become more spa-
tially restricted. Third, mesquite trees sequester
nutrients, making intertree areas relatively nutrient
poor (Biggs 1997).
Eventually, mesquite growth may inhibit grazing.
Archer and others (1988) used aerial photographs
taken in 1941, 1960, and 1983 to monitor closed-
canopy woodlands and woody plant groupings cen-
tered around P. glandulosa within grasslands on the
Rio Grande Plains of Texas. Within the grassland,
they found that half of the groupings were less than
5 m apart and 95 percent were within 15 m. These
authors predicted that these gaps would diminish as
individual canopies grew because the mean area for
each grouping increased from 494 m2 to 717 m2 (+70
percent) between 1941 and 1983. Seedlings, composed
mainly of P. glandulosa, occupied 85 percent of the
open areas (Archer and others 1988). Eventually these
trees can form an impenetrable thicket, restricting
livestock traffic and increasing the cost of livestock
management (Teague and others 1997).
Mesquite stands may continue to increase in size on
open ranges after cattle grazing has been eliminated
(Brown 1950; Brown and Archer 1989; Glendening
1952). Once seed has been dispersed into open areas
and mesquites have become established, a constantly
renewed seed bank and seed viability that can last for
20 years (Martin 1970) ensure that mesquite could
persist on open rangelands. For example, at the Fort
Huachuca Military Reservation in southeastern Ari-
zona, cattle grazing has been eliminated since the
mid-1940s. However, aerial photographs of the region
from 1935 to 1994 document the continued increase of
mesquite in open rangeland 50 years after cattle
grazing was terminated, despite periodic grassland
fires that appear to affect average canopy size (fig. 8).
While maximum stand densities continue to exist
within riparian areas, populations of established trees
and seedlings in grasslands persist to form woodlands
of greater than 80 trees/ha at Fort Huachuca (Wilson
2001).
Climate Fluctuations and Atmospheric
Gases
An increase in the relative contribution of winter
rains to annual precipitation can favor the germina-
tion and establishment of certain shrub species, in-
cluding mesquite (Sala and others 1997). Mesquite
and many common shrubs in the Southwestern United
States have a C3 photosynthetic pathway, deciduous
habit, a moderate transpiration rate, drought avoid-
ance, low herbivory, high seed production, many ger-
mination requirements, high survival following dis-
turbance, and slow recruitment (Diaz and Cabido
1997). Grasses in this region are C4 plants with a high
leaf area, a shallow dense fine root system, a high
transpiration rate, low to moderate drought resis-
tance, moderate herbivory, moderate seed production,
few germination requirements, and low survival after
disturbance but rapid reestablishment. Changes in
the seasonal pattern of soil-water potential is reflected
in the relative abundance of C3 shrubs verses C4
grasslands in a region (Sala and others 1997). Shrubs
favor winter precipitation for seed germination and
vegetative growth, while grasses are more responsive
to warm-season rainfall, suggesting that changes in
seasonal precipitation may drive rangeland conver-
sions from grasses to shrubs.
Changes in climate in the Southwestern United
States during the 20th century have been docu-
mented (Hastings and Turner 1965) and disputed
(Bahre 1991). To evaluate climatic variation in south-
western New Mexico and southeastern Arizona, we
standardized seasonal precipitation using the tech-
nique of Hereford and Webb (1992). We identified
the two ecological precipitation seasons of summer

15
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-81. 2001
(July through September) and winter (November
through March). For winter precipitation, Novem-
ber and December totals were considered part of the
following year. For each climate station that we
used (tables 1–2), we calculated the standardized
seasonal precipitation, Ps, by
Ps = ∑{∑[(xij – µi)/σi]/k}/n,
(1)
where xi,j = monthly precipitation for climate station i
in month j (mm); µi = the mean and σi = the standard
deviation of monthly precipitation for climate station
i (mm); k = the number of months in the season; and
n = the number of climate stations with data. The
value of n varies through the 20th century due to the
varying number of available climate stations (for
example, tables 1–2) and whether or not data are
missing.
Annual and seasonal precipitation in southwestern
New Mexico and southeastern Arizona has varied dur-
ing the 20th century (figs. 9–11). From 1980 through
1998, 15 and 12 years had above-average annual
precipitation in southwestern New Mexico and south-
eastern Arizona, respectively (fig. 9). Annual precipi-
tation from about 1940 to 1980 was generally below
average, particularly in the mid-1950s. The results
displayed in figure 9 confirm previous work that sug-
gests that annual precipitation in the Southwestern
United States is nonstationary (Hereford and Webb
1992; Webb and Betancourt 1992).
Seasonal precipitation also varies between years. In
southwestern New Mexico and southeastern Arizona,
12 years had above-average winter precipitation be-
tween 1980 and 1998, compared to 12 years of above-
average winter precipitation during the previous 40
years (figs. 10–11). Between 1900 and 1998 in south-
eastern Arizona, winter or summer precipitation (but
not both) was above average for 51 years; of these, 28
years had above-average winter precipitation with
below-average summer precipitation. The period from
1895 to 1906 included only 3 years of above-average
precipitation, and those only occurred during the sum-
mer (fig. 11A). However, 10 of the following 11 years
had above-average winter precipitation, coinciding
with the range expansion of mesquite observed by
Griffiths (1910). These weather patterns may have
significantly contributed to this expansion by optimiz-
ing environmental conditions for enhanced mesquite
seed germination. More recent increases in winter
precipitation could be manifested in an accelerated
rate of mesquite establishment during the past 20
years as observed by ranchers in the Southwestern
United States.
The 27 percent increase in atmospheric CO2 from
1900 to the present has been cited as a contributing

factor in mesquite range expansion. Polley and others
(1994) observed increased nodulation and N fixation
when greenhouse-grown P. glandulosa seedlings were
exposed to elevated CO2 concentrations. These seed-
lings also produced more belowground biomass, and
their N and water-use efficiencies increased linearly
with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Con-
versely, mesquite seedlings grown with little bluestem
(Schizachyrium scoparium), a C4 perennial grass,
manifested none of these characteristics. The authors
suggest competition with grasses attenuates the ben-
eficial effects of increased atmospheric CO2 on mes-
quite. In the absence of this competition, mesquite
seedlings can establish more rapidly.
Mesquite Management
Practices ______________________
Because of mesquite expansion into open range-
lands, with resulting reductions in livestock forage,
land-use managers have employed a variety of tac-
tics—fire, herbicide, and physical removal—to com-
pletely remove existing trees and limit further spread.
These practices all have something in common: logis-
tical difficulties and side effects potentially harmful to
habitat restoration. For example, ranchers at the
Waggoner Ranch (202,000 ha) in northern Texas
have attempted to remove mesquite since the 1950s
without effect, and it continues to regenerate in
treated areas and spread further. Attempts at control
have been largely terminated due to increasing costs
(Teague and others 1997).
Prescribed Burning
Fire has been used as a management tool to control
mesquite distribution for decades (Humphrey 1949).
However, mesquite trees can survive fire while still
relatively young. Wright and others (1976) determined
that while P. glandulosa seedlings up to 1.5 years of
age were easy to kill with medium intensity fires,
2.5-year-old trees survived with severe damage, and
3.5-year-old trees were tolerant; these authors recom-
mended against using fire as a management tool in
overgrazed areas. Archer and others (1988) found
similar results. Martin (1983) determined that within
5 years of a fire in southern Arizona P. velutina
biomass had attained preburn levels. In these cases
cattle grazing could increase mesquite survival rates
by not only lowering fire frequency through fuel re-
moval (Van Auken and Bush 1997), but fire intensity
as well. Hobbs and others (1991) found that grazing
reduced fire temperature and energy release in a
tallgrass prairie.
Livestock grazing alters rangeland fire characteris-
tics in the following ways. Consumption and tram-
pling by livestock can lower the density and average
height of herbaceous biomass. In turn, this can affect
the average height and duration of a fire; in many
cases, flames may not reach the canopies of reproduc-
tively mature mesquite. After a fire, mesquite below a
certain size class can be reduced in numbers; however,
given the survival rate of larger reproductively ma-
ture trees, recruitment would continue as the larger
trees replenish the mesquite seed bank.
Since mesquite trees appear largely impervious to
individual fires, repeated burning has been recom-
mended (Wright and others 1976). In this case, the
fires would need to occur at a frequency that would
prevent the recovery from damage inflicted by previ-
ous fires, and it assumes that sufficient fuel would
accumulate in the periods between fires. While this
might provide an effective management tool to limit
the distribution of mesquite of certain size classes, it
could also provide the conditions that  facilitate the
establishment of exotic plant species better adapted

than native grass species to cope with frequent distur-
bance, such as Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis
lehmanniana) (Martin 1983; Wilson and others 1999).
This is an important point to consider when attempt-
ing to restore desert grasslands to historic species
compositions.
Herbicide Application
Herbicides have also been employed to control the
spread of mesquite. In a 3-year study, aircraft applied
1.12 kg/ha of 3,6-dichloropicolinic acid (clopyralid)
(Jacoby and others 1981). Subsequent monitoring
over a 2-year period showed that this agent was
significantly more effective at killing mesquite than
2,4,5-T and picloram applied at the same rate, with
60 to 68 percent mortality. Jacoby and others (1981)
observed that clopyralid was not effective in killing
associated shrub and succulent plants such as salt-
bush (Atriplex sp.) or prickly pear (Opuntia sp.). In
another study, Jacoby and others (1982) determined
that dead mesquite serves to protect germinating
forage plants from grazing, allowing significant in-
creases in forage production.
Subsequent studies have attempted to quantify the
effects of herbicide treatment based upon mesquite
morphology. Jacoby and others (1990b) determined
that mesquite with multiple stems were significantly
more resistant to mortality from a variety of herbi-
cides including clopyralid, triclopyr, picloram, and
2,4,5-T. Though they determined that clopyralid was
the most effective herbicide, mortality decreased from
55 percent for single-stemmed trees, 35 percent for
three- to five-stemmed trees, and 19 percent for trees
with greater than five stems. These authors suggest
that the greater canopy coverage for multiple-stemmed
trees is more effective in preventing herbicides from
penetrating the soil under the canopies. In contrast,
they did not find a significant relationship between
tree height and herbicide-induced mortality (Jacoby
and others 1990a).
The epicuticular wax found on mesquite leaves can
minimize the effects of foliage-absorbed herbicides.
Mayeux and Wilkinson (1990) suggest that herbicides
applied in an oil spray are more effective than aqueous
sprays. Jacoby and others (1990c) found that leaf
epicuticular wax increased through the growing sea-
son, then stabilized or decreased in late summer.
These authors also found individual differences in the
amount of leaf epicuticular wax within populations
and suggest that over time these trees could represent
a greater portion of the population as the selective
pressure of foliage-absorbed herbicide applications
eliminated trees with less leaf epicuticular wax.
Jacoby and Ansley (1991) evaluated the effects of
herbicide applications during various seasons. They
found the most effective herbicide—clopyralid—in-
duced the greatest mortality (92 percent) when ap-
plied during September. These authors suggested that
herbicide applications during the late summer are
most effective, and nearby agricultural areas are less
susceptible to treatment effects at that time.
One negative effect of herbicide treatment is the
potentially deleterious effects on the environment and
biodiversity within open rangeland. Nolte and
Fulbright (1997) monitored plant and animal biomass
for 2 years following treatment of mesquite with a
mixture of picloram and triclopyr. They found no
differences in vegetation, rodent, and avian species
richness between control plots and treatment areas,
although they noted that annual precipitation was 16
percent above average during this period, possibly
attenuating the deleterious effects of the herbicide.
This study and the ones previously mentioned (Jacoby
and others 1981, 1982, 1990a,b,c, 1991) were con-
ducted within a 10-year period or less, and only moni-
tored the effects of a single herbicide application. To
completely remove mesquite or at least limit its spread
in open rangeland using herbicides only, multiple
treatments are required; otherwise, the long-term
viability of mesquite seeds and their abundance within
the seed bank would ensure continual recruitment.
These multiple applications could create adverse
side effects to rangeland species diversity and biomass
not recognized from the results of a single treatment.
In a study that evaluated impacts of repeated herbi-
cide applications on biodiversity, Gibbens and others
(1986) applied 2,4,5-T to Prosopis glandulosa within
dunelands in southern New Mexico during 3 consecu-
tive years. They found mesquite mortality to be 54
percent, without specifying if any specific age class of
mesquite were particularly susceptible. These au-
thors also determined that residual 2,4,5-T in the soil
dissipated rapidly, and was not detected 131 days
after treatment. While they found lower indices of
microbial activity on treated areas, they attributed
this to lower carbon availability as the mesquite trees
were defoliated. Overall, the authors found a decrease
in avian species diversity on treated areas but no
differences in arthropod or rodent diversity. Since this
was a 3-year study, no data were presented on the rate
of mesquite recruitment following the herbicide treat-
ment. Although these results appear promising, mes-
quite mortality after 3 consecutive years of herbicide
applications accounted for just over half of the trees in
the study area. This implies that these treatments
would have to continue at a fairly regular interval for
many years to create a significant long-term reduction
in mesquite populations. With the attendant costs of
herbicides and aerial application over large areas, a
viable long-term management strategy using only
herbicides may be impractical.

Mechanical Removal
Mesquite physical removal is another management
tactic. Roller chopping and shredding can reduce plant
density, stature, and canopy cover immediately fol-
lowing treatment, but subsequent basal resprouting
can create greater stem densities (Dodd and Holtz
1971). Other techniques include root plowing, chain-
ing, and dozing. While these tactics may kill existing
mesquite, the woody debris is often left in place,
therefore impeding navigation through these areas
and limiting available space for livestock forage
(McPherson and Wright 1986). In addition, mechani-
cal removal may negatively affect other plant and
animal species. For example, driving large mechanical
equipment through rangeland can cause soil compac-
tion, crush animals, destroy animal burrows, and
uproot desirable plant species such as perennial
grasses. The extent of these effects remains unknown.
Mesquite Management
Objectives _____________________
This paper has mainly discussed the negative im-
pacts of mesquite population expansion onto open
rangeland. However, mesquite wood is prized as a
material for furniture, and the wood is also used for
cooking, with an estimated value of $400/ton as
barbeque chips (Felker 1996). Some characteristics of
the wood, such as hardness and shrinkage, are consid-
ered equivalent or superior to mahogany, oak, and
walnut (Felker and others 1990), with lower rates of
expansion and contraction due to changes in ambient
humidity. While still nascent, the mesquite lumber
industry in Texas generates $5 to 10 million per year
(Felker 1996).
Mesquite seed pods are high in carbohydrates, pro-
viding a rich energy source for wildlife, livestock, and
humans (Felker 1998). Mesquite trees also provide
habitat for birds, small mammals, reptiles, and in-
sects, increasing biodiversity and recreational oppor-
tunities (McPherson 1997). Therefore, completely re-
moving mesquite trees from open rangeland may not
only be an unrealistic objective, it may actually lower
the profitability of this rangeland to land-use manag-
ers. For this reason, management objectives and their
implications should be clearly articulated when for-
mulating a management strategy.
For example, if the management objective is the
complete removal of mesquite trees from open range-
land, the long-term commitment of resources to this
task might not be a realistic goal for many land-use
managers. Instead, a compromise may have to be
reached, whereby the density of mesquite stands are
reduced to the point that land-use activities such as
cattle ranching may be efficiently practiced, while
recognizing that these trees will continue to exist on
open rangeland. Periodic burning of this open range-
land may therefore not entirely remove mesquite, but
will lower its density to the point that cattle may find
sufficient forage, and ranchers may avoid navigating
within dense woodland. Overall, land-use managers
have a choice of three management objectives. They
are described as follows, with the specific procedure or
combination of procedures that may be most effective.
Objective 1: Complete Mesquite Removal
From Desert Grassland
This option is considered by those who wish to
restore desert grasslands to their historic (within the
past 150 years) species compositions. To completely
remove mesquite trees, two points need consideration.
First, one has to consider the prodigious commitment
of resources in terms of personnel, materials, time,
and expense. Second, complete removal of mesquite
does not necessarily result in the restoration of desert
grassland. If mesquite range expansion represents a
form of disturbance to the grassland plant community,
then efforts to remove it represent another. Exotic
plant species better adapted to various disturbance
regimes may have a competitive advantage over na-
tive grasses in exploiting this disturbance. For this
reason, a management strategy would have to include
continual monitoring and persistent removal of mes-
quite and other undesirable plant species. Where
possible, documentation of the rate and extent of
mesquite spread in the management area could help
determine the extent of management efforts neces-
sary for removal. This documentation would include
dated aerial photographs and interviews with local
residents.
A suggested management tactic is a combination of
mechanical removal and/or herbicide treatment fol-
lowed by prescribed burning. If prescribed burning is
scheduled after allowing the mechanically displaced
woody debris to dry sufficiently for combustion, then
this may allow the surviving mesquite to resprout.
These resprouts could then be killed back by the
subsequent fire. McPherson and Wright (1986) recom-
mended that areas to be burned should be suspended
from livestock grazing for at least a previous growing
season so that herbaceous dry matter could accumu-
late. They also recommended conducting a small test
burn to verify the efficacy of a prescribed burn within
a given time period. Over time, periodic prescribed
fires could be used to destroy emerging mesquite
seedlings. The rate of mesquite reestablishment in
this area would depend on the size of the existing seed
bank, the density and distribution of mesquite stands
in adjacent areas, and the mechanisms of seed dis-
persal from those adjacent areas.

20
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-81. 2001
To satisfy this objective, land-use managers could
identify and protect rangelands that are currently
devoid of mesquite, such as the desert grassland north
of Sonata in southeastern Arizona (fig. 1). Since the
seed bank in these areas would be largely devoid of
mesquite, potential seed dispersers would have to be
monitored and controlled. Due to the high rate of mes-
quite establishment in rangelands, these mesquite-free
areas are becoming more limited in size. Preventing
mesquite establishment is less difficult than removing
it, though this may be unrealistic in areas that contain
livestock.
Objective 2: Continued Mesquite
Establishment in Desert Grassland
This objective may be implemented by ranchers who
lack the resources necessary for range control or by
researchers who wish to study the current and future
rate and extent of mesquite establishment on open
rangelands. Because the N-fixing capability of mes-
quite can elevate soil N concentrations within the
rangeland, exotic plants that have higher N require-
ments could become established. Even a management
objective of nonintervention would have to include
continued monitoring of rangeland for potentially in-
vasive species.
The implementation of any of the other manage-
ment objectives will become more difficult with time as
the mesquite alter soil-nutrient concentrations and
create a long-lasting seed bank. Therefore, a long-
range forecast of land use in these rangelands is
advisable before implementing this objective.
Objective 3: Limited Mesquite Removal
From Desert Grassland
This objective is probably the most feasible alterna-
tive for most land-use managers, including those who
have limited resources for rangeland control, and/or
those who wish to profit from the beneficial aspects of
limited mesquite establishment on rangeland. Pre-
scribed fires combined with limited grazing and an
initial herbicide application are recommended man-
agement tactics in this case. Ansley and others (1996)
determined that while intense fires may kill all
aboveground portions of mesquite, basal resprouting
may quickly produce an impenetrable grove. These
authors suggested that lower intensity fires may kill
small mesquite while allowing larger individuals to
survive with intact upper canopies; this can create a
park effect with enhanced visibility beneath stand
canopies. Since the main stems of the larger mesquite
remain intact, resprouting would be minimized.
By minimizing multistemmed resprouting, the av-
erage stem diameter of mesquite stands would be
larger, increasing the commercial lumber value.
Ansley and others (1998) thinned sections of a dense
mesquite woodland from 300 to 80 trees/ha; within
5 years of thinning, trees within this section had
significantly greater basal stem diameters, canopy
diameters, and leaf area. Felker and others (1990)
have suggested that limited removal of mesquite from
rangeland may actually increase its value as lumber,
as stands below maximum density tend to produce
larger individuals with thicker main stems. They
predicted that a spacing of 10 m per tree would pro-
duce an optimum yield. Limited grazing intensity
would slow the rate of mesquite seed establishment
and would also allow grasses to retain viable popula-
tions between mesquite canopies.
The parklike stands resulting from periodic pre-
scribed fires would become more aesthetically appeal-
ing, creating opportunities for recreation and tourism
while maintaining an increased biodiversity of wild-
life. Ultimately, this land management system could
increase the commercial value of rangeland for ranch-
ers; commercial utilization of these areas for mesquite
lumber and tourism and recreation would offset any
losses in revenue from limited livestock grazing. Since
this management tactic is relatively inexpensive to
implement (Teague and others 1997), it can be used
over a long period to ensure that these thinned mes-
quite stands remain stable in density.
Conclusions____________________
After Euro-American settlement in rangelands of
the Southwestern United States, mesquite moved
from predominantly riparian and ephemeral-channel
locations to adjacent xeric grasslands. The exact causes
for this range expansion are complex and may never be
fully determined. Although mesquite is native to the
geographic region, its expansion into more xeric habi-
tats resembles that of exotic invasive species, and
warrants an inspection of its life history strategies, as
discussed in this paper.
Although many plant species lack common features
that determine whether they are invasive or poten-
tially invasive, mesquite is uniquely qualified to oc-
cupy areas that are resource-limited to many other C3
plants. As C3 plants, they can utilize winter precipita-
tion that is unused by C4 grasses, and their deep root
system ensures that they have access to soil moisture
unavailable to shallow-rooted grasses. Mesquite can
indirectly access atmospheric N, a resource that is
severely limited in xeric environments.
Two interdependent factors may account for in-
creased mesquite distribution in open rangelands
within the last 150 years. Seed dispersal has increased
due to ingestion by livestock, and to a lesser extent by
rodents. Germination and establishment of seeds has

21
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-81. 2001
been enhanced by increases in winter precipitation,
particularly since about 1960, and decreases in inter-
specific competition due to livestock grazing. Ulti-
mately, mesquite stands may increase until mes-
quites are only competing with each other for resources.
In the absence of a land-management strategy, in-
traspecific competition may be the main mechanism
limiting their densities in this habitat.
It is ironic that livestock grazing is one of the main
dispersal mechanisms for seed, while at the same time
increasing mesquite stand densities limits future graz-
ing potential of this region. For continued use of these
areas for livestock grazing, a land-management strat-
egy is therefore mandated. This strategy must contain
clearly defined objectives after determining how these
areas will be used.
Of the three management objectives offered, com-
plete removal of mesquite from open rangelands would
be the most difficult to accomplish and to maintain. In
contrast, nonintervention would be the easiest to imple-
ment. However, this could have undesirable conse-
quences as exotic plant species may become estab-
lished, and the biodiversity of native plants become
diminished. Limited removal of mesquite from these
rangelands is potentially the most realistic objective
for most land use managers, as it may be relatively
cheap to implement (Teague and others 1997), while
actually increasing the commercial potential of this
landscape.

The Rocky Mountain Research Station develops scientific informa-
tion and technology to improve management, protection, and use of
the forests and rangelands. Research is designed to meet the needs
of National Forest managers, Federal and State agencies, public and
private organizations, academic institutions, industry, and individuals.
Studies accelerate solutions to problems involving ecosystems,
range, forests, water, recreation, fire, resource inventory, land recla-
mation, community sustainability, forest engineering technology,
multiple use economics, wildlife and fish habitat, and forest insects
and diseases. Studies are conducted cooperatively, and applications
may be found worldwide.
