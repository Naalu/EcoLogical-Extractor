Highlight 
What 
is there 
about pinyon 
and 
juniper frees which reduces growth 
of blue grama ? 
This study 
shows 
fhaf the chief 
influence 
is due to 
free litier, nof canopy.

University. 
Pinyon 
(Pinus 
spp.) and juni- 
per 
(Juniperus 
spp.) 
woodlands 
cover 
millions 
of acres 
in the 
semiarid 
Southwest. 
These trees 
have 
increased 
in recent 
years 
(Johnsen, 
1962)) and the increase 
has been associated 
with declin- 
ing forage 
production 
(Arnold, 
Jameson, 
and Reid, 
1964). 
Trees 
have 
been 
controlled 
on many 
acres of rangelands 
in an attempt 
to restore 
the forage 
production. 
Although 
the reduction 
of grass 
cover 
with 
increasing 
trees 
has 
been reported, 
the nature 
of the 
effect 
of the trees on grasses 
has 
not been carefully 
studied. Trees 
can 
conceivably 
influence 
the 
understory 
grasses 
by (1) com- 
petition 
for 
water, 
(2) 
shade, 
(3) 
rainfall 
interception, 
(4) 
litter, 
and 
(5) 
phytotoxic 
root 
exudates. 
The influence 
of these 
factors 
may well be different 
for 
various 
grass species. 
This study 
reports 
results 
on part 
of the 
overall 
problem, 
that is, the in- 
fluence 
of tree 
litter 
and 
tree 
cover on blue grama 
(Bouteloua 
gracilis, 
(H.B.K.) 
Lag.) . 
Review 
of Liierafure 
Arnold 
et al. (1964) reported that 
pinyon 
and juniper 
trees reduced 
basal intercept of blue grama on sev- 
eral widely spaced plots in northern 
Arizona. 
Basal 
intercept 
of 
blue 
grama averaged 2.36% with no tree 
cover 
and 
0.34% 
with 
85% 
tree 

PINYON-JUNIPER 
LITTER 
215 
cover. 
Intermediate 
degrees 
of tree 
cover had intermediate 
blue 
grama 
basal 
intercepts. 
Arnold 
(1964) 
showed that the influence 
of one-seed 
juniper 
(J. monosperma 
(Engelm.) 
Sarg.) 
trees on blue grama is large- 
ly localized 
under 
the crown. 
Blue 
grama 
basal 
intercept 
at different 
locations 
was: Under 
the middle 
of 
the tree, 
0.0; under 
outer 
parts 
of 
the tree, 0.62; from canopy 
edge to 
17 ft beyond 
the canopy, 
1.48; more 
than 
II ft beyond 
the canopy, 
1.38. 
Johnsen 
(1962) found 
that roots of 
a juniper 
tree 
9.5 ft tall 
extended 
2.5 to 3 times as far as the tree was 
tall. Blue grama 
roots in Johnsen’s 
study 
weighed 
0.9 g per 
0.25 ft3 
of soil at the edge of the juniper 
canopy, 8.8 g 5 ft beyond 
the canopy 
edge, 
and 
13.1 g 25 ft from 
the 
canopy 
edge and beyond. 
Tree canopies 
influence 
light 
and 
rainfall 
interception. 
Skau 
(1960) 
found 
that 
juniper 
trees 
intercept 
about 
40% of the precipitation 
that 
falls on the crown. 
A small portion 
of the 
intercepted 
rainfall 
is re- 
covered 
as stem flow, and in some 
storms 
this may provide 
additional 
moisture 
near 
the base of the tree 
(Johnsen, 
1962). 
Blue 
grama 
is sensitive 
to heavy 
shade (Benedict, 
1941; Johnsen, 
1962) 
and a juniper 
tree can intercept 
up 
to 80% of the direct 
sunlight. 
Re- 
flected 
light, 
however, 
can greatly 
augment 
the total radiation 
received 
under the tree canopy. Shirley 
(1945) 
reviewed 
the effect of light competi- 
tion 
on plants, 
and concluded 
that 
juniper 
and pinyon 
trees rarely 
cast 
enough 
shadow 
to cause 
any harm 
to understory 
vegetation. 
Tree litter is, of course, associated 
with tree cover, but can have its own 
independent 
effect on grass growth. 
For example, 
Jameson 
(1961) found 
that 
water 
extracts 
of pinyon 
and 
juniper 
foliage 
reduced 
growth 
of 
wheat 
radicles 
as 
follows: 
Utah 
juniper 
(J. 
osteosperma 
(Tom.) 
Little) 
85%; 
alligator 
juniper 
(J. 
deppeana 
Steud.) 
83%; 
one-seed 
juniper 
79%, 
and 
pinyon 
(Pinus 
edulis 
Engelm.) 
67%. 
Similar 
re- 
ductions 
have 
also been 
found 
in 
the growth 
of blue 
grama 
radicles 
(U. S. Forest Service, 
1963). 
Study 
Areas and Measuremenfs 
The study 
areas 
included 
two l- 
acre plots about 
35 miles 
northwest 
of Flagstaff, 
Arizona, 
and one l-acre 
plot about 
30 miles 
south of Selig- 
man, 
Arizona. 
Both 
areas 
have 
a 
divided 
winter-summer 
rainfall 
pat- 
tern, 
and 
blue 
grama 
grows 
pri- 
marily 
during 
the 
summer 
rainy 
period. 
The plots were suitable 
for 
the analysis 
presented 
here because 
the understory 
vegetation 
was most- 
ly blue grama (Fig. 1). The location, 
soils, and rainfall 
of the various plots 
are described 
in Table 1. The basaltic 
soil became 
a clay below 2 inches; 
the other soils retained 
their surface 
texture 
throughout 
the profile. 
The 
tree 
stands 
were 
made 
up 
mostly 
of mature 
and 
overmature 
trees. Tree cover ranged 
from 
13% 
an the granitic 
soil to 31% on the 
limestone 
soil. The contribution 
of 
blue grama 
to total herbage 
weight 
ranged 
from 
76% on the limestone 
soil to 89% on the granitic 
soil, 
At each 
plot, 
50 subplots 
were 
selected 
at random. 
Three measure- 
ments were taken at each subplot: 
(1) Tree cover was sampled 
with a 
spherical 
densiometer 
(Lemmon, 
1956). This device provides 
means of 
estimating 
the canopy intercept 
in an 
inverted 
cone 
over 
the 
subplots. 
Where 
more 
than 
one tree 
species 
occurred, 
the 
proportion 
of cover 
made 
up by each 
species 
on each 
subplot 
was estimated. 
(2) Litter, 
rock, and basal area of 
plants 
were 
sampled 
with 
a point 
frame. A 1x1 m frame with 50 points 
spaced 
1x2 dm was used. 
(3) Weight 
of herbaceous 
vegeta- 
tion was estimated. 
One-fifth 
of the 
subplots 
were clipped 
to provide 
a 
conversion 
factor of estimated 
fresh 
weight to actual dry weight.

JAMESON 
Analysis of Data 
Multiple 
regression 
techniques 
outlined 
by Goulden 
(1952) were 
used to analyze 
the data. 
By this 
approach, 
the influence 
of each 
factor 
could 
be separated 
from 
the 
influence 
of other 
factors. 
All attributes 
measured 
were in- 
cluded 
in the analyses 
of data 
from the basaltic 
and limestone 
soils. 
On the granitic 
soil plot, 
rocks 
and other 
plants 
were 
so 
infrequent 
that the few subplots 
which 
did contain 
these 
attri- 
butes 
were 
simply 
eliminated 
from the calculations. 
Both basal 
area 
and weight 
of blue 
grama 
were 
used 
as 
dependent 
vari- 
ables 
on the 
basaltic 
soil 
and 
limestone 
soil 
plots. 
On 
the 
granitic 
soil plot, 
many 
annual 
weeds 
were 
present 
when 
the 
weight 
estimates 
were 
taken. 
These 
weeds 
may 
have 
influ- 
enced the growth 
of blue grama, 
so the weight 
figures 
were 
not 
used. 
In all cases, litter was the most 
important 
factor 
influencing 
blue grama. 
The partial 
regres- 
sion 
c’oefficients, 
which 
were 
similar 
for data from 
all plots, 
ranged 
from 
-0.042 
to -0.058 
when 
the dependent 
variable 
was basal area and -0.33 to -0.36 
when 
the 
dependent 
variable 
was weight. 
The effect 
of litter 
was statistically 
significant 
in all 
cases. 
On the basaltic 
soil plot, 
the 
regression 
coefficients 
did 
not change 
greatly 
when 
litter 
was the only independent 
vari- 
able 
used. 
On the other 
plots, 
the use of litter 
alone 
as an in- 
dependent 
variable 
resulted 
in 
nonsignificant 
regressions. 
Tree cover, whether 
pinyon or 
juniper, 
was 
not 
significantly 
related 
to blue 
grama 
in 
any 
case. 
In 6 of 9 cases, 
however, 
the sign of the regression 
coef- 
ficient 
for tree 
cover 
was posi- 
tive. 
On the granitic 
soil plot, 
the effect 
of juniper 
cover 
ap- 
proached 
significance 
and 
the 
sign was positive. 
These positive 
coefficients 
indicate 
it is unlikely 
that tree cover had a real nega- 
tive 
effect 
on blue 
grama. 
In- 
cluding 
tree cover in the regres- 
sion 
calculation 
greatly 
im- 
proved 
the fit in both the lime- 
stone soil and granitic 
soil data. 
Since 
litter 
was the chief fac- 
tor related 
to a decrease 
of blue 
grama, 
the contribution 
of pin- 
yon cover 
and juniper 
cover 
to 
total 
tree 
litter 
on the basaltic 
soil plot was determined. 
Both 
of the tree 
species 
contributed 
about the same to total tree lit- 
ter; 
the 
regression 
coefficient 
was 0.64 for pinyon 
and 0.68 for 
juniper. 
In multiple 
regression 
analy- 
sis, a strong correlation 
between 
independent 
variables 
can lead 
to misleading 
and 
inconsistent 
regression 
coefficients 
between 
the 
independent 
variables 
and 
the dependent 
variables. 
In this 
case, however, 
both the sign and 
value 
of the 
regression 
coeffi- 
cients 
were 
similar 
under 
a va- 
riety of circumstances, 
which in- 
dicates 
that 
the 
regression 
co- 
efficients 
express 
a real effect. 
Relationship 
fo Other Studies 
and Management 
Problems 
These 
calculations 
show 
that 
pinyon 
and juniper 
litter 
is as- 
sociated 
with 
a reduction 
of 
basal 
area 
and 
production 
of 
blue grama, 
and that tree cover, 
if it has any influence 
at all, is 
associated 
with 
an increase 
of 
blue grama. 
Although 
the shade 
and rainfall 
interception 
of the 
canopy 
may 
be detrimental 
to 
blue grama, these effects 
are off- 
set by beneficial 
effects 
which 
probably 
include 
reduced 
evapo- 
transpiration 
or more 
desirable 
temperatures. 
This study did not investigate 
the influence 
of root competition 
between 
trees 
and blue 
grama. 
Johnsen 
(1962) 
has shown 
that 
juniper 
roots 
and 
blue 
grama 
roots are concentrated 
in differ- 
ent 
soil 
depths, 
and 
Arnold 
(1964) 
reported 
no difference 
in 
basal 
intercepts 
of blue 
grama 
near 
a juniper 
tree 
and 
more 
than 17 ft from the edge of the 
canopy. 
The 
data of Arnold 
et 
al. 
(1964) 
also provide 
another 
line 
of evidence. 
If 
the 
blue 
grama 
is assumed 
to be entirely 
in the intertree 
spaces, 
and the 
grass 
intercept 
is calculated 
to 
include 
only the intertree 
space, 
there 
is little 
influence 
of tree 
cover 
on blue 
grama. 
For 
ex- 
ample, 
at 85% 
cover 
the basal 
intercept 
of 
blue 
grama 
was 
0.34%. 
If all of the blue grama 
were 
growing 
in the 
intertree 
spaces, 
the 
basal 
intercept 
of 
blue 
grama 
between 
the 
trees 
would be 0.34/0.15=2.27%. 
This 
compares 
to the figure 
of 2.36% 
for transects 
with no tree cover. 
These 
relationships 
are 
im- 
portant 
in managing 
pinyon-ju- 
niper ranges. 
Because 
the influ- 
ence 
of trees 
on blue 
grama 
is 
concentrated 
in 
the 
litter-cov- 
ered areas, little response 
of blue 
grama to tree removal 
should be 
expected 
where 
the litter 
covers 
only a small part of the area. 
In 
the litter-covered 
areas, 
the re- 
sponse of blue grama may be de- 
layed until the litter at least par- 
tially 
decomposes. 
Increases 
in 
forage 
production 
should 
be 
sought from species 
which more 
likely 
show 
root 
competition, 
such 
as 
western 
wheatgrass 
(Agropyron 
smithii Rydb.) 
(Ar- 
nold, 1964). 
Management 
follow- 
ing tree control 
should favor the 
grasses 
which 
have 
been 
held 
more 
in check 
by 
competition 
from trees. 
Summary 
Multiple 
regression 
analyses 
of 
data from plots with the vegeta- 
tion consisting 
mostly of pinyon- 
juniper 
and blue grama 
showed 
that 
tree 
litter 
was 
the 
major 
factor 
associated 
with reduction 
of blue grama. 
Tree cover either 
did not influence 
blue grama, 
or 
perhaps 
was beneficial. 
This 
study 
provides 
no data 
on the 
influence 
of 
root 
competition 
from 
trees 
on blue 
grama, 
but 
data from other studies 
indicate 
that root competition 
is probably 
slight. 
Other 
grass species, 
par- 
ticularly 
those which are deeper 
rooted than blue grama or which 

PINYON-JUNIPER 
LITTER

grow at a different 
season, 
may 
have 
a different 
relationship 
with tree cover, roots, and litter. 
Because 
the effect 
of litter 
on 
blue 
grama 
is great, 
while 
root 
competition 
from trees is appar- 
ently 
small, 
little 
immediate 
in- 
crease 
in blue grama 
should 
be 
expected 
following 
pinyon-juni- 
per control.
