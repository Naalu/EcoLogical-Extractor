The Ecological Restoration Institute is dedicated to the restoration of fire-adapted forests and woodlands. ERI provides services that support the social and 
economic vitality of communities that depend on forests and the natural resources and ecosystem services they provide. Our efforts focus on science-based 
research of ecological and socio-economic issues related to restoration as well as support for on-the-ground treatments, outreach and education.

Efficacy of Resource Objective Wildfires for Restoration of  
Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa) Forests in Northern Arizona 
By David W. Huffman, Director of Research and Development  
Introduction 
Current conditions in dry forests of the western United States have given rise to policy mandates for accelerated 
ecological restoration on U.S. National Forest System and other public lands (Vilsack 2009). In southwestern 
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests, mechanized tree thinning and prescribed fire are common restoration 
treatments but are not acceptable for all sites. Currently there is much interest in managing naturally ignited fires 
to accomplish restoration objectives (North et al. 2015), but few studies have systematically examined the effica-
cy of such “resource objective” wildfires for restoring historical ranges of variability (HRV).  
Methods 
In this study, we randomly selected 10 re-
source objective wildfires using the follow-
ing criteria: 1) fires occurred in ponderosa 
pine or pine-oak forest types on national 
forests of northern Arizona; 2) fires were 
documented as being naturally ignited and 
subsequently managed to achieve resource 
objectives; 3) fires were greater than 1,000 
acres in size; 4) spatial burn severity data 
were available; 5) time since fire was 10 
years or less; 6) the site had experienced no 
previous resource objective fire; 7) fire sites 
had not been recently thinned or salvaged 
logged. We used four burn severity classes 
identified on Monitoring Trends in Burn 
Severity (MTBS) maps to stratify field sam-
pling; and effectiveness of resource objec-
tive fires for restoring forest structure was 
defined as the percentage of 12 structural 
and hazardous fuels attributes (Table 1) 
where historical ranges of variation (HRV) 
and common ecosystem management objec-
tives were met (e.g., Reynolds et al. 2013). 
Results 
 
We found statistically significant differ-
ences among burn severity classes in 
tree density, basal area, coarse wood 
loads, canopy cover, and canopy fuel 
loads.

 
Areas classified as moderate (M) burn severity 
met HRV ranges for more attributes (67 percent) 
than did other areas in other severity classes. High 
(H) severity was within HRV for the fewest (17 
percent) of the 12 attributes (Figure 1).  
 
Restoration ranges for large snag density, tree 
patch density, maximum patch size, and tree di-
ameter distribution were not met within any burn 
severity class.  
 
Resource objective fire landscapes were com-
prised mainly of areas classified as unburned/low 
(U/L) and low (L) burn severity (85 percent), 
whereas the M severity class made up just 12 per-
cent of fire landscapes on average (Figure 1).  
 
Overall effectiveness of resource objective fires 
for meeting restoration objectives was 42 percent 
(Figure 1). 
 
Implications 
 
Effectiveness of resource objective wildfires for meeting restoration goals may be increased by managing for 
proportionally more M burn severity and allowing greater tree mortality across landscapes.  
 
To achieve more moderate-severity fire, managers will be required to accept greater risk in terms of escaped 
fires and high-severity fire. 
 
High-severity fire is least effective for meeting restoration objectives.  
 
More work will be needed to increase public awareness of the potential benefits and tradeoffs of managing 
wildfires for restoring ponderosa pine forest ecosystems.
