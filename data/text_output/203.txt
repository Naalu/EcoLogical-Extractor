Abstract
Question: How does the relationship between the viable soil
seed bank species composition and the above-ground vegeta-
tion in northern Arizona Pinus ponderosa forests differ under
varying historical land use disturbances (low, intermediate,
high)? Is above-ground vegetation correlated to the viable soil
seed bank immediately following soil disturbance from resto-
ration thinning treatments?
Location: Northern Arizona, USA.
Methods: Soil seed bank samples were taken along replicated
transects and collected with a 5-cm diameter bulk density
hammer. Samples included a 5-cm diameter O-horizon sam-
ple (at varying depths) plus the underlying mineral soil to a
depth of 5  c m . The seedling emergent method was used to
quantify seed bank species composition and density. The
herbaceous and shrub plant community was quantified along
the same transects using the point intercept method.
Results: Early-successional or ruderal species were common
in the soil seed bank at all three disturbance sites. Non-native
species, notably Verbascum thapsus, were more numerous (up
to 940 seeds/m2) under high disturbance with overgrazing and
logging, and less common or absent under low disturbance.
Most viable seeds were found in the O-horizon and the upper
5 cm of mineral soil; there was little correlation between
species in the soil seed bank and the above-ground vegetation.
Conclusions: We recommend that restoration plans be geared
toward minimizing activities, such as severe soil disturbance,
that may promote the spread of non-native invasive species,
and that manual seeding be explored as an option to restore
plant species diversity and abundance.

Introduction
Pinus ponderosa forests are a dominant vegetation
type on the Colorado Plateau in the southwestern US.
Prior to Euro-American settlement, these forests were
characterized by clumped, old-growth pines and iso-
lated trees with herbaceous understories dominated by
grasses (e.g. Cooper 1960). Low-intensity grass-fueled

surface fires recurred every 2-20 years and played a
major role in determining the structure, composition,
and stability of these ecosystems (Fulé et al. 1997;
Swetnam & Baisan 2003). However, due to a variety of
interacting factors these forests have become dense with
small-diameter trees (Moore et al. 1999, 2004). Efforts
are under way to reverse this trend toward a more open
grass savannah-like structure through restoration tree
thinning and prescribed burning (Covington et al. 1997).
An important component in predicting the natural
revegetation potential following restoration treatments
in P. ponderosa herbaceous understories is determining
the composition and abundance of the soil seed bank.
Many seed bank studies in Europe suggest a correlation
between land use disturbance history and seed bank
composition, indicating an increased abundance of early
successional (ruderal) and non-native species in high
disturbance sites (Bekker et al. 1997; Bossuyt & Hermy
2000; Bossuyt et al. 2002; Honnay et al. 2002; Matus et
al. 2003). Currently, most P. ponderosa forests are
distinguished by plant communities comprised mainly
of native species, harsh growing conditions, and long
periods without major disturbance (Laughlin et al. 2004).
There is a wealth of knowledge regarding the role
and dynamics of seed banks in numerous ecosystems
(Warr et al. 1994). However, no studies have investi-
gated the relationship between historical land use distur-
bance and soil seed bank composition and abundance in
P. pondersosa forests, which Bekker and others (1997)
indicate is important due to the general assumption that
the soil seed bank positively increases plant community
diversity. In addition, relatively few seed bank studies
have been conducted in this forest type. At a P.ponderosa
study site near Flagstaff, AZ, Vose & White (1987)
found ca. 8 viable-seeds/m2 in burned plots and 22/m2 in
control plots. A seed bank study conducted in P.
ponderosa stands in the Black Hills of South Dakota
recorded 78 seeds/m2 prior to fire and 186 seeds/m2
consisting of ten species (eight forbs, one graminoid,
one shrub) following fire (Wienk et al. 2004). In both
studies, the relatively low seed numbers indicate that the

soil seed bank may not be a significant contributor for
natural revegetation following disturbance.
In contrast, buried seeds may be a significant source
of colonization in P. ponderosa forests of east-central
Washington. Pratt et al. (1984) estimated ca. 13 500
viable-seeds/m2 occurred in the top 10 cm of the mineral
soil and associated litter in spring and autumn samples.
Seeds of 57 species were found; woody species account-
ing for only ca. 1% of the seed bank. Two non-native
species comprised 50% of the buried viable seeds. The
authors suggest that the large number of species in this
case may be due to the intermediate successional stage
with both climax and early successional species present.
Some studies indicate soil seed banks play a major
role in revegetation following disturbance (Milberg 1993;
Wilson et al. 1993; Hyatt 1999), while others suggest
the seed bank has little to no influence (Bakker et al.
1996; Morgan 1998; Bekker et al. 2000) depending on
the plant community, seed densities, seed location in the
soil profile, and whether germination requirements were
fulfilled. In native ecosystems, many studies have illus-
trated a low similarity between the composition and
density of the seed bank when compared to the above-
ground vegetation (Warr et al. 1993), and a higher
similarity in managed sites. In contrast, other studies in
forest systems have illustrated low correlations between
seed banks and above-ground vegetation in both natural
(native) and managed habitats (Abs et al. 1999; Bossuyt
et al. 2002). Our first hypothesis is that soil seed bank
species richness will not be correlated to above-ground
vegetation in recently undisturbed P. ponderosa com-
munities regardless of historical land use disturbance.
Seed bank studies in grasslands generally indicate that
the similarity between soil seed bank and above-ground
plant community prior to disturbance is low, but in-
creases following disturbance due to the establishment
of early successional species (Kirkham & Kent 1997;
Akinola et al. 1998; Ohtsuka & Ohsawa 1994; Peco et
al. 1998). Our second hypothesis is that above-ground
vegetation will be correlated to soil seed bank species
composition immediately following restoration thin-
ning in areas categorized as high historical land use
disturbance due to early successional species from the
seed bank colonizing the newly-exposed mineral soil.
Our objectives were to: (1) assess the relationship be-
tween viable soil seed bank species composition in the
O-horizon and top 5 cm of mineral soil and the above-
ground species composition in relation to historical land
use disturbance in three P. ponderosa sites in northern
Arizona, and (2) investigate the effect of soil distur-
bance from restoration thinning on the soil seed bank for
two growing seasons following the initial disturbance to
determine if post disturbance vegetation is correlated
with the viable soil seed bank.
Study area
This research was conducted at three sites in north-
ern Arizona that form a historical land use disturbance
gradient (Fig. 1). The Mt. Trumbull area within the
Grand Canyon/Parashant National Monument north of
the Grand Canyon has been the most heavily disturbed
by practices such as domestic livestock grazing, some
commercial logging and actively suppressed fires and
will be referred as the H-site, throughout the manu-
script. The next study site will be referred as the, ‘inter-
mediate disturbance, or M-site’, throughout the manu-
script. This site has been further subdivided into two
categories: ‘intermediate (low)’, ML, and ‘intermediate
(high)’, MH, for quantifying the effects of soil distur-
bance from thinning on soil seed bank dynamics. The
Fort Valley Experimental Forest near Flagstaff contains
relatively undisturbed expanses – intermediate (low)
disturbance, MH-sites, intermixed with areas that have
been grazed and commercially logged in adjacent areas
on the Coconino National Forest (MH-sites). Both sites
have experienced active fire suppression since 1876.
The third study site consists of three plateaus on the
North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, which
currently serves as our best-known example of a P.
ponderosa reference site in Arizona (Gildar et al. 2004)
and will be referred as the ‘low disturbance’, L-site
throughout the manuscript. Specific detailed informa-
tion on land use disturbance history, vegetation charac-
teristics, soil type, elevation, and climate for all three
study sites can be located at

Material and Methods
Soil seed bank and vegetation sampling
Baseline seed bank studies were initiated at the H-
site in 1997 and samples were then collected in 1999 at
the MH and ML-sites and in 2001 at the L-site. At all
three study sites, soil and vegetation measurements were
systematically sampled with minor differences from site
to site as methods were refined over time, for a total of
90, 270 and 288 samples collected at the H-, M-, and L-
sites, respectively. Soil samples were taken along repli-
cated transects at each site and collected with a 5-cm
diameter bulk density hammer (slide hammer). They
included a 5-cm diameter O-horizon sample (at varying
depths) plus the underlying mineral soil to a depth of 5
cm. Mean O-horizon depth was also measured for each
sampling location and was much smaller at the L (1.9cm)
and M-site (2.9 cm) than at the H-site (7.2 cm). While in
the field, samples from all sites were kept shaded and
dry to prevent damage from heat and mold until they
could be transferred to a greenhouse.
We also surveyed the herbaceous and shrub plant
community along the same transects where soil seed
bank samples were collected at each site. Plant species
were recorded at systematically located points along
each transect and plant species abundance was deter-
mined by dividing the number of plant hits by the total
number of points for each transect. In addition, tree
canopy cover was recorded using a vertical projection
densitometer at these same intervals along transects.
At the M-site, additional data were collected to
quantify the effects of soil disturbance from restoration
thinning on the soil seed bank and above-ground vegeta-
tion. Three experimental blocks consisting of two treat-
ment units (ca. 16 ha each) were established in 1998.
Units within these blocks were randomly assigned ei-
ther a control or treatment status (thinning to a low level
of replacement trees based upon presettlement tree den-
sities) for a total of six units. Specific details of the
thinning treatment prescriptions are outlined in Fulé et
al. (2001). There were no significant differences be-
tween control and treatment units for vegetation and site
characteristics prior to treatment (1998) (Table 1). Thin-
ning significantly reduced tree density and tree canopy
cover compared to control units in 2000 (182 trees/ha in
the thinned only units compared to 1426 trees/ha in the
paired controls) (Table 1).
We also recorded pre-treatment data for the herba-
ceous understorey composition and abundance, fuel
loads, and tree canopy cover in 1998. Post thinning
treatment data were collected in 1999 and 2000 (see
Fulé et al. 2001 for a description of overstorey sampling
methods). These data were not significantly different
between the two years; therefore, only post-treatment
data from 2000 are presented.
Greenhouse methods
The methodologies for soil seed bank sampling,
treatment of samples, and seedling inventory were
adapted from Gross (1990), Brown (1992) and Warr et
al. (1993). We used the seedling emergence method
because of its ability to determine the viable fraction of
readily germinable seeds, which is the component of the
seed bank most important for restoration management
goals. Samples (98.2 cm3) were immediately placed in
the greenhouse after collection and were not cold
stratified in this study. They were spread thinly over a
layer of ca. 5 cm of sterile soil in plastic flats ca. 11 cm
× 11 cm. We then arranged these flats randomly on a
greenhouse bench. Control flats holding a mixture of
sterilized soil were also randomly placed to account for
species germinating due to possible greenhouse
contamination. Only one greenhouse contaminate was
found in our study, Rumex spp., which was not found in
the soil seed bank samples, and therefore posed no
problem for data analysis. We fertilized flats every two

weeks with a dilute nutrient solution and inventoried
seedlings at ca. 14-day intervals. As seedlings germinated
and could be identified, we removed them from the flats
to prevent competition among seedlings. Samples were
watered as needed to maintain moist soil conditions for
six months and soil was stirred about every two months
to initiate new growth. Although seeds have been shown
to germinate in the second year after initiation of seed
bank studies, most studies have shown that the majority
of seeds germinate within the first two months and there
is little to be gained by prolonging seed bank studies for
longer than six months (Warr et al. 1993).
Statistical analysis
We used repeated measures multivariate analysis of
variance (MANOVA) in SPSS version 8 (Anon. 1997)
to determine the effects of thinning on viable soil seed
bank species composition and abundance. The soil seed
bank location (O-horizon or mineral soil), treatment
(control or thinned), and time since thinning (one or two
years) were categorical variables in the general linear
model (GLM). Significance for analysis of variance
tests was accepted at p ≤ 0.05. Tukey’s Honestly Sig-
nificant Difference (HSD) test was used to make multi-
ple comparisons of means following a significant result.
The Shapiro Wilks test was used to test data for normal-
ity and Levene’s test was used to test for homogeneity of
the variance (Milliken & Johnson 1984). Soil seed bank
and herbaceous plant abundance were square root trans-
formed to improve normality and homoscedasticity as-
sumptions when necessary (Zar 1984). The Jaccard
similarity index was used to compare whole-site seed
bank species richness and whole-site vegetation species
richness.
Results
Seed bank ecology – historical land use disturbance
gradient
At the H-site, the seed density for the O-horizon plus
the top 5 cm of mineral soil was ca. 1560 seeds/m2. The
soil seed bank contained 19 species: 12 native forbs
(including three ruderal species), three non-native forbs,
two grasses, one shrub and one unknown monocot. 60%
of the seed bank was comprised of viable seeds of the
non-native species, Verbascum thapsus (940 seeds/m2),
an early successional species of disturbed habitats. See
Table 2 for other common species.
There was little correlation between the soil seed
bank and the above-ground vegetation at the H-site
(Jaccard similarity of 0.19). A total of 24 species was
recorded in the above-ground vegetation in the transects
where seed bank samples were collected. Of those
species, only seven were found in the soil seed bank
samples. With the exception of the genus Poa, all other
species unique to the soil seed bank were annual, bien-
nial or ruderal species (see Table 3). Verbascum thapsus
was the only non-native species inventoried in the above-
ground vegetation. In the above-ground vegetation 14
native forbs were found (only two of them annuals), one
non-native forb, four trees, three shrubs, and two grasses.
At the M-site, the seed density for the O-horizon and
top 5 cm of mineral soil was 1263 seeds/m2. There were
about three times more seeds in the top 5 cm of mineral
soil than in the O-horizon. There were 24 seed bank
species: 15 native forbs (of which seven were consid-
ered ruderal), two non-native forbs, six native grami-
noids, and one tree species. The most common species,
similar to the site H, was Verbascum thapsus. Elymus
elymoides, an early successional native C3 grass (al-
though it also acts as a generalist), also had numerous
seeds in the soil seed bank. Other common species are
listed in Table 2. Species not recorded in the above-
ground vegetation on transects, although observed else-
where in the study area and therefore unique to the soil
seed bank, are listed in Table 3.
As at the H-site, there was little correlation (Jaccard
similarity of 0.29), between the soil seed bank and the
Table 2. Species with the highest number of viable seeds in the 0-5 mineral soil seed bank samples collected from three Pinus
ponderosa forests in northern Arizona along a historical land use disturbance gradient.

above-ground vegetation at the M-site. The 51 species
in the above-ground vegetation were more than double
the number of species found in soil seed bank samples.
Of the 24 species found in the seed bank only 13 were
also in the above-ground vegetation. The majority of the
species present in the seed bank and absent from the
above-ground vegetation were either ruderal or non-
native species with no non-native species inventoried in
the above-ground vegetation. The above-ground veg-
etation was comprised of 28 native forbs, six ruderal
native forbs, 13 native graminoids, three shrubs, and
one tree. Only four of the 28 native forbs were found in
both the seed bank and above-ground vegetation and
three of the ruderal forbs were found in both: Erigeron
divergens, E. flagellaris and Pseudognaphalium macounii.
Five of the 13 extant native graminoids were recorded in
the seed bank. Panicum bulbosum was present in the
seed bank and absent from the above-ground vegeta-
tion. Native graminoids were the most abundant species
in the above-ground vegetation. Of the ten most abun-
dant species in the above-ground vegetation, seven were
graminoids, comprising 83.4 % of the total foliar cover.
At the L-site, seed density for the O-horizon and top
5 cm of mineral soil averaged over the three Plateau
sites was 272.5 seeds/m2. Galahad Plateau samples con-
tained the most viable seeds/m2 (411) and Rainbow and
Powell Plateau had fairly similar numbers of seeds (195
and 212 seeds/m2 respectively). The seed bank was
comprised of 28 species and combined genera, includ-
ing 18 native forbs, two ruderal forbs, five native
graminoids, two non-native grasses and one tree species.
The most common species are listed in Table 2 and
species unique to the soil seed bank are listed in Table 3.
Of the 20 native forbs, two species were considered
ruderal and six species were annuals. The only non-
native species recorded from the seed bank were Bromus
tectorum and Phalaris canariensis (11 seeds/m2 and 4
seeds/m2 respectively). The genus Poa could not always
be accurately identified to species in the greenhouse and
therefore this grouping may have contained some non-
native Poa species.
The correlation between above- and below-ground
species was very low (Jaccard similarity of 0.18), simi-
lar to the H-site. In total 20 species were recorded both
in the above-ground vegetation and in the soil seed
bank; 78 species were unique to the extant vegetation,
but only seven species were unique to the seed bank
(Table 2). Detailed information on the above-ground
herbaceous plant community can be found in Gildar et
al. (2004).
Seed bank response to soil disturbance from small-
diameter tree thinning
Although average herbaceous plant cover tended to
be higher in thinned units than in control units 18
months after treatment, the differences were not signifi-
cant (Table 4). The herbaceous plant communities in the
experimental blocks at the M-site (Fort Valley) were
dominated by native graminoids followed by non-legu-
minous forbs, legumes, and woody shrubs following
thinning. Carex spp. dominated the herbaceous cover
along with C3 grasses including Elymus elymoides and
Poa fendleriana. Muhlenbergia montana was the only
abundant C4 grass in the experimental blocks and it was
consistently less common than the abundant C3 grasses.

there were significantly fewer species (Fig. 2a) and a
lower total number of viable seeds/m2 (Fig. 2b) in the
mineral soil compared to the O-horizon for both the
control and thinned units in 1999. There were no
significant differences between paired control and thinned
units for individual soil layers (O-horizon, 0-5 cm min-
eral soil, 5-10 cm mineral soil) for either seed bank
species richness or the total number of viable seeds/m2,
indicating that soil disturbance from thinning did not
affect seed bank species richness or the total number of
seeds per m2 in 1999 (p > 0.05). Likewise, when the soil
seed bank was divided into functional groups, neither
location (O-horizon or top 5 cm of mineral soil), treat-
ment (control or thinned unit), nor time since thinning
(six or 18 months post-thinning) showed significant
differences (p > 0.05). Native graminoids, including
sedges, in general had the most abundant viable seeds
in both the O-horizon and top 5 cm of soil for the control
and thinned units in 1999 and 2000 (Table 5).
Only data from the  ML experimental blocks (n = 2)
were used to assess responses of the seed bank and
vegetation changes to soil disturbance from thinning
because large differences in the seed banks were noted
between the intermediate disturbance ML and MH-
units, which most likely corresponded to different his-
torical land use disturbance. While statistical compari-
sons should not be made between the ML and MH-units,
qualitative assessment can provide insight into the rela-
tionship between historical land use disturbance and soil
seed banks. Verbascum thapsus was the dominant non-
native species in the seed bank for all of the ML and
MH-units (Table 5). The only other non-native species
recorded in the seed bank was Linaria dalmatica, which
is a noxious weed in Arizona (Table 5). Seed bank
samples in MH units had about seven times the overall
number of total non-native and ruderal seeds per m2
over the ML-units in 1999 (six months after thinning),
and ca. 20 times the overall number of total non-native
and ruderal seeds/m2 compared to ML units in 2000, 18
months after thinning (Table 5).
Jaccard similarity values were low between seed

1999 and 2000, respectively (Fig. 3b). Ruderal and non-
native species were more abundant in the above-ground
vegetation in the MH thinned units than L-units for both
1999 and 2000. These species were also present in more
abundant numbers in the seed bank in the MH-thinned
units (see Table 5 for a list of species).
Discussion
We found little correlation between the seed bank
and above-ground vegetation at the H, ML, and L-sites,
which supports our hypothesis that soil seed bank species
richness would not be correlated to above-ground veg-
etation in recently undisturbed P. ponderosa communi-
ties regardless of historical land use disturbance. Soil
seed bank composition of sites with high and intermedi-
ate historical land use disturbance is generally com-
prised of annuals, ruderals, and many non-natives. These
species often utilize mechanisms geared toward wide
dispersal of seeds and seeds that accumulate and persist
in the soil for long periods despite changes in the above-
ground vegetation (Ingersoll & Wilson 1993). Perennial
species have a reduced tendency to form a persistent
seed bank in comparison (Rees 1994; Morgan 1998;
Thompson et al. 1998). Milberg & Hansson (1994) have
postulated that native perennials offset the need for a
large seed bank from which to recruit after disturbance
by instead demonstrating vegetative persistence, which
can be considered the ecological equivalent to regenera-
tion through a persistent seed bank (Parker et al. 1989).
In contrast, some non-native seeds can remain viable for
50-100+ years in the soil and can be present in large
quantities (Baskin & Baskin 1985). In our study, the
MH sites had approximately seven times the number of
ruderal and non-native seed densities than the ML sites.
This high density of ruderal and non-native seed densi-
ties at the MH and H-sites is consistent with a study by
Tsuyuzaki & Kanda (1996), which illustrated that de-
spite 20 years since disturbance, ruderal and non-native
species were still abundant in the seed bank.
Tree thinning can significantly affect soil processes
due to soil profile disturbance and compaction (Jurgensen
et al. 1997), but the amount of disturbance varies with
the type of equipment used, number of trees removed,
soil moisture content at the time of thinning, and soil
characteristics (e.g., amount of soil surface organic mat-
ter) (Howard et al. 1981; Rab 1996). Our results indicate
that soil disturbance from thinning did not affect the
distribution of seed composition or density within the
soil profile. Since the majority of viable seeds tend to be
concentrated near the surface, with the O-horizon gen-
erally containing the greatest seed densities (Strickler &
Edgerton 1976; Granström 1982), this finding may equate

whole-site seed bank species composition and whole-site veg-
etation species composition from the Fort Valley intermediate

to an increased regeneration of the herbaceous commu-
nity following thinning because the majority of viable
seeds in the soil seed bank could germinate once trig-
gered by increased light, nutrients or moisture. The high
correlation between the soil seed bank and above-ground
vegetation in the MH thinned-unit in 1999 and 2000, but
not in the paired MH control unit that had a similar seed
bank composition and density for these same years,
supports our hypothesis and other research that areas
with annual, ruderal, and non-native seed banks will
have a higher correlation between the seed bank and
above-ground vegetation following disturbance than
prior to disturbance, once seeds have germinated
(Tsuyuzaki & Kanda 1996; Smith et al. 2000; Zabinski
et al. 2000). Many of these species require sufficient
light levels for germination, and changes in the light
environment through reduced tree canopy cover can
allow them to become established if their seeds are
present in the seed bank (Cook 1980) since the majority
of viable seeds are located near the surface (Moore &
Wein 1977; Pérez et al. 1998; Kramer & Johnson 1987).
The soil seed bank at the H and HM-sites consisted
mainly of ruderal and annual species. Ruderals com-

prised 50% of the species at the M, 33% at the H, and
only 11% of the species at the L-site. Verbascum thapsus
was by far the most common species in the soil seed
bank at both the H- and M-sites and made a significant
contribution to the overall number of seeds per square
meter. In contrast, V. thapsus was not observed in the
soil seed bank of the L-site, perhaps contributing to
significantly lower numbers of seeds per square meter.
V. thapsus is a biennial species that may produce over
100 000 seeds per plant with 95% of the seeds falling
within 5 m of the parent plant (Gross 1980). Therefore
one or a few samples collected in the vicinity of a
prolific plant could easily skew the results of a seed
bank study because of the sheer number of seeds in the
soil. Verbascum thapsus seeds can also remain viable in
the soil seed bank for over 100 years (Gross & Werner
1978). Gross (1980) demonstrated that V. thapsus seed-
lings grew 4-7 times faster and produced 2000 times
more biomass when growing in bare (non-vegetated)
sites, such as those often created in P. ponderosa forests
following restoration treatments. Dormancy in V. thapsus
seeds is broken by alterations in light or daily tempera-
ture changes (Vanderberghe & Van Assche 1986). The
requirements to break dormancy were more prevalent in
thinned units than in controls, which is most likely the
main contributing factor for the dramatic increase of
V. thapsus plants in the above-ground vegetation fol-
lowing thinning at the MH-unit. V. thapsus is not gener-
ally considered to be invasive, but due to fast growth
rates, large numbers of seedlings and large basal leaf
size, there is the potential for seedlings of this species to
outcompete native seedlings in the early stages of colo-
nization following restoration activities.
Perhaps of greater concern, particularly at the H-
site, is the lack of native perennial grasses when com-
pared to the M and L-sites. In communities where annu-
als, ruderals, and/or non-native species dominate the
seed bank, where the above-ground vegetation is patchy,
or where native seed sources are far from the area
undergoing restoration, the soil seed bank cannot be
relied upon to reintegrate species lost due to historical
land use disturbance or changes in climate (Morgan
1998; Halpern et al. 1999).
Management implications
One major goal of P. ponderosa restoration is to
restore the native herbaceous and shrub plant commu-
nity within a range of historical natural variability. There-
fore, land managers should factor in the soil seed bank
when designing restoration plans and ensure that oppor-
tunities for non-native recruitment from the soil seed
bank and replenishment of a non-native seed bank are
minimized (Smith et al. 2000; Honnay et al. 2002).
Priority for restoration should be in areas with low
historical land use disturbance where native species are
more abundant than ruderals and non-natives in the soil
seed bank. This recommendation is similar to re-
vegetation recommendations for restoration in other
habitats such as European grasslands (Bekker et al.
1997), fen meadows in The Netherlands (Matus et al.
2003), and European temperate forests (Bossuyt &
Hermy 2001). In addition, under some circumstances of
severe disturbance (e.g., slash pile burning and road
building), restoration may be dependent on the reintro-
duction of propagules by direct seeding or planting
(Korb et al. 2004; Springer & Laughlin 2004) rather
than the exploitation of the seed bank as found in other
studies (Bakker et al. 1996; Morgan 1998; Arkle et al.
2002).
Our study indicates that soil seed bank species vary
greatly across southwestern P. ponderosa forests based
at least in part on historical land use disturbance. A lack
of native perennial species in the soil seed bank com-
bined with a paucity of native perennials in the above-
ground vegetation will almost certainly lead to long
periods of time for native re-establishment following
restoration activities, particularly during periods of lower
than average precipitation. Likewise, non-native species
in the seed bank will lead to the presence of these
species in the above-ground vegetation following dis-
turbance, and therefore monitoring and control for non-
native species of concern, such as noxious weeds, should
be a priority. The success of increasing current low
levels of species diversity and abundance will depend
upon the availability and colonization rates of extant
plants and viable seeds in the soil seed bank as well as on
the seed rain. Manual seeding is not commonly utilized
in southwestern forest restoration due primarily to high
cost, limited native seed supplies and genetic considera-
tions, but it warrants further investigation.
