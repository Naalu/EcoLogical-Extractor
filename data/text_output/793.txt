Current conditions in dry forests of the western United State have given rise to policy mandates for accel-
erated ecological restoration on U.S. National Forest System and other public lands. In southwestern pon-
derosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forests, mechanized tree thinning and prescribed ﬁre are common
restoration treatments but are not acceptable for all sites. Currently there is much interest in managing
naturally ignited ﬁres to accomplish restoration objectives but few studies have systematically examined
the efﬁcacy of such ‘‘resource objective” wildﬁres for restoring historical ranges of variability (HRV). In
this study we used ﬁeld plots to retrospectively sample 10 resource objective ﬁres on two national forests
in northern Arizona. We used four burn severity classes identiﬁed on Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity
(MTBS) maps to stratify ﬁeld sampling and compared post-ﬁre means for 12 structure and hazardous
fuels attributes to HRV and guidelines for ecosystem management. Results indicated signiﬁcant differ-
ences among burn severity classes in tree density, basal area, coarse wood loads, canopy cover, and
canopy fuel loads. Furthermore, areas classiﬁed as moderate (M) burn severity met HRV ranges for more
attributes (67%) than did other areas in other severity classes. High (H) severity areas were within HRV
for the fewest (17%) of the 12 attributes. Restoration ranges for large snag density, tree patch density and
maximum patch size, and tree diameter distribution were not met within any burn severity class.
Resource objective ﬁre landscapes were comprised mainly (85%) of areas classiﬁed as unburned/low
(U/L) and low (L) burn severity, whereas the M severity class made up just 12% of ﬁre landscapes on aver-
age. Overall effectiveness of resource objective ﬁres for meeting restoration objectives was 42%. Results
suggested that effectiveness may be increased by managing for proportionally more moderate burn
severity on these landscapes. For this, managers will be required to accept greater risk in terms of escaped
ﬁres and high-severity ﬁre, which, in turn, will necessitate increasing public awareness of the potential
beneﬁts and limitations of managing wildﬁres for restoring ponderosa pine forest ecosystems.

1. Introduction
Landscape-scale changes in ecosystem structure and function
resulting from intensive livestock grazing and interruption of fre-
quent surface ﬁre regimes have put dry forests of western North
America at risk for large, severe wildﬁre and further degradation
with changing climatic conditions (Covington et al., 1994; Moore
et al., 1999; Savage and Mast, 2005; Westerling et al., 2006;
Reynolds et al., 2013). Past land uses and ﬁre exclusion have led
to abnormally dense stands of trees, many of which have young
cohorts that create ladder fuels, with high surface and canopy fuel
loads (Fulé et al., 1997; Agee and Skinner, 2005; Reynolds et al.,
2013). In addition, ﬁne- and mid-scale spatial patterns such as tree
point patterns, patch density, and patch sizes have been altered
since ﬁre regime interruption (Sánchez Meador et al., 2009). Cur-
rent conditions in these forests have given rise to policy mandates
for accelerated ecological restoration on US National Forest System
and other public lands (Vilsack, 2009; Franklin and Johnson, 2012;
USDA Forest Service, 2012; USDA, 2016). Currently, objectives
under ecosystem restoration policy call for reestablishing natural
ranges of variability for structure, pattern, and ecological processes
to facilitate sustainability and resilience (USDA, 2016). Natural, or
historical, ranges of variability (HRV) characterize prevalent states
and dynamics prior to widespread anthropogenic alteration of an
ecosystem (Morgan et al., 1994; Landres et al., 1999). Generally,

treatment approaches that result in structural and compositional
patterns more similar to HRV are thought to provide the best
chances for recovery from degradation and improvement in
ecosystem function (SER, 2004; Palmer et al., 2006). Thus, in addi-
tion to informing the development of treatment prescriptions, HRV
can be used as a baseline for evaluating effectiveness of restoration
treatments.
In southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forests,
mechanized tree thinning and application of prescribed ﬁre are
common approaches to restoration (Friederici, 2003). These treat-
ments can be implemented precisely – individual trees can be
selected for cutting and prescribed ﬁre behavior can be carefully
managed – and, as a result, they are known to be generally effec-
tive for accomplishing restoration objectives (Covington et al.,
1997; Roccaforte et al., 2010). However, thinning and prescribed
ﬁre are relatively costly, are typically time-consuming to imple-
ment, and mechanized tree thinning is not an acceptable alterna-
tive for all sites (e.g., steep slopes, remote locations, designated
Wilderness areas, etc.). For these reasons, there is currently much
interest in managing naturally ignited ﬁres to accomplish restora-
tion and hazardous fuels treatment objectives (e.g., North et al.,
2015).
Since the 1970s, national policies for managing wildﬁres for
resource beneﬁt have gone through numerous changes (van
Wagtendonk, 2007). For example, such ﬁres have been catego-
rized variously as ‘‘prescribed natural ﬁres”, ‘‘wildland ﬁre use
ﬁres”, ‘‘resource beneﬁt ﬁres”, and, most recently, ‘‘resource
objective ﬁres”. National ﬁre management policy in the U.S. no
longer differentiates between resource objective and suppression
ﬁres (Meyer, 2015). In fact, current directives allow objectives to
change throughout the course of a wildﬁre and different areas
within a ﬁre may be managed for different objectives. However,
wildﬁres managed for
beneﬁcial outcomes commonly
occur
when weather and fuels conditions are favorable, and in areas
where risks to values are low. In contrast, suppression responses
are typically taken during periods of more extreme weather and
when risk of damage to resources is high. Thus, in many cases,
tactics and objectives for individual ﬁres are pointed distinctly
toward either management for resource objectives, or suppres-
sion, regardless of policy direction. Although resource objective
wildﬁres appear to hold promise for restoration and hazardous
fuels reduction, few studies have systematically examined these
assumptions across a broad geographic area. Case studies and
others focused on isolated sites in the Southwest have indicated
that effects within ﬁres are variable and changes to forest struc-
ture are related to burn severity (Fulé and Laughlin, 2007;
Hunter et al., 2011; Higgins et al., 2015). As burn severity clas-
siﬁcations reﬂect changes to aboveground biomass, higher burn
severity classes (e.g., moderate to high burn severity) indicate
greater changes in forest overstory structure, and therefore
would be expected to move conditions closer to HRV than lower
severity classes (Miller and Thode, 2007; Hunter et al., 2011).
However, due to managers’ concerns of the potential for an
escaped ﬁre, and a need to protect landscape values at risk, sub-
stantial areas within resource objective wildﬁre perimeters can
remain unburned, or burned at low severity, and thus represent
minimal changes in forest structure or crown ﬁre potential.
To investigate their efﬁcacy for restoring HRV of structural and
hazardous fuels attributes, we sampled 10 resource objective wild-
ﬁres on two National Forests in northern Arizona. We asked the
following research questions: (1) Are there differences in structural
and hazardous fuels attributes among burn severity classes within
resource objective wildﬁres? (2) Are structural and fuels attributes
within HRV and restoration objective ranges? (3) How effective
have resource objective ﬁres been overall for meeting restoration
objectives?
2. Methods
2.1. Selection of study sites
To objectively select ﬁres for study, the following criteria were
used: (1) ﬁres occurred in ponderosa pine or pine-oak forest types
on National Forests of northern Arizona; (2) ﬁres were documented
as being naturally ignited and subsequently managed to achieve
resource objectives; (3) ﬁres were greater than 405 ha in size; (3)
spatial burn severity data were available (see below); (4) time
since ﬁre was 10 years or less; (5) the site had experienced no pre-
vious resource objective ﬁre; (6) ﬁre sites had not been recently
thinned or salvage-logged. These criteria represented common site
conditions on National Forest lands in the region, and also allowed
us to focus on larger ﬁres that had potential to show variation in
structural patterns at a range of spatial scales (Reynolds et al.,
2013). To identify ﬁres that met criteria related to forest type, man-
agement objectives, size, and history, we used the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service Region 3 ﬁre his-
tory database. We cross-referenced these ﬁres with those compiled
in the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) database (www.
mtbs.gov), for which georeferenced burn severity data layers were
available. MTBS is an interagency project in the United States
developed to provide a national analysis of trends in burn severity
for all types of wildland ﬁre (Eidenshink et al., 2007). The selection
process yielded 17 ﬁres meeting all criteria. From these ﬁres, we
randomly selected 10 ﬁres for study on the Coconino and Kaibab
National Forests in northern Arizona (Fig. 1).
Most ﬁres selected (6 of 10) had burned 65 years prior to sam-
pling, and one ﬁre selected burned 10 years prior to sampling
(Table 1). Sites ranged from 1957 to 2423 m in elevation. Average
maximum summer temperature ranged 26–29 C, minimum win-
ter temperature ranged 3 to 7 C, and annual precipitation ran-
ged 495–664 mm (WRCC, 2016). Precipitation in the region of the
study sites falls in a bimodal pattern of summer, monsoonal rain
and winter snow. Prior to the monsoon season (mid-July through
September), spring and early summer is distinctly dry and often
windy. Soils were variable across the 10 sites, but represented
those typically found in dry forests of northern Arizona (Table 1).
Although forests overstories were predominantly composed of
ponderosa pine, Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.) is also com-
mon in these ecosystems. Other species occasionally found include
Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), white ﬁr (Abies
concolor (Gord. & Glend.) Lindl. ex Hildebr.), quaking aspen (Popu-
lus tremuloides Michx.), southwestern white pine (P. strobiformis
Engelm.), alligator juniper (Juniperus deppeana Steud.), Utah juni-
per (J. osteosperma (Torr.) Little), one seed juniper (J. monosperma
(Engelm.) Sarg.), and pinyon pine (P. edulis Engelm.). Understories
of these forests are composed primarily of herbaceous species
and typify the ponderosa-bunchgrass ecosystem (Brown, 1994).
To better understand environmental conditions under which
the ﬁres had been allowed to burn, we used FireFamilyPlus 4.1
(Bradshaw and McCormick, 2000) to summarize fuels and weather
parameters on the day of ﬁre ignition (Table 1). Most of the ﬁres
ignited in June-July on days with average temperatures in the
mid-upper 20 s (C). Relative humidity on ﬁre start dates ranged
24–95%, and daily wind speeds averaged 13 k h1 or less. Energy
release quotient was above 20 for all but two ﬁres, and fuel mois-
tures ranged 4–20% and 8–15% for 1-h and 1000-h moisture time-
lag classes, respectively (Table 1).
2.2. Design and sampling
To investigate effectiveness of ﬁres in meeting restoration
objectives, we established ﬁeld plots within the 10 ﬁres using a
396

random, stratiﬁed sampling approach. Stratiﬁcation was based on
the spatial burn severity maps downloaded from the MTBS data-
base, and the following burn severity classes were identiﬁed as
our sampling strata: unburned/low (U/L); low (L); moderate (M);
and high (H). To classify burn severity, MTBS uses a multi-
temporal approach wherein differenced normalized burn ratio
(dNBR) values are calculated using Landsat imagery (30-m resolu-
tion) as the difference in pre-ﬁre and post-ﬁre reﬂectance in spec-
tral bands 4 and 7 (near-infrared and shortwave infrared spectral
ranges, respectively). Resulting values of dNBR are partitioned into
discrete classes based on interpretation of thresholds apparent in
the data, along with evaluation of raw pre- and post-ﬁre imagery,
plot data, and analyst experience. Burn severity classes derived fol-
lowing this algorithm represent a range of ﬁrst-order ﬁre effects on
vegetation biomass (Eidenshink et al., 2007). Although the dNBR
method has been criticized for inaccuracies, particularly as related
to interpretation of forest conditions within low burn severity (i.e.,
minimal change) areas, and when common severity thresholds are
used across forest types without ﬁeld veriﬁcation (Miller and
Thode, 2007), Cocke et al. (2005) found dNBR classiﬁcation to be
strongly related to ground based measures of burn severity when
multiple variables in addition to tree mortality are evaluated. We
chose to use MTBS burn severity classiﬁcations as strata for our
sampling for the following reasons: (1) we expected burn severity
classes to reﬂect relative changes in forest structure and therefore
inﬂuence interpretation of efﬁcacy of ﬁres for meeting restoration
objectives; (2) by pooling ﬁeld samples within severity classes, our
study design was robust to potential errors noted for classiﬁcation

of low burn severity areas; (3) our study was restricted to evalua-
tion of previously untreated ponderosa pine forests in northern
Arizona; and (4) MTBS maps are readily available and commonly
used by public forest managers in planning responses to large ﬁres.
To stratify sampling of ﬁres, we used a geographic information
system (GIS) to randomly assign sample plot locations within the
four severity classes To assure that sample plots would be estab-
lished within the intended burn severity classes in the ﬁeld, we
buffered plot locations using a 0.81-ha (90  90-m) minimum
patch size. The 0.81-ha minimum patch size along with variability
in spatial patterns of burn severity within ﬁres limited the number
of suitable plot locations for sampling. Thus, two to eight sample
plot locations were identiﬁed within each severity class, for each
ﬁre. In the ﬁeld, we used handheld global positioning systems
(GPS) units to navigate to sample plot locations. At each location,
a circular, ﬁxed-area sample plot (4400 m2) was established to
measure forest structure and surface fuels. Within each plot, we
collected the following measurements for all live trees (P1.37 m
in height): (1) species; (2) diameter at breast height (dbh; 1.37 m
above ground level); (3) total height; and (4) crown base height.
We also recorded species, dbh, and height for all standing dead
trees within each plot. Surface fuels were measured on two,
15.2-m planar transects per plot according to methods described
in Brown (1974). Fuels transects were systematically oriented
along the south and west cardinal directions from plot center.
2.3. Analysis
To address our main research questions, we tested for effects of
burn severity on a set of structural and hazardous fuels attributes,
evaluated whether ﬁres were meeting restoration objectives for
these attributes, and calculated overall efﬁcacy of resource objec-
tive ﬁres for meeting restoration objectives. We ﬁrst identiﬁed
ranges of values to represent restoration objectives for a set of 12
structural and hazardous fuels attributes (Table 2). These ranges
were obtained from published literature concerning restoration
and ecosystem management of southwestern ponderosa pine for-
ests. Because restoration relies on historical ranges of variability
to guide development of treatment objectives (Moore et al.,
1999; Sánchez Meador et al., 2011; Reynolds et al., 2013), we used
published HRV information where possible to identify attribute
value ranges that served as restoration objectives. For coarse wood
load and large snag density, HRV information was not available; in
these cases, we used published guidelines for ecosystem manage-
ment (Table 2). Next, we calculated values for each of the 12 attri-
butes from ﬁeld sample plot data and GIS spatial layers. For
statistical tests, we summarized data within burn severity classes
and ﬁres to produce one attribute value per burn severity class,
for each ﬁre (n = 6–10). Attribute values calculated from sample
plot data were tree density (no. ha1), basal area (m2 ha1), coarse
wood load (Mg ha1), large snag density (no. ha1), canopy base
height (m), canopy fuel load (kg m2), and canopy bulk density
(kg m3). Coarse wood load was calculated from planar transect
data according to methods in Brown (1974) for surface fuels
>7.6 cm in diameter. Large snags were deﬁned as standing dead
trees >45.7 cm dbh, and >9.2 m in height (Ganey et al., 2015).
Canopy bulk density and canopy fuel load were calculated using
allometric equations relating dbh to component biomass (i.e., foli-
age and ﬁne branches) for individual tree species and followed
methods outlined by Roccaforte et al. (2015).
Canopy cover (%) and spatial metrics based on canopy cover
(tree patch density, mean tree patch size, and maximum tree patch
size) were derived for each ﬁre using National Agricultural Imagery
Program (NAIP) imagery (1  1 m resolution) acquired in 2015
(www.usgs.gov). Imagery was loaded into a GIS and a ratio band
was created by dividing the near infrared and red (bands 4 and
1, respectively) (Pelz and Dickinson, 2014). The ratio band was
merged with the red, green, and blue bands using ERDAS Imagine
software, version 16.0. Test classiﬁcations indicated that 25 classes
limited confusion between tree canopy and forest openings. Thus, a
25-class unsupervised classiﬁcation was run and then each class
was evaluated by overlaying with NAIP imagery to verify canopy,
no canopy, confused, or canopy shadow classes. Google Earth and
the original NAIP imagery were used to verify the classiﬁcation.
Next, confused and canopy shadow classes where used to mask
the NAIP imagery, and a 12-class unsupervised classiﬁcation was
run on the masked image. Twelve classes proved most effective
in distinguishing between tree canopies and openings although
no formal accuracy assessment was performed on this or any of
the other classiﬁcations. Again, each individual class was evaluated
against the NAIP imagery and given the appropriate ‘‘canopy” or
‘‘no-canopy” label. On ﬁres that had a shrub component, a third
mask/classiﬁcation/evaluation routine was run to separate shrub
cover from tree canopies. The resulting ‘‘canopy”/‘‘no-canopy”
classiﬁcations were combined, and percentages of focal areas clas-
siﬁed as canopy cover were calculated for each burn severity class
polygon (i.e., MTBS maps) sampled with ﬁeld plots. To calculate
tree patch metrics, distinct tree canopy patches (continuous areas
classiﬁed as canopy cover and thus representing interlocking tree
canopies) were ﬁltered to include only those patches greater than
100 m2, thus minimizing the inclusion of single trees. Once ﬁltered,
patch metrics were quantiﬁed and summarized by MTBS severity

class for each ﬁre. Tree patch density, mean tree patch size, and
maximum tree patch size were estimated from the canopy cover
layers using the raster (Hijmans and van Etten, 2012) rgdal
(Bivand et al., 2015) and SDMTools (VanDerWal et al., 2014) pack-
ages in R version 3.2.1 (R Core Team 2015). As with canopy cover,
patch metric estimates were generated for the burn severity poly-
gons that were sampled in the ﬁeld.
We used analysis of variance (ANOVA) to analyze for effects of
burn severity class on forest structure and hazardous fuels attri-
butes. When main effects were found (p 6 0.05) we used the
Tukey-Kramer HSD (honestly signiﬁcant difference) post-hoc tests
to compare means among the four burn severity classes (Kuehl,
1994). To test whether restoration objectives were being met
within each of the four burn severity classes, we calculated 95%
conﬁdence intervals (CI; df = 5–9) for each attribute of interest.
CIs were compared with restoration objective ranges and when
CIs overlapped with the objective ranges we considered the objec-
tive to be met. Restoration objectives were considered not met if
CIs did not overlap with reference ranges, or if the CI included zero.
We used chi-squared tests (df = 2) to compare live tree diameter
distributions within burn severity classes sampled in ﬁeld plots
to

using
the
basal
area-
maximum diameter method (BDq) and a diminution quotient (q)
of 1.2 (Reynolds et al., 2013). Distributions were based on three
diameter classes: 0–20 cm; 20.1–40 cm, and >40 cm dbh. Effective-
ness of resource objective ﬁres for restoring forest structure was
deﬁned as the percentage of the 12 structural and hazardous fuels
attributes where objective ranges were met. We evaluated effec-
tiveness in this manner for each of the four burn severity classes.
Area-weighted effectiveness for each burn severity class was calcu-
lated as effectiveness ⁄ ‘‘landscape representation”. Landscape rep-
resentation was the mean percentage of ﬁre areas comprised by
each burn severity class. Lastly, overall effectiveness was calcu-
lated as the sum of the area-weighted effectiveness values for each
burn severity class.
3. Results
3.1. Burn severity effects
Mean landscape representation (i.e., ﬁre area (%) within each
severity class) of the four burn severity classes were 35.8%,
50.0%, 12.0%, and 1.9% for U/L (unburned/low), L (low), M (moder-
ate), and H (high), respectively (Fig. 2). Clear trends in attribute
means were apparent across burn severity classes, and six of the
12 restoration and hazardous fuels attributes were signiﬁcantly
(p < 0.05) affected by burn severity (Table 3). For example, tree
density was signiﬁcantly higher in the U/L and L severity classes
compared with the M class, which in turn showed higher density
than the H class. Compared with the U/L class, ﬁre-related mortal-
ity reduced tree density by 31.2%, 64.5%, and 97.5% on average in L,
M, and H classes, respectively. Basal area followed the same pat-
tern as tree density with signiﬁcantly higher values in U/L and L
classes, and the lowest mean BA value in the H class (Table 3).
On average, ﬁres reduced BA by 11.4%, 51.9%, and 98.3% in L, M,
and H classes, respectively, as compared with BA in the U/L class.
Coarse wood load was signiﬁcantly lower in U/L an L classes than
M and H severities, which showed statistically similar amounts
of course wood. We found no main effects for large snags, and den-
sities were statistically similar among the burn severity classes.
Likewise, there were no effects of severity on tree patch density,
mean tree patch size, or maximum tree patch size (Table 3).
Canopy cover was signiﬁcantly higher in U/L, L, and M classes com-
pared with the H severity class. There were no effects of burn
severity on canopy base height. Canopy fuel load was signiﬁcantly
affected by burn severity with a clear trend of decrease from the U/
L to the H severity class (Table 3). Canopy bulk density showed a
similar pattern as canopy fuel load with signiﬁcantly decreasing
amounts with increasing burn severity.
3.2. Restoration objectives
Restoration objectives for structural and hazardous fuels attri-
butes were met to various degrees by all burn severity classes
(Table 3). Tree densities were higher than HRV in the U/L
(unburned/low) and L (low) severity classes. Tree density in the
M (moderate) severity class fell within the HRV objective range,
but was variable in the H (high) severity class (CI included zero)
(Table 3). Class U/L was above HRV for basal area, whereas BA in
L and M classes was within HRV. BA in the H burn severity was
highly variable. All burn severity classes were within the objective
range for coarse wood load (Table 3). Large snag densities were
highly variable, and CIs for all burn severity classes included zero
(Table 3). HRV for tree patch density was not met by any burn
severity class. In contrast, HRV for mean patch size was met within
all burn severity classes (Table 3). Maximum tree patch size was
not met within U/L and L classes, whereas CIs within M and H
severity classed included zero. Canopy cover means in the U/L
and L burn severity classes were above HRV. Only the M severity
class was within HRV for canopy cover (Table 3). Canopy base
height was below HRV in the U/L class, within the objective range
in the L and M severity classes, and CI for canopy base height in the
H severity class included zero. HRV for canopy fuel load was met
by all burn severity classes except H (Table 3). Canopy bulk density
was above HRV in the U/L class, whereas both L and M severity
classes were within HRV. Again, the CI for canopy bulk density in
the H severity class was highly variable and included zero. No burn
severity classes met the objective for tree diameter distribution; U/
L, L, and H classes were deﬁcient in larger trees (>40.0 cm dbh), and
U/L, L, and M severity classes showed an overabundance in mid-
sized trees (20.1–40.0 cm dbh) (Fig. 3).
In terms of effectiveness, the U/L burn severity class met
restoration objectives for 25% of the attributes and the L severity
class was 50% effective. The M class met more restoration targets
than the other classes and was 67% effective. Burn severity class
H was least effective as it met objectives for just 17% of the attri-
butes examined. Overall effectiveness (area-weighted for all sever-
ities) of resource objective ﬁres for restoring ponderosa pine
structure and fuels characteristics was 42% (Fig. 2).

4. Discussion
4.1. Efﬁcacy of resource objective ﬁres
Random sampling of 10, large (>405 ha) resource objective
wildﬁres on the Coconino and Kaibab National Forests indicated
that these ﬁres have been variably effective for restoration of stand
structure and hazardous fuels characteristics in ponderosa pine
forests of northern Arizona. Effectiveness was related to burn
severity and we observed clear trends among the four burn sever-
ity classes in nearly all structural and hazardous fuels attributes.
Means were statistically different among burn severity classes for
50% of the attributes examined. These ﬁndings suggest that before
ﬁres occurred, forests were relatively homogenous in terms of
structure and fuels. Widespread exclusion of frequent surface ﬁres
beginning in the latter part of the 19th century resulted in millions
of acres of dense stand conditions in ponderosa pine forests of the
American Southwest (Moore et al., 1999). Our results indicate that
overall recent resource objective wildﬁres have only moderately
reduced stand structure and hazardous fuel loading; on average,
more than 85% of the area within the ﬁres was classiﬁed as U/L
(unburned/low) to L (low) burn severity.
Areas classiﬁed as M (moderate) burn severity were 33–300%
more effective than the other severity classes at meeting restora-
tion objectives. Further, HRV for tree density and canopy cover
were only met in M severity areas (Table 3). However, areas classi-
ﬁed as M burn severity made up just 12% of the ﬁre landscapes on
average (Fig. 2). Other studies of resource objective ﬁres have also
shown greater effectiveness of moderate-severity ﬁre for meeting
restoration and hazardous fuels objectives as compared with
low-severity ﬁre (Fulé and Laughlin, 2007; Taylor, 2010; Hunter
et al., 2011; Higgins et al., 2015). For example, Hunter et al.
(2011) found that moderate/high-severity areas of resource objec-
tive ﬁres in ponderosa pine forests of the Gila National Forest in
New Mexico showed lower tree density, basal area, and canopy
bulk density, and higher crown base height than low-severity
and unburned areas. In their study, low burn-severity areas
reduced tree density and increased crown base height but showed
no difference in basal area or crown bulk density compared with
unburned areas (Hunter et al., 2011). In our study, areas classiﬁed
as L burn severity comprised more landscape area than any other
burn severity classes (Fig. 2). Similarly, Meyer (2015) found that
resource objective wildﬁres in frequent-ﬁre forest types of the
southern Sierra Nevada were dominated by low-severity ﬁre. In
this sense, the ﬁres studied by Meyer (2015) were within natural
ranges of variation (i.e., HRV; see Landres et al., 1999) for burn
severity; however, effectiveness of these ﬁres for restoring forest
structure was not examined. We found L-severity areas to be 50%
effective at meeting restoration objectives but L burn severity
met no structural or fuels attributes uniquely. Rather, objective
ranges for all attributes met by L were also met by M burn severity,
and 50% (3 of 6) of those met by L were also met by the U/L severity
class. Higgins et al. (2015) found that a low-severity, single-entry
resource objective ﬁre in a white-ﬁr-encroached ponderosa pine
forest of Grand Canyon National Park did little to restore tree spe-
cies composition, but second-entry ﬁres reduced white ﬁr regener-
ation. It is well known that low-severity prescribed ﬁre meets few
restoration objectives in these ecosystems if not preceded by
mechanized tree thinning (Sackett et al., 1996; Fulé et al., 2002;
Hunter et al., 2011; Roccaforte et al., 2015).
Areas classiﬁed as H severity showed highly variable mean
intervals, and intervals for two-thirds of the attributes we exam-
ined included zero (Table 3). Further, CIs for tree density, basal
area, canopy cover, canopy fuel load, and canopy bulk density in
the H severity class were all lower than HRV, and quantities of
structural elements such as live trees, snags, and logs were very
low, and often completely absent in H-severity areas. Historically,
ﬁne-grained forest structural patterns were maintained by fre-
quent surface ﬁre (Swetnam and Baisan, 1996; Van Horne and
Fulé, 2006; Abella and Denton, 2009; Sánchez Meador et al.,
2011), and forest openings are thought to have been generally
<0.20 ha in size (Pearson, 1923). There is very little documented

evidence of larger high-severity patches in presettlement pon-
derosa pine forests of the Southwest (but see Iniguez et al.,
2009). Although Williams and Baker (2012) surmised that large
landscapes of ponderosa pine and dry mixed conifer forests in
northern Arizona experienced historical high-severity ﬁre, these
conclusions, and ﬁndings based on similar assumptions, have been
sharply criticized and are not supported by dendrochronological
analyses (Fulé et al., 2013; Huffman et al., 2015; Stephens et al.,
2015; Stevens et al., 2016). In fact, historical ranges of variability
for patch metrics (e.g., tree patch density, mean patch size, and
maximum patch size) based on dendrochronological reconstruc-
tions suggest that frequent surface ﬁres in ponderosa pine forests
of the Southwest generally maintained ﬁne-grained structural pat-
terns, and large openings created by infrequent, high-severity ﬁre
were rare (Sánchez Meador et al., 2011). Similarly, stand recon-
structions at several northern Arizona sites have indicated histori-
cal
‘‘inverse-J”-shaped
diameter
or
irregular,
uneven-aged
distributions, which further supports the hypothesis that stand-
replacing ﬁres were very uncommon prior to Euro-American set-
tlement of the region (Fulé et al., 1997, 2002, 2006; Sánchez
Meador et al., 2010). Thus, the H burn severity class was least effec-
tive at meeting structural and hazardous fuels objectives, and con-
ditions within these areas appeared to be less desirable even than
those within U/L areas. Indeed, H-severity areas showed conditions
resulting from uncharacteristically severe ﬁre that restoration pre-
scriptions are commonly developed to mitigate (Reynolds et al.,
2013).
Areas classiﬁed as U/L were 25% effective and comprised 36% of
ﬁre landscapes on average (Fig. 2). Although ﬁre effects on forest
structure were nonexistent to minimal, these areas surprisingly fell
within restoration objective ranges for three attributes – coarse
wood load, mean tree patch size, and canopy fuel load (Table 3).
This likely resulted, in part, from broad ranges for these attributes.
For example, Brown et al. (2003) suggested an optimal quantity of
coarse woody material to be 11–45 Mg ha1 after ﬁre in western
dry forests, and this broad range was intended to balance accept-
able ﬁre hazard and potential severity with needs for soil produc-
tivity as well as wildlife habitat. We adopted this range as an
objective in our study as very little is known concerning historical
amounts of coarse wood and HRV information is not readily avail-
able. Other studies in southwestern ponderosa pine forests have
reported background (i.e., within untreated areas) coarse wood
loads to range between 11 and 45 Mg ha1 (Fulé et al., 2002,
2006). Similar to coarse wood load, relatively little research has
quantiﬁed historical ranges for spatial metrics such as tree patch
density or patch size (Reynolds et al., 2013). We found a clear pat-
tern of decreasing mean tree patch size with increasing burn sever-
ity (Table 3); however, the reported HRV for tree patch size
spanned more than two orders of magnitude (Table 2). Thus,
although large dead and down logs and tree spatial patterns are
important for wildlife habitat quality and ecosystem function
(Ganey et al., 2015; Rodman et al., 2016), our results indicate that
these attributes are relatively poor indicators (i.e., too variable or
insensitive) of ﬁre effectiveness and restoration success in south-
western ponderosas pine ecosystems. Canopy fuel load in the U/L
burn severity class was within the restoration objective range
and low (0.687 kg m2) compared with other reported values for
undisturbed ponderosa pine forests. Canopy fuel loads commonly
range between 0.7 and 1.2 kg m2 in untreated areas where the
historical ﬁre regime has been disrupted (Fulé et al., 2001, 2002,
Roccaforte et al., 2008, 2015). Canopy fuel load is important in
affecting potential ﬁre behavior, and although this attribute in U/
L areas was within HRV, we found it to be sensitive to burn severity
(Table 3) and suggest that it is valuable as an indicator to evaluate
resource objective ﬁre efﬁcacy.
4.2. Limitations
In our study, we evaluated resource objective wildﬁres for
meeting restoration objective ranges for forest structure and haz-
ardous fuels; however, HRV information was either scant or not
available for attributes related to coarse woody material (logs
and large snags) and tree spatial patterns. We chose to include
these attributes in our analysis due to their importance in inﬂuenc-
ing ecological function and because they are commonly considered
in ponderosa pine restoration frameworks (e.g., Reynolds et al.,
2013). More work is needed to accurately describe coarse wood
quantities and spatial characteristics of trees and tree groups, per-
haps by utilizing precise stem mapping and dendrochronological
reconstruction techniques (see Sánchez Meador et al., 2011).
In our study we could not examine the importance of pre-ﬁre
forest conditions in affecting burn severity patterns or resulting
structural characteristics. However, clear directional trends in
attribute means across burn severity classes and low variability
in U/L and L classes suggest relatively homogenous pre-ﬁre struc-
tural conditions. Thus, dNBR classiﬁcation (MTBS) appeared to be
adequate for sample stratiﬁcation and coarse assessment of post-
ﬁre effects. Extensive, dense forest conditions resulting from his-
torical ﬁre exclusion across large landscapes in the Southwest have
been widely discussed and are the basis for policy mandates to
accelerate restoration treatments (Covington et al., 1994; Fulé
et al., 1997; Moore et al., 1999; Reynolds et al., 2013).
In our study, we did not evaluate undesirable effects that may
be associated with different burn severity classes. For example,
other
studies
have
reported
expansion
of
populations
and
increases in cover of exotic plant species after high severity ﬁre
in western dry forests (Crawford et al., 2001; Rew and Johnson,
2010; Abella and Fornwalt, 2015), although these patterns are
inconsistent (Dodge et al., 2008; Kuenzi et al., 2008). Other impor-
tant effects that may be related to burn severity include insect and
disease responses, impacts on soils, and undesirable hydrologic
changes. Lastly, we focused our work on single-entry ﬁres and
did not study possible additive effects of multiple burns. Based
on our observations, single-entry ﬁres are more common than
multiple-entry sites on USDA Forest Service landscapes in the
Southwest, with the possible exception of some designated
Wilderness areas. Holden et al. (2007) found that multiple entries
with resource objective wildﬁres reduced density of small-
diameter trees in two remote forest locations in Arizona and
New Mexico. Hunter et al. (2011) reported that areas receiving
multiple ﬁre entries were similar to single-entry, low-severity ﬁres
in terms of tree density, basal area, and canopy bulk density. More
research is needed to better assess whether multiple-entry ﬁres
result in greater restoration beneﬁts than single-entry ﬁres, partic-
ularly in the low burn severity areas (i.e., repeated low-severity
ﬁre) that dominate these ﬁre landscapes.
4.3. Implications
National Forest System policy mandates accelerated ecological
restoration treatments, and for frequent-ﬁre ponderosa pine for-
ests, restoration of overstory structural patterns more similar to
HRV can be consistent with improving resistance to drought and
crown
ﬁre
occurrence
(Fulé,
2008;
Reynolds
et
al.,
2013;
Stephens et al., 2013). We acknowledge that the use of HRV to
set structural and hazardous fuels treatment objectives may not
be feasible on many sites due to a variety of social, economic,
and logistical limitations (Higgs, 1997; Reynolds et al., 2013), and
indeed, several authors have questioned the continued focus on
precise approximation of HRV, particularly in light of uncertainties
associated with climatic change (Falk, 2006; Millar et al., 2007;
D.W. Huffman et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 389 (2017) 395–403
401

Hart et al., 2015; Jacobs et al., 2015). Concerns related to climate
change as well as a desire to incorporate contemporary societal
values have led some authors to suggest ‘‘future ranges of varia-
tion” (FRV) as an alternative concept for setting restoration objec-
tives (Duncan et al. 2010). However, simulation of long-term
responses suggest that sustaining dry forests in the Southwest is
tenuous under more severe climate change scenarios, but restora-
tion treatments that reduce stand density and reintroduce surface
ﬁre may lower tree mortality and extend persistence of dominant
species such as ponderosa pine (Shive et al., 2014; Tarancón et al.,
2014; Stoddard et al., 2015). Similarly, resource objective wildﬁres
in these systems may meet a greater number of restoration objec-
tives and increase ecological resilience if managed to allow more
moderate-severity burning to occur. Our comparison of conditions
among burn severity classes suggested that HRV objectives are met
if ﬁre-related mortality reduces tree density by about 64% and
basal area by 11–52%. In contrast, tree density remained higher
than HRV when ﬁre-related mortality was 31% or less. Greater burn
severity may be sought in areas where values at risk are few, such
as in more remote wildland zones. This may be achieved by per-
mitting ﬁres to burn under more extreme weather conditions. Fires
evaluated in our study took place under conditions of high relative
humidity, low wind speed, and high ﬁne fuel moistures (Table 1)
(see Fulé et al., 2002; Roccaforte et al., 2008). Moderate weather
conditions likely resulted in combined areas of U/L and L burn
severity classes occurring on over 85% of the ﬁre landscapes.
Allowing ﬁres to burn more actively to achieve greater representa-
tion of the M severity class requires managers to accept more risk
in terms of the potential for escaped ﬁres. In addition, we found the
H burn severity class to meet the fewest restoration objectives, and
it is likely that landscape representation of this class will increase
along with increases in M burn severity. These risks may be man-
aged, however, through increasing public awareness of the poten-
tial ecological and economic beneﬁts of ﬁre use, and greater
coordination among public land management agencies (North
et al., 2015).
