Abstract
Five years after ecological restoration treatments in a ponderosa pine-Gambel oak forest, we re-measured permanent plots to
assess changes in forest structure and understory vegetation. The treatments were (1) thinning to emulate pre-ﬁre-exclusion
conditions + prescribed burning (FULL restoration), (2) minimal thinning around old trees + burning (MIN), (3) burning alone
(BURN), and (4) CONTROL. We expected tree growth and understory abundance to be greatest in the least dense (FULL)
treatment. Probably due to drought as well as treatment effects, basal area, tree density, and canopy cover declined 3–20% over
the 2000–2004 time period. Smaller trees and those with greater crown scorch were most likely to die. Tree growth differed
signiﬁcantly by species and treatment; ponderosa pine grew faster than oak and the FULL treatment had the highest pine basal
area increment and quadratic mean diameter. Understory plant cover and richness differed only slightly by treatment, generally
varying more with pre-existing conditions and climate. Exotic species were present but exotic cover and richness were less than
that reported after comparable treatments or wildﬁres in the region. Compared to historical reference conditions at the time of the
last surface ﬁre, 1887, the FULL was less dense and all treatments were relatively low in basal area, due to 20th century
harvesting of most of the large pines. At current growth rates and without additional mortality, the FULL treatment may be
similar to historical forest structures in 20 years. Tree densities in other treatments are expected to remain above historical
levels. The dynamics of stands following alternative restoration treatments are of high interest for management because large
areas have been proposed for treatment but there is limited data on effects.

1. Introduction
Ecological restoration of forests adapted to frequent
surface ﬁre regimes has been widely advocated in the
southwestern USA to reduce the hazard of severe
wildﬁresand restore natural habitats. There is a range of
views, however, on the appropriate goals and techni-
ques for restoration. Covington (2000) underscored the
urgency of habitat loss due to uncharacteristically
severe disturbances, calling for rapid management
intervention. Evaluating the same situation, however,
Allen et al. (2002) emphasized that intervention also

posed risks and suggested that diverse treatments,
incremental approaches, and careful monitoring would
provide the most useful information.
While
an
extensive
program
of
methodical
research would be desirable, however, forest man-
agement occurs in a social environment where
people may overreact to perceived concern about
large wildﬁres (Kauffman, 2004). Therefore, it is
appropriate to learn as much as possible from
opportunistic studies and from the relatively few and
recent controlled experiments studying restoration
alternatives.
Despite high interest, there are only a handful of
experimental restoration sites in southwestern forests,
such as projects in Colorado (Romme et al., 2003) and
Arizona (Covington et al., 1997; Waltz et al., 2003;
Skov et al., 2005). Additional experiments are
underway in association with the nationwide Fire/
Fire Surrogates project, but only limited information is
available to date (e.g., Metlen et al., 2004). Substantial
testing of restoration of surface ﬁre has been done in
the Southwest (e.g., Weaver, 1951; Sackett and Haase,
1998), but the earliest project deliberately aimed at
restoring structure, function, and composition of a
ponderosa pine ecosystem to conditions within the
natural range of variability was initiated at the Gus
Pearson Natural Area in 1992 (Covington et al., 1997).
The study addressed tree physiological responses
(Feeney et al., 1998; Stone et al., 1999) and ecosystem
level responses (Kaye and Hart, 1998), showing
increased photosynthesis and growth of trees in
thinned and thinned + burned areas, as well as sharp
increases in understory productivity (Moore et al., in
press). The 3-ha Pearson area remains the only
experimental site with more than immediate or
>3 year post-treatment data. Tree condition was
assessed at six years post-treatment by Kolb et al.
(2001) and Wallin et al. (2004) reported that
physiological changes, such as increased photosynth-
esis, were sustained in old trees for seven years after
treatment. Elsewhere, little is known about the
persistence of treatment effects or delayed responses
to treatments.
In 1997, we collaborated with the Kaibab National
Forest and Grand Canyon National Park to compare
three restoration treatments. The treatments included
(a) extensive thinning to emulate pre-ﬁre-exclusion
conditions + prescribed burning (FULL restoration),
to (b) minimal thinning around old trees + burning
(MIN),
(c)
burning
alone
(BURN),
and
(d)
CONTROL. These activities span a broad range of
possible restoration approaches, from a high degree of
mechanical manipulation of forest structure to no
mechanical intervention whatsoever, relying on ﬁre
alone to reduce tree density. After treatments were
completed
in
1999,
forest
structures
had
been
substantially altered (Fule´ et al., 2002a), with the
thinned sites signiﬁcantly lower in tree density and/or
basal area.
Here, we report on re-measurement of permanent
monitoring plots in 2004, the ﬁfth year after treatment,
to assess changes in light of the following expecta-
tions: (1) forest structure would reﬂect higher growth
and lower mortality with decreasing tree density,
while
regeneration
would
show
no
trend,
(2)
abundance of understory vegetation was expected to
increase with decreasing tree density, while composi-
tion would show no trend, and (3) forest ﬂoor and
woody debris were expected to increase with time
since burning. We were interested both in the
dynamics of forest ecosystem change over the ﬁve
years since treatment and in the degree to which
current forest conditions were consistent with pre-ﬁre-
exclusion reference conditions.
2. Study area
We conducted the experiment on a 50-ha site next
to Grandview ﬁre tower in the Tusayan Ranger District
of the Kaibab National Forest, on the border of Grand
Canyon National Park (GCNP), latitude 3585704000N,
longitude 11185702900W. The elevation was approxi-
mately 2290 m with gentle slopes, averaging 7%. Tree
species were ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var.
scopulorum P.&C. Lawson), Gambel oak (Quercus
gambelii Nutt.), Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma
(Torr.) Little), and Rocky Mountain pinyon (Pinus
edulis Engelm.). Soils in GCNP adjacent to the site are
classiﬁed as ﬁne, smectitic, mesic, Vertic Paleustalfs
and Haplustalfs, clay soils weathered from calcareous
sandstone parent material (B. Lindsay, National
Resource Conservation Service, personal communica-
tion, 2000). Average precipitation is 36.8 cm, includ-
ing average annual snowfall of 177.5 cm, at Grand
Canyon Village, approximately 2097 m elevation and
P.Z. Fule´ et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 218 (2005) 129–145

20.4 km NW of the study area (GCNP, 1992).
Temperatures range from an average daily maximum
of 29 8C in July to 8 8C in January. Precipitation varied
substantially in the speciﬁc measurement years of
this study: in the water year (October 1–September
30) 1997, 43.3 cm precipitation (117% of average)
was recorded; in 2000, only 22.4 cm (61% of average)
was recorded; in 2001, 50.2 cm (136% of average) was
recorded; in 2004, 40.6 cm (110% of average) was
recorded. Drought also occurred in 2002, when no data
were collected: 26.2 cm (71% of average) (Western
Regional Climate Center, weather station Grand
Canyon #2, www.wrcc.dri.edu).
Pretreatment measurements were taken in 1997,
followed by thinning and burning in 1999. Post-
treatment measurements were completed in 2000, the
ﬁrst year following treatment, and results were
reported by Fule´ et al. (2002a). Measurements of
understory vegetation only were done in 2001 and
all variables were measured in 2004, the ﬁfth year
following
treatment.
One
CONTROL
plot
was
accidentally burned in 1999; it was removed from
all analyses.
3. Methods
3.1. Field
Each treatment was applied on a 12-ha forested
unit. We established twenty 400 m2 (11.28 m radius)
circular ﬁxed-area plots arranged in a 60 m  60 m
grid in each of the four treatment units. Overstory
trees
taller
than
breast
height
(137 cm)
were
measured on each plot, including species, condition
(living or snag/log classes [Thomas et al., 1979]),
diameter at breast height (dbh), and a preliminary
ﬁeld classiﬁcation of pre- or post-ﬁre-exclusion
origin, were recorded for all live and dead trees over
breast height, as well as for stumps and downed trees
that surpassed breast height while alive. We tallied
regeneration (trees below breast height) by three
height classes (0–40, 40.1–80, and 80–137 cm) on a
nested 100 m2 (5.64 m radius) subplot. We assessed
dwarf mistletoe rating (DMR) on a scale of 0–6 on
each ponderosa pine tree.
We sampled understory vegetation using belt and
point-intercept transects in 1997 (pre-treatment), 2000
(post-treatment), 2001, and 2004. Complete species
lists of all vascular plants and trees <1.4 m in height
were collected in one 10 m  50 m belt transect per
plot. A 50-m point-intercept transect was established
in the center of each belt transect, and species presence
was recorded at a point every 30 cm along each
transect. Plant species were classiﬁed into four groups:
annual and biennial forbs, perennial forbs, grami-
noids, and shrubs. We calculated plant foliar cover (%)
by dividing the number of points containing a plant by
the 166 points per plot. We recorded tree canopy cover
measured by vertical projection (every 30 cm in 1997,
changing to every 3 m in 2004) along the line transect.
Collecting vegetation data using quadrats has been
shown to be a superior method compared to the point-
intercept method in southwestern ponderosa pine
forests (Korb et al., 2003; Abella and Covington,
2004). The point-intercept method tends to over-
estimate
plant
cover
and
underestimate
species
richness. Therefore, in 2004, we additionally sampled
ten 1-m2 quadrats per plot arranged along the center of
the -intercept transect. We measured species presence
and foliar cover (%) for each quadrat. Plant cover was
averaged and species richness was totaled across the
10 quadrats per plot. We continued using belt and
point-intercept transects in 2004 for consistency in
detecting relative changes from pretreatment condi-
tions. We measured dead woody biomass and forest
ﬂoor depth on a 15.2 m planar transect in a random
direction from each plot center (Brown, 1974).
3.2. Laboratory
We carried out statistical analyses of forest
structure and forest ﬂoor variables on the 20 plots
per treatment unit with repeated measures ANOVA.
The 20 plots in each treatment unit were pseudo-
replicates, since only one instance of each experimental
treatment was implemented to the 12 ha units.
Inferences are therefore limited to these particular
sites. Alpha level was 0.05. We transformed variables
(square-root or natural logarithm) where necessary
to meet ANOVA assumptions of normality and
homoskedasticity. Following a statistically signiﬁcant
ANOVA result, we compared treatment means with a
post hoc Tukey’s procedure.
Previously, we had compared pre- and post-
treatment forest structures (Fule´ et al., 2002a). Now,
P.Z. Fule´ et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 218 (2005) 129–145
131

we used post-treatment (2000) data as a covariate
(ANCOVA) to account for differences in forest
structure among treatments, testing whether among-
treatment differences had changed over time. We
used the Kruskal–Wallis/Mann–Whitney test for non-
parametric data (crown scorch, bole char). Fates of
individual large trees (ponderosa pine  37.5 cm dbh,
other species  20 cm dbh) were followed to track
survival, snag creation and retention, and snag loss.
Univariate understory vegetation data from the
three post-treatment years were analyzed with a
repeated measures MANOVA using pre-treatment
data as a covariate. Data from the three post-treatment
years are presented as the difference from pre-
treatment data to account for pre-existing differences.
If signiﬁcant treatment  time interactions occurred,
we used one-way ANOVA and Fisher’s L.S.D. post
hoc tests to compare treatment differences within
years.
Overstory–understory relationships were examined
with linear regression. We modeled plant cover,
species richness, and plant diversity in 1997 (pre-
treatment) and 2004 (ﬁve years post-treatment). We
used step-wise regression to determine the best ﬁtting
models. We introduced 20 independent variables
into the step-wise procedure: tree canopy cover (%),
total basal area, basal area of juniper, pinyon pine,
ponderosa pine, and oak, total tree density, density of
juniper, pinyon pine, ponderosa pine, and oak, litter
depth, duff depth, total forest ﬂoor depth, ﬁne fuels
(1, 10, 100 h), total ﬁne fuels, rotten CWD, and sound
CWD. For analyses of 2004 data, we introduced
three ‘dummy’ variables into the set of independent
variables to determine if the four treatment levels
had a detectable effect on overstory–understory
relationships.
Indicator Species Analysis (ISA; Dufreˆne and
Legendre, 1997) was used to determine most common
species
within
treatment
areas.
We
applied
a
hierarchical approach to determine indicator species:
ﬁrst, we compared treatments, then we compared
years within treatments (FULL in 1997 versus FULL
in 2004). Species were considered indicators of the
treatment and/or year for which they had their largest
indicator value (INDVAL). We restricted our attention
to species with P < 0.05 (assessed using Monte
Carlo randomizations with 999 permutations) and
INDVAL > 25.
We
used
nonmetric
multidimensional
scaling
(NMS) ordinations to illustrate compositional differ-
ences between plots. We conducted ordinations using
PC-ORD
software
(version
4.25;
McCune
and
Mefford, 1999). NMS arranges the plots in a
conﬁguration that minimizes the inter-plot distances
(stress). We used the Bray–Curtis distance measure
with random starting conﬁgurations, 100 runs with
real data, a maximum of 400 iterations per run, and a
stability criterion of 0.00001. A Monte Carlo test with
9999 randomizations was used to determine how
likely the observed stress value of the ﬁnal solution
would be by chance alone. We omitted species that
occurred on <5% of the plots from the ordination and
from analyses of species composition but included
them in univariate analyses of species richness
(McCune and Grace, 2002).
We tested whether the treatments differed from one
another in community composition in 1997, in
community composition in 2004, and we tested for
a time  treatment interaction. Treatment compar-
isons
in
1997
and
in
2004
were
made
with
PERMANOVA software (Anderson, 2005). This
software permits the analysis of univariate or multi-
variate data using any distance measure and linear
model. The calculated statistic (pseudo-F) is calcu-
lated, like a traditional F-statistic, as the sum of the
squared distances among groups divided by the sum of
the squared distances within groups (see, for details,
Anderson, 2001; McArdle and Anderson, 2001). Data
were untransformed and unstandardized. We calcu-
lated dissimilarities using the Bray–Curtis distance
measure (Faith et al., 1987). P-values were calculated
by permuting the observations 9999 times, so no
assumptions of the distributional form of the data were
required.
The test for a time  treatment interaction required
that we account for autocorrelation between repeated
measurements of permanent plots. We accounted for
autocorrelation between repeated measurements by
calculating the multivariate dissimilarity (Bray–Curtis
distance) between the 1997 and 2004 data for each plot
(this is analogous to calculating the difference
between two values in a paired t-test). This calculation
produced a univariate response variable that we
analyzed using a Kruskal–Wallis test and we made
pairwise comparisons with a Wilcoxon two-sample
test; a signiﬁcant result indicatedthat thetreatmentwith
P.Z. Fule´ et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 218 (2005) 129–145
132

greater dissimilarity experienced a greater change in
community composition between 1997 and 2004.
3.3. Analysis of covariance
Data obtained from the quadrats in 2004 could
only be useful if we could account for pre-existing
differences between the treatments in 1997, since no
quadrat data was collected in 1997. To test for
differences among treatments while accounting for
possible pre-existing differences, we used analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA). We analyzed plant cover
differences in 2004 with a covariate of cover from the
point-intercepts in 1997 to represent pre-existing
differences. We analyzed species richness differences
in 2004 with a covariate of species richness from
the belt transects in 1997 to represent pre-existing
differences. We analyzed diversity differences in 2004
with a covariate of diversity from the point-intercepts
in 1997 to represent pre-existing differences. The
covariates were useful in the analyses since they all
covaried with the respective response variables using
data from 2004 (all R2 ranged between 0.10 and 0.50,
all P < 0.01).
4. Results
4.1. Forest structure
As expected, the FULL treatment was signiﬁcantly
lowest in basal area, tree density, and canopy cover in
2004 (respectively, F = 15.1, 21.6, 11.9, P < 0.0001
for all variables) (Table 1). The MIN treatment was
second lowest, though not signiﬁcantly different from
the BURN and CONTROL treatments. Analysis of
covariance showed that the ﬁrst post-treatment forest
structure measurement (2000 data) explained all of the
signiﬁcant differences in forest structure (respectively,
F = 646, 1301, 42, P < 0.0001 for all variables),
indicating that no statistically signiﬁcant changes in
forest structure had occurred between the ﬁrst post-
treatment year (2000) and the ﬁfth (2004).
Basal area, tree density, and canopy cover declined
over the 2000–2004 time period, but the CONTROL
unit consistently had the smallest reduction (Table 1).
The
CONTROL
declined
3.2%
in
basal
area,
compared to 6.2–8.5% in the treatments, and 7.3%
in tree density, compared to 10.6–17.7% in the
treatments. Smaller trees were the most likely to die in
each treatment between 2000 and 2004, as reﬂected in
the consistent increase in quadratic mean diameter for
each species (Table 1). Across all treatments, out of
1764 trees that were alive after treatment in 2000, a
total of 213 trees were dead in 2004 (12.1%). Average
diameters of recently killed trees were lower than
those of surviving trees, signiﬁcantly lower in MIN
and BURN but not in FULL. In the FULL treatment,
dead trees averaged 12.0  4.0 cm (1S.E.) and
living
trees
averaged
16.8  1.5 cm
(U = 530,
P = 0.26). In the MIN treatment, dead trees averaged
7.7  0.7 cm and living trees averaged 12.8  0.5 cm
(U = 11938, P < 0.001). In the BURN treatment, dead
trees averaged 8.0  0.7 cm and living trees averaged
11.5  0.3 cm (U = 38397, P < 0.001).
Trees dying between 2000 and 2004 had sig-
niﬁcantly higher canopy scorch as measured by
percent volume lost. In the FULL treatment, scorch
of dead trees averaged 58  11% (1S.E.) and living
trees averaged 22  3% (U = 509, P = 0.001). In the
MIN treatment, dead trees averaged 58  5% and
living
trees
averaged
33  1%
(U = 10000,
P < 0.0001). In the BURN treatment, dead trees
averaged 62  3% and living trees averaged 32  1%
(U = 49070, P < 0.0001). Scorch height and max-
imum bole char height were signiﬁcantly higher in
dead than living trees in the BURN treatment only.
Dwarf mistletoe rating did not differ between living
and dead trees.
The fates of large trees, deﬁned as ponderosa
pine  37.5 cm dbh and other species  20 cm dbh,
were consistent with the overall declines in tree
variables. Since there were relatively few large trees in
the experiment, the following data are presented in
both absolute numbers and percentages. In the
CONTROL unit, 1 of the 32 large pines (3%) and
none of the 38 large oaks that were alive in 2000 had
died by 2004. One of the ﬁve large pine snags (20%)
but none of the two large oak snags was lost (i.e.,
fallen). In the FULL unit, 1 of 11 large pines (9%) that
were living in 2000 died by 2004. None of the 23 large
oaks died but 2 of the 10 large snags (20%) present in
2000 were lost by 2004. In the MIN unit, there was
change neither to the 14 large pines and 1 large pine
snag nor to the 2 large oaks and 1 large oak snag. The
MIN unit was the only unit to contain large pinyon and
P.Z. Fule´ et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 218 (2005) 129–145
133

juniper trees. There was no change to the one large
living pinyon. Twenty of 21 large junipers, which were
living in 2000, were still living in 2004 (5% mortality)
and all 3 of the large juniper snags present in 2000
persisted in 2004. Finally, in the BURN unit, 2 of 15
large pines that were living in 2000 died by 2004
(13%) and 3 large pine snags persisted in 2004. Two of
32 large oaks died (6%) and the 1 large oak snag
present in 2000 remained unchanged in 2004.
Tree diameter growth differed signiﬁcantly among
treatments and ponderosa pines consistently grew
more than Gambel oaks, but the differences between
treatments did not follow the expected pattern of
higher growth with lower density. Compared to pre-
treatment (1997) values, the MIN unit had the largest
average diameter increment, 1.27 cm, for all trees still
living in 2004 (Table 2). Ponderosa pine diameter
increments were not different in the CONTROL,
FULL, and MIN treatments, but the BURN was
signiﬁcantly lower (F = 9.3, P < 0.0001; Table 2).
Oak diameter increments were signiﬁcantly different
among treatments in an overall anova (F = 3.5,
P = 0.016) but none of the means were separated by
a Tukey’s test. There were too few junipers and
pinyons for testing.
Unlike diameter growth, ponderosa pine basal area
increments differed signiﬁcantly in each treatment
(F = 46.9, P < 0.0001), covering a broad range from
76.6 cm2 in the FULL down to 21.6 cm2 in the BURN
treatment, generally conforming to our hypothesis.
Basal area increment (BAI) was correlated with
diameter increment (range of R = 0.7–0.9) but BAI
provides a better expression of tree growth because it
includes circumference effects. The BURN treatment
had a signiﬁcantly lower basal area increment than the
other treatments (F = 11.0, P < 0.0001). Oak basal

1.4 to 0.9 in CONTROL (36%), 0.3–0.1 in FULL
(67%), unchanged at 0.1 in MIN and 0.01 in BURN.
As expected, tree regeneration (trees shorter than
breast height, 1.37 m) varied widely among treatments
(Table 3) but there were no signiﬁcant differences in
the two shortest height classes (Kruskal–Wallis test,
P = 0.22 for regeneration 0–40 cm in height and
P = 0.72 for regeneration 40.1–80 cm in height).
Gambel oak sprouts comprised 97–100% of regenera-
tion in the shortest height class. There was a signiﬁcant
difference among treatments only in the tallest height
class (Kruskal–Wallis test, P = 0.03), with FULL and
BURN having approximately eight times higher
densities (average of 65 trees ha1 versus average of
8 trees ha1 in MIN and CONTROL).
4.2. Understory vegetation
Changes since treatment were more pronounced in
understory vegetation than in tree structure (Fig. 1),
although all of the changes covaried signiﬁcantly with
pre-existing characteristics (Table 4). Plant cover (%)
in 2004 on the quadrats covaried with cover in 1997 on
point-intercept transects, but plant cover was highest
in FULL in 2004 and not signiﬁcantly different from
MIN. Richness in 2004 on the quadrats covaried with
richness in 1997 on belt transects, but species richness
was highest in FULL and CONTROL and lowest in
BURN in 2004. Diversity in 2004 on the quadrats
covaried with diversity in 1997 on the point-intercept
transects, but diversity (Simpson’s Index, D0) did not
differ among treatments (Table 4).
The
understory
plant
community
responded
strongly to inter-annual climatic differences (Fig. 1),
but there were signiﬁcant treatment effects and
treatment  time interactions for plant cover and
annual species richness (Fig. 1a,b, and e). Change in
cover from 1997 was signiﬁcantly greater in the three
treatments than the control in all three years of re-
measurement, but we did not ﬁnd the expected
differences among treatments (Fig. 1a). Though the
majority of the increases in total cover were due to
native plants, there was a signiﬁcant treatment  time
interaction for exotic plant cover (Fig. 1b). There were
no clear differences of exotic plant cover among
treatments, but the FULL treatment yielded greater
change in all three years of re-measurement. Change
in species richness was lowest in the BURN treatment
across all years but the other treatments did not differ
from the control (Fig. 1c). Change in exotic species
richness did not differ among treatments (Fig. 1d).
Greater change in annual species richness occurred in
the FULL and MIN treatments (Fig. 1e). Change in
plant diversity (Simpson’s Index) was highest in the
FULL treatment in 2000 but was not different than the
control and there were no differences in any other year.

Analysis
identiﬁed
species
that increased in particular treatments since pre-
treatment (Table 5) and explains which species are
driving the differences illustrated in the ordination
(Fig. 2). Indicator species of treatment units were
not included in Table 5 since they indicate pre-
existing treatment unit differences rather than real
changes over time due to treatment. Three of the ﬁve
indicators of FULL in 2004 and ﬁve of the eight
indicators of MIN in 2004 were annual or biennial
species (Table 5).
Understory

were
signiﬁcantly
related to forest structure and fuel loads prior to
treatment. Plant cover was positively related to oak
basal area, and negatively related to pine density and
tree canopy cover (R2

richness was positively related to oak basal area,
and negatively related to pine density and rotten

negatively related to pine density and tree canopy

relationships weakened or became absent entirely.

Fig. 2. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination of species composition on experimental plots in the Kaibab National Forest.
The greatest compositional change occurred on the FULL and MIN restoration plots, as shown by the lines connecting the centroids (average
position within each treatment-year) of treatments among years. This plot was conﬁgured using presence of 83 species on 79 plots in 1997 and 79
plots in 2004. The ﬁnal solution had two-dimensions; stress = 21.6; P = 0.0099.

Plant cover and species richness remained negatively
related to pine density, but the relationships were much
weaker (R2
a = 0.12, 0.15, respectively, both P < 0.01).
Diversity was not correlated with any variable in 2004.
The introduction of ‘dummy’ variables to represent
treatments did not improve the models.
4.3. Forest ﬂoor and woody debris
Duff depths were signiﬁcantly lower in the FULL
and MIN treatments in 2004 (F = 8.2, P < 0.0001)
(Table 6). The post-treatment (2000) duff depth was a
signiﬁcant covariate (F = 10.9, P = 0.0014) but did
not change the pattern of differences by treatment in
2004. Although total woody debris varied over a wide
range, from 5.4 Mg ha1 in BURN to 15.9 Mg ha1 in
CONTROL, the differences were not statistically
signiﬁcant (F = 2.7, P = 0.052).
5. Discussion
5.1. Forest dynamics
Five years after thinning and burning treatments in
ponderosa pine–Gambel oak forest, changes in forest
structure were relatively minor. The predominant
changes were in tree growth, generally following the
expected pattern of higher growth in less dense forests,
mortality of small and ﬁre-damaged trees, and
understory vegetation responses that were highly
correlated with pretreatment patterns (Fig. 3). Since
the experiment was unreplicated, inferences about
signiﬁcant differences in response variables among
treatments are limited to the study sites. However, the
pretreatment similarity of the units, the before–after
control–impact (BACI) design, and the fact that the
treatment impacts were not subtle, support relatively
strong causal inferences about variables that were
directly affected by tree cutting and burning such as
tree structure and forest ﬂoor variables. Weaker
inferences about causation would be more appropriate
for understory vegetation variables, which were
linked more closely to pre-existing conditions. These
inferential distinctions were carried through the
analysis, where tree and forest ﬂoor variables were
compared directly across treatments while understory
vegetation variables included pretreatment conditions
as covariates.
We found that basal area increment in ponderosa
pines was associated with the degree of thinning,
although radial increment was similar across all but
the MIN treatment. Skov et al. (2005) showed that
radial ponderosa growth rate, expressed as a propor-
tion of pretreatment growth rate, varied with degree of

thinning as well as interannual precipitation and
tree age. Younger trees grew signiﬁcantly faster and
responded more strongly to thinning than older
trees; Skov et al. (2005) suggested that a residual
threshold of 16.0 m2 ha1 was needed before
older trees would respond. The FULL and MIN
treatments at Grandview fell below this threshold but
the data set contained too few trees for a comparison
between young and old trees. However, the fact that
basal area increment was signiﬁcantly highest in the
heavily thinned FULL treatment suggests that the
larger tree size was important: since average radial
growth per tree was similar in all treatments except
BURN, the expression of that growth over the
larger trees in FULL led to a higher basal area
increment.
Physiological explanations of increased growth
following restoration thinning and burning were
studied at the Gus Pearson Natural Area near Flagstaff
in northern Arizona, about 100 km southeast of the
Grandview study site. Under conditions of reduced
tree competition and increased soil moisture due to
thinning from 34.5 to 13.0 m2 ha1, presettlement
trees exhibited higher predawn water potential,
stomatal conductance, leaf nitrogen concentration,
higher resin ﬂow, and tougher foliage than paired trees
in the control area (Feeney et al., 1998; Stone et al.,
1999). These conditions persisted for seven years
(Wallin et al., 2004). Skov et al. (2004) compared
physiological responses at nearby sites across a range
of thinning intensities, ﬁnding that increased predawn
water potential was a consistent effect of treatment but
stomatal conductance and net photosynthetic rate
were signiﬁcantly affected only under dry conditions;
young trees displayed greater positive responses to
thinning and burning treatments than older trees.
We expect that similar changes in physiological and
morphological characteristics would have been asso-
ciated with the increased ponderosa pine growth in the
FULL treatment at Grandview, with the implication
that these trees would be more drought-, bark beetle-,
and folivore-resistant than similar trees in the more
dense treatment units.
Though
ponderosa
pines
exhibited
relatively
high growth rates in our study, stand level growth
differences were diminished by the smaller variation
in Gambel oak growth. Oaks in the FULL treatment
had the highest basal area increment, but the
difference was not signiﬁcant. Onkonburi (1999) also
found relatively little change in Gambel oak growth
following thinning or burning treatments.
Tree mortality leading to the declines in basal area,
density, and canopy cover across all treatments
between 2000 and 2004 was probably a consequence
of drought in addition to delayed treatment effects.
The below-average precipitation in 2000 and 2002
was especially severe across the Southwest (Cook
et al., 2004). If the decline in these variables in the
CONTROL were considered as a baseline of change
without treatment, then the additional mortality

associated with the treatments would have averaged
6% in basal area and 10% in density.
Delayed tree mortality is common after ﬁre, both
from heat injury and post-ﬁre bark beetle attacks
(McHugh and Kolb, 2003; Wallin et al., 2003). Since
Sackett et al. (1996) traced substantial mortality of
large ponderosa pine trees to cambial girdling, we had
removed fuels from the base of all large trees, except
in the BURN. There were few large trees, so only very
limited evidence suggested that cambial girdling had
some effect by the ﬁfth year after ﬁre: in the FULL and
MIN combined, only one large tree died out of 50
large pines and oaks, while large-tree mortality in the
BURN was only slightly higher, with four large trees
dying out of 47 large pines and oaks. The CONTROL
lost one out of 70 trees. The ﬁndings that delayed
mortality was signiﬁcantly concentrated in smaller
trees and those with higher crown scorch were
consistent with data from other ﬁres in northern
Arizona (McHugh and Kolb, 2003), suggesting that
direct heat damage was probably an important factor
predisposing trees to death. McHugh and Kolb (2003)
reported that consistent ponderosa pine mortality
began around 70% crown scorch and increased
sharply after 80%; we found that 32% of pines with
scorch 70% and 37% of pines with scorch 80%
that were considered alive in 2000 died by 2004.
Understory vegetation dynamics were more com-
plex than tree changes because of the interacting
factors of signiﬁcant pre-existing differences, climate
effects, and treatment effects. FULL and MIN were
highest in cover and FULL was highest in richness in
2004, consistent with ﬁndings at other restoration sites
(Korb and Springer, 2003), but the mean absolute
differences among treatments were small (3% range in
cover, two species range in richness). Pre-treatment
understory conditions were signiﬁcant covariates with
2004 conditions, supporting Vose and White (1991)
observation that post-ﬁre responses were linked to the
pre-ﬁre plant community. Vegetation dynamics fol-
lowed similar patterns across treatments in 2000,
2001, and 2004 (Fig. 1), inﬂuenced in large part by
climate. Nearly all measures declined substantially in
the drought year of 2000, relative to pretreatment
(1997) measurements, then recovered sharply in 2001
and maintained relatively similar patterns in 2004.
Community composition differed among treatments in
both 1997 and 2004, but the scale of overall change
(vectors in Fig. 2) was much greater in the units with
more intensive treatment, FULL and MIN, than in
BURN and CONTROL.
Ruderal annual and biennial forb species that
characterize recently disturbed habitats were more
common in the treated areas. Annual species richness
differences from pretreatment were highest in the
treatments and did not change in CONTROL (Fig. 1e).
The majority (62%) of indicator species of FULL and
MIN in 2004 were annual or biennial forbs (Table 5).
An increase in native annuals after ﬁres has also been
reported on the North Rim of GCNP (Laughlin et al.,
2004; Huisinga et al., in press). Large increases in
exotic species richness and abundance have been
reported in northern Arizona following thinning and

and high-intensity ﬁres on the North Rim of GCNP
were almost exclusively by native plants (Laughlin
et al., 2004; Huisinga et al., in press). Korb et al. (in
press) compared soil seedbanks at Grand Canyon
(minimal human-caused disturbance) with other sites
that had extensive harvesting and grazing histories,
ﬁnding that native species were poorly represented in
seedbanks and disturbed sites had high densities of
exotic seeds. Since the Grandview site had been
heavily harvested in the early twentieth century (Fule´
et al., 2002b), an increase in exotics might have been
expected to immediately follow the treatments. Exotic
richness differences from pre-treatment in the three
burned treatments were higher but not signiﬁcantly
different than CONTROL in 2004, but exotic plant
cover differences from pretreatment averaged +3% in
FULL, which was signiﬁcantly different than BURN
and CONTROL but not MIN. This suggests that exotic
species cover, not exotic richness, is increasing in
FULL at a greater rate than the other treatments. The
ISA identiﬁed two exotics in MIN, Bromus tectorum
and Verbascum thapsus, but no exotics in FULL.
Continued monitoring is warranted, however, given
other studies that have detected large increases in
exotics following thinning and burning.
5.2. Comparison to reference conditions
These
treatments
were
speciﬁcally
aimed
at
ecological restoration (Allen et al., 2002), taking
the historical ecosystem structure, composition, and
function prior to ﬁre-xclusion, harvesting, and other
changes associated with Euro-American settlement
in the late 19th century as the point of reference.
Reference conditions are understood with varying
degrees of certainty, ranging from relatively precise
information about tree structure and ﬁre regime to very
limited information about herbaceous species, wildlife
dynamics, or human effects on the environment
(SNEP, 1996; Swetnam et al., 1999). Here, we assess
the characteristics of the Grandview experiment, ﬁve
years after initial treatment, in terms of our incomplete
knowledge about reference conditions and draw
inferences about the implications for the future
development of these sites.
Forest structural variables, such as basal area and
density, have been widely applied for reference data
because they are important descriptors of forest
condition and because the data are accessible. Pre-
ﬁre-exclusion forest structural conditions can be
reconstructed due to the persistence of long-lived
trees and decay-resistant dead wood (Covington and
Moore, 1994), drawn from early historical surveys
(Moore et al., 2004), measured in relict sites
(Youngblood et al., 2004), or inferred from similar
stands that remain in nearly natural conditions
(Stephens et al., 2003).
At the Grandview site, historical forest conditions
were reconstructed with dendroecological modeling
by Fule´ et al. (2002b) in 1887, the year of the last
surface ﬁre of the frequent-ﬁre regime. Reconstructed
basal area values ranged from 11 to 20 m2 ha1 and
tree densities from 90 to 175 trees ha1. While many
contemporary southwestern forests are considered
excessively dense, the Grandview units fall toward the
lower end of modern densities because of past tree
harvesting, estimated to have averaged 12.6 m2 ha1
of ponderosa pine basal area removed (Fule´ et al.,
2002b). Additionally, in the case of the FULL
treatment,
heavy
dwarf
mistletoe
infestation
(DMR = 5 or 6) in many young ponderosa pine trees
led to their being considered unsuitable for retention
because their lifespan would be short (Hawksworth
and
Geils,
1990).
Only
the
CONTROL,
at
21.9 m2 ha1, slightly exceeded the range of recon-
structed
basal
area;
the
FULL
treatment,
at
5.6 m2 ha1, remained well below the lower range.
In terms of density, all treatments except FULL
(137.5 trees ha1) remained higher than the historical
range. However, the average size of ponderosa pine
trees in 2004 was much smaller than in 1887:
quadratic mean diameters in 2004 ranged from 13.8
to 36.7 cm, highest in FULL, as compared to 47–
53 cm in 1887. In sum, ﬁve years after treatments,
only the FULL treatment is close to the range of
historical variability for density and quadratic mean
diameter, with the MIN and BURN treatments
continuing to support large numbers of small trees.
The FULL treatment poses concerns with respect to
restoration when compared to the reference conditions
for that unit (data for 1887 from Fule´ et al., 2002a):
basal area in 2004 was 5.6 m2 ha1, compared to
13.0 m2 ha1 in 1887 (57% less), ponderosa pine
density was 35.0 pines ha1, compared to 60.0 pine-
s ha1 in 1887 (42% less), and quadratic mean
diameter of ponderosa pine was 36.7 cm in 2004,
P.Z. Fule´ et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 218 (2005) 129–145
142

compared to 41.3 cm in 1887 (11% less). Although
mortality in the FULL unit between 2000 and 2004
was comparable in proportion to the declines in the
other treatments, the effect may be more important
because the unit is already in such an open condition
relative to historical conditions. Finally, regeneration
of ponderosa pine was very limited in FULL,
averaging only 15 pines ha1 with none in the tallest
height class. Counterbalancing these trends is the
ﬁnding of increased growth in FULL. If the current
basal area growth rate were sustained, 0.4 m2 ha1
would be added per year, taking approximately 20
more years to regain the 1887 level. Low regeneration
may not be an obstacle to sustaining the forest as long
as at least a few young trees become established per
decade. Mast et al. (1999) suggested that establish-
ment of a range of 0.4–3.6 trees ha1 decade1 was
adequate to maintain a long-lived ponderosa pine
forest and Bailey and Covington (2002) found that
these levels were met across several restoration sites in
northern Arizona.
Understory vegetation is difﬁcult to assess with
respect to reference conditions, since these are less
well understood for herbaceous plants than for trees.
Three factors were consistent with ecological restora-
tion goals: by 2004, total plant cover was highest in the
treatments with the lowest basal area (FULL and
MIN), total species richness was highest in the FULL
treatment, and there was no signiﬁcant increase in
exotic species richness (though there were modest
increases in exotic plant cover). At relict ponderosa
pine forests on the North Rim of GCNP, exotic species
were rare and total plant cover on point-intercept
transects was slightly higher than that recorded in
FULL and MIN treatments in 2004 (Laughlin et al., in
press); however, understory reference conditions are
highly variable (Gildar et al., 2004) so strict reference
targets are harder to deﬁne for the understory plant
community.
According
to
strong
relationships
between herbaceous production and forest structure
(Moore and Deiter, 1992), we expected to detect
stronger differences in plant cover among treatment
units since they differ in forest density and basal area.
The long-term drought during the study duration may
be hindering a full recovery of herbaceous vegetation
in treated units, so continued monitoring will be
necessary to determine long-term changes among
treatments.
Repeated use of surface ﬁre in the treatment areas is
planned. In the historical ﬁre regime, mean ﬁre
frequency averaged 6.9 year for all ﬁres, 9.5 year for
ﬁres scarring 25% or more of ﬁre-scarred samples in a
study of the landscape surrounding the study site; ﬁres
ceased after 1887 (Fule´ et al., 2003). Future ﬁres are
likely to continue to affect forest ﬂoor variables but
have only minimal effects on tree growth (Peterson
et al., 1994) or mortality because established trees are
highly resistant to ﬁre (Sackett and Haase, 1998),
especially after the fuels that accumulated over an
extended period of ﬁre exclusion have been consumed.
The Society for Ecological Restoration (SER)
developed nine ‘‘attributes of restored ecosystems’’
that
range
from
the
local
site
(maintaining
a
‘‘characteristic assemblage’’ of species, minimizing
non-natives, ‘‘sustaining reproducing populations’’) to
the surrounding environment (‘‘integrated into a larger
ecological matrix’’, resilient to ‘‘normal periodic
stress events’’) and ﬁnally to long-term sustainability
‘‘to the same degree as its reference ecosystem’’ (SER,
2002). Assessing the Grandview treatments according
to the SER criteria, all treatments are currently
dominated by native species and appear to sustain
reproducing populations. None of these small sites are
integrated into a fully natural matrix, being sur-
rounded by forests in varying conditions, fragmented
by roads and powerlines, and subject to recreational
and wildlife use. Based on resistance to crown ﬁre,
discussed
by
Fule´
et
al.
(2002a),
and
growth
differences that are likely associated with resistance
to herbivores (Wallin et al., 2004), we expect that the
FULL treatment is most capable of withstanding stress
factors such as ﬁre, insects, and drought. The FULL
treatment is also most likely to foster a vigorous
understory vegetation response because of the open
canopy structure. However, continued monitoring will
be important to determine whether growth and
regeneration over time will bring the FULL unit
closer to an open pine-oak forest dominated by large
trees, or whether continued mortality may preclude a
return to conditions similar to historical patterns.
