Intermountain West Frequent-fire Forest Restoration
Ecological restoration is a practice that seeks to heal degraded ecosystems by 
reestablishing native species, structural characteristics, and ecological processes.  
The Society for Ecological Restoration International defines ecological restoration  
as “an intentional activity that initiates or accelerates the recovery of an ecosystem  
with respect to its health, integrity and sustainability….Restoration attempts to  
return an ecosystem to its historic trajectory” (Society for Ecological Restoration 
International Science & Policy Working Group 2004).
Most frequent-fire forests throughout the Intermountain West have been degraded 
during the last 150 years. Many of these forests are now dominated by unnaturally 
dense thickets of small trees, and lack their once diverse understory of grasses, sedges, 
and forbs. Forests in this condition are highly susceptible to damaging, stand-replacing 
fires and increased insect and disease epidemics. Restoration of these forests centers on 
reintroducing frequent, low-severity surface fires—often after thinning dense stands—
and reestablishing productive understory plant communities. 
The Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University is a pioneer in 
researching, implementing, and monitoring ecological restoration of frequent-fire forests 
of the Intermountain West. By allowing natural processes, such as low-severity fire, 
to resume self-sustaining patterns, we hope to reestablish healthy forests that provide 
ecosystem services, wildlife habitat, and recreational opportunities.
The Southwest Fire Science Consortium (SWFSC) is a way for managers, scientists, 
and policy makers to interact and share science. SWFSC’s goal is to see the best available 
science used to make management decisions and scientists working on the questions 
managers need answered. The SWFSC tries to bring together localized efforts to develop 
scientific information and to disseminate that to practitioners on the ground through  
an inclusive and open process.

Introduction
Wildfire is part of the landscape in the Southwest. It can be a 
threat to lives and property, but it is also crucial to maintaining 
healthy ecosystems. Forests in the Southwest are adapted 
to fire and many trees can easily survive low-intensity fires 
burning along the forest floor. For example, ponderosa pine 
forests need regular, low-severity fires to remain healthy. Over 
decades without fire on the landscape, fuel loads accumulated 
and facilitated more intense, high-severity fire. Each fire is 
different, and while some burn in ways that increase ecosystem 
resilience, others burn with greater severity than forests are 
adapted to, killing even the toughest trees and threatening lives 
and homes. 
This report is the fifth in a series of annual overviews 
available from the Southwest Fire Science Consortium 
and the Ecological Restoration Institute. The goal of this 
overview is to provide a concise summary of the fire season 
and to facilitate comparison with past fire years. It follows the 
format of past years’ overviews1 and describes the impacts of 
the 11 largest fires in Arizona and New Mexico in 2017 (all 
fires greater than 15,000 acres in the Southwest region). As in 
previous overviews, this report covers: when the fire burned, 
fire management costs, vegetation types, previous burn 
footprints, management objectives, and burn severity, where 
available. The conclusion section summarizes these same 
measures for the large wildfires in the region and touches on 
how these fires burned in proximity to human communities. 
Wildfire Management
Weather, climate, vegetation type, fuel conditions, and 
topography all influence how an individual wildfire burns 
on the landscape and whether it has beneficial effects on the 
landscape. Some fires will leave many unburned patches, 
creating a mosaic burn pattern, whereas others will burn 
more contiguously. Managers can approach each wildfire with 
multiple objectives that range from managing the wildfire for 
public safety to managing the fire to improve natural resources. 
Federal wildland fire management policy states:
“Response to wildland fires is based on 
ecological, social and legal consequences of the 
fire. The circumstances under which a fire occurs, 
and the likely consequences on firefighter and 
public safety and welfare, natural and cultural 
resources, and, values to be protected, dictate the 
appropriate response to the fire.”2
A full range of wildland fire response strategies may be 
employed to meet these objectives, including containing, 
confining, or suppressing the wildfire. The National Incident 
Management Situation Report identifies the percentage of 
each fire managed with a monitor, confine, point protection, 
or suppression strategy. This report compiles these figures to 
better understand how fires were managed in 2017.
Wildland fire management strategies are based on a 
thoughtful and systematic, risk-based approach that considers 
firefighter and public safety, cause of the wildfire, location, 
existing land management plans, availability of resources, 
values at risk, and social factors. Federal policy dictates that 
“initial action on human-caused wildfire will be to suppress 
the fire.”3 The same federal policy allows naturally ignited 
(lightning) wildfires (or parts of wildfires) to be managed 
for resource benefits such as mitigating fuel loads to 
reduce the risk of high severity, enhancing wildlife habitat, 
improving watershed health, and reducing risk to neighboring 
communities. Though multiple strategies are used to manage 
wildfires, it is important to note that federal agencies only 
recognize two types of fires: prescribed fires and wildfire.
The 2017 Fire Season 
In 2017, wildfire burned 609,509 acres (Figure 1), which is 
nearly 90,000 acres more than in 2016 and greater than the 
average for the previous 10 years (593,931 acres). New Mexico 
had less wildfire (196,837 acres) than the 10-year average 
while Arizona had more (412,672 acres). Both states had 
more prescribed fire than the 10-year average (94,457 acres in 
Arizona and 86,644 acres in New Mexico). 
In 2017, wildfires over 100 acres represent 82 percent of the 
total acreage burned by wildfire. Of the 502,295 acres for which 
data is available, managers used full suppression strategies on 
293,042 acres and other strategies on 209,253 acres. This is 
a greater number of acres and a higher percentage of acres 
managed with full suppression strategies than in 2016 (Figure 
2). However, a greater number of acres were managed with 
strategies other than full suppression in 2017 than in 2015, 
2014, or 2013.  
This overview focuses on the 11 largest fires, which includes 
one New Mexico fire: Corral and 10 Arizona fires: Frye, 
Sawmill, Hilltop, Brooklyn, Goodwin, Burro, Hyde, Boundary, 
Snake Ridge, and Lizard (Figure 3). The 11 largest fires in this 
report represent 57 percent of the acres burned by wildfire in 
2017 in the Southwest region. The fires appear in this report 
from largest to smallest. 
Regional Context
The weak La Niña of 2016–2017 ended in February of 2017 
when oceanic and atmospheric indicators of the El Niño-
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) returned to neutral conditions. 
Temperatures were above normal throughout the year. February 
demonstrated how variable Southwest precipitation can be. 
Arizona had about average precipitation, while in New Mexico 
a few large areas received significantly more than average 
precipitation. March was warmer and drier than average 
(except for the northeastern corner of New Mexico). April 
and May had above average precipitation in New Mexico and 
below average in Arizona. June temperatures ranged from 0 to

8 degrees Fahrenheit above normal across much of Arizona 
and New Mexico. By June, the 2017 precipitation totals were 
average or above average across much of the Southwest except 
southern Arizona which was below average. The monsoon 
came comparatively early and brought more consistent 
precipitation to New Mexico. The monsoon in Arizona started 
a little later than usual.  
Weather drove at least part of the greater wildfire activity 
in Arizona compared to New Mexico in 2017. Arizona 
had below-average winter precipitation, above-average 
temperatures, and a later-than-average start to the monsoon. 
In contrast, New Mexico had average to above average spring 
precipitation and an early start to the monsoon season.
 
The Energy Release Component (ERC) is an index that 
estimates potential available energy released per unit area in 
the flaming front of a fire based on the fuel model and live and 
dead fuel moistures. The ERC is often used to track seasonal 
fire danger focused on fuel loading, woody fuel moistures, and 
larger fuel moistures (lighter fuels have less influence and wind 
speed has no influence on ERC). Graphs of ERCs for two 
regions show the 2017 fire season (blue line) in comparison 
to the 10-year average (gray line) and 10-year maximums (red 
line).6 In much of the Southwest, ERCs stayed close to the 10-
year average through most of the year and moved closer to the 
10-year maximum in the fall (Figures 4 and 5).
Data Sources
Management, Objectives, and Cost
The InciWeb website (inciweb.nwcg.gov) provides background 
information on most large fires such as location and start date. 
InciWeb is an interagency information management system 
designed to provide the public with a single source of incident-
related information. Because InciWeb only sporadically reports 
costs, Incident Status Summary (ICS-209) reports were 
collected to document suppression or management costs. These 
costs do not reflect any post-fire costs such as rehabilitation or 
soil stabilization. The cost data from each

fire is collected in a final table at the end of the document. 
Incident Status Summaries also provide “strategic objectives,” 
which briefly describe the desired outcome for the incident, 
high-level objectives, and in some cases strategic benefits. 
Though strategic objectives often change during a fire, review of 
the most common or persistent strategic objectives for each fire 
provides some insight into the overarching management goals. 
Perimeters
Boundaries for each fire were taken from the Geospatial Multi-
Agency Coordination (GeoMAC) archive of fire perimeter 
maps (rmgsc.cr.usgs.gov/outgoing/GeoMAC/). GeoMAC 
also provides perimeters of fires dating back to 2000, which 
provided a historic context for this year’s fires. 
Vegetation 
Basic information about vegetation and topography of burned 
area was available from LANDFIRE (www.landfire.gov). 
LANDFIRE provides nationally consistent, scientifically based 
maps of existing vegetation as well as Vegetation Condition 
Class (VCC). Vegetation Condition Class was formerly referred 
to as Fire Regime Condition Class (FRCC). Vegetation 
Condition Class is a map of how existing vegetation has 
departed from an estimated natural or historic condition. In the 
Southwest, this departure is generally due to fire exclusion, past 
logging, and grazing and results in greater density of trees and 
less healthy conditions. Vegetation Condition Class is a useful 
metric because it integrates information on existing vegetation, 
historic vegetation, and fire regimes into one variable and has 
been used to help determine where to focus restoration efforts. 
The most current VCC maps (2012) were used in this report.
Soil Burn Severity
Soil burn severity maps provide Burned Area Emergency 
Response (BAER) teams a tool to quantify soil impacts and 
assess potential for post-fire erosion (https://fsapps.nwcg.gov/
afm/baer/download.php). In the immediate aftermath of a fire, 
BAER teams perform an emergency assessment of post-fire 
soil conditions based on a combination of field observations 
and remote sensing change detection products derived from 
the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). The dNBR 
measures change in the ratio of near infrared reflected by 
healthy green vegetation to the shortwave infrared reflected 
by bare soil and rock. Most soil burn severity maps have four 
classes: high, moderate, low, and unburned; but some combine 
the last two categories into a “low/unchanged” category. The 
distribution of soil burn severity is included for those fires for 
which it is available both in the individual fire discussions as 
well as in final summary table.
Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after Wildfire 
Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after Wildfire 
(RAVG) maps estimate canopy mortality (www.fs.fed.us/
postfirevegcondition). The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) 
Remote Sensing Applications Center provides RAVG 
analysis as a first approximation of areas that may require 
reforestation treatments because of canopy killed by high-
severity fire. RAVG maps are created for wildfires that burn 
greater than 1,000 acres of forested USFS land or for fires 
where it is requested. The maps are produced by measuring 
the change between a satellite image before and immediately 
after a wildfire using an algorithm called relative differenced 
Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR), which is sensitive to 
vegetation mortality resulting from the wildfire event. The 
RdNBR is derived directly from the dNBR but is more 
sensitive to vegetation mortality than the dNBR. 
While soil burn severity maps and RAVG canopy mortality 
maps use similar satellite change detection methods, they 
measure fundamentally different forest attributes. In many 
areas, canopy mortality and soil burn severity patterns are 
similar. However, in some vegetation types, such as chaparral or 
grass, it is possible for a fire to cause complete canopy mortality 
with little effect on soils. 
Wildland Urban Interface 
Another geospatial dataset that helps put fires in context is 
the location and density of housing, often referred to as the 
wildland-urban interface, or WUI. The Silvis Lab at the 
University of Wisconsin developed a nationwide map of the 
WUI based on U.S. Census data (http://silvis.forest.wisc.edu/
maps/wui/2010/download). The Silvis map uses fairly standard 
definitions of the two main WUI conditions: intermix (one 
or more structures per 40 acres) and interface (three or more 
structures per acre, with shared municipal services).
Caveats
There are important caveats for all the data used in this 
summary. First, the fire information presented here was taken 
from official sources between December 2017 and February 
2018 and may not include updates or revisions. Second, the 
geospatial data used to generate the maps and tables is also 
based on the best available information, but these data have 
errors and uncertainties. For example, the remote sensing data 
used in all these datasets can include errors introduced during 
collection, processing, and interpretation.

structures were damaged or destroyed in the fire, including the 
Webb Peak Lookout Tower. Wildfire management cost $26 
million, or about $536.71 per acre. The per-day cost of the Frye 
Fire was higher than any of the other fires in this review and it 
lasted 31 days longer than any other fire.
Vegetation and Past Fires
The Frye Fire burned through a wide range of vegetation 
types and a complex fuel arrangement from the lower slopes 
to the top of Mt. Graham in the Pinaleño Mountain Range. 
Elevations ranged from 4,000 to 10,000 feet. More than 15,000 
acres (34 percent) were mixed conifer with piñon-juniper (17 
percent), scrub (11 percent), and non-vegetated (10 percent) 
also making a significant amount of the area. Lower elevations 
transition from grass to brush to chaparral. Mid-elevation 
vegetation consisted of juniper, ponderosa pine, and pine/oak. 
Douglas-fir and spruce/fir populated the highest elevations of 
the mountain.
Frye Fire, Arizona
Lightning ignited the Frye Fire on June 7 on Mount Graham 
near Safford, Arizona on the Coronado National Forest. 
The fire burned for 86 days covering nearly 50,000 acres. 
Managers working on the fire opted to use a combination 
of monitor (50 percent), point zone protection (30 percent), 
and full suppression (20 percent). No residences were 
affected by the Frye Fire, though some recreation areas were 
closed. The steep, rugged terrain, along with abundant snag 
hazards made firefighter access difficult and prohibitive in 
some areas. Responders were susceptible to heat illness due 
to excessive heat conditions and ground transportation of 
medical injuries required at least two-hours of travel time 
to a medical treatment facility. The vast majority of the 
69-reported responder illness/injury incidents were generated 
from an onset of Streptococcus (strep throat) during the early 
days of the incident. The incident area contained historic and 
cultural resources and areas of tribal significance. Three minor

Only about one percent of the area burned by the Frye Fire 
had burned in the past 10 years, however, fuels in the Frye Fire 
included large diameter dead standing and down fuels from 
the 14-year-old Nuttall Fire scar. The Frye Fire perimeter 
contained the 2011 and 2013 Marijilda Fires, shared a small 
boundary with the 17-acre 2016 Noon Creek Fire, and 
completely encompassed the area burned by the 2012 Trap 
Peak fire, however only about a third of that 281-acre area 
reburned. Over half of the vegetation within the Frye Fire (62 
percent) was not significantly different from historic conditions 
(i.e., low departure) according to the Vegetation Condition 
Class map.
Fire Severity
RAVG maps identified nearly 6,500 acres (13 percent) 
where the canopy had greater than 90 percent mortality. The 
portion of high canopy mortality by forest type was similar 
to the overall distribution of forest types within the fire with 
mixed conifer (40 percent) and piñon-juniper (18 percent) 
being the predominant vegetation types to lose more than 90 
percent of the canopy. The soil burn severity maps showed 70 
percent of the burn area in the low severity class and only 16 
percent in the two highest severity classes (4 percent high, 12 
percent moderate). The soil burn severity analysis showed a 
disproportionate (81 percent) amount of the highest severity 
class occurring in the mixed conifer community. Some of the 
differences between the RAVG and soil burn severity maps 
may be due to their different emphasis (i.e., canopy versus 
soil impacts). For example, almost none of the grass or scrub 
categories had high severity in the soil maps while the RAVG 
maps recorded over 1,000 acres of the highest severity in these 
vegetation types.

percent) and scrub (38 percent). Smaller areas of conifer-oak 
(10 percent) and piñon-juniper (4 percent) also burned. More 
than half of the vegetation within the Sawmill Fire (63 percent) 
had a moderate departure from historic conditions according to 
the Vegetation Condition Class map. The Sawmill Fire burned 
through an area that has seen several other fires in the last 10 
years, which includes nearly all 1,800 acres affected by the 2010 
Greaterville Fire. In the middle of the Sawmill Fire’s hourglass 
shape was the 2015 Oak Tree Fire. Roughly two-thirds of this 
2,000-acre fire reburned by the Sawmill Fire. The 2012 Empire 
and 2016 Hilton fires (148 and 163 acres) were completely 
within the Sawmill Fire perimeter. In total, approximately 
3,000 acres reburned in the Sawmill Fire. 
Fire Severity
Nearly 33 percent of the fire had greater than 90 percent 
mortality in the RAVG analysis. This was primarily 
concentrated in the western half of the burn area. The eastern 
half had much lower fire severity, and this is where most of 
the 19,500 acres (41 percent) were that experienced little to no 
canopy mortality (<25 percent). The highest mortality areas 
were generally in scrub and grass, which was consistent with 
the vegetation distribution of the entire fire area. Soil burn 
severity maps were not available for this fire. 
Sawmill Fire, Arizona
The Sawmill Fire is the second largest fire in this report, 
consuming 46,991 acres in just 11 days on lands under 
the jurisdiction of Arizona Department of Forestry and 
Fire Management, Bureau of Land Management, and the 
Coronado National Forest. This human-caused fire started on 
April 23 and burned through grass, chaparral, and oak brush 
10 miles southeast of Green Valley, Arizona in Pima County. 
The reported cause was recreational shooting. Dry and windy 
conditions caused the Sawmill Fire to spread quickly. The high 
temperature was 98 degrees, relative humidity was between 
4 and 18 percent, and wind gusts reached 30 mph. These 
conditions continued for much of the week.7 A temporary area 
closure was issued for BLM public lands within Las Cienegas 
National Conservation Area and 412 citizens were evacuated 
from the Rain Valley area. Fire managers used direct attack 
tactics as part of a full suppression strategy on the wildfire. 
Suppression of the Sawmill Fire cost $8.2 million, or about 
$174.50 per acre.

Hilltop Fire, Arizona
The Hilltop Fire was a lightning-caused wildfire that burned 
33,826 acres near Hilltop Lookout in Gila County, Arizona 
on the San Carlos Apache Nation. The fire burned from 
June 25 to August 18 but was declared controlled and put in 
monitor status by the incident command starting on July 19. 
A mixed suppression strategy of monitor (55 percent) and 
full suppression (45 percent) was used in this grass, scrub 
oak, juniper, and ponderosa pine area. Twelve civilians and 12 
responders suffered injuries. Several monsoonal storms passed 
through the area bringing rain to the fire area but the potential 
for new starts remained high due to the high frequency of 
lightning in these storms. The management cost of the fire was 
$15 million, or about $443.45 per acre. Pre-evacuation were 
ordered for the Cedar Creek and Canyon Day communities, 
but evacuations were not required.
Vegetation and Past Fires
The Hilltop Fire mainly burned through piñon-juniper (58 
percent) and conifer-oak (18 percent) forests but also affected 
small areas of ponderosa pine (9 percent), non-vegetated/
developed (6 percent), riparian forest (5 percent), and chaparral 
(3 percent). Ninety-seven percent of the Hilltop Fire was 
identified as low departure from historic conditions according 
to the Vegetation Condition Class map. The area affected 
by the Hilltop Fire had not been burned in the last 10 years; 
however, the 33,000-acre Whitetail Fire burned roughly 2.5 
miles south east of the Hilltop Fire in 2015. 
Fire Severity
Fire severity information was not available for the Hilltop Fire.

Figure 9. Vegetation in the Brooklyn Fire perimeter.
Brooklyn Fire, Arizona
The Brooklyn Fire burned for 20 days from July 7 to July 27 
in Yavapai County, Arizona on the Tonto National Forest and 
the Agua Fria National Monument. This 33,550-acre fire 
was started by lightning and managers responded with a full 
suppression strategy. Control efforts in this grass, shrub, and 
juniper fuel area were aided by direct rain. No civilians were 
evacuated, or structures threatened, although Arizona Public 
Service and Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) 
power transmission lines, occupied range allotments, and 
private land in-holdings lead to the decision to use a full 
suppression approach in this remote, steep, and inaccessible 
terrain. During the second day of the fire, strong gusty winds 
from thunderstorms pushed it in multiple directions and made 
suppression difficult. Suppression cost $1.4 million, or $41.73 
per acre. 
Vegetation and Past Fires
The Brooklyn Fire burned primarily through grass (58 
percent), scrub (18 percent), and chaparral (17 percent), with 
about 1,500 acres of piñon-juniper (5 percent) and not much 
else. Nearly all 3,600 acres that burned in the 2010 Bloody 
Fire were reburned in the 2017 Brooklyn Fire. The area that 
reburned was nearly entirely grassland. Eighty-six percent of 
the Brooklyn Fire was identified as low departure from historic 
conditions according to the Vegetation Condition Class map.
Fire Severity
The Soil Burn Severity data for the Brooklyn Fire indicated 
that all but 141 acres were either low severity (90 percent) or 
unburned/undetected (9 percent).

Vegetation and Past Fires
The Goodwin Fire burned 2,400 acres of ponderosa pine (8 
percent) but was primarily in chaparral (60 percent) and piñon-
juniper (15 percent). The Goodwin Fire reburned 45 acres 
of the 2012 Gladiator Fire. It also shared a small boundary 
with the 2015 SA Hill Fire. Most of the Goodwin Fire was 
identified as close to historic conditions (93 percent) in the 
Vegetation Condition Class Map. 
Fire Severity
RAVG maps identified nearly 16,000 acres (56 percent) 
where the canopy had greater than 90 percent mortality. The 
proportion of high canopy mortality by forest type was similar 
to the overall distribution of forest types in the fire: chaparral 
(64 percent), piñon-juniper (20 percent) ponderosa pine  
(4 percent), and scrub (4 percent). The soil burn severity maps 
showed 74 percent of the burn area in the two highest severity 
classes (24 percent high, 50 percent moderate) and only  
11 percent in the unchanged category. The distribution of 
forest types within the high soil burn severity analysis was 
similar to the RAVG maps. 
Goodwin Fire, Arizona
The Goodwin Fire burned 28,516 acres of dense chaparral and 
ponderosa pine in 16 days between June 24 and July 10 on the 
Prescott National Forest. The cause of this Yavapai County fire 
was not determined. Managers used a full suppression strategy 
because the fire threatened 1,400 residences and necessitated 
the evacuation of 9,000 citizens. Ultimately 17 residences 
were damaged or destroyed along with 19 minor structures. 
Strategic objectives were to protect and minimize threats to 
infrastructure, developed recreational sites, cultural resources, 
threatened and endangered species habitats, and structural 
range improvements. The wildfire cost $15 million to manage, 
or $526.02 per acre. 
An unofficial drone flown over the burn area caused the 
grounding of firefighting air craft on the fifth day of the fire. 
Grounding of aircraft was significant because of the important 
role they played on this fire. Three Very Large Air Tankers 
(VLATs), heavy air tankers, and helicopters worked to reduce 
fire intensity around endangered structures.

Figure 11. Soil burn severity map for the Burro Fire.
Vegetation and Past Fires
The Burro Fire burned through a relatively balanced 
distribution of conifer-oak (28 percent), grass (28 percent), 
scrub (22 percent), and piñon-juniper (19 percent) 
communities with a small amount of riparian forest (2 percent). 
The Burro Fire perimeter contained nearly all of the 785-acre 
2015 Woods Tanker Fire. The remaining 26,500 acres had not 
burned in the previous 10 years.
Fire Severity
Fire severity was generally low in the Burro Fire. RAVG maps 
identified only 658 acres (2 percent) where the canopy had 
greater than 90 percent mortality. About half of these acres 
were in the conifer-oak community. Eighty-eight percent of 
the burn area caused less than 25 percent canopy mortality. 
The soil burn severity maps showed a similar result with nearly 
24,000 (88 percent) in the lowest two severity classes. The soil 
burn severity maps only identified 46 acres as high severity  
and all of these were in a western lobe of the fire. 
Burro Fire, Arizona
The Burro Fire started by an unknown cause on June 30 eight 
miles northeast of Tucson, Arizona on Coronado National 
Forest, state, and private lands. Fire managers chose to evacuate 
350 citizens along the Catalina highway and use a 100 percent 
monitor approach to the Burro Fire. Operational challenges 
included the remote location, lack of road access to the 
majority of the fire, extreme weather conditions, and elevated 
public concerns due to proximity of communities. The strategic 
approach was to protect public, commercial, and recreational 
sites along the Catalina Highway and the communities of 
Summerhaven and Willow Creek until the arrival of a fire-
season-ending rain event. Planning utilized the onset of 
monsoons and on July 9, rain fell on approximately 80 percent 
of the fire. Lighting from the storms also ignited spot fires, 
which crews suppressed. The wildfire was fully contained after 
burning 27,238 acres in 18 days. Management of the wildfire 
cost $8.95 million, or $328.59 per acre.

Corral Fire, New Mexico
The Corral Fire was the only fire more than 15,000 acres in 
New Mexico and therefore the only one highlighted in this 
report. This fire started with a lightning strike on June 4 and 
covered 20,350 acres in Grant County before it was considered 
100 percent contained 39 days later. This low-intensity fire 
on the Gila National Forest was managed with a monitoring 
approach as it worked through grass and juniper on the 
ridge tops with ponderosa pine in the drainage bottoms. The 
strategic objective of this fire was to allow the fire to play its 
natural role in a fire-adapted ecosystem. The cost to manage 
the fire was $750,000, or about $36.86 per acre. 
Vegetation and Past Fires
The Corral Fire primarily burned through piñon-juniper (47 
percent) and ponderosa pine (29 percent) with conifer-oak 
(8 percent) and grass (7 percent) also making up significant 
acreage. The two largest fires to affect the Corral Fire area in 
the last 10 years were the 2009 and 2015 Moore Fires, both 
were approximately 4,000 acres. One 800-acre area in the 
center of the Corral Fire was burned by all three fires. The 
unburned notch in the south western edge of the Corral Fire 
was likely associated with the 2015 Moore Fire perimeter. 
Most of the Corral Fire was identified as close to historic 
conditions (85 percent) in the Vegetation Condition Class map.
Fire Severity
Fire severity was generally low in the Corral Fire. RAVG maps 
identified less than 250 acres (1 percent) where the canopy had 
greater than 75 percent mortality. Similar, to the burn area as a 
whole, these limited acres of high severity were predominantly 
in piñon-juniper and ponderosa pine communities. The soil 
burn severity data also showed a relatively low-severity fire with 
zero acres designated as high severity and only 311 (2 percent) 
identified as moderate severity.

Hyde Fire, Arizona
A lightning strike started the Hyde Fire on July 11 in the 
Prescott National Forest near Williamson Valley, Arizona. 
After 30 days, it encompassed 18,072 acres. A monitoring 
strategy was used to approach this fire allowing management 
for multiple resource objectives. This decision was made 
in part because the Hyde Fire burned in a remote area and 
started at a time when intermittent rains are more common. 
Other fires that were treated with a more aggressive approach 
started earlier in summer and burned during the hottest and 
driest periods of the year or were immediately adjacent to 
communities. There were no evacuations or structures affected 
by the fire. The cost for managing the Hyde Fire was $500,000, 
or about $27.67 per acre. 
Vegetation and Past Fires
The Hyde Fire mainly burned through piñon-juniper (58 
percent), ponderosa pine (19 percent), and conifer-oak (10 
percent) forests but also affected small areas of chaparral, grass, 
riparian forest, and scrub. Eighty-eight percent of the Hyde 
Fire was mapped as low departure from historic conditions. 
The only fire to burn this area in the last 10 years was a 235-
acre fire in 2009 also named Hyde. 
Fire Severity
More than 99 percent of the 18,000-acre fire exhibited little to 
no canopy mortality. Only 23 acres had more than 25 percent 
canopy mortality in the RAVG map. Those acres were almost 
all in the piñon-juniper community. Soil burn severity maps 
were not available for this fire.

Boundary Fire, Arizona
The Boundary Fire burned for 32 days, from June 1 to July 3, 
and covered 17,788 acres in Coconino County, Arizona on the 
Kaibab and Coconino national forests. This fire was caused 
by a lightning strike and was managed with a combination of 
monitor (5 percent), confine (35 percent), point zone protection 
(25 percent) and suppression (35 percent) strategies. The 
Boundary Fire was partially within the Kendrick Mountain 
Wilderness, which features steep, rugged terrain and presented 
considerable firefighter safety concerns due to topography, fuels, 
and the potential for rapid fire growth. Primary fuels included: 
timber (litter and understory), short grass (1 foot), and heavy 
logging slash. Some areas featured heavy dead and down debris 
from the Pumpkin Fire in 2000.
The described strategy was to utilize a values-driven approach 
that incorporated a mix of tactics (point protection, direct 
and indirect) when and where the probability of success was 
high and the risk is acceptable in relationship to the values. 
The planned end-state was that the fire burned in ponderosa 
pine, dry mixed-conifer, aspen and pinyon-juniper with 
mixed severity, including areas of moderate to high severity. 
The goal was to protect private land and infrastructure from 
fire and post-fire impacts. Noted considerations included 1) 
lower average fuel loading in the Kendrick Mountain area; 
2) maintain habitat for the Mexican spotted owl, peregrine 
falcon, and other wildlife; and 3) minimize impacts on private 
property, cultural and historic resources, wilderness character, 
aspen enclosures, and livestock forage. Managers used aerial 
ignitions to protect values at risk and increase the amount of 
backing fire.
No structures were damaged during the Boundary Fire; 
however, 13 civilians were evacuated, four of which had 
injuries. The cost for managing the Boundary Fire was $9.4 
million, or about $528.45 per acre. Two reasons the Boundary 
Fire may have had a high per-acre cost were its long duration 
(32 days) and aerial ignitions.
Vegetation and Past Fires
The most common vegetation type within the Boundary Fire 
footprint was ponderosa pine (56 percent), with mixed conifer 
(26 percent) also accounting for a significant portion of the 
area. Based on the Vegetation Condition Class map, nearly 
two-thirds (65 percent) of the vegetation within the Boundary 
Fire was significantly different from historic conditions (i.e., 
high departure). The Boundary Fire shared two boundaries 
with the 2009 Wildhorse Complex Fire equaling roughly three 
Figure 14. Soil burn severity map of the Boundary Fire.

Ecological Restoration Institute
2017 Wildfire season: an overview / southwestern u.s. 15
total miles. The fire expanded past the Wildhorse Complex 
Fire perimeter on the longer of the two shared boundaries and 
lead to about 315 acres reburning. The Boundary Fire also 
shared a half-mile border with the 2015 Kendrick Fire on the 
east. Despite the roughly 3.5 miles of shared boundaries, only 
about 2 percent of the Boundary Fire had been burned in the 
last 10 years.
Fire Severity
The soil burn severity maps showed only 3 percent of the burn 
area in the highest severity class. Sixty-three percent of the area 
was in low (51 percent) or unchanged (12 percent) category. The 
RAVG data indicated even lower fire severity with more than 
75 percent of the burn area having less than 25 percent canopy 
mortality. According to the RAVG data, around 1,500 acres 
(8 percent) showed greater than 90 percent canopy mortality. 
Ponderosa pine was the dominant vegetation type (56 percent) 
in the Boundary Fire but it made up a disproportionate amount 
of the highest canopy mortality (84 percent).

Snake Ridge Fire, Arizona
Lightning started the Snake Ridge Fire on May 19 and it 
continued to burn until July 13. During those 55 days, it burned 
15,333 acres on the Coconino National Forest. This fire was 
managed with a combination of monitor (25 percent), confine (25 
percent), point zone protection (25 percent) and full suppression 
(25 percent) strategies. After preparing a perimeter to contain the 
wildfire, managers used ignitions to secure the perimeter, reduce 
long-term smoke impacts, and minimize adverse fire effects 
to Western Area Power Administration power lines, critical 
wildlife habitat, and soil, watershed, and cultural resources. The 
overarching strategic objective from ICS-209 was to use fire 
to reduce fuel accumulations, reduce future risks, reintroduce 
fire back into the planning area, and improve ecosystem health. 
Managers worked to keep wildfire out of timber sales and private 
property while also minimizing smoke impacts to highways and 
residence in Verde Valley. The management cost of the wildfire 
was $1 million, or $65.22 per acre.
Vegetation and Past Fires
The Snake Ridge Fire burned through an area that was 
86 percent ponderosa pine. Riparian forest (7 percent) and 
grassland (3 percent) were the only other vegetation types 
accounting for more than 250 acres. Based on the Vegetation 
Condition Class map, most of the vegetation within the 
Snake Ridge Fire (78 percent) was significantly different from 
historic conditions (i.e., high departure). The Snake Ridge 
Fire shared boundaries with two 2009 fires. It shared a 3.4-
mile perimeter with the 4,000-acre Brady Fire and a 2.2-mile 
perimeter with the 3,000-acre Bow Fire. Despite the lengthy 
shared perimeters, less than 1 percent of the Snake Ridge Fire 
had been burned in the last 10 years. The Snake Ridge Fire 
contained all of the 100-acre 2013 Wild Horse Fire.
Fire Severity
Fire severity was generally very low in the Snake Ridge Fire. 
RAVG maps identified less than 250 acres (2 percent) where 
the canopy had greater than 25 percent mortality. Nearly all 
this canopy mortality was in ponderosa pine communities in 
the northern lobe of the fire. Eighty-three percent of the area 
showed no canopy mortality. Soil burn severity data was not 
available for this fire.

Lizard Fire, Arizona
The Lizard Fire was reported on June 7 near Dragoon, 
Arizona. This fire predominantly burned through short grass 
and brush on the Coronado National Forest. This area features 
rough terrain on the south and limited access on the west 
side. Fifty citizens were evacuated as the fire burned north 
and west toward homes, and fire managers responded with 
a full suppression strategy. The wildfire burned for 15 days 
and covered 15,230 acres. The wildfire cost $5.876 million to 
manage, or about $385.82 per acre.
Vegetation and Past Fires
The area burned by the Lizard Fire had not been burned by 
any other fires in the previous 10 years. The majority of the 
Lizard Fire was scrub (26 percent), conifer oak (26 percent), 
grass (22 percent), or piñon-juniper (15 percent) with portions 
of chaparral (5 percent). Roughly half (47 percent) of the 
Lizard Fire showed low departure from historic vegetation 
and most of the rest (49 percent) was classified as moderate 
departure.
Fire Severity
The RAVG maps indicate that nearly 91 percent of the fire 
burned with little impact on the overstory canopy (less than 
25 percent mortality). Canopy damage was most significant 
in the southern and central portion of the Lizard Fire, with 
approximately 200 acres having greater than 90 percent 
canopy mortality. Soil burn severity maps were not available 
for this fire.

Conclusion
This report covers the 11 largest wildfires of 2017 and half 
of the acreage burned in the Southwest. Piñon-juniper was 
the most commonly burned vegetation type and made up 
21 percent of the area analyzed in this report (Figure 17). 
Fewer acres of ponderosa pine burned in the largest wildfires 
of 2017, while more acres of chaparral, scrub, and grassland 
burn burned in 2017 compared to the largest wildfires of the 
previous four years.
Soil burn severity maps analyzed in this report account for only 
28 percent of the total acres burned in 2017 (56 percent of the 
11 largest fires). For the six fires in this report with soil burn 
severity maps, 77 percent of the the acres burned with low or 
very low soil burn severity (Figure 18). Roughly 10,000 acres  
(6 percent) of this area experienced high soil burn severity. 
More than 70 percent of the high soil burn severity acres in 
this report were from the Goodwin Fire.
RAVG maps were available for nine fires in this analysis and 
show the majority (63 percent) of acres analyzed were less 
than 25 percent canopy mortality (Figure 19). Seventeen 
percent of the area analyzed burned with greater than 90 
percent canopy mortality. The Goodwin and Sawmill fires 
account for 78 percent of the highest canopy mortality areas. 
It is worth noting that these two fires mainly burned in 
low-stature vegetation (grass, scrub, chaparral), so canopy 
mortality is likely less ecologically significant.
Only 13 percent of the area in this analysis was highly 
departed from historic conditions based on the LANDFIRE 
vegetation condition class maps (Figure 20). It is reasonable 
to assume that the high proportions of wildfires burning with 
low severity and the high portion of the area burned close to 
the historic condition are related. The Boundary and Snake 
Ridge fires make up 57 percent of the area burned that was 
highly departed from historic conditions. The Sawmill Fire had 
the third most highly departed acres and featured more than 
15,500 acres with greater than 90 percent canopy mortality.

Three structures were damaged in the Frye Fire, while 17 
residences were damaged or destroyed along with 19 minor 
structures in the Goodwin Fire. Evacuations were required for 
the Sawmill, Goodwin, Burro, Boundary, and the Lizard Fire. 
Pre-evacuations were called for Hilltop, but no evacuation 
was necessary. 
Past fires played a role in most fires in this analysis except the 
Hilltop and Lizard Fires. However, in many cases the area 
reburned within 10 years was small (e.g., 1 percent in the  
Frye Fire).  
The 11 fires in this analysis cost more than $92 million 
dollars to manage (with a range of strategies) for an average 
of $302 per acre. As noted above, managers identify the most 
appropriate strategy for each part of a wildfire to minimize 
threats and maximize positive outcomes. Using the percentage 
of strategies reported in the ICS-209 forms allows a portioning 
of acres and costs by the strategy used. In 2017, managers used 
full suppression strategies on 58 percent of the acres burned 
in fires over 100 acres and other strategies on remaining 42 
percent of the acres.
