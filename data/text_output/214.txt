Abstract
Remote ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, USA provide
valuable examples of reference conditions due to their relatively uninterrupted ﬁre regimes, limited grazing history, and
protection from logging. Wildﬁre is an important disturbance agent in upland forests of the Interior West, yet repeated
measurements taken before and after lightning-ignited ﬁres are rare. In 1999, a low-severity Wildland Fire Use ﬁre burned
156 ha on Fire Point, a peninsula dominated by old-growth ponderosa pines, which had not burned for at least 76 years. We
measured understory plant community and forest ﬂoor characteristics in 1998 (1 year before the ﬁre) and 2001 (2 years after the
ﬁre) at this site and at nearby reference sites that did not burn in 1999 but have had continuing ﬁre regimes throughout the past
century. After the wildﬁre, the plant community at Fire Point shifted toward higher compositional similarity with the reference
sites. Analysis of functional group composition indicated that this change was due primarily to an increase in annual and biennial
forbs. Gayophytum diffusum, Polygonum douglasii, Chenopodium spp., Solidago spp., Elymus elymoides, Calochortus nuttallii,
Hesperostipa comata, and Lotus spp. were indicative of forests inﬂuenced by recent ﬁres. Species richness, plant cover, plant
layer density and plant diversity were signiﬁcantly lower at Fire Point than at the reference sites, possibly due to long-term ﬁre
exclusion, but the ﬁre did not increase the rate of change in these variables after 2 years. Few exotic species were present at any
site. Forest ﬂoor depths at Fire Point were reduced to depths similar to the reference sites, primarily due to consumption of the
duff layer. There was a signiﬁcant inverse relationship between the ratio of duff:litter and species richness. Compared to ﬁre-
excluded forests, old-growth ponderosa pine forests inﬂuenced by low-intensity surface ﬁres generally have greater plant species
richness (especially annual forbs) and lighter fuel loads. This study supports the continued application of the Wildland Fire Use
strategy in old-growth montane forests to maintain and improve forest health by altering understory species composition and
reducing fuel loads.

understanding of wildﬁre effects on forest structure
and composition. The effects of stand-replacing ﬁres
on herbaceous communities are well documented
(e.g. Crawford et al., 2001; Grifﬁs et al., 2001), but
the beneﬁts of low-severity wildﬁres on community
composition have received little attention. Ponderosa
pine forests in the southwest have been signiﬁcantly
altered since Euroamerican settlement. A variety of
factors, including overgrazing (Savage and Swetnam,
1990; Savage, 1991), logging, a favorable climate for
pine regeneration (Savage, 1991; Savage et al., 1996),
and management practices such as ﬁre suppression,
interacted to cause tremendous increases in tree den-
sity and fuel loads and reductions in species richness
and plant cover (Cooper, 1960; Covington and Moore,
1994a,b; Mast et al., 1999; Allen et al., 2002). Land
managers are increasingly interested in managing
wildﬁres under the strategy of Wildland Fire Use to
restore degraded forests (Brown et al., 1994; Miller,
2003), but require ‘base datum’ (Leopold, 1941)
information on presettlement conditions and wildﬁre
effects to guide management decisions. The preset-
tlement era is a widely accepted reference point for
southwestern ponderosa pine forests because it repre-
sents the range of historical ‘natural variability’
(Landres et al., 1999; Fule´ et al., 2002) at a time
when critical ecosystem processes, particularly a
frequent, low-intensity ﬁre regime, had not been
altered by Euroamerican settlers (Agee, 1993; Swet-
nam and Baisan, 1996; Fule´ et al., 1997; Moore et al.,
1999).
Dendrochronological
methods
can
examine
extant evidence of overstory structure and ﬁre his-
tory to determine overstory reference conditions
(e.g. Fule´ et al., 1997, 2003). The overall conclusion
from these studies and from historical accounts (e.g.
Woolsey, 1911) is that presettlement forests in the
southwest were dominated by an overstory of
clumped old-growth ponderosa pines and were
subject to frequent low-intensity surface ﬁres. Less
information is available concerning understory
reference
conditions.
Historical
accounts
and
early photographs suggest that the understory in
southwestern ponderosa pine forests was a diverse
bunchgrass-dominated community (Beale, 1858;
Rusby, 1889; Merriam, 1890). Currently, ﬂoristic
diversity and vegetation density are reduced relative
to presettlement times, though these changes are
difﬁcult to quantify (Arnold, 1950; Covington
and Moore, 1994a,b), in part because non-woody
material decays rapidly. Therefore, the study of
understory reference conditions requires different
approaches than can be used for the overstory. These
approaches have included modeling of overstory–
understory relationships (Covington and Moore,
1994b; Naumburg and DeWald, 1999), phytolith
analysis (Kerns et al., 2001), and quantifying the
ecosystem characteristics of relict sites (Gildar
et al., 2004). In southwestern ponderosa pine for-
ests, relict sites generally contain old-growth trees,
have experienced little grazing by domestic live-
stock (Belsky and Blumenthal, 1997), and have
relatively uninterrupted ﬁre regimes (Fule´ et al.,
2003).
Analyses of wildﬁre effects are rare because it is
difﬁcult to study random events with robust, repli-
cated experiments (van Mantgem et al., 2001).
Therefore, most studies of ﬁre effects in ponderosa
pine forests have focused on prescribed burns that are
more easily controlled and manipulated (e.g. Harris
and Covington, 1983; Armour et al., 1984; Andariese
and Covington, 1986). However, wildﬁres (including
Wildland Fire Use ﬁres) differ from prescribed burns
in timing, intensity, and size. Wildland Fire Use is the
management of naturally ignited wildland ﬁres to
improve forest health and resources in ﬁre-adapted
ecosystems (Miller, 2003). Knowledge about the
effects of Wildland Fire Use ﬁres would greatly
increase our understanding of the role of ﬁre in
ponderosa pine forests and would help guide man-
agement decisions. Moreover, data on wildﬁre effects
from relict sites would be especially valuable since
these ﬁres would represent effects akin to presettle-
ment processes.
The objectives of this study were to compare an
old-growth ponderosa pine forest that has experi-
enced long-term ﬁre exclusion with a broad range of
reference sites that have experienced a relatively
undisrupted ﬁre regime throughout the past century.
Measurements were made before and after a low-
severity ﬁre. Analyses were conducted on the
understory vegetation (at the community, functional
group, and species levels), and on forest ﬂoor char-
acteristics. On the basis of these results, we present
inferences about ﬁre’s role in structuring understory
communities and reference conditions.

2. Methods
2.1. Study sites
This study was conducted at the southern extent of
the Kaibab Plateau at three remote locations on the
North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP):
Fire Point, Powell Plateau, and Rainbow Plateau
(Fig. 1). All three sites are dominated by ponderosa
pine, Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), and New Mex-
ico locust (Robinia neomexicana). Total basal area
was approximately 30 m2/ha across all sites (Fule´
et al., 2002). Common herbaceous species at the sites
include Poa fendleriana, Carex geophila, Lupinus
hillii, Eriogonum racemosum, and Antennaria parvi-
folia. Elevations range from 2225 to 2340 m. Soils
have been tentatively classiﬁed as Typic Paleustalfs
and were derived from Kaibab limestone. These for-
ests have never been commercially harvested (Warren
et al., 1982). Evidence exists for limited livestock
grazing on the Kaibab Plateau as early as 1871 (Wood-
bury, 1944) and signiﬁcant cattle grazing by 1885
(Rasmussen, 1941). However, cattle and sheep grazing
essentially ceased in GCNP in the mid-1930s, when a
fence was built along the northern boundary of the
park to exclude domestic animals. Rasmussen (1941:
253) described the ponderosa pine forests of the
Kaibab Plateau as open with ‘‘sunlight reach[ing]
the ground in almost all parts of the forest’’.
Average annual precipitation at the Bright Angel
ranger station (elevation 2564 m) is 63.7 cm. Average
daily temperatures range from a maximum of 25.2 8C
in July to a minimum of 8.3 8C in January (Western
Regional Climate Center, www.wrcc.dri.edu). 1998
was wetter than average while 2001 was drier than
average. In 1998, late winter (January–March) pre-
cipitation totaled 35.0 cm (133% of the recorded
average precipitation in these months from 1948 to
2003) and early growing season (April–July) precipi-
tation totaled 15.9 cm (129% of average). In 2001, late
winter (January–March) precipitation totaled 21.7 cm
(83% of average) and early growing season (April–
July) precipitation totaled 9.4 cm (76% of average).
The study sites are approximately 280 m lower than
the weather station and therefore were slightly warmer
and drier than the station.
Surface ﬁre regimes on the North Rim were inter-
rupted after 1879 (Fule´ et al., 2003). Prior to 1880, ﬁre
frequency at all three sites ranged from 3.0 to 8.9
years. Most ﬁres occurred relatively late in the grow-
ing season. Since 1879, ﬁre frequency was reduced on
Rainbow and Powell Plateaus, but each experienced
three large ﬁres and several smaller ﬁres. Large ﬁres
occurred on Powell Plateau in 1892, 1924, and 1987
and on Rainbow Plateau in 1900, 1985, and 1993 (see
Fule´ et al. (2003) for dates of small ﬁres). These
relatively uninterrupted ﬁre regimes are highly unu-
sual in the southwest (Swetnam and Baisan, 1996);
therefore, these sites may have retained key elements
of ‘wildness’ or ‘naturalness’ (Fule´ et al., 2002). On
Fire Point, in contrast, the only large ﬁre between 1879
and 1999 occurred in 1923. All of the recording trees
that detected this ﬁre were located in the western half
of the study area, suggesting that the eastern half of
Fire Point did not burn between 1879 and 1999. The
three southern-most plots on Fire Point may have also

burned in the ‘Muav’ ﬁre of 1989. On 2 September
1999 a wildﬁre (the ‘Boundary’ ﬁre) was ignited by
lightning on Fire Point. The low-intensity ﬁre was
declared a Wildland Fire Use ﬁre (hereafter, ‘wild-
ﬁre’) and was assisted by the National Park Service. It
burned a patchy mosaic across 156 ha of the peninsula
and was declared out on 12 December 1999. On
average, this ﬁre reduced ponderosa pine basal area
by <1 m2/ha (A. Green, unpublished data).
2.2. Data collection
Permanent plots arranged on a systematic 300 m
grid were established in 1998 in GCNP to study forest
structure, composition, and ﬁre histories across an
elevational gradient (for details, see Fule´ et al.,
2002, 2003). This study focuses on the ﬁfteen plots
at Fire Point and six plots at each of Rainbow and
Powell Plateaus. All gridded plots on Rainbow and
Powell Plateaus were measured in 1998 but 12 plots
were remeasured in 2001 and were chosen to represent
a range of topographic positions (Gildar et al., 2004).
Low sample sizes inhibited rigorous testing of plot
independence, but we found no evidence for spatial
autocorrelation of plots separated by at least 300 m
with
Moran’s
I-test.
Each
plot
was
0.1 ha
(20 m  50 m) in size and was oriented with the
50 m sides uphill–downhill to maximize sampling
variability along the elevational gradient. Plot corners
and centers were permanently marked with 30 cm iron
stakes sunk ﬂush to the forest ﬂoor and the distance
and bearing from a tagged reference tree to the center
of the plot was recorded.
Understory vegetation and forest substrates were
sampled using belt and point intercept transects.
Complete
species
lists
were
collected
in
two
10 m  50 m belt transects per plot. Each species
occurred on zero, one, or two belt transects per plot;
these data were used for the analysis of community,
functional group, and species responses. We lumped
species to the generic level when vegetative charac-
teristics were insufﬁcient to warrant a species-level
identiﬁcation;
for
example,
‘Chenopodium
spp.’
includes C. fremontii, C. berlanderii, and possibly
others; ‘Lotus spp.’ includes L. utahensis, L. wrightii,
L. plebius, and hybrids; and ‘Solidago spp.’ includes S.
canadensis, S. velutina and perhaps others. Botanical

Conservation Service, 2004.
A 50 m point intercept transect was established in
the center of each belt transect, and species presence
and forest ﬂoor substrates (soil, litter, rock, wood)
were recorded every 30 cm along each transect (166
points per transect). We summed the data from the two
transects per plot, yielding a total of 332 points per
plot. Percent cover estimates for each plant species
(foliar cover) and substrate were calculated by divid-
ing the number of points containing that attribute by
the 332 points per plot. All vascular plant species
shorter than breast height (1.37 m tall), including trees
and shrubs, were included in the analysis. Shannon’s
H0 index of plant diversity was calculated from point
intercept data. Overstory canopy cover measured by
vertical projection (Ganey and Block, 1994) was
recorded along the point intercept transect. Plant layer
densities were calculated by averaging the number of
plants (layers of plants) detected at each point where at
least one plant was recorded.
Forest ﬂoor characteristics (litter and duff depth)
were measured on three permanent 15.24 m (50 ft)
planar transects per plot using the method outlined in
Brown (1974). The litter layer (Oi) is composed of
freshly fallen organic material, and the duff layer
(Oe þ Oa) is the combined fermentation and humus
layers located between the litter layer and mineral soil
(Brown, 1974). Forest ﬂoor characteristics were
sampled in 1998 and 2001 at Fire Point but were only
sampled in 1998 at the reference sites.
2.3. Data analysis
This study capitalized on a random disturbance
event (wildﬁre) and therefore could not utilize optimal
experimental design techniques such as replication
and randomization (van Mantgem et al., 2001). How-
ever, our study had a Before-After/Control-Impact
(BACI) design (Green, 1979, 1993; Stewart-Oaten
and Murdoch, 1986; Underwood, 1994) allowing us
to compare the post-wildﬁre plant community with the
community on the same plots prior to ﬁre and with the
community on the nearby Rainbow and Powell Pla-
teaus in the same years. Our objective was to compare
changed conditions at Fire Point to a broad range of
reference conditions. Gildar et al. (2004) concluded
that there was great variability in understory reference
140

conditions within Powell and Rainbow Plateaus but
there were virtually no signiﬁcant differences between
these sites. Therefore, we combined plots from these
two sites for this analysis. Technically, the reference
plots are not ‘controls’ because they are not similar to
pre-burn conditions at Fire Point. Rather, they repre-
sent ‘reference conditions’ and are actually more
similar to post-burn conditions, as this paper seeks
to demonstrate. For clarity and brevity, we refer to pre-
ﬁre (1998) data from Fire Point as ‘Fire Point-PRE’,
post-ﬁre (2001) data from Fire Point as ‘Fire Point-
POST’, and the plots on Rainbow and Powell Plateaus
as ‘reference plots’.
Plots were sampled within a 2 month period in each
year due to time constraints imposed by intensive
sampling across a large landscape. Fire Point-PRE
was measured in early June 1998, Fire Point-POST
was measured in early July 2001, and the reference
sites were measured from mid-June to mid-July in
both years. To account for the different sampling dates
at Fire Point, we deleted spring ephemerals (Claytonia
lanceolata and Mertensia macdougalii) that were
no longer detectable in July from the community
analyses.
We used non-metric multi-dimensional scaling
(MDS) to illustrate differences in community compo-
sition among sites and years (Clarke, 1993). Non-
metric MDS ordinations were conducted using PC-
ORD software (Version 4.25; McCune and Mefford,
1999). Non-metric MDS arranges the plots in a con-
ﬁguration that minimizes the inter-plot distances
(stress). Unlike principal components analysis and
other ordination techniques, the axes in a non-metric
MDS plot have no meaning as the interest is in the
relationships between plots. We used the Bray–Curtis
distance measure with random starting conﬁgurations,
100 runs with real data, a maximum of 400 iterations
per run, and a stability criterion of 0.00001. A Monte
Carlo test with 100 randomizations was used to deter-
mine how likely the observed stress value of the ﬁnal
solution would be by chance alone. Species that
occurred on less than 5% of the plots were omitted
from the ordination (McCune and Grace, 2002).
We used a series of tests to examine whether the
reference and Fire Point plots differed from one
another in community composition in 1998, in com-
munity composition in 2001, and in rate of community
change between 1998 and 2001. Site comparisons in
1998 and in 2001 were made with DISTLM software
(Version 2.0; Anderson, 2003). This software permits
the analysis of univariate or multivariate data using
any distance measure and linear model, including
multi-factorial ANOVA designs. The calculated sta-
tistic is termed a ‘pseudo-F’ and is calculated, like a
traditional F-statistic, as the sum of the squared dis-
tances among groups divided by the sum of the
squared
distances
within
groups
(see
Anderson
(2001) and McArdle and Anderson (2001) for details).
Data were untransformed and unstandardized. Dis-
similarities were calculated using the Bray–Curtis
distance measure as this distance measure is appro-
priate for most ecological data (Faith et al., 1987). P-
values were calculated by permuting the observations
9999 times, so no assumptions of the distributional
form of the data were required.
Comparisons of rate of change between 1998 and
2001 required that we account for autocorrelation
between repeated measurements of permanent plots.
Some authors have suggested that repeat measure-
ments be analyzed as a ‘split-plot in time’ (e.g. Steel
and Torrie, 1960), but split-plot analyses assume that
the data are uncorrelated. Failure to account for auto-
correlation in the analysis may lead to differences
being declared signiﬁcant more often than they truly
are signiﬁcant. Univariate analyses can use a Green-
house–Geisser or Huynh–Feldt adjustment to account
for autocorrelation (Moser et al., 1990), but these
adjustments have not been extended to multivariate
analyses. Instead, we accounted for autocorrelation
between repeated measurements by calculating the
multivariate
dissimilarity
(Bray–Curtis
distance)
between the 1998 and 2001 data for each plot (this
is analogous to calculating the difference between two
values in a paired t-test). This calculation produced a
univariate response variable that we analyzed using a
Wilcoxon 2-sample test; a signiﬁcant result indicated
that the site with greater dissimilarity experienced a
greater change in community composition between
1998 and 2001.
We followed these tests of overall community
response by tests of individual functional groups to
see whether changes were occurring in all or in a
subset of the functional groups. Four functional groups
were identiﬁed: annual and biennial forbs (8 of 10
species in this group were annuals), perennial forbs,
graminoids, and woody species (shrubs and tree seed-

lings below breast height). The three tests described
above (testing for differences between reference and
Fire Point plots in community composition in 1998, in
community composition in 2001, and in rate of com-
munity change between 1998 and 2001) were con-
ducted
on
the
composition
of
each
functional
group. We also used the multivariate technique to test
the multivariate response of functional group species
richness (i.e. number of annual and biennial forbs,
number of perennial forbs, etc.).
To test the overall response of species richness
0.1 ha1, we calculated the total number of species
on each plot (including those species omitted from
analyses of community composition; see McCune
and Grace (2002)) and tested whether reference and
Fire Point plots differed in species richness in 1998,
species richness in 2001, and rate of change of
species richness between 1998 and 2001. Since these
analyses involved univariate response variables, the
dissimilarities between 1998 and 2001 were simply
the differences between the two species richness
values for each plot. We followed these tests of
overall species richness by tests of species richness
of each functional group to see whether changes were
occurring in all functional groups or in a subset of
them. Additional univariate tests were conducted for
plant cover, plant layer density, plant diversity (Shan-
non’s H0), and percentage of native species. We used
Wilcoxon 2-sample tests for comparisons between
sites in 1998, in 2001, and of rate of change between
sites.
We used the indicator species analysis (ISA;
Dufreˆne and Legendre, 1997) routine in PC-ORD to
identify individual plant species associated with par-
ticular sites and/or years. A hierarchical approach
compared sites and then years within sites. Species
were considered indicators of the site and/or year for
which
they
had
their
largest
indicator
value
(INDVAL). We restricted our attention to species with
P < 0:05 (assessed using Monte Carlo randomizations
with 1000 permutations) and INDVAL >25. Since
INDVAL is the product of the relative abundance
and relative frequency of a species, a species could
have an INDVAL of 25 if, for example, it occurred on
50% of the plots within a group and had a relative
abundance of at least 50% across all groups (Dufreˆne
and Legendre, 1997). For each site-year, relative
abundance was calculated as the percentage of belt
transects in which a species was detected and relative
frequency was calculated as the percentage of plots in
which a species was detected.
Since frequencies of forest ﬂoor substrates (litter,
rock, soil, wood) are correlated with one another, we
analyzed them using the multivariate procedure
described above for community composition. Forest
ﬂoor fuels data had unequal variances, so we used the
same non-parametric methods utilized above for uni-
variate community data. Forest ﬂoor fuels from Fire
Point-PRE and the references sites in 1998 were
analyzed with Wilcoxon 2-sample tests. Pre and
post-ﬁre fuels data from Fire Point were analyzed
with Wilcoxon signed ranks tests (Conover, 1999).
We were unable to compare the rate of change
between sites because fuels were not measured at
the reference plots in 2001. We also used linear
regression to examine the relationship between spe-
cies richness and forest ﬂoor fuels (litter depth, duff
depth, total forest ﬂoor depth, and duff:litter ratio).
Regressions were developed using pre-ﬁre (1998) data
from Fire Point and the reference sites.
3. Results
3.1. Understory plant community
A total of 118 species were identiﬁed across all sites
and years. The analysis of community composition
focused on the 70 species that occurred on at least 5%
of the plots. Sites differed in composition in both 1998
and 2001, though the magnitude of the difference
diminished over time (Table 1). Between 1998 and
2001, the community changed signiﬁcantly more at
Fire Point than at the reference sites (Table 1). The
non-metric MDS ordination illustrated this result by
grouping Fire Point-PRE plots together but showing
little difference between Fire Point-POST and refer-
ence plots (Fig. 2).
The compositions of all functional groups differed
between sites in 1998 but only the perennial forb and
woody plant functional groups differed between sites
in 2001 (Table 1). The annual and biennial forb
community changed at a signiﬁcantly greater rate at
Fire Point than at the reference sites (Table 1); the rate
of change for the other functional groups did not differ
between sites.
142
D.C. Laughlin et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 199 (2004) 137–152

All 118 species were included in the analysis of
species richness. Functional group species richness
differed between sites in both 1998 and 2001 but
changed signiﬁcantly more at Fire Point than at the
reference sites (Table 1). Species richness was sig-
niﬁcantly higher at the reference sites than at Fire
Point in both 1998 and 2001 (Fig. 3), though the rate of
change in species richness did not differ between sites
(Table 2). Species richness of annual and biennial
forbs differed between sites in 1998 but not in 2001
(Table 1 and Fig. 3). Between 1998 and 2001, annual
and biennial forb richness increased more at Fire Point
than at the reference sites (mean increase ¼ 3:1 and
1.8 species, respectively; Fig. 3). Species richness of
perennial forbs and of graminoids was signiﬁcantly
lower at Fire Point than at the reference sites in both
1998 and 2001, though their rates of change did not
differ between sites (Table 1 and Fig. 3).
Reference plots had signiﬁcantly higher plant cover
and plant layer density than Fire Point plots in both
years (Table 2). Plant diversity (Shannon’s H0) was
higher at the reference sites in 1998, but only margin-
ally higher in 2001. A higher percentage of the species
were native at the reference sites than at Fire Point in
1998, though these sites did not differ in percent native
species in 2001. Rates of change in these variables did
not differ between sites.
3.2. Indicator species analyses
The ISA identiﬁed 14 indicator species for the
reference sites and three indicator species for Fire
Point (Table 3). No species were indicators of the
reference sites in 1998 or 2001. One species was
identiﬁed as an indicator of Fire Point-PRE and eight
species as indicators of Fire Point-POST. Most indi-
cators of Fire Point-POST were also common at the
reference sites.
3.3. Substrates and forest ﬂoor fuels
Substrate frequencies did not vary among sites in
1998 or 2001 or in the rate of change between sites
(Table 1). The average substrate frequencies across all

at Fire Point than at the reference sites (Table 4). The
wildﬁre signiﬁcantly increased litter depth and sig-
niﬁcantly decreased duff depth at Fire Point, with the
net result being a signiﬁcant reduction in total forest
ﬂoor depth. The ﬁre consumed an average of 2.4 cm
(66%) of duff across Fire Point. Post-ﬁre total forest
ﬂoor depth at Fire Point was similar to that at the
reference sites in 1998. The ﬁre also signiﬁcantly
reduced D:L at Fire Point.
There was
a signiﬁcant negative relationship
(r2 ¼ 0:46, P ¼ 0:001) between D:L and species rich-
ness (Fig. 4). The next most signiﬁcant explanatory
variable was duff depth (r2 ¼ 0:25, P ¼ 0:008); total
forest ﬂoor and litter depths were marginally signiﬁ-
cant (0:05 < P < 0:1). However, multiple regression
indicated that duff, litter, and total forest ﬂoor depth
were not signiﬁcant if D:L was already in the model.

4. Discussion
4.1. Community response
The relict sites on Rainbow and Powell Plateaus
provide an excellent benchmark against which to
compare the effects of the Boundary Fire at Fire Point
because these sites are close together (Fig. 1) and have
similar soils, elevations, precipitation patterns, and
old-growth conditions. Rainbow and Powell Plateaus
span a range of natural variability. Therefore, pre-ﬁre
differences at Fire Point demonstrate its departure

sites did not include data from the other site. The data for each species for each site-year are the percentage of belt transects (%) and the
percentage of plots (%) in which the species was detected. For example, Achillea millefolium occurred on 58% of belt transects and 75% of
plots on the reference sites in 1998. Bold text indicates the site or year within site with which a species was most strongly associated.

from the local range of variability likely caused by ﬁre
exclusion.
The change in community composition between
Fire Point-PRE and Fire Point-POST is due at least
in part to the wildﬁre since the rate of compositional
change was greater at Fire Point than at the reference
sites (Table 1). The wildﬁre appears to have directed
the community composition of Fire Point on a trajec-
tory toward higher similarity with that of the reference
plots (see arrows connecting centroids in Fig. 2). In
other words, the ﬁre changed the community compo-
sition of Fire Point to more closely approximate that of
a forest inﬂuenced by a relatively frequent ﬁre regime.
Additional ﬁres might continue to move the commu-
nity on a trajectory toward reference conditions. Alter-
natively, if an extended period of time elapses before
the next wildﬁre at Fire Point, it is conceivable that
the community composition might revert back towards
the community evident under ﬁre exclusion (Fire
Point-PRE). Fire exclusion has been shown to alter
species composition in the overstory, primarily due to
encroachment
by
ﬁre-intolerant
trees
(Dickman,
1978); similar changes likely also occur in the unders-
tory but have received little attention.
The change in community composition was due in
part to changes in the annual and biennial forb func-
tional group (Table 1, Fig. 3). Annual and biennial forb
species richness was low at Fire Point prior to the ﬁre
but increased after the ﬁre to values similar to the
reference sites (Table 1, Fig. 3). Fluctuations in annual
populations are often associated with wet years, but
this was apparently not the case here as the sites
received less winter and early growing season pre-
cipitation in 2001 than in 1998 (see Section 2). Annual
and biennial forb species commonly respond favor-
ably to ﬁre (Barney and Frischknecht, 1974; Young
and Evans, 1978; Merrill et al., 1980; Crawford et al.,
2001), likely due to the reduction in duff depth and
increased availability of microsites for germination.
These results suggest that annual and biennial
species are an important component of understory
reference conditions in ponderosa pine forests. Forests
where ﬁre has been a frequent disturbance agent
throughout the past century may maintain high annual
and biennial species richness, suggesting that this
functional group might serve as an indicator of forest
health. The role of this functional group in the eco-
logical community is poorly understood. Further
research into the ecology of annual plants in ponder-
osa pine forests and their potential role as indicators of
forest health is warranted.
The change in the annual and biennial forb com-
munity at Fire Point was not a shift toward exotic
ruderals as has been observed following high-intensity
wildﬁres in northern Arizona (Crawford et al., 2001;

Grifﬁs et al., 2001). Exotics were also not abundant
after a prescribed ﬁre in mixed conifer forest on the
North Rim of GCNP (Huisinga et al., submitted for
publication). The low abundance of exotic species is
likely due to the remote location of the North Rim and
to long-term protection by the National Park Service.
Bromus tectorum, Lactuca serriola, and Tragopogon
dubius were the only exotic species detected in this
study. B. tectorum was more abundant at the reference
sites (Table 3), likely due to the proximity of hiking
trails to these sites (Gildar et al., 2004) and to more
suitable seedbeds created by a continuing ﬁre regime.
Recent evidence indicates that bison behavior may be
inﬂuencing B. tectorum populations on Rainbow Pla-
teau (J. Crawford, unpublished report). B. tectorum
may become an increasing problem in the southwest
as frequent, low-intensity ﬁre regimes are reintro-
duced to large areas; further research is necessary.
The compositional difference between Fire Point-
PRE and POST (Fig. 2) could be seen as an artifact of
the earlier sampling date. However, the rate of com-
munity change between sites was signiﬁcant (Table 1)
even though we omitted spring ephemerals from the
community analysis (see Section 2); inclusion of
spring ephemerals increased the statistical difference
between the pre- and post-burn measurements (data
not shown). Sampling date might also inﬂuence the
abundance of annual forbs at Fire Point-PRE (Fig. 3);
however, we feel that this is not a factor since we
collected several annual species simultaneously with
sampling at Fire Point-PRE. For example, we col-
lected Chenopodium spp., Gayophytum diffusum and
Polygonum douglasii in late May to mid-June 1998
from other locations in the region; therefore, these
species were alive and growing during sampling and
would have been detected if present. Moreover, these
annual species commonly increase after ﬁres (see
below). Furthermore, the other non-annual indicator
species of Fire Point-POST (Table 3) are easily
detected from early June to July so sampling date
would not affect detection of these species. Though
the magnitude of the difference is obscured by sam-
pling date, the direction of the change is certain. We
feel that wildﬁre effects are more signiﬁcant than
sampling date effects in this study.
In comparison to the reference sites, Fire Point had
lower species richness, plant cover, plant layer den-
sities, and plant diversity (Table 2). Low species
richness and lack of herbaceous cover have also been
noted in other ponderosa pine forests after decades of
ﬁre suppression (Covington and Moore, 1994a,b).
Other studies have demonstrated an increase in herbac-
eous production over time after ﬁres (Campbell et al.,
1977; Oswald and Covington, 1984; Andariese and
Covington, 1986). It may take more time, or more ﬁres,
to increase species richness and plant cover at Fire Point
to levels approaching those at the reference sites.
Fule´ et al. (2003) demonstrated that a ﬁre occurred
on the western portion of Fire Point in 1923 while the
eastern portion likely did not burn between 1879 and
1999. Plots on the western portion of Fire Point were
also more similar in species composition to the refer-
ence plots than plots on the eastern side of Fire Point:
black circles to the right of the Fire Point-PRE cen-
troid in Fig. 2 represent plots from the western portion
of Fire Point and black circles to the left of the centroid
represent plots from the eastern portion of the site.
This suggests that plots that burned in 1923 were more
similar to the reference plots than were plots that last
burned in 1879. Moreover, average pre-ﬁre annual and
biennial richness was lower on the eastern plots (0.3
species per plot) than the western plots (1.5 species per
plot). Average species richness was also lower on the
eastern plots (15.6 species per plot) than the western
plots (25.5 species per plot). Therefore, species rich-
ness appears to be inﬂuenced by time since the last
ﬁre.
4.2. Individual species responses
Some species were indicators of particular sites
while other species were indicators of pre- or post-
ﬁre conditions at Fire Point (Table 3). Fourteen species
were most strongly associated with the reference sites
and three species were most strongly associated with
Fire Point. Analysis of additional sites would be
necessary to determine whether these species are
indicative of these sites because of their differing ﬁre
histories or because of other conditions (e.g. edaphic)
at the sites. The absence of indicator species of the
reference sites in 1998 or 2001 provides further sup-
port that the reference sites experienced little change
between years.
Delphinium nuttalianum, the only indicator of Fire
Point-PRE, was more abundant before than after the
ﬁre (present in 94% versus 70% of the belt transects at
D.C. Laughlin et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 199 (2004) 137–152
147

Fire Point-PRE and POST, respectively) but occurred
at similar frequencies before and after the ﬁre (present
in 100% versus 93% of the plots, respectively;
Table 3). D. nuttalianum also occurred on the refer-
ence plots at abundances and frequencies comparable
to Fire Point-POST, suggesting that ﬁre reduced its
abundance but not its frequency. Known ﬁre effects on
Delphinium spp. are lacking, though D. bicolor and
D:  occidentale are probably killed by most ﬁres
(Matthews, 1993).
Eight species were indicators of post-ﬁre conditions
at Fire Point. These species were also abundant and
frequent at the reference sites (Table 3), and contrib-
uted to the similarity between Fire Point-POSTand the
reference sites (Fig. 2). This suggests that these spe-
cies represent indicators of recently burned ponderosa
pine forests on the North Rim.
Several annuals, most notably G. diffusum, Poly-
gonum douglasii, and Chenopodium spp., were absent
or infrequent before the ﬁre but abundant afterwards
(Table 3). G. diffusum was strongly favored by con-
ditions after burning in red ﬁr forests in the Sierra
Nevadas (Kilgore, 1971) and also increased after
wildﬁre in other Arizona ponderosa pine forests
(Beaulieu, 1975). Polygonum spp. are well known
for their ability to vigorously sprout from seed after
ﬁres (Ahlgren, 1960; Billings, 1969; Beaulieu, 1975).
In sagebrush-grasslands in northern Idaho, P. dougla-
sii biomass was four times greater in severely burned
areas than unburned areas (Blaisdell, 1953). Cheno-
podium spp. are also well known for their adaptations
to disturbed environments. C. album and C. leptophyl-
lum increased in frequency after a ﬁre in a Gambel oak
woodland (Poreda and Wullstein, 1994), and C. album
increased tremendously after severe ﬁres in northern
Arizona (Beaulieu, 1975; Crawford et al., 2001).
Solidago spp. are perennial forbs that are well
known for their ﬁre tolerance and are diverse in ﬁre
prone systems like tallgrass prairie. S. canadensis
responded positively to low and moderate severity
burns (Richards and Landers, 1973; Medve, 1984)
and maintained long-term abundance in Gambel oak
woodlands that burned (McKell, 1950). Other Soli-
dago spp. exhibit positive responses to ﬁre as well
(Pase and Knipe, 1977; Anderson and Bailey, 1980;
Rabinowitz, 1981).
Elymus elymoides, a perennial grass, can survive in
a wide variety of habitats, including dense stands of
pine, but also responds favorably to ﬁre. E. elymoides
was a major component of a post-ﬁre pinoˆn-juniper
woodland in the Great Basin (Koniak, 1985) and also
increased in abundance after ﬁres in ponderosa pine
forests in Arizona (Beaulieu, 1975; Vose and White,
1991). Prescribed ﬁre increased inﬂorescence biomass
in E. elymoides (Young and Miller, 1985). Wright
(1971) determined that E. elymoides is tolerant of ﬁre
because its low biomass burns quickly, preventing heat
from penetrating to the meristems.
Calochortus nuttallii, Hesperostipa comata, and
Lotus spp. were indicators of Fire Point-POST but
their abilities to tolerate ﬁre are less clear in the
literature. Fire appears to be important for C. nitidus
in open woodlands and grasslands in Idaho (Mancuso
and Moseley, 1994); the deeply buried perennial bulbs
of Calochortus spp. are likely well-protected from ﬁre.
Autumn ﬁres (such as this one) damage H. comata far
less than spring and summer burns (Wright and
Klemmedson,
1965;
Wright,
1970).
Lotus
spp. increased after ﬁres in Arizona ponderosa pine
forests (Beaulieu, 1975).
4.3. Fuel load reduction
The most signiﬁcant and predictable effect of the
wildﬁre on forest ﬂoor fuels was a signiﬁcant reduc-
tion in forest ﬂoor depth (Table 4). After at least 76
years of ﬁre exclusion, the forest ﬂoor at Fire Point
averaged 4.3 cm deep. Another ﬁre-excluded ponder-
osa pine stand on Galahad Point had an average forest
ﬂoor depth of 5.6 cm (Gildar et al., 2004). The wildﬁre
on Fire Point reduced the mean forest ﬂoor depth by
40%. The total reduction in forest ﬂoor depth was
entirely due to duff consumption, since litter depth
increased after the ﬁre due to needle fall from ﬁre-
scorched trees (Table 4). Post-ﬁre and reference site
duff depths were within the range (<2 cm) predicted
by a model simulating cumulative ﬁre effects in
ponderosa pine/Douglas-ﬁr forests (Keane et al.,
1990).
The accumulation of duff during years of ﬁre
exclusion can negatively impact the plant community.
The D:L explained more of the variation of species
richness than any other forest ﬂoor variable (Fig. 4),
suggesting that there is an interactive effect of duff and
litter depth on the plant community. Species richness
declined as duff depth increased relative to litter depth
148
D.C. Laughlin et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 199 (2004) 137–152

(Fig. 4). In theory, therefore, species richness could
still be high if litter depths are greater than duff depths.
Of course, species richness is also related to other
environmental factors, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal
inoculum potential (AMIP), canopy cover (Huisinga
et al., submitted for publication) and tree densities, but
many of these variables are also correlated with duff
depth (AMIP is signiﬁcantly negatively related to duff
depth; Gildar, 2002). Wildﬁres that reduce duff depths
and D:L should eventually allow for an increase in
plant species richness.
4.4. Reference conditions and ecosystem
management
The increasing size and scope of ecological restora-
tion efforts throughout the southwest are magnifying
the need to understand understory reference condi-
tions of southwestern ponderosa pine forests. The vast
majority of plant diversity in this system is found in
the understory and the herbaceous layer provides
cover and forage for many native animals (Friederici,
2003). Covington and Moore (1994b) estimated her-
bage production to be almost four times greater in
1901 than in 2001 within Arizona ponderosa pine
forests. Other recent studies regarding understory
reference conditions concluded that grasses were more
prevalent in historical times near Flagstaff, Arizona
(Kerns et al., 2001) and that grasses are more abundant
in old-growth forests than in dense stands (Naumburg
and DeWald, 1999). Based on analysis of soil phyto-
lith assemblages from locations south of the Grand
Canyon, Kerns et al. (2001) concluded that C4 plants
were once more widespread than at present but were
still likely less abundant than C3 plants. We found very
few C4 grasses on the North Rim: only 3 of the 12
grasses detected were C4, and these three species were
detected on <7% of the plots. Perhaps C3 grasses are
better adapted to the generally cooler and wetter pine
forests of the North Rim, and C4 grasses were never
dominant in these speciﬁc pine forests.
Remote old-growth forests on Powell and Rainbow
Plateaus provide valuable examples of reference con-
ditions for North Rim ponderosa pine forests. Unders-
tory communities in ponderosa pine forests exhibit a
range of variability throughout space and time. In
general, however, North Rim forests with continuing
ﬁre regimes are characterized by a high proportion of
native species, high plant cover (Table 2), low fuel
loads (Table 4), and a diversity of species (Table 2)
from various functional groups (Fig. 3), especially
annual and biennial forbs. We suggest that these
characteristics can be used as benchmarks for asses-
sing the success of restoration projects (Christensen
et al., 1996) designed to restore presettlement refer-
ence conditions in ponderosa pine forests on the North
Rim. Reference conditions in North Rim forests likely
differ from reference conditions in other southwestern
forests with differing moisture regimes, soils, and
bedrock (Gildar et al., 2004). Extrapolation of data
from these sites to other biogeographical regions
should be made cautiously and must recognize inher-
ent site differences.
Fire is an extremely important process in western
forests (Agee, 1993) and can play an essential role in
restoring reference conditions to certain forest types
(Stephenson, 1999). This study demonstrates that a
wildﬁre that was allowed to burn in an old-growth
ponderosa pine forest directed the understory com-
munity towards that found on reference sites by
shifting the species composition and reducing fuel
loads. This suggests that the Wildland Fire Use strat-
egy is a useful management tool for directing unders-
tory communities toward reference conditions. We
recommend that land managers continue to allow
lightning-set, low-intensity ﬁres to burn in old-growth
forests to encourage forested landscapes to remain
within the historic range of variability.
