Abstract: The ability of reserves to maintain natural ecosystem processes such as fire disturbance regimes is 
central to long-term conservation. Fire-scarred tree samples were used to reconstructfire regimes atfive study 
sites totaling approximately 230 ha in pine (Pinus spp.) and oak (Quercus spp.) forests of La Michilia Bio- 
sphere Reserve on the dry east slope of the Sierra Madre Occidental, Durango, Mexico. Study sites covered a 
20-km environmental gradient of elevation, topography, and human land uses. Plant communities ranged 
from oak-pine to mixed conifer forests. Fires were frequent at all sites prior to 1930, when large-scale grazing 
of domestic livestock was initiated. Widespread fires have been excluded from four of the five sites since 
1945, with an essentially uninterrupted regime offrequent fires continuing only in the reserve core. Xeric 
sites had many, smaller fires, whereas mesic sites had fewer but larger fires. On a reserve-wide scale, a fire 
burned on at least one site nearly every year, usually in the dry spring or early summer season, butfire years 
were rarely synchronous among the sites. Fire occurrence was weakly related to the Southern Oscillation cli- 
mate pattern; major reserve-wide fire years almost never coincided with wet Southern Oscillation extremes 
but only occasionally matched dry extremes. Maintenance of the long-term frequent-fire regime in the reserve 
core is one indicator that the biosphere reserve model has been successful in conserving natural processes, 
but the protected area is small (7000 ha). Because of the key role offrequent-fire regimes in regulating eco- 
system structure andfunction, restoration of the ecological role offire disturbance is a desirable conserva- 
tion strategy.

Introduction 
The key role of frequent, low-intensity surface-fire re- 
gimes in regulating forest density, species composition, 
and dead biomass in long-needled pine forests (Pinus 
section Ponderosae) has been well established in west- 
ern North America (Covington et al. 1994; Arno et al. 
1995; Fule & Covington 1996; Swetnam & Baisan 1996). 
But undisrupted frequent-fire regimes, those with fire- 
return intervals of 1-25 years (Pyne et al. 1996), con- 
tinue in unharvested forests in only a few forests of 
northwestern Mexico, the southernmost range of Ponde- 
rosae ecosystems (Leopold 1937; Minnich et al. 1995; 
Fule & Covington 1996). Because these areas represent 
rare examples of continuing, natural fire-disturbance re- 
gimes, they are valuable sites for the study of processes 
such as regeneration, mortality (Savage 1997), habitat 
use by wildlife (Minnich et al. 1995), and relationships 
between fire regime, forest structure, and spatial pat- 
terns of trees (Fule & Covington 1997, 1998). The op- 
portunity to learn from these sites may be limited in the 
future, however, because only a tiny fraction of forests 
in northern Mexico are protected, and many of these 
lands are degraded (Sanchez-Velez 1987). 
Frequent fires in northern Mexico appear to maintain 
relatively open forests by thinning small trees, limiting 
tree seedling establishment, and keeping fire-susceptible 
conifers (Abies, Pseudotsuga) from invading mesic pine 
sites (Barton 1995; Minnich et al. 1995; Fule & Coving- 
ton 1997, 1998). At sites in northwestern Durango, Mex- 
ico, where fire has been excluded for 30-50 years, Fule 
and Covington (1997) found that densities of small trees 
increased together with forest floor depth and coarse 
woody debris loadings, leading to forest structural con- 
ditions that could support stand-replacing fire behavior. 
These changes parallel those in ponderosa pine (Pinus 
ponderosa) ecosystems of the United States, where a 
century or more of fire exclusion initiated by livestock 
grazing, fire suppression, and logging associated with 
EuroAmerican settlement has led to declines in ecosys- 
tem health (Kolb et al. 1994) as measured by imbalances 
in ecosystem processes (e.g., decomposition rates, tree 
mortality rates), loss of diversity, and reduced resistance 
to catastrophic change, especially high-intensity wild- 
fire. 
Fire-disturbance regimes are strongly influenced by lo- 
cal environmental differences associated with eleva- 
tional gradients, topographic characteristics, and human 
influences. Environmental site factors can affect fire re- 
gimes in several ways: (1) production of vegetation 
(fuel) varies with site characteristics; (2) climatic factors 
that affect fire behavior, including windspeed and rela- 
tive humidity, are related to site characteristics such as 
elevation and aspect; and (3) human activities, which 
are a predominant determining factor of most modern 
fire regimes, are usually associated with distinct site 
characteristics (e.g., lowlands are used primarily for agri- 
culture and settlement, uplands for livestock grazing or 
forestry). Interactions of these factors can create com- 
plex patterns. For example, although the lower limits of 
species' distributions were regulated primarily by soil 
moisture in a coniferous Madrean forest in southeastern 
Arizona, fire disturbance appeared to be a strong force 
controlling plant distributions at elevations above the 
minimal physiological threshold (Barton 1993, 1994). 
Although similarities between fire-adapted forests in 
Mexico and the United States suggest that analogous pat- 
terns are likely to prevail across environmental gradients 
in northern Mexico, few or no contemporary studies 
exist (Gonzalez-Caban & Sandberg 1989). As Mexico re- 
covers from the unprecedented wildfires of 1998, fire re- 
gime information is important for assessing wildfire be- 
havior and selecting appropriate fire management 
strategies. We compared fire regimes at sites selected 
across an environmental gradient in La Michilia Bio- 
sphere Reserve on the dry eastern slope of the Sierra Ma- 
dre Occidental. We asked the following questions: (1) 
What are the long-term fire-disturbance patterns (fre- 
quency, size, relationship to climate and environmental 
conditions)? (2) Have fire regimes been recently dis- 
rupted? (3) Has the conservation design, in this case a 
biosphere reserve, been effective in conserving fire as a 
natural ecological process? 
Study Area 
La Michilila Biosphere Reserve is located on the eastern 
slopes of the Sierra Madre Occidental along the border 
of the states of Durango and Zacatecas, (lat 23?15'- 
23?35'N, long 104?-104?20'W, crossed by the Tropic of 
Cancer; Fig. 1). The reserve was established in 1975 for 
the conservation of genetic diversity and scientific inves- 
tigation (Halffter 1978). As with other biosphere re- 
serves around the world, La Michilia is not a preserve 
but is managed for sustainable uses compatible with

long-term ecological conservation. The reserve site was 
selected because (1) it represents millions of hectares of 
dry pine-oak forests and grasslands in northern and cen- 
tral Mexico (in broader terms, even larger areas are rep- 
resented: La Michilia is paired in the Man and the Bio- 
sphere system with Beaver Creek Biosphere Reserve in 
Arizona, approximately 1100 km to the north); (2) it 
contains an elevational range that includes communities

from high desert to alpine, representing some of the 
wide biological diversity found in Mexico (Toledo & Or- 
doniez 1993); and (3) the geographic isolation and low 
human population density of the region has prevented 
extensive use of forest resources, leaving the reserve 
ecosystem "natural, rich, and gifted with a great capacity 
for auto-regulation" (Barbault 1978:51). 
Gonzalez-Elizondo et al. (1993) summarized the physi- 
cal characteristics of the reserve. Located between two 
small mountain ranges, the Sierra de Michis and Sierra de 
Urica, which form an eastward extension of the Sierra 
Madre Occidental, the reserve ranges between 2000 and 
2985 m in elevation. Soils and geologic formations are of 
igneous origin, predominantly rhyolitic. Annual precipi- 
tation fluctuates between 600 and 860 mm, with a rainy 
season from May to September, a period of occasional 
rains from October to January, and a dry period from 
February to April. The average annual temperature is 
11.6? C, with an average high temperature in June of 
23.8? C and an average low temperature in January of 
- 2.7? C. Ownership of the reserve is mixed, with a 
7000-ha government-owned central core and approxi- 
mately 70,000 ha in the "buffer zone" under private 
ownership or communally owned lands called ejidos. 
Five study sites totaling approximately 230 ha were se- 
lected to represent an environmental gradient crossing 
the reserve (Table 1), including the major forest commu- 
nities of oak-pine (low elevation, xeric), pine-oak (low 
elevation, intermediate), pine-oak (high elevation, mesic), 
and mixed conifer (high elevation, mesic). Tree species 
are listed in Table 2. The study sites were chosen as rep- 
resentative areas following review of previous studies 
and a reconnaissance of the reserve. The gradient also 
coincides with human settlement and land-use patterns, 
as represented in the biosphere reserve management 
scheme: the low-elevation sites, Arroyo San Pedro (ASP) 
and Arroyo Taray (AT) are in the reserve buffer zone, 
where human land use is most intense. Human impact is 
more limited at the higher sites, Cerro Almagre (CA) and 
Playa Grande (PG). The CA site is remote, steep, and far 
from water, but the land is communally owned and sea- 
sonally available for grazing. The PG forest is in the core 
area, the only part of the biosphere reserve officially pro- 
tected from extractive uses. 
Methods 
We sampled fire-scarred trees in June 1996 at all sites ex- 
cept Playa Grande (April 1997). Partial cross-sections 
were cut from scarred "catfaces" on trees, logs, and 
stumps of conifers apparently containing the oldest and/ 
or most extensive fire records. Several oak samples were 
collected but proved to be unusable due to rot in the 
scarred areas. We attempted to collect 30-40 fire- 
scarred samples per site, but sample size was limited at 
the ASP sites due to the predominance of oaks and the 
low density of old pine trees. Samples were mapped 
when collected and were well distributed throughout 
the study areas, except for the ASP-S site, where fire- 
scarred pines were found primarily along the western 
and eastern sides of the 30-ha area. 
In the lab, samples were mounted and surfaced with 
fine-grit sandpaper. A total of 112 samples was cross- 
dated (Stokes & Smiley 1968) by means of characteristic 
patterns of narrow marker years: 1789, 90, 1805, 26, 28, 
30, 36, 38, 57, 82, 87, 93, 1904, 25 (thin latewood), 29, 
32, 57, 80, 82, and 89. Master tree-ring chronologies de- 
veloped elsewhere in Durango by Harlan (1973) and 
D. W. Stahle (personal communication) also were used 
in crossdating. After initial dating, ring widths of all sam- 
ples were measured in order to check dating with the 
Cofecha program (Grissino-Mayer & Holmes 1993), and 
all dates were independently visually confirmed by an- 
other dendrochronologist. The season of fire occurrence 
(Baisan & Swetnam 1990) was estimated based on the

relative position of each fire lesion within the annual 
ring according to the following categories: EE (early ear- 
lywood), 
ME (middle earlywood), 
LE (late earlywood), 
L (latewood), 
and D (dormant). Dormant season scars 
were assigned to the year of the following earlywood 
(i.e., spring fires), a convention that appears valid for the 
spring drought-summer 
monsoon 
climate pattern of 
northern Mexico (Fule & Covington 1996, 1997) and the 
southwestern 
United States (Baisan & Swetnam 1990). 
Phenological data exist for ponderosa pine (Pinus pon- 
derosa) in southern Arizona, permitting calendar dates 
to be assigned to these within-ring positions (Baisan & 
Swetnam 1990). Because we have no such information 
for the species and region studied here, fires were di- 
vided only into "spring" (D + EE) and "summer" (ME + 
LE + L) groups. 
Fire-history data were analyzed with the FHX2 software 
(Grissino-Mayer 1995). Analysis at each site began with 
the first year with an adequate sample depth (Grissino- 
Mayer et al. 1994), defined as the first fire year recorded 
by 10% or more of the total sample size of "recording" 
trees at each site. Recording trees are those with open 
fire scars or other injuries (e.g., lightning scars), leaving 
them susceptible to repeated scarring by fire (Swetnam 
& Baisan 1996). A common fire-history ending date of 
1996 was used (sites measured in June 1996 were revis- 
ited in April 1997 to check for fires later in 1996; no evi- 
dence was found). 
Fire-return intervals were analyzed statistically in dif- 
ferent subcategories related to the size and/or intensity 
of past fires. The size of past fires in frequent-fire ecosys- 
tems cannot be precisely reconstructed because most 
overstory trees survive such fires (Swetnam & Baisan 
1996), precluding fire-history methods based on stand 
ages and stand mapping (e.g., Heinselman 1973). Swet- 
nam and Baisan (1996), argue, however, that fire years 
in which only one or two samples were scarred proba- 
bly represent relatively small fires, whereas fire years in 
which a greater proportion of samples were scarred rep- 
resent relatively larger fires. Accordingly, the fire data 
were filtered to look at progressively greater propor- 
tional scarring. First, all fire years, even those repre- 
sented by a single scar, were considered. Then only 
those fire years were included in which, respectively, 
10% or more and 25% or more of the recording samples 
were scarred. Comparing study areas of different sizes 
may be misleading because larger study areas may en- 
compass more small fires, leading to an artificially high 
fire frequency compared to that of smaller study areas. 
Therefore we divided the two larger study areas (AT and 
PG, 70 ha each) in half geographically and compared fire 
regime results on an approximately equal-area basis (ap- 
proximately 35 ha versus 30 ha each for the smaller 
study areas of ASP-S, ASP-N, and CA). 
The statistical analysis of fire-return intervals includes 
several measures of central tendency: the mean fire in- 
terval (MFI, average number of years between fires), the 
median, and the Weibull median probability interval 
(WMPI). This last statistic is a central measure in the Wei- 
bull distribution, used to model asymmetric fire-interval 
distributions and to express fire-return intervals in probabi- 
listic terms (Grissino-Mayer et al. 1994; Swetnam & Baisan 
1996). Because fire-return intervals are rarely normally dis- 
tributed, the WMPI is preferred over the MFI, although the 
values are often numerically similar. Reserve-wide fire oc- 
currence among sites was analyzed over the 108 years 
(1837-1945) during which all five sites shared recording 
samples. The three longer-record sites were analyzed sep- 
arately for reserve-wide fire occurrence over the longer 
period of 166 years (1779-1945). During both periods, 
fires within sites were analyzed in the all-scar and 25%- 
scar categories to examine possible differences in fire re- 
gime between smaller and larger fires. Finally, to investi- 
gate the occurrence of simultaneous fires across the 
Michilia landscape, fires between sites were compared in 
three categories: all fire years (fire at any site), fire years at 
50% or more of the sites, and fire years represented at 
75% or more of the sites.

To see whether pre-exclusion fire-return intervals and 
percentage of scarring had changed over time, the fire 
records prior to recent fire exclusion were divided into ear- 
lier and later halves at each study site and compared. Fire 
distributions were tested for significantly different means 
(t test), variances (F test), and distributions (Kolmogorov- 
Smirnov test). The alpha level for all tests was 0.05. In addi- 
tion, the spatial homogeneity of fires in the two nearby Ar- 
royo San Pedro study sites was investigated by testing the 
synchroneity of fire years (chi-square tests, 2 X 2 and 2 X 1 
contingency tables [Grissino-Mayer 1995]). Additional de- 
tail on statistical procedures is presented by Swetnam and 
Baisan (1996) and Grissino-Mayer (1995). 
Results 
Low-Elevation Oak-Pine Forest 
Numerous fires burned in the past in these dry forests, 
but both sites entered an extended period of fire exclu- 
sion beginning in the early 1930s (Fig. 2). The fire-free 
period at ASP-N lasted 64 years, except for a 1966 scar 
on a single sample tree, until an intense 1996 wildfire 
caused substantial tree mortality (n = 15 fire-scarred 
samples). The ASP-S site had fire exclusion since 1930, 
except for a single sample scarred in 1949 (n = 6 fire- 
scarred samples). Before fire exclusion (1837-1932), the 
ASP-N site had a Weibull median probability interval 
(WMPI) of 3.7 years, including all scars (Table 3). The 
10%-scarred category was nearly identical to the all-scar 
category, indicating that most fire years are represented 
by at least two scarred samples. But the WMPI of the 
25% category, 5.5 years, is about 50% higher, suggesting 
that a number of fires may not have grown large enough 
to cross the entire study area (30 ha). Fire patterns and 
pre-exclusion WMPI values were similar at ASP-S. (The 
all-scar and 10%-scarred categories were identical to 
each other at ASP-S due to the small sample size.) 
The effect of fire exclusion was most striking in com- 
paring the pre-exclusion fire frequencies to the post- 
exclusion fire records: only one fire in 66 years at ASP-S 
(scarring only 1 sample tree in 1949) and two fires in 64 
years at ASP-N (scarring 1 sample tree in 1966, crossing 
the entire area in 1996), in contrast to pre-exclusion 
WMPI values of 4.7 and 3.7 years, respectively. 
Fire years were highly asynchronous between the two 
sites, even though the two ASP sites were close to- 
gether, had similar vegetation types and land-use pat- 
terns, and had nearly identical fire regimes in statistical 
terms (Tables 3 & 4). The fire chronologies were not sta- 
tistically independent between the two sites (chi-square 
contingency test, 2 X 2 contingency table, p < 0.005), 
but the number of synchronous fire dates was smaller 
than asynchronous dates (chi-square contingency test, 
2 x 1 contingency table, p < 0.05). 
Low- and High-Elevation Pine-Oak Forest 
Fire frequency at AT was highest of all the sites until 1945 
(n = 33 fire-scarred samples; Table 3, Fig. 2). The differ- 
ence between the all-scar WMPI and the 25%-scarred 
WMPI was nearly 75%, the highest of the study sites, but 
both WMPI values were the lowest of all sites in their re- 
spective categories, suggesting that AT had the greatest 
total number of small as well as large fires. Division of the 
AT samples into two geographic halves, representing ap- 
proximately 35 ha each, caused no significant difference in 
fire frequency in any category (all, 10%, or 25% scarred), 
except for an increase in the all-scar MFI to 4.95 for the 
western half of site AT. Thus, fire frequency results were 
robust when converted to approximately equal-area 
terms with the 30-ha study sites, supporting the direct 
cross-site comparison presented in Table 3. No fires at all 
were recorded in the 51 years since 1945, making AT the 
only site of the five with such an abrupt and well-defined 
disruption of the frequent-fire regime. 
Widespread frequent fires continued up to the present 
in the reserve core at PG, the only site with a relatively 
undisrupted fire regime (n = 32 fire-scarred samples; 
Fig. 2). Even at PG, fire frequency declined after 1945. A 
long fire-free period occurred between 1945 and 1971, 
but this 26-year interval is only about twice as long as 
the maximum pre-1945 fire-free period of 16-17 years 
(Table 3). In contrast, the recent 51 years of fire exclu- 
sion at AT is about five times longer than the maximum 
predisruption interval. The post-1945 fires at PG, in 
1971 and 1989, scarred nearly all of the sample trees, ap- 
parently similar in extent and effects on forest structure 
to the pre-1945 fires (P.Z.F., unpublished data). 
Fire-return intervals were longer (7-9.5 years) at PG 
than the pre-exclusion fire intervals at the lower sites, 
and most fires appear to have been relatively large: the 
25%-scarred WMPI is only about 20% higher than the all- 
scar WMPI (Table 3). There was low variability (standard 
deviation) in the fire-interval distribution (Table 3). Only 
one pair of fires occurred in subsequent years (1944 and 
1945), showing a clear geographic demarcation be- 
tween the fires. The 1944 fire burned approximately 20 
ha of the study site (based on the mapped locations of 
the fire-scarred sample trees), whereas the 1945 fire cov- 
ered the remaining 50 ha. Division of the PG samples 
into two halves, representing approximately 35 ha each, 
caused no significant difference in fire frequency in any 
category (all, 10%, or 25% scarred), again supporting the 
direct cross-site comparison presented in Table 3. 
High-Elevation Mixed Conifer Forest 
Fire regime changes at site CA, at the crest of the Sierra 
Urica on the border between Durango and Zacatecas, 
were the most complex of all the sites (n = 26 fire-scarred 
samples; Fig. 2). Frequent fires occurred up to 1893, fol-

spread fires in 1928 and 1935. Most recently, a 51-year 
fire-exclusion period has prevailed up to the present, ex-

the site, near the top of the mountain, in 1945 and 1973. 
Before 1893 the fire regime at CA was most similar to 
those of the lower-elevation sites: the WMPI (all scar) was 
4.8 years and the WMPI (25% scarred) was about twice as 
long (Table 3). The 35-year, fire-free period between 1893 
and 1928 was nearly three times longer than the maxi-

*Statistical analysis was carried out in three categories: (1) all fire years, including those represented by a single fire scar; (2) fire years in 
which 10% or more of the recording sample trees were scarred; and (3) fire years in which 25% or more of the recording sample trees were 
scarrSed. For sites where an apparent disruption of the long-term frequent-fire regime was identified, fire-return intervals are calczulated for the 
predisruption period (PRE) as well as the full sampling period (FULL). Evidence of two possible dates offire-regime change was noted at site CA, 
so it has three analysis periods. In addition to the fire-scar data, site ASP-N was burned over by a wildfire in May 1996 
mum in the 25%-scar distribution, suggesting that the 35- 
year gap may not have been excessively long for this site. 
Reserve-Wide Fire Analysis 
About 80% of fires for which season could be deter- 
mined occurred in the spring at all sites (Table 4). Sea- 
sons could be determined on 50-80% of the fire scars 
at each site. The large number of early earlywood fires 
and the general lack of late-season scars supports the 
assumption that dormant-season fires burned in the 
spring, before earlywood formation. Because narrow 
tree rings were the most common reason for failure to 
identify the season, the determination of seasonal distri- 
bution might be biased toward years in which relatively 
good conditions for tree growth produced wider rings. 
Including all the study sites, fires burned in at least 
some portion of the reserve at least every 2 years until

widespread disruption of frequent-fire regimes after 
1945 (Fig. 2), but reserve-wide fire occurrence was 
highly variable depending on the categories of analysis 
(Table 5). Including any fire, even those scarring a single 
sample tree, at any site, the reserve-wide WMPI was only 
1.6 years between 1837 and 1945. The WMPI was ap- 
proximately 30% longer (2.1 years between 1837 and 
1945) for fire years limited to those scarring 25% or 
more of the sample trees. But fire intervals increased by 
a factor of 5-6 for fire years burning in 50% or more of 
the sites and increased by a factor of 16-25 for fires 
burning in 75% or more of the sites. Only 1 fire year 
(1871) is recorded at all five sites. Thus, although fires 
were frequent at La Michilia before 1945, fire sizes ap- 
pear to have remained relatively small and fires were 
rarely synchronous between sites. 
The WMPI values (Table 5) were approximately 30% 
shorter in the five-site analysis period (1837-1945) than 
in the three-site analysis period (1779-1945). This result 
could be due either to fire frequency increasing over 
time or to the effect of adding more sites. Two lines of 
evidence suggest that the difference is due primarily to 
the additional sites. First, several sites showed decreases 
in fire frequency toward the end of the analysis periods 
(site CA, no fires between 1893 and 1928; ASP sites, last 
widespread fire in early 1930s), and no site evidenced 
increasing fire frequency. Second, because the generally 
asynchronous pattern of fire occurrence between sites 
suggests that small, local fires were common, the addi- 
tion of more sites is likely to add new fire dates. 
Discussion 
Environmental Gradient and Fire Regimes 
The gradient of environmental conditions appears to be 
related to the four main trends observed in fire regimes 
across La Michilia Reserve: (1) numerous fires, many of 
them small in area; (2) higher fire frequency at lower el-

evations than higher elevations; (3) asynchrony in fire 
occurrence between sites, with few years in which a 
large fraction of the landscape burned; and (4) extended 
fire-free periods beginning in the twentieth century at 
four of the five sites. The strength of inferences or gen- 
eralizabiity of the fire regime data differs: the strongest 
data are the fire histories of the study sites, which are 
precisely dated, to the temporal extent supported by 
sampling and allowing for the possibility of additional 
fires that left no scars. Based on the review of previous 
studies and reconnaissance, the study sites appear to be 
reasonably representative of similar forests in and 
around La Michilia. Less conclusive are any causal rela- 
tionships between fire regime changes and environmen- 
tal characteristics and human activities such as livestock 
grazing. Nevertheless, the positive and negative links be- 
tween fire-regime characteristics and three important en- 
vironmental factors-site characteristics, climate, and hu- 
man influences-can 
suggest possible explanations for 
changing ecological patterns, especially where these cor- 
relations are biologically logical and consistent with re- 
sults elsewhere. 
SITE CHARACTERISTICS 
Forest communities at La Michilia are distributed along a 
moisture gradient determined by various combinations 
of elevation, slope, aspect, and soils (Gonz'alez-Elizondo 
et al. 1993; Renteria-Arrieta & Garcia-Arevalo 1997). 
Mesic sites (PG and CA: high elevation, northern aspect) 
support more biomass (i.e., fuel) than the drier sites 
(ASP and AT: low elevation, other aspects) (P.Z.F. et al., 
unpublished data). Steep slopes would tend to encour- 
age the spread of heading fires, and high-elevation areas 
may be more frequently struck by lightning. The remote 
mesic sites also present a greater challenge to limited 
firefighting resources. The fire regime results show that 
mesic-site fires were more likely than dry-site fires to be- 
come widespread, as measured by the relatively smaller 
difference between the all-scar and 25%-scarred fire- 
return intervals (Table 3). Because fire recurrence at the 
mesic sites was limited to approximately every 7-10 
years, however, either humid weather conditions or in- 
frequent ignitions appear to have forestalled fires in 
most years. 
In contrast, the xeric sites (ASP-N and ASP-S) had gen- 
tle to flat slopes, slowing fire spread, although drier 
weather conditions probably could support wildfires al- 
most every year. Lightning strikes might be relatively 
less likely at the xeric sites because of their lower eleva- 
tion, but the probability of human-caused ignitions is 
high. But fire suppression efforts are more feasible at the 
xeric sites due to their proximity to communities, farm- 
lands, and roads, which also serve as firebreaks. 
The shortest fire-return intervals in the entire reserve 
were observed at the intermediate site AT. This site may 
have the overall mix of characteristics most suited for 
fire: (1) mesic enough to support more biomass and 
more continuous fuels than the xeric sites; (2) relatively 
low in elevation for more reliable warm, dry weather 
than the mesic sites, with steep slopes that permit fast 
fire spread; and (3) close to human populations, thereby 
receiving both lightning and human-caused ignitions. 
CLIMATE 
Seasonal climate patterns appear to be an important fac- 
tor in promoting fire occurrence from the spring to mid- 
summer, corresponding with the typical spring drought 
and the lightning associated with the onset of the mon- 
soon. Human-caused ignitions may also be higher in the 
spring due to burning of agricultural fields. Few fires 
burned in the humid late summer and fall, despite the 
continuing possibility of human-caused ignitions. 
Inter-annual regulation of fire occurrence is less clear. 
The El Niiio-Southern Oscillation climate pattern, the 
major source of inter-annual variation in climate, is well 
correlated with tree growth in the Sierra Madre Occi- 
dental (Stahle & Cleaveland 1993), but climatic factors 
appear to have been less correlated with reserve-wide 
fire occurrence at La Michilia than at sites in northwest- 
ern Durango. Major reserve-wide fire years, defined as 
those in which fires were recorded at 60% or more of 
the study sites, occurred about every 10 years between 
1779 and 1945 (Table 6; mean 9.77 years, minimum 2 
years, maximum 37 years, SD 8.22 years). Reserve-wide

gory) occurred half as frequently as all reserve-wide 
fires. Positive Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) extremes 
are characterized by cold, dry conditions. But only 4 of 
the 18 major reserve-wide fire years (22%) and only one 
of the reserve-wide fire years using the 25%-scarred cri- 
terion (1929) corresponded to 1 of the 29 positive SOI 
extremes during the 1779-1945 period. In contrast, 7 of 
10 major regional fire years (70%) at four sites in north- 
western Durango occurred during positive SOI extremes 
(Fule & Covington 1997). Negative SOI extremes, when 
generally warmer but moister conditions may have re- 
tarded fire ignition and spread, occurred 17 times be- 
tween 1779 and 1945 but coincided with only one re- 
serve-wide fire year at La Michilia (1912) and none in 
northwestern Durango (Fule & Covington 1997). Al- 
though the number of study sites remains small, the data 
suggest that negative SOI extremes are consistently asso- 
ciated with relatively low-fire years, but the association 
between positive SOI extremes and high-fire years may 
be weak. 
HUMAN INFLUENCES 
Humans have been present in ecosystems of the Michilia 
region for tens of thousands of years (Gerhard 1982). 
Much of Durango was populated by Tepehu'an people, 
who traditionally used fire for agriculture and hunting 
(Pennington 1969), although indigenous populations 
dropped rapidly following European contact (Gerhard 
1982). The first permanent Spanish settlement in Du- 
rango, Nombre de Dios, was established about 1560 
(Jones 1988) approximately 45 km northwest of the 
present-day Michilia Reserve. 
Although human presence was already longstanding in 
the region by the earliest dates of the fire regimes recon- 
structed in the present study (mid-1700s), fire patterns 
were generally relatively stable until the mid-twentieth 
century. These frequent-fire regimes may have been due 
to a mix of lightning and human-caused ignitions. Human- 
caused ignitions are popularly believed to be the major 
cause of forest fires in Mexico (Gonzalez-Cab'an & Sand- 
berg 1989; Fule & Covington 1996), but reliable statisti- 
cal data do not exist. Because population density was 
low before the mid-twentieth century (J. Medina Flores, 
personal communication), lightning probably has been 
and remains an important ignition source at Michilia, as 
in similar monsoonal climates with high lightning den- 
sity (Baisan & Swetnam 1997). The asynchrony of fire 
years between lowland fires, presumably more likely to 
be of human origin, and upland fires also suggests that at 
least the latter sites were independently ignited, proba- 
bly by lightning. 
The greatest human influence on the fire-disturbance 
regime is seen in the post-1930 period of fire exclusion. 
Between 1932 and 1962, a North American rancher, Ray- 
mond Bell, owned the hacienda that later formed La 
Michilia (A. Morales and C. Galindo, unpublished manu- 
script, Instituto de Ecologia, Durango, Mexico). Large 
numbers of livestock were purchased, grazed on the 
range, and then sold on the Mexican and U.S. markets. 
Bell maintained about 7,000 head of cattle, taking full ad- 
vantage of the excellent condition of the pastures. His 
ranch manager noted that supplemental feeding was not 
necessary because of the high quality of the grasses. 
Census data in 1940 for the municipio of Suchil, includ- 
ing Bell's approximately 50,000-ha ranch, listed 9,771 
cattle, 14,946 horses, mules, and donkeys, 3,337 sheep, 
2,866 goats, and 4,877 swine (J. F. Nieto, personal com- 
munication). Heavy grazing and foraging by domestic 
livestock, breaking the continuity of herbaceous fuels, is 
likely the primary cause of the exclusion of widespread 
fire from four of the five study sites beginning around 
1930. Only the Playa Grande site continued to burn, 
probably due to its remoteness and lack of water, al- 
though the relatively long 26-year, fire-free period sug- 
gests that grazing had an effect even here. 
The Bell hacienda was divided in the late 1960s, form- 
ing several private ranches and the ejido of San Juan de 
Michis. Contemporary livestock numbers are somewhat 
lower, but grazing has been identified as a contemporary 
management problem in buffer zones of the reserve 
(Galindo-Leal et al. 1993). Gallina et al. (1978) compared 
photographs of forest openings in the dry and wet sea- 
sons, showing that the herbaceous biomass produced in 
summer was absent by the following spring. Most herba- 
ceous forage was probably consumed by livestock be- 
cause fecal analysis indicated that the largest native her- 
bivore, the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), 
primarily ate shrub and tree vegetation (Gallina et al. 
1978). 
Heavy livestock grazing has been identified as a major 
factor initiating fire exclusion throughout frequent-fire 
ecosystems of North America (Covington et al. 1994). 
Apart from grazing, the fire-exclusion period at La 
Michilia does not coincide with any major change in cli- 
mate (Stahle & Cleaveland 1993), large-scale forest har- 
vesting (P.Z.F. et al., unpublished data), or other appar- 
ent landscape change. Deliberate fire suppression is 
practiced but consists mainly of local landowners with 
hand tools and pickup trucks, sometimes supplemented 
by army troops. 
Conservation and Restoration of Ecosystems 
The maintenance of a frequent-fire regime in the core is 
a striking confirmation of the value of the biosphere re- 
serve at this site. We don't know how many frequently 
burning sites remain in the Sierra Madre Occidental; so 
far only two such sites have been documented in addi- 
tion to site PG (the others are Arroyo Laureles, Durango 
[Fule & Covington 1996, 1997], and Sierra Ajo, Sonora 
[Baisan & Swetnam 1995]). Site PG is the only docu-

mented site under protected management, underscoring 
the importance of continued conservation of La Michilia. 
(The possibility was recently raised of trading the gov- 
ernment-owned reserve core to meet other state com- 
mitments.) The past preservation of the frequent-fire re- 
gime and unharvested forest structure of Cerro Blanco, 
the mountain that includes site PG, was an unintentional 
consequence of the remote, rugged nature of the moun- 
tain. In contrast to the current broad recognition of the 
ecological role of fire, no particular consideration ap- 
pears to have been given to fire when the reserve was 
designed in the 1970s by a team of biologists, ecologists, 
and anthropologists (Barbault 1978; Gallina et al. 1978; 
Halffter 1978), supporting the idea that conserving eco- 
systems in relatively natural conditions will help sustain 
important ecological elements that are presently un- 
known or unappreciated. In some cases these unknown 
critical elements, perhaps a particular microorganism or 
rare plant, may be easy to overlook. But in the present 
case the unrecognized element appears obvious in hind- 
sight: fires crossing the landscape, even low-intensity 
fires, tend to be fairly conspicuous. 
A primary application of detailed fire-regime data is to 
assist managers to maintain or restore natural distur- 
bance regimes into the future. But regimes can probably 
be maintained only in reserves that are several times the 
maximum disturbance size and that are located to con- 
tain disturbances within their borders (Baker 1992). The 
7000-ha core area of La Michilia is small compared to 
large-scale ecological processes such as contagious dis- 
turbances (e.g., fire) and ranges of larger animals (e.g., 
mountain lion [Puma concolor]), it doesn't represent the 
major lower-elevation ecological types such as oak-pine 
forest or grassland, and this small reserve constitutes the 
only protected forest area for hundreds of kilometers. 
The reserve core is unlikely to maintain a frequent-fire 
regime-or 
many other natural ecosystem attributes- 
indefinitely. Furthermore, exclusively protected areas in 
Mexico, such as national parks and biosphere reserve 
cores, are unlikely to increase because of the strong 
pressure for lands to meet the needs of growing human 
populations. 
Expanding the effectiveness of small reserves by ac- 
tively restoring ecosystems surrounding and connecting 
protected lands offers promise for sustaining natural bio- 
logical diversity at far larger scales (Hobbs & Norton 
1996) and may be the only hope for ecosystem conserva- 
tion at the scales required to sustain large predator spe- 
cies (Noss et al. 1996). Ecological restoration is not a 
panacea for the pressing problems of social inequity that 
contribute to ecosystem degradation in northern Mex- 
ico. Management plans for this region, including conser- 
vation and restoration strategies, can be designed only in 
a local context. Speaking as outsiders, however, we sug- 
gest that the following points may merit consideration in 
restoration initiatives. First, because many important 
ecological factors are imperfectly understood, reserves 
themselves should be managed conservatively (Della- 
salla et al. 1996), with scientifically based restorative ac- 
tions initiated first in buffer areas. The greatest learning 
opportunity exists where restoration treatments are de- 
signed as experiments. Second, given the many social 
challenges facing conservation in Mexico (Simonian 
1995), management plans are most likely to succeed if 
landowners see direct benefits to their natural re- 
sources. In the case of forests adapted to frequent fire, 
thinning and burning treatments designed to restore nat- 
ural ecosystem structure and function can improve for- 
age production, soil moisture relations, and tree growth 
while reducing the risk of high-intensity wildfire (e.g., 
Covington et al. 1997). Not every restoration treatment 
will be beneficial to conservation and resource extrac- 
tion goals simultaneously, of course, but even moderate 
steps favoring natural ecological processes are likely to 
be an improvement over the status quo. Considering 
the relatively short period of fire exclusion in forests 
of the Sierra Madre Occidental, some of these ecosys- 
tems may escape the more deleterious effects of fire- 
regime disruption if conservation and restoration activi- 
ties succeed.
