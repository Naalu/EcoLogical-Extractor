ABSTRACT—Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of the southwestern United States have changed
dramatically over the past century, primarily in response to grazing, logging, and ﬁre suppression practices. As
a result, forest restoration treatments are gaining attention as a forest management tool for reducing ﬁre risk
and improving ecological function of the forest. We trapped and radiocollared Abert’s squirrels (Sciurus aberti)
in restoration-treated ponderosa pine forests to determine changes in home range sizes as a result of
restoration treatments. We report evidence that winter vs. nonwinter home range of Abert’s squirrels was not
different pre- vs. posttreatment. These results are important for land managers in designing forest treatments
that reduce the risk of stand-replacing wildﬁre while providing habitat for the Abert’s squirrel.
RESUMEN—Los bosques de pino ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa) del suroeste de los Estados Unidos han
cambiado dr´asticamente en el ´ultimo siglo, principalmente en respuesta al pastoreo, tala y pr´acticas para evitar
incendios forestales. Como resultado, los tratamientos de restauraci´on del bosque llegan a ser importantes
como herramienta de manejo para disminuir el riesgo de incendios y para mejorar la funci´on del bosque en el
ecosistema. Atrapamos y les pusimos collares de radiotransmisores a ardillas de Abert (Sciurus aberti) en los
bosques de pino ponderosa con tratamiento de restauraci´on para determinar cambios en los tama˜nos de
rangos de hogar resultantes de los tratamientos de restauraci´on. Reportamos que el rango de hogar del
invierno versus no invierno de la ardilla Abert no fue diferente antes o despu´es del tratamiento. Estos
resultados son importantes para los administradores del terreno para dise˜nar los tratamientos de los bosques
que reduzcan el riesgo de incendios forestales mientras provean el h´abitat a la ardilla Abert.
The Abert’s squirrel (Sciurus aberti) is dependent on
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) for food and cover
(Keith, 1965; Farentinos, 1972; Dodd et al., 2003). Their
diet consists almost exclusively of ponderosa pine tissue
(seeds, seeds from cones, and phloem) or plants and
fungi closely associated with ponderosa pine (Keith, 1965;
Stephenson, 1975; States et al., 1988; Austin, 1990;
Snyder, 1992). Nests are typically placed in the upper
branches of large (37.5–57.5-cm diameter at breast
height) ponderosa pines (Halloran and Bekoff, 1994;
Snyder and Linhart, 1994). Although squirrels depend
upon the pine throughout the year, habitat quality is
especially critical in winter when their primary food
source is the phloem of a chemically unique subset of
trees containing physiologically important elements
(Hall, 1981; Zhang and States, 1991; Snyder, 1992). These
‘‘feed trees’’ are typically found in clumps that are
distributed throughout a forest patch (States et al.,
1988; Linhart, 1989). The ability of a squirrel to access
these clumps via interlocking canopy corridors becomes
increasingly important during winter when snow accu-
mulation can impede ground travel and increase suscep-
tibility to predation (Stephenson and Brown, 1980).
Previous studies have suggested that winter survival is
the limiting factor for Abert’s squirrel populations
(Loberger et al., 2011).
Over the past 150 years, ponderosa pine forests of the
American Southwest have shifted from relatively open,
park-like stands with clumps of large-diameter trees
(Cooper, 1960; White, 1985) to dense stands of small-
diameter trees with very few open areas (Covington and
Moore, 1994). Because these dense stands are vulnerable
to high-intensity wildﬁres, managers of ponderosa pine
forests in the American Southwest have responded by
attempting to restore presettlement stand structure and
return low-intensity ﬁre to this ﬁre-adapted landscape
(Allen et al., 2002). This management approach can
reduce basal area and trees per acre (Ful´e et al., 2001) and
allow the herbaceous understory to reestablish (Moore et
al., 2006). The resulting forest is more open, allows for a
more productive understory, and has a mosaic forest
structure of tree clumps of varying densities and sizes.
Previous studies have suggested that landscape-scale
restoration treatments could potentially decrease density

and recruitment of Abert’s squirrels if treatments cause
overall basal area and the number of interlocking tree
canopies to fall below critical levels (Dodd et al., 2006). In
addition to reducing food and nest site availability, forest
restoration could increase squirrel mortality by reducing
the amount of interlocking canopies that squirrels use as
pathways for escaping predators (Austin, 1990; Dodd et
al., 2003). Although some researchers have suggested that
up to 75% of a forested landscape can be treated and still
provide suitable squirrel habitat if treatments are applied
as a mosaic of patches (Dodd et al., 2006), few studies
have examined how individual squirrels respond in
forests where restoration treatments have been conduct-
ed. Further, few have examined the appropriate size or
conﬁguration of denser patches for the Abert’s squirrel.
In this study we evaluated seasonal home range and
quantiﬁed habitat selection by Abert’s squirrel in a
treated landscape.
MATERIALS AND METHODS—Study Area—We conducted the study
at two sites: Mountainaire and Airport. The Mountainaire study
site (358120N, 1118660W; Fig. 1) was located southeast of
Flagstaff, Arizona, between Lake Mary Road and Interstate 17.
The area includes 6,180 ha of Coconino National Forest on the
Mormon Lake Ranger District and 539 ha of private land. The
Mountainaire study site was an experimental prescription that
included three distinct forest components: winter core areas
(WCAs, formerly referred to as ‘‘meso-reserves’’), matrix
(minimally thinned), and full restoration (Dodd et al., 2003),
which was modiﬁed to accommodate existing stand conditions
and fuel reduction objectives speciﬁc to the Mountainaire
Project (United States Forest Service, 2013). The description of
the three forest components is based on Dodd et al. (2003), but
varies slightly from those recommendations to accommodate
existing stand conditions and fuel reduction needs speciﬁc to
the Mountainaire Project. The WCAs were 20–36 ha each, with a
basal area ranging from 10 to 15 m2ha and canopy closure
ranging from 55% to 72%. This combination of prescriptions
was developed to maximize squirrel density and recruitment
while meeting other ecological restoration goals, such as
reduction of risk to wildﬁre, and improved tree vigor. The
WCAs had higher basal area and extensive interlocking canopies
that provide habitat for squirrel nest placement, movements,
and protection from predators.
The Airport study site (358130N, 1118670W; Fig. 1) encom-
passed approximately 54 ha immediately adjacent to Pulliam
Airport, east of Interstate 17, on lands owned by the city of
Flagstaff, Arizona. The management of this area was developed
by the Flagstaff Fire Department, Arizona Game and Fish
Department, Greater Flagstaff Forests Partnership, and North-
ern Arizona University Ecological Restoration Institute and
School of Forestry. The prescription emphasized mechanical
thinning to recreate presettlement forest conditions on 43 ha.
Tree-thinning treatments were based on site-speciﬁc reconstruc-
tion of preﬁre exclusion forest density and spatial arrangement
using principles described by Moore et al. (1999).
All trees >24-cm diameter at breast height in the treatment
areas were retained during treatment operations performed by
the U.S. Forest Service. Groups and clumps of ponderosa pine
trees varied in shape, size, and number of trees, and were
irregularly shaped. Groups were located perpendicular to
prevailing wind to reduce ﬁre hazard. Slash from harvested
trees was chipped and hauled off-site. The prescription included
retention of 2 WCAs (4 and 7 ha) within the treatment area.
These WCAs were considerably smaller than those implemented
on the Mountainaire project (27–90 ha) and were spatially
arranged within the treatment to observe squirrel use of smaller,
dense patches nested within a larger treatment area. Treatments
were completed in September 2009.
Collection and Analysis of Data—From 21 April 2010 to 15 June
2010, we captured squirrels using wire-mesh box traps (Model
202; Tomahawk Live Trap Co., Tomahawk, Wisconsin) baited
with shelled, unsalted, raw peanuts. We baited the traps in the
morning and checked in the late afternoon. To incorporate
several combinations of forest restoration patches, we placed 4
10 · 10 trap grids on the study area. We placed the traps 50 m
apart.
We immobilized captured squirrels with an inhalation
anesthetic, isoﬂurane (IsoFlo; Abbott Laboratories, North
Chicago, Illinois), and ﬁtted each with a 15-g VHF radio-
transmitter (Model CHP-3P; Telonics, Mesa, Arizona). In all
cases, transmitters were <3% of body mass. We weighed and
determined sex of each captured squirrel and classiﬁed those
weighing >550 g as adults (Keith, 1965; Farentinos, 1972; Dodd
et al., 2003). We released squirrels at the capture site after a 15-
min anesthetic recovery period.
We used a directional hand-held antenna to track squirrels
throughout the year for 18 months, locating each squirrel ‡2
times/week and scheduling searches to equally sample morning,
afternoon, and late-afternoon periods. We recorded each
animal’s location using Universal Transverse Mercator coordi-

nates obtained from a hand-held Global Positioning System unit
after the unit achieved an accuracy of 8 m.
We produced ﬁxed-kernel seasonal core areas and 85% ﬁxed-
kernel seasonal ranges (Worton, 1989) using ArcGIS 9.3.1 Home
Range Tool adapted from ArcView 3.3 Home Range Extension
(Rogers and Carr, 1998) with a least-squares cross-validation
smoothing parameter (Worton, 1995; Seaman and Powell, 1996;
Seaman et al., 1999) for six squirrels that were tracked in 2005,
2006, and 2007 at the Mountainaire study site. These data were
collected during a previous study. We focused our analysis efforts
on the posttreatment results but used pretreatment data for
comparison purposes.
We partitioned location data from 2005 to 2007 and 2010 to
2011 into two seasons: winter (1 November–31 March) and
nonwinter (1 April–31 October), based on snowfall and seasonal
shifts in squirrel diet. For each season, we estimated 50% ﬁxed-
kernel seasonal core areas and 85% ﬁxed-kernel seasonal ranges
(Worton, 1989) using ArcGIS 9.3.1 Home Range Tool adapted
from ArcView 3.3 Home Range Extension (Rogers and Carr,
1998) with a least-squares cross-validation smoothing parameter
(Worton, 1995; Seaman and Powell, 1996; Seaman et al., 1999).
We determined that home range estimates stabilized after 21
locations were used (Seaman et al., 1999), and we subsequently
calculated home ranges only for squirrels with ‡21 locations in
each season. We tracked only adult squirrels and had only one
female with ‡21 locations. We pooled all squirrels within sites,
consistent with t-test results from Loberger et al. (2011). Data
were normal based on Shapiro–Wilk’s tests. We used a Welch
analysis of variance (Welch, 1938) to test for homogeneity of
variance (JMP 10; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina). We
obtained raster data for basal area and canopy cover with a 1-m
resolution from Forest-ERA (Forest Ecosystem Restoration
Analysis, Flagstaff, Arizona). We assigned 3 canopy classes (0–
30%, 31–40%, ‡41%) and 5 basal-area classes (0–35, 36–75, 76–
100, 101–125, ‡126). We used ArcGIS 9.3.1 to determine the
proportion of all squirrel locations recorded in each of the
treatment types at the two study sites.
We estimated second-order availability of forest structure
characteristics at home range scale (Johnson, 1980), based on
the relative amounts of three canopy-cover classes and ﬁve basal-
area classes within the minimum convex polygon created from
all radiolocations of squirrels captured in each study area
(Guthery et al., 2005). We estimated second-order use as either
the composition within the 50% ﬁxed-kernel core area or within
the 85% ﬁxed-kernel home range. We compared composition
within each individual 50% core area or 85% kernel home range
to the composition within the broader study area. We evaluated
third-order selection by considering the habitat within an
individual’s seasonal 85% ﬁxed-kernel home range as available
and habitat at each individual radiolocation as use.
We used compositional analysis to determine whether habitat
use differed from random and to rank habitat preference when
statistically signiﬁcant differences existed between availability
and use (Aitchison, 1986; Aebischer et al., 1993). Compositional
analysis avoids the problems of radiolocation serial correlation
by using the animal as the sampling unit and addresses the issue
of nonindependence by using log-ratio transformation of the
habitat proportions (Aebischer et al., 1993). Compositional
analysis is recommended for sample sizes ‡10 individuals
(Aebischer et al., 1993); we included all squirrels with ‡15
locations in this analysis, which gave us 8 total individuals. We
followed Bingham and Brennen (2004), substituting values of
0.007, rather than 0.0 for habitat classes where a squirrel was
never located. We used a MANOVA analysis in SAS to determine
whether use differed from random for habitat selection at the
second and third orders.
RESULTS—We calculated ﬁxed-kernel-density home-
range estimates for ﬁve squirrels. We captured 20 at the
Mountainaire study site and 12 at the Airport study site,
yet we could only use 5 for the analysis. We found no
difference in 85% home range or 50% core range
between the two study sites (Table 1). We used a Student’s
t-test to compare 50% core and 85% home ranges for
squirrels at the Mountainaire study site with those at the
Airport study site and found no difference (P > 0.05). We
found that the mean 85% ﬁxed-kernel home range for
winter (6.76 ha, SD = 2.43) was not signiﬁcantly different
from that for nonwinter (7.56 ha, SD = 2.85). The mean
50% ﬁxed-kernel core area for winter (2.51, SD = 1.02)
was not signiﬁcantly different from the mean in non-
winter (2.52 ha, SD = 1.18). Squirrels used 50% core areas
with basal area ‡101 m2/ha more than expected in winter
(F = 361.86, P < 0.0001) and used 85% home ranges with
basal area ‡101 more than expected in nonwinter (F =
7.05, P < 0.05) when compared with availability within the
study area. Squirrels selected 50% core home ranges with
canopy cover ‡31% more often than expected in both

seasons (nonwinter: F = 6.75, P = 0.0291; winter: F =
15.79, P = 0.0041). We pooled all squirrels within sites,
consistent with t-test results from Loberger et al. (2011).
We found no support for selection for speciﬁc basal
area (winter: F = 2.50, P = 0.1987; nonwinter: F = 1.14, P
= 0.4499) or canopy cover (winter: F = 0.71, P = 0.5302;
nonwinter: F = 1.92, P = 0.2225) categories in either
season when selection was based on individual radio-
locations (third-order selection). During those pretreat-
ment years, we found that squirrels had smaller home
ranges in winter than in nonwinter; our posttreatment
data from the Mountainaire study site show no difference
in home range size by season (Table 2).
DISCUSSION—Based on a sample size of 10, we found
that there was no difference in home range size of
squirrels across seasons or across years. This is of
importance because of the varied size of WCAs across
study sites. Our research illustrates that it is plausible to
provide habitat for wildlife that require denser forest
conditions while also reducing the risk of stand-replacing
wildﬁre. A stand-replacing ﬁre is a ﬁre that kills all or
most of the living upper canopy layer and initiates success
or regrowth (Smith, 2000). The Airport study site WCAs
were much smaller than the Mountainaire WCAs (4 and 7
ha vs. 40 ha). The difference in WCA size is also relevant
in regard to forest restoration and providing habitat
requirements for squirrels. Although many studies have
shown that forest restoration activities result in a decline
in squirrel abundance, our results show that treated areas
that contain smaller WCAs (i.e., areas with high basal area
and canopy cover) can provide winter habitat and still
reduce the risk of stand-replacing wildﬁre. These areas
are thought to be especially important during winter
months when snow impedes squirrel movements. Howev-
er, we did not see heavy snow amounts during our study.
The differences in home range size for pre- and
posttreatment could indicate changes in squirrel habitat
selection posttreatment. Squirrels may have needed to
travel farther distances posttreatment during winter to
forage or to ﬁnd necessary habitat requirements, and they
were able to do so because of the comparatively lower
snowfall during our study (1,026 cm in 2005–2007, 978
cm in 2010–2011) compared with the 50-year average of
1,351 cm (Western Regional Climate Center; http://www.
wrcc.dri.edu/). We found average posttreatment non-
winter home-range sizes to be consistent with the
pretreatment study results (Table 2), which adds support
for current ponderosa pine forest management approach-
es related to squirrel habitat.
