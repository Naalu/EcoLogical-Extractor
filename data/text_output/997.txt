Abstract: Biomass amounts predicted by generalized models are often not applicable for small
regions. Localized allometric models were developed relating tree/biomass components to diameter
at breast height (dbh) for coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl.) from an industrial
timberland in northwestern California, USA. dbh for the candidate trees ranged from 2.54 cm to
84.07 cm. Biomass of tree components, such as bole, foliage, bark, live and dead branches, along with
the total aboveground biomass (TAGB) were estimated. Other tree dimensions such as tree height,
height to live crown, weight and volume of bole wood were also modeled. Localized allometric
models were able to explain more than 93% of the variability for most of the tree components
(p < 0.001). Biomass amounts predicted from the widely used generalized models were different
from that estimated by the localized allometric model developed from this study. However, the
results presented in this study should be used carefully to predict the biomass components, if applied
outside the stated dbh range or stand conditions on which this study was based.

1. Introduction
Predicting the biomass of various tree parts using allometric models is crucial in multiple
disciplines including forest utilization, management, and ecology. An allometric equation is a formula
that helps quantitatively explain the relationship between various tree (or biomass) components and
measurable tree attributes. Allometric models can be applied to all trees regardless of size, as long as
they are growing under the same conditions [1]. These models consist of measureable independent
variables, such as tree diameter or height, and have been used to obtain structural and functional
characteristics for estimating biomass, net primary production, and biogeochemical budgets for forest
ecosystems [2,3]. Traditionally, the determination of aboveground tree biomass and structural tree
dimensions (for instance height of the live crown, height of the tree, weight, and volume of bole)
was conducted to ensure sustainable planning of forest resources [4] and to determine amounts of
carbon and carbon sequestration rates [5,6]. Currently, biomass models are ﬁnding a wide variety of
other applications. They have been applied in predicting crown ﬁre behavior [7], estimating potential
conditions for drought, insect and disease outbreaks [8], estimating tree volume in remote sensing [9],
and determining productivity and actual amount of biomass recovered during forest harvesting
operations [10,11].
The US Forest Service has compiled a list of the most well-known published diameter-based
biomass models for major tree species throughout the nation [5,6,12–14]. Yet, most of these generalized

regional models are not suited for stand speciﬁc estimates, resulting in a need for localized allometric
models. The need for localized models becomes even more crucial when the species of interest have
high timber value or when accurate estimates are needed for various research activities.
In northwestern California, redwood trees (Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl.) are a major
commercial timber species. Redwood forests are found in 12 counties of California. However, more
than 75% of the redwood forests are concentrated in three northern counties—Del Norte, Humboldt,
and Mendocino [15]. From 1978 to 2011, on average, the price for redwood timber has increased
by 2.4% annually. From 1984 to 2000, the price saw a rapid increase, at almost 10.2%. As a result,
redwoods are today considered to be the most valuable tree species in California, and are extensively
used for fencing, decking, and paneling [16]. Additionally, coast redwood trees are the tallest in the
world, adding further signiﬁcance from an ecological standpoint. The redwood forests are considered
to have the highest terrestrial biomass levels on earth (>3000 Mg¨ ha´1) [17–19]. However, there have
hardly been any localized allometric models developed to predict the total aboveground biomass
(TAGB) and other tree components for coast redwood. This might be due to the difﬁculties associated
with destructive sampling. Today, the most widely used models for predicting biomass in redwoods
are generic allometric models published on a national level scale developed for cedar and larch [5,6,12].
Other allometric models developed for predicting stem volume for redwood trees had diameter
at breast height (dbh) less than 10 cm (n = 9) [17–19]. However, due to its narrow dbh range, the
applicability of this model is very limited. Other studies done on coast redwood includes, determining
mensurational relationships for estimating the gross volume and taper for bolewood using dbh [20–24].
The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) also has models to estimate the tree gross volume for trees
above 13 cm in diameter [22–25].
This study developed a localized allometric model for estimating TAGB in oven-dry kilograms
(ODKg) for coast redwood in northwestern California based on the tree dbh. Regression models
were also developed for other tree components such as bole (stem), bark, branch, foliage, live and
dead branches using dbh in ODKg (Table 1). Tree dimension components such as height of the tree,
height to live crown, weight and volume of bole were also regressed to develop allometric models.
The allometric model developed by this study was further compared to the existing national level
models and the models used in the FIA model [5,6,12,21–25].

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Description of Coast Redwood
The coast redwoods (family: Cupressaceae), named after the color of their bark and heartwood,
are evergreen, long-living (in some cases more than 2200 years), monoecious trees endemic to the
Paciﬁc temperate rainforest eco-region [26–28]. They naturally occur from southern Oregon to central
California within a relatively narrow strip (50 km) along the Paciﬁc Ocean [29,30]. Hence, these trees
are also referred to California redwood. The coast redwoods thrive in the moist, humid coastal climate,
where marine fog provides favorable conditions necessary for their growth. Exceptionally massive
stands of redwoods occur in the central redwood forest, which ranges from southern Humboldt County
to San Francisco Bay [28]. Redwood self-prunes well in dense stands and the base of the bole in natural
conditions is strongly buttressed. The ﬁbrous bark of the tree can reach up to 30 cm in thickness [31].
Old growth trees can attain heights of 61 m with many reaching over 91 m. Such trees could reach dbh
of up to 610 cm [30].
2.2. Study Sites
The candidate trees used for this study were selected from an industrial timberland property
approximately 15 km from the Paciﬁc coast in Humboldt County, California (123˝56117” W and
40˝57151” N) (Figure 1). The dominant species in the study area consisted of even-aged second growth
redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziessii (Mirb.) Franco), western hemlock
(Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.), and tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiﬂorus (Hook. & Arn.) Rehd.), with
stands averaging 60 years in age. The sites were located approximately 220 to 460 m above mean
sea level with ground slopes ranging from ﬂat terrain to 111% (48˝). The climate for the region is
characterized by summers averaging 29 ˝C, and winter being cool and wet averaging 8 ˝C. On average,
the region receives 1200 mm of rain annually, mostly from December through April [32]. Furthermore,
the study sites fall within the Paciﬁc temperate rainforests ecoregion, which are amongst the richest
and most diverse temperate forests in the world [33]. The study region probably has a ﬁre return
interval of less than 100 years [34]. However, after the ﬁre suppression policies instigated in 1900s, ﬁre
occurrences have greatly reduced for at least the last 50 years [35,36]. According to forest management
records, trees were planted via aerial seed spraying and the stands were not thinned.

2.3. Sampling Procedures and Data Collection
A stand inventory was done at 10% sampling intensity using 11 m line transects for 0.04 ha
ﬁxed-radius circular sampling plots and recorded species, height, and dbh for all standing trees over
2.54 cm (Table 2). The sample plots were evenly spaced at 76 m on transects lines drawn at random
azimuths. The average basal area and dbh for the redwood trees in the two stands were 3.14 m2¨ ha´1
and 21.89 cm, respectively. The average tree density was around 296 trees per hectare with an average
dbh of around 10 cm (both these values includes all species).

species below 15.24 cm dbh).
Twenty-nine trees, spanning a range of dbh from 2.54 cm to 84.07 cm (Table 3), were selected
for destructive sampling following the methods outlined by Monserud and Marshall [37]. The stand
inventory showed that this diameter range encompassed 99% of the redwood trees in the study site.
A minimum of two trees were selected from all dbh classes observed in the sample plot inventories.
Candidate trees excluded those that were open grown, obviously deformed, defected, and diseased.
Trees were selected across two stands so that concentrations of either species or size classes in one
stand were avoided. Moreover, trees that were adjacent to recent clear-cuts were given priority in the
candidate tree selection process because the various tree components were more effectively recoverable
(Table 1). Other non-candidate trees were cleared from the area to assist the feller with landing the
candidate trees while reducing breakage. Trees selected for sampling were felled at the soil surface
by a professional faller into nearby roadways or clearings to reduce stem breakage and loss of crown
components in an attempt to facilitate sampling techniques. Sampling was initiated by compartilizing
the tree into bole, branches (live and dead), and foliage.

2.4. Bole Measurements
The bole was divided into 1.52 m sections from the bottom to the top of the live crown. For each
section, the large- and small-end diameters were measured (to the nearest centimeter) until the top
2.54 cm. The outer bark diameter was measured at the stump top (0.31 m above the ground) and
ground level, to account for stump volume (Table 1). A millimeter caliper was used to measure bark
thickness, at the same location where the outside bark diameter was measured. Finally, length to the
tip of the crown and diameter at the tip were recorded. To obtain bole wood densities, three sample
disks (approximately 2.54 cm thick) were cut from the lower, middle, and upper portions of the bole.
The bark was removed from the wood, and both components were sent to the lab for further analysis.
2.5. Branch Measurements
The crown was divided into three equal sections from the base to the tip of the tree. Within each
section, the largest and two randomly selected sample branches were removed with a chainsaw [38].
To facilitate measurements, all branches were cut into portions of approximately 1–2 m in length and
then weighed in the ﬁeld for calculating the fresh weight. The branches were further classiﬁed as
dead and live. The dead branches were below the live crown and were leaﬂess, and brittle. The live
branches constituted from the ﬁrst live branch up till the tip of the crown.
“Branch-summation” was the approach taken to estimate the branch-level measurement. Samples
of live and dead branch on the stem were measured for basal diameter to the nearest 0.25 cm using
calipers. In addition, length, and distance from the tip of the tree top to the branch node were also
measured. The fresh weights of all sample branches less than 15 cm were measured in the ﬁeld. Bigger
samples of branches removed were labeled and kept, while the rest were discarded. During sampling,
each branch location was marked on the stem to avoid double counting. The tree was then rolled over
to measure branches on the other side. If a branch was missing due to breakage, the branch basal
diameter was measured at the stem and branch weight was later estimated using regression models
developed for the measured branches.
2.6. Laboratory Measurements
The volume and density of wood (debarked discs/cookies) were calculated using the water
displacement method. The volume of wood was determined from the volume of water displaced
when submerged. The wood density was estimated as the oven dry weight divided by the volume.
Drying was done at a temperature of 105 ˘ 2 ˝C and the dry weight of the samples were achieved
when the change of weight was less than 0.2% within a 60 m period [39]. Additionally, the wood
density and bark to wood weight ratio was calculated for each tree by averaging the speciﬁc gravities
obtained from respective cookies of the tree bole. Needles, branches, wood discs, and bark were
weighed separately to calculate the speciﬁc dry to fresh weight ratios.

The branch weights were regressed against their respective basal diameter, length, and distance
from the tree top, for estimating the weight of each unsampled component for every branch. These
regression models were developed combining measurements from all trees and was transformed
using natural logarithm. The oven dry weights for unsampled tree components were calculated by
multiplying fresh weight with dry/wet ratio of each sample component [4]. The total oven dry biomass
of each stem was then calculated by summing the dry biomass over all stem sections. The biomass in
each section (i.e., bole, foliage, bark, live, and dead branches) were summed to obtain the TAGB for
each tree. The bole wood volume was estimated using Smalian’s formula, which was later converted
to weight by applying the speciﬁc gravity of stem wood cookies (dry weight/wet volume) derived
from water displacement.
2.7. Statistical Analysis
The tree components estimated in this study were bole (stem), bark, foliage (needle), live and
dead branches from which the TAGB was estimated. Allometric models were also developed for
tree dimensions, such as height to live crown, total height of the tree (H), weight, and volume of
bole (Table 1). Before establishing the allometric model, scatter plots were used to check whether
the relationships between transformed independent and dependent variables were linear. Several
transformation models were developed and compared; however, logarithmic transformed models with
base 10 were selected [40]. Therefore, all allometric models reported for this study used logarithmic
transformation with base 10 of various tree components, dimensions and dbh as independent variables
for the regression. The logarithmic transformation equalized the variance over the entire range of
biomass components and satisﬁed the assumptions of linear regression [4,41,42]. Multi-collinearity
was tested using a tolerance value greater than 0.1 and variance inﬂation factor less than 10. Eleven
models similar to the published biomass equations were developed for predicting respective biomass
and tree dimensions in SAS statistical program version 9.3 [43]. Models were transformed back to
the original units and corrected for bias using a correction factor (CF) for each model [44]. The R2
reported for the regression model was calculated before it was back-transformed. The general form of
allometric models reported was:
log10 pBq “ a ` b log10 pdbhq ` CF
where: B—Total biomass of the tree component (ODKg) or tree dimensions; dbh—Diameter at
breast height (cm); log to base 10 a; b—Regression coefﬁcients; Correction factor—CF “
SE2
2 ;
SE—standard error.
3. Results and Discussion
Eleven allometric coefﬁcients were developed for coast redwood to predict biomass in
various tree components and other structural tree dimensions by sampling trees from an industrial
timberland (Table 4).
The TAGB estimated for this study, averaged at 910.56 ODKg and ranged from 1.20 to 3018.40
ODKg (n = 29). The average height of the candidate trees was 26.09 m, ranging from 9.45 to 34.05 m
(n = 26, the three saplings were not included). The logarithmic transformed model (based on dbh)
provided a highly signiﬁcant (p < 0.001) ﬁt for the all tree components (Figure 2) and met all of the
assumptions for regression. Additionally, the residual plots and quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots were
also inspected to conﬁrm the validity of the model. All components were estimated in ODKg based on
log to the base of 10 and produced R2 values ranging from 55% to 99% for the log transformed models
(Table 4). Biomass for dead branches (R2 = 0.58) and the height to live crown using dbh (R2 = 0.55)
explained the least amount of variability among the various tree components and dimensions reported.
When dbh was modeled for predicting the speciﬁc gravity and bark to stem wood ratio, very low
R2 values (ď0.04) were generated and did not meet several assumptions of normality for regression.

The speciﬁc gravity of the wood estimated for the study ranged between 0.37 and 0.48, which fell in the
range for the Cupressaceae family (i.e., median speciﬁc gravity 0.43) estimated by Chojnacky et al. [6].
Interestingly, during the development of this database no redwood trees were included [6]. While
the oven-dry weight for wood (comprising merchantable sawlog) and volume of bole were estimated
from a timber production point of view, TAGB and other tree component models were generated
considering the ecological signiﬁcance of the species in the region.
The destructive sampling techniques used to create allometric model for this study did not
completely sample the crown. Instead, the total biomass of the crown was estimated by regressing
branch weight based on basal diameter and other parameters, rather than crown mass ratio [4,37].
Models for estimating TAGB and foliage were developed using 29 trees, while all other tree
components were estimated using 26 trees because the additional three trees were 1–3 years old
saplings (dbh below 6.35 cm) (Table 3). Regressions done on the live, and dead branch components
using 29 trees lowered the R2 from 0.88 to 0.79 and 0.57 to 0.13 respectively. The high reduction
in R2 for the dead branches were due to low sampling population for the saplings. Consequently,
for these biomass components, models having 29 observations were also not included in the ﬁnal
results. Allometric models developed for other species, like Cordia alliodora, have also shown similar
trends, with trees (saplings) with diameter lesser than 5 cm not generating reasonable prediction
(R2 = 0.02) [45]. This possibly suggests that dbh might not perhaps be a good indicator of biomass
components and tree dimensions for small diameter trees. Enquist [46] explains that ﬁtting data
for shrubs and saplings (with relatively few branches) can result in different exponents from trees.
Additionally, the very concept behind scaling theories is based on sample populations being consistent
across size classes; ﬁtting models to sub-sets of data is contrary to that principle [44,47,48]. Hence, the
dbh range for TAGB and foliage was 2.54–84.07 cm and for all other tree components and dimensions
were 8.25–84.07 cm.

were expressed in oven dry kilograms (ODKg); except for total height (H) and height to live crown

aboveground biomass (TAGB) and foliage (n = 29). All models and their parameters were signiﬁcant
at p < 0.001.

(5) bark and tree dimensions; (6) weight of wood; (7) height to live crown; (8) height of tree; and
(9) volume of bole. All models were signiﬁcant (p < 0.001).
3.1. Model Selection
Attempts were made to develop models for estimating TAGB and volume of bole wood based on
both dbh and H. However, both these models only had a slight increase in R2, (around 2% increase
compared to R2 for the model only with dbh) and it had higher Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
(~134) than the dbh based model (AIC~108), suggesting that the model with both dbh and H was a bad
ﬁt. Or in other words, H did not contribute more to the reduction in mean square error than the loss of
a degree of freedom cost. Additionally, dbh and H of trees are usually highly correlated for trees from
the same site [49]. Coon’s [50] efforts on validating existing biomass models for Douglas-ﬁr uncovered
a strong bias for managed stands where the relationship between H and dbh had been manipulated
through thinning and fertilization. For estimating the height to live crown, the allometric equation
using H as the independent variable was able to explain more variance (R2 = 0.88) as compared to dbh
(R2 = 0.50). However, the dbh model was also reported, as dbh is a convenient independent variable
that can be easily measured in the ﬁeld.
3.2. Comparing with Previous Studies
The results of this study were not compared with the models developed by Fujimori [17] due
to its limited dbh range (less than 10 cm) and the study being carried out in a different ecological

conditions (i.e., old growth stand). However, the model developed in this study was compared with
the widely used model to predict TAGB for coast redwood trees (Equation (1)) [12] and recently
developed (Equation (2)) [6]. The models developed by Jenkins et al. [12] for Equation (1) were initially
modeled for a species group called “Cedar–Larch” and consisted of meta-data from ﬁve genera of
trees. The recently developed model had three subsets of equations for the Cupressaceae family based
on the median speciﬁc gravity (i.e., 0.29, 0.34 and 0.43) [6]. For this comparison, Equation (2) which
has median speciﬁc gravity of 0.43, was chosen because the speciﬁc gravity for wood in this study
averaged 0.40.

where ln—natural log to base “e” (2.7182); TAGB—total aboveground biomass in ODKg; dbh—diameter
at breast height (cm).
Results showed the national generalized models had different effects when compared to the
localized equation developed for the study. While Equation (1) tended to underrepresent TAGB
by approximately 14%, Equation (2) over-represented (Figure 3). The deﬂection from the values
predicted by the localized equation increased with increments in dbh. However, the values of “b”
coefﬁcient from both generic models were found to be very similar to the value developed in this
study (2.2592 and 2.4757 vs. 2.2607). The minimal change could be attributed to the 'local' inﬂuence in
this study compared to the more extensive area and wider range of species used for the nationalized
model. Previous research has also recorded this inconsistency for other species while estimating TAGB
using generalized models for local regions [51,52]. Additionally, comparisons were done with the
models used by the FIA to predict biomass present in the bolewood [22–24]. The results showed that
FIA models under represented biomass in bole by around 24%.
Figure 3. Graph of localized allometric models compared with Jenkins et al. [12] and Chojnacky et al. [6]
for predicting total aboveground biomass of coast redwood in Oven Dry Kilogram (ODKg) against
dbh (diameter at breast height).
Berrill et al. [53] reported that in redwood trees several factors, such as H, crown ratio, and H:
dbh ratio were often affected to different degreees by stand density which must therefore impact the
TAGB and other biomass components. Thus, the model provided in this study may be more suitable
for research and management decisions for the second growth even-aged timberstands.
The study site represented a typical industrial timberland in the region based on species
composition, terrain features and basal area factors. Models for estimating biomass for other species
have also been done on small sampling area, and population size, especially for artiﬁcially planted
industrial timberland in temperate regions where species variability is lesser when compared to natural
tropical forest having higher variability among and within species. The case is also similar for single

species than for a group of species [1]. Sampling area in natural habitats has also been as low as with
19 tree [4,54,55]. Cole and Ewel [45] developed allometric models for four species, Cedrela odorata,
Cordia alliodora, Hyeronima alchorneoides, and Euterpe oleracea, from data drawn from an 8 ha study site.
One of the probable reasons for this limitation could be the high cost of sampling larger populations.
Additionally, the previous two studies done to estimate above ground biomass for coast redwood were
conducted on a single plot with an area of 1.44 ha [17,18].
3.3. Scope and Limitations of Application
Since the study focused on developing a localized model, application outside the particular
ecosystem should be done with caution [51]. The stands in this study can be characterized as even-aged,
with multiple species and having a maritime inﬂuence. Furthermore, the samples collected in the
study did not include trees in clumps. Therefore, this model would not be suitable for such conditions.
Additionally, due to the huge size that certain redwood trees can reach, the use of these models should
be restricted to the given dbh range. Application outside the range may produce biased estimates.
The possible model veriﬁcation options were limited for this study due to the small sample
size [48]. However, an in-model veriﬁcation was done to check the behavior of the models by randomly
sub-classifying the observations (K-fold cross validation) and results showed a signiﬁcant difference (p
> 0.05). Future studies for estimating total above ground biomass in coastal redwood may incorporate
collecting more samples from a broader range of regions. It would also be advisable to include trees in
different stand density and height classes [50,53]. Finally, the difference in total above ground biomass
between trees regenerated from sprouts and seeds would be interesting.
4. Conclusions
Redwood is a major merchantable timber species in northwestern California. They also have a
critical role in the ecosystem. Six models were developed in this study to predict biomass components,
including TAGB, bole, bark, foliage, live and dead branches. Additionally, ﬁve allometric models were
developed for structural tree dimensions including height to live crown, height of the tree, weight and
volume of bole. The following highlights the main results from this study:
1.
Compared to the results of this study, previous generic allometric models published [5,6,12,21–25]
estimated different values for TAGB.
2.
Biomass components and tree dimensions, in general, were closely related to the dbh and were
able to account for around 90% of the variance.
3.
The study site can be characterized as a second-growth even-aged stand and the dbh range for
candidate trees used to estimate TAGB and foliage was 2.54–84.07 cm, while for all other tree
components and dimensions the range was 8.25–84.07 cm.
