RESTORING THE SUSTAINABILITY OF 
FREQUENT-FIRE FORESTS OF THE ROCKY 
MOUNTAIN WEST 
W. Wallace Covington* & Diane Vosick**  
I. 
THE CONTEMPORARY CONTEXT FOR FIRE AND FOREST 
MANAGEMENT IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN WEST1 
The ecological, social, and economic sustainability of the Rocky 
Mountain West is threatened by declining forest health that is manifested by 
unnaturally high tree densities and fuel loads, increases in invasive exotic 
plants, decreasing biological diversity (plants and animals), and increased 
insect and disease outbreaks (Box 1).2 These unnatural fuel loads lead to 
wildfires that have become unprecedented in their severity, acreage, and 
effects (Box 2).3 In this paper we discuss the causes of forest health decline 
and advocate for ecological restoration as an approach for restoring forest 
health. We also summarize recent policy changes with the stated purpose to 
accelerate restoration and provide economic validation for why restoration is 
the smartest approach for reducing the threat of catastrophic fire.

Forest Health 
As early as 1924, conservationist Aldo Leopold warned that forests in 
southern Arizona were manifesting symptoms of ill health.4 From the 1930s 
through the 1960s, other foresters, including Elers Koch (Lolo National 
Forest in Montana), Harold Weaver (Pacific Northwest and California), 
Harold Biswell (California), and Charles F. Cooper (Southwest), all noted 
increasing symptoms of ecological decline that included unnatural fire and

unprecedented disease and insect outbreaks.5 In concert with other human-
induced changes (e.g., logging, grazing, etc.), the elimination of fire’s natural 
role as the regulator of tree populations, fuel build-up, and nutrient recycling 
has created the forest health crisis confronting forests today in the Rocky 
Mountain West.6 These forests are in poor health because they are outside 
their natural range of variability and now manifest signs of comprehensive 
ecosystem decline.7 
B. 
Forest Fires 
Despite fire’s potential for destruction, surface fire is an important 
ecological process in the forests of the Rocky Mountain West.8 In fact, 
ponderosa pine forests are referred to as “frequent-fire forests” because they 
have adapted to regularly occurring surface fire during their thousands of 
years of co-evolution.9 Catastrophic wildfire (fire that burns through the 
crowns or tops of trees) is a recent phenomenon of the last twenty-five years 
in the ponderosa pine forests of the Rocky Mountain West and is one of many 
symptoms of degraded forest health.10 
Suppressing fire has been at the center of forest policy since the earliest 
days of the federal land management agencies.11 Severe fires between 1910 
and 1935 resulted in the loss of many lives and significant property damage.12

These tragedies buttressed the argument for a national fire policy focused on 
fire suppression.13 At the time, fire was viewed as a threat to natural resource 
commodities, economic development, and the ecological stability of the 
forest, not as a vital ecological process.14 By the mid-twentieth century, 
Smokey Bear became the endearing symbol of fire protection and a renowned 
education tool for protecting forests from fire.15 Smokey, and the fire fighters 
who efficiently “prevented forest fires,” reduced the risk of fire—enabling 
the issue to drop from the public and policy spotlight.16 
It could not stay that way, however. Fire suppression may have been 
viewed as eliminating big fires from the forest, but in reality aggressive 
suppression merely put them off. In the 1990s, the long-deferred “fuel bill” 
came due with a vengeance.17 Eighty years of fire suppression, continuous 
fuel build-up, and drought combined in the late 1980s and early 1990s to 
create the conditions for fires that were unprecedented in size, intensity, and 
severity for the frequent-fire forests of the Rocky Mountain West (i.e., 
ponderosa pine and other dry forest types).18 No longer a phenomenon of the 
back country, fires leapt from the forest and spread into the wildland-urban 
interface (“WUI”) where rampant population growth and residential 
development has expanded despite the fuel-laden forest at their door step.19 
In response to the shocking loss of thirty-four lives during wildfires in 
1994, the Department of Interior and Department of Agriculture developed a 
comprehensive federal fire policy.20 In 1995, diverse interests (the public, 
federal and state agencies, and other political entities) began to focus greater 
attention on solving the underlying problem of degraded forest health that 
contributed to unnatural wildfire.21 Yet, while more than one hundred years 
of scientific research supports the importance and role of natural fire,

agreeing on the management actions that are needed to reduce unnatural 
levels of fuel (such as mechanical thinning) still generate controversy.22 
These disagreements are based on concerns about the potential effects of 
thinning on aesthetics, endangered and threatened species, and old growth. 
Perhaps of greatest concern is the fear that mechanical treatments will re-
establish a logging industry with the power to drive forest management away 
from ecologically-based approaches and back to commodity-based objectives 
that dominated the 1960s–1980s. 
II. 
THE KEY ECOLOGICAL, POLICY, AND ECONOMIC ISSUES 
A. What is a Healthy Forest? 
Although there is a general consensus about what constitutes human 
health, there is much less agreement about the basis of forest health. In part, 
this lack of consensus occurs because people view forests differently. To 
some the forest is about trees, to others it’s about wildlife and their habitats, 
and to others it’s about entire landscapes. Some people look at forests as 
wildlands, some as resources to be developed and used. Opinions are diverse, 
even within these various groups. For example, resource-oriented interests 
diverge, with some viewing forests as a wood resource, while others see 
forests as a range or watershed resource.23 
In seeking a unified definition of forest health, ecologists have relied 
increasingly upon a naturalistic definition, one that states that forests are 
healthy when they exist within their natural range of species composition, 
structure and function.24 In this view, healthy forests would have their species 
composition, population dynamics, structure, and function regulated by 
natural processes (such as low-intensity surface fire).25 Unhealthy forests

would have conditions such that natural processes can no longer function in 
a sustainable manner.26 Ecologists and natural resource professionals refer to 
conditions consistent with the evolutionary environment of a particular forest 
type as within the “historic range of variability” or the “natural range of 
variability.”27 
This approach leads to a definition of forest health that varies with each 
forest type. If, under natural conditions, forest density is great and infrequent, 
stand-replacing crown fires the norm, which is often the case with lodgepole 
pine and spruce forests of the Rocky Mountain West, then dense forests that 
support crown fires would be considered healthy.28 On the other hand, 
ponderosa pine and larch forests, which are characterized under natural 
conditions by having frequent, low-intensity surface fires, would be 
considered unhealthy if they have high forest density and support crown 
fires.29 The key is that plants and animals are adapted to whatever conditions 
shaped individual ecosystems over evolutionary time, and these plants, 
animals and ecosystems may depend upon natural disturbance regimes and 
stand conditions for their very survival.30 
Using this line of thinking, today’s frequent-fire forests of the Rocky 
Mountain West—those dominated by ponderosa pine, larch, interior 
Douglas-fir, and dry mixed-conifers—are decidedly unhealthy and at risk of 
unnatural catastrophic disturbances such as crown fire and extensive insect 
and disease attack. 
B. 
Changes in Forest Health in the Rocky Mountain West 
Since Euro-American settlement in the late 1800s, overgrazing, logging, 
fire exclusion, introduction of exotic plants, insects, and diseases, and 
disruption of watersheds have led to a steady decline in forest health.31

RESTORING THE SUSTAINABILITY 
17 
Nowhere are these deleterious changes greater than in the ponderosa pine and 
dry mixed-conifer forest types of the Rocky Mountain West. Tree seedlings 
became widely established once the natural, frequent surface fires were 
eliminated from these forests by overgrazing, landscape fragmentation, and 
fire suppression.32 Repeat photography from throughout the region shows a 
tremendous increase in the number of trees, not only within stands,33 but also 
at the landscape scale.34 By the 1960s, these seedlings had grown into thickets 
of pole- and sapling-size trees and this, coupled with the steadily 
accumulating surface fuels of dead branches, twigs and conifer needles, led 
to biomass accumulations across large landscapes that fueled increasingly 
large, severe fires.35 
Fortunately, forest research had developed a solution to the problem—thin 
out excess trees, conserve old-growth trees, and use prescribed burning to 
reintroduce surface fires to regulate tree density and fuel accumulation.36 
These techniques are a foundation of ecological restoration approaches for 
restoring forest health.

What is Ecological Restoration? 
Ecological restoration is a practical approach for restoring degraded 
ecosystems—ecosystems outside their natural range of variability in terms of 
composition, structure, and function/process.38 The dictionary definition of 
“restoration” is the act of bringing back to an original or unimpaired 
condition.39 Thus, ecological restoration has as its goal the restoration of 
degraded ecosystems to more closely emulate conditions that prevailed 
before disruption of natural structures and processes, i.e. environmental 
conditions that have influenced native communities over evolutionary time.40 
Ecological restoration involves management actions designed to accelerate 
recovery of degraded ecosystems by complementing or reinforcing natural 
processes where possible, or by more active intervention when necessary.41 
Ecological restoration that restores forest health and resilience is also a useful 
strategy for maintaining forests during climate change. Properly done, it will 
improve the ability of the forest to withstand climate impacts.42 Ecological 
restoration has been viewed as ecosystem medicine where the practitioner is 
helping nature heal—that is, building upon the natural recovery processes 
inherent in the ecosystem.43

RESTORING THE SUSTAINABILITY 
21 
For frequent-fire forests of the Rocky Mountain West, ecological 
restoration involves scientifically and economically sound fuel-reduction 
treatments that treat not only wildfire symptoms, but also attack the 
underlying causes of ecosystem health decline.44 Such treatments would 
typically include thinning excess trees and reintroducing frequent, low-
intensity burning.45 Where topography is not too steep and existing roads 
allow for removal of these excess trees, opportunities may exist for using 
income from thinning to help offset restoration costs.46 Although a somewhat 
more complex undertaking, the principle would be the same for the 
restoration of forests that under natural conditions exhibited a mixture of 
frequent fire and infrequent, crown fire regimes—that is, use a combination 
of thinning and prescribed burning as needed to restore stand densities and 
landscape patterns that are consistent with the evolutionary environment of 
the organisms constituting these forests.47 Although there has been some 
discussion of the need to break up landscape-scale homogeneity for forests 
that had an infrequent, crown fire regime (e.g., most lodgepole pine and 
spruce-fir forests), it is less clear that active intervention is scientifically 
justified at this time.48 
D. 
Policy Responses to Degraded Forest Health and Wildfire 
Catastrophic fire beginning in the 1990s shocked policymakers, land 
management agencies, and communities into action.49 The response by 
elected officials was to promulgate a series of policy initiatives focused on 
the restoration of forests and reduction of hazardous fuels as the best vehicle 
to reduce the risk of unnatural fire, disease, and beetle outbreaks.50 Examples 
include the 2004 Healthy Forest Restoration Act,51 the 2009 Federal Land

Assistance, Management, and Enhancement Act (FLAME Act) and 
Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Act,52 and the 2014 U.S. Forest 
Service regulation that creates a new pre-decisional National Environmental 
Policy Act (NEPA) objection process that is designed to resolve objections 
before a final Record of Decision is signed for a proposed project.53  
There are several recurring themes throughout these policies that reflect a 
new approach to federal land management decision-making. These include: 
efforts to streamline the environmental review and appeal process; a call for 
incorporating the best available science into treatment design; encouraging 
the use of collaborative processes to guide land management action; a 
proposal to revamp how fires are paid for by the federal government; and 
urging 
cross-jurisdictional 
coordination 
to 
maximize 
efficiency, 
communication, and involvement.54 A core motivation of the new approach 
has been to actively engage stakeholders early in the decision process to 
reduce potential conflict and gridlock that characterized forest management 
during the 1990s.55 The Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HFRA) and Healthy 
Forests Initiative (HFI) strive to streamline environmental review 
processes,56 NEPA57 and other pieces of legislation passed during the 1960s 
and 1970s. These earlier laws and policies were developed in response to 
public demand for greater accountability, public involvement, and 
transparency in land management decisions.58 Whether or not the early 
environmental legislation has facilitated or hindered good land management 
is a source of heated debate.59 What is certain is that litigation or threats

thereof, contributed to a decline in timber sales and timber harvest beginning 
in the 1990s.60 Insecurity surrounding litigation combined with a changing 
investment climate for the wood products industry and adjustments in the 
international wood market, caused a decline in timber-related activity during 
the 1990s in the Rocky Mountain West.61 As a result, there were fewer forest-
related jobs, a loss of the private workforce, and a near elimination of the 
harvest infrastructure throughout much of the rural West.62 The 1990s also 
saw a change in management focus from profitable commercial logging of 
large trees to the need to remove low or no value, small-diameter trees in

Federal Appropriations and the Cost of Fire Suppression 
Over the last twenty years the cost of fire suppression has skyrocketed.64 
Unlike other federal agencies that are not required to budget for potential 
disasters, the U.S. Forest Service is required to fund fire suppression entirely 
within their annual appropriation (along with all their other management 
responsibilities).65 The ability to accurately predict and fund fire suppression 
and all the other management responsibilities of the U.S. Forest Service 
changed with the fire season of 2000.66 According to the GAO, “[t]he scale 
and intensity of the fires [of 2000] capped a decade that was characterized by 
dramatic increases not only in the number of severe wildland fires, but also 
in the costs associated with suppressing them.”67 In 2000, the cost of the 
wildfire season exceeded the U.S. Forest Service fire suppression budget 
necessitating the need for emergency supplemental appropriations.68  
Unfortunately, as fire suppression costs have increased an ever-growing 
percentage of the U.S. Forest Service budget is consumed by wildland fire 
management.69 Wildland fire suppression funding is based on a ten-year 
rolling average calculated backward over the previous ten years.70 That 
approach worked when fire suppression was predictable and stable. However, 
given the continuing build-up of fuels, changing climatic conditions that 
result in longer, drier and more severe fire seasons, and more people living 
in the WUI, suppression activities are more complex and more expensive than 
in the past.71 Equally insidious is that the U.S. Forest Service has had to 
“borrow money” from itself to cover suppression costs resulting in the 
disruption of other management activities.72 In 2009 Congress passed the 
FLAME Act73 to create a more sustainable funding mechanism in order to 
stop fire borrowing;74 however, the act has not been effective, and as a result

[Ariz. St. L.J. 
numerous bills have been introduced in Congress over the last three years in 
order to create a better fix.75  
In 2015, the U.S. Forest Service expects more than fifty percent of its 
annual budget to go toward suppression of wildfire and related activities.76 
According to the U.S. Forest Service report, The Rising Cost of Wildfire 
Operations: Effects on the Forest Service’s Non-Fire Work presented to 
Congress in 2015:  
Funding for non-fire programs has not kept pace with the increased 
cost of fighting fire. The growth in fire suppression costs has 
steadily consumed an ever-increasing portion of the agency’s 
appropriated budget . . . requiring the agency to forego opportunities 
to complete vital restoration work and meet public expectations for 
services. Those non-fire activities are often those that improve the 
health and resilience of our forested landscapes and mitigate the 
potential for wildland fire in future years.77  
Ironically, as the cost of fire suppression spiraled upward, the Office of 
Management and Budget chose in Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 to cut hazardous 
fuels reduction dollars and focus its attention on fire “cost containment.”78 
For years prior to 2014 the OMB and GAO asked the federal land 
management agencies to demonstrate when and how federal investments in 
hazardous fuels treatments would result in a reduction in federal suppression 
costs. Congress reacted by holding hearings in the summer of 2013 to 
determine if hazardous fuels treatments were effective in reducing both 
ecological and economic impacts of fire.79 That summer the Ecological 
Restoration Institute presented a report addressing OMB’s concerns. It 
demonstrated the efficacy of forest thinning and restoration for changing fire 
behavior, protecting property and avoiding costs associated with catastrophic 
fire and its aftermath.80  
The enduring solution to solving the catastrophic fire crisis is to increase 
federal investment in restoration treatments and hazardous fuels reduction

activities that prevent unnatural fire by restoring forests. Metaphorically 
speaking, our current strategy is focused on cutting services in the emergency 
room rather than investing in keeping the patient well. This strategy may 
work in the short-term, but ultimately we are likely to lose the “patient.” 
III. 
THE ECONOMIC, ECOLOGIC, AND SOCIETAL VALUE OF A HEALTHY 
FOREST 
Conserving forests, and the breadth of environmental services they 
provide, was a founding motivation for establishing the system of federal 
forest reserves 100 years ago.81 However, as society changed, so did the focus 
of the U.S. Forest Service. For example, rapid economic expansion following 
World War II led the U.S. Forest Service to increase national timber 
production to provide wood for a booming home-building industry.82 As 
timber production became the central focus of the U.S. Forest Service, 
managing for other forest-derived services became less important for the 
public and for policymakers.83 However, in the 1950s and 1960s, outdoor 
recreation and other uses of forests intensified as people found they had more 
leisure time.84 In response, Congress passed the Multiple Use-Sustained Yield 
Act of 1960.85 It authorized and directed the Secretary of Agriculture to 
develop and administer the renewable resources of national forests, including 
outdoor recreation, watersheds, wildlife, and other values in such a way that 
they would be available in perpetuity.86 It clarified that no single use should 
take precedence over another.87 Nevertheless, it wasn’t until timber 
production declined in the 1990s that the U.S. Forest Service began to 
redefine its mission to reflect current societal preferences.  
Over the last ten years the leadership of the U.S. Forest Service has 
reasserted the importance of healthy forests not because they produce timber, 
but rather for the wealth of environmental services they provide and for their 
associated economic and social benefits.88 This renewed focus on

environmental services generated creative thinking about some of the 
contemporary outputs that can be derived and economically valued from 
forests, such as carbon sequestration credits for reforestation89 and water.90 In 
Arizona, when full-cost accounting considers the diverse constellation of 
benefits derived from forests, the economic value of a forest far exceeds the 
value of its saw timber.91  
We have much to gain from restoring forests and more to lose if we do 
not. The most immediate value of a restored forest is the avoidance of the 
costs and effects of catastrophic fire.92 A restored forest will provide 
improved environmental services, jobs during and following restoration, and 
woody biomass fuel that can be used to offset our energy dependence on oil.93 
A. Losses Avoided 
There are numerous costs associated with large fires that are far greater 
than just the cost of suppression.94 Direct costs include loss of timber, loss of 
property, and the cost of post-fire rehabilitation.95 Indirect costs include lost 
wages, mental health issues, and loss of habitat for endangered and threatened 
species and are much more difficult to quantify.96 The loss of firefighter 
and/or civilian lives, such as the devastating loss of nineteen firefighters at 
the Yarnell Hill fire in 2013, defy any meaningful monetary measurement.97 
A 2003 study determined that the direct cost associated with the 42,875-acre 
Cerro Grande fire was approximately $1.2 billion, of which only $33.5 
million (2.8%) could be attributed to fire suppression costs.98 The principal

impacts of the fire were damage to private property and homes, the Los 
Alamos National Laboratory, archeological and cultural sites, and 
watersheds.99 A more recent study of the full costs of the 2010 Schultz fire 
and post-fire flood in Flagstaff, Arizona used surveys, assessor’s records, and 
interviews to calculate the full cost of that disaster to be between $133 and 
$147 million.100 One cost-avoidance analysis concluded that it is 
economically irrational not to reduce hazardous fuels.101 The authors of the 
analysis argue that the amount that could be invested in treatments to avoid 
future costs justifies spending $238–$601 per acre for hazardous fuel 
reduction treatments in the Southwest.102 An accounting of costs associated 
with the 469,000-acre Rodeo-Chediski fire of 2002 demonstrates the 
potential magnitude of some indirect costs.103 For example, short-term job 
losses in Navajo and Apache counties and associated lost wages were 
estimated to be $6.1 million; the mental health needs of those residents living 
in evacuation shelters were likewise great, requiring more than 4,883 therapy 
sessions with mental health volunteers and professionals.104 In addition, more 
than 3,500 acres of critical endangered species habitat for Mexican spotted 
owl were lost.105

Environmental Services 
In the last twenty years, the economic value of extractive products from 
forests—minerals, timber, and forage for livestock—have lost economic 
clout to the value of current and potential environmental services provided 
by a healthy forest.106 These valuable resources include functioning 
watersheds and groundwater recharge, wildlife and wildlife habitat, aesthetic 
and spiritual amenities, and carbon storage, to name only a few.107 Relying 
on these resources are the cities and agricultural production of the West, 
recreation-based rural economies, and highly stressed, amenity-seeking 
urbanites who go to the woods for renewal.108 
It is difficult to place a monetary value on the water produced by national 
forests. A 2010 review of the literature stated that the national forests produce 
87 trillion gallons of water per year that supplies more than 60 million 
people.109 Calculating the exact value of the water is difficult because the 
value of water has both market and nonmarket values.110 Nevertheless, 
attempts have been made using a variety of approaches. The paper cites one 
study that conservatively estimates the value at $3.7 billion per year while 
admitting that some benefits couldn’t be calculated.111  
Another study surveyed more than 600 people to determine their 
willingness to pay for protecting habitat for the endangered Mexican spotted 
owl.112 They found that the range of estimated value of those surveyed when 
extrapolated for the entire country was from $1.8 to $2.6 billion.113 This figure 
was significantly larger than cost estimates for implementing the species 
recovery plan and demonstrates the importance of wildlife and wildlife 
habitat to the public.114

Jobs and Business 
According to testimony provided by U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom 
Tidwell, in FY 2011, activities on the national forests contributed more than 
$36 billion to America’s gross domestic product and supported nearly 
450,000 jobs.115 
Forest restoration provides the opportunity to create jobs in the harvest 
and manufacturing sector that pay competitive wages.116 Although tourism 
contributes significantly to the economies of the Rocky Mountain West, it is 
an employment sector that relies heavily on an unskilled, low-paid work 
force.117 As forest restoration activities ramp up to reduce hazardous fuels, 
many hope there will be new opportunities for creating a restoration-based 
economy. One vision for restoration-based, private sector businesses is that 
they will be diverse and appropriately scaled to the amount of wood by-
products generated by restoration.118 This model seeks to avoid the problems 
created by previous boom-and-bust economic cycles that led to political 
pressure on forest managers to generate wood for the sake of industry at levels 
inconsistent with sustainable forest management.119 
Private sector investment in businesses using small wood has been weak 
during the last fifteen years because investors lack confidence in business 
plans that depend on wood supply from federal lands.120 To address this 
problem, Congress, in 1998, created a new contracting tool for the U.S. Forest 
Service.121 Commonly referred to as “stewardship contracting,”122 this 
instrument has proven to be very useful for achieving restoration goals and 
helping rural communities.123 Stewardship contracting enables agency 
decision makers to award contracts on the basis of “best value contracting,” 
which allows price and non-price criteria to be considered in the bid, 
multiple-year wood supply guarantees, and the ability to mix and match 
payment for services in combination with timber sales.124

RESTORING THE SUSTAINABILITY 
33 
The White Mountain Stewardship Contract (WMSC) in eastern Arizona 
illustrates the potential for the growth of private sector business and job 
creation when a guaranteed wood supply is made available.125 Begun in 2004 
and completed in 2014 the WMSC treated almost 70,000 acres over ten years 
and stimulated the creation of twenty diverse businesses in the wood harvest 
and manufacturing sector during the first five years.126  
CONCLUSION 
The consensus among natural resource professionals and ecologists is that 
disruption of natural fire regimes, dramatic increases in tree populations, and 
spreading landscape homogeneity are the greatest single threat to biological 
diversity and ecosystem sustainability in the Rocky Mountain West, and that 
actions must be taken to reverse ongoing ecosystem degradation. Without 
such coordinated action at the landscape scale, the prospects look grim for 
the quality of life—not only for the forest and woodland ecosystems of the 
Rocky Mountain West, but for the human populations that rely on these 
resources. 
Forest restoration provides important monetary and non-monetary values 
that improve prospects for community and forest health. We can clearly 
demonstrate that it is economically smart and practical to invest federal 
funding in treatments that will reduce the risk of fire and avoid the need to 
suppress them. Forest restoration has the potential to stimulate new markets 
for wood products and produce energy that simultaneously will create new 
business opportunities and good paying jobs. In addition, the environmental 
services provided by forests, although difficult to fully quantify, are essential 
for future economic development and societal well-being. 
Fortunately, the public is aware of the problems associated with degraded 
forest health and support region-wide ecological treatments designed to 
restore the regions’ forests. Controversy can be minimized and progress made 
by identifying the areas of broad agreement for restoration action through 
collaboration among diverse stakeholders. After many years of confounded 
land management, we are testing a more inclusive approach to forest 
management. Fortunately, this new paradigm is advancing the actions needed 
to restore the forests of the Rocky Mountain West.
