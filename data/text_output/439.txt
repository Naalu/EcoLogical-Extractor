Landscape-Scale Forest Habitat Relationships
to Tassel-Eared Squirrel Populations: Implications
for Ponderosa Pine Forest Restoration
Norris L. Dodd,1,2 Raymond E. Schweinsburg,1 and Susan Boe1
Abstract
Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa pine) forest ecosystem resto-
ration is a growing emphasis in the southwestern United
States to address over 120 years of forest structure change,
decreased forest health, and increased potential for disease
and
wildﬁre.
Restoration
treatments
replicating
pre-
settlement conditions may reduce tree density by 98%, are
detrimental to canopy-dependent wildlife such as tassel-
eared squirrel (Sciurus aberti), particularly at the patch
scale, and are of concern when applied at the landscape
scale. We examined S. aberti population dynamics in
north-central Arizona, U.S.A., from 1999 to 2002 at nine
280-ha sites oriented along a landscape gradient of varying
proportions (4.6–99.2%) of unlogged, high-quality (HQ)
habitats within a matrix of intensively thinned low-quality
habitat. Our objectives were to estimate S. aberti density,
juvenile recruitment, and survival across this gradient;
quantify patch- and landscape-scale habitat relationships to
populations; evaluate possible habitat thresholds in squirrel
population response; and develop forest management
recommendations. In regression models, both patch-scale
and landscape-scale parameters inﬂuenced squirrel popula-
tions. At the patch scale, number of interlocking canopy
trees was added most frequently, whereas the proportion of
HQ habitat was the landscape-scale variable added in ﬁve
of seven models. Recruitment and survival at dense, HQ
plots were inversely related to number of small, sapling-
sized trees. Nonlinear thresholds in density and recruitment
occurred when the proportion of HQ habitat at study sites
was between 24 and 42%. Our study points to the impor-
tance of maintaining HQ habitat in mesoreserves on the
landscape at or above this threshold range, as well as purs-
ing a mix of forest management prescriptions in the matrix
surrounding mesoreserves to achieve wildlife, forest resto-
ration, and ﬁre risk reduction objectives.

Introduction
Since European settlement of the southwestern United
States, timber harvest, ﬁre suppression, and livestock grazing
have contributed to substantial changes in Pinus ponderosa
(ponderosa pine) forest structure. Pre-settlement (circa 1870)
forests consisted of older trees and were more open (Cooper
1960; Covington & Moore 1994; Belsky & Blumenthal 1997).
Today, younger trees dominate forests (Johnson 1994; Mast
et al. 1999), often exceeding 3,000 stems/ha (Covington et al.
1997; Mast 2003). These conditions present increased poten-
tial for catastrophic wildﬁre, disease, and decreased ecosys-
tem health (Covington & Moore 1994; Covington et al. 1997)
and have spawned restoration initiatives (Moore et al. 1999),
advocating aggressive thinning and prescribed ﬁre to pro-
mote forest and ecosystem health (Covington & Moore
1994; Covington et al. 1997).
Though widespread agreement exists as to the need for
forest restoration, similar agreement does not exist on res-
toration methodologies, particularly with regard to restor-
ing forest processes and natural ranges of variability
(Allen et al. 2002). The prevailing emphasis is on recon-
struction of pre-settlement reference forest density struc-
ture (Covington et al. 1997; Fule´ et al. 1997; Mast et al.
1999), which has resulted in large reductions in tree den-
sity, up to 98%, leaving 60 trees/ha or less (Mast et al.
1999). Such treatments may adversely affect many wildlife
species (Wagner et al. 2000; Allen et al. 2002; Chambers
& Germaine 2003), though few studies have speciﬁcally
addressed potential impacts. Pre-settlement prescriptions
may reduce short- and long-term patch-scale canopy clo-
sure, tree density, diversity, and patchiness important to
canopy-dependent wildlife (Chambers & Germaine 2003;
Dodd et al. 2003). Because restoration activities are pur-
sued at the landscape scale, the combined inﬂuence of
patch- and landscape-scale habitat alteration on wildlife is
of increasing interest and concern and may affect millions
of hectares (Allen et al. 2002; Zimmerman 2003).
Tassel-eared squirrel (Sciurus aberti) is an obligate spe-
cies of P. ponderosa forests in the southwestern United
States. It is considered an indicator species for P. ponderosa
forest structure and canopy-dependent wildlife (Chambers

& Germaine 2003; Prather et al. 2006) and important prey
for Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis; Reynolds et al.
1992). Squirrels play a key role in symbiotic interactions
of mycorrhizal fungi with P. ponderosa, consuming fruit-
ing bodies and dispersing spores (States & Gaud 1997;
States & Wettstein 1998). Tree squirrels are well suited
for research as they are sufﬁciently abundant to yield sta-
tistically meaningful population data and sensitive enough
to structural habitat condition changes to allow for forest
management inferences (Carey 2000).
Past even-aged treatments, structurally similar to resto-
ration prescriptions to achieve pre-settlement reference
conditions (Mast et al. 1999; Mast 2003), have reduced for-
est canopy closure, interlocking canopy trees, mature tree
density, and patchiness and are detrimental to S. aberti
populations at the patch scale (Pederson et al. 1976, 1987;
Patton 1984; Patton et al. 1985; Dodd et al. 2003), with
largely unknown impact at the landscape scale. Intensive
thinning alters fungi microhabitats, reduces fungi produc-
tion (States & Gaud 1997), and potentially disrupts symbi-
otic
relationships
among
fungi,
pines,
and
squirrels
(Pederson et al. 1987; States et al. 1988; States & Gaud
1997). Fungi constitute an important seasonal food for
S. aberti (Stephenson 1975; States et al. 1988) and strongly
inﬂuence juvenile recruitment (Dodd et al. 2003).
Forest restoration treatments applied over large areas
could have signiﬁcant consequences for S. aberti. Resto-
ration may add to cumulative impact from past even-
aged management, including already reduced stand,
patch, and landscape diversity (Patton 1992). Extensive
forest restoration may diminish remaining high-quality
(HQ) squirrel habitat (Patton 1984), potentially reducing
suitable habitat below threshold levels, with deleterious
effects on populations (Andren 1994; Andren & Delin
1994; With & Crist 1995). Conversely, squirrels may ben-
eﬁt from creation of a landscape-scale mosaic of struc-
tural habitat conditions and patch sizes (Patton 1975a,
1992; Lema 2001; Dodd et al. 2003).
Compared to our understanding of patch-scale habitat
relationships, we have a limited understanding of relation-
ships of landscape-scale habitat composition to squirrel
populations. For this reason, coupled with the escalating
emphasis on forest restoration that will increasingly affect
forest landscapes, we initiated a research project with the
following objectives.
(1) Estimate S. aberti density, juvenile recruitment, and
survival across a gradient of landscape-scale forest
habitat conditions.
(2) Quantify patch- and landscape-scale habitat structure
and composition and evaluate relationships to squirrel
populations.
(3) Evaluate the possible presence of thresholds in squir-
rel population response along landscape composition
gradients.
(4) Develop recommendations for landscape-scale forest
habitat management considering needs of S. aberti.
Rationale for Landscape Approach
A number of studies have suggested that there may be
important thresholds associated with reductions in suit-
able habitat (typically around 30% suitable habitat),
where effects of patch area and isolation accelerate and
strengthen the effect of habitat loss (Andren 1994; Andren
& Delin 1994; Karieva & Wennergren 1995; Bowers &
Matter 1997). These ﬁndings led us to assess relationships
of S. aberti populations to the proportion of suitable habi-
tat in the landscape.
We oriented our study sites along a gradient of varying
proportions of unlogged, HQ habitat within a mosaic of
intensively managed relatively low-quality (LQ) habitat.
HQ squirrel habitat exhibited characteristics of source
habitats (Pulliam 1988); such habitats exhibited stable
density and consistent juvenile recruitment (Dodd et al.
1998, 2003). Conversely, intensively thinned LQ habitats
displayed characteristics of sink habitats (Pulliam 1988),
with large seasonal ﬂuctuations in nonresident squirrel
density and poor recruitment (Dodd et al. 1998, 2003).
Study Areas
From 1999 to 2002, we conducted our study at nine sites in
north-central Arizona, U.S.A., all located on the Coconino
National
Forest
(lat
34309–35309N,
long
111159–
111459W). All sites were within the P. ponderosa associa-
tion of the montane coniferous forest community (Brown
1994), between 2,050- and 2,400-m elevation. Study sites
were oriented along a gradient of landscapes composed of
varying proportions of homogeneous patches of unlogged
HQ and thinned LQ habitats (Fig.1). HQ habitats had mul-
tiple age classes with a well-deﬁned large tree component
(501 trees/ha >45-cm diameter at breast height [dbh]), with
high basal area (BA; >35 m2/ha) and canopy closure
(>50%), and exhibited interlocking canopies (Dodd et al.
2003). LQ habitats had relatively few large trees (<20 trees/
ha) and lower BA (<18 m2/ha) and canopy closure (<30%)
(Dodd et al. 2003). HQ habitats were patchy, with uneven-
aged structure and mature forest characteristics reﬂecting
no logging or light individual tree selection. LQ patches
had intensive shelterwood harvest (Schubert 1974) more
than 10 years prior to study and were predominately even
aged. The proportion of HQ habitat within our sites,
expressed as a percentage, ranged from 4.6 to 99.2%
(Fig.1); most sites (six) had a proportion of HQ habitat
near or below 50% to facilitate potential threshold assess-
ment in squirrel population response.
Drought conditions prevailed during our study, with
precipitation
below
average
during
all
four
years
(National Weather Service, Bellemont, Arizona, U.S.A.).
Drought conditions were most apparent for November–
May. For this period, 2001–2002 was the driest year on
record (23.4% of normal). Snowfall accumulation, the pri-
mary factor limiting winter S. aberti survival (Stephenson
& Brown 1980), varied among years, ranging from 91.9 cm
in 2001–2002 to 298.4 cm in 2000–2001.

Methods
Study Site Selection
A Geographic Information System (GIS) supervised
classiﬁcation using spectral signatures from LANDSAT
imagery
and
IMAGINE
remote-sensing
software
(ERDAS 1994) was used to identify 280-ha core study
sites. Core sites were buffered by adjacent consistent
habitat (<10% difference in proportion of HQ habitat)
to encompass 500 ha to avoid edge effects (McGarigal &
Marks 1995; Fig. 1). The 280-ha size was considered ade-
quate to investigate landscape relationships for S. aberti,
and exceeded 125-ha sites used by Swihart and Nupp
(1998) for four species of tree squirrels. Aerial photo-
graphy and ground validation aided in selection of sites.
Target minimum patch size within study sites was 31 ha.
Population Dynamics
We estimated S. aberti density, juvenile recruitment, and
survival at each site. Separate estimates for each were
derived for HQ and LQ habitat sampling plots.
Figure 1. Landscape-scale composition of nine study sites located in north-central Arizona, U.S.A., at which Sciurus aberti population dynamics
were assessed during 1999–2002. The study sites were oriented along a gradient of varying proportions of HQ habitat, expressed as percentages.
The boxes correspond to the 280-ha core study sites in which all population, vegetation, and landscape assessments were conducted, with an outer
buffer of adjacent similar landscape composition, bringing the total area to 500 ha. Dots denote sampling plots where both density and recruitment
were estimated, and squares denote plots where density only was estimated.

Density.
Depending on the proportion of HQ habitat
within a study site, we located two to four density sam-
pling plots 24 ha in size in LQ (n ¼ 13 plots) and HQ (n ¼
12 plots) habitats, proportional to the area of each habitat
class (Fig. 1). We estimated squirrel density using the feed-
ing sign index technique developed by Dodd et al. (1998).
This index provides for efﬁcient and reliable estimation of
squirrel density, which otherwise would be impractical
with costly capture–recapture techniques (Pollock et al.
1990; Dodd et al. 2003; Prather et al. 2006).
We assessed the presence of feeding sign (Rasmussen
et al. 1975; Dodd et al. 1998) that accumulated during late
winter and spring on 256-m2 plots located 17.5 m apart on
eight parallel transects, with each transect 70 m apart (32
plots/transect). Feeding sign counts were conducted in late
April and May each year. We arcsine transformed per-
centage frequency of occurrence of feeding sign on sam-
pling plots and entered data into a regression model to
derive squirrel density estimates and 90% prediction
intervals (Dodd et al. 1998).
Recruitment.
We estimated juvenile recruitment at two
of the sampling plots used to estimate density at each
study site (n ¼ 8 LQ and 10 HQ plots; Fig. 1); not all plots
were sampled due to limitations of traps and labor. We
established 8 3 8 trapping grids (n ¼ 64 trap stations) with
70-m spacing at each sampling plot. We used live traps
(Tomahawk No. 202, Tomahawk Live Trap Co., Toma-
hawk, WI, U.S.A.) baited with unshelled peanuts (Patton
et al. 1976). Captured squirrels were immobilized and
marked with numbered ear tags, similar to that in the
study by Dodd et al. (2003). We visually determined sex
and weighed each squirrel. We assumed that squirrels
were juveniles if body mass was less than 550 g (Keith
1965; Farentinos 1972; Dodd et al. 2003).
We trapped ﬁve consecutive days at each sampling plot,
with all 18 plots trapped over 12 days in mid-late October.
Emergence of juveniles from maternal nests generally
occurs in late August (Brown 1984), though juveniles
proved difﬁcult to trap until mid-October (Sieg 2002). We
expressed recruitment as juveniles per hectare, using
a buffered effective trapping area of 31 ha. This measure
better reﬂected variation in recruitment among plots than
juveniles/adult female (Brown 1984), though mean annual
recruitment for all sites was presented as such.
Survival Rates.
To estimate squirrel survival between
trapping periods, we used the ‘‘robust design’’ (Pollock
1982). It combined pooled closed-population capture–
recapture histories and the open-population Jolly–Seber
model. Survival rates and SE were derived for two intervals
between trapping efforts (1999–2000 and 2000–2001) using
the program JOLLY (Jolly 1965; Pollock et al. 1990).
Habitat Assessment
Landscape Analysis.
All LQ and HQ habitat, as well as
nonhabitat (e.g., meadows), patches were delineated on
LANDSAT imagery and aerial photographs, digitized,
and entered onto GIS. We used FRAGSTATS spatial
analysis software (McGarigal & Marks 1995) to quantify
landscape structure and composition. Landscape variables
were computed at both class (LQ and HQ habitat) and
landscape scales. We computed eight class-scale and 18
landscape-scale variables with FRAGSTATS for our 280-
ha study site cores (McGarigal & Marks 1995).
Patch Structural Habitat Measurements.
We measured
habitat characteristics that inﬂuence S. aberti populations
(Ratcliff et al. 1975; Pederson et al. 1976, 1987; Patton
1984; Dodd et al. 2003). At each recruitment sampling
plot, we randomly selected 12 trapping stations. A 0.10-ha
circular plot was located in a random direction and
distance within 35 m from the trapping station point.
Within each plot, we measured dbh for P. ponderosa over
2.5-cm dbh.
We estimated canopy cover using a staff-mounted, self-
leveling sighting periscope (Ganey & Block 1994), record-
ing periscope cross-hair interceptions with canopy foliage
over 2-m height at 100 points associated with each of the
12 plots (Dodd et al. 2003). We measured relative inci-
dence of trees with ‘‘interlocking’’ canopy crowns within
1.5 m of each other, the distance we observed squirrels
jumping from tree to tree (Dodd et al. 2003). We calcu-
lated BA and tree density for all trees above 2.5-cm dbh
and corresponding to four vegetation structural stages
(VSS 2–5; Reynolds et al. 1992; Dodd et al. 2003) from
tree measurements for each of the 12 plots and averaged
for study sites.
Statistical Analysis
We performed all statistical tests using program STATIS-
TICA (Statsoft, Inc. 1994). All mean values are reported
as ±SE. We used p  0.05 to identify signiﬁcant relation-
ships in all tests and procedures.
Population Dynamics.
We used analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) to assess differences in mean squirrel den-
sity, recruitment, and survival rates between LQ and HQ
plots and among years, controlling for study site effects
(Hays 1981). For signiﬁcant ANCOVAs, we assessed pair-
wise differences with Sheffe´ multiple comparison tests
(Hays 1981).
Population and Habitat Relationships.
We used forward
stepwise multiple regression (Neter et al. 1996) as an
exploratory means to assess relationships among mean
S. aberti population variables and habitat attributes at
patch and landscape scales (Table 1). We applied arcsine
transformations to all variables expressed as decimal frac-
tions or percentages before analysis. We conducted sepa-
rate analyses for LQ and HQ habitat sampling plots, as
well as for all sampling plots combined.

We limited the number of independent variables in our
multiple regression models to two, given that there were
only nine cases (Tabachnick & Fidell 1989). Otherwise, we
imposed no other criterion for independent variable selec-
tion in our regression models. We assessed the relative
importance of independent variables in the models both by
partial regression analysis comparing partial regression
coefﬁcients and by simple regression comparing individual
correlation coefﬁcients for each variable. We used correla-
tion analysis to identify potential multicollinearity among
variables incorporated into regression models, both patch-
or landscape-scale variables, and tests of residuals to
address regression assumptions (Neter et al. 1996).
Population Response Thresholds.
We evaluated existence
of thresholds in squirrel population response (density,
recruitment, and survival on HQ, LQ, and all sample plots
combined) along the gradient of proportion of HQ habitat
in the landscape using piecewise linear regression (Neter et
al. 1996). This technique examines whether a relationship
between two variables is best described as a simple linear
response or as two separate linear responses on either side
of some breakpoint. With this technique, linear regression
lines were broken into two separate regression lines at
a breakpoint, as either continuous or discontinuous lines.
We applied a lack-of-ﬁt F-test to assess whether the
piecewise model provided a better ﬁt than linear models
to the relationships between population response and the
proportion of HQ habitat (R. St. Laurent 2002, Northern
Arizona University, personal communication). This test
compared the loss functions for each technique, using
residual sums of squares for the loss function for the linear
regression technique, which had two parameters (slope
and intercept). For the piecewise technique, the loss func-
tion was computed by program STATISTICA; models
derived from this technique had ﬁve parameters (two sets
of slopes and intercepts and a breakpoint).
Where piecewise models provided a better ﬁt over lin-
ear regression models, we evaluated where the indepen-
dent variable (proportion of HQ habitat) breakpoint
occurred by comparing loss functions associated with each
HQ habitat interval between study sites. Breakpoints
(ﬃthresholds) occurred where the loss function for inter-
vals was minimized.

Population Dynamics
Density.
We counted feeding sign on 6,400 1-m2 plots
annually to estimate squirrel density. Mean HQ plot den-
sity (0.42 ± 0.02 squirrels/ha) was 2.5 times higher than
mean LQ plot density (0.16 ± 0.01 squirrels/ha; F[1,15] ¼
75.0, p < 0.001). Mean HQ plot density did not differ
among study sites, whereas LQ plot density did (F[6,28] ¼
6.03, p < 0.001). Highest mean LQ plot density occurred
on study sites with intermediate (42–52%) proportions of
HQ habitat.
Mean LQ plot density did not differ among years, rang-
ing from 0.11 (±0.03) in 2002 to 0.20 (±0.03) squirrels/ha
in 2001. Conversely, mean HQ plot density differed
among years (F[3,27] ¼ 9.1, p < 0.001); mean density in
2002 (0.29 ± 0.02 squirrels/ha) was less than for the other
three years (p ¼ 0.001 to 0.005), which ranged from 0.45
(±0.03) to 0.48 (±0.04) squirrels/ha. Between 2001 and
2002 alone, mean HQ plot density declined 39.5%.
Recruitment.
We captured 696 different squirrels during
23,040 trap days, including 510 adults (243 female squirrels
[49.1%], 252 male squirrels [50.9%], and 15 unidentiﬁed)
and 186 juveniles (87 female squirrels [47.5%], 96 males
squirrels [52.4%], and 3 unidentiﬁed). An average of 7.6
different adults were captured each year on LQ plots com-
pared with 13.9 on HQ plots, and an average of nearly

four times as many juveniles were trapped on HQ (3.8) as
on LQ (1.0) habitat plots.
HQ plot recruitment averaged 0.12 juveniles/ha (±0.02)
and was greater (F[1,15] ¼ 8.09, p ¼ 0.012) than recruit-
ment on LQ plots (0.03 ± 0.01 juveniles/ha). Excluding
two years with limited recruitment, HQ plot recruitment
differed among study sites (F[7,8] ¼ 4.69, p ¼ 0.022) but
not among LQ plots. Mean recruitment varied among
years. Mean HQ plot recruitment varied the most (F[3,27]
¼ 16.1, p < 0.001), with recruitment in 1999 (0.22 ± 0.03
juveniles/ha) and 2001(0.21 ± 0.04) greater than in 2000
(0.01 ± <0.01 juveniles/ha) and 2002 (0.02 ± 0.01 juveniles/
ha) (all p < 0.001). Mean LQ plot recruitment also dif-
fered, though not to the degree of HQ plots (F[3,22] ¼ 4.1,
p ¼ 0.019), with peak recruitment in 2001 (0.09 ± 0.03
juveniles/ha) greater than in 2002, when we caught no
juveniles (p ¼ 0.042).
For all plots combined, annual mean recruitment
ranged from 0.05 juveniles/adult female in 2000 to 1.92
juveniles/adult female in 2001.
Survival.
Mean squirrel survival rates averaged 0.47
(±0.07) on LQ plots and 0.53 (±0.16) on HQ plots, which
were not different. Squirrel survival on LQ plots did not
differ between periods, averaging 0.42 (±0.20) in 1999–
2000 and 0.50 (±0.27) in 2000–2001. Survival did differ
between periods on HQ plots (F[1,17] ¼ 10.08, p ¼ 0.005),
dropping from 0.64 (±0.15) in 1999–2000 to 0.41 (±0.14) in
2000–2001.
Population and Habitat Relationships
Stepwise multiple regression yielded signiﬁcant relation-
ships among S. aberti population and patch- and land-
scape-scale
habitat
variables
for
all
sampling
plot
analyses, with the exception of survival for LQ and com-
bined plots (Table 1). In all seven signiﬁcant models,
patch-scale structural habitat condition and landscape-
scale variables were both added, underscoring their joint
inﬂuence on S. aberti populations. In most instances,
patch-scale structural habitat parameters had both larger
partial regression coefﬁcients and individual correlation
coefﬁcients, indicating greater inﬂuence in the models
(Table 1). With 26 total landscape variables available for
regression analysis, the proportion of HQ habitat was the
landscape-scale variable incorporated in ﬁve of seven sig-
niﬁcant models (Table 1). None of the variables in regres-
sion models were intercorrelated, and residual analyses
indicated that assumptions were satisﬁed for all regression
models.
In the model describing the relationship of mean squir-
rel density on HQ plots, density was inﬂuenced to a greater
degree by number of interlocking trees per point than by
proportion of HQ habitat (Table 1). On LQ plots, mean
density was inversely related to mean nearest neighbor
distance to HQ patches, as well as to mean canopy closure
(Table 1). Mean juvenile recruitment on HQ plots was
inversely related to number of small, sapling-sized trees
and secondarily to landscape edge density (Table 1). Num-
ber of interlocking canopy trees inﬂuenced recruitment on
LQ sampling plots to a greater degree than proportion of
HQ habitat, also incorporated into the derived model
(Table 1).
Like HQ plot recruitment, HQ plot survival was
inversely related to the number of sapling trees per hect-

Population Response Thresholds
Of the nine comparisons between linear and piecewise lin-
ear regression techniques for S. aberti population parame-
ters and proportion of HQ habitat, piecewise linear
relationships constituted a better ﬁt for three models
(Table 2; Fig. 2). For the only two multiple regression
models to which proportion of HQ habitat was not added
(Table 1), nonlinear thresholds in population response to

Separate models were derived for HQ, LQ, and all sampling plots combined. Lack-of-ﬁt F-tests were used to determine if piecewise linear regression models consti-
tuted a better ﬁt than linear models to the relationships between population response and the proportion of HQ habitat; signiﬁcant tests are in bold, with breakpoint

the proportion of HQ habitat were identiﬁed for both.
The discontinuous piecewise linear regression relationship
between mean LQ plot density and proportion of HQ
habitat (Table 2; Fig. 2) explained 57% more variation (98
vs. 41%) over the linear relationship and provided a better
ﬁt (F[3,2] ¼ 22.42). The piecewise relationship explained
65% more variation (98 vs. 33%) over the linear relation-
ship for mean density on all plots combined (Table 2;
Fig. 2), with a better ﬁt (F[3,2] ¼ 7.08). The breakpoint for
both piecewise density relationships occurred between 35
and 42% proportion of HQ habitat (Table 2; Fig. 2).
Piecewise linear regression explained 70% more varia-
tion (95 vs. 25%) in mean juvenile recruitment on HQ
plots than did linear regression (F[3,3] ¼ 18.20). This dis-
continuous relationship exhibited a breakpoint in juvenile
recruitment between 24 and 35% proportion of HQ
habitat (Table 2; Fig. 2).
Discussion
Population Dynamics
Our S. aberti population assessment reﬂects the inﬂuence
of both habitat quality and temporal environmental factors
on squirrel demographics, emphasizing the value of rela-
tively long-term studies such as this. The 2.5 times differen-
tial in density between our HQ and LQ habitat plots was
similar to that reported by Brown (1984), Patton et al.
(1985), and Dodd et al. (2003). We found greater variation
in mean LQ plot density among study sites (coefﬁcient of
variation ¼ 37.5%) compared with HQ plot density
(11.9%), possibly reﬂecting landscape inﬂuences. Mean LQ
plot density was greatest at sites with intermediate (42–
52%) proportion of HQ habitat, pointing to beneﬁt of
a habitat mosaic and associated edge effect (Patton 1975a;
Dodd et al. 1998, 2003). The decline in density from 2001 to
2002 occurred after above-average snowfall during winter
2000–2001 induced snow-related mortality (Stephenson &
Brown 1980), coupled with negligible recruitment in 2002.
Dodd et al. (2003) noted a similar difference in mean
recruitment between lightly logged or unlogged (0.24
juveniles/adult female) and intensively thinned sites (0.07
juveniles/adult female) as with our study. Our recruitment
estimates were negligible (<0.08 juveniles/adult female)
across all plots in 2 of 4 years, regardless of patch struc-
tural condition or landscape composition, suggesting most
female squirrels did not breed successfully (Farentinos
1972; Stephenson 1975).
In 2000 and 2002, when only 14 juveniles were trapped,
less than 3% of the 235 female squirrels (vs. >85% in 1999
and 2001) exhibited evidence of successful breeding (e.g.,
lactation). Recruitment was positively related to the
amount of November-to-May precipitation preceding the
breeding season (r2 ¼ 0.935, p ¼ 0.032, n ¼ 4). Dodd et al.
(2003) found that juvenile recruitment was strongly
related to interlocking trees and summer fecal fungal con-
tent, and spring hypogeous fungi fruiting body availability
triggers breeding in S. aberti (Stephenson 1975). Drought
conditions may limit fruiting body production (Dodd et al.
2003) and account for the importance of November-to-
May precipitation.

plot density (graph b), and mean density on combined (HQ and LQ)
plots (graph c) with landscape-scale proportion of HQ habitat for nine
study sites in north-central Arizona, U.S.A., 1999–2002. These piece-
wise regression models (nine in total; Table2) constituted a signiﬁcantly
better ﬁt than linear models to the relationships between population
response and the proportion of HQ habitat. The lines and regression
equations reﬂect different linear relationships above and below

correspond to study area mean values for all years. The shaded areas
correspond to the interval in which thresholds in the independent

Our estimates of mean annual squirrel survival fell
within the range of 0.44–0.78 over eight years reported by
Stephenson and Brown (1980). However, it is considerably
less than the estimate for adult squirrel survival of 0.74
(Lema 2001) or 0.78 (Dodd et al. 2003). We believe the
substantial difference in survival on HQ plots between
years can be attributed to differences in snowfall.
Habitat Relationships
Patch-Scale Habitat Relationships.
Sciurus aberti home
ranges vary by season, sex, age, habitat condition, and
food availability and have been reported as ranging from
1.3 ha (Farentinos 1979) to 26.0 ha (Lema 2001). Squirrel
home ranges on six of our nine sites based on 95% adap-
tive kernel utilization areas (White & Garrott 1990)
ranged from 7.8 to 14.2 ha for juvenile females (n ¼ 25)
and 7.8 to 12.7 ha for adult females (n ¼ 14); home range
varied by proportion of HQ habitat, with the largest home
ranges at sites with intermediate proportions of HQ habi-
tat (Sieg 2002). Given that home range sizes were less
than the patch sizes we assessed, it is not surprising that
squirrels responded to patch-scale variables.
Patton et al. (1985) and Pederson et al. (1987) stressed
the importance of overstory clumpiness and canopy clo-
sure to S. aberti. Number of interlocking canopy trees per
point was the patch-scale attribute most prevalent in mul-
tiple regression models for squirrel density and recruit-
ment, whereas canopy closure (related to interlocking
trees; r ¼ 0.907, p < 0.001) was incorporated into another
model. These results complement Dodd et al. (2003),
where the number of interlocking trees was strongly
related to recruitment at the patch scale. Patton (1975b)
reported that 92% of squirrel nests were found in trees
growing inside a group, with 75% having three or more
interlocking canopy trees. Interlocking canopies are also
needed for juveniles (and adults) traveling from maternal
nests and for protection from aerial and ground predators
(Austin 1990). States and Gaud (1997) found that hypoge-
ous fungi sporocarp production positively correlated with
canopy cover and BA in P. ponderosa forests, and fecal
fungi content was strongly tied to squirrel recruitment
(Dodd et al. 2003). BA, also correlated with interlocking
trees (r ¼ 0.904, p < 0.001), was incorporated into the
density model for all sampling plots combined. Other
studies found BA to be important to S. aberti (Ratcliff
et al. 1975; Patton et al. 1985; Pederson et al. 1987; Prather
et al. 2006).
Stems per hectare of small, sapling-sized (VSS 2) trees
was inversely related to both squirrel recruitment and sur-
vival on HQ plots. VSS 2 trees, far more prevalent today
than in pre-settlement forests (Johnson 1994; Mast et al.
1999; Allen et al. 2002), contribute to decreased forest
health and increased risk of catastrophic ﬁre (Covington
& Moore 1994; Zimmerman 2003). Stands with high densi-
ties of VSS 2 trees exhibited low productivity of sporo-
carps, a consequence of competition among trees that
reduced nutrients available for mycorrhizal fungi (States
& Gaud 1997). Such competition and reduced sporocarp
production likely account for the inverse relationships
between VSS 2 tree density and HQ plot recruitment and
survival.
Landscape-Scale Habitat Relationships.
With the propor-
tion of HQ habitat incorporated in most of our regression
models, we successfully focused our analysis on this vari-
able while limiting the inﬂuence of other landscape-scale
parameters (e.g., patch size). Andren (1994), Andren and
Delin (1994), Gardner et al. (1987), and Lindenmayer
and Franklin (2002) considered the proportion of suit-
able habitat important in describing wildlife response to
landscapes.
The inverse relationship between HQ patch nearest
neighbor distance and LQ plot squirrel density reﬂects the
inﬂuence of proximity to HQ source habitats from which
squirrels immigrate to LQ habitats (Van Horne 1983;
Pulliam 1988). It also reﬂects edge effect where LQ patch
squirrels beneﬁt from the juxtaposition of HQ and LQ
habitats, as described by Lema (2001) and Dodd et al.
(2003).
Landscape Thresholds.
Our determination of landscape
thresholds in proportion of HQ habitat with regard to
both density and recruitment parallels that reported by
Andren (1994), Bowers and Matter (1997), and Krohne
(1997). Andren (1994) concluded that populations may
decline at a rate exceeding that predicted by modeling of
habitat fragmentation when remaining suitable habitat
was 10–30%, depending on relative species mobility and
condition (e.g., aggregation or dispersion of suitable habi-
tat) of surrounding matrix habitats (Lindenmayer &
Franklin 2002). Karieva and Wennergren (1995) and
Lindenmayer and Franklin (2002) stressed that effects of
habitat loss below thresholds could be delayed and irre-
versible once realized. Indeed, Patton (1984:412) cau-
tioned ‘‘HQ habitats (for S. aberti) likely do not exist in
many areas due to the intensity of timber harvest in
Arizona.’’ Our experimental design (e.g., a single, unrepli-
cated gradient of HQ habitat) limits deﬁnitive determina-
tion of a S. aberti population threshold level. However,
both our density and juvenile recruitment results suggest
that thresholds in S. aberti population response occur at
proportions of HQ habitat between 24 and 42%.
With pre-settlement forest conditions being much more
open than contemporary forests (Mast et al. 1999; Mast
2003), why do thresholds in squirrel populations exist
today along a gradient of HQ habitat conditions of consid-
erably greater tree density, BA, and canopy closure? Con-
siderable debate exists regarding the natural range of
variability in pre-settlement forests, as well as regarding
reconstruction
techniques (Allen
et
al. 2002).
Most
accounts of pre-settlement forest structure stress the high
degree of variability on the landscape (Cooper 1960;
Forest Landscape Habitat and Squirrel Populations

White 1985), also described by Fule´ et al. (2002) for sev-
eral P. ponderosa reference sites in northern Arizona.
Reconstructed BA ranged from 4.0 to 45.7 m2/ha, and tree
density from 20.1 to 409.6 trees/ha. Though the extent of
relatively dense forest conditions approximating our HQ
habitat conditions is unknown, we believe such patches
were represented in the pre-settlement landscape.
Management Implications
Our results support an integrated approach to P. ponderosa
forest restoration that includes (1) maintenance of mesore-
serves (as per Lindenmayer & Franklin 2002); (2) thinning
the VSS 2 tree component within mesoreserves; and (3)
management of matrix habitats surrounding mesoreserves.
Our study points to the importance of maintaining the
proportion of suitable HQ habitat as mesoreserves on the
landscape at or above a threshold range of 24–42%. Within
a landscape project area, habitats that best approximate
our HQ habitat should be considered for mesoreserve
retention. Highest S. aberti density (LQ plots) and juvenile
recruitment (HQ plots) occurred in landscapes with inter-
mediate (40–50%) proportions of HQ habitat, underscor-
ing the importance of a habitat mosaic and associated edge
effect (Patton 1975a; Dodd et al. 2003). Our focus on squir-
rel population response along a gradient of HQ habitat ver-
sus patch size limits our ability to make recommendations
on appropriate mesoreserve patch size aside from those put
forth by Lindenmayer and Franklin (2002).
Given the inverse relationship between small, sapling-size
trees and squirrel recruitment and survival in HQ habitats,
understory VSS 2 tree thinning (e.g., ‘‘thinning-from-below’’
prescriptions) of mesoreserves is warranted, yielding beneﬁt
to squirrels and hypogeous fungi on which they feed (States
& Gaud 1997), improving forest health (Mast 2003) and
reducing wildﬁre risk (Zimmerman 2003).
Patch-scale structural habitat condition within the
matrix surrounding mesoreserves has a strong inﬂuence
on species’ occurrence within the landscape, and even par-
tially suitable habitat may lessen the impact of fragmenta-
tion (Lindenmayer & Franklin 2002). This was the case
with our study because squirrel population response was
inﬂuenced by patch-scale habitat condition. Even within
LQ habitats, patch-scale structural habitat parameters
including the number of interlocking trees, BA, and can-
opy closure may inﬂuence squirrel density and recruit-
ment regardless of the proportion of HQ habitat within an
area. Aggregated retention of clumps of overstory trees
providing interlocking canopies and variable BA through-
out the matrix will provide for small refugia (Lindenmayer
& Franklin 2002). Harvest prescriptions that provide for
variable-density thinning will retain or enhance structural
heterogeneity (Carey & Johnson 1995; Chambers &
Germaine 2003).
Mast (2003) stressed that no single prescription or
model should be applied in forest restoration, owing to
inherent variability of P. ponderosa forest ecosystems.
Allen et al. (2002) and Chambers and Germaine (2003)
recommended the use of prescriptions that achieve incre-
mental forest restoration under multiple harvest entries to
minimize short-term impact and preserve critical forest
processes. Such prescriptions have the potential for attain-
ment of squirrel and other wildlife needs along with treat-
ment of priority areas to achieve forest restoration
objectives and wildﬁre risk reduction, while preserving
forest processes and reducing short-term impact on trea-
ted matrix areas. Spatial analysis models (e.g., Prather
et al. 2006) are a valuable tool to plan forest management
projects and assess trade-offs among restoration, fuel
reduction, and wildlife objectives.
