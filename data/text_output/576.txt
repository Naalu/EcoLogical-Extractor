Land managers are routinely applying fuel reduction treatments to mitigate the risk of severe, stand-
replacing ﬁre in ponderosa pine communities of the southwestern US. When these treatments are burned
by wildﬁre they generally reduce ﬁre severity, but less is known about how they inﬂuence post-wildﬁre
vegetation recovery, as compared to pre-ﬁre untreated areas. We re-measured existing plots on the 2002
Rodeo–Chediski Fire 8 years after the wildﬁre to track plant community and exotic species response, as
well as patterns of pine regeneration. We compared areas that experienced high- and low-severity
burning, and also examined how pre-ﬁre treatment (cutting in an uneven-aged harvesting system with
prescribed ﬁre) modiﬁed vegetation response. We detected persistent differences between low- and
high-severity areas for nearly all variables measured. In high-severity areas overall understory plant
cover was 40.6%, nearly three times that observed in low-severity areas; shrub cover was 18.4%, four
and a half times greater than that observed in low-severity areas. We also detected signiﬁcantly higher
exotic forb cover in high-severity areas, although overall exotic response was generally quite low (<2%).
Although this represents a slight decrease in exotic cover since the initial 2004/2005 measurements, the
frequency of several exotic species did increase through time (particularly Tragopogon dubius and Verba-
scum thapsus). Pre-ﬁre treatment resulted in signiﬁcantly higher pine regeneration frequency in treated
versus untreated areas. Within low severity areas, mean pine regeneration frequency was 0.17 in pre-ﬁre
untreated areas versus 0.06 in areas that were not treated before the ﬁre. Within high severity burned
areas, mean pine regeneration frequency was 0.67 in pre-ﬁre treated areas, but was only 0.19 in pre-ﬁre
untreated areas. This treatment effect in high-severity areas may be linked to reduction in the overall
patch size of high burn severity in pre-ﬁre treated areas, which resulted in a more heterogeneous mixture
of low and moderate severity burning in the neighborhood. This pattern decreased distance to seed
source, which likely facilitated the more frequent pine regeneration observed. In addition to the well-
documented beneﬁts of fuel reduction treatments in reducing subsequent ﬁre severity, these data sug-
gest that even where treated areas do burn severely the size of severely burned patches is limited in
extent, which is likely to have important ramiﬁcations for future reforestation and retention of founda-
tion species.

1. Introduction
Severe large-scale ﬁres in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. &
C. Lawson) forests of the southwestern US have been linked to
uncharacteristically high fuels (Covington and Moore, 1994) and
climate warming in recent decades (Westerling et al., 2006). These
ﬁre events have raised several important concerns about post-ﬁre
vegetation communities, three of which we examine here. First,
extensive forest areas that have burned severely may result in per-
sistent conversions to shrublands or grasslands, rather than regen-
erate as forest (Haire and McGarigal, 2008; Savage and Mast,
2005), particularly under a warmer and drier climate (Seager
et al., 2007). The unprecedented size of high-severity burned areas
necessarily means that post-ﬁre pine regeneration in these areas is
not well understood, because it is occurring in relatively novel con-
ditions. In addition, high-severity ﬁre may promote sprouting spe-
cies over seeding species (such as ponderosa pine), where early site
capture by sprouting species limits seeder species establishment
through competition for resources (Barton, 2002; Fulé and Coving-
ton, 1998). Furthermore, ponderosa pine can be considered a foun-
dation species in these communities because it deﬁnes community
structure by creating locally stable conditions for other species,
and modulates fundamental ecosystem processes. The loss of a
foundation species over large, landscape-scale areas can create

novel species assemblages and degrade native habitats (Ellison
et al., 2005).
Second, numerous studies have documented exotic plant spe-
cies invasions following high severity ﬁre events in the Southwest
(Barclay et al., 2004; Crawford et al., 2001; Dodge et al., 2008; Grif-
ﬁs et al., 2001). Such invasions can impact native plant communi-
ties, and also have the potential to alter future ﬁre regimes via
changes to the fuels properties of the native ecosystem (Brooks
et al., 2004). These invasions are not entirely predictable, however,
since other high severity ﬁre studies in the Southwest have docu-
mented a low exotic species response (Foxx, 1996; Huisinga et al.,
2005; Kuenzi et al., 2008).
Third, the extent to which pre-ﬁre fuels treatments will inﬂu-
ence post-ﬁre vegetation response is of concern as land managers
are routinely applying fuel reduction treatments (e.g., thinning
and/or burning) to increase forest resilience and reduce high-
severity ﬁre risk (Baron et al., 2009). These treatments generally re-
duce ﬁre severity by reducing surface fuels, and reducing tree den-
sity and canopy connectivity (Cochrane et al., 2012; Finney et al.,
2005; Fulé et al., 2012; Pollet and Omi, 2002; Strom and Fulé,
2007), yet the inﬂuence of extreme ﬁre weather conditions and
topography can occasionally result in high-severity ﬁre in treated
areas. In both lesser- and more-severely burned sites, pre-ﬁre
treatments are likely to have long-term effects on post-ﬁre recov-
ery, yet these effects are not well known.
To investigate the longer-term effects of pre-wildﬁre treat-
ments and ﬁre severity on pine regeneration and native plant com-
munity recovery, we re-measured plots established after the 2002
Rodeo–Chediski Fire of northeastern Arizona that burned approxi-
mately 189,650 ha (Kuenzi et al., 2008; Strom, 2005). These plots
were originally installed in 2004, when herbaceous understory,
fuels, and forest structure response variables were measured in
relation to ﬁre severity and pre-ﬁre treatment. Kuenzi et al.
(2008) found that low- and high-severity areas had markedly dif-
ferent plant communities 2 and 3 years post-ﬁre, which they pri-
marily attributed to the near-complete loss of overstory trees in
high-severity areas (Kuenzi et al., 2008). These early differences
indicated two drastically different vegetation types on the land-
scape: in the absence of another high-severity ﬁre event, low-
severity areas are likely to remain pine-dominated systems,
whereas high-severity areas have the potential to convert to other
vegetation types (Haire and McGarigal, 2010; Savage and Mast,
2005; Strom and Fulé, 2007). They also detected a low exotic spe-
cies response, contrary to expectations.
Eight years post-ﬁre, we re-visited these plots to examine the
inﬂuence of ﬁre severity and pre-ﬁre treatment on the post-ﬁre
vegetation community. We asked: (1) are the differences in low-
versus high-severity areas persistent 8 years post-ﬁre? And (2)
do pre-ﬁre treated and untreated areas differ within low severity
or high severity areas? For each line of inquiry, we examined a
suite of characteristics that pertain to forest recovery: understory
plant community composition (with particular emphasis on exotic
species response), overstory structure, and pine regeneration.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study area
The study area lies south of the Mogollon Rim in east-central
Arizona on White Mountain Apache Tribal (WMAT) lands. For the
8 years of post-ﬁre vegetation recovery, precipitation by water
year was generally below the 60-year average of 45.0 cm. Total
precipitation during 2010 was 35.2 cm, and 99.8 cm of snow accu-
mulated over the winter of 2009/2010, which is only slightly below
the 60-year average of 102.4 cm. Average maximum and minimum
monthly temperatures were 29.2 C in July and 8.7 C in January.
Weather data were recorded at the Heber Ranger Station by the
Western Regional Climate Center (www.wrcc.dri.edu), which is lo-
cated above the Rim at an elevation of 1984 m (16–311 m lower
than the range of our study sites), approximately 12 km north of
the study sites. It is on the edge of a ponderosa pine/pinyon-juni-
per transition zone and so may have recorded less precipitation
and higher temperatures than our study sites experienced.
The study sites were randomly selected in 2004, ranging in ele-
vation from 2000 to 2295 m, on slopes <45% (average slope was
17.6%) (Kuenzi et al., 2008; Strom, 2005). Study sites were strati-
ﬁed by ﬁre severity classes (low and high), and by pre-wildﬁre
management of (1) no treatment or (2) cut in an uneven-aged sil-
vicultural system and subsequently burned under prescription
(hereafter: untreated, treated) within 11 years prior to the ﬁre.
The speciﬁc cutting prescriptions were not uniform across the
study area, but generally included uneven-aged forest manage-
ment and noncommercial thinning followed by slash disposal. Un-
even-aged managements followed a range of a Q-slope factor of
1.1–1.3, an SDI maximum of 1110 25.5-cm trees ha1, and maxi-
mum diameter of 46–76 cm (18–30 in). Out of the approximately
111,837 ha of the Rodeo–Chediski Fire that burned on WMAT
lands, 13% were cut and burned during the time period used for
this analysis (11 years) (Strom, 2005). Pre-ﬁre treatment areas
were identiﬁed using treatment history data provided by the tribe.
Fire severity classes were determined by a combination of remo-
tely sensed Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (DNBR) maps and
ground-truthing. Of the 111,837 ha WMAT ﬁre area, nearly 20%
was in the high-severity class and 29% in the low-severity class
(with the remaining area classiﬁed as ‘‘moderate’’ severity) (Strom,
2005). The sites were randomly distributed throughout the treat-
ment/severity combinations, resulting in distances between sites
ranging from 0.55 to 9.37 km, and averaging 1.66 km.
The high-severity study areas were seeded immediately post-
ﬁre. The seed mix used on the WMAT lands included Triticum
aestivum L. (common wheat), a sterile exotic species, which was
applied at a rate of 16.8 kg ha1. The remainder of the seed mix in-
cluded species native to the region, but the seed source is unknown
and therefore may not represent locally native genotypes: Elymus
trachycaulus (Link) Gould ex Shinners (slender wheatgrass), Pas-
copyrum smithii (Rydb.) A. Löve (western wheatgrass), Panicum
virgatum L. (switchgrass), Nassella viridula (Trin.) Barkworth (green
needlegrass), Bromus marginatus Nees ex Steud. (mountain brome)
(Bromus marginatus = Bromus carinatus H. & A. (Welsh et al., 1993)),
Bouteloua curtipendula (Michx.) Torr. (sideoats grama), Sporobolus
cryptandrus (Torr.) Gray (sand dropseed), Coreopsis tinctoria Nutt.
(plains coreopsis), Dalea purpurea Vent. (purple prairie clover), Li-
num lewisii Pursh (blue ﬂax), and Rudbeckia hirta L. (black-eyed
susan) (Kuenzi et al., 2008). The study area was not in an active
cattle allotment, but we did observe a few horses, and evidence
of deer and elk.
2.2. Measurement
Six sites were originally installed within each of four treatment
and severity combinations (total N = 24), with three subsample
plots at each site. In 2010 we re-located 70 of the 72 original plots,
such that two sites had only two subsample plots. For consistency,
all ﬁeld protocols follow the original studies (Kuenzi et al., 2008;
Strom, 2005). We used a variable-radius prism plot (basal area fac-
tor 2.3 m2 ha1) for overstory trees using standard guidelines
(Avery and Burkhart, 2001), in which we measured diameter at
breast height (DBH, 1.37 m) and tree height. We tallied all pine
regeneration shorter than breast height in a 3.1-m radius circle.
Since smaller seedlings generally have high mortality rates (Smith
et al., 1997), we were interested in separating the more established
76

seedlings from the very small seedlings, and so divided them into
two height classes, 0–40 cm and 41–137 cm. We used a hemi-
spherical ﬁsheye lens (FC-E8 Fisheye Converter Lens) attached to
a Nikon CoolPix E4300 digital camera to photograph canopy cover,
and then quantiﬁed canopy openness using the Gap Light Analyzer
(Institute of Ecosystem Studies, 1999). In addition, we re-took the
plot overview photos in order to create a photograph series
through time.
We measured understory characteristics using two perpendicu-
lar, 44.8-m transects to create the 1000-m2 plot. Along each tran-
sect, we measured plant canopy cover using cover classes that
were adapted from Daubenmire (1959) (<1%, 1–5%, 6–25%, 26–
50%, 51–75%, 76–95%, 96–100%) in ten 20-  50-cm quadrats, for
a total of 20 quadrats per plot. We recorded cover data by life form
and nativity as well as by species, including trees shorter than
1.37 m, and recorded a species list for the entire plot area.
To directly compare our data, we followed Kuenzi et al.’s (2008)
taxonomic and nativity classiﬁcation which was based on the
USDA-NRCS PLANTS database (USDA-NRCS, 2006). One exception
they made was Portulaca oleracea L. (little hogweed), which was
listed as ‘‘introduced’’ on the PLANTS database, but Kuenzi et al.
(2008) classiﬁed it as ‘‘native’’ based on Byrne and McAndrews
(1975). For species that were ﬁrst detected in 2010, we used the
more current USDA-NRCS PLANTS database (USDA-NRCS, 2011).
When we were unable to identify plants to species, we classiﬁed
them to the lowest taxonomic level we could identify with cer-
tainty, generally to the genus level.
Our preliminary analyses suggested there were some differ-
ences in vegetation response between treated and untreated
high-severity areas, and we suspected that pre-ﬁre treatment
may have limited overall high-severity patch size. Because of the
loss of most overstory trees in high-severity areas, high-severity
patch size can increase distance to seed source, which can be a ma-
jor factor inﬂuencing patterns of seedling recruitment and re-for-
estation. Therefore, we examined spatial patterns of ﬁre severity
in the neighborhood surrounding our high-severity sampling sites.
To do this, we deﬁned the potential seed contribution area for a
site based on seed dispersal distances, which have been estimated
at 1.5 times tree height (McDonald, 1980). Since there is some var-
iability in the literature regarding the minimum seed tree size (Lar-
son
and
Schubert,
1970;
Pearson,
1950)
we
selected
an
intermediate DBH of those reported, 40.6 cm (16 in). We calculated
the average height of trees this size or larger across our entire
study area and calculated the estimated dispersal distance to be
approximately 36 m. We then generated a buffer of at least 36 m
from any subsample plot at each study site, which resulted in an
overall circular site buffer of 180 m from site center (Fig. 1). Then
we used the dNBR severity map to count the number of low, mod-
erate and high-severity pixels within the potential seed contribu-
tion area, and averaged these by treatment. For consistency, all
pixels that partially intersected the buffer were also included in
the pixel counts.
2.3. Statistical methods
For all analyses, we used site level means (n = 24). We analyzed
plant community data using a combination of univariate and mul-
tivariate statistical tests as well as ordination techniques. All plant
community analyses were based on the subset of species that oc-
curred in at least 5% of the plant cover quadrats, and richness anal-
yses were based on species that occurred on at least 5% of the plot
species lists, in order to reduce the inﬂuence of uncommon species
(McCune and Grace, 2002). For overall plant community composi-
tion we used PC-ORD software (McCune and Mefford, 1999) to per-
form two-way PerMANOVA tests, a non-parametric permutation
procedure, on burn severity (high, low) and pre-ﬁre treatment (un-
treated, treated). We used the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure
with 9999 permutations, with a = 0.05. We analyzed differences
among univariate response variables such as cover by life form
and nativity, species richness and pine regeneration relative fre-
quency with PerMANOVAs in PC-ORD, using Euclidean distance
(Anderson, 2001). When the interaction term was signiﬁcant, we
conducted subsequent perMANOVAs for treatment within each
severity class.
We then graphically displayed community data by severity,
treatment, and severity/treatment combinations in ordination
space, using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). We
conducted 250 runs with real data and 250 runs on randomizations
from a random starting point, with an instability criterion of
0.00001. We chose the ﬁnal number of axes based on stress levels
<15 with p-values < 0.05 (Peck, 2010). Finally, we also used
PC-ORD to identify indicator species for severity, treatment, and
severity/treatment combinations. Indicator species analysis yields
a value based on relative frequency and percent cover for each spe-
cies. Species with an indicator value >25 and a p-value (based on a
Monte Carlo test) of <0.05 were considered indicator species for
that severity class (Dufrene and Legendre, 1997). To examine

patterns of pine regeneration we focused on frequency, or the pro-
portion of plots with at least one seedling out of the total number
of plots. Finally, to test for differences in neighborhood severity for
the high-severity sites, we grouped the low- and moderate-sever-
ity pixel percentages, since we considered both of these severity
classes as a proxy for seed sources due to overstory tree retention.
Using the Shapiro–Wilk test we found that these data were nor-
mally distributed (p = 0.3989), and so we tested the differences
in the proportion of low/moderate severity area between treated
and untreated areas with a t test (both tests performed with JMP,
Version 7).
3. Results
We documented the presence of a total of 329 species from 190
genera and 60 families. For multivariate plant community analyses
on cover we focused on the 104 species found on at least 5% of the
cover quadrats, and for richness analyses we focused on the 172
species found on at least 5% of the plot census data. There was a
total of 22 exotic species from eight families, most from Poaceae
(9) and Asteraceae (5); 10 of these were found on at least 5% of
the plots (Table 1).
3.1. Overstory structure
Overstory structure variables were all signiﬁcantly different
(p < 0.001) between low- and high-severity areas, where low-
severity areas had higher basal area and tree density, and lower
canopy openness, due to the loss of most overstory trees in high-
severity areas. None of the forest structure variables were signiﬁ-
cantly different by treatment (Fig. 2 and Table 2). In spite of the
general lack of signiﬁcant effects, the mean responses in low-
severity areas suggest a more open structure in treated compared
to untreated sites, where there was lower average tree density and
basal area and higher mean percent canopy openness. In high-
severity areas, the differences in mean tree density and basal area
in treated and untreated sites were negligible (Fig. 2 and Table 2).
3.2. Plant community composition
Plant community composition based on cover by species had a
signiﬁcant severity by treatment interaction (p = 0.019). Subse-
quent tests for treatment effect within severity class were signiﬁ-
cant both for both low (p = 0.047) and high (p = 0.017) severity.
Within low severity, Solidago spp. were an indicator species for
the treated areas and no indicator species were detected for un-
treated areas. Within high severity, Muhlenbergia virescens Hitchc.
(screwleaf muhly) and ponderosa pine (regeneration under breast
height) were indicator species of the treated areas. In addition, two
species were much more strongly represented in the high-severity
untreated areas than the high-severity treated areas, where un-
treated areas had 42 times more cover of the perennial grass P. smi-
thii and nine times more cover of the shrub-like tree, Robinia
neomexicana A. Gray (New Mexico locust) than the treated areas.
The NMDS ordination of high severity sites generally grouped
by treatment, but the low-severity communities were too variable
to detect any distinct pattern by treatment (ﬁgures not shown). We
also examined NMDS ordinations and indicator species for severity
and treatment alone. The NMDS ordination by severity alone (not
shown) mimicked the results presented in Kuenzi et al. (2008),
where plant communities generally grouped by severity class,
and the overstory structure vectors indicated that these groupings
were driven by the overstory structure differences between low
and high severity.
When the ordinations were generated by treatment alone, dis-
tinct groupings were not visible. Indicator species of high severity
include three shrub species: Arctostaphylos pringlei Parry (Pringle
manzanita), Arctostaphylos pungens Kunth (pointleaf manzanita)
and Ceanothus fendleri A. Gray (Fendler’s ceanothus). Other indica-
tor species for high severity included three native graminoid spe-
cies
seeded
post-ﬁre:
P.
smithii,
Panicum
virgatum,
and
B.
curtipendula (Table 3). No indicator species were detected for
low-severity areas or by treatment due to highly variable plant
community composition.
Species richness was signiﬁcantly higher in high-severity areas
than low-severity areas (p = 0.007) (Fig. 3 and Table 2). This was

driven primarily by greater forb richness in high-severity areas,
where approximately 37 forb species were observed, versus 31
forb species in low-severity areas. Species richness was not signif-
icantly different by treatment (p = 0.198), but the means were
slightly higher in treated areas. For total understory plant cover,
the interaction term was signiﬁcant (p = 0.019). In high severity
areas, we detected signiﬁcantly higher total understory plant cover
in the untreated sites as compared to the treated sites (p = 0.033).
In low severity areas, this trend was reversed although that differ-
ence was not signiﬁcant (p = 0.247).
3.3. Cover by life form and nativity
Tree regeneration, shrub, forb and graminoid cover were all sig-
niﬁcantly higher in high-severity areas as compared with low-
severity areas (Table 2 and Fig. 3). Shrub cover was a substantial
component of the high-severity area plant community, comprising
nearly half of the mean total cover. Shrub dominance was also re-
ﬂected in the identiﬁcation of three shrub species as indicators of
high severity as noted above (Table 3). Cover did not differ signif-
icantly by treatment for any of these life forms, although the
means generally followed the trends in total plant cover (Table 2
and Fig. 3).
Cover of exotic forbs was signiﬁcantly higher (p = 0.004) in
high-severity burned areas (0.68%) versus low-severity areas
(0.11%) (Fig. 3 and Table 2). This difference was driven primarily
by two species, Tragopogon dubius Scop. (yellow salsify) and Verba-
scum thapsus L. (common mullein), that were commonly found on
high-severity plots (32 of 35 plots and 30 of 35 plots, respectively).
Although their overall cover values were low, the prevalence of
these species is reﬂected in their designation as an indicator spe-
cies of high-severity areas (Table 3). There was not a signiﬁcant
treatment effect for exotic forbs. No signiﬁcant patterns were de-
tected for exotic graminoids for either severity or treatment
(Table 2).
3.4. Pine regeneration
Pine regeneration density was highly variable, and so we pres-
ent these data but conducted statistical tests on differences in fre-

quency. Pine regeneration relative frequency for seedlings in the
‘‘established’’ 41–137 cm height class were signiﬁcantly more fre-
quent (p = 0.006) in high-severity areas (0.51) compared to low-
severity areas (0.31). In high severity areas, seedling density in
the 41–137 cm height class averaged 888.9 seedlings ha1 (median
329.5) in high-severity areas and 68.64 seedlings ha1 (median 0)
in low-severity areas. For the combined height classes, seedling
density ranged from 0 to 4283.2 seedlings ha1 in high severity
areas and from 0 to 659.0 seedlings ha1 in low-severity areas. Pine
regeneration relative frequency for seedlings in the ‘‘established’’
41–137 cm height class was also signiﬁcantly different by treat-
ment (p = 0.008), where the frequency was 0.43 in treated areas
versus 0.11 in untreated areas.
When examining pine regeneration within low-severity areas,
this treatment effect resulted in a mean pine regeneration fre-
quency of 0.17 in treated areas and 0.06 in untreated areas (Tables
2 and 4). Pine seedling density in this size class averaged 123.6
(median 0) seedlings ha1 in low-severity treated areas and 13.7
(median 0) in low-severity untreated areas. When the height clas-
ses were combined, seedling densities ranged from 82.4 to 659.0
seedlings ha1 on low-severity treated sites versus 0–329.47 on
low-severity untreated sites. In high-severity areas, mean pine
seedling frequency in the 41–137 cm height class was 0.67 in trea-
ted areas and 0.19 in untreated areas. Pine regeneration density in
this size class averaged 1345.4 seedlings ha1 (median 1276.7) in
high-severity treated areas and 432.44 (median 0) in high-severity
untreated areas (Table 4). When all height classes were combined,
seedling densities on high-severity treated sites ranged from 164.7
to 4283.2 seedlings ha1 versus 0 to 2347.5 seedlings ha1 on high-
severity untreated sites.
3.5. Neighborhood severity
Finally, the examination of neighborhood severity surrounding
high-severity sites detected an average of 47.2% low- and moder-
ate-severity areas combined for the pre-ﬁre untreated sites. This
was signiﬁcantly lower (p = 0.035) than the 73.1% combined low-
and moderate-severity in the neighborhood of the pre-ﬁre treated
sites (Fig. 4).

differences between low- and high-severity burned areas for al-
most all variables measured. In high-severity areas, the resources
made available after the loss of mature trees likely enabled the
higher mean understory plant canopy cover, of which nearly half
was comprised of shrubs. This pattern is consistent with that ob-
served in the earlier investigation by Kuenzi et al. (2008). The
importance of shrubby species in high-severity areas is under-
scored by the appearance of three shrubs (A. pringlei, A. pungens,
C. fendleri) and a re-sprouting tree that exhibits shrub-like patterns
of juvenile growth (R. neomexicana) as indicator species, none of
which were indicators of high-severity in the earlier investigations.
The combination of few to no overstory trees and high shrub cover
has resulted in shrub-dominated communities, unlike low-severity
areas where mature ponderosa pine dominance was maintained
post-ﬁre.
We detected low cover of exotic species throughout the project
area (<2%) in 2010, which is only slightly lower than that reported
in the initial investigation (<3%) (Kuenzi et al., 2008). Drought con-
ditions for the period of recovery may be contributing to the lim-
ited exotic response, and low propagule pressure may also play a
role (Lockwood et al., 2005). The low exotic response detected on
this ﬁre is consistent with that observed by Foxx (1996) and Hui-
singa et al. (2005), but it is inconsistent with several studies that
detected signiﬁcant invasions in severely burned southwestern
ponderosa pine forests. However, it is difﬁcult to compare our data
with these studies because they either did not explicitly state
which exotic species were observed (Grifﬁs et al., 2001) or they
used different deﬁnitions of species’ nativity (Barclay et al., 2004;
Crawford et al., 2001).
Despite the overall low exotic plant cover on the Rodeo–Chedi-
ski Fire, we did observe some important differences by severity
class. In contrast to earlier measurements, exotic forb cover was
signiﬁcantly higher in high-severity burned areas, although it
was still quite low at <1%. The minute difference in exotic forb cov-
er by severity may not be very biologically meaningful, but the in-
creases in frequency since the 2004/2005 measurements for some
exotic species on high-severity plots lend some credence to a dif-
ference between severities. This difference was driven by the prev-
alence of two exotic forbs, T. dubius and V. thapsus. Although cover
values for each were relatively low, the number of plots with these
species steadily increased since the initial investigation in 2004,
particularly for T. dubius. This species was found on 51.4% more
high-severity plots in 2010 than in 2004, and V. thapsus was found
on 11.4% more high-severity plots. This pattern is further reﬂected
in the designation of both species as indicator species for high-
severity in 2010, which was not the case in 2004 or 2005. The in-
crease of V. thapsus through time in cover and frequency among
plots was also observed on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest
portion of this ﬁre (Shive et al., 2013), but is in contrast to the
reductions through time detected elsewhere on the Rodeo–Chedi-
ski Fire (Ffolliott et al., 2011), and after restoration treatments else-
where in the Southwest (Stoddard et al., 2011). On our sites, the
increasing prevalence of these species may become cause for con-
cern because propagule buildup could potentially facilitate more
signiﬁcant invasions in the future, given the availability of suitable
habitat (Lockwood et al., 2005; Moles et al., 2012).
More generally, we observed slightly lower exotic species rich-
ness than that reported in the initial investigation by Kuenzi et al.
(2008), and also detected some changes in exotic species diversity
and abundance. Of the exotic species found on at least 5% of the
plots, ﬁve species observed in 2004 and 2005 were not included
on the 5% subset list in 2010: Agropyron desertorum (Fisch. ex Link)
Schult. (desert wheatgrass), Dactylis gomerata L. (orchardgrass), T.
aestivum, Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten. (bull thistle), and Chenopo-
dium album L. (lambsquarters). Our lack of detection of C. album
may not represent an actual change, since the Chenopodium plants
we encountered were in a juvenile stage that did not allow us to
distinguish between native and exotic Chenopodium species. The
common wheat seeded immediately post-ﬁre was frequent in
2004, infrequent in 2005 (Kuenzi et al., 2008), and entirely absent
in 2010. Our data show that the annual cereal grain did quickly exit
the system as intended by managers (Peppin et al., 2010). Four
exotic species that were observed infrequently in 2004/2005 were
detected on at least 5% of plots in 2010: E. curvula, Poa compressa L.
(Canada bluegrass), P. pratensis, and Erodium cicutarium (L.) L’Hér.
ex Aiton (redstem stork’s bill). The increase in frequency of these
species through time may also be cause for concern in the future
if the trend continues. Only the perennial forb, Sanguisorba minor
Scop. (small burnet), was completely new in 2010, yet it occurred
on only two plots.
It is important to note that some of these exotic species may
have been introduced to the area via past seeding practices. The
perennial grass E. curvula was known to have been seeded in the
course of past management activities before the Rodeo–Chediski
Fire (Kuenzi et al., 2008), and many of the other exotic species
we found have been seeded as part of management activities
throughout the Southwest: P. pratensis, Melilotus ofﬁcinalis (L.)
Lam. (sweetclover), D. glomerata (Fowler et al., 2008). In addition
to past intentional seeding of exotic species, native seed mixes
(such as those used after the Rodeo–Chediski Fire) have the poten-
tial for exotic species contamination (Fowler et al., 2008; Keeley,
2006; Peppin et al., 2010). Because of this risk of contamination,
even seeding with sterile species such as common wheat, which
did exit the system as intended, should be applied with caution.

Pre-ﬁre treatment had no effect on exotic response, but did
have signiﬁcant impacts on several response variables. The detec-
tion of signiﬁcant differences in pine regeneration, total plant cov-
er, and plant community composition by pre-ﬁre treatment
suggests that although severity was the predominant driver of
many vegetation differences, pre-ﬁre treatments can inﬂuence
post-ﬁre communities. In particular, treatment effects on pine
regeneration and total understory plant cover are likely to have
important implications for post-ﬁre reforestation. In the low-
severity areas, the higher mean frequency in treated areas may
be important for concerns about seedling recruitment in post-set-
tlement forests. When all seedling height classes are combined,
each of the pre-ﬁre treated sites had regeneration on at least one
plot. In contrast, four of the six untreated low-severity sites com-
pletely lacked ponderosa pine regeneration on all three plots.
The pine seedling densities we detected are difﬁcult to compare
directly to other studies in areas with intact forest structure due to
differences in the deﬁnition of seedling size. These deﬁnitions var-
ied from recruits less than breast height (Keyser et al., 2008), to
those P20 cm in height and <2.54 cm DBH ⁄(Puhlick et al.,
2012), to those 65 cm DBH (Bailey and Covington, 2002). We de-
tected an average of 96 seedlings ha1 in low-severity untreated
plots and 288 seedlings ha1 in low-severity treated plots; whereas
Bailey and Covington (2002) detected much lower seedling density
(18–60 seedlings ha1) despite their more inclusive deﬁnition of a
seedling. However, all of these observations are considerably lower
than observed by Keyser et al. (2008) (up to 2000 seedlings ha1),
and Lentile et al. (2005) (612 seedlings ha1) in the more mesic
Black Hills of South Dakota. They are also lower than what Puhlick
et al. (2012) reported in the southwestern US (536–14,184 seed-
lings ha1). Although signiﬁcant mortality is possible (Smith
et al., 1997), the densities we observed in the low-severity treated
areas (288 seedlings ha1) may be adequate to provide the 0.4–3.6
trees ha1, per decade that Mast et al. (1999) determined recruited
into the overstory under the pre-European ﬁre regime.
In high-severity areas, the treatment effect on pine regeneration
frequency may be important for reforestation of severely burned
areas. Given the unknown future patterns of climate and distur-
bance, a myriad of trajectories are possible on these landscapes.
However, the current frequencies of pine regeneration suggest that
untreated areas in high-severity burned sites are more likely to re-
main shrub-dominated; whereas treated sites within high-severity
areas have a better chance of recruitment back to pine-dominated
forest. In untreated areas, the low frequency and density of pine
seedlings within high-severity sites indicate a higher likelihood
of conversion to shrublands. In the larger 41–137 cm size class,
only two of six sites had any ponderosa pine regeneration. For both
sizes combined, regeneration occurred on only three of six sites,
averaging 446 seedlings ha1 for both size classes, and two of these
sites had densities <250 seedlings ha1. This number is slightly
higher than those reported in several other studies in the ponder-
osa pine type. On the La Mesa Fire in northern New Mexico, Foxx
(1996) reported roughly 81–121 seedlings ha1; whereas in high-
severity areas of the 2000 Jasper Fire in the Black Hills, no seedlings
were detected in severely burned areas in either year three post-
ﬁre (Lentile et al., 2005) or in year ﬁve post-ﬁre (Keyser et al.,
2008). The densities at these sites are far below the 809 seedlings
ha1 Pearson (1950) recommended to fully re-stock clear-cut areas
under even-aged management (although Pearson does not specify
size class in this recommendation).
We attribute this limited pine recruitment in untreated areas
within high-severity sites in part to distance to seed source. In
these areas, pre-ﬁre treatment functioned to limit high-severity
burn patches, and thereby create more heterogeneous areas
surrounding our sampling sites. There were more low- and moder-
ate-severity burned areas in the neighborhood of sites with pre-ﬁre
treatments where high-severity patch size was limited; whereas
untreated high-severity sites were predominantly surrounded by
more high-severity burned area (i.e. situated in larger patches of
high severity). This likely explains the treatment effect for relative
frequency of pine regeneration in high-severity areas, because low-
and moderate-severity areas generally maintain more overstory
structure that can provide a seed source.
Other studies in ponderosa pine have shown decreased pine
recruitment with increasing distance from unburned, or lightly
burned, edge (Bonnet et al., 2005; Haire and McGarigal, 2008,
2010; Lentile et al., 2005). We also observed lower rates of recruit-
ment in areas farther from lesser-burned edges (in our study, the
proxy for this was the low and moderate severity areas that were
less prevalent around the untreated sites). By increasing the size
of high-severity burned patches, these recent ‘‘mega-ﬁres’’ are
increasing the distance to edge/seed source, which is impacting
forest regeneration. We recognize that regeneration patterns are
complex, and that all large high-severity patches may not face
the same limitations. Long-distance seed dispersal and surviving,
isolated overstory trees within a high-severity patch may act to re-
duce the effective patch size in terms of distance to seed source.
In addition to limited seed source availability, site capture by
shrubs or grasses may also inhibit future pine regeneration. Several
studies in severely burned ponderosa pine forests have linked in-
creased shrub cover to decreased pine regeneration (Haire and
McGarigal, 2008, 2010; Strom and Fulé, 2007). We similarly ob-
served signiﬁcantly lower pine regeneration on untreated sites,
where we also observed signiﬁcantly higher total plant canopy
cover. This cover was primarily comprised of graminoids, shrubs,
and re-sprouting tree species that exhibit shrub-like growth forms
in their juvenile stage (such as Quercus gambelii Nutt. (Gambel
oak),
Juniperus
deppeana
Steud.
(alligator
juniper),
and
R.
neomexicana).
In contrast, the pre-ﬁre treated sites within high-severity had
signiﬁcantly more frequent pine regeneration compared to un-
treated sites. This suggests that these areas generally have a better
chance at reforestation than the untreated sites. However, two of
the treated sites had excessively high pine seedling densities,
which may indicate a trajectory towards overly dense stands. The
densities at these sites (>2000 seedlings ha1) greatly exceed the
809 seedlings ha1 Pearson (1950) recommended to fully re-
stock clear-cut areas. Similarly high densities of pine regeneration
in severely burned areas have been reported in longer-term inves-
tigations by Savage and Mast (2005) and Haire and McGarigal
(2010). Without management intervention, these high-density
sites may be at risk of re-burning severely in the future.
5. Management recommendations
The results from this project ﬁt into a body of literature that
does not indicate a straightforward or easily predictable pattern
of exotic response, suggesting more intensive investigations are
needed. Where existing plots burn over, re-measurements should
be a priority in order to better understand how pre-ﬁre species
assemblages interact with severity and management treatments
to inﬂuence post-ﬁre plant communities. In addition, the results
of this investigation support the continued application of manage-
ment practices that reduce fuels, such as uneven-aged silvicultural
strategies or thinning and burning treatments. These treatments
are important to the persistence of ponderosa pine forests because
they generally reduce ﬁre severity where applied, and even where
burning conditions permit high-severity ﬁre in treated areas, our
neighborhood severity analysis suggests that the patch size is
likely to be smaller than in untreated areas, which may signiﬁ-
cantly impact post-ﬁre pine regeneration. Finally, the detection
82
K.L. Shive et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 297 (2013) 75–83

of important differences in vegetation response by pre-ﬁre treat-
ment within severity class demonstrates that landscapes that
burned under a given severity class are not necessarily alike. As
such, managing post-ﬁre landscapes under the assumptions that
all low- or high-severity areas are the same may ignore important
differences in plant communities and future trajectories.
