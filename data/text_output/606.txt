Fire-Regime Disruption 
and Pine-Oak Forest 
Structure in the Sierra 
Madre Occidental, 
Durango, Mexico

Abstract 
Fire is a common but poorly understood disturbance 
in the forested ecosystems of the Sierra Madre Occi­
dental of Mexico. In this study, fire history, forest 
structure (density, species composition, regeneration, 
forest floor fuels, herbaceous cover, and age of pines), 
and the dendrochronological tree-ring record were 
measured at two unharvested 70-ha pine-oak sites 
near OJito de Camellones, Durango, Mexico. Study 
sites were matched in slope, aspect, elevation, slope 
position, and plant composition, but they differed in 
fire history since 1945 and in forest structure. The 
long-term mean fire intervals (MFI) for all fires at both 
sites up to 1945 were similar-4.0 years at Site 1 
(1744-1945) and 4.1 years at Site 2 (1815-1945)-but 
Site 1 burned only three times at the site margins 
since 1945 while Site 2 had 9 fires that scarred two or 
more sample trees and 15 total fires since 1945. Den­
sity measurements and age and diameter distribu­
tions showed that Site 1 was dominated by numerous, 
younger, smaller trees (mean total basal area of 23.4 
m2/ha and 2730 trees/ha), while Site 2 had fewer, 
older, larger trees (basal area of 37.2 m2/ha, 647 trees/ 
ha), Large, rotten fuel loading and duff depth were 
also greater at Site 1. Because regeneration averaged 
6200 stems/ha at Site 1 and 8730 stems/ha at Site 2 (no 
significant difference), forest density at Site 2 was not 
limited by regeneration capability. The distributions 
of overstory diameter and pine age at both sites indi­
cate that tree establishment occurred in pulses, with 
the largest cohort of trees establishing at Site 1 follow-

ing the 1945 fire. The dense regeneration and heavy 
fuel accumulation at Site 1 are likely to support a 
switch from the former low-intensity fire regime to a 
high-intensity, stand-replacing fire across the site 
when the next suitable combination of ignition and 
weather occurs. Baseline quantitative information on 
fire frequency and ecological effects is essential to 
guide conservation or restoration of Madrean forests 
and may prove valuable for restoration of related fire­
dependent ecosystems that have experienced ex­
tended fire exclusion elsewhere in North America. 
Introduction 
T
hroughout most of western North America north 
of Mexico, fire exclusion associated with Euro­
American settlement has caused a shift from open for­
ests to the dense forests of today, and from a past 
regime of frequent, low-intensity fires to one of in­
creasingly large and severe crownfires (Covington et 
al. 1994). Restoration of these fire-adapted ecosystems 
poses many challenges (Mutch et al. 1993), beginning 
with reconstruction of the fire cycles and the forest and 
fuel structures of presettlement forests. In the Mexican 
Sierra Madre Occidental, however, pine and oak for­
ests exist that have remained under frequent fire re­
gimes until the present, as well as sites that have only 
recently experienced fire exclusion. Study of the eco­
logical structures and processes of these forests may 
provide quantitative baseline information valuable for 
management of a broad range of North American for­
ests. 
Fire is prevalent throughout Mexican forests (Gon­
zalez-Caban & Sandberg 1989) and has been cited by 
prominent pine-forest investigators as the greatest 
threat to conservation of relict forests, tree species in 
danger of extinction, and general forest health 
(Martinez 1948; Loock 1950; Perry 1991), primarily due 
to the destructive effects of fire observed in some areas 
of high human population that were deforested by re­
peated burning and have suffered subsequent erosion 
(Loock 1950; Perry 1991). In general, however, the eco­
logical role and historic frequency of fire in Mexican 
forests is poorly understood (Gonzalez-Caban & Sand­
berg 1989). Until quite recently, little organized fire 
suppression was carried out in most of Mexico. De­
spite current suppression efforts and an active fire pre­
vention and education program, the number of fires 
reported nationwide increased from 6044 in 1983 to 
10,942 in 1988 and nearl y doubled in area to over 
518,000 ha; many are human-caused (Zerecero 1983; 
Gonzalez-Caban & Sandberg 1989). 
Fire is a common disturbance in the Sierra Madre 
Occidental of western Mexico, a diverse and relatively

undeveloped region. The mountain chain forms an 
elevational and latitudinal corridor of pine-oak forest 
connecting temperate and tropical ecosystems of 
North America and serving as a migratory pathway 
and a center of endemism (Perry 1991; Manuel & De 
Jesus 1993). Pine-oak forests of Mexico contain approx­
imately half the world's species in the Pinus (Martfnez 
1948; Perry 1991) and Quercus (Nixon, 1993) genera. 
Due to the isolation and ruggedness of the mountains, 
some unharvested forest areas remain today in the Si­
erra Madre Occidental, 400 years after Spanish coloni­
zation, but the combination of population pressure, 
national economic development plans, and interna­
tional funding sources is likely to result in rapid utiliza­
tion of most Sierran forest resources by the turn of this 
century (Weaver 1993). 
The ecological role of fire has been studied in conif­
erous ecosystems closely related to those of the Sierra 
Madre Occidental in the southwestern United States 
and the northern Mexican border. Mean fire intervals 
(MFIs) prior to European-American settlement of this 
region ranged from 2 to 9 years in forests of Pinus 
ponderosa (ponderosa pine) and Pseudotsuga menziesii 
(Douglas-fir) (Swetnam 1990) and from 4 to 38 years in 
the mixed Pinus-Quercus forests of the border region 
(Dieterich 1983; Swetnam et al. 1992). Dieterich (1983) 
and Baisan and Swetnam (1994) found that frequent 
fires, with an MFI of 4 years, in the Sierra de los Ajos of 
northern Sonora continued up to the 1970s, rather 
than stopping in the 1870s or 1880s as in the south­
western U.S. (Swetnam 1990). Fire exclusion has been 
implicated as a key factor, together with livestock graz­
ing and climatic fluctuations, in the development of 
dense, stagnated forests, high fuel loading, reduced 
herbaceous production, and increased soil erosion 
throughout the western U.S. (Weaver 1951; Cooper, 
1960; Bahre 1991; Savage 1991; Covington & Moore 
1994; Covington et al. 1994). Extended fire exclusion in 
P. ponderosa forests has led to increased incidence of 
crownfires in Arizona (Cooper 1960; Swetnam 1990) 
and further north in Idaho (Steele et al. 1986), and even 
to the "collapse" of the Blue Mountain ponderosa pine 
ecosystem in Oregon (Mutch et al. 1993). Leopold 
(1937) and Marshall (1957, 1962) compared pine-oak 
forests in southern Arizona and northern Sonora and 
Chihuahua, suggesting that heavier grazing and fire 
exclusion in the U.S. forests had led to the dense thick­
ets of "dwarfed" trees, increased erosion, and high 
fuel loading so common north of the Mexico-Ll.S, bor­
der. Prescribed fire has been shown to reduce fuel 
loading and thin regeneration in P. ponderosa forests of 
the southwestern U.S. (Harrington & Sackett 1990) as 
well as in a P. durangensis (Durango pine) forest in 
Chihuahua (Sanchez & Dieterich 1983). Fire regimes 
are not solely a function of fuel accumulation and igni­
tion. Climatic fluctuations are important, and a close 
correlation between climatic and fire cycles has been 
described by Swetnam (1990, 1993) and Swetnam and 
Betancourt (1990) in the southwestern Ll.S, and the 
Sierra Nevada. 
Apart from the aforementioned studies in the border 
region, we are not aware of quantitative studies of the 
frequency of fire in temperate Mexican forests. This 
study is the first to investigate the frequency of fire and 
its effects on forest structure in the central Sierra Ma­
dre Occidental. A survey of the Unidad de Administra­
cion Forestal (UCDFO) "Topia," at the crest of the Si­
erra Madre Occidental in northwest Durango, Mexico, 
led us to select for sampling two paired, unharvested 
pine-oak forest stands that appeared to differ primarily 
in recent fire history. The objectives of this study were 
(1) to determine the historic fire frequency at these 
sites, (2) to compare forest structure under different 
recent fire regimes, (3) to examine the effects of fire on 
forest density, regeneration, and fuel loading, and (4) 
to relate the findings to long-term strategies of conser­
vation or restoration of similar fire-adapted forests. 
Study Sites 
Two study sites approximately 70 ha in size were es­
tablished near OJito de Camellones, latitude 25° 03', 
longitude 106° 13', northwest of Santiago Papasquiaro, 
Durango, at 2200 to 2500 meters elevation (Fig. 1). The 
study sites were located 14 km apart: Site 1 at Arroyo 
Verde in the north, which had no evidence of recent 
fire (Fig. 2a), and Site 2 at Arroyo Laureles in the south 
(Fig. 2b), which had evidence of several recent fires. 
The sites consisted of forest tracts that had never been 
harvested on a large scale, though forest resources had 
been utilized in a dispersed manner by indigenous and 
nonindigenous peoples for centuries. Both sites were 
communally owned by the Ejido Saito de Camellones 
and managed by the Unidad de Conservaci6n y Desar­
rollo Forestal #12 "Topia." Adjacent lands included 
both harvested and unharvested ejido and private 
holdings. 
Annual precipitation at Ojito de Camellones is 2200 
mm (9-year average), with 80% occurring between 
June and October. The reported level of precipitation is 
quite high for the region: average annual precipitation 
at El Cantil, 10 km away at 2250 meters elevation, is 
1540 mm (10-year average); average annual precipita­
tion at San Diego de Tensaenz, 24 km away at 1550 
meters elevation, is 754 mm (10-year average). Records 
of temperature are less available than those of precipi­
tation, but the 1992 maximum and minimum tempera­
tures at La Cienega, 12 km west of Ojito de Camellones 
at 2500 meters elevation, were 18° and - 8°C in [anu-

ary, and 28° and 7°C in August. Soils are of igneous 
origin, primarily rhyolitic with scattered basaltic and 
granitic outcrops (Guizar et al. 1992). Topography is 
characterized by high-elevation mesas dissected by 
steep canyons. Slopes at Site 1 ranged from 5° to 27°, 
averaging 16°. Slopes at Site 2 ranged from 5° to 41°, 
averaging 25°. 
A variety of tree species was encountered at both 
sites. Pines included Pinus durangensis, P. herrerai, P. 
leiophylla (Chihuahua pine), P. engelmannii (pino real or 
Apache pine), and P. ayacahuite var. brachyptera (pino 
blanco or Mexican white pine). Pinus teocote, P. 
lumholtzi (pino triste), and P. arizonica (Arizona pine) 
were encountered at Site 1 only. Oak species found at 
both sites were Quercus sideroxyla (encino prieio), Q. coc­
colobifolia (encino roble), Q. laeta (encino blanco) , and 
other unidentified Quercus spp. Other trees included 
Juniperus deppeana (alligator juniper) and Juniperus sp ., 
Arbutus tessellata (madrone), Arbutus sp., and Alnus sp. 
Prunus serotina (cerezo or black cherry) was found only 
at Site 1. Woody shrubs were sparsely distributed. Arc­
tostaphylos spp. (manzanita) and Ceanoihus spp. 
(Ceanothos) were predominant shrubs. Nomenclature 
follows Gonzalez et al. (1991). Tree species were 
grouped for summary and analysis into pines, oaks, 
and other species. 
Methods 
Sampling was carried out in July and August 1993. 
Thirty circular sample plots 200 m2 in size (radius = 
7.98 m) were established on a 150- by-ISO-meter grid at 
each site (Fig. 3). The species, condition, height, live 
crown ratio, presence of lightning scars, and diameter 
at breast height (dbh) were measured 1.3 meters above 
ground level on all trees over breast height on each 
sample plot. Species and dbh of standing dead trees 
within the plots were also recorded. Increment cores 
were taken at 45 ern above ground level from all living 
pines over 6 em dbh. Additional nearby off-plot pines 
were also measured and cored to increase the spatial 
breadth and temporal depth of the tree-ring sampling. 
A nested circular plot of 40 m2 (radius = 3.57 m) was 
established in the center of each sample plot. For each 
nested plot, the number of woody stems was tailed by 
species, and an ocular estimate of percentage cover by 
herbaceous plants was recorded. 
Fuels were measured along a IS-meter planar tran­
sect laid out in a randomly selected direction from the 
center of each sample plot (Brown 1974). Intercepts of 
the transects with woody fuels in the diameter classes 
0-0.6 em, 0.6-2.5 ern, and 2.5-7.6 em were tailed 
along the first 5 meters; diameters of sound and rotten 
fuels larger than 7.6 em were measured along the en­
tire transect. Depth of litter and duff was recorded 
every 5 meters. 
Fire scars were sampled within or near each sample 
plot. A chain saw was used to sample fire scars on 
living trees by cutting partial cross-sections 30 to 50 ern 
above the ground. Wherever possible, the partial 
cross-sections included both sides of the scar to mini­
mize the possibility of missing fire years (Dieterich & 
Swetnam 1984). Complete cross sections were cut from 
most of the dead sample trees. 
In the laboratory, increment cores were mounted 
and surfaced, and rings were counted. Ring widths 
were measured on older cores and cross-dated to es­
tablish master tree-ring chronologies for each site us­
ing the International Tree-Ring Database Library soft­
ware (Grissino-Mayer & Holmes 1993). The 60 fire 
scars were surfaced and ring width measurements 
were cross-dated with the master chronology (Madany 
et al. 1982; Fritts & Swetnam 1986). Fire scars that 
could not be accurately cross-dated and scars of ques­
tionable origin were not included in the fire histories. 
Woody fuel loading was calculated from the planar 
transect intercept tallies using the method of Sanchez

meters from recent fires, and small fire scars or "catfaces" are visible at the bases of the pines at the right foreground. The

Figure 3. Sampling plots established on 150-by-150-meter

fires as well as for those represented by two or more 
scars. Figure 4 show all the scars found in the samples 
by year of occurrence. 
The average fire occurrence calculated as a 10-year 
moving window was negatively correlated with the 10­
year moving window average of the standardized tree­
ring index from the master chronology (Fig. 5), show­
ing that periods of average reduced tree-ring growth 
corresponded to periods of increased average fire oc­
currence. Individual fire years were generally not syn­
chronized between sites, however, except for 1945 
(Fig. 4). 
Density of the forest overstory was significantly dif­
ferent between the two study sites (Table 1) in a pat­
tern consistent with the thinning effects of frequent 
fire: mortality was concentrated in smaller diameter 
classes. Although Site 2 had a 60% higher basal area, 
Site 1 was an order of magnitude higher in number of 
trees per hectare. Table 2 gives density results by spe­
cies. The age and diameter distributions (Figs. 6 and 7) 
show that Site 1 is dominated by numerous, younger, 
smaller trees, while Site 2 is characterized by fewer, 
older, larger trees. These patterns of diameter distribu­
tion hold true for pines, oaks, and the other species 
(Fig. 7). While no significant differences were observed 
in dead standing basal area (Table 1) and herbaceous 
cover (Table 3), significantly greater loading in large, 
rotten, woody fuels and a deeper duff layer were 
found at Site 1; Site 2 had significantly greater sound 
woody fuel loading (Table 3). 
The height and stem radial growth rates of pines 
were lower at Site 1 than Site 2. Average site index, 
base age 80, for 10 dominant P. durangensis trees be­
tween 60 and 100 years at the sampled height of 45 em 
above ground level at each site was 19.5 meters at Site 
1 and 31.9 meters at Site 2. Average stem radial growth 
from pith to 1992, both for all pines and for Pinus 
durangensis, the dominant pine at both sites, was 0.3 
cm/yr" at Site 1, significantly lower than at Site 2, 
which averaged 0.5 cm/yr" (N1 = 353, N: = 118, P < 
0.001). Among all pines over 100 years old, average 
growth rates of 0.2 cm/yr"! at Site 1 and 0.3 cm/yc 1 at 
Site 2 were significantly different as well (N1 = 18, Nz= 
7, P < 0.003). But no significant difference in average 
growth rate between sites was found for pines over 100 
years old when P. lumholtzi, a slow-growing tree found 
only at Site 1, was excluded, though sample sizes were 
small (N1 = 13, N: = 7, P < 0.1). 
Lightning scars, which appear as long, vertical 
marks left by lightning bolts on tree boles and are dis­
tinct from fire scars caused by cambial death due to 
heat of fires, were found on less than 1% of measured 
trees at both sites: 13 of 2415 (0.5%) total trees over 1.3 
meters tall. The rate of lightning scarring was lower at 
Site 1 (7 of 1898 trees, 0.4%) than at Site 2 (6 of 517

Figure 7. Diameter distributions of pines, oaks, and other species at (left) Site 1 and (right) Site 2. 
was confined to the northwest and southeast margins 
of Site 1; another indicator of dry and nutrient-poor 
conditions, P. engelmannii , was observed at both sites. 
Pines at Site 1 had lower average stem radial growth 
rates and a 38% lower P. durangensis site index than at 
Site 2. But because fire may influence growth through 
thinning of trees and release of nutrients (see Har­
rington & Sackett 1990; Covington & Sackett 1992), 
some component of the greater growth rate at Site 2 
may be related to fire disturbance. Excluding P. 
lumholizi, the growth rates of older trees at both sites­
those well established prior to fire exclusion at Site 1­
were not significantly different, but the sample size of 
trees 100 years old or more was small. In the absence of 
controlled experimental manipulation, site effects and 
disturbance effects cannot be clearly separated. 
Management, or utilization of forest resources, has 
had minimal and dispersed impacts on forest struc­
tures at both sites. Both areas have been open to graz­
ing by cattle, horses, and burros and have been acces­
sible by road for many years; both are close to 
established settlements. Scattered evidence of tree cut­
ting over many years for firewood, building poles, 
roofing shingles, access to beehives, and clearing of 
small parcels for illicit cultivation were seen at both 
sites . No large-scale harvesting, thinning, planting, or 
other area-wide forest management activity has ever 
occurred at either site. 
While long-term fire regimes at both sites were 
similar (Fig. 4), more recent fire regimes have been 
very different: the last fire large enough to scar two or 
more sample trees at Site 1 occurred in 1945, while fires 
scarring two or more sample trees occurred in nine of 
the 47 years between 1945 and 1992 at Site 2. The hy­
pothesis that the role of fire in thinning trees and con­
suming forest-floor fuels is central to the difference in 
forest structure at the two sites is corroborated by tree 
regeneration, age, and diameter distributions.

Fire-Regime Disruption and Pine-Oak Forest Structure 
Regeneration density (all trees below breast height, 
including seedlings) averaged several thousand stems 
per hectare (Table 1) and was not statistically signifi­
cantly different between sites, implying that the re­
duced forest density at Site 2 is not due to an inher­
ently lower regeneration capability. In fact, average 
total regeneration at Site 2 was 40% higher than at Site 
1. Qualitative differences in regeneration were also 
noted between sites: Site 1 had many small, stunted 
pines and shrubby oaks, while Site 2 was dominated 
by small seedlings established after the most recent 
fire. Juvenile needles of many seedlings at Site 2 were 
still shedding seed coats at the time of sampling. The 
primary mechanism for reduction from high regenera­
tion density to low overstory tree density at Site 2 ap­
parently was continued frequent fire. 
Age distributions show that overstory density at Site 
1 increased substantially after fires stopped (Fig. 6). 
Approximately 60% of the pines at Site 1 became estab­
lished after the 1945 fire, i.e., they were between 20 
and 40 years old in 1993at the sampled height of 45 em 
above ground level. While the ages of oaks and other 
species were not determined, their diameter distribu­
tions closely parallel those of the pines (Fig. 7). Diame­
ter distributions for all species at Site 1 follow the same 
pattern as age, strongly skewed toward the smaller 
size classes. At Site 2, in contrast, age and diameter 
were more normally distributed, with only about 20% 
of pines less than 40 years old. The gap in the 30-to-50­
year-old class at Site 2 could have resulted from the 
large 1965 fire (Fig. 4b) killing seedlings established in 
the 1940s and 1950s. 
Both sites had similar levels of fine fuels and litter, 
but because of the frequent recent fires Site 2 had little 
accumulation of duff and large, rotten, woody fuels. 
The dynamics of dead biomass turnover may be ex­
plained by the action of fire: snags and downed fuels 
may rot in the absence of fire at Site 1, while snags at 
Site 2 are likely to fall earlier due to burning of the base 
(Morrison & Raphael 1993) and then be consumed by 
fire before becoming rotten. Nutrients such as nitrogen 
found in dead biomass are often mobilized by fire in 
pine-dominated ecosystems in the southwestern U.S. 
(see Covington & Sackett 1992). Therefore, Site 2 could 
be expected to have higher available nutrient levels in 
the soil while nutrients at Site 1 may be immobilized in 
dead, woody material and duff (see Covington & 
Sacket 1986). Increased nutrient availability and re­
duced competition due to thinning by fire may be re­
flected in the increased growth observed at Site 2. 
Causes and Cycles of Fire. 
Fires in the study region are 
ignited by lightning or by intentional or accidental hu­
man action. Fluctuations in climate and in human ac-
J 
tivity or population density may therefore be reflected 
in the fire history of an area and may affect its ecologi­
cal characteristics. Information about the causes and 
cycles of fire in this study was developed from field 
observation of ignition sources, historical accounts of 
fire use by indigenous peoples, and the relationship 
between tree-ring widths and fire occurrence. 
Sources of ignition observed directly on the study 
sites included both lightning, as shown by lightning­
scarred trees, and humans, evidenced by the presence 
of two to four small, isolated parcels or brechas for illicit 
cultivation at each site. The clearings, of approximately 
200 to 500 m? in size, were opened by felling a small 
patch of trees and torching the dried vegetation. Two 
or three brechas located in the northwest corner of Site 1 
were probably the cause of the recent small fires in that 
area; brechas at Site 2 may be the source of the larger 
fires beginning in the 1980s. 
Foresters and landowners in the region shared the 
opinion that the majority of current fires are of human 
origin, as reported elsewhere in Mexico (Loock 1950; 
Gonzalez-Caban & Sandberg 1989). Human-caused 
fires result from burning of pastures and fields, camp­
fires, and smoking, as well as the brechas (J. G. Paredes 
Perez, Forester, UCDFO "Topia," 1993, personal com­
munication). Lightning is frequent during summer 
storms but is generally accompanied by heavy rain and 
high humidity. Lightning ignitions in the region can 
smolder, however, until drier conditions return and 
favor fire spread (P. Z. Fule, 1994, personal observa­
tion). The incidence of lightning scarring on trees at 
the study sites was less than 1%, although the slope 
position of the study sites on valley walls may make 
them less likely to receiver lightning strikes than 
higher locations. 
Indigenous inhabitants used fire as well. The region 
has a long history of human occupation, including 
Acaxee, Xixime, and Tepehuan peoples who farmed in 
dispersed sheltered areas (Pennington 1969; Gerhard 
1982). Spanish colonization of Santiago Papasquiaro 
occurred in 1593 A.D., followed by establishment of 
mines and communities in the Sierra. No early refer­
ences to forest fire in the immediate study are have 
been found, but descriptions of the Tepehuan people, 
now living in southern Chihuahua, and the Raramuri 
(Tarahumara) people, inhabiting similar forest and 
canyon ecosystems within 100 km of the study sites, 
include numerous accounts of traditional fire use. Fires 
were set regularly to clear agricultural plots and flush 
animals from cover; one early report described exten­
sive regions burned for hunting in the 1700s (Pen­
nington 1963). Even flaming arrows used in warfare 
(Pennington 1969) could have been an ignition source. 
The indigenous population of the region around Santi­
ago Papasquiaro, including the study sites, fell from an

estimated 10,000 in 1500 A.D. to 500 by 1700 A.D., 
while the nonindigenous population increased from 
100 in 1600 A.D. to 6400 by 1800 A.D. (Gerhard 1982). 
While the fire record described in this study extends 
only to the middle 1700s, a longer history could ex­
plore the relationship between human population and 
cultural changes and fire occurrence. 
Average fire frequency increased in periods of aver­
age reduced tree growth (Fig. 5). Peaks of average fire 
frequency, around 1840, 1860, 1880, and 1970, coin­
cided with low periods of tree growth recorded in the 
chronology, although fire increases around 1870 and 
1920 did not. Weather records are insufficient for cor­
relation of temperature or precipitation with tree-ring 
widths. But the correlation between detrended tree­
ring series from two sites with nonsynchronous distur­
bance histories suggests that the tree-ring signal is re­
lated to climatic variation rather than response to 
disturbance. Extensive correlation between recon­
structed climate and fire occurrence has been observed 
in related forest ecosystems in the southwestern U.S. 
(Swetnam 1990; Swetnam & Betancourt 1990). The pri­
mary climatic factor influencing tree-ring growth is 
likely to be lack of moisture rather than cold tempera­
tures at the latitude of the study sites (Fritts 1976). 
Implications of Fire Exclusion. Although fire has been ex­
cluded from most of Site 1 since 1945, the reason for 
fire cessation is not known. Settlements exist within a 
few km of the site, but organized fire suppression has 
begun only recently. A few small fires have occurred 
on the site since 1945, and the opposite slope of the 
Arroyo Verde valley burned with substantial tree mor­
tality within the last few years. Apart from simple 
chance, the lack of fires might be due to external 
changes such as abandonment of nearby farmlands, 
effects of harvest or development on adjacent lands, or 
local changes in land-management practices. 
When conditions of suitable weather and ignition 
next coincide, the subsequent fire at Site 1 is likely to 
be stand-replacing. Assuming that the pre- 1945 fuel 
conditions were similar at both sites due to their simi­
lar long-term fire histories, loading of large, rotten, 
woody fuels has quadrupled and duff depth has dou­
bled at Site 1 relative to Site 2 since 1945 (Table 3). 
Rotten fuels are particularly conducive to fire spread 
due to their ease of ignition (Sackett 1979). Although 
Site 2 had higher loading of large, sound, woody fuels, 
the total woody fuel loading at Site 2 was only two­
thirds that of Site 1. Finally, Site 1 has a much higher 
density of small trees (Fig. 7), which can serve as fuel 
ladders carrying fire into the forest canopy. Total 
woody fuel loadings at both sites fall into a relatively 
low-danger fuel class according to a fire danger system 
developed by Zapata (1990), who compared forest-
floor fuel loading with observed wildfire damage in the 
forest administrative unit including the study sites, but 
the classification system does not consider differences 
between large sound and rotten fuels, forest-floor 
depth, live fuels, or fuel-ladder structure. 
Perhaps the strongest evidence for predicting stand­
replacing fire at Site 1 is that the most recent fire (1991) 
at Site 2 crowned through approximately 5 ha, causing 
complete mortality adjacent to the northern end of the 
study site. The area was not included in sampling be­
cause of a subsequent salvage harvest. If this relatively 
open forest, with fuels reduced by fires in 1980 and 
1986, could still support a limited crown fire during a 
favorable period of tree growth (Fig. 5), then the 
denser forest and heavier fuel loading at Site 1 unques­
tionably appear capable of supporting a crown fire un­
der similar weather conditions. A half century of de 
facto fire exclusion may have been sufficient to move 
the forest at Site 1 from a frequent, low-intensity fire 
regime to an infrequent, high-intensity fire regime. 
Conclusions 
Comparing two paired unharvested pine-oak forest 
sites, we found that both had similar long-term re­
gimes of fire disturbance. The fire regime was dis­
rupted at one site after 1945, however, leading to an 
extended period of virtual fire exclusion up to the 
present. Forest structures such as overstory and un­
derstory density, distribution of tree diameters and 
ages, and forest-floor fuel loading and the mix of fuel 
components, were strongly correlated with this dis­
ruption in the fire regime: the fire-excluded site was 
dense with small trees and heavy, rotten fuels, while 
the frequent-fire site remained relatively open with 
fewer and larger trees and a lighter fuel load. These 
forest characteristics are consistent with the thinning 
and fuel-reducing effects of fire as well as the increased 
forest density observed on similar fire-excluded sites 
elsewhere in western North America. 
Information from unharvested sites may prove valu­
able for the ecological restoration of Madrean forests 
and related fire-dependent ecosystems. First, manage­
ment strategies for these forests, whether for resource 
development, conservation, or restoration of degraded 
lands, should be based on a thorough understanding 
of the historic frequency and ecological role of fire dis­
turbance. Second, baseline data on the characteristics 
of ecosystems structures and processes can serve to 
guide restoration efforts in fire-excluded forests, not 
through simply mimicking the conditions of a particu­
lar unharvested frequent-fire site but rather by adding 
to the development of a broad picture of the pre-exclu­
sion forest, a picture that also includes reconstruction 
of previous forest structures, disturbance history, and

Fire-Regime Disruption and Pine-Oak Forest Structure 
historical accounts of earlier conditions. Finally, the 
comparison between the frequent-fire and fire-ex­
cluded sites in this study offers one example of the 
speed and extent of the ecological changes that may be 
expected following disruption of the historic fire re­
gime. 
Only a small fraction of Mexican forest ecosystems 
has received detailed ecological study. Landscape­
level investigations synthesizing forest structures and 
fire regimes across larger areas of the Sierra Madre 
Occidental, both in the humid region of this study as 
well as the larger area of dry pine-oak forest, are 
needed to determine the large-scale effects of historic 
and recent fire frequencies, intensities, and sizes. Such 
studies should be undertaken soon, while unhar­
vested areas remain available. Additional work is 
needed to extend the tree-ring chronology, fire his­
tory, and structural variation in the region on both 
unharvested and harvested sites. Correlation between 
climate and tree-ring chronologies should be examined 
wherever adequate weather records exist in the region. 
Finally, the potential for application of prescribed 
burning to reduce fuel loads, maintain open and fast­
growing forests, and prevent the development of con­
ditions leading to synchronous high-intensity fires 
should also be explored experimentally. Unlike some 
sites in the southwestern U.S., where forest structure 
has changed so much that prescribed burning alone is 
insufficient to restore natural conditions (Bonnicksen 
& Stone 1985; Harrington & Sackett 1990), many lands 
in the studied region potentially could be moved from 
a regime of frequent wildfires to one of frequent pre­
scribed fires .
