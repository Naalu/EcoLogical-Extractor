C
atastrophic wildfires have torn
through the nation’s forests in
recent years, fueling intense de-
bate about who or what is responsible
for the devastation to property and nat-
ural resources. Although years of
drought and decades of ﬁre suppression
policies are undoubtedly culpable, the
use of USDA Forest Service adminis-
trative appeals by environmental groups
has been cited as a major impediment
to implementation of fuels reduction
projects that might prevent future cata-
strophic ﬁres (Vaughn 2003). The For-
est Service, for example, invokes the
term “analysis paralysis” and blames the
ﬁling of appeals for delaying projects in
national forests—projects championed
for reducing the risk of catastrophic,
stand-replacing wildﬁres (USDA Forest
Service 2002a, 2002b). 
The appeals process that is the sub-
ject of scrutiny today is not new;
rather, it is the result of a long history
of rulemaking, legislation, and public
debate. Almost since its creation in
1905, the Forest Service has had a
process permitting the public to chal-
lenge its decisions. The process has
changed over time, from informal to
formal review and from semi-indepen-
dent adjudication procedures to inter-
nal administrative review. 
Until 1989, all appeals were handled
under the same set of regulations in the
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). In
1989, the Forest Service separated pro-
cedures for forest plan appeals from
other appeals. Subsequently, the Inte-
rior Appropriations Act for fiscal year
1993 legislatively mandated appeals for
projects and activities documented
under the National Environmental Pol-
icy Act (NEPA), making the Forest Ser-
vice the only federal agency with a
statutorily mandated NEPA appeals
process, and separate regulations were
established. Today, there are appeals for
three types of agency activities: forest
plans, revisions, and amendments (36
CFR 217); permits or written autho-
rizations relating to use or occupancy of
the national forests (36 CFR 251); and
NEPA project decisions (36 CFR 215).

Using publicly available electronic records, we compiled a database to compare administrative
appeals of USDA Forest Service projects. The database contains 3,736 appeals decided na-
tionwide from January 1997 through September 2002. The data show that the appeals process
is used by a wide variety of interests, including individuals, tribes, and businesses as well as en-
vironmental groups, to challenge a wide range of projects, including development, recreation,
and grazing as well as fuels reduction. The agency denied in full 54.6 percent of all appeals filed.
The database provides a tool for informing the debate over appeals of Forest Service decisions
but also opens up new lines of inquiry.

The present debate brings to light
issues long cited by both proponents
and opponents of the appeals process
(Baldwin 1997; Germain et al. 2001;
Cortner et al. 2003). Supporters of the
system point to the opportunities that
appeals allow for additional and mean-
ingful public participation in the deci-
sionmaking process and the political
accountability that the system provides
(Manring in press). It is also argued
that appeals lead to more ecologically
sensitive and socially acceptable project
designs. 
Critics argue that appeals are costly
and procedurally onerous, co-opt re-
sources (time, personnel, financial)
that could be used more productively
elsewhere, and act as deterrents to ef-
fective predecisional public involve-
ment and stakeholder collaboration.
Critics also contend that most appeals
are frivolous and are being used as tools
of obstruction rather than to solicit
beneﬁcial outcomes. 
The introduction of President
Bush’s Healthy Forests Initiative in
August 2002 elevated the administra-
tive appeals process on the national
political agenda. The initiative focused
on streamlining environmental review
of Forest Service projects. Legislation
was introduced in both the 107th and
the 108th Congresses to implement
these expedited reviews and to repeal
the legislative mandate for administra-
tive appeals. In late November 2003,
Congress passed the Healthy Forest
Restoration Act. The new law limits
the types of projects subject to appeal
and who is eligible to appeal, and it
also alters the judicial review process.
In June 2003, the Bush administra-
tion also ﬁnalized changes to the regu-
lations pertaining to projects subject to
the NEPA planning process. The new
rules expand the deﬁnition and appli-
cation of “emergency situations” and
place new limits on who may file an
appeal. The changes also provide more
stringent guidelines for commenting
on proposed actions (requiring “sub-
stantive comments”), as well as set new
requirements for appeal content (68
FR 33582). 
Those legislative and administrative
actions have addressed concerns that the
administrative appeals process has con-
tributed to a decline in forest health and
an increased risk of catastrophic wild-
fire, primarily by stalling or canceling
fuels reduction and ecological restora-
tion projects. However, the administra-
tive appeals process pertains to a wide
variety of Forest Service activities, not
just fuels reduction. The purpose of our
project was to describe the universe of
administrative appeals; our results
demonstrate the far-reaching conse-
quences of administrative appeals re-
form done in the name of forest health.
The Database
Determining how many appeals the
Forest Service processes each year, who
the appellants are, and what types of
projects are appealed is not as simple as
might be expected. Even though se-
lected anecdotal evidence has been
abundantly cited and used as the basis
for policy changes, there has been no
comprehensive and systematic analysis
of the appeals process. The database
created for this study provides those in-
terested in the administrative appeals
process a tool for answering many of
the questions surrounding this politi-
cally contentious issue.
The database includes 3,736 admin-
istrative appeal records of regional deci-
sions (forest plan appeals are not in-
cluded, but plan amendments reviewed
at the regional level are) reached be-
tween January 1, 1997, and September
30, 2002, and available on the Forest
Service’s website (www.fs.fed.us/forum/
nepa). The Forest Service is required to
post its appeal decisions online, as the
result of a 1999 court settlement be-
tween the agency and the Wyoming
Outdoor Council. Because of the date
stipulated in the agreement, as well as
the seven-year ﬁle retention policy for
appeals, it is unlikely many records
would be available before 1996. 
To accommodate any lag time in-
volved in posting appeal documents
online, we chose September 30, 2002,
as the end point for the database. The
time lag varies greatly across national
forests and regions—in some instances,
newly posted decisions were more than
18 months old. Occasionally, forest
websites also indicated there were no
records of appeals. It is not possible to

determine whether this is because no
appeals were filed or because Forest
Service records are not available. Al-
though we cannot say with certainty
that the universe of appeal decisions
has been captured, our data set in-
cludes all appeal decisions made be-
tween January 1, 1997, and September
30, 2002, that were posted as of Octo-
ber 17, 2003.
We sorted the data along several di-
mensions to provide an overview of ad-
ministrative 
appeals 
nationwide.
Analyses of appeals nationally included
the number of appeals decided per cal-
endar year, regional distribution, types
of appeal (by CFR section), types of
disposition, appellants, and types of
projects appealed.
Major Findings
Year. When sorted by full calendar
year, the nationwide data show that the
highest number of decisions (950)
were made in 1998. Calendar year
1999 had the second-highest number
of decisions, with 655; 583 appeals
were decided in 2000, and 621 were
decided in 2001. The fewest decisions
(520) were made in 1997. During the
ﬁrst nine months of 2002, 407 appeals
were decided.
Region. The most appeals were de-
cided in Region 5 during the study pe-
riod, with a total of 690 appeals (table
1). Region 1 recorded a total of 648.
Together, Regions 1 and 5 were re-
sponsible for 35.8 percent of appeals
filed between January 1997 and Sep-
tember 2002. However, Region 1 actu-
ally reviewed the most appeals (567),
dismissing only 81 appeals without re-
view. Region 5 dismissed the most ap-
peals without review, with 285 dis-
missals. The fewest number of appeals
were decided in Region 10 (117), with
the next fewest number of cases de-
cided in Region 9 (312).
CFR Section. Nationwide, 77.5 per-
cent of all appeals (2,897 of 3,736)
challenged NEPA project decisions,
ﬁled under 36 CFR 215 (table 2). Ap-
proximately 16 percent of appeals (590
of 3,736) were filed under 36 CFR
251, which pertains to decisions re-
garding special use permits and other
authorizations for occupancy and use
of national forest lands, such as grazing
permits. Of all appeals, 4.2 percent
(157 of 3,736) contested forest plan
amendments reviewed at the regional
level, ﬁled under 36 CFR 217. The ap-
propriate CFR section was unidenti-
ﬁed for 92 cases (2.4 percent).
Disposition. Of all appeals processed
nationwide during the study period,
the appellants’ requested relief was de-
nied in full in 2,039 cases (54.6 per-
cent) and granted in full in 292 cases
(7.8 percent) (table 3). Of just the ap-
peals dismissed without review, nearly
33 percent (329 of 1,004) were dis-
missed because the Forest Service with-
drew the decision under appeal. The is-
sues raised by the appellant(s) were re-
solved informally in approximately 14
percent of the cases (144 of 1,004) dis-
missed without formal review. 
Appellants. The database indicates
that 738 different appellants (not in-
cluding “private citizens”) ﬁled appeals
during the study period. Private citi-
zens ﬁled or joined in the most appeals
(1,342 of 3,736, or 35.9 percent). Of
the 1,342 appeals with a private citizen
listed as an appellant, 1,152 (85.8 per-
cent) were filed independently—that
is, not filed jointly with an organiza-
tion or business—and 690 (59.9 per-
cent) of those were appeals of NEPA
project decisions, ﬁled under 36 CFR
215. When all appeals filed under 36
CFR 215 are considered, private citi-
zens filed independently or joined in
30 percent (870 of 2,897). Of all ap-
peals with a private citizen appellant,
64.9 percent (871 of 1,342) were ﬁled
under this CFR section (see table 4).
With the exception of private citi-
zens, the most active appellants were
environmental organizations. The For-
est Guardians (389) and the Ecology
Center (230) filed the most appeals.
The 18 most active appellants nation-
ally (i.e., private citizens as a group plus
17 organizations) account for nearly 50
percent of all appeals filed (including
only those ﬁled independently as an in-

dividual or an organization). When we
consider the number of appeals joined
by one or more appellants, the percent-
age grows beyond 50 percent. For ex-
ample, the Forest Guardians ﬁled 301
appeals independently but joined with
at least one other group in another 88
appeals. All of the most active organi-
zations filed more than 90 percent of
their appeals against NEPA project de-
cisions under 36 CFR 215, with the
exception of the Southern Appalachian
Biodiversity Project (table 4).
Project types. The coding of project
type was developed as the database was
constructed, based on our interpreta-
tion of the appeal decision letters
posted on the websites, as the Forest
Service has not standardized a format
or definitions for reporting project
type. As table 5 (p. 18) indicates,
nearly 33 percent (1,232 of 3,736) of
the appeals in the data set related to a
timber project, such as salvage, thin-
ning, or a commercial sale—either
solely or in conjunction with another
type of project. During this period,
13.4 percent of appeal decisions were
related to grazing allotments. Fuels re-
duction was cited as at least part of the
project objectives in 154, or 4.1 per-
cent, and restoration in 139, or 3.7
percent, of all appeals. Project type
could not be determined in 45 appeal
ﬁles, or 1.2 percent.
Discussion
The database provides critical infor-
mation to inform the appeals debate,
especially (1) who files appeals, (2)
where appeals are ﬁled, (3) what types
of projects are appealed, and (4) how
the Forest Service decided the appeals.
The Forest Service has not compiled
these data, and there was no easy way
to answer these questions before con-
struction of this database. 
Legislative and rule changes to 36
CFR 215 have the potential to affect a
significant percentage of appeals. Al-
though the perception has been that
environmental groups are the primary
appellants using project appeals to
delay Forest Service projects, the data
paint a far more complex picture. For
example, individuals ﬁled or joined in
approximately 30 percent of all NEPA
project appeals nationally. Of all ap-

1 A reviewed appeal meets all regulatory requirements for submission and is considered by a 
Forest Service ofﬁcial on its merits. The relief requested by the appellant(s) may be denied in full,
granted in full, or some combination thereof.
2 An appeal may be dismissed without a decision on its merits for a variety of reasons, including
the withdrawal of a decision by the agency, a decision not being subject to the appeals process,
informal resolution of the issues, or procedural errors (e.g., timeliness, content requirements, 
project scope, and lack of standing).

18
peals with an individual listed as an
appellant, 85.8 percent were not filed
in conjunction with any other organi-
zation. Appeals filed by individuals
concerned, for example, the siting of
new buildings or telecommunications
equipment, access to recreational areas
for skiing or equestrian use, and
changes in grazing allotments. 
Thus significant interests (and not
all of them environmental) are likely
to be affected by changes in the ad-
ministrative appeals process. Limiting
input from individuals, environmental
groups, tribes, companies, and other
government agencies could have unan-
ticipated consequences, as could the
predecisional process approved by
Congress. 
Preliminary examination of the
types of projects appealed leads to
more questions about how the Forest
Service designates and deﬁnes activities
within a project. For example, is there a
consistent suite of activities included in
all fuels reduction projects across For-
est Service regions or forests? More-
over, because perceptions may vary
considerably between the agency and
appellants about the actual intent and
scope of a project, how the project is
(or should be) labeled is often no small
point of contention. Inconsistencies in
definition also limit the ability of re-
searchers or the public to draw conclu-
sions about the relationship between
certain categories of projects and delays
without conducting in-depth case ex-
amination of the particular issues in-
volved in an appeal.
The database contains information
about the types of decisions made by
the Forest Service—both reviewed
cases and dismissed cases. Nationally,
nearly 55 percent of all filed appeals
were denied in full. A significantly
large number of cases were dismissed
because the Forest Service withdrew
the decision under appeal; almost 33
percent of appeals dismissed without
review fell within this category. 
That relationship merits further ex-
amination. Why were the decisions
withdrawn? Was it the result of issues
raised in an appeal, or was it a proce-
dural or strategic decision by the
agency? The Forest Service may dismiss
an appeal based on several factors, in-
cluding lack of standing by the appel-
lant, lack of a postmark or failure to ﬁle
in a timely manner, or in some cases,
because the appellant sought no relief. 
The database does not answer the
question whether the appeals filed
could be considered “frivolous.” Like-
wise, research and analysis beyond the
database would be needed to explore
the question of how the granted ap-
peals affected the projects’ eventual im-
plementation. In addition, little is
known about the informal resolution
process. The Forest Service and appel-
lant(s) resolved issues informally in
144 cases, which accounts for more
than 14 percent of all appeals dis-
missed without formal review. 
Do appeals delay project implemen-
tation, considering the complete time-
line from project inception to ﬁnal ap-
peal decision? Policymakers and Forest
Service ofﬁcials have used the issue of
delays repeatedly as justification for
changes in the appeals process. How-
ever, it is impossible to answer this
question based on the limited data
posted on the agency’s websites. Only
about 37 percent of the posted records
included information on the filing
date, and even then, online records in-
clude no information about when a
project was conceived or initiated. 
Examination of primary source
records, such as the project ﬁles avail-
able at the district ofﬁce where the ap-
peal was filed, is needed to determine
time spans between various project de-
cisions, initial appeal filings, and the
appeal decision. As US General Ac-
counting Ofﬁce reports concerning ap-
peals of fuels reduction activities
demonstrate (GAO 2003a, 2003b), it
is extremely difficult to discern the
time it takes to process all types of ad-
ministrative appeals, from project in-
ception to appeal decision. However,
one must also realize that no agreed-
upon benchmark exists for determin-
ing what constitutes a project “delay.” 
Although the time between the ﬁl-
ing date of an appeal (or project deci-
sion date) and project implementation
can be calculated, many delays are
often indirect rather than direct, with
intangible effects often far removed
from the timing of the actual appeal.
For instance, winter weather condi-
tions may delay timber salvage for an
additional season. The environmental
assessment process itself and the avail-
ability of agency staff trained to do en-
vironmental assessments may be more
constraining. In the case of fuels reduc-
tion projects, other sources of delay
(weather, stafﬁng, limited funding, lack
of contractor bids, wood utilization is-
sues, the risk aversion of local ﬁre man-
agers if prescribed ﬁre is involved) may
also affect project implementation. 
It can be argued that the Forest Ser-
vice’s fear of appeals has prolonged the
predecision process. But the additional
time spent on document preparation
(“bulletprooﬁng”) cuts several ways. It
may indeed prolong the process, but
efforts to avert appeals can also prompt
the agency to build a stronger scientiﬁc
or economic justification for its deci-
sions and be more sensitive to public
objections to proposed projects (Cul-
hane 1981; Jones and Taylor 1995). 
Concerns about delays may also re-

flect the perspectives of companies
seeking contracts for forest work,
whose managers wonder whether the
Forest Service will implement the pro-
ject in a timely manner. Community
members might also criticize the ap-
peals process, especially if they are seek-
ing forest-related jobs or worry about
wildfire risk. Moreover, whether the
appeals process achieves either undesir-
able or desirable outcomes is highly
subjective, requiring evaluation from
several perspectives and in the context
of the goals of each stakeholder af-
fected by the appeal. 
Construction of the database alone
does not yield definitive conclusions
about the impacts of appeals—ecolog-
ically, economically, socially, or politi-
cally. What happens as a result of an
appeal? Arguments have been made
that despite the considerable time
spent dealing with appeals and beeﬁng
up environmental documentation, the
project does not change substantially.
Tangible results can be traced only by
comparing initial proposals with on-
the-ground implementation. Such de-
terminations, however, will require fur-
ther analysis, including comprehensive
and systematic examination of a repre-
sentative sample of cases. Only then
can questions about how appeals con-
tribute to action or inaction on Forest
Service lands, with what consequences
and for whom, be more fully and more
accurately addressed.
