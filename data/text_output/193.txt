MULE DEER AND FOREST RESTORATION
After several decades of growth during the early
and mid-1900s, many mule deer (Odocoileus
hemionus) populations recently have declined
(Julander and Low 1976, Clements and Young
1997). Population persistence within a particular
habitat depends upon availability of resources to
meet critical needs of members of the population
(e.g., Smith 1980).
Critical needs of mule deer
include protection from predators and weather
(Miller 1970, Smith and LeCount 1979, Smith et al.
1986,Parker and Gillingham 1990) and high-quality
forage (Dietz and Nagy 1976). Bed sites afford deer

Characteristics of mule deer day-bed and
forage sites in current-condition and
restoration-treated ponderosa pine forest
Stephen S. Germaine, Heather L. Germaine, and Susan R. Boe
Abstract We characterized microhabitat (structure and microclimate) at 236 mule deer
(Odocoileus hemionus) day-beds, 152 diurnal forage sites, and 439 random locations
during summers of 1998–2000.  Our objectives were to 1) identify important microhab-
itat characteristics of day-beds and forage sites in untreated forest, 2) compare relative
availability of bed and forage sites having these characteristics between forest types, 3)
determine whether mule deer selected either forest type disproportionately for these
activities, and 4) compare characteristics of day-bed and forage sites between forest types.
Mule deer selected bed and forage sites with specific characteristics in untreated forest
each year.  Site temperature and canopy closure were the most influential attributes in
bed-site selection, while forage availability best described forage sites.  Availability of
characteristic day-bed microhabitat was reduced 50–100%, while forage characteristics
increased 31–66% each year in treated forest.  Foraging mule deer selected treated forest
in 1 year but demonstrated no preference in 2 years.  Mule deer continued to use day-
beds in both forest types each year as expected based on proportional area of each for-
est type, but did so in treated forest in 1999 by utilizing a novel suite of microhabitat fea-
tures.  Bed sites in each forest type had similar levels of midstory canopy closure, but
treated forest bed sites were warmer in one year, exclusively located under oaks (Quercus
gambelii) rather than conifers, and less concealed than untreated forest beds.  Small oak
stands were the only dense patches retained in the restoration prescription we examined
and provided marginal thermal and hiding cover for day-bed use by female mule deer.
These differences may increase thermoregulatory stress and the potential for increased
disturbance and predation of female mule deer and fawns during summer.  We recom-
mend retaining >0.04-ha patches of dense bedding and hiding cover in areas where both
forest restoration and mule deer are management concerns.

protection from both weather and predators (Geist
1981, Armstrong et al. 1983, Kufeld et al. 1988,
Ockenfels and Brooks 1994) and are located non-
randomly within the range of habitat structure pres-
ent (Smith et al. 1986, Kufeld et al. 1988, Gerlach
and Vaughan 1991). Forage availability and quality
on summer range determines body condition of
mule deer as they head into winter (Snider and
Asplund 1974).
Forage composition on summer
range also affects doe productivity and lactation as
well as fawn survival and growth, and determines
productive capacity of mule deer habitat (Swank
1958, Zwank 1976, Pederson and Harper 1978).
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) is an impor-
tant vegetative type that is commonly included
within summer home ranges of mule deer (Urness
et al. 1975, Currie et al. 1977, Pederson and Harper
1978). However, decades of fire suppression and
even-aged timber management have rendered pon-
derosa and other coniferous forests densely
stocked,with closed canopies that preclude growth
of shrubs and herbs (Covington and Moore 1994,
Kolb et al. 1994). Reductions in herbaceous and
shrub productivity and diversity, senescence of
existing browse, and stand-type conversions from
fire-tolerant to intolerant vegetation have all con-
tributed to mule deer declines in recent decades
(Julander and Low 1976,Clements and Young 1997,
Carpenter 1998).
Independent of mule deer concerns, current for-
est conditions and related risk of catastrophic wild-
fires have motivated efforts to improve ponderosa
pine forest health and reduce fire danger, and
restorative treatments are now proposed for
>81,000 forested hectares (ha) annually in Arizona
and New Mexico by 2010 (Anonymous 2001).
Restoration treatments attempt to mimic tree spa-
tial distributions, canopy closure, fire return fre-
quencies, and herbaceous composition believed
present prior to Euro-American settlement
(Covington et al. 1997, Fulé et al. 1997, Mast et al.
1999). To effect these changes, restoration treat-
ments reduce basal area, overstory canopy, stem
density of unnaturally overstocked stands, and
organic litter,and increase productivity and diversi-
ty of understory vegetation. In addition,prescribed
fire also is being proposed at frequent intervals
(6–7 years) to maintain understory vegetation in a
grass–herb-dominated state.
Treatments of this type have great potential to
affect mule deer living in ponderosa pine forest
habitats. Silvicultural prescriptions that open tree
canopies often increase forage abundance and
diversity (Patton 1974, Masters et al. 1993).
Conversely, restoration treatments may reduce hid-
ing cover for mule deer and alter microclimatic and
physical characteristics of potential bed sites in
treated forests (Germaine 1998).
In addition,
restoration treatments are planned for large areas
(>4,000 ha; Anonymous 2001, United States
Department of Agriculture, Forest Service 2001)
that could preclude use by mule deer if all critical
resource needs are not met within treated areas
(Kufeld et al. 1988).
We examined the response of day-bedding and
foraging female mule deer to forest restoration
treatments in a ponderosa pine forest in north-
western Arizona,during and immediately following
fawning season. We wished to identify important
habitat characteristics of day-bed and forage sites in
an untreated, current-condition ponderosa forest,
then evaluate relative availability of sites having
similar characteristics between untreated and
restoration-treated forest. We expected that if local-
ly characteristic day-bed or forage-site microhabitat
was altered in treated forest, female mule deer
would either alter diurnal use of these areas for one
or both activities or accept sites containing a dif-
ferent suite of characteristics.
To address these
questions, we determined whether mule deer
selected untreated or treated forest for diurnal bed
placement or foraging, and identified habitat char-
acteristics of diurnal bed and forage sites in treated
forest. We define habitat in this paper as the struc-
tural and microclimatic features describing day-
bed, forage, and random sites.
Our objectives were to 1) identify microhabitat
characteristics of used day-beds and forage sites
from the range of features available in untreated
ponderosa pine forest; 2) compare relative avail-
ability of day-bed and forage microhabitat between
untreated and treated forest; 3) determine whether
female mule deer selected either forest type dis-
proportionately for day-bed use or diurnal foraging;
and 4) compare microhabitat characteristics of
used day-beds and forage sites between forest
types.
Study area
We observed bedded and foraging deer within
the Mt. Trumbull Resource Conservation Area
(RCA) on the Arizona Strip,in the southern portion
of the Uinkaret Plateau. Elevation within the study
Mule deer and forest restoration • Germaine et al. 555

area ranged from 1,980–2,448 m. Major vegetative
communities included pure ponderosa pine forest
and ponderosa pine–deciduous forest composed of
Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) and New Mexican
locust (Robinia neomexicana).
Pinyon pine
(Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniperus osteosper-
ma) occurred sporadically throughout the area and
dominated south-facing slopes. Precipitation in the
area was greatest during winter and summer, with
spring and fall being relatively dry. Average mini-
mum and maximum daily temperatures during June
were 14.3oC and 32.1oC, with an average annual
precipitation of 32.9 cm during 1971–2000
(Western Regional Climate Center 2000).
Pioneers settled the area circa 1870. Typical of
much of the American Southwest, commercial log-
ging and livestock grazing began almost immedi-
ately and continue today. Naturally occurring fires
in the Mt.Trumbull area have been suppressed for
much of the past century through removal of flam-
mable ground cover by grazing and through federal
fire-prevention programs (Covington and Moore
1994).
Methods
Restoration prescription
Restoration treatments began in 1996 and were
scheduled for 1,093 ha. The restoration prescrip-
tion applied to the Mt.Trumbull RCA was similar to
that of many proposed projects in the Southwest,
and baseline data were collected by the Ecological
Restoration 
Institute 
at 
Northern 
Arizona
University. They conducted on-site tree-core sam-
pling to develop size–age-class relationships for all
species and searched for all evidences (logs,
stumps, stump holes, living trees) of presettlement
(1870)-aged trees. When found, they replaced non-
living old-growth remnants with 1.5–3 living trees
from within an 18.3-m radius, then marked these
and living presettlement trees for retention. They
replaced each juniper and pinyon pine remnant
with 2 trees within 4.6 m. They did not thin gam-
bel oak and New Mexican locust, and took care to
avoid damaging oak trees during thinning because
of their demonstrated value to wildlife (Reynolds et
al. 1970). They used commercial logging and post-
commercial thinning to remove unmarked trees.
They then burned and reseeded logged sites with a
native herb mix dominated by grasses. In this man-
ner,pre-treatment stand densities (x-=666 trees/ha±
283 SE) were reduced by up to 87%, to densities (x-
=88/ha±48 SE) estimated to approximate preset-
tlement conditions (Covington et al. 1997,
Ecological Restoration Institute, unpublished data).
Data collection
We captured and attached radiotransmitters to
female mule deer throughout the Mt. Trumbull 
RCA between May–September 1997–2000.
Observations of bedded and foraging mule deer
were collected by trained, camouflaged observers
between 0700 and 1800 hours Mountain Standard
Time daily between 27 May–11 September during
1998–2000. We did so because, while deer may
spend >20% of daytime foraging, they remain with-
in or near escape cover during daytime (Kufeld et
al. 1988), and escape cover may be limited in treat-
ed areas. We rotated observation attempts incre-
mentally among all marked mule deer,with no indi-
vidual mule deer observed >1/day. Each observa-
tion was classified as a bedded or foraging deer
only if the doe was seen in or leaving a bed or for-
aging and not disturbed by the observer’s
approach.
Once we observed a target deer, we
approached the focal site quietly, flagged the site,
and permanently recorded the location using a
Trimble® (Sunnyvale, Calif.) GeoExplorer II GPS
receiver. We occasionally accepted random obser-
vations of nontelemetered deer when encountered
en route to a telemetered animal.
Upon documenting a day-bed, we immediately
recorded wind speed (Beaufort scale) and direc-
tion. Temperature (oC) was recorded 2.5 cm into
the bed substrate and also 30 cm above ground
both over the center of the bed and in the nearest
full sun. We also recorded percent cloud cover and
whether the deer had been shaded or sunlit (>80%
sunlit) at time of observation. We then randomly
located a paired site between 0–360o and 25–135
m from the used site, flagged it, and subjected it to
the same measurements within 10 minutes of data
collection at the bed site. The goal of our study was
to compare used and available habitat characteris-
tics on a fine scale of differentiation, so we con-
strained random sites to fall within the same vege-
tative cover type as bed and forage sites.
Within 2 weeks of each observation, we collect-
ed vegetative data from both the bed or forage site
and a random point. We measured slope and aspect
within a 1-m radius of the focal point and also for a
10-m radius about the focal point. We categorized
dominant vegetative cover (mixed conifer, pon-
derosa, pinyon–juniper, meadow, oak, locust) and
556

landform type (drainage bottom, hillside, bench,
ridge top, open flat, or canyon bottom) and noted
whether each site was within untreated or restora-
tion-treated forest. Overstory and midstory canopy
closure were scored as deciduous, coniferous, or
absent at 20 evenly spaced points (2-m intervals) in
the 4 cardinal directions about the focal point.
Height and species of vegetative structure directly
over beds were recorded. We measured ground
cover (%) in 9 categories (grass, log, slash, shrub or
cacti, organic litter, bare, forb, rock, cobble) at 40
points located at 1-m intervals along the 4 cardinal
directions about bed and feed sites. For feed sites,
we also pooled grass,forb,and shrub or cacti into a
category called live ground cover. We used point-
quarter sampling (Smith 1980) to estimate density
of shrubs, trees, and logs, and average shrub height
and log volume at all sites. At feed and feed-random
sites, we also estimated grass patch density, height,
and diameter, and tallied number of grass, forb, and
shrub species present within 3.6 m of the focal
point. At bed sites we tallied total number of trees
by species within a 200-m2 plot with corners ori-
ented along the cardinal directions. Finally,we esti-
mated concealment distance as the average of the
distance (m) at which a sitting person was no
longer visible to a standing observer in each cardi-
nal direction from the bed site.
Data analysis
We developed logistic regression models to iden-
tify the micro-climatic (for beds), forage and topog-
raphy (for feed sites), and habitat structure vari-
ables that best differentiated used from available
sites in untreated forest each year (Objective 1). We
chose candidate predictor variables based on pub-
lished accounts of bed site (Gerlach and Vaughan
1991, Ockenfels and Brooks 1994) and foraging
habitat (Boeker et al. 1972, Currie et al. 1977,
Collins and Urness 1983) and on our own knowl-
edge of our study area. We prescreened candidate
variables via box-plots to eliminate those not differ-
ing between used and random sites from further
consideration (Wilkinson et al. 1996).
Variables
with a high degree of interquartile overlap were
dismissed. We submitted remaining variables to an
iterative, backward-stepwise logistic regression
analysis to identify the model that best differentiat-
ed used bed and forage sites from random sites,
while avoiding over-fitting with irrelevant variables
(Hosmer and Lemeshow 1989, Systat 1999). We
assessed goodness-of-fit of final models by examin-
ing deciles of risk tables and Hosmer-Lemeshow
statistics (Hosmer and Lemeshow 1989, Systat
1999),with alpha set at 0.05 for Hosmer-Lemeshow
tests. We first developed logistic regression models
using data from untreated forest areas to identify
microhabitat characteristics that best distinguished
used from random sites. In this fashion, we used
the logistic regression models as a descriptive tool:
variables included in the best model contributed
most to the classification of sites and therefore
were assumed important to deer in choosing day-
bed and forage sites.
We next compared relative availability of day-bed
and forage microhabitat between the 2 forest treat-
ment types each year using variables retained in
logistic regression models (Objective 2).
We
defined day-bed microhabitat each year as being
within the interquartile range of variability (±25th
percentile around median) for variables describing
used day-beds in untreated forest. We described for-
aging microsites each year as we did for bed sites
(median±25th percentiles) for all biotic nonforage
variables at forage sites in untreated forest. We then
evaluated percent of randomly sampled microsites
in each forest type that were similar to used sites in
untreated forest. To be deemed suitable, a forage
microsite must have had > the median value of
potential forage items (forbs, grasses, shrubs) and
also have been within the interquartile range of
nonforage variables. We then determined percent
of randomly sampled sites in each forest type for
which values of all variables simultaneously met the
criteria for bed and forage sites. To maximize sam-
ple size for comparisons of forage microsite avail-
ability, we included 14 foraging observations from
uncollared does in 1998, 6 in 1999, and 7 in 2000,
all of which were encountered while radiotracking
collared animals.
We determined whether the distribution of used
day-bed and forage sites was proportionally similar
to area of untreated and treated forest available
each year (Objective 3). We generated minimum
convex polygons (mcp) describing each mule
deer’s summer home range and overlayed them on
GIS maps of treatment status of the study area each
year to identify deer that had both forest types
available within home ranges. We pooled locations
of these deer to develop a master mcp, within
which we summed area of both forest types and tal-
lied bed and forage-site locations between forest
types (Thomas and Taylor 1990). We then com-
pared the proportion of observed bed and forage
Mule deer and forest restoration • Germaine et al. 557

sites in each forest type to binomial 90% confi-
dence intervals (Zar 1996) on expected propor-
tions to determine whether selection for or against
each forest type was being demonstrated.
We next contrasted characteristics of used bed
and forage sites between forest types (Objective 4).
For bed sites we considered variables retained in
logistic regression models in >1 year most impor-
tant and determined whether they varied between
forest types using Mann-Whitney (M-W) tests (Zar
1996).
Forbs provide high-quality nutrition for
female mule deer during the summer fawning sea-
son, while browse is nutritionally sufficient and
grasses are of less value (Smith 1952, Boeker et al.
1972, Collins and Urness 1983). We therefore used
number of species and percent ground covered by
forbs and shrubs to characterize forage microsites
and tested for differences between forest types in
Mann-Whitney tests (Zar 1996). Finally, to identify
how used bed sites differed most between forest
types, we developed new logistic regression mod-
els to identify variables that best differentiated used
sites between forest types. To increase sample size
for model-building, we considered habitat treated
when tree removal had occurred, whether an area
had been burned or not. Forage-site sample sizes
were too small to model in this manner.
Results
Forty-three ha were treated by 1998, 84 ha had
been treated by 1999, and 203 ha had been treated
by 2000, including doubling the size of an area
treated earlier.
We collected bed-site data from
treated units and 1,500 ha of untreated forest sur-
rounding them. Treatments ranged from 1–4 years
post-treatment age during our study.
We described day-bed microhabitat characteris-
tics at 117 sites in 1998,60 sites in 1999,59 sites in
2000, and an equal number of random sites each
year. We measured habitat characteristics at 74 for-
aging microsites in 1998, 39 sites in 1999, and 39
sites in 2000,and from 203 random sites during this
period.
We collected data from 19 telemetered
deer: 13, 12, and 13 deer each year, respectively.
Individual deer contributed between 1 and 14% of
the observations obtained each year.
In untreated forest in 1998, day-bed sites had
lower soil temperatures and percent ground cov-
ered by forbs and higher shrub height and midsto-
ry canopy cover than random sites (Figure 1a). The
logistic regression model was significant (log-likeli-
hood = 33.76; χ2 P < 0.001), and classified 59.8%
(used=60.0%, random=59.5%) of all sites correctly.
The model provided an acceptable fit to the data
(Hosmer-Lemeshow P=0.187).
Used day-beds in
untreated forest in 1999 were best predicted by
lower soil temperature in beds, lower air tempera-
ture 30 cm above beds,and lower overstory canopy
closure over beds than at random sites (Figure 1b).
This model was significant (log-likelihood=17.63;
χ2 P=0.001),classified 59.0% (used=61.1%,random
=56.7%) of all sites correctly and fit the data well
(Hosmer-Lemeshow P=0.469). We retained 2 vari-
ables in the model that best classified day-bed sites
in untreated forest in 2000.
Used day-bed sites
were best described by higher percent ground cov-
ered by organic litter and lower air temperature 30
cm above beds than found at random sites (Figure
1c).
The model was significant (log-likelihood =
11.66; χ2 P=0.003), classified 55.4% (used=56.7%,
random=54.1%) of all sites correctly and fit the
data well (Hosmer-Lemeshow P=0.620).
Forage sites in untreated forest in 1998 were
characterized by higher numbers of forb species,
trees/ha, and acorn presence than random sites
(Figure 2a). The logistic regression model was sig-
nificant (log-likelihood=17.42; χ2 P=0.001), classi-
fied 57.9% (used = 52.4%, random = 62.3%) of all
sites correctly and provided an acceptable fit to the
data (Hosmer-Lemeshow P=0.535). Forage sites in
untreated forest in 1999 were best distinguished
from random sites by having greater deciduous
midstory canopy closure and being on microsites
oriented in a southeasterly aspect, while random
microsites tended to be oriented northeasterly
(Figure 2b). The logistic regression model was sig-
nificant (log-likelihood = 11.72; χ2 P = 0.003) and
classified 58.6% (used=51.3%, random=64.0%) of
all sites correctly. The model fit the data (Hosmer-
Lemeshow P=0.884).
In 2000 3 variables were
retained in the model that best classified diurnal
forage sites in untreated forest. Forage sites were
best described by greater deciduous midstory
canopy cover, live ground cover, and number of
grass species than random sites (Figure 2c). The
model was significant (log-likelihood=22.70; χ2 P<
0.001), classified 61.7% (used = 58.9%, random =
64.1%) of all sites correctly and fit the data
(Hosmer-Lemeshow P=0.736).
Availability of day-bed microhabitat was restrict-
ed in treated forest compared to untreated forest in
all 3 years.
In untreated forest suitable day-bed
microhabitat was present in 14.0% (n=86), 17.6%

(n=51),and 17.0% (n=53) of all random plots sam-
pled during 1998–2000,respectively. In treated for-
est suitable day-bed microhabitat was present at
6.5% of random sites sampled in 1998 (n=31),none
in 1999 (n=19), and 8.3% in 2000 (n=12), consti-
tuting a 54%, 100%, and 51% reduction in availabili-
ty of sites having the characteristics of used beds in
untreated forest each year, respectively.
Conversely, forage microsite availability was
greater in treated forest than in untreated forest in
all years. In 1998 forage microsites contained >3
forb species and between 152–1,130 trees/ha.
Forage microsites in 1999 had 1–58% deciduous
midstory canopy cover, while microsites in 2000
had 1–41% deciduous midstory canopy cover,
8–28% live ground cover, and >1.5 grass species
present. In untreated forest,forage microsites were
present at 17.2% (n=64), 38.1% (n=42), and 10.6%
(n=47) of all randomly sampled microsites in each
year, respectively. In treated forest, 28.6% of sites
sampled in 1998 were suitable microforage sites (n
=35), 50.0% were in 1999 (n=10), and 16.7% were
in 2000 (n=6). Thus, forage microsite availability
increased in treated forest by 66%, 31%, and 58%
each year, respectively.
Despite reduced availability of bed-site micro-
habitat in treated forest, frequencies of occurrence
of mule deer day-beds between forest types did not
differ from that expected based on area of each for-
est type available each year (Table 1), indicating
that a comparison of microsite features at used
beds between the 2 forest types was warranted.
Similarly, despite increased forage microsite avail-
ability in treated forest in all years and increased
forb abundance and species richness in1998, mule
deer did not demonstrate selection for either forest
type while foraging in 1998 or 2000. However, in
1999 foraging mule deer selected treated forest and
avoided untreated forest (Table 1).
Regression models retained 3 variables describ-
ing day-bed sites in untreated forest in >1 year, and
we compared these variables between forest types
for years they loaded into models. Midstory canopy
cover did not differ between forest types in either
1998 or 1999 (M-W U=1182.5, P=0.55; M-W U=
188.5, P = 0.95), respectively (see Figure 1 for
untreated forest value), nor did ambient tempera-
ture at beds (M-W U=112.0, P=0.80; M-W U=68.5,
P=0.69) in 1999 or 2000, respectively. However, in
2000 ambient temperature was recorded in only 3
beds in treated forest. Soil temperature in beds did
not differ in 1998 (M-W U=1168.0, P=0.67) but
averaged  4oC higher in beds in treated forest in
1999 (M-W U=153.0, P=0.06).
The model that best discriminated used day-beds
between forest types in 1998 contained 4 variables.
Average concealment distance, live ground cover,
and number of oak trees were greater, while per-
cent ground covered by organic litter was lower at
beds in treated forest than those in untreated forest
(Figure 3a). This model was significant (log-likeli-
hood = 57.20; χ2 P < 0.001) and classified 80.6%
(60.8% untreated, 87.1% treated) of all sites cor-
rectly. The model fit the data (Hosmer-Lemeshow P
=0.124). Location of used day-beds in 1999 was
best predicted by higher concealment distance,
number of oak trees, number of all trees, and by
lower percent coniferous midstory canopy at beds
in treated forest than at those in untreated forest
(Figure 3b). The model was significant (log-likeli-
hood = 16.64; χ2 P < 0.003), correctly predicted
85.3% (37.2% treated, 91.7% untreated) of all sites
correctly, and satisfied fit-to-data requirements

(oak), both of which loaded into models in 1998
and 1999, were higher at day-beds in treated forest
(cd=30.3 m,oak=36) than in untreated forest (cd=
23.6 m, oak=1; Figure 3c).
Characteristics of forage at microsites increased
in treated forest relative to untreated forest in 1998
but not 1999,with number of observations in treat-
ed forest too small to test in 2000. In 1998 median
number of forb species (M-W U=827.5, P=0.008)
and percent ground covered by forbs (M-W U =
791.0, P=0.023) were greater in treated forest. In
1999 neither forb variable differed, and number of
shrub species was higher at forage sites in untreat-
ed forest than in treated forest (M-W U=49.0, P=
0.036).
Discussion
Bed-site temperature and canopy closure had the
most influence on bed placement in untreated,cur-
rent-condition forest. Used beds were cooler than
random sites in all years, while canopy closure
loaded into models in 2 years. In 1998 midstory
canopy cover at bed sites was higher than at ran-
dom sites. In 1999 overstory canopy was lower at
bed sites. However, an inverse relationship existed
between overstory and midstory canopy, and we
found midstory canopy significantly higher at used
beds (M-W U=0.044), despite not loading in the
1999 model.
Mule deer select day-beds to assist thermoregula-
tion (Lindsdale and Tomich 1953, Short 1981) and
to avoid predation (Geist 1981, Gerlach and
Vaughan 1991). Gerlach and Vaughan (1991) found
that mule deer fawn bed sites in southwestern
Colorado had greater concealment cover, canopy
closure, and abundance of shrubs and grasses than
random sites. Ockenfels and Brooks (1994) found
that day-bed sites of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginianus) in southeastern Arizona had lower air
and soil temperatures and higher canopy closure
than random sites. High tree densities common in
our untreated study area increased bed conceal-
ment, and selecting sites to aid thermoregulation
appeared a higher priority for deer in untreated for-
est.
Diurnal forage sites likely were chosen within
concealment and thermoregulation constraints.
This may result in less optimal sites foraged in day-
time than at night and may have affected each
model’s ability to classify forage micro-sites in
untreated forest.
Nonetheless, increased forage

availability at used sites loaded into models in 2 of 3
years.
In addition, percent deciduous midstory
canopy was greater at used forage sites in 2 years.
Percent ground covered by forbs, grass, live ground
cover, and number of forb species were significantly
greater at sites having >median value of deciduous
midstory canopy cover in both years, and we con-
clude deer were selecting for these characteristics.
In treated forest relative availability of suitable
day-bed microhabitat was reduced by 50–100%,
while availability of foraging microhabitat was
30–60% higher than in untreated forest. Deer did
not avoid treated forest for day-bed use, demon-
strating sufficient behavioral plasticity to utilize
novel microhabitat conditions in treated forest.
Whether there is long-term cost or benefit associat-
ed with bedding in restoration-treated forest needs
to be investigated.
Deer that continued to bed in treated forest
experienced warmer bed-site temperatures than
those in untreated forest. Soil temperature was up
to 4oC warmer in beds in treated forest,and this dif-
ference may increase thermoregulatory stress for
deer and fawns during summer (Parker and
Gillingham 1990). In all years ambient daytime air
temperatures were >25oC, a temperature above
which deer may experience thermoregulatory
stress during summer (Parker and Robbins 1984),
and in 2 years ambient air temperatures in treated
forest were >1oC warmer than in untreated forest.
Whereas thresholds of concealment distance are
not static, we found they averaged 25% greater in
treated forest. This resulted from the type and size
of remnant tree stands retained in treated areas.
Conifers were the primary cover type at beds in
untreated forest, but almost all beds in treated for-
est were under small oak stands. Oak stands afford-
ed the only remaining patches of midstory canopy
in treated forest and as such were the primary fac-
tor in shading treated forest day-beds. However,oak
stands were poor at concealing bed sites.
Understory regeneration may eventually increase
bed concealment in treated areas, but regeneration
is slow in the Southwest. In contrast, coniferous
tree boles and limbs contributed most to conceal-
ing bedded mule deer in untreated forest,and Smith
et al. (1986) reported that mule deer appeared to
prefer bedding in association with coniferous trees.
Forb abundance and species richness were higher
in treated forest in 1998 and similar between forest
types in 1999. Forbs are important to does during
reproduction and lactation due to their high mois-
ture content, digestibility, and nutrient levels (Smith
1952, Boeker et al. 1972, Main and Coblentz 1996),
and Dietz and Nagy (1976) reported that forbs
become a nutritionally important food item in sum-
mer for both does and fawns. We did not evaluate
nutritional value of forbs,but assumed that increased
species richness equated to increased forage quality.
Forage productivity increased in other areas where
forest canopy had been reduced (Currie et al. 1977,
Kufeld et al.1988),and Patton (1974) and Collins and
Urness (1983) reported increased use of such areas
by mule deer. Given increased forage availability in
restoration-treated forest, we expected female mule
deer to select these areas for diurnal foraging. In
1999 they did so but not in 1998 or 2000.
Kufeld et al. (1989) determined that >60% of
home ranges were escape cover. At <5 years post-
treatment,hiding was reduced well below this level
in treated forest. Kufeld et al. (1988) found that
while mule deer fed in large open areas at night,
they avoided these areas during daytime. Boeker et
al.(1972) found positive correlations between avail-
ability and consumption of forage items, but deer
must not only maximize energy intake, they must
avoid predators and successfully reproduce (King
and Smith 1980, Kie et al. 1991).
Management implications
Restoring the grand forests of the 1800s probably
is not possible due to changes in human populations,
global climate, demands for forest products, invasive
exotic flora, and numerous other factors (reviewed
by Wagner et al. 2000), but improving forest health
and primary productivity while reducing catastroph-
ic fire risk are. At the same time, single-species man-
agement generally is outdated (Carpenter 1998), and
societal expectations for recreational opportunities
involving mule deer and other big game need to be
properly put in the larger context of landscape ecol-
ogy and ecosystem health. Forest restoration pre-
scriptions that retain critical habitat components of
locally important or imperiled wildlife hold the best
promise for improving forest health while retaining
or increasing local biodiversity.
Benefit of forest restoration to female mule deer
will depend both on herbaceous recovery and
retention of bed and escape cover (Griffith and
Peek 1989,Kufeld et al.1989). Fire-return intervals,
domestic grazing pressure, and microsite features
such as soils, exposure, aspect, and moisture will
dictate the extent to which forbs and shrubs suc-

ceed in treated areas. As treated areas become large
enough to incorporate entire home ranges, it is
unclear how mule deer reproductive success, sur-
vival, or distribution in these areas will be affected
by changes in bed-site temperatures and conceal-
ment.
It is imperative that this question be
addressed before restoration treatments are applied
across large forest expanses. Juxtaposing both for-
est types and retaining dense patches of untreated
forest within treated areas may be necessary if use
by mule deer is a management goal.
We expect forage and day-bed microhabitat will
respond similarly in other ponderosa pine forests of
the southwestern United States receiving similar
treatment prescriptions. Therefore,we recommend
that stands of sapling and pole-sized trees having
>40% midstory canopy closure be retained in treat-
ed forest. Deer day-bedded in stands as small as
0.02–0.04 ha in our study but were less concealed;
we therefore recommend retaining stands >0.04 ha
in size and retaining deciduous and coniferous
trees to meet both foraging and concealment
needs. Retaining conifers that have low branches
will further enhance concealment. Forage quality
and quantity both increased in treated forest areas,
and if treatment prescriptions are adapted to
increase retention of hiding and bedding cover, the
goals of both forest restoration and mule deer man-
agement will be better served.
