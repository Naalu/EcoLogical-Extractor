1. Introduction
After a century of ﬁre suppression, conifer forests in the
western United States have dramatically departed from condi-
tions that existed prior to Euro-American settlement (Covington
and Moore, 1994; Taylor and Skinner, 1998; Fry and Stephens,
2006). With the resulting dense forest conditions and heavy
fuel loads, wildﬁres are increasing in frequency and severity
(Covington, 2000). To reduce this threat and the decline in
ecosystem health in frequent ﬁre forests, land managers are
devising landscape-scale restoration treatments that would
reestablish open forest conditions and allow frequent ﬁre to
safely return to its role in regulating tree density and fuel
accumulation (Sisk et al., 2005; Noss et
al., 2006b). A key
assumption in designing landscape-scale treatments is that by
strategically locating burning, thinning, and other silvicultural
treatments, fuel continuity can be disrupted, allowing managed
wildﬁres to burn the balance of the area (Finney, 2001; Agee and
Skinner, 2005). A necessary step in designing and evaluating these
treatments is understanding the ecological effects of silvicultural
and ﬁre management treatments on wildlife.

After a century of ﬁre suppression, conifer forests in the western United States have dramatically
departed from conditions that existed prior to Euro-American settlement, with heavy fuel loads and an
increased incidence of wildﬁre. To reduce this threat and improve overall forest health, land managers
are designing landscape-scale treatments that strategically locate thinning and burning treatments to
disrupt fuel continuity, allowing managed wildﬁres to burn the remaining area. A necessary step in
designing and evaluating these treatments is understanding their ecological effects on wildlife. We used
meta-analysis to compare effects of small-diameter removal (thinnings and shelterwoods) and burning
treatments, selective harvesting, overstory removal (including clearcutting), and wildﬁre on wildlife
species in southwestern conifer forests. We hypothesized that small-diameter removal and burning
treatments would have minimal effects on wildlife compared to other treatments. We found 33 studies
that met our criteria by (1) comparing density or reproductive output for wildlife species, (2) using forest
management or wildﬁre treatments, (3) implementing control-impact or before-after control-impact
design using unmanaged stands as controls, and (4) occurring in Arizona or New Mexico ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa) or mixed conifer (Abies/Picea/Pinus) forest. The 22 studies suitable for meta-analysis
occurred 20 years post-treatment on sites <400 ha. Small-diameter harvest and burning treatments
had positive effects but thin/burn and selective harvest treatments had no detectable effect on most
small mammals and passerine bird species reported in studies; overstory removal and wildﬁre resulted
in an overall negative response. We examined foraging guild responses to treatments; ground-foraging
birds and rodents had no strong response. Aerial-, tree-, and bole-foraging birds had positive or neutral
responses to the small-diameter removal and burning treatments, but negative responses to overstory
removal and wildﬁre. Small-diameter removal and burning treatments as currently being implemented
in the Southwest do not negatively impact most of the wildlife species in the studies we examined in the
short-term (10 years). We believe a combination of treatments in a patchy arrangement across the
landscape will result in the highest diversity and density. We recommend that managers implement
thinning and burning treatments, but that future research efforts focus on long-term responses of
species at larger spatial scales, use reproductive output as a more informative response variable, and
target species for which there is a paucity of data.

Wildlife responses to forest treatments vary widely; generally, it
isassumedthattreatmentswhichrestoreconditions consistentwith
those they have experienced over evolutionary time will have more
beneﬁcial effects than treatments that create novel conditions
(Soule, 1985; Noss and Csuti, 1994; Lindenmayer and Franklin,
2002). High severity disturbances such as clearcutting and wildﬁre
(Anthony and Isaacs, 1989; Grialou et al., 2000; Cunningham et al.,
2002) and unnaturally dense or open conditions (Brown and Davis,
1998; Shick et
al., 2006) can have negative impacts on animal
species, particularly in the short-term, because of habitat alteration.
Thinning and burning treatments are an effort to return forest
structure and composition to within the range of natural variability,
which should beneﬁt native wildlife species (Allen et al., 2002).
Southwestern conifer forests of the United States are an ideal
system for examining the effects of forest treatments on wildlife,
due
to
historical
and
current
approaches
to
management.
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and mixed conifer (Abies
lasiocarpa, P. ﬂexilis, P. ponderosa, Populus tremuloides, Pseudotsuga
menziesii) forests cover >3 million ha in the southwestern United
States (US Department of Agriculture Forest Service, 2009). Due to
historical logging and silvicultural practices, ﬁre suppression, and
grazing, most frequent ﬁre forests in the Southwest are now
characterized by excessive tree densities, low diversity of plant and
wildlife species, and high susceptibility to stand-replacing crown
ﬁres (Covington et al., 1994; Fule´ et al., 1997; Cocke et al., 2005).
There is now an emphasis on restoring forests to past conditions
using thinning and prescribed ﬁre (Healthy Forests Restoration
Act, 2003). These treatments may have negative, short-term effects
on wildlife species that do not tolerate disturbance well, or that
depend on these structures for nesting or foraging (Bock and Bock,
1983; Chambers and Germaine, 2003; Converse et al., 2006).
However, in the long-term treatments should create forest
structures with reduced tree densities and an open, patchy
structure of mostly mature trees with herbaceous ground cover
maintained by a frequent ﬁre regime (Waltz et al., 2003; Moore et
al., 2006). The increase in spatial and temporal heterogeneity
should diversify habitat available for wildlife, and, in turn, restore a
native, diverse assemblage of animal species (Allen et al., 2002;
Noss et al., 2006a).
No consensus exists regarding wildlife responses to forest
management in the Southwest. Studies of wildlife responses to
thinning and burning treatments vary widely in species studied,
response variable (e.g., density, abundance) measured, treatment
(e.g., thinning, burning) examined, and temporal and spatial extent
of the study design. Existing reviews include summaries of impacts
of thinning and burning treatments on birds (Block and Finch,
1997; Sallabanks et
al., 2000; Bock and Block, 2005a,b) and
qualitative reviews that described effects of thinning and ﬁre on
multiple wildlife species (Lyon et
al., 2000; Chambers and
Germaine, 2003; Pilliod and Bull, 2006). A recent meta-analysis
examined the impacts of forest treatments on small mammals in
North American forests, but focused on clearcutting as a manage-
ment tool (Zwolak, 2009). No review quantitatively examined
effects of forest treatments on multiple wildlife species.
To design landscape-scale restoration treatments, managers
need to understand what is known about wildlife impacts of
treatments that might be used: thinning, prescribed burns,
wildﬁre, and clearcut fuel breaks. The purpose of this study was
to synthesize and analyze studies of treatment impacts on wildlife
in ponderosa pine and mixed conifer forests in the southwestern
United States. We used both qualitative and quantitative (meta-
analysis) techniques. Meta-analysis is an analytical technique used
to quantitatively summarize the results of multiple studies by
calculating an effect size which compares a response variable
between a treatment and control for each study, and then
calculates a mean effect size across studies (Hedges and Olkin,
1985; Gurevitch and Hedges, 1993). We used meta-analysis to
assess treatment impacts for vertebrate wildlife species whose
density or reproductive output were compared in treated versus
untreated forest sites in southwestern forests. Our objectives were
to (1) determine which treatments had the greatest effect on
wildlife, hypothesizing that thinning and burning treatments, if
not eliciting a positive response from wildlife, may have less of a
negative impact than clearcutting, selective harvesting, or high
severity wildﬁre, particularly in the short-term; (2) determine
which species were most and least sensitive to habitat manipula-
tion; and (3) identify species or groups of species for which there
was a paucity of ﬁeld experimentation and data. This analysis
serves as a starting point for researchers and resource managers in
designing testable hypotheses about impacts of thinning and
burning treatments on wildlife, and determining future monitor-
ing and research needs.
2. Methods
2.1. Data selection and extraction
We searched the following databases between September and
December 2008: Academic Search Premier, Biological Sciences,
BioOne, Environmental Science and Pollution Management, Plant
Science, Springer Link, Wiley Interscience, Zoological Record,
JSTOR, Forest Science Database, Dissertation and Theses Full Text.
We used all combinations of the terms: wildlife, birds, reptiles,
amphibians, mammals AND western forest, ponderosa pine AND
restoration, thinning, logging, clearcut, prescribed burn, treatment,
fuels reduction, ﬁre. Peer-reviewed papers, conference proceed-
ings, government documents, and theses were considered during
our search. We also searched online government and institutional
libraries including U.S. Forest Service TreeSearch (treesearch.fs.fe-
d.us), Ecological Restoration Institute library at Northern Arizona
University (library.eri.nau.edu), and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
website (library.fws.gov). We spoke to wildlife biologists, public
agency personnel, academicians, and authors to obtain additional
sources and unpublished studies.
We selected studies that met these 4 criteria:
1. Vertebrate species were compared in terms of either of two
response variables: (a) density or (b) reproductive output, as
deﬁned by number of successful nests, number of offspring, and/
or survival rates of offspring;
2. Treatment was forest harvesting, including thinning, shelter-
wood, selective harvesting, and clearcutting, and/or burning,
including prescribed ﬁre and wildﬁre;
3. Study design was control-impact (CI) or before-after control-
impact (BACI) with a control for comparison (i.e., an unmanaged
stand);
4. Study was conducted in the southwestern United States
(Arizona or New Mexico) in ponderosa pine or mixed conifer
forest.
With the ﬁnal set of studies, we built a database to record the
relevant information. In addition to recording species and their
density and reproductive output information, we noted site
characteristics that could affect the response, and included these
variables as covariates (treatment, time since treatment, and forest
type including mixed conifer or ponderosa pine). As treatments
were not always deﬁned in silvicultural terms, for the purposes of
this analysis we broadly categorized studies into 6 treatments:
1. ‘‘Small-diameter removal,’’ where small-to-intermediate dia-
meter trees were removed, including both thinning and
shelterwood treatments;
E.L. Kalies et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 259 (2010) 333–342
334

2. ‘‘Burning,’’ or low-to-moderate severity burns which were
generally prescribed ﬁres with ﬁre-charring roughly 0–1.5 m
above the ground and only a few trees were killed in the
understory;
3. ‘‘Thin/burn,’’ where a thinning was conducted followed by a
low-to-moderate severity prescribed burn;
4. ‘‘Selective harvest,’’ where trees, typically of large-diameter,
were selectively removed;
5. ‘‘Overstory removal,’’ which represents the most intensive
treatments, including clearcuts, where >80% of the basal area
was removed; and
6. ‘‘Wildﬁre,’’ deﬁned as high severity burns or stand-replacing
wildﬁre where ﬁre charring was greater than 1.5 m above the
ground, almost all the understory was killed, and some to all
large trees were killed.
Data were separated by year and site whenever possible. We
noted methodological variables that we hypothesized could affect
the outcome of the study, including study design (BACI or CI), area
sampled, density estimation method (relative density or true
density incorporating detection probability), replication, quality of
study (peer reviewed or not), and study (identifying the origin of
the data). We were unable to account for the season of sampling as
a covariate because some studies reported only one density
estimate based on a full year of sampling; thus, data from all
seasons are pooled.
2.2. Meta-analysis
The most commonly used effect sizes in meta-analyses (i.e.,
Hedges’ d, Cohen’s d) are calculated based on sample size and
variance, assuming that studies with large sample sizes and
smaller variances are more reliable (Hedges and Olkin, 1985;
Rosenberg et al., 2000). However many wildlife studies are not
replicated so there is no variance across replicates, nor do many
studies report a variance. Often the number of replicates is not an
adequate measure of sampling effort because it does not take into
account the size of the site. Thus, we used a response ratio as our
effect size calculation, deﬁned as ln(treatment mean/control
mean) (Hedges et
al., 1999). This metric has become more
commonly used in meta-analysis (Mosquera et al., 2000; Coˆte´ et
al., 2001) as it is designed to measure relative differences (often
appropriate in ecological studies) and behaves better statistically
(Hedges et al., 1999). Since a response ratio cannot be calculated
when a treatment or control mean is equal to zero, we performed
trials where we added 1, 0.1, 0.001, 0.0001, and 0.00001 to each
treatment and control mean before calculating the response ratio
(Molloy et
al., 2008). We determined that using 0.001 had the
smallest impact on the overall (average) effect size.
Effect sizes are usually weighted by the inverse of the sample
variance, in order to account for variation between studies in
sampling effort. With the wildlife studies we examined, the
standard deviation between replicate means is often not (1)
reported, (2) available because sample size is one, or (3) mean-
ingful because the size of a replicate varies dramatically from study
to study. We used a biologically meaningful weighting scheme
where each effect size was weighted by the area sampled (number
of plots  plot size) (Mosquera et al., 2000). We also conducted
unweighted analyses, as these types of analyses did not differ from
traditional weighted analyses (Gardner et al., 2003), produced a
more accurate estimate of overall effect size, and reduced Type 1
error (Lajeunesse and Forbes, 2003; Marczak et al., 2007).
We built generalized linear models to examine relationships
between effect sizes and covariates. We chose 8 models a priori,
hypothesizing that either ecological or methodological variables,
in addition to study, would explain effect size in response to
treatment (Table 1). We based these hypotheses on our review of
the literature and experience with southwestern forest wildlife
studies. We compared models using Akaike’s Information Criterion
adjusted for small sample sizes (AICc) to assess the overall strength
of each model (Burnham and Anderson, 2002). We ranked the
models from highest to lowest according to their DAICc values, and
chose those models with DAICc <2 as the ﬁnal set to be used for
inference (Burnham and Anderson, 2002). We calculated the
Akaike weight (wi) for each candidate model as a measure of model
support and selection uncertainty. We performed the model
selection analysis separately for weighted (using the total area
sampled) and unweighted generalized linear models, and did not
detect a difference in the results.
We examined each of the important covariates in the models, as
identiﬁed by model selection, using Metawin software (v.2,
Rosenberg et
al., 2000). For categorical variables with 2
observations, we calculated a mean effect size (MES) with
conﬁdence intervals generated by bootstrapping (Adams et
al.,
1997), corrected for bias for unequal distribution around the mean.
Effect sizes were considered to be different from zero when the
conﬁdence interval did not include zero. An effect size of zero,
positive, or negative indicated no change between treatment and
control, an increase in the response variable compared to the
control, or a decrease in the response variable, respectively
(Rosenberg et al., 2000). For continuous variables, we regressed
effect size against the variable and reported the associated slope,
which indicates the direction and magnitude of the relationship.
We compared unweighted and weighted analyses, found they
produced similar results, thus we report only unweighted results.
2.3. Publication bias and non-independence of data
Publication bias in meta-analysis occurs because studies with
signiﬁcant results are more likely to be published than those
without signiﬁcant results (Arnqvist and Wooster, 1995). We
minimized bias by limiting the geographic extent of our study area

to the Southwest which allowed us to be very complete in our data
collection. Most of the studies we used examined multiple (3)
species that showed a range of responses, and thus species with no
response to treatment are reported.
We controlled for the problem of lack of independence in data
(i.e., multiple effect sizes can be calculated from the same study
using the same control for multiple treatments; a study of 5 bird
species in 3 types of treatments over 2 years would generate 30
effect sizes) by including a covariate to identify the origin of the
data (study), which was an indicator variable to identify each study
uniquely. This approach allowed us to analyze the relative
importance of ‘‘study’’ compared to the other covariates in our
model selection approach.
3. Results
3.1. Overall results
Of 6908 papers found during our key word literature search, we
identiﬁed 33 studies that met our criteria. Only 25 studies were
usable in our meta-analysis which uses density as the response
variable (Appendix
A). We then eliminated all species with <5
observations across all studies in order to increase our overall
sample size relative to the number of species (n = 1095 observa-
tions, 22 studies). Because there were only 8 studies that used
reproductive output as a response variable, which is insufﬁcient for
meta-analysis, we considered these data qualitatively. The wildlife
species we examined were limited by the data we obtained; not all
species or taxa were equally or well represented (e.g., birds were
more studied than other taxa), and most studies were of a limited
temporal and spatial scale (20 years post-treatment on sites
<400 ha).
The model (DAICc < 2) that best predicted wildlife response to
treatments included the variables treatment, species, time since
treatment, and study (Table 1). Other models performed poorly in
comparison (DAICc  3.11) and included the variables forest type,
study design, method of density estimation, replication and peer-
review status (Table 1).
3.2. Treatment
The mean effect size differed among treatment types; small-
diameter removal and burning treatments had positive effects on
densities but the thin/burn and selective harvest treatments did
not differ from zero (Fig.
1a). Species responded negatively to
overstory removal and wildﬁre (Fig. 1a). We included all species to
show the results based on the information currently available
(species listed in Table 2) and also calculated mean effect sizes for
11 species for which there were data for every treatment (species
listed in Table
2). The responses to treatments were similar to
those for all species combined; however, species responded more
positively to selective harvest and less positively to burning,
relative to the other treatments (Fig. 1b).
3.3. Species
Species varied in their response to the treatments relative to the
controls (Table
2), with some species showing strong responses
(MES >5 or <5 and conﬁdence interval does not overlap 0). Two
species (house wren (Troglodytes aedon)) and red-faced warbler
(Cardellina rubrifrons)) showed strong negative responses to the
small-diameter removal treatments compared to the controls, and 1
species (American robin (Turdus migratorius)) had a strong positive
response. Two species (western wood-pewee (Contopus sordidulus))
andspottedtowhee(Pipilomaculates))demonstratedstrongpositive
responses to the burning treatments relative to the controls (Table
2). Two species exhibited strong negative responses (hermit thrush
(Catharus guttatus)) and red-faced warbler) and 3 strong positive
responses (American robin, western wood-pewee, and rock wren
(Salpinctes obsoletus)) in the selective harvest compared to the
controls. In contrast, there were 10 species that responded strongly
negatively and 3 that responded strongly positively to the overstory
removal, and 12 that responded strongly negatively and 8 that
responded strongly positively to the wildﬁre. Mean effect sizes for
species calculated across the small-diameter removal, burning, and
thin/burn treatments indicated an overall positive response to
treatment (MES = 0.5; CI = 0.3–0.8). The overall response of species
to overstory removal and wildﬁre was negative (MES = 2.6;
CI = 3.1 to 2.0).

treatments, woodpeckers and hummingbirds only exhibited a
negative density response to overstory removal. Data were limited
for raptors (with only 5 observations for American kestrels (Falco
sparverius)) which responded positively to wildﬁre, and tree
squirrels, which responded neutrally to small-diameter removal.
3.4. Time since treatment
Time since treatment across all studies ranged from 1 to 20
years. Time since treatment had an overall negative effect on
species density responses (slope = 0.4); however, this response
was driven largely by the overstory removal (slope = 1.0), since
burning had a positive response (slope = 0.03) and the other four
treatments
negative
(slope:
wildﬁre = 0.1,

har-
vest = 0.2,

For guilds with 4 years of data, the mean effect sizes across
the small-diameter removal, burning, and thin/burn treatments by
year demonstrated that some animals responded positively over
time (ground-foraging birds, woodpeckers), but others negatively
(tree- and bole-foraging birds; Fig. 3). The longest data set that

responded increasingly positively over time (Fig. 3).
3.5. Study
The presence of study as a variable in our top model (Table 1)
indicated a lack of independence between observations from the
same study. We interpreted this as a site effect, as most
observations from the same study also used the same study site.
3.6. Reproductive output
Only 8 studies examined reproductive output of animal species
in treated versus control sites. Six studies focused on bird
responses to treatment (1 on wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo),
1 on Mexican spotted owls (Strix occidentalis lucida), 4 on western
bluebirds (Sialia mexicana)) and 2 studies examined mammal
responses (tassel-eared squirrel, black bear (Ursus americanus)).
Wakeling et al. (1998) found that successful wild turkey nests,
deﬁned by the hatching of at least one egg, were associated with
greater overstory conifer density and time periods longer than 20
years since selective harvest. Battin (2003) found an increase in
ﬂedging success for plumbeous vireos (Vireo plumbeus) and
western tanagers (Piranga ludoviciana) within 4 years of treatment
in thin/burn versus untreated areas. Germaine and Germaine
(2002) found thinning and burning treatments had little effect on
the number of eggs or nestlings per nest of western bluebirds
within 5 years of treatment, but were associated with a higher
number of ﬂedglings per nest and greater probability of ﬂedging at
least one young compared to controls. They also found a higher
incidence of parasitic infestations by blowﬂies in nests in thin/burn
treatments compared to controls (Germaine and Germaine, 2002).
Wightman and Germaine (2006) found that successful western
bluebird nests, determined by number of young in the nest on the
last day prior to ﬂedge, were associated with increased understory
and bare ground and lower conifer tree densities found in thinned
and burned treatments 7 years post-treatment. Hurteau et al. (in
press) show that although nest density for western bluebirds was
signiﬁcantly higher in thinned, burned, and thin/burn treatments
versus controls, the number of eggs or nestlings was not
signiﬁcantly different 2–3 years post-treatment. Jenness et
al.
(2004) found that occupancy and reproduction of Mexican spotted

owls, based on sighting of young outside the nest, was higher in
unburned versus burned treatments within 4 years of treatment,
but the relationship was weak and possibly confounded by the
large range in burn severity in the burned sites.
Dodd et
al. (2006) found that density, adult survival, and
juvenile recruitment, in terms of juveniles/ha, of tassel-eared
squirrels was lower in shelterwood treatments versus controls
approximately 10 years after treatment. In a 4-year study
beginning 1 year after a high-severity wildﬁre, Cunningham
et al. (2003) demonstrated that bear densities remained the same
before and after ﬁre, and in the burned area versus control;
however, the sex ratio in the burned area was skewed towards
males compared to the same area prior to ﬁre or the control.
Cunningham et al. (2003) also found that although 16 cubs were
produced in the burn area and 13 in the control, no cubs survived in
the burned area versus 36% in the control.
4. Discussion
The small-diameter removal, burning, and thin/burn treat-
ments had broadly similar effects in terms of small mammal and
passerine bird response in the short-term (10 years). At the guild
level,
aerial-foraging
birds
beneﬁt
from
the
small-diameter
removal and burning treatments, but have negative responses to
overstory removal and wildﬁre, perhaps due to loss of habitat
components or the increased risk of predation by animals that
forage in the open. Tree-foliage and bole-foraging birds responded
neutrally or positively to the small-diameter removal and burning
treatments, but negatively to overstory removal and wildﬁre, as
expected from animals that require trees for foraging. Similar to
Zwolak (2009), we found that most ground-dwelling rodents
responded positively to small-diameter removal and thin/burn
treatments,
and
that
deer
mouse
(Peromyscus
maniculatus)
densities increased in both treatments and in response to wildﬁre.
However, although wildﬁre and overstory removal results in
similar, negative impacts on overall species densities, these
treatments are not equivalent in their effects. American kestrels
(the only raptor represented in our meta-analysis) responded
positively to the wildﬁre treatment, possibly because of their
increased ability to spot and catch prey in open sites, or the
increase in snags available for nesting (Village, 1990). This result
would not necessarily hold true for other raptors. Woodpeckers
declined in overstory removals, but did not appear to respond to
wildﬁres; we would have expected a positive response due to their
well-documented relationship with ﬁre and increased insect
foraging opportunities on snags and residual trees (Farris and
Zack, 2005; Covert-Bratland et al., 2006). Ground/shrub-foraging
birds were the only guild that responded positively to overstory
removal, suggesting that this treatment was effective in main-
taining or enhancing understory and shrub cover (Ffolliott and
Gottfried, 1989; Yorks et al., 2000). Overstory removal and wildﬁre
have different impacts. With overstory removal, higher levels of
biomass are removed, leaving stands with a more uniform
structure; wildﬁre leaves more standing biomass and patches of
unburned forest and snags (Spies and Turner, 1999). Olive-sided
ﬂycatchers (Contopus cooperi) responded positively to wildﬁre but
not overstory removal, which could be because these birds forage
in open areas with dead trees, but nest high in conifer trees, and
thus beneﬁt from a patchy forest structure (McGarigal and
McComb, 1995).
Similarly, no one treatment beneﬁts all species, at least over the
short-term. Even within the small-diameter removal treatment,
which had the greatest overall positive effect of the six treatments
on
species
densities,
house
wrens
and
red-faced
warblers
responded negatively relative to the controls. This could be due
to their need for understory vegetation for foraging (house wrens)
and nesting (red-faced warblers) (Wheye et al., 1988). Similarly,
the negative response of the Mexican woodrat (Neotoma mexicana)
to thin/burn treatment is likely caused by a lack of coarse woody
debris and downed logs, essential for nest-building and cover
(Converse et al., 2006; Coppeto et al., 2006). Thus, at least in the
near term, a combination of various treatments in a patchy
arrangement in time and space across the landscape is likely to
result in the highest diversity compared to any one treatment
(Noss et al., 2006a).
Species responses to time since small-diameter removal or
burning treatment were difﬁcult to interpret due to the lack of data
beyond 4 years for all species except the tassel-eared squirrel.
Ground/shrub-foraging birds demonstrated a positive response to
small-diameter removal and burning treatments over the ﬁrst 4
years post-treatment, which may indicate that the understory and
shrub layer is increasing in biomass and diversity during this time
(Ffolliott and Gottfried, 1989; Yorks et
al., 2000). Woodpeckers
show a positive response, which is likely due to increased snag
decay and insect activity in the years immediately following a
thinning or ﬁre (Chambers and Mast, 2005; Covert-Bratland et al.,
2007). The decreased density of tree- and bole-foraging species
suggests that these species emigrate from these areas since the
larger trees do not reestablish in this short time frame. The
increased density of the tassel-eared squirrel over a 10-year time
period, however, may be due to increased growth and vigor of large
pine trees (Fajardo et al., 2007) on which they depend (Patton and
Green, 1970).
The meta-analysis approach worked well in summarizing the
density response of multiple species across different treatments
over time at a coarse scale. However, a drawback of the approach is
that we were unable to quantify ﬁne-scale effects on wildlife. The
model selection analysis shows that there are similarities between
density responses measured in the same study and using the same
site; thus, there must be other important within-site variables that
we did not use as covariates in our analysis. Some may include
characteristics of the control stands, post-treatment tree density or
basal area, treatment intensity, seasonality of treatments, overs-
tory composition, number of snags, and understory characteristics,
as these variables were not consistently reported in the literature.
For example, our inability to include number of snags as a covariate
may be why we did not detect a positive response by woodpeckers
to the burning and wildﬁre treatments. The juxtaposition of
treatments on the landscape can also be very important to animals
associated with multiple habitat types or edges (Ries and Sisk,
2004), such as olive-sided ﬂycatchers (McGarigal and McComb,
1995) and spotted towhees (Battin and Sisk, 2003), which was not
assessed in this analysis.
Meta-analysis was also restrictive in the types of response
variables that could be analyzed. Only animal density could be
compared in treatments versus controls across different taxa,
which eliminated studies that examined other responses such as
home range size, diet, or habitat use. Since ﬁtness is often viewed
as the best indicator of population performance (Bock and Jones,
2004), we compared density and reproductive output results and
found that both were consistent in treatments versus controls
(either both positive or both negative) for the plumbeous vireo and
western
tanager
(Battin
and
Sisk,
2003),
western
bluebird
(Germaine
and
Germaine,
2002;
Wightman
and
Germaine,
2006; Hurteau et
al., in press), and tassel-eared squirrel (Dodd
et al., 2006). However, black bear had similar densities pre- and
post-ﬁre, and in burned areas versus control, but lower reproduc-
tive output in the burned areas (Cunningham et al., 2003). It is
well-documented
in
the
literature
that
density
is
often
a
misleading indication of habitat quality (Van Horne, 1983), for
example when the habitat assessed is a seasonal habitat that does
not accurately reﬂect the animal’s ﬁtness, as with animals that are

more limited by their winter habitat then their summer habitat.
Another problem is that territorial behavior often results in the
best habitat being claimed by a few, dominant individuals, while
the secondary habitat has a higher density of subordinate
individuals (Fretwell and Lucas, 1970). Thus, assessing wildlife
density may not always be meaningful in terms of understanding
changes in habitat, yet most studies in our review used this
response variable presumably because reproductive output is
more difﬁcult, time consuming, and costly to measure.
A ﬁnal problem was the lack of data for uncommon species. Due
to the multi-species approach taken by most bird and small
mammal studies, the same common species tend to be measured.
Only a few species-speciﬁc studies were available (Patton et al.,
1985; Cunningham et al., 2003; Dodd et al., 2006; Conway and
Kirkpatrick, 2007). Thus, these rare species tended to be under-
represented in the meta-analysis.
One outcome of meta-analysis is that it allows us to assess the
current state of knowledge on a subject and recommend areas for
future research. The vast majority of studies in the analysis were
short-term responses of birds to treatment (15 of 22). In particular,
recent studies (Berk, 2007; Kotliar et al., 2007; Hurteau et al., 2008;
Dickson et al., 2009; Pope et al., 2009) thoroughly assess 1–4 year
bird responses to prescribed ﬁre and thinning using sophisticated
modeling techniques, and we suggest that these studies be
carefully consulted before initiating similar research in order to
eliminate duplication of effort. There are 7 studies on small
mammals but all are short-term (<3 years, except for the tassel-
eared squirrel) and use small sites (<50 ha). Other underrepre-
sented taxa include reptiles and amphibians, as well as rare birds
and small mammals that are not easily assessed using conven-
tional point count and trapping methodologies; for example,
shrews (Sorex) or wild turkeys. Other species under- or un-
represented in this meta-analysis include medium and large
mammals, including both predators and ungulates, and birds of
prey. However, these species are not entirely ignored in the
literature, but rather density is generally not an appropriate
response variable for animals with large home ranges. However,
the lack of studies that assess reproductive responses of these
species indicates a paucity of research on these large and top
trophic animals.
Although small mammal and passerine bird species responded
positively to small-diameter removal and burning treatments
relative to the wildﬁre and overstory removal, they demonstrated
relatively neutral responses relative to the controls, which were
unmanaged stands. We expected stronger positive responses, but
this could be due to our inability to analyze differences in initial
(control) treatments or treatment intensity, which could affect the
magnitude of species’ responses. The lack of difference between
treatments and controls may also reﬂect the short-term nature of
the dataset, as it may take many years to see the positive effects of
the altered habitat (Chambers and Germaine, 2003). For example,
after thinning, deer mice would tend to use this disturbed site in
the short-term due to the increased foraging opportunities (Bock
and Bock, 1983), but ultimately golden-mantled ground squirrels
(Spermophilus lateralis) are probably better suited to the herbac-
eous habitats that would eventually reestablish (McKeever, 1964).
Thus, long-term studies are needed to provide a complete picture
of species response to treatments and habitat conversion.
5. Conclusion
This meta-analysis suggests that thinning and prescribed
burning of southwestern ponderosa pine and dry mixed conifer
forests will beneﬁt passerine birds and small mammals. Based on
the existing literature, small-diameter removal and/or burning
does
not
negatively
affect
species’
densities
compared
to
unmanaged forest stands, and is less detrimental than overstory
removal or wildﬁre. These results support the hypothesis that
thinning and burning at the landscape level are consistent with
ecological restoration objectives for wildlife. However, wildﬁre
and clearcut fuel breaks should be used with caution. In addition,
we identiﬁed several research needs, the results of which could
change these conclusions. We assessed thousands of papers on this
topic and found only 25 that produced sufﬁcient information for
meta-analysis, revealing a need for greater research coordination.
Studies at larger temporal and spatial scales, which examine more
informative response variables pertaining to animal ﬁtness for a
greater variety of species, are critical to fully understanding the
impacts of forest treatments on wildlife.
