A
major stumbling
block to ecosys-
tem management is the
lack of healthy ecosys-
tems to serve as points
of comparison. AIdo
Leopold (1934) recog-
nized this problem and
suggested 
using ecolog-
ical restoration tech-
niques to reconstruct
reasonable approxima-
tions of naturally func-
tioning 
ecosystems
(Callicott and Flader
1992). We have initi-
ated an integrated set
of research projects de-
signed to accomplish
this goal and in the
process determine eco-
system health attrib-
utes for a southwest-
ern ponderosa pine
ecosystem.
Previous research
has established that
forests of ponderosa
pine (Pinus ponderosa)
in the Southwest were
~ much more open be-
fore 
Euro-American
settlement (Cooper 1960; Covington
and Moore 1994b). Until the 1870s,
light surface fires every tWo to five
years, along with grass competition
and regular drought, maintained an
open and parklike landscape domi-
nated by grasses, forbs, and shrubs
with scattered groups of ponderosa
pine trees. After Euro-American settle-

characterized the ecosystem.
ment, heavy livestock grazing, fire sup-
pression, logging disturbances, and cli-
matic events favored dense ponderosa
pine regeneration, and the open park-
lands closed.
Various authors (Covington 
and
Moore 1 994a, 1994b; Kolb et al.
1994) have described unhealthy char-
acteristics of the postsettlement pon-
derosa pine ecosystems, including in-
creases in tree density, forest floor
depth, and fuel loading, with the fol-
lowing consequences: (I) decreases in
soil moisture and nutrient availability,
(2) decreases in growth and diversity of
both herbaceous and woody plants, (3)
increases in mortality in the oldest age
class of trees, (4) decreases in stream
and spring flows, and (5) increases in
fire severity and size.
Our research was guided by the fol-
lowing general hypotheses:
. that both restoration of ecosystem
structure and reintroduction of fire are
necessary for restoring rates of decom-
position, nutrient cycling, and net pri-
mary production to natural, presettle-
ment levels; and
. that the rates of these processes
will be higher in an ecosystem that ap-
proximates the natural structure and
disturbance regime.
Specifically, we hypothesized that
reestablishing 
presettlement 
stand
structure alone (thinning a majority of
the postsettlement trees) would result
in lower rates of decomposition, nutri-
ent cycling, and net primary produc-
tion compared with thinning, forest
floor fuel manipulation, 
and pre-
scribed burning in combination; but

that both treatments would result in
higher rates of these processes com-
pared with controls. We further hy-
pothesized that without periodic burn-
ing to hold them in check, pine
seedling irruptions would recur on the
thin-only treatment area. We addressed
three specific questions:
1. How have ecosystem structure

2. What are the implications of

duction, decomposition, nutrient cy-
cling, and other important ecosystem

3. Does partial restoration (restor-
ing tree structure alone by thinning

The Study
Our study area is a
virgin stand of pon-
derosa pine within the
Fort 
Valley 
Experi-
mental Forest approxi-
mately 
seven miles
northwest of Flagstaff,
Arizona. Stand struc-
ture is an uneven-aged
forest with 
trees in
small, 
uneven-aged
groups (fig. 1), typical
of ponderosa pine in
the Southwest (Cooper
1960; Schubert 1974;
White 
1985). 
Pole-
sized trees, approxi-
mately 4 to 14.5 inches
dbh, are the predomi.,
nant size class, with
scattered groups of pre-
settlement trees 14.5 to
41 inches dbh and
dense "doghair" thick-
ets of saplings up to 3.9
inches dbh. The treat-
ment plots are in an
eight-acre portion of the
G.A. Pearson Natural
Area, which was decom-
missioned in 1987. In-

are available at five-year in-
tervals from 1920 to the present (Avery
et al. 1976; and unpublished data).
The area is gentle in topography
(slopes less than 5 percent) with a
southwest aspect. Elevation is 7,200 to
7,400 feet. The climate is cool and
subhumid with eatly summer drought.
Mean annual precipitation 
is 22.3
inches and mean annual temperature is
45.5°F. Approximately half the precip-
itation falls as snow. The average frost-
free growing season is 94 days. Soils at
the study site are derived from basalt
and volcanic cinders and are a fine
montmorillonitic 
complex of frigid
Typic Argiborolls and Argiboralfs.
The understory consists primarily
of Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica),
mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia mon-
tana), mutton bluegrass (Poa fendleri-
ana), pine dropseed (Blepharoneuron
tricholepis), bottlebrush squirrel tail (5i-
fanion hysterix), and a variety of forbs.
Buckbrush (Ceanothus fendleri) is the
only common shrub.
The site has never been harvested;
the only major disturbances have been
livestock grazing between 1876 and
1910 and fire exclusion since 1876.
Dieterich (1980) determined that the
last natural fire in the vicinity occurred
in 1876; before that, fires occurred at
an average interval of about two years.

Scattered groups of southwestern ponderosa pine
predominated in the late 19th century (top),
before settlement suppressed natural wildfires. This
suppression caused a far greater profusion of
vegetation in dense "doghair" thickets of pine saplings
(middle). Researchers are now attempting, through
prescribed burns and manual thinning, to restore the
ecosystem to its original condition (bottom).

restoration of ponderosa pine ecosys-
tems are prescribed burning and thin-
ning from below (Covington 
and
Moore 1994b; Arno et al. 1995).
Previous research near our study
area had shown that although pre-
scribed burning alone (without thin-
ning or manual fuel removal) could
reduce surface fuel loads, stimulate ni-
trogen availability, and increase herba-
ceous productivity, 
it caused high
mortality 
of the presetclement trees
(60 percent mortality over a 20-year
period) and lethal soil temperatures
under presetclement tree canopies
(Covington and Sackett 1984, 1990,
1992; Harrington and Sackett 1990;
Sackett et al. 1993). Although some
thinning of postsetclement ponderosa
pine trees was accomplished by pre-
scribed burning 
(Harrington 
and
Sackett 1990), results were localized,
unpredictable, and difficult 
to con-
trol. Furthermore, even under very
conservative prescriptions 
(low air
temperatures and low windspeed), re-
burning can produce dangerous fires
(Covington and Sackett, pers. observ.,
1984-95) 
because the continuing
high density of postsetclement trees
provides a continuous fuel ladder and
thus a high crown-fire 
potential.
Clearly, research shows that prescribed
burning in today's unnatural structure
will not restore natural conditions in
ponderosa pine-bunchgrass ecosys-
tems. Thus, some combination 
of
thinning, 
manual fuel removal, and
prescribed burning will be necessary
to quickly restore these systems to nat-
ural conditions.
Design and Sampling
The study area was divided into 15
plots, five each in the complete restora-
tion (3.5 acres), partial restoration (3.3
acres), and control (3.8 acres) treat-
ments. Permanently marked photo
points were established. All plots were
completely stem-mapped in 1992, in-
cluding all living and dead trees and
large downed logs. Species, condition
class, and diameter at breast height
(4.5 feet) were recorded for all trees,
and all retained and control plot trees
were permanently tagged. All presettle-
ment and potentially presettlement
trees-those with diameter at breast
height >14.8 inches or yellowed bark
(White 1985)-were cored and cross-
dated (Stokes and Smiley 1968) to de-
termine age. Cross-sections or incre-
ment cores were taken from all pon-
derosa pine snags, stumps, and
downed trees that were potentially of
presettlement age. Samples were cross-
dated and, when possible, death date,
pith date, and diameter in 1876 were
determined. A random 5 percent sub-
sample of postsettlement trees was also
cored and aged.
Herbaceous and fuel variables were
measured on 55 replicated circular
subplots (16.4 feet in diameter) located
within four overs tory strata: (1) preset-
tlement patches, (2) postsettlement
patches to be thinned with some trees
retained, (3) postsettlement patches to
be converted to openings, and (4) rem-
nant natural grassy openings. Herba-

Results and Discussion
Dendrochronological 
analysis re-
vealed that 
forest structure 
had
changed substantially in our study area
since fire regime disruption (table 1).
Particularly striking is the population
growth of ponderosa 
pine from 22.8
trees per acre in 1876 to 1,253.5 trees
per acre in 1992. Although small-di-
ameter trees « 16 inches dbh) in-
creased from 3.4 per acre in 1876 to
1,240.7 in 1992, larger trees decreased
from 19.4 per acre in 1876 to 12.8 in
1992, despite protection from logging.
The irruption of smaller-diameter pine
trees also created ~ continuous tree
canopy cover (fig. 1) at the expense of
herbaceous vegetation. In 1876 only
19 percent of the surface area was
under pine canopy, with the balance
(81 percent) representing grassy open-
ings, whereas in 1992 pine canopycov-
ered 93 percent of the area, with only
7 percent left as grassy openings.
The spatial pattern of presetclement
trees in the Pearson Natural Area is
striking. These trees grew in distinct
ceous species composition, basal cover,
and production were measured on two
10.7 &2 quadrats within each subplot.
Forest floor fuels were averaged from
two 16.4-foot planar transects on each
subplot (Sackett 1980).
Both partial and complete restora-
tion areas were thinned in fall 1993
and the stumps cut to ground level.
All presettlement trees were retained,
as were all trees above 16 inches dbh.
In addition, smaller-diameter postset-
tlement 
trees were retained near
stumps, snags, and down presettle-
ment logs in an attempt to recreate
the clumped pattern of the presettle-
ment forest. Realizing that many of
the spindly postsettlement trees would
not survive, we left approximately
three postsettlement trees for every
dead presettlement tree.
Slash was removed in spring 1994
and an eight-foot electrified elk fence
was constructed around the study area
perimeter. On the complete restora-
tion treatment plots, the litter layer
(Oi) was raked aside, accumulated
duff (Oa and °e) was removed, and
litter was scattered back across the for-
est floor. Coarse woody fuels of pre-
settlement origin, such as the limbs
and boles of fallen presettlement trees,
were retained, but postsettlement
woody fuels were removed. Average
duff depth in the presettlement stra-
tum dropped from 3.3 to 0.4 inches
even though litter depth was nearly
unchanged (0.5 to 0.6 inches). Be-
cause the presettlement fuel structure
was composed primarily 
of grasses,
approximately 600 pounds per acre of
supplemental native grass fuels (har-
vested from a nearby natural meadow
in September 1994) was scattered
across the complete restoration plots.
Soil and tree cambial thermocouples
were installed in representative loca-
tions in each complete treatment plot
(Sackett and Haase 1992). The plots
slated for complete restoration were
then burned on October 12, 1994,
when the temperature was 58° to
60° F, winds were five to 10 mph from
the east-southeast, and relative hu-
midity was around 30 percent.
In addition to tree density, herba-

presettlement trees was higher on the
thinned area (4.4 ml per 24 hours)
than on the control area (3 ml per 24
hours), as was foliar toughness (76 g
of tension on thinned trees com-
pared with 69.8 g of tension on con-
trol trees), suggesting increased resis-
tance to bark beetles and foliage-
feeding insects. No changes in popu-
lations of turpentine beetles (Den-
droctonus va/ens) were observed.
Furthermore, herbaceous produc-
tion has responded markedly to the
treatments (fig. 4), with the greatest re-
sponse to date in the grassy substra-
tum. By 1995 the treated areas were
producing almost twice as much
herbaceous 
vegetation as the control.
longest period, with surface and soil
temperatures exceeding 2000 F (peak
temperature> 4000 F) for 24 to 48
hours. Fuels were reduced by the
burn to an average 4.3 tons per
acre-a total reduction of85 percent
from the pretreatment fuel loading.
During the 1995 growing season,
soil moisture and temperature were
consistently higher in treated areas
than in the control (figs. 2 and 3).
Soil moisture in treated areas is
higher probably because the canopy
and forest floor no longer intercept as
much precipitation, and there is also
less transpiration by postsettlement
trees. Higher mineral soil tempera-
tures are presumably the combined
result of increased insolation at the
soil surface and decreased insulation
at the forest floor.
We hypothesize that those micro-
environmental differences betWeen
treated and control areas will result
in higher rates of such soil processes
as fine root production, litter de-
composition, and nitrogen mineral-
ization in treated stands. Further-
mpre, we hypothesize that the
changes in the soil process rates will
in turn increase herbaceous produc-
tion, tree growth, and resistance to
insect attack. In fact, resin flow of
0.05- to 0.7-acre groups of two to 40
trees (White 1985; Fule et al. 1993).
Although canopy cover within a group
can be quite high, when ave~aged with
the inters paces that have no tree
canopy cover, the result is a low canopy
cover overall.
Thinning resulted in the removal of
901 trees per acre. A total of 5,500
board feet per acre (3,700 board feet
per acre of9- to 16-inch dbh trees plus
1,800 board feet per acre of 5- to 8.9-
inch dbh trees) was removed. Most of
the smaller-diameter trees (629 trees
per acre in the 1- to 4.9-inch dbh
class) were used as latillas for adobe
home construction, but the 37 tons
per acre of thinning 
slash posed a
major problem. Because there was no
market for this material, it was hauled
to a borrow pit and burned; the re-
moval required about 75 loads in 18-
wheel dump trucks.
Before the forest floor was raked,
fuel loads averaged 28.3 tons per acre.
Approximately 21.3 tons per acre of
duff was removed by raking, some of
which became garden mulch. Addition
of mown grass (0.3 tons per acre) on
the complete restoration treatment in-
creased forest floor fuel loading to 7.5
tons per acre; burning consumed 3.2
tons per acre, leaving 4.3 tons.
For 
the 
complete 
restoration
treatment, 
fire intensity 
was low:
flame 
lengths 
averaged approxi-
mately six inches with occasional
flare ups of one to two feet. Several
large dead and down presettlement
logs, however, burned intensely and
were completely consumed. Cambial
heating was also low or insignificant,
showing minor heat pulses (mean in-
crease = 44° F, n = 23) during the
burn. Individual 
thermocouples on
two trees registered higher tempera-
tures (maximum increases 82° and
147°F), but only on one of the six
probes per tree. Surface soil temper-
atures peaked in excess of 400° F
during burning, but subsurface tem-
peratures (one to four inches) ex-
ceeded 150° F on only one of five

Conclusions and Outlook
Preliminary results from our ecosys-
tem restoration work are encouraging.
The combination of thinning and
burning-the 
complete restoration
treatment-has changed forest struc-
ture from fire behavior fuel model 9
(Anderson 1982), in which crown fires
are common, to fuel model 2, in which
surface fires occur but crown fires are
highly improbable.
The reduction in tree competition
has improved moisture availability and
has likely increased insect resistance of
presetclement 
trees. Grasses, 
forbs, and
shrubs are responding favorably as
well, indicating a shift away from a net
primary productivity dominated by
pine trees toward a more diverse bal-
ance across a broader variety of plants.
Ecosystem restoration research re-
quires a long-term, interdisciplinary
commitment. We expect the ecosystem
attributes we are measuring to be in
transition for the next 10 to 20 years
before they stabilize around some long-
can alleviate many of the symptoms of
ecosystem pathology while simultane-
ously increasing our understanding of
ecosystem structure and function.
We argue that healthy conditions
should be based on an understanding
of the environmental conditions that
shaped the evolution of native forest
ecosystems, and we urge the use of
multidisciplinary measures of ecosys-
tem condition for understanding eco-
system health. ~
term mean. We plan to continue this
project for the next 24 years with eight
burnings at three-year intervals, timed
to coincide with the natural spring and
summer burning season. Data on other
attributes will be used to increase un-
derstanding of the restoration treat-
ments on a range of ecosystem charac-
teristics. For example, we hypothesize
that the complete restoration treat-
ment will increase soil moisture and
mineralization and uptake of nitrogen,
leading to increased photosynthesis,
growth efficiency, and resin produc-
tion by presettlement trees, and in-
creased cover and production 
by
shrubs and herbaceous vegetation.
With favorable climatic events, we ex-
pect pine seedlings to become estab-
lished on the partial restoration treat-
ment, repeating the pine irruptions
that occurred after fire regime disrup-
tion in the 1870s.
Realizing that the intensive re-
search-oriented treatments we have
used in this research project are im-
practical on an operational scale, we
have joined with the Arizona Strip Dis-
trict of the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment to test practical ecosystem res-
toration treatments on a larger scale in
the Mount Trumbull Resource Con-
servation Area, north of the Grand
Canyon. There we are using an adap-
tive ecosystem management approach
(Walters and Holling 1990) to restore
more than 3,000 acres of ponderosa
pine to conditions 
approximating
those that existed before Euro-Ameri-
can settlement. We are using more
practical approaches, such as raking
the forest floor away from the base of
the presettlement trees (instead of re-
moving it completely) and monitoring
a subset of our basic ecosystem health
attributes.
Because the treatment areas at
Mount Trumbull are large, we are now
able to measure some variables that op-
erate on a larger scale, such as passerine
bird populations, community structure
of selected insect guilds (butterflies),
and other indicators of landscape-scale
ecosystem health. Our hope is that
through such a set of integrated, adap-
tive ecosystem restoration projects, we
