Abstract
We surveyed forestry contractors in three sectors (logging, mastication, and trucking) across the 
states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado. Our survey sought to gather current demographic 
and background information on contractors as well as establish how a forest operations training 
center might address their employee training needs. Most of the businesses surveyed were small, 
with owner ages tending to be high (over 50) but employee ages much lower (under 40). Finding 
skilled workers was identified as the greatest barrier to success by the respondents, underscoring 
the need for more training opportunities. The majority of respondents (86%) did not have access 
to any external training programs. Survey results indicated a high demand for training programs 
for forestry contractors in the Southwest, which could play a vital role for the region to achieve 
landscape-scale forest restoration goals.
Study Implications: A forest operations training center (FOTC) could provide benefits to 
southwestern US forestry contractors and to forest restoration efforts in the region. Our survey 
findings suggest that through training, the FOTC can effectively help promote a transition to mech­
anized operations that can advance the forest products industry in the Southwest. The FOTC should 
focus on training operators of in-woods machines primarily but also maintenance technicians and 
truck drivers. Additionally, there is a need to identify opportunities to incentivize business support 
and buy-in to training programs to help the FOTC succeed.

The successful and timely completion of landscape-level 
forest restoration efforts in the southwestern United 
States hinges on establishing and maintaining a sus­
tainable forestry workforce. Past forest management 
practices of fire suppression, logging, and grazing have 
resulted in overstocked forests in need of restoration ac­
tivities such as mechanical thinning and prescribed fire 
(Covington et al. 1997). However, the forest industry in 
the western United States has been in decline for several 
decades (Keegan et al. 2011), and there are national con­
cerns about maintaining a qualified workforce of timber 
harvesters (Xu et al. 2014a) and truck drivers (Cook 
2019). As an example from the Southwest, Arizona’s 
Four Forests Restoration Initiative succeeded in thin­
ning 12,450 acres in 2017 using a workforce of 87.1 full 
time equivalent loggers and truckers (Hjerpe et al. 2021).

Assuming a linear scaling factor (Combrink et al. 2012), 
meeting the Four Forests Restoration Initiative’s stated 
goals of thinning 50,000 acres per year would require a 
total of 349.8 trained loggers and truckers. Identifying 
in-demand training needs and fostering greater access to 
those opportunities to expand the availability of quali­
fied professionals is therefore paramount to prepare for 
the anticipated labor demand for upcoming forest res­
toration projects.
One potential tool for expanding and enhancing 
the skilled forestry workforce in the Southwest is the 
facilitation of vocational training opportunities so 
that students can gain foundational experience and 
education. This offers contracting companies the op­
portunity to recruit employees with a higher level of 
training and allows trainees to become more successful 
on the job market. Other regions of the US are al­
ready addressing this need with enhanced training op­
portunities, for example, through the creation of the 
Shasta College Heavy Equipment Logging Operations 
and Maintenance program and the Northern Maine 
Community College Mechanized Logging Operations 
Program. The Southwest is now following suit; the 
Ecological Restoration Institute received funding to 
begin planning for a forest operations training center 
(FOTC) near Flagstaff, Arizona that will serve the re­
gion. The center will provide training for in-woods 
machine operators, repair and maintenance techni­
cians, and log truck drivers in the southwestern states 
of Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado.
Overview of Existing Forest Workforce 
Research
Surveys of forestry contractors are regularly conducted 
in areas such as the southeastern US (Greene et  al. 
2013, Conrad et al. 2018a), the Lake States (Smidt and 
Blinn 1994, Gc et al. 2020), and elsewhere (Bolding 
et  al. 2010, Leon and Benjamin 2012). Despite the 
rich survey-focused forestry contractor literature from 
the eastern US, there are very few published surveys 
from the western US (Allen et al. 2008, Vaughan and 
Mackes 2015) and even fewer from the Southwest spe­
cifically (Egan 2011). Most of these existing surveys 
target loggers and do not include truckers or mastica­
tion contractors, overlooking a critical component of 
forest operations that can expand our understanding 
of industry capacity and needs.
A recent review of logging businesses in the US iden­
tified several major trends over the last several decades, 
including increased consolidation of the workforce, a 
reduction in employment, decreased profitability of firms, 
increased mechanization of operations, and an aging 
population of business owners (Conrad et  al. 2018b). 
However, few western states were included in the review 
and the southwestern states of Arizona and New Mexico 
were omitted entirely. One striking trend is the reduction 
in employment in the logging sector; nationwide, logging 
employment has dropped from 170,000 in the 1950s to 
100,000 in the 1970s to 51,000 in 2016, although per 
capita productivity has increased due to mechanization 
(Conrad et al. 2018b). Meanwhile, a shortage of truckers 
has been identified in general (Costello and Karickhoff 
2019) and specific to the forest products industry (Cook 
2019). In a survey of contract loggers in the Inland 
Northwest, “finding and retaining qualified workers” 
was identified as one of the top two barriers facing the 
success of the respondents (Allen et al. 2008).
Several survey studies have addressed the topic of 
logger training, although they often focus predomin­
antly on continuing education rather than vocational 
training for new forest machine operators and truck 
drivers. Haworth et  al. (2007) conducted a survey 
of logger education programs across the US. The 
average program required 10 contact hours per year 
for certification—a lot of time for logging businesses 
to take away from timber production operation, but 
likely not enough time for a new logger to learn skills 
to start the job. In a survey of loggers and logging 
business owners in northern New England, the highest 
priority topics for training were identified as safety, 
equipment maintenance, and communication and 
business skills (Egan 2005). A recent review of logging 
truck driver training programs concluded that lecture-
based training for truckers can be an effective tool, 
making the trainings more accessible and less costly 
(Smidt et al. 2021). Xu et al. (2014a) reported a strong 
preference by logging business owners to hire experi­
enced or trained workers; of all recent hires in their 
survey, two-thirds had experience on the job and one-
third had received formal training. Despite this, a sep­
arate study determined that vocational logger training 
programs have a negative net present value when tu­
ition is paid by logging firms (Xu et al. 2014b), sug­
gesting that such programs should be self-funded to 
be successful.
Current Status of Forest Operations in 
the US Southwest
State-specific research on the forest operations 
workforce is slowly expanding in the Southwest. In

Colorado, a recent survey indicated that the forestry 
workforce was struggling due to economic and policy 
events including the 2008 recession and a shift to­
ward service and stewardship contracts (Vaughan and 
Mackes 2015). In New Mexico, some of the biggest 
challenges faced by contractors have been reported 
to be a lack of demand for forest products, unreliable 
sources for raw wood, insurance costs, and federal re­
gulations (Egan 2011). The same study also suggested 
future efforts to document training needs for the for­
estry workforce. One major challenge in the Southwest 
is wood processing capacity; the scarcity of mills 
often leads to long trucking distances from the forest 
(Sorensen et al. 2016).
Compared with other parts of the country, log­
gers in the Southwest are generally less mechanized 
and rely heavily on chainsaw felling (Simmons et al. 
2020). When mechanized systems are used, rubber-
tired feller-bunchers and grapple skidders dominate 
(Townsend et al. 2019). Another common approach 
used in fuels reduction projects is mastication, par­
ticularly in the expansive piñon-juniper woodlands 
that occur across the Southwest (Wozniak et  al. 
2020). Masticators shred standing trees and shrubs 
and leave piles of shredded materials on site. Truck 
drivers account for over 20% of all employees in the 
logging sector, although they are often independent 
owner-operators rather than being employed directly 
by logging firms (Smidt et al. 2021). In this article, 
we refer specifically to truck drivers that transport 
raw wood products from the forest rather than truck 
drivers that transport processed wood products such 
as lumber or paper.
In response to the growing demand for contractor 
skill sets associated with forest restoration in the US 
Southwest, we developed and administered a survey 
targeting owners of logging, mastication, and trucking 
businesses in Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado. 
Below, we work to identify gaps in training that this 
emergent training center can address and provide re­
commendations for strengthening the forestry work­
force in both the Southwest and beyond. Specifically, 
the survey sought to address three research questions 
related to the effective and needs-based development 
of a training center:
	1.	 What role might an FOTC play in the Southwest?
	2.	 What might an FOTC curriculum include?
	3.	 How might contracting businesses engage with a 
training center?
Methods
Survey Development and Administration
We developed our survey instrument through a com­
bination of key informant interviews, a literature re­
view of existing research on employment in forest 
products and adjacent industries, and review of 
smaller-scale state-level surveys that were designed to 
assess other aspects of forest operations (Allen et al. 
2008, Vaughan and Mackes 2015). Iterative reviews 
of the survey questionnaire were made by the research 
team following each round of adjustments or modifi­
cations based on input from these sources. Questions 
related to four key topics that stem from our research 
questions: (1) characterization of forestry contracting 
operations, to understand their role and potential 
impact on Southwestern forestry issues; (2) cur­
rent business employment levels and future training 
needs, to help develop relevant curriculum for the 
training center; (3) workforce-related challenges the 
respondents’ businesses currently face, to understand 
the business needs and how a training center could 
help to address them; and (4) demographic informa­
tion, to aid analyses and track trends over time. The 
questionnaire included multiple choice, ranking, and 
percentage-based questions as well as space on the 
last page to provide additional comments related to 
training needs. We solicited feedback on our initial 
survey questions from a panel of eight experts and 
practitioners involved in logging prior to survey ad­
ministration and incorporated appropriate feedback 
into our final instrument. This research was approved 
by the Northern Arizona University Institutional 
Review Board (#1618261).
Our sample frame consisted of business owners 
of logging, mastication, or forest products trucking 
companies across three states: Arizona, New Mexico, 
and Colorado. These states represent the states in the 
Four Corners region of the United States except Utah, 
where the forest industry is primarily located in the 
northern part of the state and geographically discon­
tinuous from the rest of the region (Sorensen et al. 
2016). No comprehensive list of forestry contracting 
businesses or owners currently exists for this region, 
so we developed the sample frame through a combin­
ation of systematic web searches, requests for contact 
information from key informants in the logging in­
dustry, and where available, state-level mailing lists. 
This resulted in the identification of 343 contracting 
businesses based in our study area and involved in 
logging, mastication, and trucking operations. We

removed 44 businesses whose questionnaires were 
returned as undeliverable during the administra­
tion process, resulting in a final sample frame of 299 
business owners.
The survey was administered in November 2020 
as in-woods operations wound down for the winter, 
following a seasonal pattern that is common in the 
Southwest. Mail administration followed the tailored 
design method (Dillman et al. 2014) and was enacted 
in three phases: (1) a mail survey packet, which con­
tained a letter explaining the study, a survey booklet, 
and a business reply envelope, (2) a reminder postcard, 
and (3) a final reminder letter. Each mailing included 
an option to complete the survey via online platform 
Qualtrics instead; questions were identical to the 
paper booklet to maintain consistency across modes. 
Additionally, announcements describing the survey and 
encouraging responses were shared with contractors in 
New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona by the state for­
ester of New Mexico, the Colorado Timber Industry 
Association, and the Forest Restoration Director of 
Coconino County, Arizona, respectively.
We conducted a nonresponse bias effort via phone 
in April 2021 to determine whether data obtained 
from respondents were representative of our entire 
sample frame. We contacted 10% of the remaining 
sample frame who did not provide a completed ques­
tionnaire as per Lindner et al. (2001) and used both 
t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests to test for a signifi­
cant difference in selected questions. As an additional 
measure, we compared the first 30 respondents 
of our survey to the last 30 respondents, as some 
studies indicate that late respondents often behave 
like nonrespondents, allowing late respondent data 
to become a proxy for nonrespondents (Armstrong 
and Overton 1977). We tested for significant differ­
ences on a subset of core questions, including basic 
demographic data and business characteristics, with a 
focus on the percentage of work that the respondents 
did in terms of logging, mastication, and transporta­
tion. Tests found no significant difference between re­
spondents over time, indicating that nonrespondents 
are likely well represented by our data; additional de­
tail is provided below in our results.
Analysis
We used chi-square tests of independence for categor­
ical response variables and analysis of variance for nu­
merical response variables. Post hoc comparisons were 
made using Tukey adjustments for multiple compari­
sons. To report effect sizes, we used phi-value (φ) for 
chi-square tests (φ < 0.2 = small, 0.2 ≤ φ < 0.4 = me­
dium, φ ≥ 0.4 = large), eta-squared (η 2) for analysis of 
variance (η 2 < 0.035 = small, 0.035 ≤ η 2 < 0.085 = me­
dium, η 2 ≥ 0.085 = large), and Cohen’s D (d) for multiple 
comparisons (d < 0.35 = small, 0.35 ≤ d < 0.65 = me­
dium, d ≥ 0.65 = large). In all cases, we used an alpha 
level of 0.05 to determine statistical significance. In 
most questions, these statistical tests were conducted 
to investigate differences among the three states, and 
only reported when statistically significant. To answer 
specific research questions, we occasionally used these 
tests to compare responses with a different way of seg­
menting the population, such as business size or pri­
mary focus. Comments from the open-ended question 
at the end of the survey instrument are reported word-
for-word where appropriate.
Some questions required specific approaches for 
analysis. We asked respondents to rank seven dif­
ferent predefined barriers in terms of how impactful 
to their business they were, with a ranking of 1 being 
a major barrier and 7 being a lesser barrier. To analyze 
this, we calculated the mean ranking given to each 
barrier to produce a noninteger value. The barriers 
were then ordered by the mean rank and assigned an 
integer from 1 to 7, with 1 being the strongest overall 
barrier and 7 being the least. In a different question, 
we asked respondents to identify the experience level 
required for various operations. We defined low ex­
perience as requiring 1  year to master, medium re­
quiring 2–3  years to master, and high requiring 4 
or more years. We ranked the positions by recoding 
“low” to a value of 1, “medium” to 2, “high” to 3, 
and then averaging the scores. A higher average score 
indicates a job requiring a higher level of experience 
and knowledge.
We asked businesses that engaged in logging activ­
ities about the equipment they used for various tasks. 
One question, specifically targeted towards mastica­
tion businesses, asked the percentage of their work 
that was done using mastication machines with an in­
tegrated head versus a boom-mounted one (as defined 
in Vitorelo et  al. 2009). Another question, targeted 
toward loggers, asked the percentage of felling that 
they do using three distinct machines: feller-bunchers, 
harvesters, and chainsaws. Loggers were also asked to 
report percentage of stump-to-truck extraction using 
several different machines: skidders, forwarders, cable 
yarders, and helicopters. For these types of questions, 
we summarized responses into the primary equipment 
for each task (highest percentage reported), rather than 
reporting percentages themselves.

Results
Response Rate and Nonresponse Bias
We received 66 completed questionnaires out of 299 
for a 22.1% response rate. This response rate is con­
sistent with other recent efforts to survey sectors of 
the forestry industry, including Milauskas and Wang 
(2006) with 10.2%, Baker and Greene (2008) with 
24%, and Vaughan and Mackes (2015) with 32.6%. 
Our comparison of the first 30 respondents with the 
last 30 did not reveal any statistically significant differ­
ences. Quantitative data collected during nonresponse 
bias phone calls did indicate differences between the 
respondents and nonrespondents in terms of their log­
ging focus, both using Mann-Whitney tests and t-tests. 
Nonrespondents were commonly retired, 10% or less 
of their company’s activities were related to logging, 
mastication, or trucking, or they performed urban 
tree care rather than in-woods operations. For these 
reasons, most of the contacted nonrespondents felt the 
survey was not relevant to them; hence their lack of 
participation. These two tests indicate that (1) our ini­
tial sample frame may have been too broad, leading 
some to believe that it was irrelevant and therefore 
deciding not to participate, and (2) based on our com­
parison of early to late responders, there was no evi­
dence for nonresponse bias within our population of 
interest. In summary, although response rate is some­
what low, our target population is well represented 
within our data and those respondents provided con­
sistent responses.
Characterizing the Southwest’s Forestry 
Contracting Industry
Most respondents engaged in multiple types of work 
rather than focusing exclusively on logging, mastica­
tion, or trucking (Figure 1). The number of businesses 
that had 100% focus on one segment was small (21 
businesses out of total 66), but was highest in log­
ging (10), followed by mastication (six), then trucking 
(five). Although this survey did not seek information 
about work outside of these three contracting business 
sectors, many respondents voluntarily reported other 
lines of work, including construction, snow plowing, 
landscaping, erosion control, and more.
Eleven of the responses came from Arizona 
(16.7% of the total response), 16 from New Mexico 
(24.2%), and 39 from Colorado (59.1%). These re­
sponses tracked closely with the number of surveys 
sent to each state, which was 55 to Arizona (18.4% 
of the sample frame), 70 to New Mexico (23.4% of 
the sample frame), and 174 to Colorado (58.2% of 
the sample frame), meaning that the response rate was 
fairly consistent across states. Many respondents per­
formed work in multiple states, but in all but two cases 
they performed the majority of their work in the state 
where their business headquarters was located.
The majority of respondents had under $100,000 
in investments (building and land assets not included; 
Table 1). As the capital investment category increased, 
the number of respondents decreased, with the excep­
tion of the highest category (> $1,500,000). When it

business focus. For example, although 50 respondents reported that logging made up at least a part of their business, 
fewer (28 respondents) reported that 75–99.9% of their business was logging, and only 10 reported that 100% was logging.

comes to capital investments, the majority of our re­
spondents were on the lower or higher end, with fewer 
in the middle. Participants were asked how many 
months of scheduled work they currently held under 
contract. Approximately 34.9% of respondents had 
only a short window of planned work (0–5 months), 
44.4% reported 16 or more months, with the re­
maining respondents distributed between these two 
extremes. The mean experience reported by businesses 
in the logging, mastication, and/or trucking field was 
27.7 years, and the mean length of time operating their 
business was 22.0 years.
The vast majority of the respondents had high 
school degrees or greater, and more than half had two-
year degrees or greater (Table 1). Results showed that 
35.9% of respondents were 60 years of age or older, 
and no respondents were under 30 (Table 1, Figure 
2). Employee ages were skewed much younger, with 
30.8% reported as under 30 (Figure 2). The mean 
and median daily truckload productivity of the re­
spondents were 5.2 and 2.0 loads per day, respectively, 
where a truckload was defined as approximately 25 
tons of logs. Mean truckload productivity ranged from 
one or fewer loads per day up to 35 loads per day for 
the more productive logging operations. Respondents 
were also asked about their ideal daily productivity, 
which produced a mean ideal value of 7.9 truckloads. 
Among loggers, there was a statistically significant 
association between primary felling means and daily 
truckload productivity (F(2,43) = 5.8627, P = 0.0058). 
The eta-squared value was 0.222, indicating a large 
effect size. Pairwise comparisons indicated businesses 
relying on feller-bunchers to be significantly more pro­
ductive than those relying on chainsaws for tree felling 
by a mean value of 8.0 loads per day (Tukey-adjusted 
P = 0.0041). The Cohen’s D value of 1.02 indicated a 
large effect size.
The most common barrier to success identified by 
respondents was “finding skilled workers” (Table 2). 
Respondents also had the option to provide write-in 
answers regarding their barriers to success; this yielded 
several additions including “spotted owl moratorium” 
from three contractors based in New Mexico, “Forest 
Service regulations” from two contractors, and “insur­
ance rates” from two contractors.
Training Needs for Current and Future 
Employees
The businesses participating in this survey employed 
a total of 531.5 people in logging, mastication, and 
transportation sectors (counting part-time employees 
as half). The total number of people employed by 
organizations ranged widely; six businesses had no 
employees other than the owner, in contrast to 69 em­
ployees reported at the largest operation. The mean 
and median values for number of employees of the 
respondents’ businesses were 8.4 and 3.0, respect­
ively, indicating that most business firms were rela­
tively small in crew size. The majority of employees 
were in-woods forest equipment operators (42.3%), 
followed by truck drivers (21.4%). Approximately 
15.6% of employees were in the “other” category, 
which primarily consisted of chainsaw fallers and 
general labor.
Internal training was the dominant form of training, 
with 86% of businesses relying exclusively on internal 
training for their employees. Of those that relied on in­
ternal training, 85.4% indicated that internal training 
was the only training option available, with the re­
mainder stating that external training programs were 
too expensive (10.4%) or of low quality (4.2%). Only 
14% of respondents reported using external training 
programs at all; in these cases, external training was 
offered to between 5% and 100% of employees.
Respondents were asked whether they had formal 
safety plans, and whether such plans led to reduced 
insurance costs. Only 36.5% of respondents indicated 
that they had formal safety plans in place, with the 
rest relying on informal interventions such as “keeping 
an eye out for dangerous behavior” or “mentorship.” 
A chi-squared test found a statistically significant as­
sociation between the presence of formal safety plans 
and confirmation of reduced insurance premiums (χ 2 
(2, n = 57) = 12.082, P = 0.0024). The phi-value was 
0.46, indicating a medium effect size.

The most highly desired education level for an 
entry-level position was “high school diploma”, 
selected by 60% of respondents. Nearly 22% (21.5%) 
of businesses would prefer to hire a graduate of an 
FOTC, 10.8% would prefer to hire someone with 
a bachelor’s degree, and 7.7% would prefer to hire 
someone with no high school degree. Collectively, re­
spondents reported that they would be hiring a total 
of approximately 465.5 new employees over the next 
five  years in the logging, mastication, and transpor­
tation sectors. These were predominantly in the cat­
egory of in-woods forest machine operators, with 
smaller representation in specialized maintenance and 
truckers (Figure 3).
Chainsaws and feller-bunchers were the dominant 
means of tree felling, with 43.4% of respondents relying 
primarily on chainsaws for felling, 43.4% relying pri­
marily on feller-bunchers, and only 13.2% relying pri­
marily on harvesters. The proportion of contractors 
relying primarily on chainsaws was highest in New 
Mexico (58.3%) and lowest in Arizona (22.2%), al­
though this difference was not statistically significant. 
Despite the dominance of manual felling with chain­
saws, there was some interest expressed in increasing 
mechanization. One respondent included in this survey’s 
final comments: “I would like to eventually move to a 
more mechanized operation but that would require add­
itional training … To be perfectly honest I would like to 
have additional training opportunities to operate equip­
ment myself”. For stump-to-truck extraction, skidders 
were by far the most dominant, with 85.7% of respond­
ents relying primarily on skidders and 14.3% relying

primarily on forwarders. No respondents relied pri­
marily on yarders or helicopters, but some did use them 
occasionally. For mastication contractors, masticators

Discussion
Our survey sought to investigate the current condition 
of the forestry workforce in Arizona, New Mexico, and 
Colorado, before determining current capacity and fu­
ture training needs that can help contractors meet the 
growing demand for forest operations on landscape-
scale projects. Respondents described a diverse current 
workforce that they intend to expand in coming years. 
Major threats to workforce expansion were challenges 
associated with the cost and availability of training, 
limited return on investment for businesses paying for 
employee training themselves, identification of trained 
professionals to hire, and increasing costs associated 
with forest operations. Below, we discuss these find­
ings and their implications for the development of a 
regional training center in the Southwest.
What Role Might an FOTC Play in the 
Southwest?
Survey results indicate that a southwestern FOTC 
could provide benefits to local forestry contractors 
and to forest restoration efforts as a whole. The lar­
gest barrier to business success identified by the re­
spondents was “finding skilled workers,” with many 
indicating that this is due to a scarcity of external 
training programs for forest operations throughout 
the Southwest region. This aligns with existing con­
cerns about maintaining a skilled workforce in the 
forest products industry (Xu et  al. 2014a), which 
has led to a resurgence in training programs and 
provided the motivation for the current study. Our 
results confirmed the fact that most forestry contrac­
tors operating in the Southwest do not have access to 
any external training programs for their employees. 
Having the opportunity to learn safe and productive 
practices in a less stressful environment may lead to 
increased retention of skilled workers by the contrac­
tors. These results support the need for an FOTC to 
be developed in the Southwest region.
Existing concerns about workforce capacity in 
southwestern forest restoration projects could be amp­
lified by looming retirements if the problem is not 
addressed. Our survey showed that the mean age of 
forestry contracting business owners is over 50, which 
is a consistently documented challenge identified 
in forest operations surveys (Baker & Greene 2008, 
Conrad et  al. 2018b). Interestingly, employee ages 
skewed the other way, with respondents reporting that 
the majority of their employees were under 40 years 
old. This stands in contrast to a 2005 survey of log­
gers in Idaho in which over half of the employees were 
over 40 years of age (Allen et al. 2008). This signals 
a new generation of forestry professionals, and any 
training programs developed to serve this popula­
tion must consider how their curriculum and course 
content contribute to retention of this younger work­
force. This finding also indicates an influx of younger 
people who have an interest in forestry-related careers. 
Training centers can play a role in retaining these stu­
dents by partnering with colleges that offer forestry or 
other natural resource-related degrees, certificates, and 
courses to develop bridging programs that can funnel 
trained graduates into entry-level positions as demand 
continues to increase. Partnerships should incorporate 
a diverse range of training pathways, including com­
munity colleges, four-year degree programs, voca­
tional training programs, and high school internships 
or assistantships. Recognizing that as the current older 
population of business owners transitions into retire­
ment, this new generation of foresters will eventually 
need to acquire the skills to establish or oversee busi­
nesses in this field, training centers are well-positioned 
to provide generalized early-stage education to support 
this transition.
What Might a Training Center Curriculum 
Include?
An FOTC has the opportunity to provide training 
that could shape the future direction of the industry; 
however, that must be carefully balanced with serving 
the needs of currently existing businesses and helping 
graduates to secure jobs. Our survey provides useful 
information about what forestry machines are cur­
rently being used in the Southwest, and, therefore, 
what students should be trained on to meet current 
needs. Results also suggest possibilities for a training 
center to expose owners and employees to newer tech­
niques, thus helping them grow and better perform in 
their contracting business operations.
Survey results indicate that when mechanized logging is 
performed in the Southwest, feller-bunchers and skidders 
are by far the most dominant machines employed. 
Harvesters and forwarders are rarely used, which stands 
in contrast to other parts of the country, such as the Lake 
States (Conrad et al. 2018b, Gc et al. 2020). This is con­
sistent with findings from Vaughan and Mackes (2015), 
who reported that at the time of the study and based on 
equipment owned, only one Colorado contractor engaged

in cut-to-length harvesting. Cable yarders and helicopters 
are a minor component of the picture in the Southwest, 
likely due to the low value of the timber and the high 
cost of such operations. Our results suggest that for the 
training center to produce graduates that are hirable by 
the currently operating businesses in the Southwest, the 
curriculum should have a strong focus on feller-bunchers 
and skidders. Respondents also reported that masticators 
with an integrated mulching head are much more com­
monly used than those that are mounted on a boom, as 
mastication is more commonly used to shred shrubs than 
tall trees. This should be taken into consideration in con­
versations with equipment dealers about which types of 
machines to purchase or lease for training centers.
Survey results show that chainsaws are widely used 
as a primary felling means by contractors in the US 
Southwest; they are tied with feller-bunchers in usage 
and much more common than harvesters. Although 
not statistically significant, New Mexico contractors 
were more reliant on chainsaws than either of the 
other two states. The prevalence of chainsaw felling is 
likely due to the lower capital investment (purchasing 
and maintenance) of chainsaws. Conrad et al. (2018b) 
reported some other regions where chainsaw use dom­
inates for felling, such as the Northeast, West Virginia, 
and Idaho. Despite the prevalence of chainsaws in 
these areas, in all cases, mechanized systems account 
for most of the volume removed. Mechanized logging 
is capable of achieving much larger-scale forest man­
agement objectives than chainsaw-based logging and is 
considerably safer for the operators (Lagerstrom et al. 
2019). This highlights an opportunity for a Southwest 
training center to encourage mechanized operations 
through specialized trainings. Survey respondents typ­
ically reported an ideal productivity (in truckloads) 
that was higher than their current productivity; that 
desire to grow businesses may be well supported by 
increased mechanization, and training centers can aid 
in that transition by providing qualified operators. 
Because mechanized operations are less common in 
the Southwest, training programs related to this topic 
should appeal to employees at all career stages. There 
may also be abundant opportunities to engage with ex­
isting training centers in other regions of the US where 
mechanized operations are already heavily incorpor­
ated to develop effective courses that build from those 
regions’ successes.
This survey identified a large number of antici­
pated hires in logging, mastication, and trucking over 
the next five  years. Those hires will focus primarily 
on forest equipment operators, with a much smaller 
demand for trucking hires. Truckers are a vital link 
in the supply chain, and other studies have concluded 
that trucker shortages are beginning to affect the forest 
products industry (Cook 2019). One explanation for 
this seemingly low trucker demand by our survey re­
spondents could be that many of the loggers inter­
viewed contract out their trucking rather than employ 
truckers directly. It is also possible that truckers are pri­
marily single-person owner-operators, so they would 
not be hired onto large trucking firms. Nevertheless, 
if forest operations are to expand in the region, the 
trucking capacity must also expand. It is recommended 
that training centers offer commercial driver’s license 
programs or partner with local vocational schools to 
offer this training.
How Might Contracting Businesses Engage 
with a Training Center?
This survey’s results showed that the logging, masti­
cation, and trucking businesses of the Southwest are 
generally small businesses with low capital invest­
ments and a small number of employees, similar to 
the findings of Vaughan and Mackes (2015) regarding 
Colorado. Many of the businesses have been in exist­
ence for a long time, and owners have several decades 
of experience in their trade. They engage in a variety 
of different job types, often due to the inherent sea­
sonality of forestry work. Our findings that most busi­
ness owners had two-year post-high school degrees or 
higher are similar to those of Xu et al. (2014a), who 
reported that loggers from the West were more likely 
to have a bachelor’s degree or some college than other 
regions from their national survey.
Owners overwhelmingly indicated a preference 
for hiring employees with a high school degree, with 
fewer specifying a “certificate from a forest operations 
training center.” Because no such training center cur­
rently exists in the Southwest, many respondents to the 
survey may have been confused by the question and not 
selected that option. It is impossible to determine from 
our results whether the FOTC certificate was not the 
most highly selected education level because no such 
center currently exists or for some other reason (e.g., 
owners assume they would have to pay them more and 
therefore wouldn’t want to hire them). In either case, 
these results indicate that a high school degree should 
be a prerequisite for applicants to the training center.
Incentivizing business participation or investment 
in training may prove to be an effective model for 
maintaining a productive workforce that is invested 
in by businesses in the Southwest. Respondents to our

survey who had formal safety plans in place benefitted 
from reduced insurance rates, and although our data 
cannot determine whether that reduction was the mo­
tivation for safety plan development or a secondary 
benefit, it does indicate that formalized trainings can 
improve businesses’ economic well-being. Additional 
research is needed to (1) determine how effective incen­
tives like insurance reductions might be for encouraging 
businesses to send their employees to trainings and 
how much of a financial incentive is needed for par­
ticipation, (2) how incentivized trainings might shift 
recruiting patterns, and (3) the extent to which busi­
nesses might be willing to invest in training programs 
that meet company-specific needs.
Helping businesses establish formalized safety plans 
may act as a gateway to greater investment in training. 
The majority of respondents did not have formal safety 
plans for their business, and although there are benefits 
to informal types of risk management, this can open 
businesses up to legal issues associated with workplace 
accidents. Due to the high danger associated with the 
logging profession (Lagerstrom et  al. 2019), steps 
should be taken to increase the use of formal safety 
plans. Safety is typically given a high priority in logger 
education and training programs (Egan 2005, Haworth 
et  al. 2007) and should be emphasized strongly in 
any program started in the Southwest. Safety-focused 
courses may also provide a gateway for employees to 
learn about more specialized training; we recommend 
that any safety education the training center provides 
makes explicit connections to other training opportun­
ities and that the theme of safety is present throughout 
all course offerings.
Conclusions
We surveyed owners of logging, mastication, and 
trucking businesses in Arizona, New Mexico, and 
Colorado. The primary goal of the survey was to in­
form the development of an FOTC, and secondary 
goals were to gather demographic information about 
the businesses, assess the workforce capacity, and 
understand barriers to success. The large number of 
anticipated hires contrasted with the absence of skilled 
workers available underscores the value and benefits 
a training center could provide for the forest products 
industry in the Southwest. Results from this survey 
can help with curriculum development of an FOTC 
that addresses region-specific needs as demand for 
forest restoration continues to expand. We recommend 
that efforts focus on (1) maintaining and supporting 
the current influx of young professionals in this field; 
(2) promoting a transition to mechanized operations 
through training that can advance the forest products 
industry in the Southwest; (3) training operators of 
in-woods machines primarily, but also maintenance 
technicians and truck drivers; and (4) identifying op­
portunities to incentivize business support and buy-in 
to training programs that can help foster safer and 
more sustainable and economic operations. Training 
programs for forestry contractors in the Southwest are 
in high demand and offer a path forward to help the 
region achieve landscape-scale forest restoration goals.
