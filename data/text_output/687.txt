Tree Size and Drought Affect
Ponderosa Pine Physiological
Response to Thinning and
Burning Treatments

ABSTRACT.  Thinning and burning treatments based on presettlement (prior to Euro-
American settlement) stand conditions have been proposed for improving the vigor and
growth of Pinus ponderosa. No study has examined effects of different levels of such thinning
treatments on tree water, carbon, and nitrogen relations, or compared effects between
postsettlement (trees established after Euro-American settlement) and presettlement (estab-
lished before Euro-American settlement) trees. We investigated responses of presettlement
and postsettlement trees to three levels of thinning and burning (unthinned/unburned control,
light thinning/burning, heavy thinning/burning) over 2 yr that differed in precipitation in
northern Arizona. Both thinning treatments consistently increased predawn water potential of
both tree sizes compared with the control. Effects of thinning on leaf gas exchange varied
between tree sizes and measurement times. Thinning increased net photosynthetic rate and
stomatal conductance only when soil water availability was lowest, and increases were greater
for postsettlement than presettlement trees. In contrast, thinning had no effect on foliar
nitrogen concentration.
Our results suggest greater positive effects of restoration thinning on tree water and carbon
relations for postsettlement versus presettlement trees, and under drought versus nondrought
conditions. Photosynthetic response to thinning in old trees may be constrained by physiologi-
cal factors associated with large size such as low soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance. FOR. SCI.

AST AND CURRENT land management practices have
altered forests of the Southwestern United States and
associated forest management issues (Cooper 1960,
Covington and Moore 1994, Covington et al. 1997, Fulé et al.
1997). Fire suppression, overgrazing, and other factors pro-
duced today’s dense ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl.
ex. Laws) forests, which contain thickets of slow-growing
young trees, declining old-growth trees, and high fuel load-

ing (Covington and Moore 1994, Covington et al. 1997,
Dahms and Geils 1997). Land managers, researchers, and
concerned citizens’ groups are experimenting with possible
solutions to these undesirable conditions that would reduce
forest floor fuel loading, reduce “ladder fuels” in the under-
story, increase growth and insect resistance of trees, and
stimulate productivity of declining old trees, which are scarce
due to past harvests.
Possible solutions range from no action to complete resto-
ration of forest structure to the open conditions that were
common prior to Euro-American settlement (presettlement)
because of frequent surface fires (Weaver 1951, Swetnam
and Baisan 1996, Fulé et al. 1997, Mast et al. 1999, Moore et
al. 1999). Proactive treatments being considered include
thinning, prescribed burning, or a combination thereof. No
action would likely result in extreme forest changes that are
difficult to predict or control, such as stand-replacing fire and
insect outbreaks (Covington et al. 1997, Fulé et al. 1997). The
use of the presettlement forest as a model for today’s forest
management is another possible solution (Covington et al.
1997, Moore et al. 1999). Such a model uses evidence of local
presettlement stand structure and natural disturbance regime
as a reference condition to define desired future conditions.
Presettlement stand structure and disturbance regime are
considered to best approximate the environment under which
native species evolved (Moore et al. 1999). Limitations of
this strategy include the difficulty of knowing presettlement
conditions, possible changes in climate since presettlement
times, and lack of information about effectiveness of treat-
ments based on presettlement conditions (Wagner et al. 2000,
Baker and Ehle 2001).
Previous restoration or thinning studies in southwest-
ern ponderosa pine forests either focused on postsettlement
trees in stands that were evenly thinned using traditional
silvicultural prescriptions (Ronco et al. 1985, Cochran and
Barrett 1993, Kolb et al. 1998), or focused on presettlement
trees in stands fully restored to presettlement structure and
tree density (Covington et al. 1997, Feeney et al. 1998,
Stone et al. 1999). No previous research has compared
response to restoration treatments between presettlement
and postsettlement ponderosa pine trees that have grown
for 80 or more years under intense competition caused by
high tree density. Both presettlement and postsettlement
ponderosa pine trees grow slowly when stressed by severe
tree-to-tree competition and can be released from compe-
tition by appropriate thinning (Ronco et al. 1985, Cochran
and Barret 1993, Kolb et al. 1998, Feeney et al. 1998,
Stone et al. 1999, Latham and Tappeiner 2002).  However,
presettlement, or large old trees, differ physiologically
from younger trees and may respond differently to thin-
ning. For example, they may have higher maintenance
respiration demands because they may have more living,
nonphotosynthetic tissue than younger trees (Waring and
Schlesinger 1985, Ryan and Waring 1992, Ryan et al.
1995). More branch junctions and a longer root-leaf hy-
draulic path length may decrease hydraulic conductance in
old trees, which may limit photosynthetic rate (Ryan and
Yoder 1997). Slow growth of old ponderosa pine trees has
been attributed to these factors (Yoder et al. 1994, Hubbard
et al. 1999, Williams et al. 2001).
This study compares the influences of restoration thinning
and burning treatments on water, carbon, and nutrient rela-
tions of presettlement and postsettlement ponderosa pines.
The treatments include an untreated control and two levels of
thinning (light, heavy) combined with an understory burn.
Trees left on site were selected based on site-specific evi-
dence of presettlement stand structure (Covington et al. 1997,
Moore et al. 1999). We expected heavier thinning to decrease
competition for water and nutrients and increase carbon gain
for both presettlement and postsettlement trees. We antici-
pated higher leaf gas exchange and photosynthetic rates in
postsettlement trees than in presettlement trees, and a greater
response in these rates to thinning for postsettlement than
presettlement trees.
Methods
Study Site
The study site is within the Fort Valley Experimental
Forest (USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research
Station) located 10 km northwest of Flagstaff, Arizona
(N35˚15′58′′, W111˚42′1′′, elevation 2200 m). Mean annual
precipitation is 57 cm divided between winter snow and late
summer rain. The soils are classified as a basaltic, fine
montmorillonitic complex of frigid Typic Argiborolls and
Mollic Eutroboralfs (Mast et al. 1999). The average growing
season is 94 days (Schubert 1974). Ponderosa pine dominates
the Fort Valley Forest (99.8% of trees in plots), and untreated
average stand density was 1345 trees ha–1 with an average
basal area of 36.7 m2 ha–1 (Fulé et al. 1999). Trees less than
30 cm diameter at breast height (1.4 m above the base of each
tree, hereafter referred to as dbh) dominate this forest and
trees with dbh above 40 cm occur occasionally.
Thinning and Burning Treatments
The experiment included three levels of thinning: none
(control), light, and heavy. Each level was randomly assigned
to a single 17 ha plot. All plots have similar elevation, slope,
and aspect, and are located within 1 km of each other. The
unthinned control had a dense stand of pole-sized
postsettlement trees with some larger, interspersed
presettlement trees. All presettlement trees were retained in
thinned treatments. Selection of postsettlement leave trees on
thinned sites was based on evidence of presettlement trees.
Evidence of presettlement trees included snags, downed
trees, stumps, and stumpholes. Leave trees were located
within a 60 m radius of each presettlement tree evidence. The
heavy thinning treatment retained an average of 1.5 replace-
ment trees ≥40 cm dbh or three smaller trees for every
evidence of a presettlement tree. The light thinning treatment
retained three replacement trees ≥40 cm dbh or six smaller
trees for every evidence of a presettlement tree. If possible,
larger trees were chosen over smaller trees for retention. All
thinning treatments included understory broadcast burns and
unthinned controls were not burned.
Thinnings occurred between December 1998 and Septem-
ber 1999. Trees were felled by chainsaws, and boles were
hauled to landings and removed from the site. The heavy

thinning treatment was completed in April 1999, and the light
thinning was finished September 1999. In the summer of
2000, branches were piled by hand and machine. These piles
were burned in February 2001. After slash piles were burned,
low-intensity, understory broadcast burns consumed remain-
ing fuels (including duff, litter, and any remaining branches).
These broadcast burns were conducted in May 2001 using
spot/strip-firing techniques with drip-torches. Before burn-
ing, duff and needle litter were raked away from the base of
every presettlement tree to minimize heat girdling. This was
not necessary for postsettlement trees due to relatively low
amounts of litter at their base. Fires were low intensity to
minimize damage to tree roots, boles, or crown. Flame
lengths were 15–30 cm in needle litter and 60–120 cm in
woody slash. Rate of spread was between 0 and 40 m h–1.
Grassy areas did not carry fire. All trees used in our study had
less than 10% bole or crown scorch. Crown and bole scorch
below 50% have little effect on water potential or photosyn-
thetic rate of most conifers (Ducrey et al. 1996, Ryan 2000,
Wallin et al. 2003).
Pretreatment Condition and Comparisons
The three treatment areas were similar but not identical prior
to implementation of thinning and burning treatments. Basal
area (BA), trees per hectare (TPH), and stand density index (SDI,
Reineke 1933) prior to treatment in 1998 show a dense forest
crowded with small trees (Table 1). Because the maximum SDI
for ponderosa pine in northern Arizona is thought to be 450–600
(Martinez 1999), this forest was 45–80% of maximum stocking
before treatment. The light thinning reduced stand basal area by
43% from 38 m2ha–1 to 22 m2ha–1, and the heavy thinning
reduced BA by 46% from 33 m2ha–1 to 18 m2ha–1. The
unthinned control was 40 m2 ha–1 (Table 1).
We compared pretreatment values of leaf carbon isotope
ratio and bole radial growth rate of trees among treatment
areas to investigate pretreatment differences in tree physi-
ological characteristics and growth. The ratio of two carbon
isotopes—carbon 12 (12C) and carbon 13 (13C)—in leaf
structural tissue (δ13C) is a time-integrated measure of leaf
internal CO2 concentration, which depends on the balance
between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance (Farquhar
and Lloyd 1993). Water deficits or other factors that reduce
stomatal conductance often increase assimilation of 13C
relative to 12C, and increase δ13C (Farquhar et al. 1989,
Kozlowski and Pallardy 1997). Foliar δ13C of leaves (bulk
tissue) formed in 1998 (before treatments) was not signifi-
cantly different among treatment areas (P = 0.110, df = 2),
tree sizes (P = 0.340, df = 1), and their interaction was not
significant (P = 0.39, df = 2). This finding suggests a similar
balance between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance,
and similar leaf internal CO2 concentration, for trees in the
three treatments areas prior to treatment.
Tree size (P = 0.022, df = 1) and the thinning treatment ×
tree size interaction (P = 0.025, df = 2) were significant
sources of variation in average radial growth rate 10 yr prior
to treatment (1988–1998), but treatment did not significantly
influence growth (P = 0.710, df = 2). Presettlement tree
growth did not differ among treatments areas before treat-
ment (P > 0.15).  Average growth of postsettlement trees did
not differ between the control and lightly thinned plots (P =
0.784), but was significantly higher in the heavily thinned
plot (P = 0.013), which also had the lowest pretreatment BA
(Table 1). Overall, these pretreatment comparisons suggest
similar stand stocking and tree growth rates for the control
and lightly thinned plots. Resource availability to
postsettlement trees prior to thinning appeared to be greatest
in the heavily thinned plot, whereas resource availability to
presettlement trees prior to thinning was similar in all plots.
Tree Sampling
In May 2000, we haphazardly selected 12 trees in each
treatment plot for a total of 36 trees. Three trees were selected
from each of four size classes: small postsettlement (13–19
cm dbh, 14.8 m average height), medium postsettlement (23–
29 cm dbh, 17.8 m average height), large postsettlement (33–
39 cm dbh, 20.5 m average height), and presettlement (more
than 60 cm dbh, 27.4 m average height). Most postsettlement
trees in this area established in the 1919 regeneration event
(Savage et al. 1996) and therefore were approximately 80 yr
old at the time of our study. Presettlement trees in this area are
150–450 yr old (Mast et al. 1999). Selected trees had no
visible insect or physical damage and appeared disease-free.
Presettlement trees were an exception; most of them were
lightly infested with dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium spp.) in
the lower crown (Dwarf Mistletoe Rating of 1 or 2,
Hawksworth 1977).  Sampled trees in each treatment area
were located within 200 m of one another with similar slope
and aspect.
In 2001, we altered our sampling population in response to
the first year’s results because almost no characteristics of
tree water, carbon, or nutrient relations differed among the
three tree size classes of postsettlement trees in 2000 (see
results). In 2001 we measured ten presettlement trees and ten
postsettlement trees in each of the three treatment areas (n =
60 in total). Diameter at breast height of sampled
postsettlement trees in 2001 ranged between 10 and 40 cm
dbh (average height 17.7 m), and presettlement trees were
similar to those described for 2000.
Water Relations
We measured predawn (ΨPD) and midday (1100–1300
hrs; ΨMD) xylem water potential on needles of each tree in
June and August of 2000, and June and September of 2001.
ΨPD approximates soil water potential and soil water avail-
able at the root/soil interface (Kozlowski and Pallardy 1997).

June is typically the driest part of the growing season in
northern Arizona, whereas late August and early September
are at the end of the summer rainy season. For each sample
month, trees in all treatment areas were measured during 3
consecutive days, and trees in the same treatment area were
measured on 1 day. The order of measurement of treatment
areas and trees within treatment areas was determined ran-
domly for each month.
We measured water potential in the field using a pressure
chamber (Model 1000, PMS Instruments, Corvallis, OR,
USA). We clipped twigs from sunlit branches (except at
predawn) from the middle of the canopy, excised 1 yr old
needles and stored them immediately in a sealed plastic bag
with a damp paper towel. The plastic bag was immediately
placed into a dark, cool container until measurement. All
needles were measured within 1 hr of excision. This proce-
dure of sampling, storing, and measuring water potential
results in values similar to those acquired from immediate
measurements (Kaufmann and Thor 1982, T.E. Kolb, unpub-
lished data). For each tree, we measured water potential on
several needles until we obtained three values within 0.1
MPa, and we used the mean of these three values for each tree.
Leaf Gas Exchange
We measured net photosynthetic rate (Anet) and stomatal
conductance (gs) on 1 yr old needles from the same twigs cut
for water potential measurements at midmorning (0800–
1000 hr) and midday (1100–1300 hr). Measurements were
made within 1 min. of excision (Yoder et al. 1994, Feeney et
al. 1998, Stone et al. 1999) using a LI-6200 portable photo-
synthesis system (Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NE) with a 250 ml
cuvette. We measured two fascicles per tree for 30 s at high
light intensity (PAR > 800 µmol m–2 s–1). These fascicles
were then used to calculate total leaf surface area. Radii for
each needle were measured, and the average for each fascicle
was used to calculate the total surface area contained in the
cuvette (Svenson and Davis 1992).
Because Anet and gs were measured over 3 consecutive
days within a month for the three treatment areas, and trees in
each treatment area were measured on different days, appar-
ent differences in leaf gas exchange among treatments could
be confounded with differences among measurement days in
environmental factors that influence leaf gas exchange, such
as vapor pressure deficit (VPD). However, there was little
evidence of such confounding factors in our study. The order
of measurement of treatment areas within each month was
random to prevent systematic bias. Midday vapor pressure
deficit (VPD) differed among treatment areas by a maximum
of 0.48 kPa in June 2000 (overall mean = 4.18 kPa), 0.48 kPa
in August 2000 (overall mean = 3.69 kPa), 0.26 kPa in June
2001 (overall mean = 3.97 kPa), and 0.91 kPa in September
2001 (overall mean = 3.51 kPa), and no treatment area had
consistently high or low VPD. Plots of Anet and gs versus
VPD pooled over measurement times and months within
each year (e.g., Hubbard et al. 1999) revealed differences
among treatment areas (data not shown) identical to the
results of our ANOVA comparisons.
We calculated leaf-level soil-to-leaf hydraulic conduc-
tance (Kl) for each tree at midday. Kl was calculated as:

Transpiration rate

Leaf-level transpiration rate was recorded by the LI-6200
concurrently with Anet. Ψsoil was assumed to be equivalent to
ΨPD, and ΨMD was measured at the time of the transpiration
measurement (midday). We only present Kl results for 2001.
In 2000, extreme drought conditions resulted in little or no
difference between ΨPD and ΨMD and transpiration rate was
near zero in many cases; therefore many values of Kl in 2000
were close to zero.
Foliar Nitrogen and Carbon Isotope Ratio (δ13C)
We measured foliar nitrogen concentration in current-
year leaves collected in late September of 2000 and 2001
after leaf growth was complete. In late September 2000
and 2001, we sampled leaves formed in those years and
measured δ13C of whole leaf tissue. Between 0900 and
1300 hr, we excised twigs from sunlit branches in the mid-
canopy of trees with a pole-pruner or shotgun. Needles
were oven dried at 70˚C for 48 hr. We ground dried needles
in a Thomas-Wiley mill (3383-L10 series, Thomas Scien-
tific, Swedesboro, NJ) to 20 mesh. Ground samples were
analyzed for total nitrogen concentration and δ13C with a
continuous-flow mass spectrometer (Ceinstrument NC2100
and Delta Plus XL Finnigan, MAT, San Jose, CA) at the
Colorado Plateau Stable Isotope Analysis Facility, Northern
Arizona University. Nitrogen concentration was based on
leaf area (g m–2) and leaf mass (mg g–1). Hydraulic resistance
to water flow from soil to leaf may vary with path length and
affect δ13C (Walcroft et al. 1995, Warren and Adams 1999);
thus we estimated path length by measuring branch height
and length of each sampled tree with a clinometer and
logger’s tape to use as a covariate in analysis of δ13C.
However, path length was not a significant covariate with
δ13C and will not be considered henceforth.
Measurements of δ13C were made on whole leaf tissue
without pretreatment to remove cellulose because: (1) such
pretreatment typically does not change the pattern of isotopic
differences, only the absolute amount (Tans and Mook 1980,
Schleser 1992); (2) whole-tissue δ13C has been shown to be
sensitive to variations in water availability in many studies
(e.g., McNulty and Swank 1995, MacFarlane and Adams
1989, Pate 2001); (3) differences in chemical concentration
of tissues, which can bias δ13C comparisons (Ehleringer
1989, Pate 2001), among leaves from the different treatments
and years of leaf expansion in our study are assumed to be
small because all sampled leaves grew in a high light environ-
ment and were not senescent; (4) leaf whole-tissue δ13C is
largely determined by the δ13C of carbon used for leaf
synthesis because structural nonlabile carbon constitutes the
most mass of leaf tissues (Pate 2001).
Data Analysis
We used SAS JMP software (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC
USA) to perform repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA) for tree physiological data in each year with
sample month as the repeated measure and treatment, tree
size, and their interactions as factors. Years were analyzed

Forest Science 50(1) 2004
85
separately because sampled trees changed between years.
We used t-tests to compare means when factors in the
ANOVA were significant. We considered P-values less than
0.05 to be significant and values between 0.05 and 0.1 to be
marginally significant. Cost and technical constraints pre-
vented measurements on trees in true spatial replicates of all
thinning treatments. Our use of individual trees within a 17 ha
treatment plot as replicates represents pseudoreplication simi-
lar to individual plants within a greenhouse or growth cham-
ber, and may result in incorrect conclusions (Hurlbert 1984).
Whereas the scope of our study was constrained by the
design, the impact of the treatments on tree density and stand
basal area was large compared with pretreatment differences
(Table 1), and apparent effects of thinning on tree physiologi-
cal characteristics were qualitatively similar to other studies
on ponderosa pine in northern Arizona (Kolb et al. 1998,
Feeney et al. 1998, Stone et al. 1999), ensuring that the results
show treatment rather than random effects.
Results
Water Relations
Year 2001 was wetter than 2000, which was an extremely
dry year for northern Arizona. The Palmer Drought Severity
Index (PDSI; Palmer 1965) is a measure of meteorological
drought based on temperature and precipitation, with –2
indicating moderate drought, –4 indicating extreme drought,
and positive numbers indicating wet conditions. Average
yearly PDSI was –1.14 in 2001 versus –3.34 in 2000. In the
dry season (May–June), PDSI was –0.9 in 2001 versus –4.33
in 2000. In the summer rainy season (July–September), PDSI
was –0.01 in 2001 versus –5.24 in 2000 (National Climatic
Data Center).
2000 ΨPD was significantly affected by sample month,
treatment, the month × treatment interaction, and the month
× treatment × tree size interaction (Table 2). ΨPD was higher
in August than June, and higher in thinned than control
treatments (Figure 1). Year 2000 ΨMD had similar significant
sources of variation as ΨPD (Table 2). In addition, the month
× tree size interaction was marginally significant for ΨMD
(Table 2), and was due to lower ΨMD for large postsettlement
and presettlement trees than small and medium postsettlement
trees in June, whereas ΨMD did not differ among tree sizes in
August (Figure 2).
In 2001, ΨPD was again significantly affected by month,
treatment, and the month × treatment interaction (Table 2).
ΨPD in the control was lower than ΨPD in both thinned
treatments in both months sampled in 2001 (Figure 1). In
June 2001, the heavy thinning treatment had higher ΨPD than
the light thinning treatment, but in September, their ranking
was reversed (Figure 1). ΨMD in 2001 varied significantly
with month, treatment, the treatment × tree size interaction,
and the month × treatment × tree size interaction. While
statistically significant, these differences in 2001 ΨMD were
small in magnitude (<0.02 MPa).

Leaf Gas Exchange
In 2000, both midmorning and midday Anet were sig-
nificantly higher in August than June (Figure 3). Midday
Anet also varied significantly among treatments, and the
month × treatment and month × treatment × tree size
interactions were significant (Table 2). Midmorning and
midday Anet were significantly higher in both thinned
treatments than the control in June 2000, with no differ-
ence in August (Figure 3).
In year 2001, midmorning Anet was affected by month,
treatment, tree size, and the month × treatment and month ×
tree size interactions were significant (Table 2). Midmorning
Anet did not differ significantly among treatments in June
2001, but was significantly lower for the control than both
thinned treatments in September (Figure 3). Midmorning
Anet was lower in presettlement than postsettlement trees in
June, but not September 2001 (Figure 4). Midday Anet in 2001
was significantly affected by treatment, tree size, and the
month × treatment and treatment × tree size interactions
(Table 2). Midday Anet did not differ among treatments in
June 2001, but was higher in both thinned treatments than the
control in September 2001 (Figure 3). Thinning increased
midday Anet of postsettlement trees more than Anet of
presettlement trees (Figure 5).
Leaf stomatal conductance (gs) was strongly and posi-
tively correlated with Anet in 2000 (midmorning P < 0.0001,
R2 = 0.7204; midday P < 0.0001, R2 = 0.8216) and the pattern
of treatment effects was similar for Anet and gs. In year 2001,
gs did not correlate as strongly with Anet as in 2000
(midmorning P < 0.0001, R2 = 0.5250; midday P < 0.0001, R2
= 0.3245).  Midmorning gs and Anet in 2001 had similar
significant sources of variation (Table 2). Midday gs in 2001
was significantly affected by month, treatment, tree size, and
the month × treatment and month × tree size × treatment
interactions (Table 2). Midday gs was significantly higher in
June than September (Figure 6). Thinning increased midday gs

of postsettlement trees more than presettlement trees in Septem-
ber 2001 (Figure 6).
In 2001, midday Kl was significantly affected by month,
tree size, and the month × treatment and month × tree size
× treatment interactions (Table 2). For presettlement trees,
Kl did not differ among treatments in either June or
September. For postsettlement trees, Kl was higher in the
control than both thinned treatments in June, with the
opposite result in September (Figure 7).  Kl of
postsettlement trees was significantly higher than Kl of
presettlement trees in the control in June and in the light
thinning treatment in September (Figure 7).
Foliar Nitrogen and Carbon Isotope Ratio
There was no significant difference in nitrogen concentra-
tion of current-year leaves among treatments or tree size
classes in year 2000 (Table 3). Interaction between treatment
and tree size was also nonsignificant.
In year 2001, treatment was not a significant source of
variation in foliar nitrogen concentration, but tree size was
(Table 3). Presettlement trees had higher nitrogen concentra-
tion expressed on both a mass (mean = 15.1 mg g–1, SE =
0.604) and an area basis (mean =1.44 g m–2, SE = 0.082) than
postsettlement trees (mean = 13.07 mg g–1, SE = 0.615; mean
= 1.13 g m–2, SE = 0.084).
Foliar δ13C did not differ significantly among treatments
for leaves formed in 2000 and 2001 (Table 3). Tree size was
a significant source of variation for foliar δ13C in 2001, when
only two size classes were evaluated (Table 3). In 2001,
presettlement trees (mean = –25.84, SE = 0.138) had higher
foliar δ13C than postsettlement trees (mean = –26.50, SE =
0.143). Interaction between tree size and treatment effects
was not significant for either year.
Discussion
The thin and burn treatments in our study, which retained
all presettlement trees and larger postsettlement trees located
near evidence of dead presettlement trees, improved water
availability to both postsettlement and presettlement trees by
decreasing tree-to-tree competition. Tree ΨPD was higher in
the thinned and burned treatments than in the control in both
years and seasons. The greatest difference in ΨPD between
the thinned and burned treatments and the control occurred
during the period of extreme drought (June 2000). Feeney et
al. (1998) reported similar results for presettlement trees in
thinned and burned treatments versus an unthinned/unburned
control in a restoration treatment thinned in 1993 located 5
km from our study site. Kolb et al. (1998) observed this same
trend for postsettlement trees in treatments thinned to various
basal areas at another study site in close proximity to the
present study. The lowest seasonal ΨPD in these studies (–1.5
MPa, Feeney et al. 1998, –1.3 MPa, Kolb et al. 1998) was
higher than the lowest seasonal ΨPD in our study in year 2000
(–1.9 MPa). McCullough and Wagner (1987) reported ΨPD
similar to our lowest measurements (–1.8 MPa) only in
ponderosa pines that were trenched (i.e., root pruned) to
induce extreme water stress. These comparisons further
indicate that tree water stress was unusually severe in our
study in year 2000.

Our ΨPD results suggest that thinning and burning treat-
ments based on presettlement forest condition ameliorated
effects of severe drought on water uptake of both presettlement
and postsettlement trees. Such treatments might be effective
in maintaining soil water availability in ponderosa pine
forests during severe droughts predicted in the future by some
climate change models (Le Houérou 1996, Frederick and
Major 1997).
Trees in thinned and burned treatments had higher
midmorning and midday Anet than trees in the control, but
only during the driest times when ΨPD was lowest (June 2000
and September 2001). Anet did not differ among treatments
when soil water was more abundant (August 2000, June
2001). Thus, these treatments increased tree carbon acquisi-
tion in the middle of the day, especially during droughts when
low water availability and low atmospheric humidity can
result in low stomatal conductance or stomatal closure.
Higher carbon gain of trees in thinned and burned stands may
improve growth and carbon-based defenses against insects
and pathogens (Larrson et al. 1983, Kolb et al. 1998, Feeney
et al. 1998).
The light and heavy thinning had similar effects on tree
ΨPD and leaf gas exchange. For example, ΨPD did not differ
consistently between these levels of thinning, and the statis-
tically significant differences did not exceed 0.12 MPa.
Moreover, Anet did not differ significantly between the light
and heavy thinning treatments at any time. The heavy thin-
ning treatment reduced stand BA slightly more (46%) than
the light thinning (43%), and produced a lower posttreatment
BA (18 versus 22 m2 ha–1). However, these differences were
apparently too small to influence ΨPD and Anet.  Kolb et al.
(1998), at a site 1 km from our study site, reported no
differences in ΨPD or Anet of ponderosa pines between
treatments thinned to 18.4 and 27.6 m2 ha–1 except on one
measurement date, when ΨPD was higher in the treatment
with the lowest BA. Treatments studied by Kolb et al. (1998)
differed in stand BA by 9.2 m2 ha–1, whereas our light and
heavy thinning treatments differed in BA only by 5 m2 ha–1.
Thus, in many respects the “light” and “heavy” thinning
treatments in our study can be viewed as replicates of a
similar treatment, rather than distinctly different treatments.
Higher Anet of trees in the thinned and burned treatments
versus the control may have been caused by higher supply of
carbon dioxide through stomata (i.e., higher gs), as foliar N
concentration, which can influence Anet by altering levels of
photosynthetic enzymes (Reich et al. 1994, Kozlowski and
Pallardy 1997), did not differ among treatments. Low-inten-
sity prescribed fire may mineralize nitrogen stored in forest
floor litter and woody debris and increase nitrogen availabil-

ity to plants (Ryan and Covington 1986, Monleon and Cromack
1996, Grogan et al. 2000). Feeney et al. (1998) reported an
increase in nitrogen concentration in the thinned and the
thinned and burned treatments compared with an unthinned,
unburned control, for presettlement ponderosa pines at the
Gus Pearson Natural Area located near our study site. In
contrast, nitrogen concentration in leaves developed in 2000
following thinning treatments, or in 2001 following the
spring prescribed burn, did not differ among treatments in our
study.
Interestingly, foliar δ13C was not affected by thinning
treatments in 2000 or 2001. Since δ13C is often higher in trees
with lower gs (Farquhar and Lloyd 1993), the lack of treat-
ment effects on δ13C might suggest that thinning did not
affect leaf gs. However, instantaneous measurements re-
vealed that gs in 2001 was lower in the control than in the
thinned treatments in September. Foliar δ13C estimates the
relative concentration of 12C and 13C isotopes in leaf tissue,
which is influenced by leaf internal CO2 concentration and
the ratio between uptake of carbon dioxide by photosynthesis
and supply through stomata during assimilation of the carbon
used for leaf synthesis (Francey and Farquhar 1982, Farquhar
and Lloyd 1993, Pate 2001). This period of assimilation
occurs near the time of leaf growth. Consequently, δ13C in
our study provided an estimate of leaf gas exchange charac-
teristics only near the time of leaf growth, which occurred
between late June and late July in our study. Thus, results for
δ13C and gs could differ because the physiological process
that influenced each characteristic differed in not only tem-
poral scale (i.e., time-integrated versus instantaneous), but
also season timing. Moreover, the lack of variation in δ13C
among treatments may have occurred because both Anet and
gs increased in the thinned and burned treatments, leaving the
ratio of Anet/gs and leaf internal CO2 concentration un-
changed.
Presettlement and postsettlement trees differed in Anet and
responded differently to thinning and burning treatments. In
2000, our sample size (n = 3 per tree size class per treatment)
likely hindered our ability to detect tree size effects. How-
ever, in 2001 when we reduced the number of size classes of
postsettlement trees and increased sample size (n = 10 per tree
size class), Anet was consistently higher in postsettlement
than presettlement trees in the thinned treatments where Anet
and gs were not constrained by intense tree-to-tree competi-
tion. Also, stimulation of Anet and gs by the thinning and
burning treatments was greater for postsettlement than
presettlement trees.
Foliar nitrogen concentration differed between tree sizes,
but could not explain higher Anet in the smaller postsettlement
trees. Despite higher foliar nitrogen concentration in
presettlement compared to postsettlement trees in 2001, Anet
was generally lower in presettlement trees. Higher foliar
nitrogen concentration in presettlement trees may be attribut-
able to fire effects. Presettlement trees had deep layers of duff
and litter around their boles, whereas postsettlement trees
lacked these deep layers, and were surrounded by more green
grass, which did not burn. Ryan and Covington (1986) found
that increased soil nitrogen following prescribed fire was
positively correlated with litter depth before burning. Per-
haps burning of higher amounts of litter around presettlement
trees in our study increased nitrogen available to those trees
compared to postsettlement trees.
Our results suggest that lower Anet of presettlement versus
postsettlement trees resulted from a tree-size related differ-
ence in water relations, such as stomatal sensitivity to VPD,
or root-to-leaf hydraulic conductance (Hubbard et al. 1999,
Kolb and Stone 2000, Williams et al. 2001). Consistent with
this suggestion, midday leaf-level soil-to-leaf hydraulic con-
ductance (Kl) in September 2001 was higher for postsettlement
than presettlement trees in the thinned treatments, and thin-
ning stimulated Kl of postsettlement trees more than
presettlement trees at this time. This finding adds to a grow-
ing body of information suggesting that productivity of large,
old ponderosa pine trees is constrained by low Kl (Yoder et al.
1994, Hubbard et al. 1999, Williams et al. 2001). Variation in
midday Kl between years and seasons was partly due to
variation in ΨPD, since ΨMD varied little. Low Kl in year
2000 and September 2001 was associated with low ΨPD,
which reduced the gradient in water potential between soil
and leaf that drives water flow through the tree, and low gs,
which reduced transpiration rate.
Our results support earlier research by Feeney et al. (1998)
and Stone et al. (1999), which showed that thinning prescrip-
tions in northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests based on the
stand structure present before Euro-American settlement can
reduce tree-to-tree competition for water and increase physi-
ological processes sensitive to water availability, such as Anet
and gs. Such beneficial effects of thinning on presettlement
trees occur over a range of thinning intensities, ranging from
a 62% reduction in stand BA to 13 m2 ha–1 at the Gus Pearson
Natural Area (Feeney et al. 1998, Stone et al. 1999) to a 43%
reduction in stand BA to 22 m–2 ha–1 in the light thinning in
our study. Moreover, such thinning treatments in our study
had larger beneficial effects on Anet and gs of younger,
postsettlement trees than old-growth presettlement trees 1
and 2 yr after treatment, and were most pronounced during
drought.
