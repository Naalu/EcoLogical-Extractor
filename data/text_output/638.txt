Abstract.
Ecosystem stability has been of increasing interest in the past several decades as it helps
predict the consequences of anthropogenic disturbances on ecosystems. Species may exhibit stability
through compensation, with greatly fluctuating populations year to year but a consistent density response
over time. Stability is increased when species with similar functional roles compensate for one another by
responding differently to environmental change. In restoration projects, the objective is to restore stability
by altering ecosystem composition, structure, and function to resemble natural (‘‘reference’’) conditions.
We assessed the success of ecological restoration treatments by examining the structural and functional
responses of the small mammal community before and after treatment, and compared to reference
conditions. We used Royle density models to examine the responses of eight species of small mammals to
restoration (thinning) treatments in ponderosa pine forests to determine if the community maintained total
density, biomass, and function (represented by ectomycorrhizal fungi dispersion) after disturbance.
Community composition differed in each of 6 years following treatment, but total density and biomass
remained constant, suggesting the community is a stable prey base for predators. In addition, golden-
mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis) and gray-collared chipmunks (Tamias cinereicollis)
appeared to play a similar role in dispersing ectomycorrhizal fungi across different forest structures.
Both total species density and biomass were greater after thinning than in unthinned stands, and were
similar to reference stands. These results suggest that although species composition changes from year to
year after disturbance, restoration treatments can maintain ecosystem stability in terms of small mammal
community-level properties.

INTRODUCTION
Ecosystem stability has been of increasing
interest in the past several decades as it helps
predict the consequences of anthropogenic dis-
turbances on ecosystems (Walker 1995). This
may be particularly important in the context of
ecological restoration, where humans directly
alter an ecosystem with the intention of restoring
its composition, structure, and function to that
within the natural range of variability that
existed prior to human disturbance (Landres et
al. 1999). Thus, the benchmark for success in
restoration projects is the comparison of the

restored site to ‘‘natural conditions,’’ defined as
those maintained by natural processes (Society
for Ecological Restoration 2004). Although ap-
proximating natural conditions should increase
ecosystem stability, given the multiple impacts
humans have had on the landscape over the past
100 years, such as grazing, altered fire regimes,
and climate change (Westerling et al. 2006,
Bakker and Moore 2007), we cannot assume
restoration treatments will have the intended
consequences.
Compensatory population dynamics of inter-
acting species may be one mechanism for
maintaining ecosystem stability (Ernest and
Brown 2001). Resilient species are those that
rebound quickly after an environmental pertur-
bation, as they are usually small bodied and
abundant,
with
high
reproductive
outputs
(Pimm 1991). With these species, assessing
population fluctuations as a proxy for stability
may not be accurate, as they can exhibit widely
fluctuating populations year-to-year but a con-
sistent response over time. Compensation occurs
when coexisting species exhibit negative covari-
ances in population dynamics while total re-
sources use, such as total population size or
biomass, remains constant (Ernest and Brown
2001). Within a group of species with similar
functional roles, density compensation should
result in functional compensation, which is the
maintenance of ecological processes despite
changes in species composition (Frost et al.
1995). Thus, a system with compositional and
functional
compensation
would
be
able
to
maintain ecosystem functioning in the face of
environmental change (Ehrlich and Walker 1998).
Stability via compensation is difficult to test
and prove in the field due to the large demands
for data over time, and thus some of the best
examples are of zooplankton in lake acidification
experiments (Klug et al. 2000, Fischer et al. 2001).
A long-term study in the Chihuahuan desert
showed that composition of small mammal
species changes in response to disturbance, but
richness, total population size, and biomass
remain relatively constant (Ernest and Brown
2001). A similar pattern was found in Tanzania,
where
individual
ungulate
grazer
species
changed in population size over time, but overall
herbivore biomass remained constant (Prins and
Douglas-Hamilton 1990). Thus, species compen-
sation can lead to greater stability in certain
ecosystem
properties.
Species
compositional
changes are useful in assessing ecosystem stabil-
ity because it is logistically simple to count
animals; more difficult is understanding the
impacts on species’ functional roles within an
ecosystem (Naeem and Wright 2003). Further-
more, it is difficult to extrapolate predictions on
compensation from one ecosystem to another,
due to the food web effects that can come into
play (Frost et al. 1995). In the context of
ecological restoration, it is important to deter-
mine whether functional compensation is main-
tained
during
and
after
treatments
that
approximate natural disturbances, thus main-
taining ecosystem stability.
The southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus pon-
derosa) ecosystem is an ongoing experiment in
ecological restoration. Historically, ponderosa
pine forests experienced frequent disturbance
via a natural fire regime, characterized by low-
severity understory fires, with a 2–20 year
interval (Covington and Moore 1994, Fule´ et al.
1997). The resulting heterogeneity in time and
space is the natural range of variability to which
wildlife in ponderosa pine is adapted and may
depend on for long-term sustainability. Today,
the greatest threat to biological diversity is the
loss of evolutionary habitats (Noss and Csuti
1994), which is occurring in today’s ponderosa
pine forests due to fire suppression and crown
fire, which have created dense, homogenous
forest stands very different from historical
conditions (Moore et al. 1999). Thus, there is
now an emphasis on ecological restoration in the
Southwest, whereby forests are thinned to reduce
fuel loads, after which the natural fire regime can
be safely reintroduced (Covington 2003). In this
case, humans are introducing a perturbation
(thinning) in current, dense forest conditions, in
an effort to return ecosystems to more open
conditions that existed prior to Euro-American
settlement.
Small mammals commonly present in ponder-
osa pine forests of the Southwest include voles
(Microtus spp.), woodrats (Neotoma spp.), mice
(Peromyscus spp.), ground and tree squirrels
(Spermophilus and Sciurus spp.), chipmunks
(Tamias spp.), and gophers (Thomomys spp.). As
with other small mammal communities, year-to-
year changes in density are within the natural

range of variability in Arizona due to environ-
mental conditions such as drought and fire
(Brown et al. 2001), yet these species are sensitive
to
changes
in
habitat
and
are
thus
good
indicators of forest change (Converse et al.
2006). These species have several important
ecosystem functions, including acting as prey
for mammalian and avian predators, increasing
soil aeration, impacting regeneration abundance
and patterns, and dispersing fungi (Hooven
1966, Boal and Mannan 1994, Pyare and Long-
land 2001). In particular, the dispersion of
ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal spores, known as
truffles, is largely reliant on small mammals
(Johnson 1996). In this study, we examined
density responses of eight species of small
mammals to thinning (‘‘restoration’’) treatments.
We predicted that although individual species
densities would fluctuate in response to treat-
ments, total community density and biomass
would remain constant. Density compensation
among species would allow EM fungi dispersion
to occur in different habitat types by different
species at similar levels. Thus, our goal was to
assess whether community and ecosystem prop-
erties were being maintained by species compen-
sation in response to thinning in a ponderosa
pine forest, and if examining these properties
could help us ascertain whether restoration
treatments were moving the system towards
reference conditions. More specifically, our ob-
jectives were to: (1) determine if small mammal
community total density and biomass remained
constant after thinning while tradeoffs occurred
among individual species densities (demonstrat-
ing stability through compensation); (2) deter-
mine
if
the
ecosystem
function
of
fungal
dispersion remained constant after thinning
(evidence of functional compensation); and (3)
compare treated sites to both unthinned and
reference conditions to evaluate the efficacy of
restoration treatments in restoring small mam-
mal composition and function.
METHODS
Study area
The study area was located 8 km southwest of
Flagstaff, Arizona (3580903700 N, 11184303400 W), in
ponderosa pine-dominated forests. This 18,500-
ha area experienced a variety of forest manage-
ment practices, including selective harvesting
(early 1900s), commercial thinning (1970–1990s),
and fuels reduction and restoration treatments
(late 1990s–present). Within a GIS (ArcGIS v9.3,
ESRI, Redlands, California, USA), a 500-m
resolution lattice was overlaid on the study area
to locate prospective sampling points. Points that
fell within private lands and non-forested patch-
es .1 ha, or were located .500 m from a road
were eliminated. From the remaining points, 100
sampling points were randomly selected, and
then a GPS was used to locate and permanently
mark the points in the field.
Data collection
Small mammal sampling.—Each of the 100
sampling points was used as the center of a
‘‘site.’’ Centered at each site was a 5 3 5 square
trap grid which consisted of 25 Sherman (model
LNATDG, H.B Sherman Traps, Tallahassee,
Florida, USA) traps with 20-m spacing, with a 3
3 3 grid overlaid with 9 Tomahawk (model 202,
Tomahawk Live Trap, Hazelhurst, Wisconsin,
USA) traps, one at every other grid intersection.
The combination of the two trap types ensured
the majority of species in the terrestrial small
mammal community (animals that weighed
,1000 g) were captured. Total site-scale sam-
pling
area
was
14,400
m2
(1.4
ha).
Small
mammals were trapped at each site during the
summers of 2006–2009 over a 10-week period
from late June to August. Both Sherman and
Tomahawk traps were left open overnight, but
the Sherman traps were closed during the day to
prevent animals from overheating. Traps were
checked twice daily, four days per week, which
resulted in three nighttime and three daytime
trapping sessions. An open-hole test was used to
sample for Botta’s pocket gopher (Thomomys
bottae) presence; all gopher mounds located at
the site were disturbed with a shovel, and the
species was considered present if a mound was
repaired within 24 hours (Smallwood and Erick-
son 1995). We obtained Northern Arizona Uni-
versity

Care
and

Committee approval of our trapping methodol-
ogy (protocol #06–005).
Vegetation sampling.—To quantify overstory
characteristics at each site, an 11.3-m radius
circular overstory plot (400 m2) was established
at the site center, and tree species and diameter at

breast height (dbh) were measured. At the site
level, our yearly observations and state and
federal records were used to determine the age
of each treatment and the number of years slash
piles were intact. A full description of the
trapping and vegetation methods is provided in
Kalies et al. (2012).
Fungal sampling.—Fecal sampling was con-
ducted during 2007–2008. Fecal samples were
obtained directly from golden-mantled ground
squirrels and gray-collared chipmunks while in
hand. Other species were either too large to
handle or did not provide samples, and we were
unable to locate fecal samples in traps after their
capture. At each site, one or two individuals of
each of the two species were randomly chosen to
sample, however not every animal would pro-
vide a fecal sample. Between 30–40 samples per
year were chosen for analysis, and a standard
protocol (Colgan et al. 1997) was used to prepare
five slides per sample. With each slide, five fields
of view were randomly chosen under a micro-
scope in which the EM fungal spores were
counted. The total number of spores per slide
was averaged over five slides for each fecal
sample.
Analyses
Covariates.—Four covariates were used to
characterize treatments at each site: total basal
area per hectare (BA), the number of years since
thinning treatment, the number of years since
thinning that the slash piles at the site were
intact, and the number of years before the piles
were burned were also determined. Detection
histories from all 4 years of sampling were
pooled and ‘‘year’’ was used as a covariate.
Within the GIS, the UTM coordinates of each site
were obtained in order to derive a unique site-
level identifier. Principal components analysis
was used to reduce the two UTM coordinates to
one variable, similar to an interaction effect. UTM
and year were included so that any heterogeneity
due to a site or year effect would be modeled and
incorporated into the density estimates. This
resulted in a total of six habitat covariates.
Density models.—The single season density
modeling framework of Royle et al. (2005) was
used to estimate both detection probability,
defined as the probability of detecting the species
at a site if it is present, and density, defined as the
number of animals per site, for each small
mammal species. Prior to our data collection
effort and analyses, 10–15 candidate models
were constructed using the six covariates hy-
pothesized would predict density of each species
in the small mammal community. The same
covariates were used for both density and
detection probability. For each species, Program
PRESENCE
v2.4 (J.
Hines,
U.S.
Geological
Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Lau-
rel, Maryland, USA) was used to build models,
and they were compared using Akaike’s Infor-
mation Criterion adjusted for small sample sizes
(AICc; Burnham and Anderson 2002). Model
importance was ranked from highest to lowest
according to differences (D) in their AICc values.
For each species, the best model was used to
estimate density. The Appendix presents candi-
date models and selection results.
Stand structure differences.—Sampling points
were categorized by the following stand struc-
tural differences: ‘‘dense’’ stands (N ¼ 105) were
unthinned (.25 years since treatment) and
represent postsettlement or current conditions;
thinned, including stands 1–6 years post-thin-
ning (N ¼ 33, 31, 31, 19, 15, 6, respectively); and
‘‘open,’’ meadow-like stands (N ¼ 38) that were
not recently treated (.25 years) and had low BA
(,30 m2/ha), chosen as reference sites. This
resulted in a total of eight ‘‘treatments.’’ An
unbalanced PERMANOVA procedure in R (R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria) was used to test for differences in
community composition (small mammal species
richness and abundance) between treatments. An
ANOVA was used to test for differences between
treatments in total community density, total
community biomass, and mean EM spore count
per sample. When differences were found be-
tween treatments, the Tukey-Kramer Honestly
Significant Difference test was used to identify
pairwise differences. A t-test was used to
compare mean EM spore count between species
and year. For all statistical tests, a ¼ 0.05.
RESULTS
Small mammal species densities
A total of 14 sites were sampled in 2006 (pilot
year), 96 in 2007, 86 in 2008, and 83 in 2009 (n ¼
279). Each year, we detected the following

species: Mogollon vole (Microtus mogollonensis),
Mexican
woodrat
(Neotoma
mexicana),
deer
mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), tassel-eared
squirrel (Sciurus aberti), golden-mantled ground
squirrel (Spermophilus lateralis), rock squirrel
(Spermophilus variegates), gray-collared chipmunk
(Tamias cinereicollis), and Botta’s pocket gopher.
Terrestrial small mammals we could not detect
that could be fairly common in ponderosa pine
forests (USDA Forest Service 2005) included the
desert cottontail (Sylvilagus audubonii), black-
tailed jack rabbit (Lepus californicus), and dusky
shrew (Sorex monticolus).
Gray-collared chipmunks and deer mice had
the highest overall densities, while the other six
species’ densities remained near or below two
animals/ha (Fig. 1). Five species (gray-collared
chipmunk, deer mouse, golden-mantled ground
squirrel, rock squirrel, Mogollon vole) showed
increased densities in response to thinning (years
1–6), but three species (tassel-eared squirrel,
Botta’s pocket gopher, Mexican woodrat) slightly
decreased during the 6 years post-treatment (Fig.
1). All species, except rock squirrels, had higher
densities in the open treatment compared to the
dense treatment.
Community density and biomass
Total density and biomass were significantly
different between treatments (P , 0.0001 and P ¼
0.0002, respectively); but pairwise comparisons
indicated that only the dense treatment was
significantly different from other treatments
(Table 1). The dense treatment had the lowest
total density, but following treatment, total
community density remained relatively constant
at 15–17 animals/ha (Fig. 2). Total community
biomass was significantly different between the
dense treatments and year 1, but all other
treatments were statistically similar to both the
dense and year 1 treatments (Fig. 2). However,
community composition was significantly differ-
ent in each of the eight treatments (P ¼ 0.0001),
with significant differences between 24 of 28
pairs (Table 1).
Fungal dispersal potential
A total of 65 fecal samples (gray collared-
chipmunk, N ¼ 44; golden-mantled ground
squirrel, N ¼ 21) were analyzed for mean EM
spore count. There was no significant difference
in mean EM spore count between treatments (P ¼
0.97) or species (P ¼ 0.07), but there was between
years (P ¼ 0.0007).
DISCUSSION
Community structural responses to disturbance
Following thinning and reduction of basal
area, ponderosa pine forests experience an
increase in understory vegetation in terms of
cover and diversity in as little as 2 years post-
treatment (Moore et al. 2006). In addition, down
wood (slash) is usually left onsite for 1–2 years
before being burned, adding a source of cover to
an otherwise disturbed site. Our study captured
these short-term successional changes (years 1–6
post-thinning) but not the long-term changes that
would occur over a longer (;20 year) fire return
interval. Nevertheless, species density tradeoffs
occurred following thinning treatments. We
expected similar responses from the generalist
gray-collared chipmunks and deer mice, which
are usually found at high densities across
different forest structural conditions (Bagne and
Finch 2009), but the chipmunks responded more
positively than deer mice immediately post-
disturbance, likely due to the slash component.
We observed opposite responses by tassel-eared
squirrels and golden-mantled ground squirrels,
as the former is associated with mature pine trees
for nesting and foraging (Patton 1977), while the
latter uses open meadow-like habitat (Bartels and
Thompson 1993); and by woodrats and voles, as
woodrats are associated with shrub cover and
down wood (Block et al. 2005), while voles use
meadow-like understory (Bagne and Finch 2009).
Overall, six species responded positively to the
disturbance event, which is logical given that
ponderosa pine forests and its species historically
experienced the natural disturbance of fire every
2–20 years (Covington and Moore 1994), and
thinning and fire can effect some habitat features
(i.e., understory production) in similar ways
(Moore et al. 2006, Schwilk et al. 2009). Two
species responded negatively to thinning, includ-
ing woodrats, which probably experienced a lack
of cover at the thinned sites, and pocket gophers,
which may have been negatively affected by the
soil compaction associated with thinning. Tassel-
eared squirrel densities remained fairly constant
following thinning, which was contrary to past

research suggesting that restoration treatments
will have negative consequences (Dodd et al.
2003, Dodd et al. 2006); however, tassel-eared
squirrels might be more closely linked to large-
diameter trees (Patton 1977, Kalies et al. 2012)
which are retained in thinning treatments and do
not change in density or size in the short term.
Thus, species densities fluctuated in response to
various habitat elements, but total community
density remained constant following distur-
bance, indicating that the community remained
stable through compensation.
Community functional responses to disturbance
Biomass is both a measure of ecosystem
stability, as well as an indicator of the amount
of prey available to predators, which is an
important function of the small mammal com-
munity. Through a concurrent study, we ob-
served that coyotes (Canis latrans) and gray foxes

(Urocyon cinereoargenteus) commonly used our
sites, and raccoons (Procyon lotor) and ringtails
(Bassariscus astutus) were occasional visitors
(Barrett et al. 2012). These predators tend to be
prey generalists (Hoffmeister 1986), and thus
likely would not be negatively affected by
changes in species composition so long as
adequate prey biomass was available. We found
that biomass remained constant following treat-
ment, suggesting that small mammals continued
to provide this function and at similar levels as
those at reference sites. However, without mea-
surements of predator density or occurrence
following treatments, we cannot confirm that
this ecosystem function is being maintained. For
example, avian predators are also likely present
at our sites, and some species such as the
federally threatened Mexican spotted owl (Strix
occidentalis lucida) may have preferences for
specific prey species (e.g., woodrats; Ganey
1992), and thus could be negatively affected by
fluctuations in individual species’ densities. In
addition, we were unable to trap rabbits during
our study, which can be an important prey item
for mammalian and avian predators (Fritzell and
Haroldson 1982, Boal and Mannan 1994).
In an effort to evaluate another functional role
of the small mammal community, we quantified
EM spores found in small mammal feces. Due to
the physical size of truffles, only animals such as
ungulates, mammals, or turkeys can unearth
them, and thus their dispersal may be limited by
the presence of these animals, although this has
not been empirically proven (Johnson 1996). In
addition, although animals may release spores
into the air when preying upon the truffle,
probably of greater importance is that spores
are ingested and dispersed via feces (Johnson
1996). Several studies showed not only that
spores are viable after passing through the
animals’ guts, but this process may actually
promote germination (Kotter and Farentinos
1984, Cork and Kenagy 1989). We found that
mean EM spore counts in the feces of two species
of small mammals remained constant across
treatments. Korb et al. (2003) showed that

restoration treatments in ponderosa pine forests
did not decrease the relative amount of EM fungi
propagules compared to unmanaged sites, and
thus
we
assume
that
EM
availability
was
relatively constant. Although all species in our
community can potentially disperse EM fungi
(with the possible exception of the deer mouse;
Pyare and Longland 2001), we showed that
golden-mantled ground squirrels and gray-col-
lared chipmunks carried similar amounts of EM
spores in their feces. We were particularly
interested in these species because they were
found to be major players in consuming truffles
in other systems (Pyare and Longland 2001) and
were the most abundant small mammals in our
study (excluding deer mice). Furthermore, we
wanted to understand the role of species associ-
ated with open forest structure, because abun-
dant research on tassel-eared squirrels confirms
that the species disperses EM fungi and suggests
the role is tied to dense forest conditions (Kotter
and Farentinos 1984, States et al. 1988, Dodd et
al. 2003). Thus, golden-mantled ground squirrels,
chipmunks, and tassel-eared squirrels may com-
pensate
for one
another in providing this
ecosystem function. However, the presence of
EM fungi in the feces of small mammals only
confirms their potential to disperse fungi; we
were unable to measure EM fungi presence or
availability following treatments. In addition, we
were unable to quantify EM spore counts for the
less abundant species that could disperse truffles,
including rock squirrels, pocket gophers, voles,
and
woodrats.
Finally,
we
examined
fungi
abundance but not diversity, and other studies
suggest that small mammal species may not play
functionally redundant roles in terms of the
species of fungi they disperse (Pyare and Long-
land 2001).
Implications for ecological restoration
Three species that decreased in density after
thinning (Mexican woodrat, tassel-eared squirrel,
Botta’s pocket gopher) reached their highest
densities at reference stands, suggesting that if
restoration treatments can achieve this desired
endpoint, it will benefit these species despite
short-term losses. Furthermore, although total
biomass was relatively constant across all treat-
ments, total density was higher in reference than
dense sites. However, community composition
differed among years, and was significantly
different in reference sites compared with each
year of thinning; thus, we have no evidence that
the thinning treatments will eventually produce
community compositions that emulate natural
conditions. In addition, while the open stands
provide a reference point by which to judge the
effectiveness of treatments, these stand structures
differ from true natural conditions. Due to
logging near Flagstaff during the late 1800s, trees
at our study sites tended to be small (less than
2% of the trees we measured were 60 cm in
diameter) unlike natural conditions which con-
tained low densities of large trees (approximately
10% were 60 cm in diameter; Fule´ et al. 1997).
Relict sites with intact fire history would be a
better indicator of ‘‘natural’’ communities than
the sites we sampled. Thus, our results suggest
that restoration treatments are maintaining small
mammal community-level properties, but it is
unclear if community composition is on a
trajectory toward restoration in the long term.
