Abstract: Remotely-sensed data are commonly used to evaluate forest metrics, such as canopy cover,
to assess change detection, and to inform land management planning. Often, canopy cover is measured
only at the scale of the spatial data product used in the analysis, and there is a mismatch between the
management question and the scale of the data. We compared four readily available remotely sensed
landscape data products— Light detection and ranging (LiDAR), Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and National
Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery —at diﬀerent spatial grains and multiple extents to
assess their consistency and eﬃcacy for quantifying key landscape characteristics of forest canopy
patches and sensitivity to change. We examined landscape-scale patterns of forest canopy cover
across three landscapes in northern Arizona and assessed their performance using six landscape
metrics. Changes in grain and extent aﬀect canopy cover patch metrics and the inferences that can be
made from each data product. Overall data products performed diﬀerently across landscape metrics.
When performing analyses and choosing data layers, it is essential to match the scale of the data
product to the management question and understand the limitations inherent in using canopy cover
as a stand-alone metric.

1. Introduction
United States federal land management agencies are directed to manage national forests to promote
resilient landscapes, deﬁned as within their natural range of variability [1]. Public lands in the western
US require restoration to address the uncharacteristic current conditions, such as high tree densities,
high fuel loads, bark beetle infestations, and subsequent high ﬁre hazard [1–3]. Currently, forests
are subject to a variety of disturbances, including large wildﬁres, insects, pathogens, and post-ﬁre
ﬂooding. While these disturbances were always components of the historical ecosystem, they are now
strongly inﬂuenced by human activities and climate change and uncharacteristic disturbances have
become more frequent, higher in intensity, and cover larger areas than historically [4,5]. USDA Forest
Service restoration goals need to be accomplished at an accelerated pace to maintain resiliency [6–8].
In addition, public lands have seen both leadership direction and political pressure to include increased
participation in planning and decision making from multiple agencies and stakeholders [9]. As a
result, both land managers and stakeholders are interested in understanding landscape-level processes
at scales appropriate to planning and implementation and quantifying metrics that are indicative of
resilient and restored ecosystems that capture the natural range of variability.

Understanding spatial and temporal patterns in forested landscapes is an important component of
ecosystem complexity and forest ecology. However, these are diﬃcult concepts to quantify and capture
for land management practitioners and non-technical stakeholders [10–12]. Forests are composed of a
mosaic of patches, diﬀering in their structure, shape, and spatial arrangement, and these patterns aﬀect
overall ecological processes [10,13,14]. Adjacent patches interact with one another to compose the
larger landscape and inﬂuence landscape patterns and processes at larger scales, yet forest management
historically has been done on traditional, stand-level scales. Recent work examining the distribution and
proportion of forest attributes across the landscape informs questions concerning forest restoration and
resilience, wildﬁre, hydrology, and wildlife habitat management [10,13], but is not fully incorporated
into land management planning and active management.
Quantifying spatial heterogeneity of forest structure can be used as a tool to measure the ecological
integrity of a system and forest structural and compositional complexity. Scale is an important
component of our ecological view of the landscape. Metrics used to describe forest structure, and spatial
heterogeneity of a landscape will vary dependent on the scale at which they are examined [10,15].
Scale within a landscape context can be deﬁned in terms of both grain and extent [15–17]. The spatial
grain of the landscape is the smallest resolution of the data. Extent is the overall size of the landscape
or area encompassed by the observation. Extent and grain determine the upper and lower limits of the
observation, and changes in both grain and extent aﬀect the patterns detected and the inferences we
make. Canopy cover is a metric that is widely used in modeling species habitat relationships, spatial
patterns, fragmentation, forest resilience, stand density and many other areas of interest [13,18,19].
It has also been used in land management direction as a surrogate for wildlife habitat quality. However,
canopy cover is measured or extracted in multiple ways at multiple spatial scales and extents that can
vary by the user-deﬁned parameters. Often this metric is used without explicitly deﬁning how canopy
cover was measured or classiﬁed.
Remote sensing is an eﬀective tool for understanding current landscape conditions, monitoring
forest change, and understanding how forest ecosystems respond to disturbances. The advancement
in technology and available data sources provide a means to assess a range of spatial information and
real-time data, conduct surveys, and provide continuous data sources across large landscapes [20].
There is often a lack of spatially explicit data that characterize forest heterogeneity at multiple scales.
In many cases, ﬁeld or ground data are not readily available, they are time-consuming and costly to
collect, and are often not spatially replicated across large areas or available at the scale of the analysis.
Therefore, using readily available and spatially explicit remotely sensed data products can aid in
elucidating landscape patterns of canopy cover and other forest structure metrics when ﬁeld data
are not available or not feasible. Remotely sensed data products can provide spatially continuous
information with higher eﬃciency and lower cost.
Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has become increasingly useful in the three-dimensional
characterization of forest canopy and other forest attributes such as stand structure, biomass, and tree
density [21,22]. Airborne LiDAR data can be used to characterize tree-level forest structure and
over large areas [23,24], and individual-tree detection methods can be used to characterize forest
structure, tree spatial patterns, and canopy metrics [25,26]. Additionally, LiDAR can provide accurate,
high-resolution descriptions of overstory structure and patterns with high accuracy at multiple
scales [27].
Remotely sensed data, coupled with ﬁeld observations, can be an important data source to support
the monitoring of forest restoration via mechanical thinning and burning treatments and provide
baseline forest inventory data where there is none. This study examines readily available remotely
sensed landscape data products to assess their consistency and eﬃcacy for quantifying key landscape
characteristics of forest canopy patches and sensitivity to change due to forest management actions
or diversity. In this analysis, we compared four remotely sensed data products at diﬀerent spatial
grains and multiple spatial extents to examine landscape-scale patterns of forest canopy cover across
three landscapes in northern Arizona, USA. Our objectives were to observe how changes in grain and

Forests 2019, 10, 465

extent aﬀect canopy cover patch characteristics. We speciﬁcally asked: 1) How do readily available
and repeatable remotely sensed products—Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, the National Agriculture Imagery
Program, and LiDAR—that are at diﬀerent spatial grains compare in their ability to accurately predict
canopy cover, and 2) how do forest canopy patch metrics vary across remotely sensed data products
and spatial extents?
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Area
We examined landscape patterns of canopy cover across three ponderosa pine/gambel oak
(Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum Engelm./Quercus gambelii Nutt.) forests spanning a gradient of
intact, un-managed ponderosa pine forest to a highly managed forest in northern Arizona, USA.
Our three landscapes were Powell Plateau and Tepeats Creek near the North Rim of the Grand Canyon,
and Windmill Draw/Jacks Canyon located on the Mogollon Rim (Figure 1). Powell Plateau (~1800 ha
in size) represents a relict landscape of ponderosa pine and oak on limestone soils that has remained a
relatively intact, functional landscape with a natural ﬁre disturbance history into the 20th century [28].
Tepeats Creek (~2100 ha) represents a ponderosa pine and oak forest on limestone soils with ﬁre
exclusion and timber management since the late 19th century, and Windmill Draw/Jacks Canyon
(~2400 ha, hereafter referred to as “Windmill Draw”) represents a ponderosa pine and oak forest on
basalt soils with ﬁre exclusion and timber management since the late 19th century, both typical of
current southwestern forest conditions [29].

North Rim of the Grand Canyon, and Windmill Draw/Jacks Canyon on the Mogollon Rim.
2.2. Remotely Sensed Data
We used remotely sensed data from four sources to examine patterns of canopy cover across
our three study landscapes. We used Landsat-8 data (30 m cell resolution), Sentinel-2 data (10 m
cell resolution), orthographic aerial imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP)
(1 m cell resolution), and aerial LiDAR data (1 m cell resolution) across our three landscapes. In this
analysis, we compared landscape metrics calculated from these four spatial products (i.e., diﬀerent

Forests 2019, 10, 465
4 of 21
grains—Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, NAIP, and LiDAR) and then make comparisons across landscapes.
The Landsat and Sentinel data are easily available to land management agencies and are released
relatively often, while NAIP imagery is released every two to four years depending on location. LiDAR,
although more accurate, is currently at a higher cost and ﬂown by individual agencies or coalitions
of natural resource management stakeholders. Currently, it is not consistently collected across the
nation, but the USGS 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) has set a goal to complete nationwide LiDAR data
coverage by 2023 [30]. Our objective was to address how remotely sensed canopy cover patch metrics
vary over multiple spatial extents and how the grain (cell resolution) of normally used products aﬀects
landscape metrics commonly used to assess restoration success, and thus, patterns detected.
Airborne LiDAR data were used to create a digital elevation model (DEM), digital surface model
(DSM), and a canopy height model (CHM) for each site at 1 m spatial resolution. The Airborne LiDAR
data were collected over two acquisition periods, August–Sept 2012 for Powell and Tepeats Creek and
August–Sept 2013 for Windmill Draw. The data were requisitioned by the USDA Forest Service and
acquired by Quantum Spatial using Leica ALS50 Phase II and ALS60 systems either dual mounted
or separately in a Cessna Caravan and a Partenavia ﬁxed-wing aircraft, respectively. The sensor
was ﬂown at an altitude of 900 m aboveground with ≥50% side-lap (≥100% overlap), resulting in an
average volumetric point-density of ≥8 pulses per m2. These data were then classiﬁed as ground or
non-ground by the vendor using TerraScan v.12.004 and v.13.008, which uses the Axelsson algorithm
to classify the DTM points [31]. The horizontal and vertical positioning errors in the point cloud data
were ≤15 cm. Resulting CHM pixels above 2 m were classiﬁed as either canopy or not canopy, with no
eﬀort undertaken to diﬀerentiate between deciduous and coniferous vegetation.
Additionally, we utilized National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery collected for
Arizona in 2015. This imagery is available free via Google Earth Engine (GEE) [32] and includes four
bands (red, green, blue, and infrared) with a 1 m ground sample distance. At a minimum, the horizontal
accuracy of the imagery must be within 6 m and cloud cover must be less than 10% per quarter USGS
topographic quadrangle tile. NAIP Imagery was loaded into R (https://www.r-project.org/) using
the raster package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster) and a ratio band was calculated
by dividing the near-infrared and red (bands 4 and 1, respectively) [33]. The ratio band was merged
with the red, green, blue, and near-infrared bands. Test classiﬁcations indicated that 25 classes limited
confusion between tree canopy and forest openings and a 25-class unsupervised classiﬁcation was
run using the RStoolbox package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RStoolbox) and then each
class was evaluated by overlaying with LiDAR CHM to verify canopy and not canopy classes. We
then classiﬁed the resulting layer into a binary map of canopy and not canopy cover at 1 m spatial
resolution and georeferenced this layer to the LiDAR CHM. We then generated 1000 random points
within each landscape and performed an accuracy assessment using the LiDAR classiﬁed canopy and
not canopy image as truth. Resulting overall classiﬁcation accuracies were 63.3%, 61.8%, and 76.3% for
Powell, Tepeats Creek, and Windmill Draw areas, respectively.
Sentinel-2 is part of the Copernicus Earth Observation Program of the European Union. We utilized
cloud-free (<10%) fall imagery (October 2015 for Windmill Draw and August 2016 for Powell plateau
and Tepeats Creek) from Sentinel-2 were used to characterize canopy cover across the study area.
The satellite is equipped with a wide swath multi spectral instrument (MSI) which collects near-nadir
imagery in 13 spectral bands (coastal aerosol, red, green, blue, three red edge, two near-infrared,
water vapor and three shortwave infrared) ranging from 10 to 60 m resolution [34].
For this
study, we used the 10 m resolution visible, and near-infrared bands and each Sentinel-2 image was
atmospherically corrected to bottom of atmosphere reﬂectance using the Sen2Cor algorithm provided
by the European Space Agency Sentinel Application Platform [35]. Using the same approach as we
used with the NAIP imagery, we performed a 25-class unsupervised classiﬁcation, with the resulting
image being reclassiﬁed into a binary map of canopy and not canopy cover at 10 m spatial resolution.
To perform an accuracy assessment with this product, we aggregated the LiDAR canopy and not canopy
image to 10 m using the raster package and reclassiﬁed pixels to canopy where ≥50% (an approximate

non-linear interpolation based on the FAO classiﬁcation using 10% cover at 0.5 ha [36], Hansen et al.’s
classiﬁcation of cover using 25% at 30 m [37], and an assumed 90% cover at 1 m for LiDAR) of the
LiDAR canopy image pixels were classiﬁed as canopy. This layer was then compared to the classiﬁed
Sentinel-2 canopy image using 1000 randomly generated points and resulting overall classiﬁcation
accuracies were 72.4%, 56.8%, and 63.1% for Powell, Tepeats Creek and Windmill Draw, respectively.
Lastly, Landsat-8 imagery was used to assess canopy cover at the coarsest grain, 30 m spatial
resolution. We obtained Landsat-8 operational land imagery from the fall (October–November) 2015.
These images contain seven bands (ﬁve visible and near-infrared bands and two short-wave infrared)
processed to orthorectiﬁed surface reﬂectance by GEE using the Landsat surface reﬂectance code
(LaSRC), which makes use of the coastal aerosol band to perform aerosol inversion tests, uses auxiliary
climate data from MODIS, and uses a unique radiative transfer model. We used a cloud, cloud-shadow,
and cirrus cloud mask included in the SR data using CFMASK [38]. As with the other products,
we performed a 25-class unsupervised classiﬁcation, with the resulting image being reclassiﬁed into
a binary map of canopy and not canopy cover at 30 m spatial resolution. To perform an accuracy
assessment with this product, we aggregated the LiDAR canopy and not canopy image to 30 m using
the raster package and reclassiﬁed pixels to canopy where ≥25% [37] of the LiDAR canopy image
pixels were classiﬁed as canopy. This layer was then compared to the classiﬁed Landsat-8 canopy
image using 1000 randomly generate points and resulting overall classiﬁcation accuracies were 74.6%,
69.3%, and 85.3% for Powell, Tepeats Creek, and Windmill Draw, respectively.
2.3. Use of LiDAR as Reference Data
Airborne LiDAR is a widely accepted method of collecting and generating precise, georeferenced
spatial information about features of the earth’s surface, shape, and physical characteristics [39].
Recent advances have produced mapping technologies that allow scientists to examine environmental
features such as forests, watersheds, and ecosystem attributes with accuracy and precision [39].
LiDAR technology provides horizontal and vertical information at high spatial resolution and vertical
accuracies. It has been used to accurately assess forest canopy metrics and other forest attributes
such as stand structure, biomass, and tree density [21,22]. LiDAR provides very detailed, wall-to-wall
maps of forest canopy cover (via reclassiﬁcation of the CHM to cover/not cover binary maps) that
are problematic and laborious to produce with traditional ﬁeld and photointerpretation methods.
Furthermore, validating the accuracy of LiDAR-derived canopy cover using highly uncertain ﬁeld
observations should be avoided, as the results of ocular and vertical sighting methods are prone to
sampling problems and are diﬃcult to conﬁrm [40]. As a result of these uncertainties, LiDAR-derived
canopy cover maps are increasingly being used as reference data for assessing accuracies of alternative
methods, which typically show agreement with LiDAR-derived canopy cover estimates but are subject
to high levels of bias (underestimate low and to overestimate high canopy cover) and imprecision [41–43].
Given that LiDAR-derived estimates are continuous and high resolution, making them useful in forest
monitoring and management, we chose to use LiDAR-derived metrics as reference data and compare
the performance of the three other spatially derived products to LiDAR.
For each landscape, the four data products that vary in grain (Landsat-8 30 m, Sentinel-2 10 m,
NAIP 1 m, and LiDAR 1 m) were compared over multiple spatial extents (Figure 2). For all four
data products, each patch was delineated by contiguous pixels of canopy cover, and we used the
eight neighbor rule for cell-based indices- meaning contiguous cells were deﬁned as those that were
either directly or adjacently contiguous. After classiﬁcation of each data layer into canopy/not canopy,
we used landscape metrics to quantify key characteristics of forest canopy patches and to quantify forest
cover patterns and make comparisons among diﬀerent landscapes. A total of six patch metrics were
examined to explain the variability of patches across landscapes of diﬀerent extent (Table 1). With our
simple binary classiﬁcation, the proportion of landscape (PLand), patch density (PD), and mean patch
area (MPA) are basic descriptors of the canopy distribution. These characteristics inform the descriptors

Forests 2019, 10, 465

of spatial connectedness and distribution, including the aggregation index (AI), patch cohesion index
(PCI), and landscape division index (LDI).

Metric
•
PLand (proportion of landscape) is the total proportion of the patch—canopy cover—across each landscape.
•
PD (patch density) is the number of patches of canopy cover per unit area, hectares in this analysis.
•
MPA (mean patch area) is the average area of patches (ha) composed of canopy cover across each landscape.
•
AI (aggregation index) is the area of canopy cover on the landscape that has like adjacencies of canopy
clumped into a compact patch and is weighted proportionally by its area in the landscape. It is a landscape
metric of how aggregated canopy cover is at each extent.
•
PCI (patch cohesion index) is a connectivity metric that measures the physical connectedness of the
corresponding patch type. Patch cohesion increases as canopy cover becomes more clumped or aggregated in
its distribution and more physically connected.
•
LDI (landscape division index) is the probability that two randomly chosen pixels in the landscape are not
in the same patch and is based on the cumulative patch area distribution. The sum is across the proportional
area of each patch of canopy cover.
For each landscape and each remote sensing product, we performed a landscape pattern analysis
of canopy cover using the SDM Tool package (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SDMTools)
in R (R Studio https://www.r-project.org/).
SDM Tools calculates landscape metrics (similar to
FRAGSTATS [44]) and outputs values for each metric. We sampled each landscape metric across ﬁve
to seven diﬀerent spatial extents: 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 300, 600, 1000 ha. We performed 100 Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations to sample each landscape at these multiple extents. Our three

Forests 2019, 10, 465
7 of 21
landscapes varied in size, therefore, all three landscapes did not get sampled at the largest extents.
Powell Plateau was sampled 10 ha–300 ha, Tepeats Creek was sampled 10 ha–600 ha, and Windmill
Draw was sampled 10 ha–1000 ha (Figure 2).
3. Results
General patterns of patch characteristics were observed across spatial extents and between the four
data products (Landsat-8 30 m, Sentinel-2 10 m, NAIP 1 m, LiDAR 1 m) that match our understanding of
expected changes of patches with scale and grain. This study more speciﬁcally tested readily available
remotely sensed data products to assess their consistency and eﬃcacy for quantifying key characteristics
of forest canopy and sensitivity to change due to forest management or diversity. Here we report the
diﬀerences in data products (grain) and how the patterns change across spatial extents.
3.1. Ability of the Four Spatial Products (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, NAIP, and LiDAR) to Predict Metrics of
Canopy Cover
The proportion of landscape (PLand) comprised of canopy cover was underpredicted by NAIP
and overpredicted by Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 across our three landscapes. PLand was best predicted
by the Sentinel-2 data (10 m), which produced means most similar to the LiDAR data (1 m) on Powell
Plateau, our remnant functional landscape with an intact natural disturbance regime (Table 2, Figure 3).
NAIP (1 m), while still underestimated, eﬀective1y best characterized PLand on Windmill Draw,
a highly managed forest landscape experiencing both ﬁre exclusion and extensive timber management.
Landsat-8 (30 m) overestimated PLand on all three landscapes.

Figure 3. Violin plots (colored by extent and depicting probability density of the data at diﬀerent values

(Landsat-8 30 m, Sentinel-2 10 m, NAIP 1 m, LiDAR 1 m), and across multiple spatial extents. Insets
with rescaled y-axis provided for clarity.
The number of patches of canopy cover, or patch density (PD), was not accurately predicted
by any of our spatial products across landscapes or spatial extents. NAIP at 1 m resolution highly
over-predicted the patch density by 2.5 to 3 times across all three landscapes (Table 3, Figure 4).
The small pixel size can fragment patches that the LiDAR point cloud keeps aggregated, thus resulting
in many more patches across the landscape, at all extents. Landsat (30 m) and Sentinel-2 (10 m) highly
underestimated PD at their native cell resolutions. Mean Patch Area (MPA), the average area composed
of patches of canopy cover, was highly overestimated (one to two orders of magnitude) by Landsat
and Sentinel-2 as compared to LiDAR (Table 4, Figure 5). NAIP underestimated mean patch area by
three to four times on all landscapes across all spatial extents.

Canopy cover was highly aggregated, an attribute that was detected by all four data products
across all spatial extents sampled (Figure 6). Sentinel-2 was able to detect aggregation more accurately
on Tepeats Creek and Windmill Draw, but under-predicted aggregation on Powell Plateau. Landsat-8
best predicted aggregation on Windmill Draw, and under-predicted aggregation on Tepeats Creek and
Powell Plateau (Table 5, Figure 6). NAIP under-estimated aggregation on all three landscapes and
across all extents, especially on Powell Plateau.

All three landscapes had a high patch cohesion index and high physical patch connectivity of
canopy cover across all four data grains and across all spatial extents (Figure 7, Table 6). Patch cohesion
is sensitive to aggregation of canopy cover and increases as canopy cover becomes more clumped or
aggregated in its distribution. NAIP and Sentinel-2 most accurately predicted patch cohesion on all
three landscapes across all extents, while Landsat-8 consistently and increasingly under-predicted
patch cohesion at extents 50 ha and smaller (Table 6).
Figure 7. Violin plots (colored by extent and depicting probability density of the data at diﬀerent values
smoothed by a kernel density estimator), box-and-whisker plots (black and white) and mean (red dot)

canopy cover for each landscape and data product (Landsat-8 30 m, Sentinel-2 10 m, NAIP 1 m, LiDAR
1 m), and across multiple spatial extents. Insets with rescaled y-axis provided for clarity.

Landscape division index was best predicted by NAIP, especially on Powell Plateau and Windmill
Draw, but poorly captured within-extent variability (Figure 8, Table 7). Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 highly
under-predicted LDI by two to four times across all landscapes and extents. NAIP over-estimated LDI
on Powell Plateau, but performed well at larger spatial extents 300 ha and 600, and 1000 ha on Tepeats
Creek and Windmill Draw (Table 7).

3.2. Forest Canopy Patch Metrics across Remotely-Sensed Data Product, Landscape, and Extent
We examined how patch metrics varied across the landscapes and extents for each data product.
PLand varied across landscapes and extent for all four spatial products. In addition to the median and
mean values, the ability to capture the variability on the landscape is important to both land managers
and stakeholders. For this metric, there was little observed variability at extents larger than 300 ha
and was best observed using extents smaller than 75 ha or 100 ha (Table 2, Figure 3). The values of
the PLand varied across landscapes. However, not consistently across remotely sensed products and
spatial grain. The LiDAR data product showed similar canopy cover across Tepeats Creek and Powell
Plateau, with lower values at Windmill Draw. Conversely, the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data products
both had the highest canopy cover at Windmill Draw. NAIP at 1 m resolution underestimated PLand
at Powell Plateau across all spatial extents.
We standardized patch density (PD) by area in hectares (Figure 4). There were consistent patterns
of high overestimation of PD by NAIP, and high underestimation of PD by Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8
compared to LiDAR. On Powell Plateau at 100 ha extent, LiDAR predicted 12.4 patches, while NAIP
predicted 52.7 patches, Landsat-8 predicted 0.06 patches, and Sentinel-2 predicted 0.59 patches (Table 3).
Patch density of both single trees or groups of trees are categorized as a patch, and in these forests
canopy patches on the landscape were dominated by many small patches. This trend was steady
across all spatial extents. The metric was ampliﬁed by a higher number of small trees and density
decreased by the area sampled. For both LiDAR and NAIP, patch density was not sensitive to the
extent measured. However, using Landsat-8 data (30 m grain) and Sentinel-2 data (10 m grain), patch
density decreased with spatial extent by nearly an order of magnitude from smallest (10 ha) to largest
(300 ha). This correlates with the inability of these spatial products at those spatial grains to detect
small patches. Landsat-8-derived patch density at a 10-ha extent was limited by this extent and showed
higher patch density.
Patch density (PD) and mean patch area (MPA) are closely related, and remotely sensed products
with high PD will have lower MPA. For example, On Tepeats Creek at 50 ha extent, LiDAR predicted
the mean patch area to be 0.046 ha in size, NAIP predicted it to be 0.006 ha in size, Sentinel-2 predicted
1.096 and Landsat-8 predicted 13.9 ha in size (Table 4, Figure 5). The eﬀect of extent was similar to the
patterns in PD: Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data had an increasing MPA with an increased spatial extent
on all three landscapes, which was expected due to the larger cell resolution that samples the data.
NAIP and LiDAR showed little sensitivity to spatial extents (Table 4).
Aggregation (AI) was high on all three landscapes (Figure 6, Table 5), and varied little across
all landscapes as estimated using LiDAR (i.e., reported standard errors ranged from 0.001 to 0.192).
The NAIP had consistently lower AI values than the other products on Tepeats and Windmill Draw
areas. This was directly related to the native cell resolution of NAIP at 1 m, the high PD and low
MPA. Landscape Aggregation was well estimated using the Landsat-8 data. This was due to the larger
cell resolution (30 m), which tended to form more contiguous patches. NAIP at 1 m cell resolution

Forests 2019, 10, 465
16 of 21
detected more discrete single patches that are not aggregated. At the landscape-scale, NAIP at 1 m cell
resolution under-predicted aggregation. All products were consistent across extents, showing little
sensitivity to extent.
Patch Cohesion (PC) increased as canopy cover became more clumped or aggregated in its
distribution, and therefore more physically connected. All three landscapes had a high patch cohesion,
consistent with the aggregation index and supporting the observation that canopy cover was highly
connected. This pattern was found across all products and landscapes (Figure 7, Table 6). Although
NAIP had much diﬀerent values than LiDAR on patch description metrics (PLand, PD, MPA), for patch
cohesion, it was more similar to LiDAR on all three landscapes and across all extents. Sentinel-2
performed well at estimating patch cohesion across all spatial extents (Table 6). Landsat-8 consistently
under-predicted patch cohesion at smaller extents (10–25 ha) and was more accurate at predicting
patch cohesion at ≥100 ha (Table 6). Patch cohesion was sensitive to the aggregation of canopy cover
and increased as canopy cover becomes more clustered or aggregated in its distribution.
Landscape division index (LDI) is the probability that two randomly chosen pixels in the landscape
are not in the same patch and is based on the cumulative patch area distribution. NAIP had a high
probability of landscape division across all spatial extents as it tended to break up large patches
into many smaller patches, yet it was accurate on Windmill Draw (Table 7). Landsat-8 had a lower
probability of LDI because it measured canopy cover across the landscape as a smaller number of
larger sized patches. The four data products displayed variability of patterns across spatial extents
due to their native cell resolutions. NAIP showed consistent unimodal distributions of LDI at smaller
extents. LiDAR only showed this at the Windmill Draw landscape.
4. Discussion
This analysis provided insights into remotely sensed data products, their native cell resolutions
(grain), and how metrics can describe patch and landscape characteristics of canopy cover. We examined
six forest canopy patch metrics and described their diﬀerences across data products (Landsat-8 30 m,
Sentinel-2 10 m, NAIP 1 m, and LiDAR 1 m), spatial extent, and among study landscapes. LiDAR
was used as a reference for evaluating landscapes, as well as for assessing the accuracy of the other
products. In the United States, little resources are available for ground-based assessment, and remote
sensing techniques are increasingly explored for usability with minimal ground-truthing. Our accuracy
assessment on each remotely sensed data product put us within the acceptable range of accuracy for
spatial products [45].
Spatial heterogeneity directly aﬀects ecosystem patterns and processes but can be diﬃcult
to measure in a consistent way to inform federal land management priorities. Heterogeneity is
characterized by a focal patch type interacting with the mosaic of surrounding patches or patch
types across an area of interest [46] and can inﬂuence a variety of ecological responses, including
animal movement, species interactions, ﬁre spread and behavior, and overall ecosystem function [47].
For land managers, landscape heterogeneity is important to support multiple seral stages as habitat
for wildlife species, biodiversity, ecosystem function, and can aid in characterizing fuels and wildﬁre
spread [48–51]. We chose a variety of metrics to quantify landscape pattern attributes and assess
sensitivity to management practices found in western, frequent-ﬁre forests.
Patch attributes such as mean patch density (PD) that depend on discriminating smaller patches
are highly underestimated by coarser grained products (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2). The grain of both
Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 is too large to detect individual small patches. Small patches are lumped
together, resulting in fewer, but larger patches. The proportion of landscape of canopy cover (PLand)
can be a highly variable metric, especially at smaller extents (10–25 ha) but is more stable at larger
extents (≥300 ha). On all three landscapes, ﬁne-scale heterogeneity becomes harder to detect by each
data product at scales 300 ha and larger. On our highly managed landscape, Windmill Draw, there is
less ﬁne-scale landscape variability of canopy cover. Landsat-8 (30 m grain) and Sentinel-2 (10 m grain)
over-predicted proportion of canopy cover because each pixel size is larger, so when the pixel moves

Forests 2019, 10, 465
17 of 21
across the landscape at various spatial extents, it often ﬁnds canopy cover in the pixel and classiﬁes it
as cover (See Figure 2). On the other hand, NAIP under-predicted PLand across all landscapes and
spatial extents because the 1 m data product cell resolution was too small to accurately estimate the
true pattern of PLand across the landscapes.
Canopy cover is a diﬃcult metric to use solely to assess forest conditions and forest restoration
and fuels reduction projects [52–54]. However, canopy cover has been incorporated into southwestern
US forest service directives (USDA FS Region 3), including forest planning, as a surrogate for wildlife
habitat. Canopy patterns measured at smaller scales do not necessarily scale up appropriately, and the
processes identiﬁed at small scales are not always the drivers at larger spatial scales. When this happens,
incorrect inferences can be made for the phenomena or species of interest and incorrect management
actions may be chosen. Canopy cover should be selected at the appropriate scale for the analysis
or phenomena of interest, including appropriate grain (cell resolution) and spatial extent. Canopy
cover-informed spatial metrics, combined with additional forest structural information, including
tree size (height and diameter), age, species composition, and tree densities are all important factors
in determining if management actions have restored forest structure to within the natural range
of variability [55–57]. Used together, these variables are more informative for quantifying wildlife
habitat, potential ﬁre behavior, landscape connectivity, and forest restoration success and resilience to
disturbances [51,57–59].
Heterogeneity in frequent-ﬁre ponderosa pine forests has been captured at ﬁne scales [60].
To capture this remotely, LiDAR is a very robust data source that can accurately produce models of
canopy cover and openings due to the inherent quality of the data. NAIP has a very small (≤1 m)
cell resolution and the user has to classify shadows, bare ground, shrubs and more, therefore there
are inherent classiﬁcation errors at the 1 m. Re-scaling NAIP data to a minimum cell resolution of
2.5 m could help reduce some classiﬁcation error and increase the accuracy of a binary canopy/not
canopy classiﬁcation. From a management perspective and in a landscape ecology context, forest
heterogeneity is often characterized on large landscapes (1000′s–10,000′s of hectares in size) where
patterns of large-scale heterogeneity are often detected. Southwestern US forests that evolved with
frequent ﬁre have ﬁne-scale heterogeneity [60], which is often harder to describe in a binary landscape.
As the USDA Forest Service is tasked to meet urgent goals of managing for forest resiliency to future
disturbances, metrics of ﬁne-scale heterogeneity and the methods to summarize these metrics across
large scales will be useful to assess treatment success. Using other information in tandem with canopy
cover, such as tree size and age classes, structural composition, and species composition will be more
informative and helpful in elucidating landscape patterns and processes than using canopy cover
alone. Although analyses should include structural and compositional variables, remotely sensed data
acquisitions may be faster, and better assessed to quickly inform adaptive management.
Limitations of This Study
In this study we calculated landscape metrics on a single class (canopy cover), and therefore can
only make inferences on canopy cover and canopy cover-related landscape metrics. We did not describe
spatial patterns of patches and openings nor make comparisons among classes. Additionally, our three
landscapes varied in size, and therefore landscape metrics were calculated on diﬀerent maximum
extents. Diﬀerences in data product and grain (cell resolution) caused diﬀerences in how landscape
patterns of canopy cover were calculated and were more evident than diﬀerences due to spatial extent.
Accuracy of unsupervised classiﬁcation of our data products ranged from 56% to 85%, and while
acceptable by most classiﬁcation standards this is still an important source of uncertainty. The LiDAR
data used in this analysis is the best estimate of canopy cover in our study area, and interpretations of
results should be made accordingly.

5. Conclusions
Spatial products at diﬀerent resolutions performed diﬀerently across patch metrics and across our
three landscapes. Overall, Sentinel-2 data at 10 m and NAIP at 1 m resolution most often successfully
characterized patch metrics in our analysis compared to LiDAR. Landsat-8 varied in its ability to
accurately characterize patch metrics due to its coarse cell resolution of 30 m, while NAIP at 1 m
resolution often underestimated canopy cover patterns. Metrics that describe spatial connectedness
and distribution of patches, such as aggregation index and patch cohesion index, were well described
by all three spatial data products. LiDAR data provide the most accurate and high-resolution data
that can be used to characterize forest structure, tree spatial patterns, and canopy metrics on our three
landscapes in northern Arizona, USA. Analyses may beneﬁt from using more than one spatial data
product at diﬀerent grains and at multiple spatial extents to describe forest heterogeneity and structural
characteristics within a landscape.
