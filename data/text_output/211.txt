Abstract.
The age structure in 1876, the last year of the natural frequent-ﬁre regime,
of an unharvested ponderosa pine forest in northern Arizona was reconstructed from living
and dead dendrochronological samples. Approximately 20% of the trees were .200 yr old
in 1876 with ages ranging to 540 yr. If dead trees had not been included in the reconstruction,
the distribution would have been biased toward younger trees and a 40% shorter age range.
The presettlement age distribution was multimodal with broad peaks of establishment,
consistent with the model of regeneration in ‘‘safe sites’’ where herbaceous competition
and ﬁre thinning are reduced. Although ﬁre disturbance regimes and climatic conditions
varied over the centuries before 1876, a clear relationship between these variations and
tree establishment was not observed. Due to ﬁre exclusion, reduced grass competition, and
favorable climatic events, high levels of regeneration in the 20th century raised forest
density from 60 trees/ha in 1876 to .3000 trees/ha in 1992. An ecological restoration
experiment initiated in 1993 conserved all living presettlement trees and reduced the density
of young trees to near-presettlement levels. Two important components for evaluating the
restoration treatment effects are monitoring of old-tree persistence and patterns of future
regeneration in the context of the presettlement reference age structure.

INTRODUCTION
Southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) for-
ests have undergone substantial changes in structure
and function associated with livestock grazing, log-
ging, and disruption of the natural frequent-ﬁre regime
following Euro-American settlement (Cooper 1960,
Covington and Moore 1994a, Swetnam and Baisan
1996). Quantitative reconstructions of presettlement
conditions, including age structure (the distribution and
range of tree ages), serve as a basic point of reference
central to restoration and management of these eco-
systems (Covington et al. 1997, Fule´ et al. 1997). Old
trees have unique characteristics. They create habitat
for various wildlife species through the persistence of
dead tops and branches, which form ‘‘living snags’’
and provide structural diversity in tree height and
patchy distribution. Old trees perpetuate genetic di-
versity over multicentury life-spans and they hold the
tree-ring record of past climate and disturbance regimes
(Swetnam and Brown 1992). The number of old trees
in southwestern ponderosa pine forests has fallen mark-
edly since settlement because of logging, increasing
competition from dense young trees (Sutherland et al.
1991, Biondi et al. 1994), and increasing crown ﬁres
(Swetnam 1990).
Because they are usually the slowest organismic

variable in ecosystems, conservation of old-growth
trees is a central management concern (Kaufmann et
al. 1992). The dynamics of the presettlement ponderosa
ecosystem,
including
regeneration
(Cooper
1960,
White 1985), responses to changing climate (Grissino-
Mayer 1996; Swetnam and Betancourt, unpublished
manuscript) and disturbance regimes (Covington and
Moore 1994a), may be inferred to some extent from
historic age structure, especially where both living and
dead trees are sampled (Johnson et al. 1994). An un-
derstanding of these processes in the presettlement eco-
system, which reﬂected the selection pressures of the
recent evolutionary environment, forms the basis for
(1) management prescriptions (e.g., even- vs. uneven-
aged management, rotation age [Smith 1986:8]); (2)
determining desired future condition goals based on
reference conditions (Kaufman et al. 1994); and (3)
designing and evaluating ecological restoration treat-
ments (Covington et al. 1997).
Climate is an important inﬂuence underlying epi-
sodic southwestern ponderosa pine seed production,

(Pearson
1923, Schubert 1974, Savage and Swetnam 1990). Sav-
age et al. (1996) used instrument weather records to
examine the effect of climate on ponderosa pine re-
generation at the Gustav A. Pearson Natural Area
(GPNA), an unharvested research forest in northern
Arizona that has been repeatedly measured since 1920
(Avery et al. 1976). They found that the criteria for

regeneration success, mainly warm and wet conditions
several years before and #1 yr after regeneration
events, occurred rarely. In the 20th century, only 1919
(a year of widespread ponderosa regeneration) and
1992 had highly favorable conditions.
Regional climatic events at multiyear scales, such as
severe drought periods in the late 1500s and mid-1900s
(D’Arrigo and Jacoby 1991, Grissino-Mayer 1996) also
appear to have affected tree establishment, mortality,
and ﬁre disturbance regimes in many southwestern co-
niferous ecosystems (Swetnam and Betancourt 1990,
Grissino-Mayer 1996, Swetnam and Betancourt, un-
published manuscript). In particular, evidence from
dendrochronological sampling designed to measure ex-
tremely old ponderosa pines suggests that the late
1500s drought period may have led to a regional die-
off, similar to that observed in pinyon pine (Pinus ed-
ulis) in central New Mexico during the 1950s drought
(Swetnam and Betancourt, unpublished manuscript).
Frequent, low-intensity ﬁre is the key disturbance
process that regulated southwestern ponderosa pine
ecosystems (Cooper 1960, Covington and Moore
1994a, b, Swetnam and Baisan 1996). White (1985)
sampled living old-growth ponderosa pines at the
GPNA in order to deduce regeneration patterns prior
to 1876, the year in which ﬁre exclusion was initiated
(Dieterich 1980). He suggested that successful tree es-
tablishment depended on the creation of a ‘‘safe site’’
such as the ash bed of a consumed log, where seedlings
could establish and grow above the lethal ﬂaming zone.
This model implies that seedling establishment and sur-
vival were low, but that the survival of saplings that
passed through the competition–ﬁre ﬁlter was high,
leading to a relatively ﬂat age distribution rather than
the reverse-J age distribution expected in an uneven-
aged forest with age-constant or age-increasing mor-
tality (Silvertown 1987:101). In contrast, however,
White (1985) found a high proportion of trees (74%)
less than 100 yr old in 1876, producing a relatively
large pulse of tree establishment resembling the re-
verse-J curve, preceded by a relatively continuous pat-
tern of establishment back to 1572.
Ecological restoration treatments have been pro-
posed to reverse the effects of extended ﬁre exclusion,
such as higher tree densities, reduced understory pro-
ductivity and diversity, and the high threat of land-
scape-scale crown ﬁres (Covington and Moore 1994a).
Restoration treatments are designed to emulate the
structure, function, and composition of indigenous eco-
systems, restoring as far as possible the conditions
characteristic of the evolutionary environment of na-
tive plants and animals (Covington et al. 1997). From
1993 to 1994, we initiated an ecological restoration
experiment in a portion of the GPNA where managers
recognized that increasing postsettlement tree density
had come to pose an unacceptable ﬁre hazard to the
historic Fort Valley Experimental Forest headquarters
buildings. The restoration treatments included thinning
of most postsettlement trees, forest ﬂoor fuel reduction,
recreation of grass fuelbeds, and prescribed burning.
The experiments on the 4.7-ha study site comprised
;1.5 ha of full restoration treatment (thinning and
burning), 1.5 ha with thinning but no burning, and 1.5
ha control, plus ;0.2 ha of excluded areas (Covington
et al. 1997).
Determining reference conditions of forest structure
was an initial step in the restoration experiment. Our
ﬁrst goal was to determine the historic presettlement
age distribution of this portion of the Pearson forest in
1876, the last year of the presettlement frequent-ﬁre
regime (Dieterich 1980). We sampled dead as well as
living trees to fully reconstruct age structure and draw
the best-supported inferences possible about forest dy-
namics under past climatic and disturbance regimes.
Our second goal was to contrast the historic reference
age structure (1876) to that of the dense postsettlement
forest (1992). Finally, we compared the reference con-
dition (1876) to that of the restored forest (1994) in
order to assess the initial restoration treatment and sug-
gest criteria for future evaluation of forest age structure
as a component of ecosystem restoration.
METHODS
Study area
The study area is a 4.7-ha virgin (never logged) pon-
derosa pine forest within the GPNA at the Fort Valley
Experimental Forest, ;15 km NW of Flagstaff, Ari-
zona. Trees .15.2 cm at breast height within the Nat-
ural Area have been measured at ﬁve- or ten-year in-
tervals since 1920 (Avery et al. 1976 and unpublished
data). The study area has gentle topography and a cool,
subhumid climate. Mean annual precipitation is 57 cm,
with approximately half occurring as snow. The re-
mainder occurs as summer monsoonal rains following
the spring/early summer drought. Soils are of volcanic
origin, a ﬁne montmorillonitic complex of frigid Typic
Argiboroll and Mollic Eutroboralf (Covington et al.
1997). The ponderosa pine structure consists of groups
of mature trees, characterized by larger size and yel-
lowed bark, above dense thickets of smaller, dark-
barked trees. Understory vegetation includes perennial
grasses, primarily Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica),
mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia montana), and squir-
reltail (Sitanion hystrix), and forbs.
Field methods
The species, diameter at breast height (dbh), preset-
tlement/postsettlement status, and condition were re-
corded for all living and dead trees in 1992. Field de-
termination of presettlement or postsettlement status
was based on size and appearance. All ponderosa pines
.37.5 cm dbh and smaller pines with yellowed, platy
bark were considered potentially presettlement, based
on dendrochronological results from an adjacent area
(White 1985). Condition classes were developed from

snag and log decomposition models applied in pon-
derosa pine forests in the Paciﬁc Northwest (Maser et
al. 1979, Thomas et al. 1979), the Rocky Mountains
(Lundquist 1995), and Arizona (Covington and Moore
1994a, Fule´ et al. 1997). The nine condition classes
were deﬁned as: 1, living; 2, declining; 3, recent snag;
4, loose bark snag; 5, clean snag; 6, snag broken above
1.37 m; 7, snag broken below 1.37 m; 8, downed log;
and 9, cut stump. These classes were used to charac-
terize dead tree structure and to estimate the death dates
and sizes of presettlement-era trees.
Samples (cores, wedges, and disks) from all dead-
standing and downed ponderosa pines were obtained
with increment borers and chainsaws in 1993 to provide
ages and dates of death for the presettlement dead trees.
Most samples were taken at ;45 cm above ground level
(stump height). When the pattern of bark persistence
permitted, samples were taken from areas with bark
and without bark to allow examination of ring loss due
to weathering. Samples included some trees with rotten
centers for which only a minimum age could be de-
termined.
All the presettlement trees and a random subsample
of postsettlement trees were cored at 45 cm above
ground level (stump height) in 1992. Because several
cores from presettlement trees were damaged or distant
from the pith, increment cores were collected again
from all living presettlement trees in 1995. Increment
core collections were done to meet two research goals:
(1) determining tree age; and (2) reconstructing the size
of trees in 1876, the time ﬁre exclusion began (Cov-
ington et al. 1997). The stump height coring is a com-
promise between the goal of determining total tree age,
which is most accurate when cores are taken as close
as possible to the ground (Telewski 1993, Savage et al.
1996), and the goal of determining past tree size by
calculating the radial growth increment from 1876 to
present. Diameter at stump height (dsh) is very highly
correlated with dbh, in contrast to the butt swell and
irregular stem form that would reduce the accuracy of
size reconstruction if trees were cored at ground level.
Trees were cored repeatedly wherever increment cores
were distant from the pith or where rot was encoun-
tered.
Laboratory methods
Samples were mounted and sanded with progres-
sively ﬁner grit sandpaper. Samples from living and
dead trees were crossdated with the aid of skeleton
plots following the techniques of Stokes and Smiley
(1968). Ring widths of all presettlement samples were
measured to the nearest 0.01 mm with a computer-
compatible incremental measuring machine and dating
was checked with the COFECHA program (Grissino-
Mayer and Holmes 1993) against the master chronol-
ogy developed in this study and the chronology de-
veloped locally by Graybill (1987). Several samples
from dead presettlement trees could not be crossdated
initially so ring widths from these samples were mea-
sured and entered into COFECHA as ﬂoating series.
After the software identiﬁed periods of high correla-
tions with the master chronology, the dating was con-
ﬁrmed visually on the samples.
Center dates were determined as the pith dates at
sample height of 45 cm above ground level. Three to
ten years may be required for ponderosa pine seedlings
to reach this height in the Flagstaff area (Sackett 1984,
Cormier 1990). Some presettlement trees had to be
sampled higher to avoid areas of rot or damage. A
sample height of 1.37 m (breast height) was used for
38 living trees and heights between 0.7 and 2 m were
sampled for seven dead trees. Where the sample failed
to intercept the pith, or where the pith was rotten, the
number of years from the innermost ring to the pith
was estimated with a pith locator (concentric circles
matched to the approximate curvature and density of
the remaining inner rings). Only cores that reached the
pith were used in the subsample of postsettlement trees
(N 5 115 cores). Death dates of presettlement trees
that were dead in 1992 were identiﬁed by the ﬁnal year
of growth below the bark or the location where the
inner bark was evidenced by bark beetle galleries.
A number of dead presettlement trees (59 trees, 21%
of the presettlement trees) could not be conﬁrmed as
living or dead in 1876 because the year of death could
not be determined. Either the outermost ring dated as
,1876 or the sample could not be crossdated. For these
trees, a modeling approach based on tree diameter and
condition class was used to reconstruct past forest
structure. Rates of snag decomposition and snagfall
were taken from a locally calibrated model (Rogers et
al. 1984). Because these decomposition rates are im-
precise, a sensitivity analysis was carried out by com-
paring three different snag decomposition rate percen-
tiles (25, 50, and 75%) to examine the effect of slower
and faster decomposition. The method is described in
detail by Fule´ et al. (1997).
RESULTS
Two hundred and three trees were successfully dated
to center. The reconstructed 1876 age distribution (Fig.
1) shows several broad peaks of tree establishment,
especially in the late 1500s, around 1700, and in the
mid-1800s. The oldest tree, center date 1333, was .540
yr old in 1876. Only three trees have center dates before
the 1550s. Even after 1600, however, several decades
have few or no establishing trees and appear as dips
in the age distribution. The most pronounced dips occur
around 1615 and the mid-1700s. The youngest trees,
with center dates (at 45 cm) of 1871, 1872, and 1877,
were seedlings in 1876. Regeneration was fairly com-
mon in the presettlement GPNA forest (Fig. 1), with
tree establishment per decade ﬂuctuating over approx-
imately an eight-fold range from 2 to 17 trees on the
4.7-ha study site (0.4–3.6 trees·ha21·decade21) from the
1550s to 1870s. The maximum period without evidence

The tree-ring width index and climate features re-
constructed from dendrochronological data are plotted
in Fig. 1 above the age distribution. Nonoverlapping

nearest Flagstaff (Gridpoint 41 [Cook et al. 1996]) are
compared with the longer ring-width index at the
GPNA (Graybill 1987: AZ521.CRN). Trends in both
indices are similar over the overlapping time period
(;1700 to present).
Past research has emphasized the episodic nature of
ponderosa regeneration, depending on annual to bi-
ennial climatic events (e.g., Schubert 1974, Savage et
al. 1996). However, the multimodal peaks of presettle-
ment tree establishment in Fig. 1 are relatively wide,
ranging from 30 to 60 yr. We tested the possibility that
wide establishment peaks were an artifact of impre-
cision in the center date estimation method by selecting
the subset of samples, comprising 57% (117/203 trees)
of the total number of dated trees, which either inter-
sected the pith or were within an estimated 5 yr of
center. This highly reliable subset had peaks of estab-
lishment as broad as the full data set (Fig. 2). In con-
trast, the postsettlement tree establishment pattern was
relatively narrow with 77% of the center dates occur-
ring in the decade 1920–1929 and 92% in the two
decades 1920–1939 (Fig. 3). Given the high probability
that almost all of these trees actually germinated in
1919 (Savage et al. 1996), these results suggest that
the imprecision in estimation of germination date due
to sampling at stump height is contained within 20 yr.
The broader peaks of presettlement tree establishment,
in sum, appear to represent a true range of establish-
ment dates, rather than being artifacts of the sampling
or analysis methods. However, some of the highest pre-
settlement establishment peaks, such as 1680–1699 or
1820–1839 may represent individual exceptionally
good regeneration years.
The accuracy of ﬁeld determination of presettlement
status was high due to the combination of conservative
identiﬁcation of potentially presettlement living trees,
ensuring that borderline trees are cored for age mea-
surement, together with the high accuracy of identiﬁ-
cation of dead presettlement trees. Seventeen living
trees, identiﬁed as potentially presettlement based on
having dbh .37.5 cm but also having dark bark, were
conﬁrmed from their increment cores to be postsettle-
ment trees. All dead material identiﬁed as presettlement
in the ﬁeld was conﬁrmed to be of presettlement origin.
Dead material of postsettlement origin was easily dis-
tinguished from presettlement dead material in the ﬁeld
by smaller size, darker bark, form (e.g., small, thin
branches), and decay. Accurate ﬁeld determination of

living and dead presettlement trees is important not
only for reconstruction research but also for ecological
restoration treatments designed to emulate historic for-
est structure.
Center dates were determined for 71% (203/284) of
the trees of presettlement origin. Inner ring dates rang-
ing from 1492 to 1850 were determined for an addi-
tional 14% (41/284) of the presettlement trees (Fig. 4).
Because the inner ring dates vary over a broad range,
the inability to determine center dates of these 41 trees
does not appear to bias the age structure in Fig. 1, as
would be the case if dates of a substantial cohort of
trees of similar age were missing together. However,
trees could be far older than the inner ring dates.
Determination of death dates was one of the objec-
tives of dendrochronological analysis but decay of sap-

wood rings prevented direct measurement of most
death dates. In general, the majority of the sapwood
was still present on these samples, but the rings closest
to the cambium—critical for accurate death dating—
appeared to be the most likely to decay. Death dates
were determined on only 6 of the 86 dated dead trees
(7%): ﬁve stumps (death years 1880, 1934, 1938, 1973,
and 1975) and one downed log (1944). Stumps exist
in the unharvested GPNA because of snag-felling to
minimize ﬁre hazard (a discontinued practice). No
death dates before 1876 were found and many dead
trees were alive in 1876 or later, as evidenced by post-
1876 rings. However, the samples from 59 now-dead
trees lacked direct evidence of post-1876 growth, i.e.,
post-1876 rings. All such trees were estimated to be
alive in 1876 by applying the snag decomposition mod-
els with the fast (75%) and average (50%) decompo-
sition rates (Fule´ et al. 1997). Using the slow (25%)
rate, two large trees were estimated to have pre-1876
death dates (both 1803) and three additional trees had
estimated death dates shortly thereafter (1878 [two
trees] and 1883).
Age structure of the forest was dominated by young
trees in 1992 (Fig. 3). Dense thickets of trees, most
originating in the highly favorable establishment year
of 1919 (Savage et al. 1996), raised forest density from
60 trees/ha in 1876 to 3097 trees/ha in 1992. Residual
age structure in 1994, following the restoration treat-
ments on 3.2 ha, is shown in Fig. 5. The restoration
thinning reduced forest density on the 3.2 ha treated
area to 152 trees/ha. A margin of trees above the pre-
settlement density was retained in part because the re-
placement trees for now-dead presettlement trees often
had thin stems and sparse foliage due to the high den-
sity of the thickets in which they grew (Covington et
al. 1997). The post-treatment forest is still numerically
dominated by younger trees, primarily from the 1919
cohort, but the proportion of young trees relative to
presettlement trees is reduced (Fig. 5). The relative age
structures of the 1876, 1992, and post-treatment 1994
forests are compared in Fig. 6. In 1876, trees .200 yr
old comprised ;20% of the forest, and trees .100 yr
old made up 60%, leaving 40% of the age distribution
in trees ,100 yr old. By 1992, .99% of the age dis-
tribution was composed of the dense young trees below
;70 yr old. In the post-treatment (1994) forest, this
younger cohort of trees still makes up ;80% of tree
density.
DISCUSSION
Importance of including now-dead trees
Although the GPNA is an unlogged preserve, pre-
settlement age structure would appear quite different
if only living trees were sampled. Living trees, indi-
cated with solid bars in Fig. 1, make up 71% (142/203
trees) of the center date samples, but the living-tree
proportion of the presettlement age distribution de-
clines toward the older age classes. The most recent
peak of tree establishment, from 1760 to 1880, is rep-
resented in the sample by 82 living and 5 dead trees.
The sample representing the previous broad establish-
ment period, 1600 to 1759, includes 55 living and 35
dead trees. The earliest period, up to 1599, has only 5

living and 21 dead trees in the sample. The oldest trees
in 1876, three trees ranging from 482 to 543 yr old (at
sampling height), are all dead today. If only living trees
had been sampled, the apparently oldest tree in 1876
would have been only 322 yr old (center date 1554),
shortening the age range by 221 yr (.40%).
The truncated presettlement age distribution created
by excluding the now-dead component of age structure
may be seen in the results of White (1985), who aged
236 living presettlement-era pines in the GPNA adja-
cent to our study site. The oldest trees he found were
;300 yr old in 1876 (but his largest-diameter trees
were not aged and several sampled trees had rotten
centers).
Even in unharvested forests increasing mortality of
trees in the oldest age classes is a concern. Mortality
of presettlement trees has risen substantially over the
20th century from 0.5 trees·ha21·decade21 in the 1920s
to as many as 5.9 trees·ha21·decade21 in the 1970s at
the 16-ha GPNA (Fig. 7). Increased competition from
dense postsettlement trees leading to reduced vigor and
defensive capabilities of the old trees, together with

Mortality of large ponderosa pine

course of the 20th century. Data were collected

unpublished data).
stagnated nutrient cycling in the absence of ﬁre, have
been suggested as key causes for increased mortality
(Sutherland et al. 1991, Biondi et al. 1994). In addition,
the increased occurrence of crown ﬁres due to high fuel
loading and fuel continuity across the Southwest (Swet-
nam 1990) is killing old trees at a regional scale.
In harvested forests the absence of now-dead pre-
settlement trees can obviously truncate the age struc-
ture. Fule´ et al. (1997) sampled a 700-ha ponderosa
pine forest that had been harvested beginning in the
1880s, located ;15 km SW of the GPNA. Based only
on living tree samples, they found that the oldest tree
in 1883, the date of ﬁre regime disruption, was only
186 yr old (center date 1697), and the second-oldest
tree was only 122 yr old. In contrast, numerous samples
collected for ﬁre history analysis at the same site from
stumps (harvested between 1880 and 1933) and logs
had center dates or inner rings before 1600; the three
oldest samples established before 1450 (Fule´ et al.
1997).
The high costs of dendrochronological sampling and
analysis are likely to preclude extensive reconstruc-
tions of past age structure in most management situ-
ations. But managers should be aware that reference
age structures based on data from living trees are prob-
ably biased toward younger trees even in unharvested
forests. Where the oldest trees appear to have been
missed, an approximate range of potential maximal
ages could be developed based on data such as shown
in Fig. 1 or in Swetnam and Brown (1992), who present
maximal age information on a number of southwestern
conifer species.
Forest dynamics, climate, and disturbance
By including dead trees in the age reconstruction,
our results appear consistent with the seedling mortal-
ity–sapling survival model described by White (1985).
Trees #100 yr old in 1876 made up only 42% (85/203
trees) of the overstory in our study (Fig. 1), producing
a relatively ﬂat age distribution in contrast to the large
peak (74%) of trees ,100 yr old found by White
(1985). If dead trees had not been included in our study,
the proportion of trees would be closer to White’s re-
sults: the component ,100 yr old would make up 58%
of the sample (82/142 trees).
The use of static age structures to infer forest dy-
namics has been criticized by Johnson et al. (1994).
By sampling living and dead trees to reconstruct a se-
ries of past stand conditions, they showed that the ab-
sence of trees in past age classes does not necessarily
mean that no trees established in that period; the trees
may have established and then died without ever grow-
ing into the canopy. Although this is a valuable caveat,
southwestern ponderosa pine has a distinctly different
forest structure, which can affect the interpretation of
forest dynamics. The northern coniferous forests of
lodgepole pine–Engelmann spruce (Pinus contorta–
Picea engelmannii) studied by Johnson et al. (1994)
were closed-canopy, dense stands (for dbh .3 cm,
1400–16 200 stems/ha), originating from high-inten-
sity, stand-replacing ﬁres. In contrast, presettlement
southwestern ponderosa pine forests were open (7–116
stems/ha [Covington and Moore 1994b]) with a high
proportion, up to 80%, of grassy openings (Covington
and Sackett 1984, Covington et al. 1997). In such open
conditions, ponderosa trees that survived the compe-
tition–ﬁre ﬁlter would have been unlikely to die as
suppressed subcanopy saplings, implying that the mul-
timodal age distribution (Fig. 1) reﬂects actual long-
term establishment patterns rather than the ‘‘missing
cohorts’’ of regeneration detected by Johnson et al.
(1994).
Climatic patterns do not appear to be easily related
to presettlement tree establishment (Fig. 1; see also
White 1985). The greatest ﬂuctuation in the PDSI re-
construction was a drought period near 1890 followed
by positive PDSI values in the early 20th century. The
late-1500s drought (;1570 to 1600), described by
Grissino-Mayer (1996) as the most severe short-term
(,50 yr) southwestern drought in the past 2000 yr, is
not covered by the PDSI reconstruction (Cook et al.
1996), but the GPNA tree-ring index shows a decline
in the late 1500s. However, apart from the highly fa-
vorable moisture conditions in the early 20th century—
the excellent period for seedling establishment de-

scribed by Savage et al. (1996)—other climate patterns
do not appear to coincide consistently with the mul-
timodal pattern of tree establishment. For example, the
decline in pine establishment around 1870 (the end of
the ﬁnal presettlement regeneration pulse) does match
a decline in PDSI values, but the mid-1700s regener-
ation gap occurred during a minor PDSI peak (Fig. 1).
Relatively common regeneration, as well as the same
mid-1700s absence of establishment, was also noted
by White (1985) at the GPNA. Savage (1991) found
similar steady presettlement regeneration patterns in
the Chuska Mountains of Arizona and New Mexico
(;180 km east of the study area), although the meth-
odology of sampling above ground level did not give
precise regeneration dates. These continuing patterns
suggest that although presettlement trees did not es-
tablish densely, their establishment was not limited
only to sporadic favorable years separated by long in-
tervals, such as the 73-yr gap between the good con-
ditions in 1919 and 1992 (Savage et al. 1996).
Combining the climate and disturbance histories may
lead to a more complete picture of presettlement re-
generation dynamics. Comparisons between the ﬁre
history developed by Dieterich (1980) and the GPNA
age structure (Fig. 1) are limited by the small number
of ﬁre-scarred samples (N 5 7 trees; N 5 1 tree from
1540 to 1754). The small sample size means that ﬁre
intervals before the mid-1700s are probably overesti-
mated, since the single sample tree is unlikely to have
recorded every ﬁre. In addition, the application of pro-
portional ﬁlters to estimate ﬁre size and/or intensity,
based on ﬁres scarring at least a single sample and then
progressively 10%, 25%, etc. of the samples (Swetnam
and Baisan 1996), is precluded with so few samples.
Dieterich (1980) did identify distinct periods of dif-
ferent ﬁre return intervals since 1754. The overall com-
posite ﬁre interval (CFI) at Chimney Spring from 1754
to 1876, the year of the last ﬁre, was 2.4 yr but the
period from 1824 to 1869 recorded the highest fre-
quency of ﬁre recurrence (CFI 5 1.7 yr) in the South-
west, covering most of the last presettlement regen-
eration peak at GPNA (Fig. 1). White (1985) suggested
that these frequent ﬁres could have prevented fuel ac-
cumulations that would support intense burning, per-
haps allowing more seedlings to survive, in contrast to
the less frequent, and possibly more intense, ﬁres in
the preceding 1754–1800 period (CFI 5 3.8 yr). The
mid-1800s (;1820–1860) were also a relatively wet
period in the PDSI reconstruction (Cook et al. 1996).
Favorable weather conditions, leading to good produc-
tion of herbaceous and leaf litter fuels, could have sup-
ported more frequent ﬁres. This interpretation is con-
sistent with the high Southwest-scale presettlement ﬁre
occurrence following moist El Nin˜o years, which fa-
cilitated ﬁne-fuel production (Swetnam and Betancourt
1990, Swetnam and Baisan 1996). However, a rela-
tively wet PDSI period also coincided with most of the
longer interval ﬁre period in the late 1700s (Fig. 1).
Additional ﬁre history information with greater spatial
and temporal depth would be needed to more fully
explore the climate–ﬁre disturbance–pine establish-
ment relationship.
The clearest connection between climate, ﬁre his-
tory, and forest structure is the tremendous regenera-
tion pulse occurring under excellent climatic conditions
in the early 20th century. As noted by Savage et al.
(1996), although the climatic events themselves were
probably not unprecedented, the establishment pulse
may have been unique in the evolutionary history of
ponderosa pine because of the extent of anthropogenic
elimination of vegetative competition and the ﬁre dis-
turbance regime. The domination of resources by these
dense young tree groups again changed the site. Even
though a relatively large number of seedlings estab-
lished in 1992 at our study area, the great majority
have since died under the dense postsettlement canopy
(P. Z. Fule´, personal observation). Without the changes
caused by Euro-American settlement, the early 20th
century could still have had a favorable regeneration
pulse, with some seedlings surviving frequent but cool-
er ﬁres supported by good ﬁne-fuel production under
moist conditions. However, the density of tree estab-
lishment would have remained orders of magnitude
less.
Ecological restoration of forest age structure
The motivation for ecological restoration is generally
based on the perception that an ecosystem has become
degraded relative to its previous or reference state
(Aronson et al. 1993, Jackson et al. 1995). The extent
of reference knowledge required to make good resto-
ration decisions is a matter of considerable debate,
however, ranging from highly detailed reconstructions
of historic ecosystem structure and process (e.g., Bon-
nicksen and Stone 1985, Aronson et al. 1995) to a broad
understanding of past disturbance regimes and species
composition (e.g., Hobbs and Norton 1996, Parsons and
Van Wagtendonk 1996).
Reference conditions can be determined with great
precision for many attributes of southwestern ponder-
osa pine ecosystems. The precise dendrochronological
record, preserved in an arid climate and protected from
ﬁre for a century or more, permits reconstruction of
past climate (e.g., a .2000-yr climate record in pon-
derosa pine forests [Grissino-Mayer 1996]), ﬁre and
other disturbance regimes (e.g., insect defoliation [Mil-
ler and Wagner 1989]), and tree structure for an ex-
tended period into the past. The natural range of vari-
ability (Morgan et al. 1994, Swanson et al. 1994) in
reference conditions provides a perspective from which
to evaluate contemporary conditions. For example, al-
though presettlement GPNA tree establishment varied
over an 83 range in the three centuries before ﬁre
exclusion, this variability is dwarfed by the increase
of approximately two orders of magnitude in the early
20th century.

RESTORATION OF PONDEROSA AGE STRUCTURE
Restoration goals should be explicit and quantiﬁable
(Aronson et al. 1995, Hobbs and Norton 1996) with
objectives that can be attained within a reasonable time
period (e.g., Jackson et al. 1995 suggested ;50 yr).
How can these criteria be addressed in the context of
age structure, when centuries may be required to regain
the oldest trees?
In an integrated ecosystem restoration, we suggest
that ﬁrst, all living presettlement trees should be re-
tained, conserving the slowest organismic variables.
Second, the younger tree component will be maintained
by selecting postsettlement trees to replace dead pre-
settlement trees. An excess of these young trees should
be retained, to account for potential increased mortality
resulting from the restoration treatments themselves.
Approximately three replacements were left for each
dead presettlement tree in the present study (Covington
et al. 1997). If too many trees are retained, however,
the forest will remain far from reference conditions of
tree density, spatial pattern, herbaceous production,
crown ﬁre hazard, etc. The cost and impacts of future
removal of excess trees should also be considered.
Third, monitoring of age structure over time will
serve as an ongoing standard of evaluation. Persistence
of the oldest trees over successively longer periods is
one indicator of restoration success; high mortality of
these trees would indicate problems. For example,
Sackett et al. (1996) found that mortality of presettle-
ment trees in prescribed burned plots (39% over 20 yr)
near the GPNA was over twice that of unburned plots
(16% over 20 yr), leading to a re-evaluation of the
treatment. Comparing mortality following treatments
to that of ‘‘untreated’’—but nonetheless dense—adja-
cent stands can also present problems, because older
trees in these stands are suffering a disproportionate
growth reduction due to intense competition with youn-
ger trees (Sutherland et al. 1991, Biondi 1996). The
reference age structure can help provide a benchmark.
In the simplest demographic formulation, without mak-
ing mortality or natality assumptions (Silvertown
1987), maintenance of 60 trees/23 ha (620%) in a dis-
tribution with a maximum age of 540 yr (620%) pre-
dicts a mortality rate range of 0.6–1.4 trees·ha21·decade,21
about 1–3% per decade. These ﬁgures are reasonably
consistent with the 3.3% mortality per decade measured
by Pearson (1950) on trees .30.5 cm dbh (many of
which were probably presettlement trees) in a virgin
ponderosa pine stand from 1925–1940, a period when
competitive stress from postsettlement trees was prob-
ably still relatively low (Biondi 1996). The estimates
are also consistent with the presettlement tree estab-
lishment rate of 0.4–3.6 trees·ha21·decade21 at our
study area.
Finally, the effect on tree establishment and mortal-
ity of ecological processes such as repeated ﬁre dis-
turbance in the restored system can be evaluated against
the reference age distribution and other reference eco-
system structural parameters. These comparisons will
contribute to an adaptive understanding of both past
and present ecosystem dynamics, because our obser-
vations in a restored ecosystem will give insights into
past mechanisms such as the safe site regeneration
model. At the same time, our reference knowledge will
help us evaluate whether restoration to within the range
of natural variability succeeds.
Ecological restoration is neither a certain nor a static
science. Novel and unpredicted anthropogenic impacts,
such as the massive tree establishment early in the 20th
century, may recur as CO2 levels rise and exotic species
are introduced. Management may have to substitute for
missing parts of the indigenous ecosystem such as pre-
dation and supplemental ﬁre ignitions. While the ability
of restored native ecoystems to regain their self-reg-
ulating, sustainable character under these conditions is
not clear, the risks of mortality on the scale of 106 ha,
loss of biological diversity, and local extinctions
through inaction are increasingly evident. Adaptive
management experiments at scales relevant to ponder-
osa pine landscapes are needed to restore and conserve
these threatened ecosystems.
