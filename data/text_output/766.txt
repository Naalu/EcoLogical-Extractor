Abstract
A restoration project is considered a success when the
initial target is met, but many targets are plausible. We
evaluated the success of a restoration project in its 11th
year since treatment in a southwestern ponderosa pine–
bunchgrass community and the appropriateness of several
targets. We measured the responses of (1) total standing
crop; (2) standing crop of ﬁve functional groups (C3 and
C4 graminoids, leguminous forbs, and nonleguminous
perennial and annual forbs); (3) graminoid community
composition; and (4) standing crop of ﬁve common grami-
noid species (Festuca arizonica, Muhlenbergia montana,
Elymus elymoides, Carex geophila, and Poa fendleriana).
Targets were quantiﬁed in remnant grass patches, which
provided the standards for these targets, and were as-
sessed in three other forest patch types (pre-settlement
tree patches, post-settlement tree patches, and patches
where all post-settlement trees were removed). Patches
where all post-settlement trees were removed reached
target levels for total standing crop, C3 and C4 graminoid
standing crop, graminoid community composition, and
M. montana, E. elymoides, and C. geophila standing
crops. Standing crop of legumes and of F. arizonica did
not increase over time in any patch type. Targets were not
met in pre-settlement patches or in patches where some
post-settlement trees were left standing, suggesting that it
is unrealistic to expect equal responses across all patch
types. If increasing herbaceous standing crop is a major
goal, practitioners should create gaps within the pine for-
est canopy.

Introduction
The success of a restoration project can be quantiﬁed
when targets are set prior to project initiation (Hobbs &
Norton 1996; Bakker et al. 2000). Targets should be
grounded in knowledge attained through previous re-
search and ecological theory (Palmer et al. 1997), should
be an accurate representation of the reference community
(Aronson et al. 1995; White & Walker 1997), and must be
realistic in order to be useful (Ehrenfeld 2000). Choosing
the appropriate target can be difﬁcult when little is known
about long-term treatment effects. Therefore, deﬁning
appropriate targets can be an iterative process because
knowledge of a system is attained through long-term mon-
itoring or adaptive management (Holling 1978) and because
speciﬁc restoration targets become accepted throughout
the restoration community (e.g., Palmer et al. 2005).
Vegetation dynamics among forest patches within a res-
toration context is an underdeveloped area of community
theory, and research in this area can beneﬁt the natural
sciences and restoration practices (Palmer et al. 1997).
Research on patch dynamics in both forest and grassland
communities has elucidated mechanisms of regeneration
through gap creation and turnover (White 1979; Pickett &
White 1985; Aguilera & Lauenroth 1995; Busing & White
1997). Ponderosa pine forests have a distinct structure
where clumps of pine trees are interspersed throughout
a matrix of grassland vegetation. Therefore, vegetation in
the ponderosa pine–bunchgrass ecosystem may exhibit
aspects of both forest and grassland community dynamics.
However, the rate of forest canopy turnover in semiarid
pine forests (White 1985; Mast et al. 1999) is slower than
in mesic temperate forests (Pickett & White 1985). Tree
canopy closure in southwestern ponderosa pine old-
growth stands ranges from 17 to 30% (Pearson 1923;
White 1985), suggesting that open grass patches may have
comprised greater than 70% of the pre-settlement land-
scape [but see Fule´ et al. (2002) for a description of pre-
settlement forests on the Kaibab Plateau]. We deﬁne
‘‘pre-settlement’’ as the era prior to 1876, which corre-
sponds to Euro-American settlement of northern Arizona
and the beginning of widespread ﬁre exclusion (Mast et al.
1999). In contemporary ponderosa pine–bunchgrass com-
munities, three main patch types occur: (1) pre-settlement
(stands of trees that established before 1876); (2) post-set-
tlement (stands of trees that established after 1876); and
(3) remnant grass patches. In this study, we examined

herbaceous standing crop within these patch types and
within a fourth patch type, post-settlement removed, in
which many of the post-settlement trees were thinned.
These forest patch types were stable over the study period,
though the interannual precipitation totals were highly
variable (Fig. 1). Therefore, this study characterizes plant
community structure within the dominant forest patch
types over a range of interannual climatic conditions.
The primary goal of restoring southwestern ponderosa
pine forests is to restore ecosystem health by altering
forest structure to more closely resemble the range of
variability evident in pre-settlement forests and by rein-
troducing ecosystem processes such as frequent, low-
intensity surface ﬁres (Covington et al. 1997; Moore et al.
1999). Inherent within the overall goal of this project were
speciﬁc targets such as (1) restoring pre-settlement forest
densities; size, age, and spatial distributions of trees (Fule´
et al. 1997; Mast et al. 1999; Moore et al. 1999, 2004); and
(2) increasing total understory herbaceous standing crop
to pre-settlement levels. Assessing the success of meeting
the ﬁrst target (forest structure) utilizes hard evidence
because thinning prescriptions are crafted according to
site-speciﬁc extant structural evidence of pre-settlement
forest conditions (Fule´ et al 1997; Mast et al. 1999). Forest
structure can be assessed immediately after treatment.
Prescriptions designed to emulate pre-settlement forest
structure have been successful (Covington et al. 1997),
though their utility depends on the presence of extant
structural evidence (Moore et al. 2004), the availability of
old-growth trees on the restoration site, and post-treatment
mortality due to windthrow and scorch. Assessing the suc-
cess of meeting the second target (herbaceous standing
crop) requires a different approach, however, because
direct evidence of pre-settlement herbaceous standing
crop no longer exists. We used the range of herbaceous
standing crop found within remnant grass patches on the
restoration site as targets.
Remnant grass patches are a useful target because these
areas yield ‘‘contemporary information from the site to be
restored (same place, same time)’’ (White & Walker
1997:344). The reference sites are within the restoration
site, and continued monitoring of these allows us to under-
stand the range of temporal variability within the target.
This strategy assumes that contemporary grass patches are
representative of pre-settlement grass patches, but we felt
this was reasonable because these patches have remained
highly productive and diverse with virtually no non-native
species present. This strategy also assumes that these rem-
nant grass patches are not unique in some other way. In
particular, why have they remained when all other areas
are now occupied by trees? Kerns et al. (2003) found no
difference
in
chemical
and
physical
soil
properties
between remnant grass and post-settlement patches, sug-
gesting that the post-settlement patches represent recent
tree invasion of formerly grassy areas. Therefore, it is
likely that the remnant grass patches have simply not been
invaded by trees yet.
Changes in the understory cannot be determined imme-
diately after treatment; monitoring over many years is
required to determine vegetation responses. During 13
years of monitoring the herbaceous community at Gus
Pearson Natural Area (GPNA), herbaceous standing crop
increased signiﬁcantly in treated areas relative to the con-
trol (Moore et al. 2006). Standing crop was calculated by
weighting the standing crop of each patch type by the
areal extent of the patch type and therefore did not exam-
ine standing crop dynamics within patch types.
In many projects and across many ecosystem types,
practitioners have targeted total biomass (Bakker et al.
2000), abundances of functional groups (Palmer et al. 1997),
and abundances of individual target species (Lambeck
1997; Goldstein 1999); the target depended on the ques-
tions asked. Therefore, we asked several questions about
appropriate targets within this community: (1) Were we
successful at meeting the original target of increasing total
herbaceous standing crop to levels found within the rem-
nant grass patches, and was the initial target realistic for
all patch types? (2) Could functional group standing crop
in remnant grass patches serve as a target? (3) Could gra-
minoid composition in remnant grass patches serve as
a target? (4) Could standing crop of individual graminoid
species within remnant grass patches serve as targets? We
address these questions by analyzing standing crop data
that span 13 years (1992–2004) from a restoration site in
northern Arizona.
Methods
Study Site
This study was conducted at the GPNA, located 10 km
northwest of Flagstaff, Arizona, in the Fort Valley Experi-
mental Forest, Coconino National Forest. The 4.3-ha
study site ranges from 2,195 to –2,255 m in elevation and
has a ﬂat to gently rolling topography. Soils were derived
from Tertiary basalt ﬂows and cinders and are classiﬁed as
a Brolliar stony clay loam and a complex of ﬁne, smectitic
Typic Argiborolls and Mollic Eutroboralfs (Kerns et al.
2003).
The average annual temperature is 7.5C. Average
annual precipitation is approximately 57 cm and follows
a bimodal precipitation pattern, with approximately half
of the precipitation occurring as rain in July and August
and half as snow in the winter. Drought was common dur-
ing this study, with 2002 being especially severe (Fig. 1).
Weather data were taken from the Fort Valley Experi-
mental Station weather records (USDA, Forest Service
Rocky Mountain Research Station, Flagstaff, AZ) and
from the Flagstaff Airport (NOAA 2005) when occasional
data were missing from Fort Valley.
The study area was fenced to exclude domestic ungu-
lates in 1950 (Olberding 2000). In 1992, a 2.4-m-tall fence
was constructed to exclude wild and domestic ungulates
from GPNA. GPNA was never harvested for timber

(Avery et al. 1976), and the last major ﬁre in the area
before this experiment occurred in 1876 (Dieterich 1980).
Ponderosa pine is the only overstory species on the
study site. The understory is dominated by graminoid spe-
cies, including Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica Vasey),
Bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides (Raf.) Swezey
ssp. elymoides), Mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia montana
(Nutt.) A. S. Hitchc.), Muttongrass (Poa fendleriana
(Steud.) Vasey), and White Mountain sedge (Carex geo-
phila Mackenzie). Dominant native forb species include
American vetch (Vicia americana Muhl. Ex. Willd.), Flag-
staff ragwort (Senecio actinella Greene), Pygmy bluet
(Houstonia wrightii Gray), Rusby’s milkvetch (Astragalus
rusbyi Greene), Silvery lupine (Lupinus argenteus Pursh),
Small-leaf pussytoes (Antennaria parvifolia Nutt.), Three-
nerve goldenrod (Solidago velutina DC.), Western yarrow
(Achillea millefolium L. var. occidentalis DC.), and
Wheeler’s thistle (Cirsium wheeleri (Gray) Petrak). The
only shrub on the study site is Fendler’s ceanothus (Cea-
nothus fendleri Gray).
Data Collection
In 1992, 10 circular plots with a diameter of 5 m were
established
within
each
of
four
patch
types
(pre-
settlement,
post-settlement
retained,
post-settlement
removed, and remnant grass patches; Fig. 2) at GPNA, for
a total of 40 plots. One plot per patch type was nested
within a whole plot. Five whole plots were thinned, and
ﬁve received a composite treatment (thinning, reduction
of forest ﬂoor fuels, and prescribed burning) (see Coving-
ton et al. [1997] and Moore et al. [2006] for details of
the experimental design). Pre-settlement patches (Fig. 2)
consisted of clumps of two or more large trees (mostly
>30 cm) that established prior to 1876. Post-settlement
retained patches (Fig. 2) consisted of a stand of small-
diameter (<30 cm) trees that established after 1876. Post-
settlement removed patches (Fig. 2) consisted of an area
where all post-settlement trees were thinned and removed
from the site, thereby creating an opening in the canopy.
Remnant grass patches (Fig. 2) were located within open
areas where no trees were present and where a representa-
tive sward of native grasses were present. Slope, aspect,
and soil type were generally consistent across patch types,
with the major difference being quantity and quality of
canopy cover of overstory pine trees.
Patch types were not equally represented throughout
the study area. Remnant grass patches occupied only 9%
of the study area, leaving 91% dominated by trees. Prior
to treatment, stands of post-settlement trees were the
dominant patch type (70%). After treatment, the largest
patch type in the study area was the post-settlement
removed patch, which occupied 47% of the study area.
Post-settlement retained and pre-settlement patches occu-
pied roughly equal amounts of area, intermediate to the
remnant grass and post-settlement retained patches.
Pretreatment data were collected in 1992. In 1993, thin-
ning resulted in the removal of 2,226 trees/ha. All pre-
settlement trees and trees greater than 40.6-cm diameter
at breast height were retained. In addition, 5–15 smaller
diameter trees were retained to replace stumps, snags, and
downed logs and recreate the clumped pattern of the pre-
settlement forest (White 1985; Edminster & Olsen 1996;
Covington et al. 1997). Pine basal area was reduced by
45% in the post-settlement retained patches and by 95%
in the post-settlement removed patches. The ﬁrst pre-
scribed burn was implemented in October 1994 (after data
collection in that year), with subsequent burns in October
1998 and October 2002.
Herbaceous standing crop data were collected in 1992
(pre-treatment), 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2002, and
2004. Field sampling occurred during a 2-week period in
mid-September, which is the time of peak aboveground
production and ﬂowering for major understory species in
northern Arizona (Clary 1975). We sampled two 1-m2 (0.5
3 2.0 m) quadrats per plot. All live herbaceous vegetation
rooted in the quadrats was clipped at ground level. Quad-
rats were arranged in a wagon-wheel conﬁguration around
the plot center, and clipping was rotated each year so that
the same piece of land was not sampled 2 years in a row.
In 1992, standing crop was separated into graminoid and
forb functional groups. From 1994 to 2004, herbaceous veg-
etation was separated into C3 and C4 graminoid, legume,
nonleguminous perennial forb, and nonleguminous annual
(including biennial) forb functional groups. Graminoids
were further separated by species in 1994–2004. Samples
were oven-dried at 70C for 24–48 hr and weighed to the
nearest 0.01 g. Data from the two quadrats per subplot
were averaged together to yield a single value for each
functional group or species on each subplot each year.

Data Analysis
Total standing crop data were analyzed by patch type for
measurement years from 1994 to 2004. Functional group
standing crop data were analyzed for measurement years
from 1994 to 2004, as was standing crop of each of the ﬁve
most abundant graminoid species (F. arizonica, M. montana,
E. elymoides, C. geophila, and P. fendleriana). The other
graminoid species were found on less than 25% of the plot-
years, which made them unsuitable for individual analysis.
Herbaceous standing crop data did not meet assump-
tions of equal variance or normality so were ln (x 1 1)
transformed prior to all analyses. Transformations were
mostly successful in stabilizing variances and in promoting
normal distributions, though slight deviations remained
for a few variables. Because analysis of variance (ANOVA)
has been shown to be robust to slight deviations from
assumptions, we used ANOVA in every case for simplicity
rather than report nonparametric tests for the few varia-
bles that deviated slightly from the assumptions. All tests
were conducted at a ¼ 0.05 using JMP-IN software (ver-
sion 5.1.2; SAS 2004). Post-treatment standing crop data
were analyzed using repeated measures multivariate

analysis of variance (MANOVA) with Greenhouse–
Geisser
adjustments
to
account
for
autocorrelation
(Moser et al. 1990). We tested for burn, patch, and time
main effects, patch 3 burn interactions, and patch 3 time
interactions. Burn effects tested for difference between
the thinning and composite treatments. Whole plots were
included as a random blocking factor but were not of
experimental interest and are not reported. Signiﬁcant
patch 3 time interactions indicated that temporal dynam-
ics differed among patches. Signiﬁcant patch effects on
total standing crop were followed by analyses comparing
patches within each year. Signiﬁcant patch effects on func-
tional groups or individual species were followed by analy-
ses comparing patches within the years 1994, 1999, and
2004 (endpoints and midpoint of the study period) to
reduce the number of reported tests. These analyses were
conducted using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s Honestly
signiﬁcant difference multiple comparisons tests. Because
our objectives were not to determine the ‘‘best’’ treatment
or combination of treatments for a particular result, we
followed signiﬁcant interaction effects with tests of single
factors in order to determine in detail how patches differed
within years. In general, the calculated F-statistics were
much smaller for the interaction than for the main effects,
suggesting that the main effects were more important.
Functional group proportions within pre-settlement,
post-settlement retained, and post-settlement removed
patch types were compared with the remnant grass patch
in each year. Functional group proportions were analyzed
with the likelihood ratio (G2) contingency test (Ott &
Longnecker 2001).
We
conducted
nonmetric
multidimensional
scaling
(NMS) ordinations using PC-ORD software (version 4.25;
McCune & Mefford 1999) to illustrate compositional dif-
ferences in the graminoid community between patches
over time (Clarke 1993). Separate ordinations were con-
ducted for functional groups and for graminoid species.
For each ordination, standing crop data were averaged
across the 10 subplots per patch per year to yield a total of
28 data points (four patches within each of the 7 years).
NMS arranges the plots in a conﬁguration that minimizes
the interplot distances (stress). We used the Bray–Curtis
distance measure (Faith et al. 1987) with random starting
conﬁgurations, 100 runs with real data, a maximum of 400
iterations per run, and a stability criterion of 0.00001. A
Monte Carlo test with 9,999 randomizations was used to
determine how likely the observed stress value of the ﬁnal
solution would be by chance alone. Species that occurred
on less than 5% of the plots were omitted from the ordina-
tion (McCune & Grace 2002).
Results
Total Standing Crop
Total herbaceous standing crop varied among patches
and years (Table 1). Standing crop in the remnant grass
patches averaged 800 kg/ha in 1992, whereas standing crop
in other patch types was less than 150 kg/ha (Fig. 3). Stand-
ing crop varied temporally in response to interannual cli-
matic variability (Fig. 1) and spatially in response to patch
type (Fig. 3). Beginning in 1995, standing crop in the post-
settlement removed patches resembled that in remnant
grass patches (Fig. 3). Standing crop in the post-settlement
retained and pre-settlement patches remained less than
that in the remnant grass patches (Fig. 3).
Functional Group Standing Crop
C3 graminoid standing crop varied among patches and
years, but the patch 3 time interaction was not signiﬁcant
(Table 1). C3 graminoid standing crop was similar between
remnant grass and post-settlement removed patches and
much lower in the post-settlement retained and pre-settle-
ment patches (Fig. 4). C4 graminoid standing crop varied
among patches but not among years, but the patch 3 time
interaction was signiﬁcant (Table 1). C4 graminoid stand-
ing crop in the post-settlement removed patches increased
to levels similar to that in remnant grass patches over time
(Fig. 4); this result was driven primarily by increases in
Muhlenbergia montana standing crop.
Legume standing crop varied among patches and
years, and there was a signiﬁcant patch 3 time interac-
tion (Table 1). Legume standing crop was greatest in the
remnant grass patches in 1994 but did not differ from the
other patches in 2002 and 2004 (Fig. 4). However, there
was a signiﬁcant burn effect on legume standing crop
(Table 1), suggesting that ﬁre caused an increase in
legume production. Nonleguminous perennial forb stand-
ing crop varied among patches and years, but there was no
patch 3 time interaction (Table 1). Perennial forb stand-
ing crop was signiﬁcantly lower in pre-settlement patches
than in other patches (Fig. 4). Nonleguminous annual forb
standing crop varied among patches and years, and there
was a signiﬁcant patch 3 time interaction (Table 1).
Annual forb standing crop did not differ among patches in
1994, was highest in the post-settlement removed and post-
settlement retained patches in 1999, and was similar among
post-settlement removed, post-settlement retained, and
grass patches in 2004 (Fig. 4). There was also a signiﬁcant
whole-plot effect for annual standing crop (p ¼ 0.03), sug-
gesting that annual standing crop was spatially variable
(whole-plot effects were not signiﬁcant for other functional
groups).
The NMS ordination (Fig. 5a) illustrates the strong ini-
tial differences in functional group composition among
patches
and
how
post-settlement
removed
patches
became similar to remnant grass patches within two years
of treatment. Relative proportions of functional groups
in pre-settlement, post-settlement retained, and post-
settlement removed patches differed from that in remnant
grass patches most years. However, in 1995 the post-settle-
ment retained patches were similar to the grass patches
(G2 ¼ 2.3, p ¼ 0.686), and in 2002 the post-settlement

removed patches were similar to the grass patches
(G2 ¼ 5.5, p ¼ 0.242).
Graminoid Community
We identiﬁed 15 graminoid species across the study area.
The
analysis
of
graminoid
community
composition
focused on the 11 species found on at least 5% of the
plots. Graminoid community composition differed strongly
among patch types initially (Fig. 5b), and the composition
of post-settlement removed patches became more similar
to that of the grass patches over time. Graminoid composi-
tion exhibited little change in the pre-settlement and post-
settlement retained patches.
Individual Graminoid Species
Patch effects were signiﬁcant for all graminoid species,
but burn effects were not signiﬁcant for any species
(Table 1). Festuca arizonica, M. montana, and Elymus ely-
moides had signiﬁcant patch 3 time interactions. For
example, standing crop of E. elymoides was greatest in
1998 and 1999 in the post-settlement removed patches but
did not change appreciably in other patch types. Festuca

arizonica was most abundant in remnant grass patches
and did not increase appreciably in other patch types over
time (Fig. 6). Muhlenbergia montana was most abundant
in remnant grass patches in 1994; standing crop increased
to similar levels in post-settlement removed patches but
remained low in post-settlement retained and pre-settle-
ment patches (Fig. 6). Elymus elymoides was abundant
in remnant grass, post-settlement removed, and post-
settlement retained patches in 1994. In 1999, it was most
abundant in post-settlement removed and grass patches,
but in 2004 it did not differ among patches (Fig. 6). Carex
geophila was most abundant in remnant grass and post-
settlement removed patches throughout the study (Fig. 6).
Poa fendleriana did not differ in abundance among
patches (Fig. 6).
Discussion
Was the Initial Target Met?
Remnant grass patches were chosen to represent the range
of natural variability of herbaceous vegetation because they
were highly productive, graminoid-dominated patches.
The original restoration target for the ponderosa pine for-
est understory was to increase herbaceous standing crop
to levels found in remnant grass patches. This target was
met in the post-settlement removed patches within two
years of treatment but was not met in the post-settlement
retained or pre-settlement patches, suggesting that small
trees (post-settlement retained) and large trees (pre-settle-
ment) both negatively affected understory standing crop.

47% of the study area, the overall result when patches were
weighted by their areas was a signiﬁcant increase in stand-
ing crop (Moore et al. 2006).
Was the Initial Target Realistic?
In retrospect, it was unrealistic to expect standing crop of
the herbaceous understory to be equal among all patch
types 11 years after treatment. Pine trees intercept light
and precipitation and compete with the understory vege-
tation for soil resources (McLaughlin 1978; Riegel et al.
1995). In addition, pre-settlement patches contain deep lit-
ter and duff layers (Oi 1 a 1e horizons) that likely hinder
tree and herbaceous seedling establishment (Sydes &
Grime 1981; Facelli & Pickett 1991). Duff layers beneath
large pines were likely present in pre-settlement times,
but depths are deeper in contemporary forests after more
than 100 years of litter accumulation (Sackett & Haase
1998). Cooper (1960) suggested that grasses grew up to
the bases of large trees under a frequent ﬁre regime, but
there is little quantitative evidence to support this sugges-
tion. Several studies have demonstrated negative overstory–
understory relationships in contemporary ponderosa pine
forests (Ffolliott 1983; Bojorquez Tapia et al. 1990; Moore
& Deiter 1992; Bakker 2005). Based on the range of
standing crops observed in this patch type, it is unreason-
able to expect herbaceous standing crop to exceed more
than 200 kg/ha within the pre-settlement patch type.
Natural recruitment of herbaceous plants has not occurred
beneath large pines in our study area during this 11-year
post-treatment period, and we do not expect it to occur in
the near future.
Because 45% of pine basal area was removed from the
post-settlement retained patches, we expected a larger
response than was observed in these patches. Apparently,
the remaining trees intercept enough light and moisture to
hinder a herbaceous response (Riegel et al. 1995), particu-
larly during years of below-average precipitation. Open
patches within the pine forest canopy are essential to stim-
ulate recovery of the understory in southwestern ponder-
osa pine forests.
Interannual precipitation clearly plays a role in deter-
mining temporal dynamics of herbaceous standing crop in
semiarid ponderosa pine forests (Fule´ et al. 2002, 2005).
The severe drought of 2002 is clearly evident in the reduc-
tion of standing crop across all patch types. We will
address interannual climatic variation effects on the
understory community more fully in future studies.
Can Functional Group Standing Crop Be a Target?
In a general sense, functional group standing crop can be
used as a realistic target, although functional groups vary
in response by patch type. In post-settlement removed
patches, C3 and C4 graminoid standing crops increased to
levels similar to those of remnant grass patches in a few
years. In post-settlement retained and pre-settlement
patches, C3 and C4 graminoid standing crops did not
change appreciably.
The results for forb functional groups were not as con-
sistent. Legume standing crop remained high in the rem-
nant grass patches and did not increase appreciably within
any other patch type. Nevertheless, legume standing crop
increased in response to burning (Moore et al. 2006),
which corresponds to results found in oak savannas in
Figure 5. NMS ordinations of (a) functional groups and (b) grami-
noid composition among patch types from 1994 to 2004. Arrows
connect data from subsequent measurement years for each patch
type. The NMS of functional groups was determined using the stand-
ing crop of ﬁve functional groups on 28 plots; the ﬁnal solution had
two dimensions; stress ¼ 6.2, p ¼ 0.0099. The NMS of graminoid com-
position was determined using the standing crop of 11 species on 28

Wisconsin (Leach & Givnish 1996) and subalpine forests
in Wyoming (Schoennagel et al. 2004).
Perennial
forb
standing crop
was
similar
among
patches at the beginning of the study, which suggests that
merely maintaining perennial standing crop levels is
a sufﬁcient goal, though future research should address
possible compositional differences of perennial forbs
between patches.
Interestingly, annual forb standing crop did not differ
among patches initially but increased signiﬁcantly in the
post-settlement removed patches. We attribute this to the
greater disturbance caused by tree thinning (and burning
in the composite treatment) in these patches. Some of the
annual (including biennial) standing crop was contributed
by Common mullein (Verbascum thapsus L.), a non-native
species. Native annual species may be important indica-
tors of healthy ponderosa pine forests (Laughlin et al.
2004) but are generally small and contribute minimally to
total standing crop. Therefore, a realistic goal for annual
standing crop should be increasing richness of native
annuals but not necessarily increasing standing crop of
annuals because the productive annual species are often
non-native.
Relative proportions of functional groups are an impor-
tant aspect of the restoration target because we want to
restore both productivity and community composition.
For example, a highly productive patch dominated exclu-
sively by a single species would not be an example of a
successful restoration outcome because a diversity of func-
tional groups is not represented. However, we do not rec-
ommend using relative proportions of functional group
standing crop in the remnant grass patches as a restoration
target unless increased productivity is achieved ﬁrst. This
can be understood by an example. Consider two patches

within years are reported for 1994, 1999, and 2004. Note 10-fold difference in scale of y-axes.

with similar proportions of functional group standing crop
but vastly disparate total standing crop values. For instance,
proportions of functional groups were similar in 1995 be-
tween post-settlement retained and remnant grass patches,
but total standing crop was four times greater in the rem-
nant grass patches. So, although the relative proportions of
functional groups between the patches were the same, the
two patches were not functionally equivalent because pro-
duction levels differed so dramatically. Functional group
composition could be used as a secondary target once the
target for total standing crop has been achieved.
Can the Graminoid Community Be a Target?
Similar to total standing crop, the graminoid community
can be used as a target, with recognition that pre-settlement
and post-settlement retained patches will likely not meet
expectations. Graminoid composition in post-settlement
removed patches shifted toward compositional similarity
with the remnant grass patches over time (Casey 2004).
Can Individual Graminoid Species Be Targets?
Individual graminoid species can be used as restoration
targets, though many species are not common enough to
be used as targets. Of the 15 graminoid species found on
the study area, only ﬁve were abundant enough to be ana-
lyzed. Nevertheless, we expected interspeciﬁc differences
in response because production of native species varies in
response to forest structure and light levels (Naumburg &
DeWald 1999; Naumburg et al. 2001).
Festuca arizonica had the greatest standing crop in the
grass patches at the beginning of the study, so our goal
was to increase its abundance in the other patches. We
expected F. arizonica to increase particularly in the post-
settlement removed patches because it performs well
in high-light environments (Naumburg et al. 2001), but it
did not increase in abundance in any patches. Dispersal
limitation is a problem in many restoration projects
(Verhagen et al. 2001; Donath et al. 2003), but we do not
think F. arizonica was dispersal limited because seed is
produced within the remnant grass patches every year.
This suggests that speciﬁc requirements for seed germina-
tion or seedling establishment and survival of F. arizonica
were not met within the other patch types. Germination
for a similar species, F. idahoensis, has been reported to
occur at 20/15C and 23/4C alternating temperature
cycles (Baskin & Baskin 2001), which are similar to tem-
peratures that occur during the growing season in north-
ern Arizona. Though fescues tend to germinate readily in
greenhouse conditions, it has been noted in the past that
seeding fescue on rangelands was not very successful
(Forsling et al. 1931) and that seeds of F. idahoensis and
F. ovina are not highly germinable (Young et al. 1981).
Alternatively, perhaps simply not enough time has lapsed
since treatment for F. arizonica to establish itself, as it
tends to be more common on undisturbed sites. Consider-
ation of F. arizonica as a target species is warranted
because it is a very important and common C3 bunchgrass
in this system (Naumburg & DeWald 1999; Naumburg
et al. 2001), though further research into establishment
requirements for this grass would be necessary in order to
meet desired goals.
Elymus elymoides is a generalist species that performs
well in high light or dense shade conditions and is one of
the few species that can tolerate dense forest conditions
(Naumburg & DeWald 1999; Naumburg et al. 2001). Ely-
mus elymoides standing crop was equally abundant in
the remnant grass, post-settlement removed, and post-
settlement retained patches at the beginning of the study,
so our goal for this species was to maintain levels of this
grass over time. Elymus elymoides standing crop tended
to be larger in post-settlement removed than in remnant
grass patches, suggesting that it ﬁlled a niche created by
the thinning disturbance in the post-settlement removed
patches. We expected a signiﬁcant response to prescribed
burns because this species appears well adapted to ﬁre
(Wright 1971; Young & Miller 1985; Vose & White 1991),
but did not detect a signiﬁcant burn effect. It appears that
E. elymoides standing crop peaked 5–6 years after the
experimental treatments began, though it is difﬁcult to dis-
tinguish the reduced standing crop in 2002 and 2004 from
drought effects. Because E. elymoides responds favorably
to disturbance, it is an important species in this system
and was likely an important grass in pre-settlement times
when low-intensity ﬁres occurred frequently.
Muhlenbergia montana was the only C4 species included
in these analyses and is generally associated with warm,
sunny openings in the forest (Naumburg & DeWald 1999;
Naumburg et al. 2001). In 1994, M. montana standing crop
was most abundant in the remnant grass patches, so our
goal was to increase M. montana standing crop in other
patches over time. Muhlenbergia montana did increase in
the post-settlement removed patches to levels similar to
that in the remnant grass patches during the period of
study as predicted based on its afﬁnity with high-light
environments, though its standing crop remained low in
the post-settlement retained and pre-settlement patches.
The pre-settlement and post-settlement retained patches
apparently did not provide enough light for this C4 species
to become a dominant graminoid. This species is a very
common grass in open areas in this system and would
therefore serve as a good target species.
Carex geophila remained abundant in the remnant grass
and post-settlement removed patches. Though we cannot
say for sure that C. geophila was not abundant in the post-
settlement removed patches prior to treatment, these data
suggest that C. geophila could be a good target species
because it responded rapidly to the removal of small-
diameter trees.
Poa fendleriana standing crop did not differ among
patches throughout the course of the study and therefore
not a good candidate as a restoration target. However,
both Carex and Poa species are cool-season C3 graminoids
that grow predominantly in spring and early summer, so

we may not have captured their maximum standing crops
when we sampled in September. Future studies might
address sampling date effects for early-season species.
Patch Size
Patch size will have a signiﬁcant effect on the response of
the understory vegetation. For instance, a small opening
within a dense stand of pines will likely not provide the
resources required for a productive understory. Remnant
grass patches only accounted for 9% of the study area,
though Covington et al. (1997) suggest that grass openings
were larger and more frequent in pre-settlement times.
Thus, prescriptions designed to emulate pre-settlement
forest structure (Fule´ et al. 1997; Mast et al. 1999; Moore
et al. 2004) would therefore likely create openings that are
large enough to permit positive responses by the herba-
ceous vegetation. We did not sample the patch types in
proportion to each patch type’s abundance because we
used a balanced experimental design; therefore, we sam-
pled remnant grass patches with greater intensity than
other patch types. We do not think this biased our results
because sampling error was actually smaller in the other
patch types compared with the remnant grass patches.
Pre-settlement patches averaged 0.055 ha in size (range
0.02–0.11 ha), within the range of old-growth group sizes
reported
previously
(0.02–0.29
ha
in
White
[1985];
0.06–0.13 ha in Cooper [1960]). Patch size and shape are
important elements of landscape-scale forest structure
and should be addressed in future studies.
Conclusions
We conclude by commenting on the recommended list of
key processes in restoration ecology that are needed for
successful integration of restoration into land manage-
ment (Hobbs & Norton 1996). We recognize that ﬁre
exclusion and other factors contributed to the irruption of
pine densities in the early 1900s and have led to drastic
ecosystem degradation in ponderosa pine–bunchgrass
communities in northern Arizona (Covington & Moore
1994). Therefore, we have developed treatments that
include the thinning of post-settlement trees to emulate
pre-settlement forest structure (Mast et al. 1999) and the
reintroduction of surface ﬁres to reverse this degradation
(Moore et al. 1999). Realistic goals for this system are the
reduction of tree densities to levels found prior to Euro-
American settlement and increased herbaceous productiv-
ity (Covington et al. 1997). Implementing restoration
treatments over large scales can be costly but may be cost-
effective compared with ﬁre suppression costs (Snider
et al. 2003). High costs are currently a major hindrance
to landscape-scale forest restoration in the Southwest.
Easily observable measures of success include pine den-
sity and pine basal area and herbaceous standing crop or
percent cover. Targets can be met on a landscape-scale
through site-speciﬁc thinning prescriptions and use of pre-
scribed ﬁre, and these restoration prescriptions have been
incorporated into suggested management strategies for
land-use agencies across the Southwest (Friederici 2003).
Thinning treatments have reduced tree densities and
thereby reduced the probability of catastrophic ﬁre (Cov-
ington et al. 2001), and have also increased herbaceous
standing crop (Moore et al. 2006). However, an important
ﬁnding in this study is that forest patch types do not
respond equally to restoration treatments, at least not
within a decade of treatment. Indeed, patch effects were
stronger than treatment effects in this project (Table 1;
Moore et al. 2006), suggesting that treatment response
varies considerably among patches. Patch size and shape
are the building blocks of landscape-scale forest structure
in this system. This perspective can guide the development
of forest structure prescriptions and measurement criteria
for other restoration projects where long-term monitoring
is implemented. This study suggests that herbaceous
standing crop will likely remain low beneath pre-settle-
ment and remaining post-settlement trees within the ﬁrst
decade of a restoration project. If increasing herbaceous
production is a primary goal of a restoration effort, then
prescriptions that create a heterogeneous forest structure
with large openings will maximize success. Because this
study was limited to a study site on basalt soils at approxi-
mately 2,200 m in elevation, these results should be con-
ﬁrmed on other soil types or in other regions of the pine
forest ecosystem; therefore, we caution extrapolating
these results to all ponderosa pine forests. Further, moni-
toring at this long-term research site will continue to
assess understory production in all patches, focus on func-
tional group and interspeciﬁc differences in response, and
address climatic effects on the understory community.
