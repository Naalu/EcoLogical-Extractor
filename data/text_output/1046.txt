Cross-Boundary Workshop Brings Together Western
Land Managers and Collaborative Restoration
Partners  
Different land owners and agency land managers are working together to better
manage and protect forested landscapes across thousands of acres in the
West. Each program and project has its challenges, unique approaches, and
own successes. 
 
In an effort to continue building successful restoration programs and projects
that work collaboratively across jurisdictional boundaries, the Ecological
Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University—along with its two sister
institutes from Colorado State University and New Mexico Highlands University
—held a three-day Cross-Boundary Landscape Restoration Workshop in

Albuquerque in early March 2020.
 
More than 150 land management representatives from 55 federal and state
agencies, non-proﬁts, environmental groups, universities, and community
collaboratives came together to share success stories and lessons-learned and
also to develop strategies for advancing collaborative landscape-scale forest
restoration across the intermountain West.
 
Participants from across the West gathered to discuss new tools and strategies
that help managers foster robust collaborative groups, integrate science
information into collaborative planning, and translate planning documents into
on-the-ground results. Chief of the US Forest Service Vicki Christiansen and
New Mexico State Forester, Laura McCarthy provided keynote addresses, both
noting that while collaborative cross-boundary work is difﬁcult, it leads to better
outcomes for people and ecosystems.
 
Workshop Highlight: Structuring Adaptive Management for the Long-Term
 
On the third day of the workshop, a session on adaptive management featured
talks from ERI Sr. Program Coordinator Bryce Esch, Forest Stewards Guild
Deputy Director Eytan Krasilovsky, and The Wilderness Society’s Senior
Science Director Greg Aplet. Speakers and workshop attendees discussed the
challenges faced in adaptive management, including turnover in decision-
makers, communication gaps between collaborators and implementors, and
limited capacity of managers and partners with technical expertise in
monitoring. 
 
Participants shared successes and examples of adaptive management, such
as collaborative members and managers coming together to adapt
prescriptions based on partner concerns for outcomes that everyone could
agree on. Breakout groups identiﬁed next steps that collaborators could take
together with the Southwest Ecological Restoration Institutes to improve
adaptive management, including increasing coordination across forests and
projects to share data and approaches and having more venues for peer-to-
peer learning.

Boundary organizations are organizations that bridge scientists and managers
by facilitating interaction and communication, delivering the existing science,
and co-developing new science relevant to management questions. This paper
examines how one boundary organization focused on ﬁre management has
shifted its focus over time to address the needs of its ﬁre manager audience.

Harvesting methods such as whole-tree (WT) and tree-length (TL) harvest
directly affect the productivity and cost of fuel reduction thinning on steep
slopes (>35%), especially in felling and yarding operations. A standard time
study was performed to better understand key factors determining operational
cost differences between WT and TL skyline thinning operations.

Researchers reconstructed historical ﬁre regimes and landscape structure at
ponderosa pine-dominated sites spanning a range of environmental conditions
on the Prescott and Tonto national forests. There was strong evidence of
historical surface ﬁre regimes with mean ﬁre intervals ranging 1.3–15.6 years
across the ﬁve study sites during the period 1700–1879. Researchers found
very little evidence of historical high-severity ﬁre at any study site.

This working paper provides a summary of the current literature on the
interaction of forest soils and ﬁre in southwestern frequent-ﬁre forests. It details
how forest soils are both responsive and robust. Impacts of restoration
treatments and ﬁres on soils depend strongly on site-speciﬁc details. There is
no one-size-ﬁts-all prescription because too many factors make forest soils
complex and variable.

Tribal Forestry Student Summit — Oct. 6–8, 2020
The Ecological Restoration Institute and the School of Forestry are hosting
the 2nd Tribal Forestry Student Summit this October on the Northern Arizona
University campus. The summit is designed to strengthen tribal forestry
workforce development and will include professional educators and foresters
from summit partners, including the Intertribal Timber Council, Salish-Kootenai
College, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the US Forest Service–Region 3.
 
The summit will convene professional and aspiring tribal natural resource
managers over a three-day period featuring panel discussions, ﬁeld trips,
poster sessions, and an interactive format that will provide summit participants
a clear vision of current issues and the future of tribal natural resource
management.
 
The planning committee has agreed to move forward with the summit this fall
as planned. Please mark your calendar for Oct. 6–8, 2020. Information about
the summit, including updates, summit agenda, participant application process,
and ways to provide support, can be accessed here.
