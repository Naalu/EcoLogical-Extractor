Abstract.
Fire regimes were reconstructed from fire-scarred trees on five large forested study sites (135–810 ha)
on the North and South Rims at Grand Canyon National Park. Adequacy of sampling was tested with cumulative
sample curves, effectiveness of fire recording on individual trees, tree age data, and the occurrence of 20th Century
fires which permitted comparison of fire-scar data with fire-record data, a form of modern calibration for the
interpretation of fire-scar results. Fire scars identified all 13 recorded fires >8 ha on the study sites since 1924,
when record keeping started. Records of fire season and size corresponded well with fire-scar data. We concluded
that the sampling and analysis methods were appropriate and accurate for this area, in contrast to the suggestion
that these methods are highly uncertain in ponderosa pine forests. Prior to 1880, fires were most frequent on low-
elevation ‘islands’ of ponderosa pine forest formed by plateaus or points (Weibull Median Probability Intervals
[WMPI] 3.0–3.9 years for all fires, 6.3–8.6 years for ‘large’ fires scarring 25% or more of the sampled trees). Fires
were less frequent on a higher-elevation ‘mainland’ site located further to the interior of the North Rim (WMPI
5.1 years all fires, 8.7 years large fires), but fires tended to occur in relatively drier years and individual fires
were more likely to burn larger portions of the study site. In contrast to the North Rim pattern of declining fire
frequency with elevation, a low-elevation ‘mainland’ site on the South Rim had the longest fire-free intervals prior
to European settlement (WMPI 6.5 years all fires, 8.9 years large fires). As in much of western North America,
surface fire regimes were interrupted around European settlement, 1879 on the North Rim and 1887 on the South
Rim. However, either two or three large surface fires have burned across each of the geographically remote point and
plateau study sites of the western North Rim since settlement.To some extent, these sites may be rare representatives
of nearly-natural conditions due to the relatively undisrupted fire regimes in a never-harvested forest setting.

Introduction
Fire scars on a tree, if correctly identified as originating
from fire and cross-dated to the exact year of the injury,
provide incontrovertible evidence of the past occurrence of
fire at the tree’s location. Since fire-scarred trees persist
for hundreds to thousands of years, they have been funda-
mental to understanding past fire disturbance regimes (e.g.
Swetnam 1993). In ponderosa pine and closely related forests
across western North America, fire regimes reconstructed
from fire scars have been remarkably consistent in find-
ing frequent fire recurrence with mean fire return intervals
of 2–25 years (Swetnam and Baisan 1996; Baker and Ehle
2001; Heyerdahl et al. 2001). Together with other histori-
cal, photographic, relict site, and paleoecological evidence,
these studies have contributed to the interpretation of an
evolutionary environment in which frequent, low-intensity
fire maintained relatively open forests dominated by large
trees and diverse, productive understory vegetation (Cooper
1960; Moore et al. 1999). Current recommendations for eco-
logical restoration and ecosystem management of forests
are therefore based in large part on fire-scar studies (e.g.
Swetnam and Baisan 1996; Kaufmann et al. 1998). The
choice of management policy is important since large and
intense wildfires in ponderosa pine forests have been increas-
ingly costly and are perceived as ecologically destructive
(Covington 2000).
Recently the basic premises of fire-scar sampling and
interpretation have been questioned (Johnson and Gutsell
1994; Fall 1998; Minnich et al. 2000; Baker and Ehle 2001).
Although the presence of a fire scar is evidence of fire, the

absence of a scar does not prove that fire did not occur.
Therefore the scattering of point-locations (fire-scarred trees)
over a landscape leaves the areal extent of the fire(s) burn-
ing between these points uncertain (Minnich et al. 2000).
Second, fire return intervals are longer if one considers the
average of fire intervals per tree rather than the composite
of fire intervals per site (Baker and Ehle 2001). Third, the
common practice of seeking out trees with multiple scars
and long records of fire has been criticized as non-random
sampling leading to biased results because of spatial segre-
gation of sample trees, inadequate sample depth, or simply
missed fires (Johnson and Gutsell 1994; Fall 1998). As a
consequence, Johnson and Gutsell (1994: 268) argued that
essentially all fire-scar studies to date were ‘not arrived at by
a statistically valid sampling design, [so] it is impossible to
know how accurate and precise the calculations are’.
Accurate information about fire occurrence over long
periods in ecosystems with surface and mixed-severity fire
regimes is usually limited to fire-scar interpretation because
fire records or ‘fire atlas’ data are usually short, incom-
plete, and overlap with modern fire-exclusion periods. Grand
Canyon National Park is a unique area in which to measure
patterns of fire disturbance on large landscapes because it
includes rare examples of south-western forests with 20th
Century fires, allowing the use of historical fire records since
1924 to assess the validity of fire-scar analysis methods. The
rims of Grand Canyon National Park support the largest area
ofnever-harvestedforestinArizona,approximately50 000 ha
of ponderosa pine and higher elevation forests (Warren et al.
1982). Livestock grazing was eliminated early in the 20th
Century and there are few roads. Although complete fire
suppression was official policy for most of the past cen-
tury, the difficult access to remote sites limited firefighting
capabilities.
It is useful to reconstruct fire regimes over large land-
scapes because variability in fire disturbance interacts with
vegetation over geographic and elevational gradients to create
complex landscape patterns (e.g. Romme and Knight 1981;
Veblen et al. 1992). Geographic ‘islands’ such as isolated
mesas or peninsulas affect the spread of contagious processes
such as fire (Turner et al. 1989), suggesting that the fire fre-
quency in isolated forest patches would probably be less than
that of similar vegetation on ‘mainland’forests. This hypoth-
esis was supported at Zion National Park in Utah, where
Madany and West (1983) found that a ponderosa pine for-
est on a small (150 ha) mesa had a pre-European mean fire
return interval (MFI—all fires included) of 69 years, up to 10
times longer than a nearby large plateau and far longer than
any other south-western ponderosa site. Another site with
relatively long MFI (16.5 years—all fires included), Hidden
Kipuka at El Malpais National Monument, New Mexico, is an
island-likepatchofforestsurroundedbylavaflows(Grissino-
Mayer 1995). But forested islands in a Quebec lake burned
more frequently than the lakeshore, although with smaller
fires (Bergeron 1991) and fires were more frequent and
smaller on an isolated mountain range on the Idaho/Montana
border than on large contiguous ranges (Murray et al. 1998).
Elevational gradients influence fire by affecting fuel
moisture, ignition potential, and vegetation composition and
productivity (i.e. the amount and arrangement of biomass
available for burning). Productivity and biomass generally
increase with higher moisture availability at increasing eleva-
tion (Gosz 1992). In southern Arizona, for example, biomass
rose from 162 to 250 Mg/ha in ponderosa pine forests around
2200 m elevation to 357 Mg/ha in mixed conifer forest around
2700 m elevation (Whittaker and Niering 1975). Despite the
abundant quantity of fuel at higher elevations, pre-European
fire frequencies across the Southwest tended to decrease with
increased elevation, probably limited by higher fuel moisture
andrelativelycompactsurfacefuelbeds(duetoshort-needled
conifers) at higher elevations (Touchan et al. 1996; Brown
et al. 2001).
On a geographic and elevational gradient starting from
remote canyon rim sites into the mainland of the Kaibab and
Coconino Plateaus, we asked the following questions:
(1) Did fire-scar methods accurately reconstruct fire history,
as compared with historical fire records?
(2) How did fire regimes change, in terms of fire fre-
quency, size, and climate-fire relationships, over the geo-
graphic/elevational gradient prior to recent fire regime
disruption associated with European settlement?
(3) After European settlement, did the fire regime of sporadic
burns on remote North Rim sites maintain a near-natural
disturbance pattern?
Methods
Study sites
We chose to sample large landscapes over an elevational and
biogeographical gradient in order to capture large-scale fire
patterns. This choice limited the scope of inference to the
study region. An alternative approach, of sampling smaller
replicated stands, could have provided estimates of variabil-
ity in fire regime statistics. This approach was not selected
for two reasons: first, the great majority of south-western
fire histories have focused on stands or even smaller scales
(Swetnam and Baisan 1996), not necessarily providing the
most useful information for landscape-scale ecosystem man-
agement.Second,thelargearealextentoffiresasdocumented
in this study and others (e.g. Rollins et al. 2000) means
that ‘replicated’ stands in a contiguous forested region are
not actually independent, having shared numerous fires, so
a statistical treatment based on presumed replication and
extrapolation of results would be inappropriate. Ultimately,
repeated landscape-scale studies at numerous sites will pro-
vide the most robust understanding of the variability and
generality of fire patterns (Heyerdahl et al. 2001).

Using fire records and field reconnaissance, we identi-
fied the three remote areas on the north-western edge of the
North Rim where fire regimes were the least disrupted by
fire management. ‘Least disruption’ was defined by man-
agement history, not by fire-scarred tree density or tree age.
Four sites representing a biogeographical gradient (island
[Powell Plateau] →peninsula [Rainbow Plateau, Fire Point]
→mainland [Swamp Ridge]) were selected on the North
Rim (Table 1; Fig. 1). Elevation increased along the gradient
from 2256 m (ponderosa pine/Gambel oak forest) to 2537 m
(mixed conifer forest). To distinguish geographic from ele-
vational effects, we also selected a low-elevation (2264 m)
pine/oak mainland site at Grandview on the South Rim.
Although the total elevational change was small (∼300 m),
theNorthRimstudysitesweresituateddirectlyoverthemajor
transition from ponderosa pine to mixed conifer forest. The
total study site area was 1755 ha. All the sites were within
Grand Canyon National Park, except 207 ha of the southern
portion of the Grandview site, in the Kaibab National Forest.
Within each study site, vegetation and topography were rela-
tively homogeneous and there were no natural barriers to fire
spread within sites.
Soil information was derived from an ongoing soil survey
(A. Dewall, National Resource Conservation Service, per-
sonal communication 2002). Soils at the North Rim sites were
tentatively classified as Typic Paleustalfs. Soils at the Grand-
view site were classified asVertic Paleustalfs and Haplustalfs,
clay soils weathered from calcareous sandstone parent mate-
rial. Average annual precipitation at the North Rim ranger
station (elevation 2564 m) is 64.7 cm, with an average annual
snowfall of 356 cm. Temperatures range from an average
July maximum of 25.1◦C to an average January minimum
of −8.2◦C. At the South Rim (elevation 2070 m), aver-
age annual precipitation is 44.0 cm with an average annual
snowfall of 177.6 cm; average July maximum temperature is
28.9◦C and average January minimum temperature is −8.2◦C
(Western Regional Climate Center, www.wrcc.dri.edu). For-
est vegetation included ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var.
scopulorum P. & C. Larson), Gambel oak (Quercus gambellii
Nutt.), and New Mexican locust (Robinia neomexicana Gray)
trees,withanunderstoryofforbsandperennialgrasses.Atthe
higher-elevation Swamp Ridge site, oak and locust were not
encountered but white fir (Abies concolor (Gord. & Glen.)
Hoopes.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca
(Mirb.) Franco), and aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.)
were found. All sites were dominated by ponderosa pine.
Although the contemporary vegetation at Swamp Ridge was
a mix of species, dendroecological reconstruction of the site
showed that pine comprised 75% of the basal area in 1879, the
year of the last widespread fire at the site (Fulé et al. 2002).
Native Americans populated the lower elevations of the
canyon rims until a regional abandonment around A.D.
1250–1300 (Altschul and Fairley 1989). On Wahalla Plateau
(eastern North Rim, similar in elevation and vegetation to
Powell Plateau, Rainbow Plateau, and Fire Point), Schwartz
et al. (1981: 126) stated that ‘fairly intensive use of the
area is unquestionable’, even though precise population num-
bers could not be estimated from the archeological evidence.
We encountered ruins on most of the ridges on Powell and
Rainbow Plateaus. Several tribes, including the Paiute, Hopi,
Havasupai, Hualapai, Navajo, and Zuni, have ancestral and
current connections to the rim habitat.
European settlement of southern Utah was begun by Mor-
mon pioneers in 1854 but fighting with Utes and Navajos
kept them out of the Kaibab plateau until 1869. European
settlement on the South Rim began around 1885 with home-
steading, construction of the first tourist hotel (near the
Grandview study site), and prospecting (Verkamp 1940). Sur-
face fire regimes were disrupted in forested highlands as early
as 1870 in the MtTrumbull area (P.Z. Fulé, unpublished data),
about 85 km west of the Kaibab Plateau, and between 1876
and 1883 in the Flagstaff area, about 100 km south-east of the
Grandview site (Dieterich 1980; Fulé etal. 1997). Early live-
stock grazing was excessive (Altschul and Fairley 1989) and
removed fine herbaceous fuels, limiting fire spread across
most of the Southwest (Dieterich 1980; Savage and Swetnam
1990).
Grand Canyon Forest Reserve was designated in 1893, fol-
lowed by creation of Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP)
in 1919. In North Rim forests, Wolf and Mast (1998) found
complete fire exclusion by about 1920. Livestock were fenced
out of the North Rim by 1938 (M. Schroeder, GCNP arche-
ologist, personal communication, 1999). Park management
policy advocates restoration of natural ecological processes,

was
done
in
October–
November 1997, at the Grandview and northern Swamp
Ridge sites, and June–July 1998, at the three remaining
sites. Sampling was completed at the southern portion of the
Swamp Ridge site in July and September 1999. The intent of
sampling was to obtain as complete as possible an inventory
of fire dates and point locations (i.e. scarred tree locations)
where these fires occurred (Swetnam and Baisan 1996). We
reconstructed comprehensive fire histories over large study
areas. Each study site was completely surveyed along par-
allel transects to observe all fire-scarred trees. Trees with
the longest series of fire scars were selected, an example
of ‘targeted’ sampling (Baker and Ehle 2001). Partial cross-
sections were cut from scarred ‘catfaces’ on trees, logs, and
stumpsofconifers. Samplesweremappedwhencollectedand
were well-distributed throughout the study areas (Fig. 1). In a
companion study, we measured vegetation, tree age structure,

and fuels on 0.1-ha plots located on a 300 × 300 m sampling
grid at the same study sites (Fulé et al. 2002).
Dendrochronology
In the lab, samples were mounted, surfaced with fine-
grit sandpaper, and cross-dated (Stokes and Smiley 1968)
using characteristic patterns of narrow marker years: 1722,
29, 35, 48, 52, 72, 82; 1810, 13, 20, 22, 45, 47, 73, 79,
96, 99; 1902, 04, 51, 63, 77, 96. All dates were indepen-
dently confirmed by another dendrochronologist. The season
of fire occurrence (Baisan and Swetnam 1990) was estimated
based on the relative position of each fire lesion within the
annual ring according to the following categories: EE (early
earlywood), ME (middle earlywood), LE (late earlywood),
L (latewood), and D (dormant). Dormant season scars were
assigned to the year of the following earlywood (i.e. spring
fires), as conventionally done in the Southwest (Baisan and
Swetnam 1990).
Sampling adequacy
Since fire scars are recognized as minimum recorders of
fire occurrence (some fires leave no scars: Dieterich and
Swetnam 1984), the adequacy of field sampling was tested
by examining the cumulative fire dates added by successive
samples in random order at each study site. In a manner anal-
ogous to a species–area curve, the number of new fire dates
would be expected to reach a plateau before all fire-scarred
samples were included if the sampling had in fact captured
all of the fires. In contrast, if the number of new fire dates
rose proportionally with the addition of new samples, then the
sampling would have been inadequate to inventory the fires.
The value of multiple-recording fire-scar samples was also
tested at each site by selecting the best (most scars per sam-
ple) and worst (fewest scars per sample) 10% of recorders in
each sample set, comparing the number and proportion of fire
years captured by each group. Since tree bark typically grows
thicker with age, the ability of a scarred tree to record fires
might decrease given a long fire-free period (although note
that all of our sampled trees had open ‘catfaces’or scars; none
had completely healed over). If this were true, the sampling
of the oldest possible recording trees could be biased against
recent fires that would be recorded on younger trees with
thinner bark (Baker and Ehle 2001). We tested this hypoth-
esis by calculating the proportion of recorders that covered
long gaps, many decades to over a century.
In some forests where stand-replacing fires occurred
together with surface fires, it has been suggested that the
primary ecological role of fire is carried out by infrequent,
relatively severe burns, while the more frequent burns
recorded on scarred trees are considered to be limited in
area and/or impact (Johnson and Gutsell 1994; Shinneman
and Baker 1997; Kipfmueller and Baker 2000; Minnich et al.
2000; Baker and Ehle 2001). In such a situation, the use of
fire-scarred trees to determine fire history could overestimate
the occurrence of fires that alter stand structure. The study
sites were relatively homogeneous in vegetation type (Warren
et al. 1982) and aerial photos as well as field reconnaissance
showed no large patches (>1–2 ha) that might have originated
from stand-replacing fires. The fire-scarred trees themselves
are multi-century fire survivors, indicating that no fire caus-
ing complete mortality had crossed the study sites over the
analysis period.At a finer scale, we examined the distribution
of minimum tree ages from the companion vegetation study
(Fulé et al. 2002).
Fire data analysis
Data were analysed with FHX2 software (Grissino-Mayer
1995). Analysis at each site began with the first year with an
adequate sample depth, defined as the first fire year recorded
by 10% or more of the total sample size of recording trees
at each site (Grissino-Mayer et al. 1994). ‘Recording’ trees
are those with open fire scars or other injuries (e.g. lightning
scars), leaving them susceptible to repeated scarring by fire.
Agee (1993) described the mechanisms by which trees record
multiple scars (resinous deposits, exposed dead wood, and
thin bark next to the wound).
Fire return intervals were analysed statistically in different
sub-categories that are related to the size and/or intensity of
past fires. The size of past fires in frequent-fire ecosystems
cannot be precisely reconstructed because most overstory
treessurvivesuchfires, precludingfirehistorymethodsbased
on stand ages and stand mapping. However, Swetnam and
Baisan (1996) argued that fire years in which only one or two
samples were scarred probably represented relatively small
fires, while fire years in which a greater proportion of samples
were scarred represented relatively larger fires. Accordingly,
the fire data were filtered to look at progressively greater pro-
portional scarring. First, all fire years, even those represented
by a single scar, were considered. Then only those fire years
were included in which respectively 10% or more, and 25%
or more, of the recording samples were scarred.
The statistical analysis of fire return intervals includes
several measures of central tendency: the mean fire interval
(MFI, average number of years between fires); the median;
and theWeibull median probability interval (WMPI).The lat-
ter statistic is a measure of central tendency in the Weibull
distribution, used to model asymmetric fire interval distri-
butions and to express fire return intervals in probabilistic
terms (Swetnam and Baisan 1996; Grissino-Mayer 2000).
Since fire return intervals are rarely normally distributed,
the WMPI may be preferred over the MFI, although the val-
ues are often numerically similar. Regional fire occurrence
among the North Rim sites was analysed from 1700 to the
present. Fires within sites were analysed in the all-scar and
25%-scar categories, to examine possible differences in fire
regime between smaller and larger fires.
Comparison of data across different-sized study sites
could be problematic because more scars recording small

134
P. Z. Fulé et al.
fires might be included in larger study sites (Agee 1993;
Swetnam and Baisan 1996). At 810 ha, the Grandview study
area was six times larger than the smallest area sampled, Fire
Point. To test the sensitivity of the Grandview fire regime to
sampling area, we divided the sample set into geographically
distinct quarters, divided N–S and E–W, and fire frequen-
cies of the quarters were compared. At the regional scale, the
occurrence of simultaneous or wide-spreading fires across
the western North Rim between sites was compared in three
categories: all fire years (fire at any site); fire years at 50% or
more of the sites; and fire years represented at 75% or more
of the sites.
To see whether fire return intervals had changed over time
before European settlement, the fire records prior to recent
fire exclusion were divided into earlier and later halves at
each study site and compared. Fire distributions were tested
for significantly different means (t-test), variances (F-test),
and distributions (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test). Alpha level
for all tests was 0.05. In addition, the spatial homogeneity of
fires was investigated by dividing each site into geographic
halves and testing the synchroneity of fire years (χ2 tests,
2 × 2 and 2 × 1 contingency tables [Grissino-Mayer 1995]).
Climate
The relationship between climatic fluctuations and fire
occurrence was compared with superposed epoch analy-
sis (SEA), using software developed by Grissino-Mayer
(1995). A locally developed tree-ring chronology served as
a proxy for climate (19 ponderosa pine trees from Powell
Plateau, Rainbow Plateau, and Fire Point, master series
1559–1997, series intercorrelation = 0.70, average mean
sensitivity = 0.34). The chronology was significantly cor-
related with reconstructed Palmer Drought Severity Index
(r = 0.67) for grid point 31 in northern Arizona, A.D. 1694–
1978 (Cook et al. 1996). The SEA superimposes fire years
and summarizes the climate variable for fire years as well as
preceding and succeeding years. Confidence intervals were
developed using bootstrapping methods with 1000 simula-
tions based on random windows with the actual fire events.
Reconstructed positive or negative extreme years of the
Southern Oscillation Index (Stahle and Cleaveland 1993),
which has been shown to be associated with fire activity in the
Southwest (Swetnam and Betancourt 1990) were also com-
pared with years in which fires burned at a majority of the
Grand Canyon study sites.
Fire records
At Grand Canyon, many fires occurred during the 20th
Century, permitting us to test the accuracy of the fire-scar
record using fire records back to 1924. In contrast, the lands
where the majority of south-western fire history studies have
been carried out have good fire records but few or no 20th
Century fires (Swetnam and Baisan 1996). Some forests in
northern Mexico have had many 20th Century fires, but the
written fire records are inadequate for comparison (Fulé and
Covington 1997, 1999).
The fire-record data were used with caution. The histor-
ical data were patchy in the early years, so the observed
long-term trend toward increasing fire occurrence may be
a real phenomenon or may be due to increasingly sophis-
ticated detection methods and better record-keeping. Many
recorded fire sizes and geographic locations were considered
approximate and some evident errors were observed, such
as coordinates that placed fires well outside the park bound-
aries. Nonetheless, the database was a valuable independent
source of fire history information. After completing the fire-
scar analysis without reference to the database, we selected
records of fires occurring in and around (within 1 km) the
study sites for comparison with the fire-scar data.
Results
Sampling adequacy
Cumulative sample curves (Fig. 2a) showed that 100% of
fire dates were captured with less than 100% of samples at
all study sites. Fifty percent of the samples recorded 94% of
fires at Grandview, 72% at Fire Point, 78% at Powell Plateau,
86% at Rainbow Plateau, and 84% at Swamp Ridge. The top
10% of recording samples averaged 68% of the total number
of fire dates, while the bottom 10% of samples averaged only
17% (Table 2). Fire-scarred sample depth over time is shown
in Fig. 2b and summarized in Table 1.
Bark thickening or other changes with age did not degrade
the ability of trees with open, unhealed scars to record fires, as
many were scarred before and after long fire-free intervals,
so there is no evidence that selection of old trees for sam-
pling would cause recent fires to be missed. At Fire Point, 20
recorders of 25 potentially recording sample trees (80%) cov-
ered the 44 year fire-free gap from 1879 to 1923 and 100%
(4 recorders/4 potential) covered the 66 year gap from 1923
to 1989 (fire-free gaps are shown in Fig. 3).At Powell Plateau,
14/24 (58%) of trees recorded over the combination of fire-
free gaps from 1892/1895/1923/1924 to 1986/1987/1988. At
Rainbow Plateau, 4/7 (57%) recorded over the 1900–1970
gap and 12/17 (71%) over the 1900–1985 gap. The longest
fire-free periods were encountered at Grandview, where 8/11
(73%) recorded over the gap between 1887 and the fires in
1981/1985/1986.
Minimum ages of trees in plots on a 300 × 300 m grid
across each study site predated 1800 on an average of 72%
of plots and predated 1700 on an average of 20% of plots
(Table 3).The exception was the previously harvested Kaibab
National Forest portion of the Grandview site, where only
22% of plots had trees predating 1800.
Comparison of fire-scar data with fire records
Fire scars were highly accurate in identifying historical fires:

8ha since 1924 was identified from fire scars (Table 4).Wild-
fires, prescribed natural fires, and prescribed fires—differing
in season and arguably also in intensity—were all correctly
identified.The largest fire recorded in the database but missed
in the fire-scar reconstruction was an 8-ha prescribed nat-
ural fire on the Rainbow Plateau (6/87). Numerous small
fires suppressed at sizes of 0.04–0.4 ha did not show up in
the fire-scar record. For example, approximately 25 fires of
1 ha or smaller in size were documented in historical records
on the Powell Plateau study area since 1924. (The number
of fires is approximate because of possible inaccuracies in
recorded locations; other clues, such as fire names, were also
used to assess whether a fire’s recorded location may have
been incorrect). The proportion of scarred trees was gener-
ally related to recorded fire size [see Fulé et al. (2000) for
a graphical comparison of fire-scarred sample locations to
mapped fire size for the Emerald fire on Rainbow Plateau
(8/93, 138 ha)]. The greatest discrepancy between fire size
and scarring proportion occurred with the 1931 Fire Point
fire; it burned 65 ha (some of which may have been below the
rim) but was recorded only on a single scarred sample. Season
of fire occurrence, as identified on the fire-scarred samples,
corresponded well with the recorded fire dates (Table 4). A
few fires represented by dormant season scars were moved
back a calendar year, as notedin the Grandview sectionbelow.
Several fire scars did not correspond to any fire records, such
as a 1950 fire that scarred a single sample tree on Powell
Plateau. In other cases, there was a discrepancy between the
scar sample location and the mapped fire location. For exam-
ple, a 2-ha fire occurred near the north-eastern corner of
Powell Plateau in June, 1953, according to the database. We
found a single sample scarred in 1953 located approximately

Fire history results are summarized in these graphs, with each horizontal line representing the composite of all
sampled trees on a site and the short vertical lines noting the year of fire occurrence. Fire regimes are compared in three
categories: all fires, including even those which scarred only a single sample tree (top graph); fires scarring 10% or more
of the sample trees on each site (middle graph); and fires scarring 25% or more of the sample trees (bottom graph).

1 km to the south-west of the database fire location. The ear-
lier practice of recording fire locations by township, range,
and section may have contributed to location errors. Since
the Grand Canyon is not surveyed into townships, firefight-
ers had to estimate legal descriptions by extending township
lines from adjacent areas on maps.

difference of any study site between the all-scar and 25%-
scarred distributions, implying that most fires were relatively
large. The maximum fire-free period before European set-
tlement was 17 years for all fires, 20 years for 25%-scarred
fires. Fire seasonality was determined on 53% of the samples
(Table 6). Because narrow tree rings were the most common
reason for failure to identify the season, the determination of
seasonal distribution might be biased toward years in which
relatively good conditions for tree growth produced wider
rings. Few samples recorded dormant season fires (12%)
and none recorded latewood fires, but overall the site was
nearly evenly divided between spring fires (54%) and sum-
mer fires (46%). Temporal and spatial divisions of the fire
record prior to European settlement were not significantly
different at Grandview or any of the other study sites. Divi-

groups caused no significant difference in fire occurrence.
The MFIAll values for each group differed from the overall
MFIAll bylessthan1year(average = 0.4year),indicatingthat
the all-scar fire frequency at Grandview was not artificially
inflated due to the large sampling area.
Fires were excluded through the early 20th Century, except
for two samples scarred in 1919. The scarred trees were
located about 1.3 km apart near the HearstTanks (north end of
the study area). Beginning in 1981, prescribed burns scarred
a number of trees on the site. Correlating GCNP records
with the fire-scar dates, we identified the Hearst burn (11/81,
174 ha), another Hearst burn (8/85, 243 ha), and the B Block
burn (4/86, 61 ha). Note that the same name (e.g. ‘Hearst’)
was often used for fires in multiple years because of the prac-
tice of identifying fires by nearby features on topographic
maps [also see Pyne (1989) for a discussion of less orthodox
fire names]. Since the 1981 fire occurred in November,
dormant-season scars occurring after the 1981 latewood were
assigned the calendar year 1981.The prescribed burns did not
overlap geographically.Together they covered approximately
the northern third of the study site. The overall 20th Century
fire history for the Grandview site thus includes:
(1) A portion which has not burned in the past 110 years
(1887–1997 sample collection date);
(2) Portions which have burned once in one of three pre-
scribed fires in the 1980s; and
(3) A portion which burned in 1919 as well as in a prescribed
fire.
The fire-scar data for Grandview were also compared with
a previous fire history by Duhnkrack (1982), who used the
fire history procedure of Arno and Sneck (1977) to estimate
fire dates for nine scarred samples from the GCNP portion
of the study area. His fire dates did not coincide with the
dates we found because his samples were not cross-dated.
However, he calculated a mean fire interval of 7.3 years for
the period 1750–1900, which is within 6% of the MFI of 6.9
years in our study (Table 5).
North Rim sites
Powell Plateau.
Fire regimes on the Powell Plateau
showed the greatest variability of all the study sites between
the all-scar and 25%-scar fire interval distributions, implying
that most fires were relatively small. The WMPI for all fires
between 1720 and 1899 was the lowest of all the study sites,
3.0 years, but rose to 8.6 years for fires scarring 25% or
more of the samples (Table 5). The maximum fire-free inter-
val was 9 years for all fires, the lowest of all study sites, but
Powell had the highest maximum for 25%-scarred fires (24
years). Fire seasonality at Powell and all the North Rim sites
was strongly skewed toward later-season fires, averaging only
15–20% spring fires (Table 6).
Disruption of the Powell fire regime was complex. A rel-
atively long fire-free period of 24 years began as early as
1855 in the 25%-scarred record, but Powell burned in 1879 in
a large fire that scarred 31 of the 45 recording trees, cover-
ing the whole site. Approximately the northern two-thirds
of the site (based on the mapped locations of fire scars)
burned in 1892, with the remaining third burning in 1895.
Twenty-nine years later, in July 1924, the ‘Powell’fire crossed
much of the site, burning about 650 ha. This fire is the first
entry in the GCNP fire records. Small fires (scarring sin-
gle trees) were recorded in 1950, 1953, and 1962 (Powell2
Fire, 12/62, 23 ha). The next large fires on the Powell site
were the Zephyr (9/86, 146 ha), Muav (7/87, 324 ha), and
Dutton (7/88, 1332 ha). The latter two fires were managed
with prescribed natural fire (PNF) and confine/contain strate-
gies, respectively.The 1987 Muav fire was the first large PNF
on the Powell site.
Fire Point.
Fires recurred with a WMPI of 3.4 years (all
scars) to 6.3 years (25%-scarred) between 1733 and 1879 at
Fire Point (Table 5).After 1879, the fire regime was disrupted
for 34 years until a 1923 fire burned across approximately
the western two-thirds of the study site. None of the eight
recording samples in the eastern third of the study site was
scarred by this fire, suggesting that the eastern portion had
not burned since 1879. The ‘Fire Point’ fire of 8/31 burned
about 65 ha, also in the western portion of the site, but was
represented in the fire-scar data by only a single sample. In
July 1989, the 708-ha Muav fire scarred trees on Fire Point
but was contained to the south-western corner of the study
site. After sampling for the present study was completed, the
entire site was burned in the Boundary fire (9/99, 156 ha).
Rainbow Plateau.
The WMPI was 3.9 years (all scars)
and 7.5 years (25%-scarred) between 1715 and 1879 on the
Rainbow Plateau site. Maximal fire-free intervals prior to
European settlement ranged from 11 years (all scars) to 18

North Rim regional fire interval analysis comparing pre-disruption fire years over multiple study sites
The analysis includes fire years represented within sites by the all-scars and 25% scarred categories. Within these
categories, fire years are analysed between sites in three groups: (1) all fire years; (2) fire years represented on 50% or
more of the sites; and (3) fire years represented on 75% or more of the sites. Fires after 1879 never occurred on more
than one study site per fire year, so only the ‘all fire year’ category is reported. Swamp Ridge had no fires after 1879,
except for a single scarred tree in 1954, so it was not included in the 1880–1997 analysis

years (25%-scarred). Only 21 years after 1879, a fire in 1900
burned over the entire study site. Smaller fires confined to the
southern tip of the plateau burned in 1908, 1938, 1944, 1948
(Rainbow Plateau fire, 10/48, 7 ha), and 1970 (Rainbow fire,
5/70, 19 ha). The entire study site was burned in the Rainbow
fire (10/85, 526 ha), which was suppressed, and again in the
Emerald prescribed natural fire (8/93, 138 ha).
Swamp Ridge.
WMPI values ranged from 5.1 years (all
scars) to 8.7 years (25%-scarred) between 1721 and 1879
(Table 5). Maximum fire-free intervals were also relatively
long, 15–21 years for the all-scar and 25%-scarred distribu-
tions, respectively. The Swamp Ridge site has undergone the
longest fire exclusion period of any of the study sites, with no
fires recorded after 1879, except for a fire scarring a single
sample tree in 1954.
Gradient analysis of fire regimes
Fire frequency and variability prior to European settle-
ment declined over the geographic and elevational gradient
from Powell Plateau to Swamp Ridge, a region encom-
passing approximately 96 km2. Fire intervals increased by
150–200% (depending on the site and proportional scar-
ring category). The westernmost site, Powell Plateau, had the
greatest difference in frequency of large vs. small fires, with
the WMPI25% nearly 300% greater than the WMPIAll. The
difference dropped to 180–195% at Fire Point and Rainbow
Plateau, respectively, and was only 150% at Swamp Ridge
(Table 5). On the North Rim, average site elevation was
correlated with WMPIAll (r = 0.94) and the ratio of large
to small fires (WMPI25%:WMPIAll, r = −0.63), but n = 4.
The pattern did not extend to the South Rim: the highest
WMPI25% and WMPIAll values were recorded at Grand-
view, the lowest-elevation study area. In general, geographic
position was related to fire frequency: island most frequent
→point/peninsula →mainland least frequent. But when
fires occurred, mainland sites were as much as twice as
likely to have large fires, as indicated by the lower ratios
of WMPI25%:WMPIAll in Table 5.
Before 1879, a fire burned in at least one of the North Rim
study sites nearly every 2 years (Table 7). In the ‘all scar’
category, fires burned in two of the four sites with a WMPI
of 3.1 years and in three or more sites with a WMPI of 6.3
years. Restricting the analysis to years in which 25% or more
of the samples were scarred—that is, years in which most
sites burned with large fires—intervals were approximately
twice as long (3.2–13.7 years).
The climate–fire relationship differed over the gradient
of study sites (Fig. 4). At all sites, fires tended to occur in
dry years following wet years. But the fire years at Grand-
view, the lowest elevation site, were not significantly dry. At
the highest-elevation site, however, the fire years were sig-
nificantly drier than the 99th percentile of the bootstrapped
sample. A ‘dryness’index for each site was estimated by tak-
ing the ratio of the mean tree-ring width index during fire
years to the bootstrapped—99th percentile tree-ring width
index. Elevation was highly correlated with ‘dryness’, with
r = 0.97 for a declining polynomial relationship.
Major fire years, defined as those in which at least three
of the four North Rim study sites burned, are listed in
Table 8. Twelve of the 20 major fire years were relatively dry,
consistent with the SEA results. The driest year in the 1721–
1879 period, 1847, was not a major fire year, but three out of
the four sites burned in the second-driest year, 1822. None

Superposed epoch analysis (SEA) showing the relationship
between local climate (tree-ring width index) and fire occurrence. Sites
are listed from lowest elevation (Grandview) to highest (Swamp Ridge).
The average climate value is scaled to 1. Bootstrapping procedures were
used to assess the statistical significance of climate departures above the
mean (‘wet years’) and below the mean (‘dry years’) in the fire years
(year 0), the 5 years preceding fires (−5 through −1), and the 2 years
after fires (1 and 2). The three lines above and below the x-axis in each
graph represent confidence intervals of 90%, 95%, and 99%.
of the major fire years coincided with reconstructed positive
or negative extreme years of the Southern Oscillation Index
(Stahle and Cleaveland 1993). Fires occurred on the Grand-
view site on only 20% (4 out of 20) of the North Rim’s major
fire years.
After 1879, fire regimes were disrupted at all the North
Rim study sites (with the exception of Powell Plateau, Fig. 3).
No further fires occurred at the Swamp Ridge site except the
single-scarring fire in 1954. Fire-free intervals for the other
three sites between 1879 and 1997 were longer than intervals
prior to European settlement (Table 7) and no two sites have
had fires in the same year since 1879 (Fig. 3).
Discussion
Validity of fire-scar sampling and analysis
The reliability of fire-scar analysis as a means for recon-
structing fire patterns has been an important question for
decades (Stokes and Dieterich 1980; Agee 1993; Baker and
Ehle 2001). Fire-scar methods are inherently limited because
not every fire scars trees, even those with open ‘recording’
scars (Dieterich and Swetnam 1984), fire-scarred trees are
not uniformly distributed across the landscape, and indi-
vidual scarred trees differ greatly in the number of fires
and temporal period recorded. Johnson and Gutsell (1994:
268) criticized the ‘informal’ sampling of fire scars, argu-
ing that random (or stratified) sampling was necessary to
develop valid quantitative estimates of fire frequency. In a
detailed treatment of all south-western fire-scar studies to
date,SwetnamandBaisan(1996,2003)reviewedtheassump-
tions, limitations, and statistical approaches, focusing on the
mechanisms through which the landscape-scale process of
fire is recorded in point locations. The central argument was
that the object of study was the fire events, not the trees that
record fires, suggesting that random tree sampling was not
helpful. Instead, assuming that study areas were well-chosen
(relatively homogeneous, without barriers to fire spread, etc.),
sampling of well-distributed trees with multiple scars would
provide the most complete and extensive fire record.
Fall (1998) identified three sources of uncertainty in fire-
scar studies:
(1) A fire may fail to leave a record (scar) in every burned
location;
(2) A severe fire may erase previous records; or
(3) Sampling may not detect all past fires, even if a record
exists.
The first source is an inherent limitation (Dieterich and
Swetnam 1984). The second source of uncertainty, severe
fire, appears not to have occurred in the temporal period
of this study. Sites were homogeneous in vegetation type,
no large patches (>1–2 ha) that may have been fire-caused
were detected, fuel accumulation would have been limited by

frequent surface fires, old trees were found at most points
on 300 × 300 m grids, and all sites were highly uneven-aged
(Table 3, complete age structure in Fulé et al. 2002). How-
ever, small patches of severe burning or other disturbance
causing mortality cannot be excluded.
Incomplete detection, the third source of uncertainty, can-
not be verified without complete sampling of all fire-scar
evidence, presumably including buried scars in intact trees
(McClaran 1988).A scar census to test the detection threshold
would be a useful contribution but such sampling would have
been beyond the scope, authorization, and ethical constraints
of this study, requiring cutting into large numbers of old-
growth trees in a national park. However, the cumulative
sample curves (Fig. 2) indicated that the samples collected
captured most of the fire years, i.e. that continued sam-
pling would have contributed very few additional fire dates.
Furthermore, the facts that the 10% of best recorders cap-
tured 54–80% of fire dates and that the first 50% of random
recorders captured 72–94% of fire dates support Swetnam
and Baisan’s (1996) contention that fire history information
should be sought specifically in the best recorders, not in ran-
dom scarred trees. Since the sample set as a whole contains
the best recorders from each study site, adding more poor-
recording samples would have produced diminishing returns
even below the level suggested by the cumulative sample
curves. The hypothesis that old trees with open, unhealed
fire scars would be poor recorders of recent fires because of
thickening bark was not supported by evidence of high fire
recording rates across multi-decadal to century-long fire-free
gaps.
In their critical review of fire-scar analysis, Baker and Ehle
(2001) argued that the uncertainty associated with sampling
problems and extrapolation between scarred points was so
large that mean fire interval statistics should be bracketed
as much as 1100–1200%. This concept was not supported
in the present study. The acid test of fire-scar validity was
the detection of all 13 historical fires >8 ha. There was no
evidence of overestimation of fire occurrence (Minnich et al.
2000), as long as the proportional filtering of fire size is taken
into account so that all-scar fire statistics are considered sep-
arately from statistics for larger fires, as done here. Thus for
75 years (1924–1999) over 1755 ha, we correctly identified
fires down to an 8-ha patch size. Unless one assumes that
the mechanisms of fire-tree interaction were different prior
to 1924, there is no need to ‘bracket’the fire history statistics,
other than explicitly to make two points:
(1) Some additional small fires were probably missed; and
(2) Virtually all fires, including those prior to 1880 as well as
at present, burn with a mosaic of intensities and include
unburned areas within the overall fire perimeter.
In sum, within the understood limitations of the physical
evidence, sampling capability, and burning variability, the
methodology of this study appears to be a consistent and

142

accurate approach to detailed reconstruction of approxi-
mately 300 years of fire disturbance at these study sites.
The reliability of fire-scar analysis has broad implications
for management because plans for restoration of ponderosa
pine and forests with similar fire ecology characteristics
are predicated on the view that frequent, low-intensity fires
and low-density forests were natural and desirable features
(Covington 2000; McIver et al. 2001; USDA/USDI 2002).
If Baker and Ehle’s (2001) alternative interpretation of the
same data were correct, with fire intervals as much as 10
times greater, managers would need to re-evaluate the ecolog-
ical underpinning of forest restoration. Presumably plans for
tree thinning and prescribed burning would be scaled back,
while high-intensity fire might be more widely considered
acceptable. There are both ecological and social reasons why
a range of forest conditions may be suitable in specific times
and places to meet management goals (e.g. Shinneman and
Baker 1997; Brown et al. 1999; Tiedemann et al. 2000). But
the high precision of the Grand Canyon data in this study
indicates that the range of uncertainty perceived by Baker
and Ehle (2001) was excessive. Management decisions at
Grand Canyon and similar south-western forests should con-
tinue to rest on the regional range of historical variability
in fire regimes, such as the data summarized by Swetnam
and Baisan (1996), as a point of reference for evaluating
ecological change and selecting restoration alternatives.
Fire regimes over the environmental gradient
Geographical location (island →point/peninsula →main-
land) was weakly associated with fire frequency prior to
European settlement (all fires) and the ratio between small
and large fires at the Grand Canyon study area. Considering
only the North Rim sites, fire frequency (all fires) declined
moderately with increasing elevation and fires occurred in
relatively drier years at higher elevations, consistent with
the general trends throughout the Southwest (Swetnam and
Betancourt 1990, 1998; Swetnam and Baisan 1996; Touchan
et al. 1996; Brown et al. 2001). Using the 25%-scarred filter
instead of all fires, however, mean fire intervals at Grandview,
Powell Plateau, and Swamp Ridge were all within 0.5 year
(range 9.0–9.5 years), with lower values only at Fire Point
(6.4 years) and Rainbow Plateau (7.8 years). The inconsis-
tency in the relationship between geographical location and
fire frequency suggests that the biogeographical gradient is
not a strong influence on fire occurrence and that apparent
trends may depend on the choice of filter (e.g. all-scarred
versus 25%-scarred).
A possible explanation for the high fire incidence on
the western North Rim is that the topographically promi-
nent points and plateaus are well-placed to receive lightning
strikes, similar to the islands studied by Bergeron (1991),
although the likelihood of ignition depends not only on
lightning occurrence but also fuel conditions (continuity,
moisture) (van Wagtendonk 1991). The historical lightning
fire density of the western North Rim is high, reaching
2.7 fires/km2 in the 1955–1980 period at the south end of
Rainbow Plateau (unpublished fire density map, on file at
Fire Management Office, GCNP). However, the data from
the Grandview study site contradict the North Rim pattern.
The fire regime prior to European settlement at the
Grandview area presented a distinct contrast to the North
Rim pattern. Grandview was at the lowest elevation of
all the study areas, having environmental characteristics
most similar to Powell Plateau, but had the lowest fire fre-
quency and the lowest ratio (1.37) between large and small
fires, thereby displaying fire regime characteristics most
similar to the high-elevation Swamp Ridge study area. The
reasons for the differences are not clear. The South Rim may
appear to be less well-placed for lightning than the promi-
nent North Rim features, but historical records show that the
highest lightning fire density in the park, 4.2 fires/km2, is
on the South Rim (top of Long Jim Canyon) and the light-
ning fire density across the Grandview study area is similar to
that of Powell Plateau, up to 2.3 fires/km2 in the 1955–1980
period (unpublished fire density map, on file at Fire Man-
agement Office, GCNP). We can speculate that the historical
record might be more accurate for small lightning fires at
Grandview, such as fires burning single snags before being
extinguished by rain, because detection would be more likely
on the populous South Rim than on the remote western North
Rim. The Grandview study area is located immediately north
of a lookout tower, facilitating detection of small fires. Other
possible explanations might be differences in topography or
fuels, but average slopes were identical at Powell Plateau and
Grandview (Table 1) and vegetation communities and fuel
loads are similar (Fulé et al. 2002).
Native Americans may have influenced fire regimes at
all of the sites. There is extensive archeological evidence of
people residing and farming at all of the study areas except
Swamp Ridge until A.D. 1300. Many tribes used natural
resources in the region up through early European settlement
(Altschul and Fairley 1989).The historical record of lightning
fires—dozens to over 100 ignitions per year—suggests that
lightning alone may always have been sufficient to maintain
frequent fire regimes.The occurrence of fires outside the typ-
ical fire season has been used to infer human-caused ignition
(e.g. Baisan and Swetnam 1997; Kaye and Swetnam 1999);
no pattern of unusual seasonal burning was observed in the
present study. Human-caused fires have probably always been
a factor in Grand Canyon ecosystems, but the extent and
ecological importance of native burning remains uncertain.
Fire sizes prior to European settlement reached at least
hundreds of hectares, for fires scarring 25% or more of the
samples distributed across the study areas, and probably
reached many thousands to tens of thousands of hectares.The
810-ha Grandview site is surrounded on the west, south, and
east by contiguous ponderosa pine forest, providing oppor-
tunities for regional fires to spread across much larger areas.

Grand Canyon fire regimes
143
The major North Rim fire years (Table 8) provide evidence
of widespread fire in many years. The four North Rim study
areas span an area of 96 km2, of which 59% or 57 km2 is
forest (the remainder is below-rim vegetation). In years such
as 1873 and 1879 it is likely that fire burned over most of
this area. Since the typical wind direction in the fire season is
from the south-west, fire sizes in such years may have grown
much larger than the area covered by the east–west transect
of our study areas. Multiple ignitions of fires in the same
year or season are also likely. In the historical record, the
maximum number of lightning fires, 125, occurred in 1988.
Seventy-one lightning fires started that June with a record of
31 lightning starts on one day (17 June 1988). The second-
closest month was July of 1970, with 41 lightning fires. In the
absence of suppression activities, the role of multiple igni-
tions may have been moot in areas where fires could burn
together. However, multiple ignitions were evidently impor-
tant where fire spread was otherwise impossible, such as the
1748 fires on both North and South Rim sites.
Fire regime disruption and restoration
How big of a change in the natural fire regime consti-
tutes a ‘disruption’ of this disturbance process? The absolute
values of fire-free periods are probably less ecologically sig-
nificant than the relative length of such periods compared
with natural variability (Stephenson 1999). The modern fire-
free periods at Swamp Ridge and Grandview are about 5.5
times longer than the maximum interval prior to European
settlement for large (25%-scarred) fires. Across much of
western NorthAmerica, changes of this magnitude have been
associated with increased living and dead fuels reaching a
threshold beyond which fires become large-scale crown fires
(Covington et al. 1994). In the absence of adaptations to per-
mit regeneration or mechanisms to retain soil and propagules
after large disturbances, forest conditions may be indefinitely
altered (Romme et al. 1998).
Although fire frequency at the three non-mainland sites
was clearly reduced after 1879, each experienced either two
or three large surface fires since European settlement. These
relatively uninterrupted fire regimes are highly unusual in
the Southwest (Swetnam and Baisan 1996), even in com-
parison with the other large unharvested forest area, the Gila
WildernessinNewMexico(SwetnamandDieterich1985;but
also see Rollins et al. 2000). Taking all three western North
Rim sites together, regional fire intervals appear to have only
approximately doubled since 1879 (Table 7), seeming to fall
well within the pre-disruption maximum fire-free intervals
(Table 5). However, such a comparison would obscure key
differences between the pre-1879 and post-1879 fire regimes.
Most importantly, since 1879 no fire has occurred at more
than one study site per year.
Understanding the disturbance patterns that influenced
an ecosystem is a critical first step for management. The
next issue is how to apply the information. Even if perfect
knowledge of past fire regimes were available, future actions
must consider today’s unique situation. Prior to 1880, Grand
Canyonforestswerecharacterizedbylargefiresizes,highfire
frequency even on geographically isolated sites, and strong
connection between extensive fires and dry years, implying
that huge regions burned during droughts and that burned
area and smoke production varied widely between years. In
contrast, most modern management fires are either ignited
or allowed to burn under ‘safer’ conditions, usually at much
smaller sizes. Managers are unlikely to try to imitate the pre-
1880 fire regime, but a thoughtful quantitative comparison
of the past and present fire regimes could support adaptive
testing of alternatives. There are several challenges.
First, smoke and the threat of escaped fire are major con-
straints, especially because the park boundaries are arbitrary
east–west lines across the Kaibab and Coconino Plateaus.
Second, the change in forest composition since fire exclu-
sion has been exactly opposite to the predicted direction of
climate change: mesic species expanded to lower elevations.
In contrast, future conditions are expected to be warmer and
drier, more conducive to longer fire seasons and increasing
total fire activity (Flannigan et al. 2000), reduction in range
of temperate forest species like ponderosa pine and Douglas-
fir (Shafer et al. 2001), and the likelihood that climate change
will interact with fire and other disturbances in novel and pos-
sibly severe ways (Flanningan et al. 2000; Dale et al. 2001).
The remote North Rim sites may present a valuable exam-
ple. Although fire frequency on the north-western points and
plateaus prior to European settlement was much higher than
the post-1879 fire occurrence, these sites may still be the
best existing representatives of natural ponderosa pine forest
landscapes in the Southwest. It would be useful to test the
hypothesis that a few widely spaced fires can have ecological
effects reasonably similar to those of the natural fire regime.
If so, managers might be able to foster safe, low-smoke, and
cost-efficient modern fire regimes by using wildland fire at
longer intervals.
