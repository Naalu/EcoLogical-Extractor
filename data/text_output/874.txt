Abstract
Scattering slash (downed woody materials) after tree removal is increasingly prescribed by land managers as a treatment to
promote the establishment and growth of understory vegetation in pinyon–juniper woodlands. However, the effects of
scattering slash on soil resources and plant communities are poorly understood and often confounded with the release from tree
competition. In order to examine how slash affects plant establishment, soil stability, soil nutrients, and soil microbiota, we
initiated a 2 3 2 full factorial experiment with two levels of seeding and two levels of slash additions within 30 intercanopy
spaces, repeated at two intact pinyon–juniper woodland sites with different soil characteristics in northwestern Arizona.
Pretreatment data were collected in 2003 and posttreatment responses were measured in 2004 and 2005. Total plant cover
increased within all treatments; however, grasses increased significantly only in the seed-and-slash treatment at both sites. In
addition, a greater proportion of seed-and-slash plots contained more reproductively active grasses compared to seed-only plots.
Slash treatments also resulted in significantly less sediment movement compared to nonslash treatments. Changes in soil
nutrients were not observed, except available NO3-N decreased significantly in slash treatments. Arbuscular mycorrhizal
potential and microbial biomass carbon increased as a result of the slash treatment. Addition of woody materials appeared to
have general effectiveness at improving the ecological function of soils and promoting understory establishment and thus may be
considered a desirable treatment for improving degraded conditions.
Resumen
La dispersio´n de la tala (materiales len˜osos derribados) despue´s de la remocio´n del a´rbol es prescrita cada vez ma´s por los
administradores de tierras como un tratamiento para promover el crecimiento y el establecimiento de la vegetacio´n del
sotobosque en los bosques de pino pin˜onero y enebro. Sin embargo, los efectos de la dispersio´n de la tala en las comunidades de
plantas y en los recursos del suelo son pobremente comprendidos y a menudo confundidos con la liberacio´n de la competencia
arbustiva. En orden para examinar como la tala afecta el establecimiento de la planta, la estabilidad del suelo, los nutrientes del
suelo y la micro biota del suelo, nosotros iniciamos un experimento factorial completo 2 3 2 con dos niveles de siembra y dos
niveles de adiccio´n de tala en 30 espacios dentro del dosel, repitie´ndolo en dos sitios intactos de bosque de pino pin˜onero y
enebro de diferentes caracterı´sticas de suelo en el noroeste de Arizona. Los datos previos al tratamiento fueron colectados en el
2003 y las respuestas posteriores al tratamiento fueron medidas en el 2004 y 2005. La cobertura vegetal total aumento´ en todos
los tratamientos, sin embargo las hierbas aumentaron significativamente so´lo en el tratamiento de semilla y tala en ambos sitios.
Adema´s, una mayor porcio´n de parcelas semillas y tala contuvieron ma´s hierbas reproductivamente activas comparadas a las
parcelas de solo semilla. Los tratamientos de tala tambie´n resultaron significativamente en menos movimiento de sedimento
comparado a los tratamientos de no tala. No se observaron cambios en los nutrientes del suelo, excepto el N03-N disponible que
disminuyo´ significativamente en los tratamientos de tala. El potencial micorrı´zico arbuscular y el carbono en la biomasa
microbiana se incrementaron como resultado al tratamiento de tala. La adiccio´n de los materiales len˜osos parece tener una
efectividad general en mejorar la funcio´n ecolo´gica de los suelos y en promover el establecimiento del sotobosque, y de este
modo se podrı´a considerar como un tratamiento conveniente para mejorar las condiciones degradadas.

INTRODUCTION
The in-filling of trees into adjacent intercanopy openings over
the past century has raised concerns for conserving the
ecological integrity of many pinyon–juniper woodlands (Cot-
tam and Stewart 1940; Tausch et al. 1981; Harris et al. 2003;
Weisberg et al. 2007). The heterogonous structure often
associated with intact pinyon–juniper woodlands is developing
into a continuous canopy structure with high fuel loads (West
1984; Evans 1988; Tausch 1999; Romme et al. 2003). Close
temporal association between intense grazing pressures and tree
expansion, both beginning in the late 1800s, suggest livestock
grazing may have facilitated the depletion of herbaceous
biomass within portions of northern Arizona (Altschul and
Fairly 1989). As a result, understory patches are being
displaced by tree species, which is altering ecosystem processes
Research was funded in part by the Bureau of Land Management, the Ecological Restoration
Institute, and the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service.

and leading to degraded ecological conditions (Schlesinger et al.
1990; Callaway 1995; Tausch and West 1995). Undesirable
conditions are typically indicated by sparse ground cover,
erosion of topsoils, loss of native understory abundance and
species richness, depletion of soil seedbanks, disruption in
hydrological processes, and altered disturbance regimes (Wood
et al. 1987; Pieper 1990; Poulsen et al. 1999; Miller and Tausch
2001; Wilcox et al. 2003). However, with such an extensive
range and variety of habitats, the condition of pinyon–juniper
woodlands spans from relatively pristine to heavily degraded
(Miller et al. 1999; Romme et al. 2003). Specific examples
described as relatively
intact pristine woodlands include
portions of Mesa Verde in southwestern Colorado and isolated
mesas in northern Arizona and southern Utah, all of which
consist of a mosaic structure with distinct groups of all-aged
trees, separated by open intercanopy patches with an assort-
ment of native understory species and little soil erosion
(Jameson et al. 1962; Schmutz et al. 1967; Thatcher and Hart
1974; Floyd et al. 2000).
Plant community recovery is possible if sufficient native
understory pools exist, both above ground and in the soil
seedbank. In degraded pinyon–juniper woodlands, soil seed-
banks are depleted, and understory plant recruitment is limited
(Koniak and Everett 1982; Call and Roundy 1991; Poulsen et
al. 1999). The recovery of understory populations could be
accelerated with the application of seeds, although seeding can
be expensive and have unpredictable effectiveness (Poulsen et
al. 1999; Chambers 2000).
Scattering slash that is generated when trees are thinned or
pruned has been found to improve the ecological function of
soils and accelerate the establishment of herbaceous commu-
nities in semiarid woodlands (Tongway and Ludwig 1996;
Breshears et al. 1998; Jacobs and Gatewood 1999; Wood and
Javed 2001; Hastings and Javed 2001; Hastings et al. 2003).
Unfortunately, understory responses to slash additions are
frequently confounded with reduced overstory competition
that results from tree thinning. Scattered slash is likely to
promote plant establishment and growth by ameliorating
harsh
microclimates,
increasing
soil
moisture,
impeding
erosion of topsoil, and trapping windblown seeds and organic
debris (Herman et al. 1995; Tongway and Ludwig 1996;
Jacobs and Gatewood 1999; Brockway et al. 2002; Hastings et
al. 2003). However, accumulation of needles may negatively
effect germination by reducing soil–seed contact and through
the release of chemical inhibitors (Jameson 1970; Chambers
2000; Horman and Anderson 2003). Inputs of organic matter
can also stimulate increases in microbial populations, thus
enhancing soil structure and soil–plant interactions (Ludwig
and Reynolds 1988; Schlesinger et al. 1990; Herman et al.
1995), but may also contribute to the immobilization of soil
nutrients, which may inhibit plant growth (Murty et al. 1996).
Furthermore, soil characteristics can also affect herbaceous
communities by trapping and retaining seeds and influencing
soil water potential and nutrient dynamics (Harper et al. 1965,
Chambers 2000). It is therefore important to understand site
characteristics as well as ameliorations such as slash treat-
ments’ influences on understory responses. Nonetheless, there
is insufficient evidence documenting impacts of residual
woody materials on improving soil conditions and improving
native
plant
communities
and
often
these
results
are
confounded with other treatments, thus reducing the general-
izations of these results.
The specific objectives of our study were to 1) evaluate the
effects of slash additions on soil movement, 2) quantify the
effects of slash addition on soil chemistry and soil biota, and 3)
assess the effectiveness of slash additions on native grass
emergence and establishment. Grasses are of particular interest
because root biomass associated with grasses is likely to help in
soil stabilization (West 1999). We hypothesized that slash
additions would decrease soil movement and increase nutrient
availability and mycorrhizal and soil microbial potential, which
would improve soil conditions and support the establishment of
native perennial graminoids within intercanopy openings.
METHODS
Study Area
Our study was conducted 2003–2005 at Grand Canyon–
Parashant National Monument near Mount Trumbull in north-
west Arizona. In 2004, we established identical experiments at
two sites, each representing characteristic soil types in pinyon–
juniper woodlands of this region. The first site we refer to as the
‘‘clay-loam’’ site (lat 36u269N, long 113u099W) where soils were
fine, smectitic, mesic aridic Argiustolls (DeWall 1993). Major
management factors for the clay-loam site included slow water
permeability, high shrink–swell soils, and high available water
capacity (DeWall 1993). At the second site, which we refer to as
the ‘‘cinder’’ site (lat 36u249N, long 113u129W), soils had ashy-
skeletal surface texture over fragmental or cindery, mixed, mesic
vitrandic Haplustepts. Major management factors for this site
included moderate to high water permeability, and very low
available water capacity (DeWall 1993). Elevation of both sites
ranges from approximately 1 900 m to 1 950 m.
Climate data, compiled from the Nixon Flats Remote
Automated Weather Station site at Mount Trumbull, Arizona
(1 980 m), indicated that mean annual precipitation for the last
decade (1992–2005) was 429 mm. Total annual precipitation
during the field experiment in 2004 and 2005 was 448 mm and
919 mm, respectively. Precipitation patterns for the region
follow a bimodal distribution with monsoonal rains in July
through September and snowfall in the winter months.
Precipitation during the summer monsoon falls primarily
during short-duration, high-intensity storms, which can result
in relatively severe soil erosion.
Vegetation at the sites is classified as Great Basin Cold
Temperate Woodland (Brown 1994). Mixed-aged stands of
pinyon pine (Pinus edulis Engelm.) and Utah juniper (Juniperus
osteosperma Torr.) dominated the two sites and ranged in density
from 638 trees ? ha21 to 832 trees ? ha21 (D. W. Huffman, M. T.
Stoddard, P. Z. Fule´, W. W. Covington, and H. B. Smith,
unpublished data, 2005). Tree densities are presently four times
greater than estimated in 1870 (D. W. Huffman, M. T. Stoddard,
P. Z. Fule´, W. W. Covington, and H. B. Smith, unpublished data,
2005) and understory conditions are in poor condition. Historical
evidenceindicatesintenselivestockgrazingatthesitescommenced
around 1870 and continued until the 1980s (Altschul and Fairly
1989). A range inspection report from 1969 stated that all three
allotments in the area were in very poor condition and utilization
of grasses was around 100% each season (Bureau of Land
486
Rangeland Ecology & Management

Management District Office, St George, UT, unpublished report,
1969). Soil seedbanks were relatively depleted with less than 200
seeds ? m22 (D. W. Huffman, M. T. Stoddard, P. Z. Fule´, W. W.
Covington, and H. B. Smith, unpublished data, 2005). Active soil
erosion was clearly evident throughout both sites. Common
understory species at the sites included purple bird’s peak
(Cordylanthus pariviflorus [Ferris] Wiggins), sulphur-flower
buckwheat (Eriogonum umbellatum Torr.), slimflower scurfpea
(Psoralidium tenuiflorum [Pursh] Rydb.), and fineleaf hymeno-
pappus (Hymenopappus filifolius Hook.).
Experimental Design
At each site, a full factorial design with two levels of seeding
(no seed, seed) and two levels of slash materials (no slash, slash)
was added in canopy openings (interspaces) that ranged in size
from 0.02 ha to 0.05 ha. Fifteen interspaces were randomly
selected at each of the two study sites. Four 1 3 1 m permanent
plots were randomly established in each interspace. Plots were
placed at least 2 m apart and at least 3 m from the edge of any
tree crown. We randomly assigned one of the following
treatments to each plot: 1) control, 2) seed, 3) slash, or 4)
seed + slash. Treatments were applied in early August 2003 to
coincide with monsoonal rains.
Seeding mixture comprised equal weights of the following
four native grasses: 1) Indian ricegrass (Achnatherum hyme-
noides [Roemer and J. A. Schultes] Barkworth); 2) purple
threeawn (Artistida purpurea Nutt.); 3) bottlebrush squirreltail
(Elymus elymoides [Raf.] Swezey subsp. elymoides); and 4)
sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula [Michx.] Torr.). These
species were selected to represent a seed mix land managers
may use for pinyon–juniper restoration. All selected species
were observed near or within the study sites. Seeds were
thoroughly mixed and hand broadcast at a rate of 9.7 g ? m22.
For slash treatments, slash materials were collected by pruning
juniper trees located at least 50 m away from the interspaces.
Pruned material was less than 7.6 cm in diameter and less than
1 m in length. Slash amounting to 9.0 kg ? m22 fresh weight
was placed on plots after seeding was completed. This amount
of slash created beds of approximately 0.6 m in depth.
Field Methods
Foliar cover of each species and soil substrate on each plot was
ocularly estimated during the month of August in 2003
(pretreatment), 2004 (posttreatment), and 2005 (posttreatment).
We also counted plant individuals on plots during each sampling
period. In 2005, individual grass plants were examined for the
presence of inflorescences. Plant nomenclature followed the US
Department of Agriculture Plants Database (US Department of
Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service 2004).
Soil movement was estimated using erosion bridge measure-
ments (Shakesby 1993; Brockway et al. 2002). Prior to
treatments, two permanent stakes were placed 1 m apart along
the downhill edge of each plot. Stakes were driven into the soil
and then cemented with approximately 5 cm extending above the
ground. An angle iron (bridge) was placed on top of the stakes at
each plot and the height from the bridge to the soil surface was
measured at three fixed points using a 15-cm square with a built-
in level. We averaged the three measurements in order to estimate
bridge height and subsequent gain or loss of soil.
We collected three soil samples from random locations
within each plot in August 2003 and 2004. Soils were collected
to a depth of 10 cm using a soil core 4.2 cm in diameter. All
soil samples were collected in August each year in order to
control for season variation in soil properties. Soil samples
from each plot were composited and subsamples of the
composites were analyzed for arbuscular mycorrhizae potential
(AMP) and soil chemistry. Additional samples were also
collected from control and slash plots in August 2004 to
determine microbial biomass carbon (C).
Soil Analysis
Soil Biota. To test for AMP, sampled soil was placed into 4 3
20 cm Conetainers (Stuewe and Sons, Inc., Corvallis, OR) within
24 h of field collection and used for bait-plant bioassays
(Brundrett and Abbott 1994). Corn (Zea mays L.) seeds were
germinated and then placed in the Conetainers as bait plants for
mycorrhizal fungi. We used corn as the host plant, because it is
mycotrophic with a variety of fungal species and its growth is
relatively fast and uniform in a range of soil types (Johnson et al.
1999). Corn plants were harvested after 5 wk. Roots of these
plants were cut into 2.5-cm segments and a random subsample of
these segments was cleared using a potassium hydroxide solution
and then stained in 0.5% Shaeffer ink (Vierheilin et al. 1998).
Stained root segments were examined under a dissecting
microscope and AMP colonization was quantified for each
segment using the gridline-intersect method (Johnson et al.
1999). This method detects a range of inoculum sources and is
considered a more reliable method for quantifying total density of
AMP propagules than direct counts of spores or colonized root
lengths (Brundrett and Abbott 1994; Johnson et al. 1999).
Soil microbial C was determined using the chloroform
fumigation–extraction method (Brooks et al. 1985; Grady
and Hart 2006). Organic C concentrations in unfumigated and
fumigated extracts were determined by ultraviolet-enhanced
persulfate oxidation using a Dohrmann DC-80 carbon analyzer
with infrared detection (Tekmar-Dohrmann, Cincinnati, OH).
Microbial C was calculated by subtracting organic C in the
unfumigated extracts from organic C in the fumigated extracts
and dividing by 0.39 (Grady and Hart 2006).
Soil Chemistry. Composite soil samples from each plot were
analyzed for pH, total nitrogen (N), organic C, and available
NO3-N (nitrate) and NH4-N (ammonium). Soil pH was
determined in 1:1 soil:water slurry using a pH meter. Air-dried
soils were grounded with a mortar and pestle and then analyzed
for total N and organic C concentrations using a FLASH EA
1112 Elemental Analyzer (CE Elantech Inc., Lakewood, NJ).
Available NO3-N and NH4-N was determined by potassium
chloride extraction of freshly collected soil by automated
colorimetry using a Technicon Autoanalyzer (Parkinson and
Allen 1975). NO3-N and NH4-N analyses were only conducted
on 2004 posttreatment soil samples.
Statistical Analyses
Vegetation. Treatment effects on vegetation and substrate
cover were analyzed using Kruskal–Wallis nonparametric tests.
Following statistically significant results (P , 0.05), Mann–

Whitney tests were used to make pairwise treatment compar-
isons. Alpha levels for pairwise tests were adjusted using a
Bonferonni correction (Kuehl 1994). Proportions of reproduc-
tively active grasses were compared between slash and nonslash
plots with x2 tests. We also used linear regression to examine
the relationship between soil movement (absolute value) and
total cover from nonslash plots. Prior to analysis, total
percentage of cover data were log (n + 1) transformed to meet
the normality assumption.
Soils Biota and Chemistry. Effects of treatment and time on
soil movement were analyzed using multivariate analysis of
variance for repeated measures tests. One-way analysis of
variance was used to test treatment effects on AMP and soil
chemistry
variables.
Paired
t
tests
were
used
to
assess
differences between control and slash-only treatment means
for microbial biomass carbon. We used the Shapiro–Wilks test
to evaluate normality and Levene’s test to assess homoscedas-
ticity of variance. Prior to analysis, NO3-N data and AMP data
were square-root transformed to meet the normality assump-
tion. If a significant result occurred, we used Tukey’s honestly
significant difference test to compare treatment differences
within years All tests were conducted at alpha 5 0.05 using
JMP-IN software (version 5.1.2; SAS 2004).
RESULTS
Vegetation Response
Prior to treatment, no distinguishable differences were recorded
in total understory cover among treatments at either site.
Average understory cover was less than 2% at the clay-loam
site and 0.5% at the cinder site (Table 1). Grass cover
comprised less than 0.1% at both sites (Table 1).
In 2004, treatment differences for understory functional
groups were limited to grasses, exotics, and perennial forbs at
the clay-loam site (Table 1; Fig. 1). Grass foliar cover and
density (number of individuals ? m22) was significantly higher
(P , 0.0001 and P , 0.0001, respectively) in the seed-and-slash
treatment compared to the other three treatments (Fig. 1).
Grass cover represented 43% of the total cover (2.1%) in the
seed-and-slash treatment, 8% in the seed-only treatment, and
2% in the control plots. However, overall grass cover and
density on the site remained very low at , 1% and , 8
indiviuals ? m22, respectively. Exotic species cover was signif-
icantly
higher
(P 5 0.006)
in
the
control
and
seed-only
treatments. This difference was driven by increases in little
hogweed (Portula oleraces L.), a shade-intolerant annual.
In 2005, total vegetation cover increased by at least 300% in
all of the treatments when compared to the previous year;
however, treatment differences were restricted to grasses and
exotics functional groups at the clay-loam site (Table 1). Grass
foliar cover and density was once again higher (P , 0.0001 and
P , 0.0001,
respectively)
in
the
seed-and-slash
treatment
compared to the other three treatments (Fig. 1). Exotic cover
continued to be significantly (P 5 0.007) higher in both
nonslash treatments; however, all treatments showed slight
decreases in exotic cover when compared to the previous year.
Total understory cover at the cinder site increased across all
treatments in both posttreatment sampling years (Table 1).

Rangeland Ecology & Management

Significant treatment effects were apparent in total cover with
the greatest increases resulting in the seed-and-slash treatment
in both 2004 and 2005 (P 5 0.002 and P 5 0.04, respectively).
Treatment effects on grass cover and density at the cinder site
were similar to those at the clay-loam site though more
pronounced (Fig. 1). Both cover and density were significantly
greater (P , 0.0001 and P , 0.0001, respectively) in the seed-
and-slash plots compared to the other treatments in 2004. Both
variables were also significantly greater (P , 0.0001 and
P , 0.0001, respectively) in 2005 in the seed-and-slash plots.
However, almost a twofold reduction of individuals per square
meter and a 0.1% decrease in foliar cover were observed in
seed-and-slash plots in 2005, whereas the slash treatment
increased from no cover in 2004 to an average of 0.8% cover in
2005. Grass species encountered at both sites and during both
posttreatment years were Elymus elymoides, Bouteloua curti-
pendula, and Aristida purpurea, all of which had been seeded.
Achnatherum hymenoides was also seeded but no seedlings
were found on experimental plots.
Proportions of reproductively active grasses were statically
greater in slash plots compared to nonslash plots at both the

tively). Across all slash plots, 40% and 43% had at least one
grass individual that was reproductively mature, whereas 3%
and 10% of the seed plots contained a reproductive grass
species (clay-loam and cinder site, respectively).
Litter Cover, Soil Exposure, and Soil Movement
Prior to treatment, no differences were evident in litter and
mineral soil cover at either the clay-loam or the cinder sites
(Table 2). Bare soil cover averaged 99% and litter cover was
less than 1% at both sites (Table 2). One year following
treatment, litter cover significantly increased in slash plots
compared to nonslash plots at both the clay-loam and the
cinder sites (P , 0.0001 and P , 0.0001, respectively). Litter
cover in slash plots averaged 87% and 91% at clay-loam and
cinder sites, respectively (Table 2).
Soil movement on plots where slash was added was
significantly lower at both the clay-loam and the cinder sites
(P , 0.0001 and P , 0.0001, respectively) compared to non-
slash plots for both posttreatment sampling years (Fig. 2). At
the clay-loam site, 2-yr mean soil loss for slash plots was
10.0 mm compared to 28.5 mm for nonslash plots. At the
cinder site, 2-yr mean soil movement for slash plots was
12.0 mm
and
30.3 mm
in
nonslash
plots.
Average
soil
movement on plots where we added slash was almost three
times lower than on plots without slash. Considerable year-to-
year variation occurred in soil movement; nevertheless, soil
movement in both sampling years was significantly lower in
slash treatments compared to nonslash treatments at both sites
(Fig 3). Incorporating only nonslash plots, soil movement was
also negatively correlated with vegetation cover at each site
(Fig. 4).
Soil Biota
Mycorrhizal fungi colonized all corn bait-plants in 2003 and
2004. Prior to treatment, no significant differences in AMP
were detected between treatment groups at either site. On
average, AMP at the clay-loam and cinder sites was 11.3% and
11.7%, respectively, before treatment. One year following
treatment, AMP was significantly greater (P , 0.0001 and
P , 0.0001) for soils from slash plots compared to nonslash
plots at both sites (Fig. 5). Percentage of root length colonized
by arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) fungi in slash plots was more
than two times greater than in nonslash plots at both sites. No
statistical differences were evident between the slash and the
seed-and-slash treatments at either site for AMP. Microbial
biomass C in soil samples collected in 2004 was also
significantly greater in slash plots compared to control plots
at both the clay-loam and cinder sites (P , 0.0001 and
P 5 0.036, respectively; Fig. 6).
Soil Chemistry
Prior to treatment, we found no significant differences in soil
pH, total N, or organic C between treatments at either site
(Table 3). Soil pH at both sites was approximately 7.7. Organic
C averaged across all treatments at the clay-loam and cinder
sites was 8.4 g ? kg21 and 10.3 g ? kg21, respectively. Total N
averaged less than 1.0 g ? kg21 at each site. NO3-N was

nonslash plots 1 yr after treatment (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
Vegetation Response
The seed-and-slash treatment led to a higher percentage of
grass cover, greater seedling emergence, and more reproductive
shoots on plants compared to the other treatments.
Although total grass cover was low 2 yr after treatment, cover
significantly increased across all seed-and-slash plots, expanding
from , 0.1% to as high as 3.9%. Grass composition was
composed primarily of seeded species and accounted for 19% of
the total cover (14.3%) and 49% of total density across all seed-
and-slash plots. Our results are consistent with other soil
amelioration studies using slash in pinyon–juniper woodlands
and demonstrate the benefits of this approach for increasing
grass establishment (Jacobs and Gatewood 1999; Brochway et
al. 2000; Wood and Javed 2001). Increased soil water
availability and protection from temperature extremes, resulting
from increased organic material, were likely the main factors
stimulating graminoid production (Harper 1977; Tongway and
Ludwig 1996; Champers 2000). Downed woody material can
also create obstructions that trap windblown seeds (Fowler
1986; Champers 2000), a process that may have contributed to
the slight increases of grass species we observed in the slash-only
treatment. Different responses among individual species were
noted, though not analyzed, in this study. Further research is
needed in order to identify optimal species for understory
restoration in pinyon–juniper woodlands.
Seed germination and plant establishment responses are
expected to vary with seasonal patterns of soil moisture
(Harper et al. 1965; Padien and Lajtha 1992). In our study,
precipitation in the second year was two times greater than the
decadal average and changes in total plant cover appeared to
correspond to the increased moisture. Other studies have also
reported positive responses to seeding during years of above-
average precipitation (Jacobs and Gatewood 1999; Brochway
et al. 2000; Wood and Javed 2001). For example, Jacobs and
Gatewood (1999) found no differences in seedling establish-
ment due to slash addition but seeded species increased in all
treatments compared to the pretreatment sampling year.
Further,
others
have
reported
little
success
in
seedling
establishment when seeding was done in drought years (Irwin
2006;
D. W. Huffman, M. T. Stoddard, P. Z. Fule´, W. W.
Covington, and H. B. Smith, unpublished data, 2005). These
studies suggest that interannual precipitation is a critical factor
in determining seedling fate, regardless of site preparation
treatments.
Several studies have indicated that germination and estab-
lishment are highly correlated with seed density (Seabloom et al.
2003; Sheley and Half 2006). Based on these findings and low
germination rates within pinyon–juniper systems, we elected to
seed at a higher rate (10 times greater) than typical land
management application. Our intent was to create possible
‘‘seed islands’’ or small patches of established vegetation in
hope
of
facilitating
vegetation
movement
beyond
theses
patches. In that regard, we would expect higher rates of
seeding within these patches to facilitate this movement,
though this conceptual framework requires further research.
However, seeded grass densities (Fig. 1) were 8 and 11 times
greater in the seed-and-slash treatment when compared to
seeded treatment at the clay-loam and cinder sites, respectively.
Therefore it appears that seed germination and establishment
are directly correlated with the number of seeds in favorable
microsite seedbeds, rather than the total number of available
seeds (Harper et al. 1965; Harper 1977).
Soil Movement
Scattering slash across plots decreased soil movement at both
sites. Soil movement after 2 yr was on average two to three
times less in slash treatments compared to nonslash treatments
at both sites. These effects were likely due to increases in litter
cover, as well as the physical soil barriers provided by branches

treatments at two different sites. Values indexed by a different letter are

and limbs. Other studies have reported similar decreases in
sediment yield following slash additions (Jacobs and Gatewood
1999; Wood and Javed 2001; Hastings et al. 2003). As with
vegetation establishment, soil movement may be expected to
vary with seasonal precipitation patterns. For example, we
found over four times more soil movement in nonslash plots in
2004 compared to 2005. An increase in total vegetation
between years also partially explained this variation. Soil
erosion can be highly dependent on variables such as rainfall
intensity, slope, scale of monitoring, amount of protective
cover on the soil surface, and soil taxonomy (Wilcox and
Breshears 1995; Hastings et al. 2003; Wilcox et al. 2003).
Wood et al. (1987) determined total herbaceous ground cover
to be the single most important variable in influencing sediment
runoff. Similarly, we found vegetation cover to be an important
factor in reducing sediment movement at our study sites.
Soil Biota and Chemistry
Soil biota, particularly AM fungi, have been shown to benefit
plants and shape the structure of plant communities by
Figure 4. Relationship between the absolute value of soil movement in 2004–2005 and total plant cover (%) in 2005. Total plant cover (%) was

increasing plant uptake of soil nutrients and increasing drought
tolerance (Perry et al. 1989; Allen 1991; Gallardo and
Schlesinger 1995). In our study, AMP and microbial biomass
C were higher in slash treatments compared to nonslash
treatments. Consequently, increases of both AMP and micro-
bial biomass C may have facilitated the successful establish-
ment of seeded grass species. However, because we did not
specifically control for AM fungi and microbial biomass in this
study, this conclusion needs further investigation. Other studies
have found that AM fungi can promote the establishment of
native plant cover in disturbed semiarid ecosystems and suggest
a relationship between disturbance recovery time and the
abundance of infective propagules of mycorrhizal fungi (Perry
et al. 1989; Allen 1991; Requena et al. 2001; Korb et al. 2004).
Conversely, AM fungal propagule densities typically remain
low after disturbance unless efforts are made to restore them.
Slash mulch treatments have been shown to increase microbial
populations as a result of increasing nutrient availability
(Lundgren 1982; Tongway and Ludwig 1996). In our study,
soil chemical properties exhibited no significant changes 1 yr
following treatments, although NO3-N decreased in the slash
treatment compared to the nonslash treatment. This decrease
may be related to the immobilization of NO3-N through
increased microbial activity (Allen 1991; Gallardo and Schle-
singer 1995; Murty et al. 1996). Indeed, increasing organic
material most likely created an environment that was more
conducive to soil biota recruitment.
MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS
Understory conditions of many pinyon–juniper woodlands in
the western United States are showing symptoms of degrada-
tion likely resulting from overuse and tree competition (Cottam
and Stewart 1940; West 1984; Tausch and West 1995;
Davenport et al. 1996). Land managers are therefore interested
in approaches that may help restore the ecological integrity and
biodiversity of theses ecosystems. However, substantial vari-
ability in site characteristic and community structure across the
range of this vegetation type reduces the ability to generalize
about treatment expectations from one woodland community
to another. For example, although not rigorously tested in our
study, grass establishment under slash treatment appeared to be
higher on cinder soils than loamy soils, suggesting soil texture
or surface properties likely affect plant emergence and growth
(Harper et al. 1965; Winkel et al. 1991; Chambers 2000).
Furthermore, not all seeded grass species established equally
well in our experiment, thus careful consideration should be
given to species performance when choosing seed mixes. In
addition, our results demonstrated that surface-sown seeds
without additional soil preparation had limited germination
success. Finally, climatic factors such as low precipitation and
extreme
temperature
variation
are
frequent
in
semiarid
woodlands (Betancourt 1996; Swetnam et al. 1999) and exert
overriding effects that often determine whether a revegetation
project succeeds or fails.
Recent research in various semiarid environments has shown
that slash mulch treatments may improve soil conditions and
create ‘‘islands’’ of elevated soil fertility, thereby assisting the
recovery of degraded plant communities (Tongway and Ludwig
1996; Breshears et al. 1998; Jacobs and Gatewood 1999;
Woods and Javed 2001; Brockway et al. 2002; Hastings et al.
2003). Our results confirm that scattered woody material can
promote the establishment of grasses, improve soil conditions,
and possibly enhance important soil–plant interactions. Thus, it
appears these treatments hold promise for contributing to the
