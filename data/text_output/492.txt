Western Pine Forests with
Continuing Frequent Fire Regimes:
Possible Reference Sites for
Management
Scott L. Stephens and Peter Z. Fule´
In contrast to a few isolated forests in northern Mexico, most forests in the western Untied States have
been signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by ﬁre suppression, harvesting, and livestock grazing. This has increased
their ﬁre hazards and many are in need of restoration. Understanding reference conditions is
challenging because we have few intact forests functioning under the continuing inﬂuence of climate
variation, insects, diseases, and frequent ﬁres. This article summarizes information from reference sites
and argues for incorporating natural heterogeneity in restoration targets across similar forests in the
United States.

T
o describe reference conditions in
surface-ﬁre–adapted forests, man-
agers increasingly rely on photo-
graphic evidence, written historical ac-
counts, early forest inventory data, and
studies that reconstruct pre–Euro-American
conditions from living and dead woody ma-
terial. In doing so, often, it is assumed that
these historical conditions would prevail to-
day in the absence of ﬁre exclusion. How-
ever, the interaction of climatic variation,
forests, and ﬁre is complex, making it uncer-
tain if similar prehistorical conditions would
have occurred in the present environment
(Millar and Wolfenden 1999, Stephens et al.
2003). As a result, there are few forests in
western North America that could serve as
models or “controls” for forests functioning
under the continuing inﬂuence of climate
variation, insects, diseases, and frequent
ﬁres.
Conifer forests in isolated ranges of
northern Mexico have not experienced sys-
tematic ﬁre suppression and some have not
been harvested (Table 1). Although most
have been grazed to varying levels of inten-
sity, the absence of systematic ﬁre suppres-
sion suggests these forests may provide in-
formation useful for developing descriptions
of reference conditions for similar forests in
the southwestern United States and else-
where. A handful of US forests, mostly re-
mote sites in National Parks or Wilderness
Areas, also exhibit relatively undisrupted
disturbance regions (Table 1).
In this article we summarize informa-
tion on pine-dominated forests in south-
western North America (northwestern Mex-
ico and southwestern United States) that
have relatively intact disturbance regimes.
This information could be used by managers
interested in restoring similar forests in the
region, particularly in western forests that
have experienced a signiﬁcant increase in
area burned over the last 60 years (Stephens
2005). To enhance the clarity of the com-
parisons, we present information from
paired ﬁre/no-ﬁre sites or others that are
cross-border comparisons. This approach
attempts to isolate the effect of ﬁre manage-
ment on these ecosystems. We focus espe-
cially on our research in Baja California and
the Grand Canyon, Arizona.
Reference Areas
Reference or “relict” sites are rare be-
cause most landscapes have been impacted
heavily by industrial human society in the
past 100–150 years. The term “relict” refers
to isolated places that were unimpacted or
less impacted, although it does not mean
that these ecosystems are “museum pieces”
maintained in a constant state. Grazing and
timber harvesting have been nearly ubiqui-
tous in northwestern Mexico, especially
since the creation of communal landhold-
ings called ejidos in the early 20th century
(Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003). However,
organized ﬁre suppression has not been a na-
tional priority in Mexico. As a result, fre-
quent ﬁre regimes persisted into the late
20th centuries in a few protected areas such
as the Sierra San Pedro Ma´rtir (SSPM), Baja
California, and La Michilı´a Biosphere Re-
serve, Durango (Table 1; Figure 1).
Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi)–mixed coni-
fer forests have been studied in the SSPM, an

mately 85 mi southeast of Ensenada, Baja
California, Mexico. Vegetation of the SSPM
is composed of conifer forests and shrub-
lands of the Californian ﬂoristic province
that occur in no other area of Mexico (Min-
nich and Franco 1998). The SSPM is the
southern terminus of the Peninsular Moun-
tain Range that begins at the boundary be-
tween the San Jacinto and San Bernardino
Mountains in California; approximately
215 mi separates the SSPM from the San
Bernardino Mountains and the ﬂoras and
soils in these areas are very similar.
The mixed conifer forests of the SSPM
have experienced neither tree harvesting nor
a policy of large-scale ﬁre suppression. Lim-
ited ﬁre suppression began in the 1970s but
has only consisted of one or two four-person
hand crews in the summer and fall periods
(Stephens et al. 2003). The climate in the
SSPM is Mediterranean with annual precip-
itation of approximately 22 in. (Minnich et
al. 2000). Median ﬁre return intervals in for-
ests in the SSPM are shorter than 15 years
(Table 1); similar ﬁre return intervals once
occurred in the Jeffrey pine and mixed coni-
fer forests in the eastern Sierra Nevada and
San Bernardino Mountains before ﬁre sup-
pression was initiated early in the 20th cen-
tury (Stephens et al. 2003). SSPM ﬁre sea-
son is approximately June–early Aug.,
unlike most California forests that were once
dominated by late season or dormant season
ﬁres (Stephens et al. 2003).
In the United States, true relicts include
physically inaccessible areas, such as steep
mesas at Zion National Park (Madany and
West 1983) or forest patches isolated by
sharp lava ﬂows at El Malpais, New Mexico
(Grissino-Mayer and Swetnam 1997). Al-
though protected from human impacts,
these unusual sites may be inherently differ-
ent from larger forestlands. For example,
one Zion site had ﬁre-free intervals much
longer than those at any other ponderosa
pine (Pinus ponderosa) reference site, per-
haps because the small mesa had few ignition
opportunities (Table 1). The larger pro-

the Gila Wilderness, were grazed by live-
stock and most ﬁres were suppressed until
natural ﬁre policies were implemented in the
1970s. However, even with some disruption
to the ﬁre regime, these quasi-reference
landscapes conserve features such as old
trees, native species, and resilience to severe
ﬁres.
At Grand Canyon National Park in
northern Arizona, ﬁres ceased in ponderosa
pine forests as early as 1880 because of live-
stock grazing, but occasional ﬁres continued
after 1880 in isolated areas near the canyon
rim. Although the post-1880 ﬁre regime
changed from about two dozen ﬁres per cen-
tury to only a few, the forests were never
harvested and livestock grazing was elimi-
nated in the 1930s. Fule´ et al. (2002) argued
that evidence from forest structure, fuel
loads, and native plant communities (Gildar
et al. 2004) indicated that the relict Grand
Canyon forests remained relatively similar
to their pre–Euro-American conditions (see
Figure 3). The climate in this region is mon-
soonal.
Forest Structure, Variability,
and Species Composition
Forests in the SSPM are composed of
Jeffrey pine, white ﬁr (Abies concolor), sugar
pine (Pinus lambertiana), lodgepole pine
(Pinus contorta var. murrayana), and limited
amounts of incense-cedar (Calocedrus decur-
rens) and quaking aspen (Populas tremu-
loides; Figure 1). The most common forest
types are Jeffrey pine, Jeffrey pine–mixed co-
nifer, and mixed white ﬁr forests, respec-
tively (Minnich and Franco 1998). Soils in
our sampled areas are Entisols (derived from
diorite parent materials) that are shallow,
well to excessively drained, and relatively
acidic (Stephens and Gill 2005). Our re-
search is located on the northern plateau of
the SSPM at an approximately 8,500-ft ele-
vation.
Forest structure has been inventoried
using a systematic grid of plots (Stephens
2004, Stephens and Gill 2005). High vari-
ability characterized all live tree, snag, and
fuel attributes measured in the forests of the
SSPM. This high amount of variability is
probably the result of the relatively intact
frequent surface ﬁre regime and because no
harvesting has ever occurred in this forest.
High variability in surface fuel loads would
produce equally diverse ﬁre behavior and ef-
fects, and this would maintain high spatial
heterogeneity if the forest continues to burn
under a frequent ﬁre regime (Stephens
2004).
Examples of the high variation in forest
structure are summarized in the following
paragraphs from an area of approximately
500 ac (Table 2). In this area, average dbh in
Jeffrey pine–mixed conifer forests was 13 in.
(range, 1–44 in.; Stephens and Gill [2005]).
Average tree density was 59 trees  ac1
(range, 12–130 trees ac). Average basal area
was 86 ft2  ac1 (range, 25–220 ft2  ac1).
Approximately 20% of the sampled plots
had a basal area below 60 ft2  ac1, 60% of
plots had basal areas from 60 to 95 ft2  ac1,
and 20% of plots had basal areas of 95–220
ft2  ac1. Average canopy cover was 25.3%

[2005]) and the amount of area in regener-
ation patches was 3.8% (Stephens and Fry
2005).
Average surface fuel loads were 6.6 tons
 ac1 (range, 0.01–69 tons  ac1; Table 2;
Stephens [2004]). Total surface fuel load
was less than the average load in 73% of the
sampled area. Surface fuel load was greater
than 8 tons  ac1 on 24% of plots and
greater than 16 tons  ac1 on 8% of plots.
Average 1,000-hour fuel load was 5.9 tons 
ac1 (Stephens 2004). Thirty-seven percent
of plots had no 1,000-hour fuels and 67%
had less than the average 1,000-hour load.
Most structural attributes measured in the
SSPM varied by approximately one order of
magnitude even though the area sampled
has similar aspects, slopes, soils, and domi-
nant tree species.
Average snag density in 2003 was 2.06
snags  ac1 (range, 0–10.1 snags  ac1; Ta-
ble 2) and 26% of sampled plots had no
snags (Stephens 2004). Mortality during the
severe drought from 1999 to 2003 increased
snag density by approximately 0.5 snags 
ac1. Less than the average snag density
(2.06 snags  ac1) was recorded on 71% of
the sampled area. The foregoing data under-
score the high degree of variability for a
range of stand parameters in relict forests in
northern Mexico. Mixed conifer forests in
the San Bernardino Mountains of southern
California also have experienced increased
mortality during a similar drought (1999–
2003), but the increase in snag density was
much greater, estimated at approximately 50
trees  ac1 in many areas (Sims [2004]; Ta-
ble 2; Figure 2). Fire suppression has in-
creased tree densities in this area, and when
this was coupled to a multiyear drought, na-
tive bark beetles killed millions of trees
(Eatough-Jones et al. 2004). In contrast,
similar bark beetle–induced tree mortality
did not occur in the SSPM during the
1999–2003 drought (an average of 0.5 new
snags  ac1 was produced in the SSPM dur-
ing the 1999–2003 drought; Stephens
[2004]).
Analysis of relict and nonreference sites
in the United States affords information
about potential effects of management (es-
pecially ﬁre suppression) on stand character-
istics. In 1932 mixed Jeffrey pine forests in
the San Bernardino Mountains of southern
California had an average density of 38 trees
 ac1 (including trees with more than 5-in.
dbh; Minnich et al. [1995]). Tree density
from the SSPM for all trees with more than
4-in. dbh was 44 trees  ac1, which is simi-
lar to that reported in the San Bernardino
Mountains before large-scale ﬁre suppres-
sion or harvesting. In 1992, mixed Jeffrey
pine forests in the San Bernardino Moun-
tains had tree densities 79% larger than
those in the early 1930s mainly because of
ﬁre suppression (Table 2; Minnich et al.
[1995]).
Ponderosa pine forests at relict Grand
Canyon sites retain an open stand structure,
resistant to stand-replacing ﬁre, while exhib-
iting high variability especially in the decid-
uous forest component (Table 2; Figure 3).
These forests are located on high plateaus at
an approximately 7,500-ft elevation with
well-drained soils derived from Kaibab lime-
stone. Gambel oak (Quercus gambellii) and
New Mexican locust (Robinia neomexicana)
regenerate effectively by sprouting after ﬁre,
creating a shrubby midstory in some re-
gions. Average pine densities ranged from 85
to 101 trees  ac1 and deciduous species
varied from 24 trees  ac1 (N.M. locust at
Powell Plateau) to as many as 264 trees 
ac1 (Gambel oak at Rainbow Plateau; Fule´
et al. [2002]). On individual plots, oak den-
sities reached over 1,000 trees  ac1 (Fule´ et
al. 2002).
The contribution of deciduous trees to
the forest basal area at the relic Grand Can-
yon sites is much less—oaks and locust av-
eraged 4–24 ft2  ac1, compared with 95–
133 ft2  ac1 for ponderosa pine and the
pines comprise the great majority of canopy
fuels—but the structural heterogeneity of
the broad-leaved trees is likely very impor-
tant for wildlife habitat and plant diversity
(Table 2; Gildar et al. [2004] and Laughlin
et al. [2004]). Canopy cover ranged from 48
to 52% (Fule´ et al. 2002). Surface fuel loads
(all woody fuels) ranged from 8.2 to 20.8
tons/ac; rotten coarse woody debris (1,000-
hour fuels) made up only 8–36% of the to-
tal, likely because of repeated ﬁres that fore-
stalled the development of large quantities of
rotten downed wood (P.Z. Fule´, unpub-
lished data).
For comparison to nonreference condi-
tions, at a paired site in the park where ﬁre
exclusion had occurred since 1887 (Grand-
view), pine density averaged 261 trees  ac1
and oaks averaged 118 trees  ac1 (Table 2;
Fule´ et al. [2002]). Pine density at Grand-
view was similar to the overall average pon-
derosa density for the state of Arizona, 250
trees  ac1 (O’Brien 2002). Basal area at
Grandview was less than at any of the refer-
ence sites, however (average, 73.3 ft2  ac1
for pine), indicating that most pines were of
small size.
Modern Fire Behavior in
Reference Sites
Are severe ﬁres in recent years primarily
a function of increased fuel or of worsening
ﬁre weather? Modern ﬁres burn differently
in reference sites than in neighboring ﬁre-
excluded forests, offering anecdotal insight
into this question, although the number of
examples is very limited. In June 2003, the
Aspen wildﬁre burned with stand-replacing
intensity near Tucson, Arizona (not a refer-

ence site), whereas a wildland-use ﬁre on
Powell Plateau, Grand Canyon, Arizona (a
reference site) burned with low intensity
(Figure 4). The Aspen ﬁre burned over
84,000 ac, destroying 333 structures. Over
1,200 ﬁre personnel and 14 aircraft were
used in the ﬁreﬁghting effort, for a total sup-
pression cost exceeding $16,000,000 (data
from Coronado National Forest). In con-
trast, the 3,500-ac Powell ﬁre damaged no
resources and was managed by a staff of
more than 40 with one helicopter (data from
Grand Canyon National Park). Similarly, a
ﬁre at La Michilı´a Biosphere Reserve, Du-
rango, during the severe El Nin˜o ﬁre year of
1998 caused minimal tree mortality, but a
ﬁreﬁghter was tragically killed in a needless
suppression effort (Rodrı´guez-Trejo and
Fule´ 2003).
Observations of reduced ﬁre severity in
reference sites are rare but similar ﬁndings
come from more extensive dendroecological
and ﬁre modeling studies. Compared with
nearby ﬁre-excluded forests, reference for-
ests at Grand Canyon were less dense and
had the smallest 20th century increases in
canopy biomass, canopy bulk density, and
crownﬁre hazard as measured by crowning
index (windspeed needed to maintain can-
opy burning; Fule´ et al. [2004]). Fire mod-
eling showed that in 1880, only 6% of the
entire landscape of North Rim of Grand
Canyon was vulnerable to stand-replacing
ﬁre at a windspeed of 28 mi  hr1. By 2000,
increased forest density in ponderosa and
higher-elevation forests outside the relict ar-
eas caused 33% of the landscape to be sus-
ceptible to stand-replacing ﬁre at the same
windspeed threshold (Fule´ et al. 2004).
Management Implications
In many areas of the western United
States with ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pine, and
mixed conifer forests, past harvesting has re-
moved the largest trees and ﬁre suppression
and livestock grazing have increased under-
story tree density and fuel loads. Information
from forests with relatively intact disturbance
regimes can assist in the development of de-
sired conditions in some US forests. Reference
forests are especially useful because they have
been functioning under the continuing in-
ﬂuence of climate variation, insects, diseases,
and frequent ﬁres. These reference sites are
incredibly valuable and should be protected
in the future. At the same time, it is impor-
tant to recognize the limitation of relict areas
for making broader inferences. Often, these
sites occur in areas where biophysical condi-
tions are somewhat different from the dom-
inant areas (steep slopes, isolated areas, and
ﬁre seasonality), so ﬁre history and effects
also may be different from historical patterns
in target management areas. Other factors
include the relatively small size of most re-
licts, affecting landscape-scale processes, and
the lack of appropriate relicts for many forest
types.
The patchy distribution of forest struc-
ture observed from the forests in the SSPM,
Grand
Canyon,
and
elsewhere
argues
against the application of uniform targets for
snag retention, fuels, and live trees across
similar forest landscapes. An improvement
in management guidelines would be to man-
age for forest structures over moderate spa-
tial scales (hundreds to thousands of acres)
instead of on a stand (10–20 ac) basis (Ste-
phens 2004). An example of ﬁne-scaled for-
est restoration was undertaken by Coving-
ton et al. (1997), where the pre–ﬁre-
exclusion structure of a ponderosa pine
forest was used as a template to guide thin-
ning.
Flexible
and
heterogeneous
ap-
proaches would enable managers to meet
management standards by maintaining high
snag densities and large fuel loads over only a
portion of the forested landscape. This
would require ﬂexibility in the application
of restoration treatments, something that is
rare in US federal land management (Ste-
phens and Ruth 2005). It is important to
restrict our interpretation of these ﬁndings
to areas with similar species, disturbance re-
gimes, and abiotic environments (Dibble
and Rees 2005), because forests have a great
deal of variation.
Because of forest variation and our in-
sufﬁcient knowledge of the ecological, eco-
nomic, and social effects of different restora-
tion treatments that can be used to reduce
ﬁre hazards in western US forests (Stephens
and Moghaddas 2005), we need to develop
vigorous adaptive management programs.
Such programs would use a rigorous system
of monitoring, experimentation, and re-
search to improve ﬁre and fuels management
policies, strategies, and projects (Stephens
and Ruth 2005). Information from the ref-
erence forests in northern Mexico and the
southwestern United States can assist in the
development of desired conditions and will
allow scientists to understand how intact
forests will respond to future conditions.
