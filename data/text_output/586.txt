ABSTRACT We assessed responses of the breeding bird community to mechanical thinning and prescribed surface fire, alone and in
combination, between 2000 and 2006 in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in northern Arizona, USA. Fuel-reduction treatments did not
affect species richness or evenness, and effects on density of 5 commonly detected species varied among species. Populations of some species,
such as the western bluebird (Sialia mexicana), increased following burning treatments, whereas others, such as the mountain chickadee (Poecile
gambeli), decreased in response to thinning treatments. Our results also identified a temporal response component, where avian community
composition and structure changed synchronously on all treatments over time. Given the modest effects these small-scale fuel-reduction
treatments had on avian composition and the specific density responses of particular species, our results suggest that land managers should
consider implementing prescribed surface fire after thinning projects, where appropriate. (JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT

KEY WORDS Arizona, avian community diversity, Fire and Fire Surrogates, ponderosa pine.
Many southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests
in the United States were characterized by park-like stands
prior to Euro–American settlement in the late 1800s
(Harrington and Sackett 1990, Stone et al. 1999). This
open structure was maintained by low-intensity surface ﬁres
that burned at intervals of 2–20 years prior to a management
paradigm focused on ﬁre suppression (Harrington and
Sackett 1990, Covington and Moore 1994). Fire, along with
other natural episodic events such as drought, insect
infestation, and pine regeneration created a natural range
of variability across a heterogeneous landscape (Allen et al.
2002). Interruption of the natural disturbance regime
coupled with human activities, such as logging and grazing,
caused substantial changes to the composition and structure
of southwestern ponderosa pine forests (Covington et al.
1997, Allen et al. 2002, Youngblood et al. 2004). For
example, exclusion of ﬁre allowed accumulation of surface
and ladder fuels, and intensive logging removed many of the
larger diameter trees, leaving behind relatively homogeneous
stands of small-diameter trees (Covington and Moore 1994,
Fule´ et al. 1997, Allen et al. 2002, Agee and Skinner 2005).
Grazing practices resulted in reductions in the herbaceous
cover and ﬁne fuels that facilitated the spread of naturally
caused low-intensity surface ﬁres (Harrington and Sackett
1990, Allen et al. 2002). These factors, combined with
several exceptionally wet years in the early 1900s, have led to
forest stands with dense forest structures well outside the
range of natural variability (Cooper 1960, Covington and
Moore 1994, Agee and Skinner 2005).
In the past decade, the severity and size of wildﬁres in the
Southwest have increased dramatically, leading to changes
in forest management that focus on restoration including
implementation of fuel-reduction treatments such as thin-
ning and burning across large areas (Covington 2000, Allen
et al. 2002, Agee and Skinner 2005, Noss et al. 2006).
Although scientists are still gaining information on effects
of mechanical thinning and prescribed ﬁre on wildlife, these
treatments are being used increasingly in the Southwest to
reduce fuel accumulations and ﬁre risk. In some cases,
mechanical thinning and prescribed ﬁre have been imple-
mented so as to mimic natural disturbance and to recreate
forest structural characteristics that existed prior to Euro–
American settlement (Covington 2000, Meyer et al. 2001).
Often, such restoration treatments are assumed to provide
favorable habitat conditions for native biota because they
return ecosystem processes to some reference or natural
condition (Block et al. 2001). However, these assumptions
remain largely untested (Block et al. 2001).
Several studies in the Southwest have evaluated effects of
prescribed ﬁre, thinning treatments of various intensities, or
a combination of thinning and burning in a restoration
framework (Szaro and Balda 1986, Horton and Mannan
1988, King and DeGraaf 2000, Germaine and Germaine
2002). Much of our understanding of effects of ﬁre on bird
communities, however, is based on observational studies
after postﬁre salvage logging or wildﬁre (Kotliar et al. 2002,
Saab et al. 2004, Bock and Block 2005, Saab and Powell
2005). We reviewed the literature to frame expectations
about predicted responses of 5 common species to treat-
ments. Focal species included dark-eyed junco ( Junco
hyemalis), mountain chickadee (Poecile gambeli), pygmy

nuthatch (Sitta pygmaea), western bluebird (Sialia mexica-
na), and yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica coronata). We
hypothesized that western bluebird densities would increase
in burned areas because previous research showed an
increase in abundance after ﬁre (Overturf 1979, Blake
1982, Szaro and Balda 1986). As insectivores, western
bluebirds may beneﬁt from increased insect populations
following ﬁre (Guinan et al. 2000, Saint-Germain et al.
2004). We expected a negative response by mountain
chickadees because they are typically more abundant in
unburned areas and have been shown to respond negatively
to severe wildﬁre (Aulenbach and O’Shea-Stone 1983,
Johnson and Wauer 1996, Saab and Powell 2005). For dark-
eyed junco, pygmy nuthatch, and yellow-rumped warbler,
we expected a mixed response to treatments because
previous research showed equivocal responses to wildﬁre
and fuels treatments (Lowe et al. 1978, Bock and Bock
1983, Saab and Powell 2005).
To better understand how fuel-reduction treatments affect
passerines in ponderosa pine forests, our objectives were to
quantify changes in avian diversity responses to forest fuel-
reduction treatments and to more closely evaluate the
population-level response of several common species.
Speciﬁcally, we examined whether: 1) fuel-reduction treat-
ments affect avian diversity, 2) avian community composi-
tion and structure change over time, and 3) fuel-reduction
treatments affect density of more common species. Accord-
ingly, we developed a series of predictions for selected
species, but we anticipated considerable variation in density
response among treatments and species.
STUDY AREA
We conducted our study at 3 sites in northern Arizona,
USA, located on the Kaibab (KA Hill: 35812.0033.900
latitude, 111844.0032.200 longitude) and Coconino (Power-
line: 35812.0033.900 latitude, 111845.0032.200 longitude;
Rudd’s Tank: 35814.0005.900 latitude, 111844.0058.400 longi-
tude) National Forests. Overstory at these sites was
dominated by ponderosa pine, but also included Gambel
oak (Quercus gambelii), one-seed juniper ( Juniperus mono-
sperma), and alligator juniper ( J. deppeana). Mature, yellow-
bark ponderosa pine trees were present in small numbers,
whereas small-diameter (dbh ,25 cm) trees were common
at all sites resulting from previous timber harvest activities
(Dickson et al. 2004). Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) and
blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) were the most common plants
in the understory vegetation. Topography at these sites was
mostly ﬂat with mean elevation of 2,193 m (6100 SD).
Average annual temperature was 6.58 C (610.6 SD) and
average annual precipitation was 53.1 cm (60.8) for the
period 2005–2006 (Huebner 2006).
METHODS
Experimental Design
To assess the response of the avian community to fuel-
reduction treatments, we used a modiﬁed Before-After–
Control-Impact experimental design (Green 1979; Stewart-
Oaten et al. 1986, 1992). Each of the 3 study sites was
established as a block (n ¼ 3 replicates) within which each of
4 experimental fuel-reduction treatments was applied: a
control, thin only, prescribed ﬁre only, and thin followed by
prescribed ﬁre (Fig. 1). Treatments were assigned to units
within the block at random; however in 2 blocks random
treatment locations were constrained to 1 of 2 (rather than 1
of 4) units to reduce cost of treatment implementation (J.
Bailey, Oregon State University, personal communication).
Treatments were chosen to represent currently implemented
treatments in many southwestern ponderosa pine forests.
Treatment units ranged in size from 16 ha to 30 ha. United
States Forest Service district personnel implemented thin-
ning treatments in autumn 2002 and prescribed surface ﬁre
treatments in autumn 2003 for each site using strip-head ﬁre
techniques (Faiella and Bailey 2007). Treatments aimed to
reduce stem density to 116 trees/ha and basal area to 13 m2/
ha (Faiella and Bailey 2007).
Avian Sampling
To evaluate treatment effects on avian composition,
diversity, and density, we surveyed birds during the breeding
season (late May through early Jul) of each sampling year.
We surveyed birds between 2000 and 2002 for pretreatment
data and between 2003 and 2006 for posttreatment data.
We established a 36-point sampling array within each
treatment unit, typically as a 6 3 6 grid, with 50 m between
points, which comprised a 10-ha core sampling area (Fig. 1).
Regardless of array shape, we maintained a buffer zone of
50 m between points and the edge of the treatment.
To quantify how forest treatments inﬂuenced avian
community structure, we used estimates of species richness
based on ﬁrst-order jackknife estimator and evenness based
on Simpson’s index (inverse, 1/D), a measure that increases
as community assemblage becomes more even (Magurran

and the 36-point sampling array in each treatment unit for one of the 3
replicate blocks in northern Arizona, USA, 2000–2006.

2004). We calculated diversity measures for each treatment
unit for all sites and all years sampled using the EstimateS
Software Program (V7.5; Colwell 2005). We estimated
mean and variance for species richness and species evenness
using 1,000 bootstrap randomizations (Sokal and Rohlf
1995). We analyzed species richness estimates and Simp-
son’s diversity indices for treatment effects in an analysis of
variance that included site as a random blocking factor and
treatment, treatment period, and years within treatment
period as ﬁxed factors. We considered estimates for multiple
years on the same treatment unit within site repeated
measurements. We used interactions between treatment and
treatment period to gauge treatment effects.
We used nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS)
with Bray–Curtis distances to examine avian species
composition and abundance by treatment (McCune and
Mefford 1999). Pretreatment data were pooled among years
and each additional year represented a year since treatment
implementation. We then used Bray–Curtis dissimilarity to
assess differences in avian community composition among
treatments, where parameter estimates indicate the relative
importance of corresponding environmental variables (Dyer
1978). Environmental variables included in this analysis
were treatment, site, and year. Each data point in the
NMDS plot represented the relative abundance of all species
present in a given treatment unit for a given year.
We used a distance-based sampling approach to estimate
avian density before and after treatment (Buckland et al.
2001). At each sampling point, we recorded all bird species
detected by sight or sound during a 5-minute period but
excluded from analysis birds that ﬂew across the sample area.
We estimated distance from the observer to each bird up to
50 m. We conducted surveys between 30 minutes after
sunrise and 1000 hours, with 9–12 points visited per day.
Using this sampling scheme, we made 3–4 visits to each
treatment unit spaced over the breeding season, with each
point visited only once. We arranged sampling points into
transects to minimize sampling radius overlap on any given
day, and we selected transects at random. Use of distance
sampling allowed us to relax assumptions of spatial
independence among our closely spaced sampling points
because distance-based models are robust to detection of the
same individuals during different sampling periods or at .1
sampling station (Buckland et al. 2001).
For each focal species, we used Program DISTANCE
(V5.0; Thomas et al. 2005) to estimate density (individuals/
10 ha) by treatment. Because thin and burn treatments were
completed in different years, we computed densities
separately for 3 periods: a pretreatment period (2000–
2002), a post-thin period (2003–2006), and a post-thin and
post-burn period (2004–2006). For each species, we
considered year, study site, and treatment type as covariate
factors in the estimation of a global detection probability
using the multiple covariate distance sampling (MCDS)
analysis engine in DISTANCE (see Buckland et al. 2004,
Marques and Buckland 2004). We used MCDS instead of
conventional distance sampling analysis because we required
species- and stratum-speciﬁc estimates, and because the
MCDS approach was more robust to small sample size
(Marques and Buckland 2004). Importantly, because we
used a global detection function to estimate species density
by treatment, our stratiﬁed estimates are not independent
and have associated variance estimates that are biased low
(Buckland et al. 2001). We used Akaike’s Information
Criterion (AIC) to select a model for density from a
candidate set that included all possible factor combinations
(Burnham and Anderson 2002). When differences in AICc
values for competing models were 2, we averaged density
estimates and computed unconditional standard errors
(Burnham and Anderson 2002).
To quantify the magnitude of change in estimated density
of each focal species to individual treatments in the pre- and
post-treatment periods, we estimated the difference in
density (D-pre and D-post, respectively) by subtracting
control density from treatment density. We then calculated
a standardized difference (D*) by subtracting D-pretreat-
ment density from D-post-treatment to determine the
cumulative response (or the difference in differences) to a
treatment by a given species. We considered this measure
equivalent to the time 3 treatment interaction.
RESULTS
Although estimates varied among replicates, basal area of
control and burn-only treatments were virtually unchanged
after treatment (Table 1). Basal area of thin-only and thin-
and-burn treatments was reduced by approximately 50%
(Faiella and Bailey 2007; J. Bailey, unpublished data). Tree
density was unchanged after treatment in control and
reduced ,10% in burn-only treatments (Faiella and Bailey
2007). However, tree density was reduced by approximately
60–70% in thin-only and thin-and-burn treatments (Faiella
and Bailey 2007; J. Bailey, unpublished data).

We recorded 7,363 detections among 63 avian species
during the 2000–2006 breeding seasons. Species richness
(F3,8 ¼ 0.15; P ¼ 0.93) and evenness (F3,8 ¼ 0.52; P ¼ 0.68)
did not change in response to treatment (Fig. 2).
Although there was little difference in the avian
communities among treatments, communities in all 4
treatments followed the same pattern of movement through
ordination space over time (Fig. 3). This synchronous
change in the avian community through time was reﬂected
in the amount of dissimilarity among treatments, which
averaged 0.41 6 0.003 (SE) and increased to 0.51 6 0.004
between years. Differences in avian community structure
were 6 times greater among years than among sites, and 8
times greater than among treatments.
Responses of focal species to treatments varied consid-
erably. Changes in dark-eyed junco density ranged from a
9% decrease to a 29% increase on the thin-only and burn-
only treatments, respectively, relative to control (Fig. 4). In
contrast, mountain chickadee densities declined on all
treatments, most on the thin-only treatment, where density
was reduced by .50% during the posttreatment period to
2.3 individuals/10 ha (60.8 SE). Pygmy nuthatch densities
remained constant across treatments except the thin-and-
burn treatments, where densities increased by .500%.
Western bluebird densities increased on all treatments with
densities more than doubling on the burn-only and thin-
and-burn treatments. Yellow-rumped warbler demonstrated
a mixed response to treatments, with the largest change in
density on the thin-and-burn treatment, which decreased by
100%.
DISCUSSION
Treatments to reduce forest fuels across the range we
studied had little effect on avian diversity over our 4-year
study but did affect some aspects of species composition and
abundance. High annual variation, however, obscured clear
and consistent patterns. Our results suggest that although
the small-scale forest treatments we studied may have
inﬂuenced the avian species present, natural annual variation
in density was a stronger source of variation. In contrast to
our results, Szaro and Balda (1986) found that both weather
and various intensities of forest-thinning treatments inﬂu-
enced bird density and species richness but that treatments
had a greater inﬂuence on community composition.
Fuel-reduction treatments in ponderosa pine forests
affected the focal species in different ways. Increases in
western bluebird densities on treatments that included ﬁre
(i.e., burn-only and thin-and-burn treatments) likely
resulted from a combination of opening the understory
vegetation and an increase in foraging opportunities due to
burning. Western bluebird is commonly associated with
sites that have recently burned, and our results indicate a
strong positive response to both thinning and burning
treatments (Overturf 1979, Bock and Block 2005, Saab and
Powell 2005). Wightman and Germaine (2006) suggest that
restoration treatments that decrease tree densities and
increase herbaceous vegetation may provide a more
abundant food resource and generally improve habitat
quality for bluebirds, an explanation consistent with our
ﬁndings.
Given the low number of detections for mountain
chickadee, it was difﬁcult to calculate density of this species
as it decreased on all treatments and appeared most sensitive
to the thin-only treatment. Mountain chickadee has been
shown to be negatively affected by different timber
management practices, and the reductions in density we
observed are consistent with previous research in Arizona
mixed-conifer forests (Franzreb 1978, McCallum et al.
1999).
The magnitude of density change by pygmy nuthatches on
thin-and-burn treatments was unexpected. Several studies

have found that abundance of this species was reduced after
wildﬁres (Lowe et al. 1978, Overturf 1979, Blake 1982,
Bock and Block 2005). Removal of snags by wildﬁre events
is usually responsible for the decline seen in pygmy nuthatch
densities. However, the high density of snags on the study
sites, and the persistence of many snags following treat-
ments, suggests that prescribed ﬁre and thinning, as
implemented on these experimental treatments did not
have the negative impacts expected following wildﬁre.
Our ﬁne-scaled, replicated experiment provides a detailed
look at short-term responses in density to small-scale changes
in forest structure following management treatments com-
mon in the Southwest. Results from small-scale plots such as
these may also be confounded by the close proximity of
treatments, such that some bird species may be responding to
the collection of treatments rather than individual treat-
ments. Notably, results of our study are consistent with
emerging, large-scale studies of avian community response to
forest treatments in the region (e.g., Short 2003, Dickson
2006, Pope 2006). Collectively, this work suggests that as
managers move forward with landscape-level forest treat-
ments designed to reduce ﬁre risk and reintroduce appro-
priate ﬁre as a critical forest process, overall effects on forest
passerine assemblages are likely to be modest.

nuthatch, western bluebird, and yellow-rumped warbler) on the 3 replicate blocks in northern Arizona, USA, 2000–2006. We calculated cumulative response
(D*) as the difference between post- and pretreatment density for each species by treatment. A positive number indicates an increase and a negative number
indicates a decrease in density.

MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS
Species that responded positively to thinning treatments
used areas that had an average basal area that ranged
between 12–15 m2/ha and stem density between 140–189
trees/ha across sites. We recommend that future small-scale
fuel-reduction treatments in southwestern ponderosa pine
forests be implemented within this range of forest character-
istics, values that are also consistent with the range of 1887
conditions reconstructed for a site in northern Arizona (Fule´
et al. 2002). As many managers attempt to reduce ﬁre risk
and reintroduce natural processes such as ﬁre back into the
ecosystem, our results indicate that burning should be
conducted after thinning, because several focal species
increased only after completion of both thinning and
burning treatments. However, effects on the entire avian
community should be considered prior to implementation of
forest fuel-reduction programs because the particular species
present and their abundances may affect decisions regarding
the appropriate treatment to deploy and its location, to
better meet management goals. Given the difﬁculty of
managing for many species with variable responses to forest
manipulations, creating a mosaic of forest conditions
following treatments may be the most suitable approach
for a wide range of forest passerines.
