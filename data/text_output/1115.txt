Field Notes
Ecology Group
Summer/Fall 2021
ERI ﬁeld crews notched another
successful year in 2021 and
collected data for several projects
that will provide forest managers with
highly needed information related to
ecological restoration treatments,
climate effects on ecosystems, and
new technologies for research and
monitoring. 
Forest Operations and
Biomass Utilization 
The Forest Operations and Biomass
Utilization program at ERI has been
hard at work preparing to host a
seminar this fall, doing some critical
planning work for an upcoming forest
operations workforce initiative and
continuing progress on graduate
student research projects. 
Human Dimensions 
On June 20, 2010, the Schultz Fire
was ignited by an abandoned
campﬁre and went on to burn 15,075
acres northeast of Flagstaff, Arizona.
Following the ﬁre, intense monsoon
rains over the burned area produced
ﬂooding that resulted in extensive
damage. In 2013, the ERI published
a full-cost accounting that estimated
costs for the ﬁrst three years
following the ﬁre.
Native American Forest
and Rangeland Program
San Carlos Forest Tour
ERI staff Jon Martin and Dave
Huffman made a two-day trip to the
San Carlos Apache Reservation to
tour speciﬁc project sites and assess
research potential. The tour was led
by Victoria Wesley, the newly
appointed forest manager for the
San Carlos Apache, and included
her entire staff. Ms. Wesley is an
NAU School of Forestry graduate
and a San Carlos tribal member. 
Science Delivery
This past summer, the ERI outreach
crew headed to the Santa Fe
National Forest in New Mexico to
revisit a 12-year-old restoration
demonstration site and explore the
San Juan Canyon for a rapid
assessment of pre-ﬁre exclusion
forest structure.
Testimonials
"I read the (Museum Fire survey white
paper) and it is excellent work, and the
recommendations are well crafted.”

white paper) was impressive!”

What photos can teach us about ecosystem change and
restoration
Over the years, the ERI has compiled historical-current photos and repeat
photos of before and after restoration treatments to use as visual
communication tools. Partners often requests these photos, and we are
pleased to share that they are now available on our website. Each set of photos
is taken from the same photo point, and the photos are overlaid to be
interactive—a slider tool allows you to slide back and forth from the “before” (or
historical) photo to the “after” (or present-day image).
