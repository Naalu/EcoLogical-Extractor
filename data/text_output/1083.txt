Field Notes
Ecology Group: Summer
Field Projects
In summer 2021, the ERI ﬁeld crews
will conduct measurements and
analyze data at several sites in
Arizona to evaluate understory plant
community responses to forest
restoration treatments and forest
community response to climate
warming. Crews will also travel to
New Mexico for data collection on
the Cibola and Jemez national
forests.

Utilization program at ERI focuses
on improving the overall economics
of restoration treatments through
improving operational efﬁciency and
increasing wood and biomass
utilization. This spring, ERI staff are
working on several important
projects funded through a variety of
grants.
Human Dimensions 
The use of decision support systems
(DSS), which includes a broad array
of computer-based, spatial planning
frameworks, methods, and tools, is
increasingly common in pre-wildﬁre
planning. The ERI conducted a study
on the use of these systems to
understand the barriers and
facilitators to using them and
recommendations for improving their
use.
Native American Forest
and Rangeland Program
The ERI supports the “Wood for Life”
program, which accomplishes land
management agency goals for forest
restoration, shared stewardship and
cross-boundary collaboration, and is
a practical way to heat homes.

Science Delivery
Building a Climate Adaptation
Strategy with the Forest Service
The Ecological Restoration Institute
is partnering with the US Forest
Service Southwestern Region (R3)
to help build the Regional Climate
Adaptation Strategy. Our effort builds
on the existing climate change
science in the Southwest and will
integrate with existing forest plans.
“(The ERI’s fires and soils working paper) is the most useful,
insightful, distilled, and practical manuscript of [the subject]
I’ve read in a long time. The graphics are great, the writing
style is both informative and fun, and the realistic and
unbiased approach to the topic matter is refreshing.”
– USDA Forest Service research soil microbiologist

Flagstaff Area Fires Through the Decades
Greater Flagstaff area ﬁre history map (1880–2010)
This map compiles the greater Flagstaff area ﬁre history from 1880 to present. It
delineates wildﬁres more than 100 acres through time to provide a visual story
of ﬁres in the area through the decades. For publications produced by the ERI
on wildﬁre effects, click here.
