ABSTRACT 
Changing disturbance regimes, particularly decreasing fire frequencies, may result in distributional 
changes of species across southern Appalachian landscapes. Some researchers have hypothesized that Pinus 
strobus (eastern white pine) is undergoing a change in site affinity from mesic to xeric sites in southern 
Appalachian forests, but no studies have evaluated the landscape-level status of P. strobus. We examined 
the status of P. strobus in a 225-ha old-growth Quercus landscape within the Ellicott Rock Wilderness 
(ERW) in South Carolina by sampling 80 plots. Pinus strobus exhibited the highest mean density (267 trees 
ha") of all species in the 1-10 em diameter class, with 96% of the P. strobus currently in these Quercus 
forests establishing since 1950. Density of P. strobus in the 1-10 cm diameter class was most highly 
correlated with P. strobus density>10 em diameter, and was not strongly correlated with other measured 
vegetation variables such as total Quercus basal area. Results support the hypothesis that P. strobus is 
expanding its distribution to upland sites in the southern Appalachians. It is possible that the current 
P. strobus vegetation type observed in the ERW represents a vegetation type that historically would have 
occurred more extensively had it not been inhibited by Native American or lightning-caused. fires. 
INTRODUCTION 
There is much current interest in the dynamics of southern Appalachian forests, and 
specifically in potential changes in the Quercus forests that presently occupy most of the 
southern Appalachian landscape (Bratton and Meier 1998, Harrod et al. 2000, Rhoades 2002). 
Disturbance regimes in Quercus forests of the southern Appalachians generally changed from 
frequent, low-intensity fires in the pre settlement forest to infrequent or absent fires through the 
1900s (Delcourt and Delcourt 1998, Brose et al. 2001). Current trends indicate long fire-free 
periods will persist in many areas in the 21st century, possibly resulting in shifts, expansions, 
or reductions in the distributions of individual species (Lorimer 1993, Harrod et al. 2000, 
McDonald et al. 2002). The composition and structure of future southern Appalachian forests, 
and how they may differ from current forests, is uncertain. 
A species that some researchers postulate is shifting in site affinity in the southern 
Appalachians is Pinus strobus L. (eastern white pine). White and Lloyd (1998) and Blankenship 
and Arthur (1999) hypothesized that P. strobus was confined in the pre settlement southern 
Appalachian forest to mesic sites protected from fire, but is shifting or expanding to dry, upland 
sites during the present period of infrequent fire. Pinus strobus is geographically widespread 
in the southern Appalachians, and its native range includes portions of Georgia, South Caro­
lina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia (Burns and Honkala 1990, Abrams 2001). 
Pinus strobus occurs from elevations of 370 m to a maximum of 1,220 m in the southern Appala­
chians, and habitats are typically described as north-facing slopes, coves, and stream bottoms 
(Ayres and Ashe 1905, Burns and Honkala 1990). No studies, however, have focused on the

landscape-level distribution of P. strobus in southern Appalachian forests. To help fill this 
gap in our knowledge, we undertook a study to evaluate the hypothesis of White and Lloyd 
(1998) and Blankenship and Arthur (1999) that P. strobus is undergoing a distributional change 
in the southern Appalachians. 
We examined the distributional status of P. strobus in an old-growth Quercus-dominated 
landscape in the Ellicott Rock Wilderness (ERW) of northwestern South Carolina, near the 
southwestern terminus of the native range of P. strobus (Burns and Honkala 1990). The ERW 
was selected for study because it is within the geographic and elevation range of P. strobus and 
contains large tracts of relatively undisturbed forest. This study sought to 1) determine the 
current landscape-level distribution and age structure of P. strobus in Quercus forests of the 
ERW, 2) relate the distribution of P, strobus to measured vegetation variables, and 3) assess 
potential shifts in species composition on this Quercus landscape. 
METHODS 
Study Area 
The 3,647-ha ERW occupies parts of Georgia and North and South Carolina within the 
Chattahoochee, Nantahala, and Sumter National Forests (Figure 1). This study was conducted 
in a portion of the ERW within the Sumter National Forest in Oconee County, northwestern 
South Carolina. Located in the southern section of the Blue Ridge Mountain physiographic 
province (Cooper and Hardin 1970), the ERW occupies the first chains of mountains that rise 
abruptly from the lower-elevation Piedmont region of South Carolina (DuMond 1970). 
Elevations of the highest ridges in the ERW typically range from 870-1,100 m, and topography 
consists of undulating hillslopes. Major soil taxonomic units include fine-loamy, mixed, mesic 
Typic Hapludults and fine-loamy, oxidic, mesic Typic Hapludults of the Edneytown and Evard 
series (Herren and Law 1985).

Presettlement vegetation in this region was dominated by Quercus spp. and Castanea 
dentata (Marsh.) Borkh. (American chestnut), with the ERW lying in the extreme southern 
section of the oak-chestnut forest region of Braun (1950). Dominant understory plants in these 
forests include Vaccinium pallidum Ait. (low-bush blueberry), Gaylussacia ursina (M.A. Curtis) 
Torr. & Gray ex Gray (bear huckleberry), Kalmia latifolia 1. (mountain laurel), and Quercus 
seedlings (DuMond 1970). Forests dominated by Tsuga canadensis (1.) Carr. (eastern hemlock) 
and other non-Quercus species form comparatively minor inclusions along riparian areas in the 
predominant Quercus matrix (Braun 1950, DuMond 1970). With the exception of the chestnut 
blight (Keever 1953), major disturbance throughout the ERW has been minimal since the early 
1900s. Several sections of the ERW have been identified as old-growth forest with canopy 
dominants greater than age 100 yr during Forest Service surveys for old growth in the region 
(Carlson 1995). 
Field Procedures 
We studied a 225-ha portion of the ERW near the Sloan Bridge Trail (35°00'20"N, 
83°04'15"W) mapped by Carlson (1995) as old growth and consisting of relatively undisturbed 
forest. We sampled species composition in upland Quercus forests in the 225-ha landscape by 
establishing 80, 0.03-ha square plots using a stratified-random design (Green 1979). This design 
consisted of 80 areal strata each ca. 2.8 ha in size. Upland Quercus forests were defined as 
hillslopes dominated by one or more species of Quercus, and these forests in the ERW are similar 
to the xeric oak/blueberry, xeric chestnut oak/mountain laurel, and submesic oak/mixed flora 
ecosystems described in detail in Abella (2002) for a landscape adjacent to the ERW. We located 
one plot in each stratum, with plots serving as independent sampling units across the landscape 
(Hurlbert 1984). On each plot, we determined the species and measured the diameter to the 
nearest cm at 1.4 m for each tree greater than 1 em diameter. We counted all P. strobus 
seedlings and saplings less than 1 em diameter on the plots, and we aged P. strobus by counting 
branch whorls (Rhoades 2002). Whorl counts represent ages at the time of sampling in February 
and March 2002. Nomenclature follows Kartesz (1999). 
Statistical Analyses 
We calculated summary statistics on a plot basis for each species including frequency and 
mean basal area, density, and diameter. We constructed diameter distributions and compared 
mean densities among species within each diameter class using Friedman tests (Conover 1999). 
Friedinan tests are nonparametric tests for paired observations, with plots treated as blocks 
and the species on each plot serving as paired observations (Conover 1999). When the null 
hypothesis of no difference in density among species in a diameter class was rejected, the 
multiple comparison procedure documented in Conover (1999) was used for mean separation. 
We compared overall species composition between diameter classes corresponding to understory 
(1-10 cm diameter), midstory (10-20 em diameter) and overstory strata (>20 em diameter) 
using pairwise blocked multi-response permutation procedure tests (McCune and Mefford 
1999). Multi-response permutation procedures are multivariate, nonparametric tests that 
evaluate the null hypothesis of no difference in species composition between groups using 
a randomization procedure. Blocked tests (Euclidean distance and medians aligned) were used 
since species on each plot were paired observations (McCune and Mefford 1999). We conducted 
separate tests using both quantitative (relative density) and qualitative (presence/absence) 
data. To account for exclusive understory species such as Comus florida L. (flowering dogwood) 
that rarely reach large diameter classes (Rhoades 2002), we ran tests both with and without 
exclusive understory species included. Results did not change based on the inclusion or 
exclusion of exclusive understory species, and we report results based on the full species 
composition. 
We grouped P. strobus on plots into lO-year age classes and compared the proportion of 
trees in each age class using pairwise chi-squared tests. To examine vegetation structural vari­
ables that may impact P. strobus regeneration, we used Spearman rank coefficients (two-tailed

tests) to correlate P. strobus density in the 1-10 em diameter class with other vegetation  
variables including Quercus basal area andP. strobus density greater than 10 cm diameter. We  
classified the 80 plots, partitioned into understory (1-10 cm diameter) and overstory (>20 em  
diameter) strata for separate classifications, using two-way indicator species analysis  
(TWINSPAN) in PC-ORD (McCune and Mefford 1999). Importance values (average of relative  
density and relative basal area) were used for this analysis with nine pseudospecies cut levels  
(0,2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60). The objective of the TWINSPAN classification was to iden­ 
tify associations of P. strobus with other combinations of species. We tested the validity of  
TWINSPAN divisions using indicator species analysis (Dufrene and Legendre 1997) as  
incorporated into PC-ORD (McCune and Mefford 1999). Indicator values range from 0 (no  
indication) to 100 (perfect indication), and significance of the maximum indicator value of each  
species was evaluated using a Monte Carlo test.  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Forest Composition and Structure 
Quercus spp. (Q. alba L., Q. coccinea Muenchh., Q. prinus L., Q. rubra L., and Q. velutina 
Lam.) comprised 20.7 m2 (56%) of the 37 m 2 ha-1 mean basal area of the upland forests of the 
study area (Table 1), consistent with the inclusion of the ERW in the oak-chestnut forest region 
(Braun 1950). Liriodendron tulipifera L. (tulip-poplar), Carya glabra (P. Mill.) Sweet (pignut 
hickory), C. alba (L.) Nutt. ex Ell. (mockernut hickory), and Pinus strobus were occasional 
canopy dominants with Quercus (Table 1). Acer rubrum L. (red maple), P. strobus, Oxydendrum 
arboreum (L.) DC. (sourwood), and Nyssa sylvatica Marsh. (blackgum) were the most frequently 
occurring species, with frequencies exceeding 80%. 
Only after diameter classes exceeded 30 em did Quercus comprise greater than 50% 
relative density (Figure 2), supporting previous research that has documented a widespread 
lack of Quercus regeneration (Lorimer 1993, McDonald et al. 2002). Pinus strobus exhibited the 
highest mean density (267 trees ha-1) of all species in the 1-10 em diameter class. This density

did not differ significantly from A. rubrum density and was significantly higher than N. 
sylvatica and L. tulipifera density (Figure 2). Previous studies in other areas of the southern 
Appalachians have found that species such as A. rubrum and L. tulipifera, rather than P. 
strobus, dominate the understories of Quercus forests (Elliott et al. 1999). However, Harrod 
et al. (2000) reported P. strobus densities (0.5-10 em diameter) of 326 trees ha"! based on seven 
plots in xeric Quercus forests in the western Smoky Mountains in Tennessee, while Blankenship 
and Arthur (1999) reported P. strobus densities (2-10 cm diameter) ranging from 72-550 trees 
ha-l for three Quercus sites in eastern Kentucky. Additional research is needed to clarify the 
geographic extent of P. strobus regeneration in Quercus forests within its range in the southern 
Appalachians. Because the native range of P. strobus ends in all directions except north 
surrounding the ERW (Burns and Honkala 1990), establishment ofP. strobus in Quercus forests 
of the ERW appears relatively unique in this portion of the southern Appalachians. 
Pinus strobus Age Structure 
Pinus strobus exhibited an all-aged distribution, both within and among plots (Figure 3). 
More than 96% of the P. strobus currently in these Quercus forests established since 1950, and 
all P. strobus in our sample established during or after the early 1900s (Figure 3). Based on ages 
of greater than 100 years and commonly above 200 years for dominant overstory Quercus in 
these forests reported by Carlson (1995), existing P. strobus are younger than the predominant 
Quercus overstory. Pinus strobus has established continuously in these Quercus forests since 
the early 1900s, a time period during which there is no known history of major disturbance since 
the chestnut blight (Carlson 1995). It is possible, however, that canopy openings created by the 
chestnut blight, windthrow, or other similar disturbances facilitated the initial establishment of 
P. strobus in these forests in the early 1900s. Pinus strobus is susceptible to fire damage when 
young (Burns and Honkala 1990, Blankenship and Arthur 1999, Harrod et al, 2000), and the

lack of fire during the 1900s probably allowed the initial cohort of establishing P. strobus and 
their subsequent seedlings to survive (Figure 3). 
Relations of Pinus strobus Regeneration to Vegetation Structure 
Pinus strobus density in the 1-10 em diameter class was most highly correlated with P. 
strobus density greater than 10 em diameter, suggesting P. strobus regeneration in these 
Quercus forests is partly associated with local P. strobus seed availability (Table 2). Pinus 
strobus begins producing seed at age 25-35 yr (Burns and Honkala 1990), and P. strobus 
establishing in the Quercus matrix in the early and mid-1900s probably have been seed sources 
for more recent P. strobus establishment in these Quercus forests (Clark et al. 1998). Quercus 
coccinea basal area and N. sylvatica and L. tulipifera density were significantly although weakly 
correlated with P. strobus regeneration, but no other measured vegetation variables were 
significantly correlated with P. strobus regeneration (Table 2). Neither total mean Quercus 
basal area, density, or mean Quercus diameter were associated with P. strobus regeneration. 
These results suggest P. strobus regeneration across the landscape is associated partly with the 
distribution of P. strobus seed sources, but regeneration is not related to the density of the 
predominant Quercus overstory and is weakly or not significantly associated with densities of 
other understory species. 
TWINSPAN broadly divided the overstories of the plots into Q. prinus and Q. alba forests, 
with subsequent divisions based on combinations of several Quercus species and P. strobus and 
L. tulipifera (Figure 4). Understories were divided into forests with P. strobus most dominant, 
and forests with abundant Halesia tetraptera Ellis (silverbell) and L. tulipifera, These results 
are consistent with the weak negative correlations of P. strobus with H. tetraptera and L. 
tulipifera densities (Table 2). Ecological reasons for these correlations are unclear, but they 
may be related to differences in site and soil preferences of the species. The high frequencies 
of P. strobus and A. rubrum (Table 1) served to homogenize the understory, making fewer 
divisions possible for the understory strata than for the Quercus-dominated overstory strata 
(Figure 4).

Shifts in Species Composition 
Blocked multi-response permutation procedure tests indicated overall species composition 
differed significantly among understory, midstory, and overstory strata regardless of whether or 
not exclusive understory trees (e.g., C. florida) were included in analyses (Table 3). These 
results reflect Quercus overstory dominance and P. strobus, A. rubrum, and N. sylvatica 
understory dominance (Figure 2). These findings are suggestive of an eventual replacement of 
Quercus by P. strobus, although the ability of P. strobus to persist as a long-lived (>100 yr) 
dominant in the overstories of these uplands sites, where P. strobus has not previously typically 
occurred, is uncertain (Hibbs 1982). 
Pinus strobus as a Xeric or Mesic Species in Southern Appalachian Forests 
Results of this study support the hypothesis that P. strobus has undergone a distributional 
change from its presettlement mesic-site restriction by expanding to xeric Quercus sites during 
the present period of infrequent fires (White and Lloyd 1998, Blankenship and Arthur 1999). 
Determining the mechanism and seed sources for this distributional change is difficult. 
Riparian forests not dominated by Quercus where P. strobus may have been confined in the 
presettlement forest are of limited areal extent in the ERW (DuMond 1970). It remains 
uncertain if P. strobus in these small riparian areas supplied seed sources for the initial 
expansion of the species to xeric Quercus uplands in the early 1900s, or if seed was supplied 
by other means (Clark et al. 1998). Pinus strobus plantations «1 ha in size) in a Quercus 
landscape served as seed sources for widespread P. strobus establishment in Quercus forests in 
northwest Ohio (Abella and MacDonald 2002), suggesting it is possible P. strobus in the ERW 
expanded from seed sources from limited riparian forests. Future research in the ERW could 
survey for and map riparian forests that contain P. strobus and examine their age structure and 
proximity to upland Quercus forests that contain understory P. strobus. These data may provide 
insights into the spatial and temporal patterns of the distributional expansion of P. strobus from 
mesic to xeric sites that has occurred on this landscape during the 1900s. 
Reasons for the apparent confinement of P. strobus to mesic areas in the presettlement 
southern Appalachian forest deserve attention. While it is well established that fires were 
historically more frequent in dry southern Appalachian Quercus forests than at present, the 
historical relative importance of Native American and lightning fires is still debated and 
may have varied greatly within the southern Appalachian region (Bratton and Meier 1998, Del­
court and Delcourt 1998, Yarnell 1998). Bratton and Meier (1998), for example, reported low

and impacts, however, were not uniform across the southern Appalachians, and it is unclear 
how frequently, if at all, an area would be burned by Native Americans (Yarnell 1998). Likewise, 
lightning-caused fires may have been relatively rare, but it is unclear how the size of areas 
burned by lightning fires compared to that of Native American fires. Small P. strobus have thin 
bark susceptible to fire damage, and contemporary experiments suggest P. strobus could not 
have remained established in areas that burned more frequently than about every 20-30 yr 
(Blankenship and Arthur 1999, Harrod et a1. 2000). It is possible that the current P. strobus 
vegetation type observed on xeric sites in the ERW represents a vegetation type that would have 
historically occurred more extensively had Native American burning not increased fire 
frequencies above those typical of lightning ignitions. 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
We examined the distribution of Pinus strobus in upland Quercus forests in an old-growth 
southern Appalachian landscape in South Carolina by sampling 80, 0.03-ha plots. Pinus strobus 
exhibited a frequency of95% and had the highest mean density (267 trees ha") of all species in 
the 1-10 em diameter class. Pinus strobus regeneration was most highly correlated with 
P. strobus density > 10 cm diameter, but was not strongly correlated with other measured 
vegetation variables. Results support the hypothesis that P. strobus is undergoing a distribu­
tional expansion to upland Quercus forests within its range in the southern Appalachians, but 
the mechanism of this distributional change that began in the early 1900s in the ERW is 
uncertain. Additional research to better understand the distributional dynamics of P. strobus 
during the 1900s is needed, and may provide insights for predicting future change in southern 
Appalachian Quercus forests within the native range of P. strobus. Research on current age 
structures or reconstructions of past P. strobus age structures on mesic sites, where P. strobus 
was historically confined and that may have provided seed sources, could help explain the 
expansion of P. strobus to dry Quercus sites in the early 1900s. Studying the local environments, 
through reconstruction, in which existing large P. strobus established in the Quercus matrix in 
the early 1900s may help determine whether canopy gaps caused by the chestnut blight initially 
facilitated P. strobus establishment. Research also is needed to monitor ecosystem changes, such
