ABSTRACT 
INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE AND LOCAL FACTORS ON FIRE 
IN HIGH-ELEV A nON FORESTS OF MEXICO 
LARISSA YOCOM 
Factors that affect fire occurrence operate on a continuum of scale, from fine-
scale microsite variation in topography, fuels, ignitions, and weather to broad-scale 
global climate oscillations. Fine-scale factors interrupt fire synchrony across landscapes, 
while broad-scale factors synchronize fire across landscapes and even continents. This 
dissertation assesses the influence of fine-scale and broad-scale factors on fire occurrence 
in eastern and northern Mexico. 
At Pena Nevada in northeastern Mexico, a temporal change occurred in the 
association between the broad-scale climatic factor EI Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 
and fires; before the 1830s La Nina events were significantly associated with fire years, 
while after the 1830s this association was not significant. This result suggests that ENSO 
effects have changed over time in this location and that phases of ENSO are not 
consistent indicators of precipitation, fire occurrence, or fire behavior in this part of 
Mexico. 
At the northern end of the Sierra Madre Oriental in northeastern Mexico, three 
parallel mountain ranges were chosen to distinguish the influence of broad-scale vs. fine-
scale factors. The mountain ranges received nearly identical broad-scale climatic

influence, but spread of fire between the ranges was unlikely. Broad-scale control would 
be indicated by high fire synchrony among mountains while fine-scale control would be 
indicated by asynchrony in fire occurrence. Fires were asynchronous among mountains, 
indicating a strong influence of fine-scale factors on fire occurrence. 
In southeastern Mexico, Pico de Orizaba is North America's third-tallest peak. In 
1975, researchers reported that increased human-caused burning was degrading the 
forests in this location. We investigated the fire regime and forest structure in this area 
and found that in the twentieth century a fire was recorded in at least one of six sites in 90 
of 100 years; this very frequent surface fire regime consisted of mostly small and 
asynchronous fires. Inter-annual climatic variability was not an influential driver of fire, 
and no evidence of forest degradation was found in the research plots. A trend in the 21 5t 
century toward decreased fire could be cause for concern, as this could lead to an increase 
in tree density and a loss of resilience in the face of climate change and other future 
disturbance. 
Finally, the influence of climate on the occurrence of fire across northern Mexico 
was assessed using a network of 52 sites in 5 regions in the Sierra San Pedro Martir, the 
Sierra Madre Occidental, and the Sierra Madre Oriental. Across-region synchronous fires 
in northern Mexico were significantly associated with negative (La Nina) phases of 
ENSO and cool phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Although climate was a 
strong driver of fires historically and through the twentieth century at some sites, dates of 
fire regime interruption across northern Mexico were highly variable within and among 
regions. This result suggests that human land use change is the strong driver of fire

regime interruption, and climate played little or no role in the widespread cessation of fire 
across much of western North America in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. 
In summary, this dissertation showed that both broad-scale and fine-scale factors 
influenced the occurrence of fire in eastern and northern Mexico, and many factors that 
affect fire occurrence cannot be disentangled. Understanding the historical influence of 
climate variability on fire occurrence may help us understand how future climate change 
will affect fire activity in western North America.

PREFACE 
This dissertation has been prepared in journal format. Consequently, there is some 
redundancy among the chapters. Chapter 2 is entitled "El Nino-Southern Oscillation 
effect on a fire regime in northeastern Mexico has changed over time" and was published 
in Ecology in 2010. Chapters 3 through 5 will be submitted to journals for publication in 
the coming months. Because each chapter has been or will be published with co-authors, 
the pronoun "we" is used throughout the dissertation.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 
Factors that affect fire occurrence operate on a continuum of scale, from fine-scale 
microsite variation in topography, fuels, ignitions, and weather to broad-scale global 
climate oscillations. Fine-scale factors interrupt fire synchrony across landscapes, while 
broad-scale factors synchronize fire across landscapes and even continents. This 
dissertation is focused on the fine-scale and broad-scale factors that influence fire 
occurrence in eastern and northern Mexico. 
The occurrence of synchronous, large wildfires over large areas of the western 
United States has been linked with large-scale climatic oscillations such as the EI Nifio-
Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However, local factors such as fuel availability, ignitions, 
and topography influence the occurrence of fire as well. For example, ignitions, both 
natural and human, vary over space and time with probability of lightning strikes, 
proximity to human settlements, and variation in human land and fire use. Understanding 
the relative influence of broad-scale and fine-scale factors and at what scale they operate 
is important not only for our understanding of major ecological processes, but also for 
management reasons. For example, prescribed burning and thinning, which are practices 
designed to reduce fuel and therefore the risk of catastrophic fire, may be of little value if 
regional climate is the main determinant of widespread fire. In addition, a better 
understanding of how climate influences the occurrence of wildfire will help us look 
toward the future in an era of global climate change. 
In the United States, several studies have linked climate and fire at the regional 
level. However, the large influence that humans have had on fire in the twentieth century

through fire suppression, timber extraction, and livestock grazing make the patterns 
linking climate and fire difficult to assess in the past several decades. In Mexico, less is 
known about how climate affects fire. Mexico offers a unique opportunity to study the 
relationship between climate and fire in recent years since sites exist where fire regimes 
have not been completely interrupted by human land use, timber cutting, or fire 
suppression. 
The first theme addressed in the dissertation is change in a climate driver of fire 
occurrence over time. Before the 1830s at Pena Nevada in eastern Mexico, La Nina 
events were significantly associated with fire occurrence. After the 1830s, neither La 
Nina nor EI Nino was associated with fire and in recent decades, both extreme La Nina 
and extreme EI Nino events, such as the extreme EI Nino of 1998, have been associated 
with fire occurrence. 
The next chapter was designed to test broad-scale and fine-scale influences on fire 
in a region of eastern Mexico. This chapter is focused on synchrony among mountain 
ranges that receive the same meso-scale climatic inputs due to their close proximity to 
each other. However, fires would be unlikely to spread between these mountain ranges 
because of the unique topography in the area, consisting of high mountain peaks 
separated by deep valleys. Fire synchrony among the three mountains was very low, and 
suggests that fine-scale factors are important in driving fire occurrence at this scale. Fine-
scale factors that are likely important in this region include topography, ignitions, 
dominant tree species, and human land use; these fine-scale factors are inter-related. 
The fourth chapter focuses on a site in central Mexico with very frequent fire and 
little influence from inter-annual climatic variability. This chapter describes the fire

regime of a timberline forest in central Mexico, and is the first fire history study in the 
region of Mexico where EI Nino events are typically associated with below-average 
precipitation. Fire in the study area was very frequent over the past century, but fires 
were unassociated with ENSO events. This area has most likely been heavily influenced 
by human-caused fire, but little or no degradation of the forest has occurred over the past 
century and the forest is well adapted to very frequent, patchy surface fires. 
The fifth chapter has the broadest focus and includes data from across northern 
Mexico. Data from over 50 sites across northern Mexico were used to analyze the effects 
of EN SO, PD~, and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) on historical synchrony 
and asynchrony of fire. Synchronous fires tended to occur during negative phases of 
ENSO, PD~, and the combination of these two phases, but AMO was not significantly 
related to synchronous fire occurrence. 
This research substantially expands the continental-scale network of 
fire/climate/forest structure sites, adds to our understanding ofthe regulatory factors of 
fire regimes, and has immediate utility for conservation strategies at the study areas and 
related ecosystems. This is a unique study in that it covers a very broad scale in areas 
where fire history studies are limited or nonexistent. By working in areas of great 
biological diversity and conservation potential, these studies will form a starting point for 
future multi-disciplinary research and will be of practical value to conservation 
organizations that are seeking to maintain or restore these ecosystems.

CHAPTER 2: EL NINO-SOUTHERN OSCILLATION EFFECT ON A FIRE 
REGIME IN NORTHEASTERN MEXICO HAS CHANGED OVER TIME 
Abstract 
The EI Nino Southern-Oscillation (ENSO) is a climate-forcing mechanism that has been 
shown to affect precipitation and the occurrence of wildfires in many parts of the world. 
In the southern United States and northern Mexico, warm events (EI Nino) are associated 
with moist winter conditions and fewer fires, while cool events (La Nina) tend to favor 
dry winters and more fires. We tested this relationship in a region of northeastern Mexico 
by characterizing the historical fire regime and climatic influences. Fire regimes were 
reconstructed from fire-scar samples collected from 100 trees in three high-elevation sites 
on Pena Nevada in southern Coahuila. The sites were approximately 25 ha each and the 
site centers were approximately 1 Ian apart. The earliest recorded fire occurred in 1521 
and the time period we used for analysis was 1645-1929. The sites were characterized by 
frequent surface fires before the 1920s. In the three sites, mean fire intervals ranged from 
8.6 to 9.6 years (all fires) and 11.9 to 18.6 years (fires that scarred ~25% of recording 
trees). The per-tree mean fire return interval was 17 years, and all three sites burned in 
the same year seven times between 1774 and 1929. After 1929, fires were nearly 
eliminated in all sites, likely due to human causes. We found a temporal change in the 
association between ENSO events and fires; before the 1830s La Nina events were 
significantly associated with fire years, while after the 1830s this association was not 
significant. In 1998 - when the most severe EI Nino event of the past century occurred-
the three sites experienced severe, stand-replacing fires that killed many trees that had

survived multiple surface fires in the past. Prior to the 1830s, fires tended to occur during 
dry La Nina years, but since then both La Nina and El Nino have been associated with 
dry years in this region, especially during the last three decades. This result suggests that 
ENSO effects have changed over time in this location and that phases of ENSO are not 
consistent indicators of precipitation, fire occurrence, or fire behavior in this area of 
northeastern Mexico. 
Introduction 
In western North America, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a climate-
forcing mechanism that has been shown to affect precipitation and the occurrence of 
fires. Linkages between ENSO and the occurrence of forest fires have been recognized at 
scales ranging from local and regional (Swetnam 1990, Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003, 
Brown and Wu 2005, FuIe et al. 2005, Skinner et al. 2008) to subcontinental and 
intercontinental (Kitzberger et al. 2001, Kitzberger et al. 2007). La Nina winters (ENSO 
cool phase) in northwestern Mexico are typically hot and dry, as they are in the American 
Southwest, and fires are more likely to burn during these years (Swetnam and Betancourt 
1990, Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003, Fule et al. 2005, Kitzberger et al. 2007, Skinner et 
al. 2008). In southern Mexico, however, El Nino winters (ENSO warm phase) are dry and 
fire-prone (Magana et al. 2003, Roman-Cuesta et al. 2004, Seager et al. 2009). 
The extreme El Nino event of 1998 was associated with a widespread drought and 
severe forest fires in Mexico. It was an unprecedented year for Mexico in terms of 
number of fires, area and biomass burned, smoke released, cost of suppression, and 
firefighter lives lost (Rodriguez-Trejo and Pyne 1999, Duncan et al. 2003). Most of the 
fires were located in the southern part of the country (Rodriguez-Trejo and Pyne 1999),

where EI Nino typically induces drought. However, severe fires also burned farther north 
in Mexico, in the Sierra Madre Oriental. 
The Sierra Madre Oriental, in eastern Mexico, is located on or near the dipole 
where ENSO events have reverse effects; it is situated between areas where La Nina is 
associated with dry conditions (northwestern Mexico), and areas where EI Nino is 
associated with dry conditions (southern Mexico) (Caso et al. 2007, Seager et al. 2009). 
Because of its geographical location on or near the ENSO dipole, it is unknown whether 
wann or cool phases of the oscillation are more likely to be associated with fire 
occurrence in this area. Severe fires burned in the Sierra Madre Oriental during the 1998 
EI Nino event, but the 1998 EI Nino was extremely strong and therefore may have had 
atypical effects on fires in this region. 
The types of fire behavior that occur in high-elevation forests of the Sierra Madre 
Oriental are also unknown. Severe fires in 1998 devastated many stands of trees, but this 
level of severity may have been an anomaly compared to the historical fire regime. Pinus 
hartwegii (Lindl.), a dominant tree species at high elevation in the Sierra Madre Oriental 
and elsewhere in Mexico and Guatemala (Farjon and Styles 1997), has several 
adaptations to fire, including thick bark and the ability to resprout after fire (Rodriguez-
Trejo and Ful6 2003). While thick bark is usually considered an adaptation to surface fire, 
sprouting sometimes occurs in trees adapted to intense crown fire (Keeley and Zedler 
1998). Although there have been several studies of P. hartwegii fire ecology, this is the 
first fire history study in a P. hartwegii forest and the first long-term fire history study in 
the Sierra Madre Oriental. Gonzalez et al. (2007) reconstructed fire history of a pine-oak 
forest (P. teocote, P. pseudostrobus) in the northern Sierra Madre Oriental but their tree-

ring record reached back only to 1868. Fire history studies in northwestern Mexico, in the 
Sierra Madre Occidental (Fule and Covington 1994, Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003), and 
in the Sierra San Pedro Martir (Stephens et al. 2003) indicate that fires occurred 
frequently in the past and that fire regimes continued uninterrupted well into the 20th 
century. The Sierra Madre Oriental contains high biodiversity, including 59 endemic 
plant species that inhabit less than 6 km2 each (McDonald 1993). At least 35% of 
timberline plant species in the range are endemic to the Sierra Madre Oriental (McDonald 
1990). Pefia Nevada, the location of our study, has 10 plant species endemic to the peak 
alone (McDonald 1993). We selected Pefia Nevada to quantify long-term fire regimes 
because of its critical location in a transition zone of ENSO effects as well as the high 
conservation value of this rare ecosystem. 
The objectives of this study were 1) to characterize the historical fire regime in 
the P. hartwegii forests ofPefia Nevada, including fire frequency, type, size, season, and 
synchrony, and 2) to determine whether fire years were associated with ENSO. Specific 
questions included: What were the characteristics of the fire regime? Was the fire regime 
interrupted in the twentieth century? What are the effects of ENSO on fires in this region 
of Mexico? Were the fires in the 1998 El Nifio an anomaly? 
Study area 
Pefia Nevada, at 3540 m elevation, is located in the Sierra Madre Oriental in the 
state of Nuevo Leon, Mexico (Fig. 2.1). We focused on Pefia Nevada (also called El 
Picacho San Onofre) primarily for biogeographical reasons: it is the southernmost peak in 
the high, consolidated part of the Sierra Madre Oriental that runs from just south of 
Monterrey to southern Nuevo Leon and southwestern Tamaulipas, and it is located

between areas where ENSO events have opposite effects. We chose specific sites on the 
mountain because of their history of relatively light anthropogenic disturbance prior to 
the 1998 fire, the presence of P. hartwegii forests, which were least anthropogenic ally 
disturbed at the highest elevations, and the presence of old trees or old remnant wood. In 
addition, the sites were spaced along a broad ridgeline which would allow them to 
capture evidence of fires spreading up either side of the mountain. 
The study area is located at approximately 3200 m above sea level. Climate data 
from lower-elevation weather stations to the southeast and southwest of Pen a Nevada 
(Uvalles, 1565 m, and San Antonio Pena Nevada, 1680 m) averaged annual precipitation 
of335 mm, with peaks in late spring and late summer (lMTA 2007). The precipitation at 
sites over 2800 m in the Sierra Madre Oriental is estimated to be 450-500 mm annually 
(Villanueva-Diaz et al. 2007), but the percentage of precipitation that falls as snow is 
unknown. Average yearly temperature at the two lower-elevation stations is 10.8° C 
(lMT A 2007), but the average yearly temperature at our study sites is certainly lower. 
The majority of lightning storms in the area occur in the spring (lMTA 2007). Exposed 
rock in the Sierra Madre Oriental is limestone (Ferrusquia-Villafranca 1993). 
The sites we sampled are dominated almost exclusively by P. hartwegii. After the 
severe fire in 1998, some parts of Pena Nevada experienced high tree mortality and were 
later salvage logged. Because of this, much of the area we sampled was essentially clear-
cut, with some pockets of intact forest. 
In 1984, Andrew McDonald witnessed and took a photo of a recently burned area 
in a remote area on Pena Nevada, not near our sampling sites (personal communication 
2009). The photo shows that some of the forest burned severely; only charred snags are

left in the burned area. It is likely that the severe fire happened in 1983; the needles on 
the trees at the edge of the bum were orange but had not yet fallen by 1984. The year 
1983 was dry at Pefia Nevada, which also lends credence to the 1983 date. 
Methods 
We collected fire-scarred tree samples at Pefia Nevada in 2007. We established 
three sites of approximately 25 ha each at San Onofre (SO), EI Diferencial (DI), and 
Mesa Acufia (MA) (Fig. 2.1). The sites were spaced approximately 1 km apart and had 
comparable elevation and vegetation. All had moderate slopes, situated on top of a broad 
ridgeline. We systematically searched each site and took fire-scarred samples that would 
provide good spatial distribution throughout the site. We chose to sample trees of any 
species with the largest numbers of well-preserved fire scars (Van Home and Fule 2006), 
but we also sampled live trees, which often had only one or two scars, to ensure that the 
fire history extended up to the present. We used chain saws to remove partial cross-
sections of fire-scarred trees. Data recorded for each sample were tree species and 
diameter, status (live, stump, snag, or log), slope, aspect, and fire scar height and aspect. 
We georeferenced each sample to map the spatial distribution of the samples. 
In the laboratory, samples were sanded with increasingly finer grits of sandpaper 
until individual cells were clearly visible under a microscope. We crossdated each sample 
using a Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco tree-ring chronology from nearby on Pefia 
Nevada (Villanueva-Diaz et al. 2007). The crossdating of each sample was confirmed by 
a second dendrochronologist. We measured the ring widths of each sample and checked 
the crossdating with the COFECHA software program (Holmes 1983).

We identified fire scars to the year of origin by noting the crossdated ring in 
which the fire injury occurred (Baisan and Swetnam 1990). When possible, fire scars 
were determined to be located in the early earlywood (EE), middle earlywood (ME), late 
earlywood (LE), latewood (L), or on the boundary between rings (indicating a dormant 
(D) season fire). We assigned dormant season fires to the subsequent calendar year 
because most fires in monsoonal systems such as this one burn prior to the summer rains. 
We grouped fires into spring (D + EE) and summer (ME + LE + L) categories for 
seasonal evaluation. 
Fire history statistics were calculated for periods in which there was an adequate 
tree-ring record. Each site was determined to have an adequate tree-ring record when at 
least 10% of total samples in that site were scarred. The same criterion was used when 
calculating statistics for the three sites combined. In the three sites combined, the period 
with an adequate tree-ring record was 1645-1929. Each site individually had an adequate 
tree-ring record from 1641 to 1920 (SO), 1645-1929 (DI), and 1774-1928 (MA). 
Fire history statistics were calculated with FHX2 v. 3.2 software (Grissino-Mayer 
2001). For each site and for all three sites combined, we calculated the composite mean 
fire interval between all fires and also between more widespread fires that scarred at least 
25% of recording trees. Recording trees are trees that have been scarred by fire once; 
after an initial wound, trees of some species are more likely to scar in subsequent fires 
(Romme 1980) and therefore are "recording trees". We calculated Weibull median and 
modal fire intervals, and looked for temporal differences in mean fire interval, seasonality 
of fires, and fire relationship with precipitation and ENSO between the first portion of the 
period of analysis (1645-1831) and the second portion (1832-1929). We split the analysis

at 183111832 not a priori but because one of our results, a graph of EN SO extremes and 
precipitation at Peiia Nevada, showed an unexpected change in relationship around that 
time. We also examined the fire history at Peiia Nevada for evidence of a hiatus in fire 
occurrence that would coincide with a late eighteenth-early nineteenth centuries gap in 
fire documented at many sites in the southwestern United States and northwestern 
Mexico (Swetnam 1990, Kitzberger et al. 2001, Stephens et al. 2003, Brown and Wu 
2005, Skinner et al. 2008). 
To evaluate climate conditions related to fire occurrence at our study sites, we 
used superposed epoch analysis (SEA) in FHX2 v. 3.2 (Baisan and Swetnam 1990, 
Swetnam 1993, Grissino-Mayer 2001) to compare independently-derived indices of 
ENSO and precipitation during fire years, for five years prior to fire years, and for two 
years after fire years. Reconstructions used include a reconstruction of winter ENSO 
(NIN03, Dec. to Feb., 1408-1978, Cook 2000), and a local precipitation reconstruction 
(Villanueva-Diaz et al. 2007). The time series of precipitation had no temporal 
autocorrelation, but the NIN03 index did. To address the temporal autocorrelation in the 
NIN03 index, we fitted autoregressive integrated moving average models based on 
lowest Akaike's information criterion and significant but uncorrelated parameter 
estimates (Brown et aI. 2008). We used the white noise residuals in our analyses. To 
assess statistical significance in the SEA analyses, confidence intervals (95%) were 
calculated using bootstrapped distributions of climate data in 1000 trials. We compared 
ENSO and precipitation indices with the occurrence of all fires regardless of size, as well 
as widespread fires that scarred at least 25% of recording trees in all three sites. We 
completed these analyses for the entire period with an adequate tree-ring record (1645-

1929) and also for the first part of this period alone (1645-1831) and the second part 
alone (1832-1929). 
We plotted extreme ENSO events on a local precipitation reconstruction based on 
P. menziesii annual rings (Villanueva-Diaz et al. 2007). Extreme winter SOl values were 
identified between 1699 and 1971 by Stahle and Cleaveland (1993), using tree-ring 
records from Mexico and the United States. Stahle and Cleaveland used two methods to 
reconstruct extreme SOl values, regression and classification, and considered the most 
accurate list of extremes to be a list of years when both methods obtained the same results 
for extreme winter SOl values. This is the list we used. After 1971, we determined 
extreme winter SOl values to be December-January-February (DJF) average values (SOl 
data from NCAR's Climate Analysis Section Data Catalog: 
http://www.cgd.ucar.edulcas/catalog/climind/) that were more than 1.5 standard 
deviations from the average DJF values from 1935 to 2006. Using this method, extreme 
winter SOl values after 1971 were in 1974 and 1976 (La Nina events), and 1983, 1992, 
and 1998 (El Nino events). 
Results 
Fire history 
We collected a total of 112 samples: 34 in SO, 48 in Dl, and 30 in MA. The 
majority of samples were taken from stumps and all but one of the samples was from P. 
hartwegii; the exception came from a single P. menziesii. We were able to crossdate 100 
of the samples (89%) and we identified 408 scars in total. We were unable to date 12 
samples (11 %) because of rotten wood, rings that were too tight, or an insufficient 
number of rings to permit reliable crossdating.

The earliest fire scar identified in our three sites occurred in 1521, and the last fire 
scars were from 1998, the year that much of the forest in our sites burned severely. Until 
the late 1920s, the fire regime at Pefia Nevada showed relatively little variability across 
sites and through time (Fig. 2.2). The mean fire interval for all fires was within one year's 
difference between sites (SO: 9.3 years, DI: 8.6 years, MA: 9.6 years; Table 2.1). The 
mean fire interval for more widespread fires (those that burned ~ 25% of the trees) was 
longer, and varied from 11.9 years in MA to 18.6 years in SO (Table 2.1). The Weibull 
distribution, which has been used in describing fire regimes because it is flexible, able to 
fit skewed data sets, and provides a standard way to compare fire regimes across 
ecological gradients (Grissino-Mayer 1999), fit our data well. Weibull median probability 
interval values were similar to mean fire interval values (Table 2.1). The mean fire 
interval for individual trees was 17 years. There were no statistically significant temporal 
differences in mean fire interval or percent of samples scarred between 1645-1831 and 
1832-1929. 
Two of the three sites (SO and DI) have a continuous record starting in the early 
1500s and large numbers of samples starting in the 1600s. Site MA is the only site that 
does not have a continuous record that precedes the early 1700s. Two samples were 
found in MA that span the mid-1500s to the mid-1600s, but there is a gap in sample 
coverage between the mid-1600s and the early 1700s. MA did have one pulse of 
regeneration in the early 1700s; 7 out of 9 pith dates in that site were from between 1726 
and 1742. Sites SO and DI had 18 samples that contained pith; pith dates were scattered 
from 1589 to 1892 with no pulse of regeneration evident at any time in either site.

Between 1774 and 1929, out of 38 years with fires, seven years (18%) had fires 
recorded at all three sites (SO,DI,andMA): 1786, 1819, 1831, 1838, 1899, 1909, and 
1920. Twenty-two fire dates (58%) were unique to one site only and 9 fire dates (24%) 
were recorded at two sites. Although the sites did not share many of the same fire years, 
all three sites recorded similar numbers of fires during the period 1774-1929 (21 fires in 
SO, 23 fires in DI, and 17 fires in MA). 
We were able to determine seasonality of55% of the fire scars. Of those, 92% 
were found on the ring boundary, meaning that the majority of fires occurred in the 
dormant season (Table 2.1). Another 5% were found in early earlywood, and 3% were 
found in middle earlywood. No scars were found in the late earlywood or latewood. 
A dramatic decline in fire frequency occurred after the 1920s (Fig. 2.2). Site SO 
experienced one fire between 1920 and 1998 (1955), DI had no fires between 1929 and 
1998, and MA had one fire between 1929 and 1995 (1951). Site SO had a 43-year fire-
free interval, DI had a 69-year fire-free interval, and MA had a 44-year fire-free interval. 
The fire-free periods in the twentieth century were unprecedented in the previous 300+ 
years: previously, the longest intervals without fire in each of the sites were 19,32, and 
16 years, respectively. 
Peiia Nevada showed no evidence of a hiatus in fire occurrence that would 
coincide with the gap in fire in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries 
documented at many sites in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. 
We did, however, observe a gap from the 1680s to 1717, and another period of few fires 
from the 1750s to 1774, as reflected in reduced fires per decade (Fig. 2.2).

Fire-Climate 
ENSO events were related to fire occurrence in the early portion of our period of 
analysis, but the relationship changed over time. Results from the SEA analyses indicate 
that in the period 1645-1831 fires were likely to occur in La Nina years (years when 
NIN03 values were significantly below average; Fig. 2.3). This relationship was 
significant (p<0.05) for fires that scarred ~5% of recording trees. Between 1832 and 
1929, however, there is no significant relationship between ENSO and years when fires 
burned, regardless of the size ofthe fire. For fires that scarred ~25% of recording trees 
before 1831, the 3-5 years before fire years had significantly above-average NIN03 
values. After 1832, the year immediately prior to widespread fires (those that scarred 
~25% of recording trees) had significantly above-average NIN03 values. 
The decoupling of La Nina and dry, fire-prone years in the early nineteenth 
century was further explored with additional analyses. First, SEA analyses associating 
extreme ENSO events and precipitation show that before 1830, extreme La Nina events 
(Stahle and Cleaveland 1993) were likely to be very dry (p<O.OI), but approximately 
average after 1832 (Fig. 2.3). Second, by overlaying SOl extremes on a graph of 
reconstructed Pena Nevada winter precipitation (Fig. 2.4), it is evident that from 1700 to 
1830, four of the five El Nino extremes corresponded with precipitation maxima and six 
of the seven La Nina extremes coincided with precipitation minima (Fig. 2.4). Between 
the 1830s and the 1970s, the extremes were less distinguishable in the Pena Nevada 
precipitation record; El Nino extremes still tended to be wet but La Nina extremes ranged 
from dry to wet conditions. In the late twentieth century, it appears the patterns of 
precipitation during extreme ENSO events have diverged even more dramatically. The El

Nifio events of 1983 and 1998 were extremely dry years at Pefia Nevada; 1998 was the 
second-driest year at Pefia Nevada since 1508 in a precipitation reconstruction using 
Douglas-fir annual rings (Villanueva-Diaz et al. 2007). Since 1508, only 1805, which was 
an extreme La Nifia year, was drier. 
Regardless of ENSO phases, fires occurred more often in dry years at Pefia 
Nevada throughout the period of analysis (Fig. 2.3). Only the "all fires" relationship 
between fire years and precipitation before 1831 did not reach 95% significance. The 
other categories of fire both before 1831 and after 1832 were significantly related to years 
of low precipitation. The seven years when fires occurred in all three sites were 
significantly dry, and there was also, on average, a significantly wet year two years prior 
to these seven fire years (not shown). 
Discussion 
What were the characteristics of the fire regime? 
Before the 1920s, the fire regime at Pefia Nevada was characterized by relatively 
frequent surface fires, as indicated by our reconstruction reaching back several hundred 
years. Individual trees were scarred by fire up to 10 times each; on average, individual 
trees were experiencing and surviving fires less than every two decades throughout their 
lives (individual tree mean fire interval 17 years). This is a conservative estimate, as not 
all fires leave scars on recording trees, and we excluded fires with uncertain dates from 
all statistical analyses. The historical fire regime at Pefia Nevada is similar to the 
historical low-severity surface fire regime found in the more northerly dry coniferous 
forests of northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States (Fule and Covington 
1999, Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003, Stephens et al. 2003, Fule et al. 2005). This is true

even though the dominant species at Pefia Nevada (P. hartwegii) is different from any 
species sampled in other fire history studies, and these sites are at a much higher 
elevation. 
Unlike some high elevation sites in the western United States (Kipfmueller and 
Baker 2000, Margolis et al. 2007), we did not find evidence of stand-replacing fires from 
the 1500s through the early 1900s, although there is a possibility that site MA 
experienced a stand-replacing fire in the early 1700s based on the lack of sample 
coverage before 1725 and the pulse of regeneration between 1726 and 1742. In addition, 
although we found old, fire-scarred trees dating back centuries in our other sites, meaning 
that no stand-replacing fire at the 25-ha scale had occurred since at least ~ 1600, it is 
possible that smaller patches within our sites experienced high-severity fire that we did 
not detect. We conclude that the historical fire regime was dominated by low-severity 
surface fires, with the possibility of patchy stand-replacing disturbances in some sites. 
A stand-replacing fire did occur in 1998 in all three sites after decades of fire 
exclusion, and there is evidence that a severe, stand-replacing fire occurred in 1983 on a 
different part of the mountain. There are two possible explanations for the seemingly 
anomalous severity of these fires in the late twentieth century. One is that decades of fire 
exclusion led to a buildup of fuels which facilitated the crown fires in the extremely dry 
years of 1983 and 1998. The other possible scenario is that our three ridgetop sites 
captured evidence of predominantly surface fires. We leave open the possibility that the 
larger Pefia Nevada landscape historically experienced some severe fires as well as 
surface fires and that the late twentieth century severe fires were not as unusual as the 
evidence suggests.

More than half the fires during the period of analysis were small and burned in 
only one ofthe three sites sampled. Surprisingly, since the three sites are within a 3 km 
section of the ridgetop, fires were not generally synchronous between the three sites. 
Only seven fire dates between 1774 and 1929 were recorded at all three sites. These 
results suggest that fires in our sites were frequent but not usually very large. Frequent 
but small and asynchronous fires have also been found in western Mexico, in the Sierra 
Madre Occidental (FuM and Covington 1999), although in other areas of the Sierra Madre 
Occidental fires were historically more large and synchronous (Fule et al. 2005). 
An unusual feature of the Peiia Nevada fire history is the almost complete 
dominance of dormant-season fires (206 of224; 92%); almost all of the fires recorded 
occurred before cambial growth began. Although little is known about growth phenology 
in this region, the dominance of scars on the ring boundary or in the early earlywood 
suggests that the majority of scars were formed in the spring or early summer. These 
seasonality results, including the lack of scars in the latewood, support the assumption 
that dormant-season fires occur in the spring rather than in the fall. We hypothesize that 
the high percentage of dormant-season scars at Peiia Nevada is due to the high elevation. 
Cambial growth of trees likely begins relatively late in the year, while most lightning 
strikes in this area occur during the spring before the first precipitation peak in May 
(IMTA 2007). In sites studied in western Mexico, percentage of dormant-season fires 
ranged from 0.3% (Skinner et al. 2008) to 47% (Fule et al. 2005) to 56% (Fule and 
Covington 1999) to 63% (Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003). 
This is the first study to quantify fire history from fire scars in a P. hartwegii 
forest. This species is capable of basal resprouting, which has been interpreted in other 
18

tree species as an adaptation to stand-replacing disturbance, including crown fire 
(Rodriguez-Trejo and Fule 2003). However, we did not see any P. hartwegii sprouts at 
Pefia Nevada, and our data indicate that in our sites, the P. hartwegii forest sustained a 
surface fire regime for the past several hundred years. 
Was the fire regime interrupted in the twentieth century? 
The near cessation of fires after the 1920s is likely related to the formation of 
Ejido La Encantada on Pefia Nevada in 1937. Ejidos are communities that live on rural 
lands that are held in common and managed with some level of governmental control 
(Thoms and Betters 1998). In the Sierra Madre Occidental, a decrease in the percentage 
of sites with fire around 1930 coincided with the granting of lands to ejidos (Heyerdahl 
and Alvarado 2003). Heyerdahl and Alvarado speculated that granting land to ejidos may 
have changed the fire regime through the introduction or intensification of cattle grazing, 
road building, logging, and changing the traditional role of fire. These same factors likely 
changed the fire regime at Pefia Nevada when Ejido La Encantada was formed. Other 
hypotheses are less likely; there is no evidence of a climatic change in this area in the 
early 1900s (Villanueva-Diaz et al. 2007), and throughout Mexico fire regimes were 
disrupted during different decades (i.e. the 1930s and 40s [Fule and Covington 1999] and 
the 1950s [Fule et al. 2005]) or not at all. This suggests that climate is not responsible for 
the cessation of fires after the 1920s at Pefia Nevada. Fire suppression policy is probably 
not the reason for the cessation of fires either: control efforts in this area have been 
limited in scope (local crews and landowners rather than engines and helicopters).

We have no data on human population history or the history of fire use at Pefia 
Nevada, and we cannot distinguish human ignitions from lightning ignitions throughout 
the period of record. The many small fires on the peak indicate many local ignitions, 
meaning that fires did not always start in the centers of population in the valleys below. 
Given the elevation of the mountain, lightning strikes probably occur often. Lightning in 
this area peaks before the early summer rains begin, which is consistent with the fact that 
almost all fires with determinable season occurred in spring or early summer before 
cambial growth began. However, humans may also have ignited fires in these high-
elevation forests. It is most likely that both lightning and humans caused fires 
historically. 
What are the effects of ENSO and other climate patterns on fires in this region of 
Mexico? 
As expected, fires tended to burn at Pefia Nevada during dry years. This pattern 
did not change throughout the period of record. For most categories of fire, we saw no 
evidence that fires were related to high precipitation in years preceding fires, as has been 
found in many sites in the southwestern United States (e.g., Grissino-Mayer et al. 2004). 
However, the seven years in which fires burned all three sites show evidence of occurring 
two years after a wet year, which could indicate that the most widespread fires were 
influenced by the buildup of fine fuels during wet years. 
The most striking characteristic ofthe relationship between ENSO, dry years, and 
fire at Pefia Nevada is the shifting relationship between El NifiolLa Nifia, precipitation, 
and fire over time, with one shift occurring around 1830 and another occurring in the last 
20

few decades (around 1970). Before the 1830s, La Nina had a significant effect on the 
occurrence of fire at Pena Nevada: negative NIN03 values were strongly associated with 
fire years (Fig. 2.3). This is consistent with studies in northwestern Mexico and the 
southwestern United States, where La Nina years tend to be dry and associated with fires 
(Swetnam and Betancourt 1998, Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003, Kitzberger et al. 2007, 
Drury and Veblen 2008). After 1830, the relationship between fire and La Nina at Pena 
Nevada was not significant. Fires continued to bum in dry years, but they were no longer 
associated with La Nina (Fig. 2.3). Since the 1970s, extreme ENSO events have been 
more erratic; the extreme EI Nino events of 1983 and 1998 were very dry at Pena Nevada 
but the 1992 extreme El Nino was very wet (Fig. 2.4). 
While numerous studies have associated ENSO patterns with fire occurrence in 
the Americas, to our knowledge this is the first study to document a change in the effects 
of EN SO on the occurrence of fire over time. The reason for the change is not clear. We 
hypothesize that the changing nature of the ENSO-fire relationship could be due to 1) the 
location of this study site, 2) climatic shifts associated with the late eighteenth-early 
nineteenth century gap in fire or 3) possible effects from climate change. Pena Nevada is 
located in the transition zone, or dipole, of ENSO effects: northwestern Mexico tends to 
be dry during La Nina events while southern Mexico tends to be dry during EI Nino 
events (Magana et al. 2003). Because this is the first fire-climate study in this part of 
North America, we do not know if this result is anomalous or typical. Tree ring 
chronologies and precipitation reconstructions from elsewhere in the Sierra Madre 
Oriental show that 1998 was anomalously dry in other places in northeastern Mexico. 
This is also evident in maps of extreme EI Nino events created by Magana et al. (2003). 
21

The dryness in an EI Nino winter normally extends up partway through Mexico, but in 
1998 the drying extended much further north, including our study area. We will explore 
further whether geographic location in relation to spatial teleconnections is responsible 
for the shifting effects of ENSO on precipitation and fire as we analyze data from other 
fire-climate studies in this region, currently underway. 
Although we saw no evidence of a hiatus in fire at Pena Nevada coincident with 
the late eighteenth-early nineteenth century gap in fire, as has been recorded at many 
other sites in North and South America, the first shift in ENSO effects at this site 
occurred around 1830, which is approximately when changes in fire regime, or in some 
cases the end of the hiatus, happened in several other areas. For example, Stephens et al. 
(2003) noted less frequent and more synchronous fires after ~ 1830 in the Sierra San 
Pedro Martir in northern Baja California. Sakulich and Taylor (2007) also documented a 
shift from frequent small bums to less frequent larger bums after 1800 in their study area 
in western Texas. The reasons and the precise dates for the shift in fire regime, or in some 
cases "the gap," are still unresolved. Hypotheses include decreased amplitude and/or 
frequency of EN SO, a cool phase of the AMO, a cool phase ofthe PD~, and lower 
variability in climate in general (Donnegan et al. 2001, Kitzberger et aI. 2001, Heyerdahl 
et al. 2002, Grissino-Mayer et al. 2004, Brown and Wu 2005, Sibold and Veblen 2006, 
Kitzberger et al. 2007, Brown et al. 2008a, Skinner et al. 2008). It is possible that at Pena 
Nevada one or more of these hypotheses could explain the change in ENSO effects in 
approximately 1830 and the change after the 1970s as well. 
The change in ENSO effects at Pena Nevada in the late twentieth century (around 
1970) is more dramatic than the early 1800s change. After centuries of receiving above-

average precipitation during El Nifio events, Pefia Nevada experienced the second-driest 
year in almost 500 years during the El Nifio event of 1998 (Villanueva-Diaz et al. 2007). 
The year 1983, when another El Nifio event occurred, was also dry at Pefia Nevada 
according to the local tree-ring record. Some scientists attribute the unprecedented 
amplitudes of the 1983 and 1998 El Nifio events to anthropogenic ally induced global 
climate changes, while others do not (Fedorov and Philander 2000). Global warming is 
likely to affect El Nifio by altering the background climate, but of the several projections 
that have been made about details of these changes, it is currently impossible to know 
which, if any, are correct (Fedorov and Philander 2000, Tudhope and Collins 2003). In an 
analysis from 1948 to 1999, the number and extent of fires in the Everglades were greater 
during La Nifia years than El Nifio years (Beckage et al. 2003). In 1998, however, more 
than 500,000 acres in Florida burned, which is much higher than the 1981-2008 average 
of205,000 acres (Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Division of 
Forestry; http://www.fl-dof.comlwildfire/stats _daily _reports.html). The anomalous 
effects on fire of the 1998 EI Nifio may have had an impact reaching well beyond 
northeastern Mexico. 
Were the fires in the 1998 El Nino an anomaly? 
At our sites on Pefia Nevada, we have evidence of both top-down and bottom-up 
control of fires, including the anomalously severe fire of 1998. The severity of this fire 
was probably due in large part to top-down influences of climate: low precipitation and 
high temperatures. In 1998, Pefia Nevada received very little precipitation. The year 1998 
was also the warmest year of the 20th century (McPhaden 1999), which may have 
23

influenced the area burned globally that year, as well as area burned in Mexico and the 
Sierra Madre Oriental. Unusually severe wildfires like the one that burned Pefia Nevada 
in 1998 will probably occur again if projections of warming and drying are realized 
(Westerling et al. 2006, Seager et al. 2007, Seager et al. 2009). 
Changes in the bottom-up influences of fuels and forest structure also may have 
had an impact on the large size and severity of the El Nifio fire of 1998. The forests in our 
sites, adapted to fairly frequent surface fire, had not experienced wildfires for over 40 
(and in some cases almost 70) years before 1998. The resulting buildup of fuels and 
changes in canopy structure over time may have contributed to the severe impacts that 
occurred when a fire finally did burn during a dry year. 
The low-intensity surface fires that historically burned in our sites were also likely 
influenced by both top-down and bottom-up effects. Evidence for bottom-up control is 
the dominance of small, asynchronous fires that occurred at only one of the three sites 
from 1645 to 1929, suggesting that differences in fuels, ignitions, and site characteristics 
were important at this small scale. 
Top-down influence on the historical low-intensity surface fires is evidenced by 
the strong relationship of fire with dry years, throughout the period of record. In addition, 
before the 1830s, ENSO also had a strong relationship with fire occurrence. Prior to the 
1920s, when fire exclusion began, bottom-up controls like fuel availability probably 
moderated top-down climatic influences. However, the bottom-up control that fuel 
exerted was eliminated when fire exclusion began and fuels became more homogeneous 
and probably more dense. This may have allowed top-down extreme climatic controls to 
dominate fire behavior in the late 20th century. We conclude that fires at this site are

under the influence of top-down, regional to global influences as well as site-specific 
factors. 
The dominant trees at Pefia Nevada survived multiple fires over centuries, but an 
event of mass mortality occurred in our study area in 1998, probably due to a 
combination of fuel buildup and extreme dryness. Considering possible changes in future 
climate and the biological importance of the Sierra Madre Oriental, including the high 
number of local endemics, this merits concern and the development of new strategies for 
conservation. In some parts of Mexico, excessive human-originated fire has contributed 
to deforestation or forest structure changes in pine forests. Public education campaigns 
have been implemented throughout the country to reduce excessive burning (Rodriguez-
Trejo and Fule 2003). However, in the Sierra Madre Occidental in northwestern Mexico, 
there are areas where fire frequency today is similar to historical fire frequency and areas 
where fires, historically frequent, have been absent or rare for decades (Rodriguez-Trejo 
and FuIe 2003). Based on our reconstruction of fire history at Pefia Nevada, fires 
occurred much less frequently after the 1920s than in the previous several centuries. Fire 
suppression in areas with fire regimes historically characterized by frequent surface fires 
is not the best management tool, as it may contribute to forest change, fuel buildup and 
increased risk of catastrophic crown fires. It is useful to understand the historical fire 
regimes of these forests to design the best management approaches for these areas. In 
addition, understanding how ENSO and other climate factors influence precipitation and 
fire is important; ENSO may no longer be a reliable indicator of precipitation or fire 
occurrence or behavior in this part of Mexico. It will be valuable to expand the network 
of fire-climate sites to enhance our understanding of fire-climate relationships and to

further investigate whether ENSO effects on precipitation and fire are changing 
throughout the region or whether it is a site-specific phenomenon.

CHAPTER 3: COMPARING THE RELATIVE INFLUENCE OF BROAD-SCALE 
AND FINE-SCALE FACTORS ON FIRE OCCURRENCE IN NORTHEASTERN 
MEXICO 
Abstract 
Factors that affect fire occurrence operate on a continuum of scale, from fine-scale 
microsite variation in topography to broad-scale global climate oscillations. Fine-scale 
factors interrupt fire synchrony across landscapes, while broad-scale factors are 
influential in synchronizing fire across landscapes and even continents. In northeastern 
Mexico, we selected a study area with useful characteristics for distinguishing the 
influence of broad-scale vs. fine-scale factors. We worked in 9 sites on three parallel 
mountain ranges that receive nearly identical broad-scale climatic influence, but between 
which fires could unlikely spread. Our objectives were to 1) characterize the historical 
fire regime and describe the occurrence of low-severity and high-severity fire in our sites, 
2) assess the relative influence of broad-scale and fine-scale factors by quantifying 
synchrony of fire dates within and among sites and mountain ranges, and 3) determine 
what influence the EI Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) had on fire occurrence and 
assess the stability of the relationship over time. We collected and cross-dated 383 fire-
scarred samples and identified years in which fires occurred. We found that surface fires 
were the dominant fire type in our study area over the past several centuries, although 
there is evidence of high-severity disturbance at the scale of <25 ha. We also found low 
fire synchrony among mountains, indicating a strong influence of fine-scale factors on 
fire occurrence. Finally, La Nina events were associated with fire over time, although not 
significantly since the 1830s. Our results highlight the importance of scale in describing

fire regimes and suggest that we can use fire history to understand the controls on 
complex ecosystem processes. 
Introduction 
The relative influence of broad-scale and fine-scale controls on fire regimes 
depends on the scale of analysis and on the strength of the controls in a given area (Falk 
et al. 2007, Kellogg et al. 2008). Climate is a significant driver of wildfire synchrony at 
regional to continental scales (e.g. Swetnam and Betancourt 1990, Swetnam 1993, 
Heyerdahl et al. 2002, Kitzberger et al. 2007, Heyerdahl et al. 2008). Synchronous 
regional fire years, in which widely separated sites burn in the same year, can result from 
periods of widespread drought associated with regional-scale climate patterns. Human 
activity has also been described as a broad-scale influence on fire (Brown et al. 2001); for 
example, large landscapes in the southwestern USA were affected by humans between 
1870 and 1900 when surface fire regimes were interrupted due to the introduction of 
livestock, logging, predator control, land use changes, and fire suppression (Swetnam and 
Baisan 2003). 
Fine-scale variation in factors such as ignitions, topography, and fuel type, 
amount, and connectivity may reduce synchrony in fire between sites because they exert 
independent influences on a site-by-site basis, increasing heterogeneity in burn patterns 
(Brown et al. 2001, Kellogg et al. 2008, Iniguez et al. 2009). Controls may shift 
depending on the relative strength of forcing factors; fine-scale topographic influences or 
factors such as human ignition sources may be stronger in years with mild climate, but 
severe fire weather can override local factors and result in widespread synchrony of fire 
occurrences (Flatley et al. 2011).

Our understanding of the scales at which fine-scale and broad-scale factors 
influence fire occurrence is incomplete, although several studies have examined controls 
on fire at multiple scales (Falk et al. 2007). For example, Heyerdahl et al. (2001) inferred 
the influence of broad-scale factors using among-watershed variation in fire regime and 
the influence of fine-scale factors using within-watershed variation, and concluded that 
both broad-scale and fine-scale factors are influential on fire frequency, size, and season 
in the interior western United States. In another example from the Klamath Mountains, 
variation in fire frequency was related to aspect, and topographic features that acted as 
barriers to fire spread were important in defining spatial patterns of fire on the landscape 
(Taylor and Skinner 2003). Finally, Hessl et al. (2004) found that in the state of 
Washington, climate (summer drought and the positive phase ofthe Pacific Decadal 
Oscillation) was linked to fire, but these relationships were overridden by land use 
changes in the twentieth century. 
Various studies have also explored the controls on fire using models. Parisien et 
al. (2010) found in a modeling exercise that weather-related variables had a larger effect 
on mean bum probability, while fuels and ignitions had a larger effect on the variability 
of burn probability, but the authors noted that cleanly separating broad-scale and fine-
scale factors is not possible. Other modeling exercises have demonstrated that broad-
scale controls are more important in topographically simple landscapes, while fine-scale 
controls are more important in topographically complex landscapes (Kellogg et al. 2008, 
Kennedy and McKenzie 2010). 
Understanding how climate, as the most broad-scale factor affecting fire, interacts 
with controls at different scales and with fire occurrence itself, can help us anticipate 
39

changes that might occur as climate change progresses. Fire-climate information is also 
important from a management perspective, as one of the ways managers influence fire 
occurrence and severity is through the manipulation of fine-scale factors of fuels and 
prescribed ignitions. If fire is mostly controlled by broad-scale climate patterns, such 
management will be less effective (We sterling et al. 2006). 
Fire/climate relationships in temperate pine forests of Mexico are among the 
least-studied in North America (Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003). In northwestern Mexico, 
some studies have found a relationship between the EI Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 
negative phase (La Nina), drought, and fire occurrence (Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003, 
Skinner et al. 2008). Another study documented a lag-year effect where fires tend to 
occur one year after a wet EI Nino (positive ENSO phase) year (Drury and Veblen 2008). 
Only one long-term fire/climate study has been carried out previously in northeastern 
Mexico (although see Gonzalez Tagle et al. 2007 for another fire reconstruction in the 
area), at Pena Nevada, a peak dominated by high-elevation Pinus hartwegii (Lindl.) 
forests (Yocom et al. 2010). There, Yocom et al. (2010) found patterns of frequent fire 
and a strong relationship between drought and fire years. The relationship between ENSO 
and fire changed in the 1830s: before the 1830s, La Nina events were strongly associated 
with fire occurrence, but the relationship disappeared after the 1830s and in recent years 
fires have burned at Pena Nevada during both strong EI Nino and La Nina events. Also at 
Pena Nevada, Yocom et al. (2010) found one stand to be composed mostly of even-aged 
trees, with several synchronous pith (center) dates. Synchronous pith dates can be 
evidence of high-severity fire or other disturbance, which opens up growing space for a 
cohort of seedlings to establish (Brown and Wu 2005, Brown 2006).

The northern end of the Sierra Madre Oriental, in northeastern Mexico, provides a 
"natural experiment" to investigate the relative influences of broad-scale and fine-scale 
controls. This part of the Sierra consists of a series of east-west oriented, high, parallel 
forested mountain ranges separated by deep, non-forested valleys (Fig. 3.1). The 
distinctive topography allowed us to examine fire patterns in sites on mountain tops 
separated by only ~ 10 km. Because the mountain ranges are in such close proximity to 
each other, they experience the same broad-scale climatic influences, such as ENSO and 
regional drought. However, fire starts on individual mountain ranges are independent 
because fires would be unlikely to spread between them. Quantifying fire synchrony 
between sites and among mountain ranges thus allows us to differentiate between broad-
scale and fine-scale controls on fire regimes. Broad-scale influence would be indicated by 
high fire synchrony among sites and among mountain ranges, suggesting that climate 
events (e.g. regional droughts, El Nino or La Nina events) strongly affected fire 
occurrence. Fine-scale control would be indicated by highly asynchronous fire 
occurrence among sites and among ranges, suggesting that fine-scale factors such as 
topography, fuels, and ignition sources were more important in determining the 
occurrence of fire. At the finest scale, differences among sites within mountain ranges 
could be attributable to local variation in topography or fuels. Intermediate levels of 
synchrony would indicate combinations of controlling factors at a given scale. 
Our objectives were to 1) characterize the historical fire regime and describe the 
occurrence of low-severity and high-severity fire in our sites, 2) assess the relative 
influence of broad-scale and fine-scale factors by quantifying synchrony of fire dates 
among sites and mountain ranges, and 3) determine the influence the El Nino-Southern

Oscillation (ENSO) on fire occurrence and assess the stability ofthe relationship over 
time. 
Methods 
Study Area 
We sampled nine sites on three different mountain ranges: San Antonio 
(southernmost; referred to as South), La Viga (middle; Central), and Rancho Nuevo 
(northernmost; North; Fig. 3.1). Three sites on each of these ranges were selected based 
on the presence of old trees or old remnant wood, in an effort to compile the longest 
possible tree-ring record. South Mountain had a shallow bowl with a meadow at the top; 
the three sites on South Mountain surrounded this meadow and faced south or southwest 
(Table 3.1). Average elevation of sites on South Mountain was 3259 m and average slope 
was 29%. The Central and North Mountains had sharp east-west ridgelines and the three 
sites on each of these mountains were located on the steep northern slopes. Sites on 
Central Mountain had an average elevation of 3388 m and average slope of 44%, and 
sites on North Mountain had an average elevation of3144 m and average slope of 42%. 
The three mountain ranges were dominated by various mixtures of Pinus hartwegii, 
Pinus strobiformis (Engelmann), Abies vejarii (Martinez), and Pseudotsuga menziesii 
(Mirb.) Franco (Farjon 1990, Farjon and Styles 1997). The mountains in this region are 
the result of uplift and folding and exposed rock is limestone (Ferrusquia-Villafranca 
1993). Weather data from San Antonio de las Alazanas (25
0 16'N, 100
0 37' W), near our 
study sites but at a lower elevation (2,170 m), indicated a yearly temperature average of 
13° C and average yearly precipitation of 437 mm (1954 - 1999). Given the dry adiabatic 
lapse rate of9.8 °C per 1000 m in elevation, yearly average temperature at our sites was 
42

between 1 and 3.5 °C. Average precipitation was likely higher than 437 mm at our study 
sites. Forests in this area have been used for centuries by local people for timber, 
fuelwood, and resin production (Ortega-Jimenez 2008). Fire suppression began in earnest 
with the publication in 1930 of regulations organizing the suppression of wildfires in this 
region (Ortega-Jimenez 2008). 
Field Sampling 
We collected fire-scarred tree samples from the study sites in 2001 (a pilot study 
done as part ofthe North American Dendroecological Fieldweek; Speer et al. 2006), 
2007 and 2008. We established three 25-ha sites on each mountain, for a total of9 sites. 
Sites on South Mountain are referred to as SI, S2, and S3, and so on (Fig. 3.1). On each 
mountain, study sites were spaced at a minimum of 0.5 km and a maximum of 2 km 
apart. We systematically searched each site and took fire-scarred samples that would 
provide good spatial distribution throughout the site, and we collected between 24 and 61 
samples per site. We sampled dead trees of any species with the largest numbers of well-
preserved fire scars (VanHorne and Fule 2006), but we also sampled live trees, which 
often had only one or two scars, to ensure that the fire history extended up to the present. 
We used chain saws to remove partial cross sections of fire-scarred trees. We recorded 
the location of each tree to map the sample locations in each site. 
In a companion study, to characterize forest species composition, we established 
and sampled 20 plots each in S2, C 1, and Nl. Overstory trees and stumps were measured 
in 200 m2 circular plots. Data recorded for each tree included species, dbh, and height. 
Stumps were identified to species and diameter was recorded. We also took sections of 
43

several stumps from site S2 for dendrochronological analysis to determine when they 
were cut. 
Laboratory Methods 
In the laboratory, samples were sanded with increasingly finer grits of sandpaper 
until individual cells were clearly visible under a microscope. We visually crossdated 
each sample using a Pseudotsuga menziesii tree-ring chronology from Central Mountain 
(Villanueva-Diaz et al. 2007). The crossdating of a 10% subset of the samples was 
confirmed by a second dendrochronologist. We also measured the ring widths of each 
sample and checked the crossdating with the COFECHA software program (Holmes 
1983). We identified fire scars to the year of formation by noting the crossdated ring in 
which the fire injury occurred (Baisan and Swetnam 1990). When possible, fire scars 
were determined to be located in the early earlywood (EE), middle eadywood (ME), late 
earlywood (LE), latewood (L), or on the boundary between rings (indicating a dormant 
(D) season fire). We assigned dormant season fires to the subsequent calendar year. We 
grouped fires into spring (D + EE) and summer (ME + LE + L) categories for seasonal 
evaluation. 
Analysis 
To quantify the historical fire regime, we calculated surface fire interval 
distributions for periods in which there was an adequate tree-ring record (Table 3.1), 
defined as beginning in the first fire year when at least 3 samples in that site were 
recording. The period of analysis for each site ended on the last year when at least 3 
44

samples were scarred in order to describe the historical fire regime prior to a dramatic 
drop in fire frequency in the 19th or 20th centuries. The only exception was site 3b: 
although 8 samples were scarred in 1982, this fire followed an unprecedented period of 
73 years without a fire that scarred more than one tree, and therefore was not included in 
the period of analysis. To assess the possibility of historical high-severity fire occurrence, 
which would have killed trees and opened up growing space for seedling establishment, 
we identified periods in each site with multiple pith dates, by identifying groups of pith 
dates clustered in 30-year periods. 
We calculated fire interval statistics with FHX2 version 3.2 software (Grissino-
Mayer 2001). For each site, we calculated the composite mean fire interval between all 
fires (hereafter referred to as "all fires"), and also between more widespread fires that 
scarred at least 25% of recording trees (hereafter referred to as "widespread fires"). 
Recording trees are those that have been scarred at least once; after an initial wound, trees 
of most species are more likely to scar in subsequent fires (Romme 1980) and therefore 
become "recording trees." We used the Kolmogorov-Smimov goodness-of-fit test 
(a=0.05) to determine whether the Weibull median probability intervals (WMPI) fit the 
data adequately. The WMPI is the fire interval associated with the 50% exceedance 
probability of a modeled Weibull function fit to an empirical fire interval distribution 
(Grissino-Mayer 2001). Using JMP software, we also used Tukey's HSD (a=0.05) to test 
whether there were significant differences in mean fire interval among sites and among 
mountains. 
To test whether fires occurred synchronously among sites and among mountains 
more often than would be expected by chance, we used chi-square tests. We used a 2x2 
45

contingency analysis to compare observed vs. expected values of fire co-occurring on 0, 
1, 2, or 3 mountains, since we did not expect that fires would spread between ranges due 
to the topography, vegetation differences between mountain ranges and valleys, and 
human settlements in the valleys (Grissino-Mayer 1995). We combined the 2 and 3 
mountain categories to achieve a cell value greater than 5, which is necessary for the test. 
Expected values were estimated from joint probabilities of fire occurring or not occurring 
on the mountains. A 2x1 analysis was used to test synchrony between pairs of sites within 
each mountain since fire could easily spread between sites on each mountain. 
We also evaluated the synchrony of fire occurrence patterns over time among 
sites on each mountain using the program KID, which uses a modified Ripley's K 
function to test synchrony over time (Gavin et al. 2006). KID determines the dependence 
between two or more types of events that are ordered in one dimension by calculating the 
multivariate Ripley K-function simplified for one dimension (Gavin 2010). In KID, the K 
function is transformed to the L function, LAAB(t) where values near 0 suggest 
independence, values >0 suggest synchrony, and values <0 suggest asynchrony of fire 
occurrence within a window of t years. KID also constructs 95% confidence envelopes 
for the LAAB(t) function from 1000 randomized simulations of the records. 
To evaluate the influence of EN SO on fire occurrence at our study sites, we used 
superposed epoch analysis (SEA) in FHX2 (Grissino-Mayer 1995) to compare fire 
occurrence with an independently derived ENSO index. The SEA compared 
reconstructed NIN03 values (December-February, 1408-1978; Cook 2000) during 
superposed fire years, five years prior to fire years, and two years after fire years. To 
address temporal autocorrelation in the NIN03 index, we fit autoregressive integrated

moving average models based on lowest Akaike's information criterion and significant 
but uncorrelated parameter estimates (Brown et al. 2008a) and used the resulting white 
noise residuals in our analyses. To assess statistical significance of the SEA results, we 
calculated 95% confidence intervals using bootstrapped distributions of climate data in 
1000 trials. We compared ENSO with the occurrence of all fires regardless of size, as 
well as widespread fires that scarred at least 25% of recording trees in any of the nine 
sites. We analyzed ENSO association with fire before 1831 and after 1832 to evaluate 
whether the relationship changed at the same time that the ENSO/fire relationship 
changed 200 km to the south, at Pefia Nevada. We considered evaluating the relationship 
between fire and local reconstructed Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), obtained 
from the North American Drought Atlas (Cook and Krusic 2004). However, the PDSI 
reconstruction at the closest gridpoint to our study area had a consistent negative 
verification reduction in error (RE) statistic, which is generally interpreted to mean that 
the reconstruction is unreliable (Cook and Krusic 2004). 
Results 
Forest composition 
S2 was dominated by a fairly even mixture of Pinus hartwegii (Lindl.), Pinus 
strobiformis, and Abies vejarii with small numbers of Pseudotsuga menziesii (Farjon and 
Styles 1997). Stumps in site S2 were cut in the mid-20th century. Cl was dominated by P. 
hartwegii with a smaller component of A. vejarii. Nl had mostly A. vejarii and 
Pseudotsuga menziesii trees with very small numbers of P. hartwegii and P. strobiformis. 
In our sites we also found small pockets of P. culminicola (Andresen et Beaman), an

endangered pinyon pine endemic to the Sierra Madre Oriental, as well as isolated 
populations of Populus tremuloides (Michx.), and Prunus sp. Cut stumps in S2 and C1 
were mostly P. hartwegii, and mostly Pseudotsuga menziesii in N1. 
Fire regime 
We collected a total of383 fire-scarred samples in 2001,2007, and 2008, most 
from pines (Pinus hartwegii and P. strobiformis) and a minority from Pseudotsuga 
menziesii and Abies vejarii. We were able to crossdate 357 of the samples (93.2%) and 
1357 fire scars in total (Table 3.1). The earliest fire scar identified in any of the sites was 
from 1422, and the last fire scars formed in 1998. Ofthe fire scars where intra-ring 
position could be determined, 88% were formed in the dormant season. 
Fires were relatively frequent at all sites over the past several centuries. Mean fire 
interval (MFI) for all fires ranged in individual sites from 7.8 to 16.4 years (Table 3.2). 
The Weibull function fit the data adequately in every site; the WMPI ranged from 6.7 to 
13.9 years. For widespread fires (~25% of recording trees scarred), MFI per site ranged 
from 12.7 to 27.6 years. Minimum fire interval in sites ranged from 1 to 4 years and 
maximum fire interval ranged from 19 to 79 years. On average, values of central 
tendency (MF! and WMPI) for all fires and for widespread fires were longest on Central 
Mountain and shortest on South Mountain. However, the differences in MFI between 
mountains were not significant. The only significant difference in MFI among sites was 
found for all fires between S 1 and C 1. 
Several of our sites had pulses of tree regeneration in the past, based on pith dates 
of fire-scarred samples that are clustered within a 30-year period. South Mountain had the 
48

least evidence of pulses of regeneration, with few clusters of pith dates and only 3-6 trees 
per cluster (Fig. 3.2a). Pulses were most pronounced in sites on Central Mountain (C1, 
C2, and C3). Each of the sites had a pulse of regeneration in the mid-1700s (Fig. 3.2b). 
Thirteen samples in site C1 had pith dates between 1745-1758, 11 samples in site C3 had 
pith dates between 1736-1763, and 4 samples in site C2 had pith dates between 1741-
1754. In addition, site C 1 had a pulse of regeneration between 1564-1593 (9 samples), 
and site C2 had a pulse of regeneration between 1636-1662 (13 samples). There was 
evidence of clumps of regeneration on North Mountain as well, but there were fewer 
trees in each pulse (Fig. 3.2c). 
A change in the fire regime occurred in the twentieth century, but the timing of 
the change varied between sites and between mountains (Fig. 3.2). On South Mountain, 
the last multiple-scar fires in sites Sl, S2, and S3 were in 1918, 1887, and 1962, 
respectively. All three sites on Central Mountain (C1, C2, and C3) were consistent in the 
timing of fire exclusion, with the last multiple-scar fire occurring in each site in 1917. On 
North Mountain, the last multiple-scar fire in site N1 was in 1909, site N2 had a multiple-
scar fire in 1909 and not again until 1982, and site N3 last experienced a multiple-scar 
fire in 1962. 
Fire synchrony 
Between 1622 and 2009, there were six years in which all three mountains 
recorded a fire (1622, 1654, 1689, 1785, 1797, and 1838)(Fig. 3.3). The years of highest 
synchrony among sites were 1785 and 1797, when 8 out of the 9 sites recorded fire. 
49

Results of chi-square tests indicate that the level of synchrony among mountains and 
among sites is no higher than would be expected by chance (p>O.OS). 
Levels of within-mountain synchrony over time were different among mountains, 
as shown by graphs of the L function as a function of time (Fig. 3.4). Sites on South 
Mountain showed significant synchrony at 0 and I-year time frames, and trended toward 
asynchrony at longer time windows. Central Mountain had significant synchrony 
between sites at 0-4 years, and significant synchrony at around 13, 17,22, and 33 year 
windows. North Mountain exhibited intermediate levels of synchrony between South and 
Central Mountains. Significant synchrony was shown from 0-2 years and at around 36 
and 64 years. 
Fire-climate 
La Nifia events were significantly associated with the occurrence of fire in our 
study region before 1831 (p<O.OS) and were associated strongly but not significantly after 
1832 (Fig. 3.S). We found some slight differences between ranges and between sites in 
the relationship between fire and ENSO, but splitting the dataset by mountain and site 
reduced the sample size of fire events in the SEA analyses, so the results are not robust 
and are not shown here. 
Discussion 
High-elevation frequent fire regime 
Overall, the three mountains historically had very similar fire regimes in terms of 
fire frequency and seasonality. In general, the fire regime on all three mountains was 
so

characterized by moderately frequent surface fire. However, there is variation among the 
mountains. MFI for all fires and widespread fires, WMPI, and maximum interval were all 
longer on average in Central Mountain sites than in sites on the other two mountains. 
South Mountain tended to have the shortest intervals of the three mountains. The 
mountain highest in elevation, Central Mountain, had more pulses of regeneration, which 
could be evidence of small patches of high-severity fire, but we found no evidence in our 
sites of high-severity fire at the scale of25 ha or greater. Brown et al. (2008b) did not 
consider multi-aged stands with recruitment pulses that overlapped living trees (such as 
our sites) to indicate evidence of high-severity fire. However, we argue for the possibility 
that small patches of high-severity fire may have opened up gaps within our sites, at the 
scale of <25 hectares. 
Fine-scale factors more influential than broad-scale factors 
Low fire synchrony among mountain ranges suggests that fine-scale factors were 
most important in regulating fire regimes, with only six shared fire dates on all three 
mountains between 1622 and 2007, out of 126 total fire years during that period (~5%). 
Synchrony in our sites is much lower than in similar settings elsewhere; for example, in 
the Chiricahua Mountains in southeastern Arizona, fire history studies have been done in 
Sara Deming Canyon (Morino and Baisan 2000) and Rustler Park (Seklecki et aI. 1996), 
two areas separated by 13 km of rugged terrain. Those two areas shared 16 fire dates (out 
of 66 total fire dates; 24%) between 1708 and 1894. At a larger scale, a regional analysis 
of fire dates in the Madrean Archipelago (SE Arizona, SW New Mexico, and NW 
Sonora) revealed that there were 30 years between 1648 and 1886 when at least 5 sites 
51

recorded fire (Swetnam 2005). This is a much higher level of synchrony, over a much 
larger region, than we found in our study area. However, synchrony among sites in our 
study area is comparable to synchrony among sites in El Malpais National Monument in 
New Mexico, another study location where some sites were separated by lava flows that 
act as natural barriers. In a 230-year period, 13 fire years coincided at four or more of the 
nine sites (Grissino-Mayer and Swetnam 1997). In comparison, in a 218-year period at 
our study sites, 10 fire years coincided at four or more of the nine sites. Fire synchrony 
among mountains at our site is no more than would be expected by chance alone, which 
indicates strong fine-scale influence on fire occurrence and little synchronization due to 
broad-scale climatic factors. We will discuss possible explanations for the surprisingly 
weak climatic entrainment of fire regimes at this scale in the next section. 
We also found differences among mountains in terms of within-mountain 
synchrony, as shown in the KID graphs. Central Mountain shows several periods of 
significant synchrony at longer time windows. This indicates that the three sites on 
Central Mountain share a decadal-scale pattern in common. The trend toward asynchrony 
on South Mountain indicates that the three sites on South Mountain, at the decadal and 
multi-decadal scales, are acting independently in terms offire occurrence patterns. 
The three mountains were not consistent in the timing of fire exclusion. Sites on 
Central Mountain were uniform; the last multi-scar fire at all three sites was in 1917. 
However, sites on North Mountain had their last multi-scar fires in 1909 or 1952, and 
sites on South Mountain were the least consistent, with last multi-scar fire dates in 1887, 
1918, and 1962 in the three sites. This lack of synchrony in the onset offire exclusion is 
unusual in comparison to many fire history studies from the western United States, where

the onset of fire exclusion was not only consistent across study areas but fairly consistent 
across much of the western United States because ofthe onset of grazing, logging, and 
fire suppression. In western Mexico and in the only other published long-term fire history 
study in the Sierra Madre Oriental, the cessation of frequent fire was coincident with the 
formation of ejidos, which are rural communities living on and managing commonly-held 
land (Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003, Yocom et al. 2010). In the area of our study sites, 
ejidos were formed in the mid- to late-1930s, which does not align exactly with the dates 
oflast fires in our study sites. However, this area has a long history of human use of the 
forest (Ortega-Jimenez 2008); regardless of ejido formation, human influence was 
probably a factor in the cessation of fire at our sites. 
Humans are sometimes considered a broad-scale influence in the western U.S. 
rather than a fine-scale influence because the influx of livestock, large-scale logging by 
settlers, and national fire suppression policies affected much of the region at around the 
same time (Swetnam and Baisan 2003). The lack of consistency at our study sites in 
northeastern Mexico suggests that, unlike in most of the western United States, humans 
influence fire occurrence at finer scales in northern Mexico. The difference could be due 
to differences in infrastructure and economy in the two countries. Railroad building in the 
western United States coincided with a massive increase in livestock grazing, because 
railroads allowed for an export economy. Settlers had incentive to graze as many animals 
as possible because the animals were not for personal use but could be shipped east for 
profit. Huge livestock herds ate the fine fuels necessary for the continuation of surface 
fires and helped cause the cessation of fire somewhat synchronously across the 
southwestern United States (Belsky and Blumenthal 1997). In addition, early grazing in 
53

the western United States was followed by an ambitious and generally successful policy 
of fire suppression that maintained fire exclusion (Pyne 1982). Although Mexico had 
similar policies (Rodriguez-Trejo 1996), the resources for effective backcountry fire 
suppression were much less. 
Why do fine-scale factors prevail? 
Our results suggest that at the scale of our study region, fine-scale factors 
predominate. Climate as a broad-scale factor was not strong enough to synchronize fire 
throughout the region any more than would be expected by chance. Why would this 
occur? 
We do not have conclusive evidence but we can suggest some potential reasons. 
First, some level of stochasticity cannot be ruled out. Lertzman et al. (1988) found in a 
modeling exercise that substantial variability in fire regime can result from purely 
stochastic processes, with no underlying ecological causes. For example, although fine-
scale patterns of lightning strikes actually may not be stochastic, we do not know enough 
about the regulating mechanisms to precisely model lightning at a fine scale and therefore 
we treat it as part of the unexplained variation in fire regimes. 
Second, the high frequency of fire in this study region indicates that fires do not 
bum only in the most extreme climate years. A fire occurred somewhere in the nine sites 
every three years or less in the period common to all nine sites. Climatically, 
opportunities for fires to bum are fairly common; years with NIN03 values equal to or 
less than the average NIN03 value for all fires occurred in 140 out of381 years between

1622 and 2002. If severe La Nina conditions were required for a fire to carry, fires would 
likely be more synchronous throughout the study area. 
There are also several fine-scale factors that vary among the three mountain 
ranges, including elevation, topography, forest species composition, and land use history. 
These are interlinked factors that cannot be untangled; for example, elevation and forest 
species composition are highly correlated. First, elevation varies among mountain ranges. 
Central Mountain is the highest in elevation of the three mountains, with sites on average 
130 m higher than sites on South Mountain and 244 m higher than on North Mountain. 
Central Mountain had the longest fire intervals, the most synchronous fires, and the 
strongest, most synchronous pulses of regeneration, which could indicate a history of 
higher-intensity disturbance. Many other studies have found longer fire intervals, more 
synchronous fires, and more stand-replacing disturbance with increasing elevation 
(Brown et al. 2001, Ful6 et al. 2003, Margolis and Balmat 2009). Brown et al. (2001) 
note that fire severity and fire extent generally increase at higher elevations because of 
longer time periods between fires due to moister conditions, greater fuel loadings, higher 
fuel moisture, and more continuous fuel across a landscape. South Mountain, at 
intermediate elevation, has a fire regime characterized by higher fire frequency than the 
other mountains, lower synchrony among sites, and the least evidence of stand-replacing 
disturbances. North Mountain is the lowest in elevation but has an intermediate pattern of 
fire intervals, synchrony, and evidence for stand-replacing disturbance. Clearly, although 
elevation may playa role, it does not fully explain the differences in fire regimes. 
Topography may be an important fine-scale influence on fire as well. While sites 
on Central and North Mountains were arranged on steep north-facing slopes, sites on 
55

South Mountain were on three less sloping, mostly south-facing sides of a wet meadow. 
This difference in topography may also affect fuels. Average slopes varied; South 
Mountain sites were the least steep with average slopes of 28%. Sites on Central 
Mountain averaged 44% slope, and sites on North Mountain averaged 42% slope. It is 
possible that the steep slopes and lack of a barrier on Central and North Mountains result 
in more synchronous fires across the mountains; slopes have been shown to differ from 
flat areas in terms of fire occurrence (Gavin et al. 2003). South Mountain may experience 
smaller, more stochastic fires because of its flatter topography and the wet meadow in the 
center of the sites. In a study of fire history in the Santa Catalina Mountains in southern 
Arizona, Iniguez et al. (2008) also found that differences in fire history patterns were 
related to landscape-scale topography and differences between vegetation and fuels on 
north vs. south facing slopes. 
Another potential fine-scale factor influencing fire is different species 
composition of the forests on the three mountains. Variation in species composition is 
probably related to elevation and land use history differences among the three mountains. 
There is only one other published report of Pinus hartwegii fire history: mean fire 
intervals for all fires in that study ranged from 8.6 to 9.6 years (Yocom et al. 2010), 
slightly shorter than the mean fire intervals on Central Mountain, which is also dominated 
by P. hartwegii. Composite mean fire intervals in mixed Pseudotsuga menziesii forests 
were less than 10 years in Texas (Sakulich and Taylor 2007). There are no published 
reports of fire history in A. vejarii mixed forests; Abies has examples of surface-fire-
adapted species such as A. concolor and species adapted to high-severity fire like A.

lasiocarpa. However, it is well-documented that fire characteristics change with both 
elevation and vegetation (e.g. Margolis and Balmat 2009). 
Differences in land use history may also have played a role in influencing fire. As 
elsewhere in Mexico, certainly humans have used fire in this region for various reasons 
over centuries. However, we do not know how many fires humans started in the area 
throughout history, nor whether human ignition patterns were different on the three 
mountains. We also do not know the full history of logging on these mountains, although 
we know from plot measurements that the tree species favored for cutting was different 
on North Mountain compared to South Mountain and Central Mountain. All three 
mountains have roads leading to the top. We saw evidence of grazing on South Mountain 
and seasonal human habitation on South Mountain and Central Mountain, but we don't 
know how much grazing currently takes place and we have no information on historical 
grazing activities. All three mountains are close to small human population centers in the 
valleys below and have probably been visited and used for centuries (Ortega-Jimenez 
2008). 
Kellogg et al. (2008) hypothesized that broad-scale controls are stronger in 
topographically simple landscapes, while bottom-up controls are more important in more 
topographically complex landscapes. This hypothesis was supported by modeling work 
by Kennedy and McKenzie (2010) using fire-scar data, and it is supported by our 
findings of strong bottom-up controls in a topographically very complex area. Flatley et 
al. (2011) concluded that topography is an important influence on fire but also that it can 
be overridden by climate. In our study region, there were only six years when all three

mountains recorded fires, which indicates that in this case the synchronizing effect of 
climate rarely overrides the strong influence of topography. 
The role of ENSO in our study region 
Despite the lack of fire synchrony we found among the three mountains, there is a 
relationship between climate and fire occurrence in our study region. La Niiia events 
were significantly or strongly associated with fire occurrence over time. There was a 
change in the relationship in the 1830s at this study area, but it was nuanced: La Niiia 
events were still strongly associated with fire occurrence after the 1830s although the 
association was no longer significant at the 95% confidence level. This contrasts with 
previous results from Peiia Nevada, where after the 1830s there was no relationship at all 
between ENSO and fire (Yocom et al. 2010). Our results suggest that these study sites, 
being farther north, are not as squarely in the transition zone where ENSO effects change 
over time. To fully investigate this point, we need a network of climate reconstructions 
and fire-climate sites in this region. 
Our results highlight the importance of scale in describing fire regimes and 
suggest that we can use fire history to understand the controls on complex ecosystem 
processes. The three different mountains that we studied are heterogeneous in terms of 
forest composition, topography and elevation, and fires were asynchronous on the three 
mountains despite their close proximity. This emphasizes the importance of limiting 
inferences about a heterogeneous region based on a small sampled area. Our results 
suggest that fine-scale factors may lead to heterogeneous responses to climate change,

even within a small region like our study area. Given these conclusions, further 
exploration of fire-climate relationships in the Sierra Madre Oriental is merited.

CHAPTER 4: OLD FOREST SUPPORTS VERY FREQUENT SURFACE FIRE: 
PICO DE ORIZABA NATIONAL PARK, MEXICO 
Abstract 
Pico de Orizaba in southeastern Mexico is North America's third-tallest peak, supporting 
timberline forests of Pinus hartwegii that are highly isolated from other P. hartwegii 
populations. In 1975, researchers reported that increased human-caused burning was 
degrading the forests on this peak. We measured forest structure and fire history to test 
the hypothesis that human-caused fires have changed the fire regime and degraded the 
forest by increasing mortality and decreasing regeneration. In contrast to northern 
Mexico, where La Nina events are associated with fire, we hypothesized that fire 
occurrence at Pico de Orizaba, which is south of the Tropic of Cancer, is associated with 
EI Nino events. We established 6 sites of 12 ha each in Pico de Orizaba National Park, 
measured forest structure and age distribution, and collected fire-scarred samples. We 
found that the forest was uneven-aged and contained many large and old trees (basal area 
range 16.3 to 34.5 m2 ha-1, maximum age 483 years). In the twentieth century, a fire 
scarred at least one tree in at least one of our sites in 90 of 100 years: a very frequent 
surface fire regime, although most fires were small and asynchronous. We found no 
increase in fire frequency or evidence of recent degradation of the forest, so our first 
hypothesis was not supported, at least for this region of the Park. Inter-annual climatic 
variability was not an influential driver of fire, and ENSO was not significantly related to 
the occurrence of widespread fire, although there was a weak trend toward a fire 
relationship with La Nina events. Our second hypothesis was not supported by these 
results. We conclude that for the portion of Pi co de Orizaba National Park that we 
73

studied, the old forest has supported very frequent fire, not associated with ENSO 
oscillations, for at least 150 years. A trend in the 21 st century toward decreased fire could 
be cause for concern, as a decrease in frequent fire could lead to an increase in tree 
density and a loss of resilience in the face of climate change and other future disturbance. 
Introduction 
Old forests around the world are rare and valuable relicts. Threats to old forests 
include timber cutting, climate change, and disturbance such as severe fire (Abella et al. 
2007). In central Mexico, a series of tall volcanic peaks form a chain of geographically 
isolated "islands" of high-elevation forest. These peaks are of high conservation value 
because they support unique species and are often less disturbed by people than low-
elevation ecosystems that are close to dense populations. They are also important for the 
region's water supply. At the treeline on these peaks, the forests form mono specific 
stands of Pinus hartwegii (Lindl.), Mexico's highest-elevation pine. Since P. hartwegii is 
restricted to the timberline, its populations are highly isolated. In a study of four 
populations of P. hartwegii in Mexico, it was found that each had diverged significantly 
since they were isolated, the isolation was ancient rather than recent, and there is no 
evidence of gene flow between the populations on different mountains (Schaal and 
Leverich 1996). High levels of geographic isolation can lead to demographic and genetic 
instability (Schaal and Leverich 1996). 
Pinus hartwegii has several fire adaptations, including the ability to regenerate 
well in a fire-created seed bed, thick bark, a self-pruning capacity, the ability to recover 
from crown scorch, and the capacity to resprout (Rodriguez-Trejo and Fule 2003). It also

may exhibit the grass stage (Rodriguez-Trejo 2008), another characteristic of fire-adapted 
species. Two fire history studies have been completed in P. hartwegii forests, both in the 
Sierra Madre Oriental of northeastern Mexico, several hundred kilometers north of Pi co 
de Orizaba. The results of those studies indicate that the historical fire regime was 
characterized by frequent surface fires (mean fire intervals ranged from 8.6 to 16.4 
years). In those studies, there was no evidence ofresprouting in any of the P. hartwegii 
trees (Yocom et al. 2010, Yocom et al. in prep.). However, the range of P. hartwegii 
extends from northern Mexico south to Guatemala and Honduras, and it is possible that 
other populations of this species, including those that have been documented to resprout, 
may experience different fire regimes. 
The fire regime in these high-altitude forests is relatively unknown. Rodriguez-
Trejo and Fule (2003) suggested that three categories of forest exist in Mexico: (1) forests 
that have been altered to experience relatively little fire in recent decades as compared to 
historical fire occurrence, due to human-induced fire exclusion, (2) forests that have 
continued to bum at frequencies and severities similar to historical patterns, and (3) 
forests that have received excessive fire with deleterious ecological consequences due to 
human practices of setting fire for agricultural or other uses. Fire history studies that have 
been conducted in Mexico to date have found either a history of regular, frequent fires 
continuing up to the present with little human interference (e.g. Fule et al. in press), or an 
abrupt cessation of fires, correlated with increased human land use including livestock 
grazing, road building, and timber harvesting, often associated with the formation of 
ejidos (e.g. Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003, Yocom et al. 2010). No dendrochronological 
fire history studies have found that human-caused fires are excessive to the point of

degrading the forest, but all of the quantitative fire history studies that have been done in 
Mexico to date were carried out in the more sparsely populated northern part of the 
country. 
In central and southern Mexico, some forests have been degraded by an excess of 
human-caused fires (Roman-Cuesta et al. 2004). One forest that has been reported to 
have experienced degradation due to human-caused fires is on Pico de Orizaba, a high 
volcanic peak in a national park in southeastern Mexico (Fig. 4.1). Lauer and Klaus 
(1975), who studied the timberline at Pico de Orizaba in the 1970s, observed that people 
using the lower slopes of the mountain for animal grazing set fires for agricultural 
reasons. Although Lauer and Klaus (1975) did not quantitatively study the fire regime, 
they speculated that human-ignited fires on these volcanoes were different in several 
ways from natural lightning-caused fires: 1) they take place almost every year, whereas 
natural fires were estimated to occur every 6-7 years, 2) they are set most often in 
February and March while natural fires occurred at the beginning of the rainy season in 
May, and 3) they are started below the timberline and swept up into the crowns of trees 
by the upslope wind, while natural fires typically started at timberline and moved 
downslope as surface fires. They also speculated that the timberline at Pico de Orizaba 
had become lower in elevation due to human-caused fire (Lauer and Klaus 1975, Lauer 
1978). The present study is designed to test several of their ideas. If the hypothesis that 
humans have altered the fire regime by causing an increased number of fires in recent 
decades is correct, this would be the first long-term, dendrochronology-based 
documentation of increased fire due to human activities in Mexico.

The geographical location of Pi co de Orizaba National Park is also ideal for 
testing fire relationships with EI Niiio Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The dipole between 
northern Mexico, where La Niiia events tend to be correlated with dry conditions, and 
southern Mexico, where EI Niiio events tend to be correlated with dry conditions, is 
located close to the Tropic of Cancer (Fig. 4.1). Pico de Orizaba National Park is located 
in the region where EI Niiio conditions are associated with below-average precipitation, 
based on precipitation-ENSO index correlations. In northwestern Mexico, several studies 
have linked fire occurrence to La Niiia events (Fule and Covington 1999, Heyerdahl and 
Alvarado 2003, Fule et al. 2005, Skinner et aI. 2008). In northeastern Mexico, the 
situation is more complicated, with a finding at Peiia Nevada in the Sierra Madre Oriental 
that there was a changing relationship between EI NiiiolLa Niiia phases, precipitation, 
and fire over time, with one change occurring around 1830 and another occurring in the 
late twentieth century (Yocom et al. 2010). At the northern end of the Sierra Madre 
Oriental, there has been a more consistent trend toward an association between La Niiia 
events and fire (Yocom et al. in prep.), but the association is not as strong as it is in the 
Sierra Madre Occidental. In contrast to northern Mexico, fire in southern Mexico is more 
likely to occur during EI Niiio events such as the EI Niiio events of 1983 and 1998 
(Roman-Cuesta et al. 2003). However, there have been no previous fire history 
reconstruction studies done in this region. 
The objectives of this study were to test the following hypotheses and sub-
hypotheses: 
1) Humans have altered the fire regime, which has resulted in degradation of the 
forest. 
77

a. Fire regime changes included an increase in fire frequency, a change in 
fire type from surface fire to crown fire, and a change in seasonality of 
fire. 
b. Forest degradation is evidenced by high tree mortality and little 
regeneration. 
c. Forest structure, demographics, or fuel loads put the forest at risk of severe 
disturbance. 
2) ENSO is related to fire occurrence at this location. 
a. EI Nifio events are associated with fire occurrence. 
b. The relationship between ENSO and fire has been consistent over time. 
Methods 
Site Description 
The study area, Pico de Orizaba National Park, was chosen based on its unique 
characteristics, including its status as a national park (high conservation value and 
potential), its geographical location in Mexico, and because more than thirty years ago, 
scientists noticed what they considered to be changed fire ecology due to human 
activities. 
Pi co de Orizaba, (also called Citlaltepetl, meaning "star mountain" in the Nahuatl 
language), is the highest peak in Mexico and the third highest peak in North America. 
Pico de Orizaba is a dormant volcano; the last known eruption, which was a minor ash 
eruption, was in 1846. The last major eruption was over 4000 years ago (de la Cruz-
Reyna and Carrasco-NUfiez 2002). The volcano is located on the border of the states of 
78

Veracruz and Puebla at the eastern end of the Trans-volcanic Belt, a chain of high 
volcanoes that stretches across central Mexico. The peak has an elevation of 5,675 m 
above sea level. Its companion peak, Sierra Negra, approximately 7 km to the southwest, 
is at 4,600 m above sea level. The forest at the timberline, which is between 3,900 and 
4,200 m, is dominated by Pinus hartwegii (Fig. 4.2), which has been lightly impacted by 
tree cutting or wood gathering. The understory consists mostly of thick bunch grasses 
including Calamagrostis tolucensis (Kunth) Trin. ex Steud., Festuca tolucensis (Kunth), 
and Muhlenbergia quadridentata (Kunth) trin. (Lauer and Klaus 1975). 
Using temporary weather stations, Lauer and Klaus (1975) estimated that mean 
annual temperature at 4000 m above sea level on the north side of Pi co de Orizaba was 5° 
C with an average 6° C mean daily range. Mean annual precipitation was 900 mm, which 
was a decrease from the 1300 mm per year estimated at 3300 m above sea level. 
ENSO-Precipitation Correlation Map of Mexico 
To characterize the relationship between ENSO and precipitation over time in 
Mexico, we created a map of correlations between weather station precipitation data and 
the Southern Oscillation Index (SOl) (see Caso et al. 2007 for a similar map, but 
restricted to the Pacific coast of Mexico). SOl is the difference in surface air pressure 
between Darwin, Australia, and Tahiti and is a measure of EN SO. From the ERICHI 
database, we extracted data for weather stations that had ~ 90% complete data for ~ 30 
years. We calculated correlations between precipitation data from these "high-quality" 
weather stations and SOl and mapped the results, coding each weather station on the map 
by direction and strength of the correlation (Fig. 4.1).

Field methods 
We established 6 sites of 12 ha each at timberline in Pico de Orizaba National 
Park in 2009. The sites are arrayed in the saddle between Pico de Orizaba and Sierra 
Negra (Fig. 4.1). We chose the six sites based on the presence of old trees or old remnant 
wood, with the goal of compiling the longest possible tree-ring record for the analysis of 
fire history and fire-climate relationships. Because of our emphasis on finding old wood, 
this area does not necessarily represent the whole park. The average elevation of the six 
sites ranges from 3912 m to 4132 m above sea level and the average slope ranges from 
38.0% to 60.7% (Table 4.1). 
Fire history 
We collected fire-scarred tree samples from the study sites. We systematically 
searched each site and took fire-scarred samples that would provide good spatial 
distribution throughout the site and the longest fire record possible. We used chain saws 
to remove partial cross-sections of fire-scarred trees, both live and dead. We recorded the 
following data for each sample: tree species, diameter at breast height (DBH), and status 
(live, stump, snag, or log). 
In the laboratory, samples were sanded with increasingly finer grits of sandpaper 
until individual cells were clearly visible under a microscope. We visually crossdated 
each sample, measured the ring widths, and checked the crossdating with the COFECHA 
software program (Holmes 1983). We identified fire scars to the year of formation by 
noting the crossdated ring in which the fire injury occurred (Baisan and Swetnam 1990). 
80

Where possible, we also noted the position of each fire scar within the annual growth 
nng. 
Fire interval statistics were calculated with FHX2 version 3.2 software (Grissino-
Mayer 2001). For each site, we calculated the twentieth-century composite mean fire 
interval between all fires, including fires that only scarred one tree, between fires that 
scarred at least 2 trees, and between more widespread fires that scarred at least 25% of 
recording trees (with a minimum of2 scars). Recording trees are those that have been 
scarred at least once; after an initial wound, injured trees are more likely to scar in 
subsequent fires (Romme 1980) and therefore are "recording trees." We used the 
twentieth century period to compare statistics between sites because all six sites have 
excellent sample depth during that period. We also calculated fire interval statistics for 
each site starting when that site had at least 3 recording samples: those dates for sites 1-6 
are 1888, 1853, 1818, 1902, 1805, and 1849. We also used the Kolmogorov-Smimov 
goodness-of-fit test to determine whether the Weibull distribution fit the data adequately. 
The Weibull median probability interval (WMPI) is the fire interval associated with the 
50% exceedance probability of a modeled Weibull function fit to an empirical fire 
interval distribution (Grissino-Mayer 2001). 
To assess the possibility of historical high-severity fire occurrence, we identified 
fire-free periods in each site with multiple pith dates, by identifying groups of pith dates 
clustered in 30-year periods. Finally, to assess whether human-caused changes have 
altered the fire regime, we looked for trends in fire frequency over time, altered 
seasonality of fires over time, and differences in the percentage of recording trees scarred 
over time.

Forest structure andfuels 
To measure forest structure and age, we established 5 permanent plots in each of 
the 6 sites for a total of 30 plots. Based on a grid, UTM coordinates were chosen for each 
plot center, and we found the center of each plot in the field using a hand-held GPS 
device. We marked each plot with a metal stake and a tree tag. We counted seedlings 
(trees under 1.3 m in height) in 5.64 m circular plots. We measured trees taller than 1.3 m 
in 11.28 m circular plots, and we also measured the four additional closest live trees over 
1.3 m in height in order to increase our sample depth of measured and cored trees. This 
method resulted in plots with radii ranging from 11.95 m to 26.6 m and a total area 
ranging from .045 ha to 0.22 ha. For each tree over 1.3 m in height we recorded height, 
DBH, and diameter at stump height. We also took increment cores from all trees over 1.3 
m in height in order to determine tree ages. We cored trees as close as possible to their 
bases in order to determine tree ages most accurately. We re-cored trees when we 
estimated that the first core missed the center of the tree by 10 or more rings. We 
measured fuels, including litter and duff depth and 10-hr, 100-hr, and 1000-hr sound and 
rotten woody debris, using a 15 m planar transect running in a random direction from the 
center of each plot. We measured canopy cover with a vertical densiometer at 15 points 
along the same line that we used for measuring fuels. 
We calculated trees per hectare and basal area per hectare for each plot. Distances 
to the 4 closest trees were not recorded in plot 4-2, so for that plot we used the average 
plot size in Site 4, which was 0.070 ha (diameter 14.8 m). 
In the laboratory, cores were affixed to core mounts and sanded. We crossdated 
cores when possible and counted rings when necessary in order to obtain an estimate of 
82

each tree's age. When a core did not pass through the center of a tree, we used a template 
of concentric, appropriately-sized circles to estimate the number of rings to the center. 
We grouped tree ages into 10-year classes for analysis. 
Fire and climate 
To evaluate climate conditions related to fire occurrence at our study sites, we 
used superposed epoch analysis (SEA) in FHX2 version 3.2 (Grissino-Mayer 2001) to 
compare an independently derived index of ENSO during fire years, for five years prior 
to fire years, and for two years after fire years. We used an instrumentally-measured 
index of winter NIN03 (Kaplan et al. 1998, Reynolds et al. 2002). We were not able to 
compare fire occurrence with local precipitation or temperature records because the 
records are short, incomplete and not reliable. To assess statistical significance in the 
SEA analyses, confidence intervals (95%) were calculated using bootstrapped 
distributions of climate data in 1000 trials. To compare climate patterns with more 
widespread fires, we identified fire years in which at least 3 sites had the formation of at 
least 2 fire scars. This gave us a list of32 fire years. We also plotted the same 32 
widespread fire years on an index of winter (DJF) instrumentally measured NIN03 
(Kaplan et al. 1998, Reynolds et al. 2002). 
Finally, we compared a list of extreme ENSO events in the 20th century with fire 
occurrence in our study area. ENSO winter Southern Oscillation Index (SOl) values were 
identified between 1699 and 1971 by Stahle and Cleaveland (1993), using tree-ring 
records from Mexico and the United States. Stahle and Cleaveland used two methods to 
reconstruct extreme SOl values, regression and classification, and considered the most

accurate list of extremes to be a list of years when both methods obtained the same results 
for extreme winter SOl values. This is the list we used. After 1971, we determined 
extreme winter SOl values to be December-January-February (DJF) average values (SOl 
data from NCAR's Climate Analysis Section Data Catalog 
(http://www.cgd.ucar.edulcas/cataloglc1imindl) that were> 1.5 standard deviations from 
the average DJF values from 1935 to 2006. Using this method, extreme winter SOl 
values after 1971 were in 1974 and 1976 (La Nina events) and 1983, 1992, and 1998 (EI 
Nino events). 
Results 
Fire history 
We collected 142 fire-scarred samples in the 6 sites, of which 102 (72%) were 
from live trees, 21 (15%) were from snags, 10 (7%) were from logs, and 9 (6%) were 
from stumps. All samples were from P. hartwegii trees. We were able to crossdate 118 of 
the samples (83.1%). 
The first scar that we identified occurred in 1764, and the last scars were formed 
in 2002 (Fig. 4.3). The majority (95.2%) of fire scars for which we could determine 
seasonality (57%) were formed in the dormant period. During the period of excellent 
sample depth in every site (twentieth century), fires were very frequent. The mean fire 
interval for all fires ranged from 2.1 to 3.5 years, the mean fire interval for fires that 
scarred at least two trees ranged from 3.3 to 5.8 years, and the mean fire interval for fires 
that scarred ~25% of recording trees ranged from 6.5 to 9.5 (Table 4.2). The Weibull 
distribution fit our data except for two cases (indicated in Table 4.2). Weibull median

probability interval values were similar but in each case slightly smaller than 
corresponding mean fire interval values, indicating that the distribution of fire intervals is 
skewed toward small intervals. 
In the twentieth century, a fire scarred at least one tree in the 6 sites in 90 out of 
100 years. There were two years in the twentieth century when ~2 trees in all 6 sites were 
scarred: 1902 and 1907. Five sites had the formation of at least 2 scars in 1943 and 1960. 
Prior to 1900, the sample depth was substantially lower in most sites. However, 
calculations of MFI that include data prior to 1900 result in values within 1.2 years of the 
MFI during 1900-2009. The fire frequency changed abruptly after 2000: only one fire 
was recorded, in one site, during the period 2000-2009. This is exceptional compared to 
the twentieth century, when fire was recorded in at least one site in 90% of years. At no 
time did we find changes in seasonality of fires or differences in the percentage of 
recording trees scarred over time. 
Forest structure 
We measured a total of305 live trees and 24 dead trees in the 30 plots. All but 
one were P. hartwegii; the one exception was a Juniperus species. We were able to 
estimate ages using cores for 274 of those trees; the other cores were either lost (10 cores) 
or did not come close to the pith (21 cores) so we were not able to estimate age. 
Mean tree density ranged from 67.6 to 242.5 trees ha-l in the six sites, while basal 
area ranged from 16.3 to 34.5 m2 ha-I (Table 4.3). Snags were present in 10 of the 30 
plots, and snags per hectare values per site ranged from 3.6 to 15.6. We found only 7 cut 
stumps in our 30 plots, in sites 1,3, and 4. Stumps densities per site ranged from 0 to 5.9 
85

stumps ha-I . Seedling and sapling density ranged from 0-260 seedlings ha-I , and there 
was no correlation between seedling and sampling density and overstory tree density or 
basal area. The median tree height across all sites was 19.5 m, and there was a weak trend 
toward decreasing height with elevation; the correlation coefficient between height and 
elevation of plot center was -0.38. 
All sites were uneven-aged (Fig. 4.4). Site 3 was the only site where we did not 
have trees in our sample with center dates prior to 1880. However, we had one core from 
site 3 with an inner date of 1637; this core was broken off near the center and we were 
not able to estimate the center date of the tree. In the other sites, cores which we could 
not use for age estimation had inner dates ranging from 1719 to 1963. If we had been able 
to estimate center dates from these cores, in general they would have increased values in 
the older age classes. The tree size distribution mirrored the age distribution closely (Fig. 
4.5). Age and size of individual trees were highly correlated, with a correlation 
coefficient of 0.81 for all trees that were aged. 
Fuel loading was fairly low. Average litter depth ranged from 1.1 to 2.2 cm, and 
average duff depth ranged from 1.7 to 4.9 cm (Table 4.3). Total woody debris ranged 
from 1.5 to 13.4 mg ha -I. 
Fire-climate 
In the SEA analysis, winter NIN03 values tended to be below average during fire 
years, indicating a trend toward a fire relationship with La Nina events (Fig. 4.6). This 
trend was also apparent in the plotting of widespread fire years on the winter NIN03 
index over time (Fig. 4.7). However, the trends were not significant, and it appears that

widespread fires have occurred in both EI Niiio and La Niiia years in the past. No change 
could be observed in the 1830s due to the short fire record that we reconstructed. 
In 1902 and 1907, the years of most widespread fire across our sites, winter 
NIN03 values were close to average. Comparing a list of twentieth-century ENSO 
extremes (Stahle and Cleaveland 1993) with fire occurrence in our sites reveals that in 
extreme EI Niiio years of the 20th century (n=8), an average of 1.75 sites recorded fire, 
while in the extreme La Niiia years of the 20th century (n=9) an average of 0.89 sites 
recorded fire. The difference between the mean number of sites recording fire in extreme 
EI Niiio and extreme La Niiia years is close to significant (p=0.050). 
Discussion 
Not found: altered fire regime and degradation of the forest 
Changes to the fire regime 
Our first sub-hypothesis was that an increase in fire frequency occurred, that there 
was a change in fire type from surface fire to crown fire, and that there was a change in 
seasonality of fire. We did not find an increase in fire frequency during the period that we 
were able to analyze. However, it is possible that humans have been partially responsible 
for the very high number of fires over the past 150 years. Perhaps Lauer and Klaus's 
(1975) assessment that humans had increased fire frequency was correct but the influence 
has been felt much longer than over the past half-century. Mean fire intervals in this 
forest of P. hartwegii were much shorter than mean fire intervals found in P. hartwegii 
forest farther north in Mexico (Yocom et al. 2010). If the P. hartwegii population in Pico

de Orizaba National Park has adapted to an evolutionary environment that was 
characterized by as frequent fire as we documented in the past 150 years, it is possible 
that different fire frequencies in different populations of P. hartwegii have contributed to 
the genetic differentiation among populations found by Schaal and Leverich (1996). The 
interaction of disturbance regimes and genetic divergence in geographically isolated 
populations would be an interesting avenue for further research. 
The fire scar record indicates that fires were usually very small and asynchronous. 
When the 2-scar filter was used, between 14 and 55% of fire dates were eliminated from 
the analysis, depending on the site. The very small size of many fires suggests that they 
are probably not fires that have escaped from agricultural burns on the slopes below. 
Human-started fires in agricultural fields below the timberline would be more likely to 
fan out as they spread upslope and scar more trees, although this is something for which 
we have no conclusive evidence. The small size of many fires is probably not due to 
limited fuel, given the abundant and continuous grasses, and we speculate that it could be 
due to the low partial pressure of oxygen at the altitude ofthe timberline. Controlled 
experimental burning at elevations ranging from 400 to 3000 m above sea level has 
indicated that fires develop more slowly at high altitude (Wieser et al. 1997) and 
experimental burning at 50 m and 3658 m above sea level indicated that burning rate, 
radiation heat flux, and flame temperature are lower at high altitude than at low altitude 
(Li et al. 2009). Perhaps burning conditions, including fuel moisture and temperature, are 
also not normally ideal for fire spread. 
The overwhelming majority of scars in our sites were formed on ring boundaries, 
when trees were dormant. Most of our samples, collected in April and May, did not have

any current-year ring growth yet, meaning that donnancy in wood growth lasts through at 
least the beginning of May. This means that donnant-period fires could have occurred in 
any month from the fall, when trees enter donnancy, through approximately May. 
Because the vast majority of fire scars were fonned in the donnant season, we were not 
able to assess whether humans or other factors changed the seasonality of most fires from 
immediately before the rainy season to earlier in the dry season. 
We did not find evidence of high-severity fire in the area that we worked based on 
patterns of mortality or past pulses of even-aged regeneration. This is in contrast to P. 
hartwegii forests in the Sierra Madre Oriental, where we found clusters of pith dates in 
fire-scarred samples that could be evidence for small patches of high-severity disturbance 
that opened up growing space for pulses of recruitment (Yocom et al. 2010, Yocom et al. 
in prep.). In the present study, tree center dates did not appear to be episodic but instead 
were fairly steady through time. 
To summarize the evidence related to our first sub-hypothesis, we did not find 
evidence of an increase in fire frequency, although we found that fires were very frequent 
through time; we were not able to assess whether humans have changed the seasonality of 
most fires because almost all scars were fonned in the donnant period; and we found no 
evidence of crown fire in our sites. We cannot conclude that humans have not changed 
the fire regime at all, because fire frequency and/or seasonality may have changed prior 
to the twentieth century. However, humans have not changed the dominant fire type from 
surface fire to crown fire in our study area. 
Although we did not see an increase in fire frequency during the period we 
analyzed, we did note a decrease in fire frequency in the last decade. We do not know if 
89

the drop in fire frequency is due to increased fire suppression or decreased human-caused 
ignitions. In the mid-1990s a telescope was built on Sierra Negra, and with that came 
people who monitor the telescope full time. Also, although Pico de Orizaba National Park 
was officially designated a national park in 1937, it did not have management until 2004. 
Since 2004, an effort has been made to extinguish fires immediately when they start. 
Forest degradation 
Our second sub-hypothesis was related to forest degradation through increased 
fire frequency: that high mortality has occurred and there is little regeneration. Our 
results do not support this hypothesis. The forest in our study area has been unaffected by 
timber harvest, severe fire, or other major disturbances. We found old, large trees in 
every site, few snags, and no evidence of fire-caused mortality of overstory trees. Abella 
et al. (2007) gave examples of change that affect old-growth, frequent-fire forests of the 
western United States: fire exclusion, increased fire severity, livestock grazing, 
fragmentation, watershed disruption, large-tree removal, road building, fuelwood harvest, 
predator control, exotic plants, urban development, and climate change. Of these, we saw 
evidence only for road building, although it is not extensive, and some timber cutting, 
also not extensive. Climate change is also a potential factor of change in these forests that 
we did not measure. 
Regeneration varied substantially among sites and among plots. Measured values 
of seedling density range from 0 to 260 seedlings per hectare, and all plots together 
averaged 113.3 seedlings per hectare. The data reflect the patchiness of regeneration that 
occurred everywhere throughout our sites. In addition, there is a peak of small, young 
90

trees in the size and age distributions from our sites. Estimating mortality rates compared 
to regeneration rates can provide a benchmark of whether regeneration is sufficient to 
replace mortality. In the simplest calculation (see Mast et al. 1999), maintenance of 119 
treeslha (±20%) in a distribution with a maximum age of270 years (±20%) predicts a 
mortality rate range of 3.0 - 6.5 trees ha -I decade -I. Tree establishment rates in the 
1990s and 2000s were well above that mortality rate (9.6 and 11.3 trees ha -I decade -I) 
but were lower in the 1970s and 1980s (1.7 trees ha -I decade -I in both decades). 
Although the 1970s and 1980s had low establishment, overall our results suggest that, 
contrary to our second sub-hypothesis, forest degradation as we defined it here has not 
occurred in our sites: we found low mortality, the presence of old large, trees, and 
sustained recruitment over time evidenced by the presence of trees in every age category 
beginning in 1740. 
Forest sustainability 
Our third sub-hypothesis was related to forest sustainability: that current forest 
structure, demographics, or fuel loads put the forest at risk from severe disturbance. 
Forest structure characteristics in our sites are comparable to characteristics of other old-
growth fire-adapted conifer forests that have not been subjected to fire exclusion. The 
Sierra San Pedro Martir (SSPM) in northern Baja California, Mexico, is an example 
(Stephens and Gill 2005). Live tree density on Pico de Orizaba (average across all sites) 
was 119.2 trees ha-I , slightly less than the 145.3 trees ha-I reported in the SSPM. Basal 
area in our sites averaged 23.9 m2 ha-I, slightly more than the 19.9 m2 ha-I reported in the 
SSPM (Stephens and Gill 2005). Canopy cover in our sites in Pico de Orizaba National

Park ranged from 32 to 52%, which can be characterized as moderate canopy cover. In 
the SSPM, Stephens et al. found an average canopy cover of 26.8% (Stephens et al. 
2007). 
The size and age distributions of the forest were similar to each other, with a peak 
in the middle-sized and middle-aged regions and another peak in the small, young tree 
range. The relatively high density of small, young trees is found in most forests, and the 
forest age and size distributions may have been very similar throughout the past century. 
However, the high density of young, small trees may also be related to the unusual lack 
of fire in the 2000s and to some degree in the 1990s. Many of the small young trees 
established prior to the recent drop in fire frequency, but the recent lull in fire may be 
helping them to survive (Mast and Wolf2004, Brown and Wu 2005). Overall, the forest 
that we measured has an uneven-aged distribution with populations of old, middle-aged, 
and young trees. This suggests that the population is demographically stable and is 
unlikely to be at risk of a popUlation crash or irruption due to demographic imbalances. 
Fuels in our study area were fairly light. This is expected, given the frequent fire 
regime that characterized our study areas. Coarse woody debris tends to be lower in areas 
with a continued fire regime (Stephens et al. 2007). We can conclude that our third 
hypothesis regarding forest sustainability is not supported; the intrinsic characteristics of 
the forest itself, including forest demographics, structure, and fuels do not put the forest 
at risk of negative impacts from disturbance. 
Quantitative measurements of the fire regime and forest structure do not support 
Lauer and Klaus's assessment in the 1970s; it appears that humans have not altered the 
fire regime during the time period we could assess, or caused forest degradation.

However, it should be stressed that we studied a small portion of the timberline between 
Pico de Orizaba and Sierra Negra. We chose our study area because one of our goals was 
to find old trees and old wood in order to extend the climate-fire record as far back as 
possible. In our exploration of the park, we did see evidence of more timber cutting and 
patchy high-severity fire on the north side of Pico de Orizaba, and the trees appeared to 
be younger. The north side of the mountain should be further explored; the hypothesis 
that human-caused fires have altered the fire regime and degraded the forest might be 
supported there. This study should be regarded as a first step in understanding the 
dynamics of climate, fire, and human activities in Pico de Orizaba National Park and the 
eastern Trans-volcanic Belt. 
Not found: ENSO events associated with fire 
Inter-annual climatic variability was not a strong driver of fire occurrence at this 
location. Small fires were recorded in 90 of 100 years in the twentieth century, indicating 
that climate conditions were almost always suitable for burning. Our first sub-hypothesis, 
that El Nifio events are associated with fire events, was not supported. Neither El Nifio 
nor La Nifia events were significantly associated with fire. There was a weak trend in the 
SEA results towards an association between fire and La Nifia. On the other hand, a 
slightly higher number of sites recorded fire, on average, during the extreme El Nifio 
events during the twentieth century than during the extreme La Nifia events. 
During the strong El Nifio event of 1998, central and southern Mexico 
experienced a record number of fires. It was also a record year in terms of area and 
biomass burned, smoke released, cost of suppression, and firefighter lives lost

(Rodriguez-Trejo and Pyne 1999, Duncan et al. 2003). In our study area in Pico de 
Orizaba National Park, most samples in site 5 were scarred in 1998. However, 1997 was 
a big fire year in site 2 and 1999 was a big fire year in sites 1, 4, and 6. Clearly the EI 
Nino event of 1998, which synchronized fires across much of Mexico, did not 
synchronize fire events within our sites in Pico de Orizaba National Park. Our results, 
indicating that fires are not conclusively associated with EI Nino or even with ENSO, 
were unexpected given that in southern Mexico EI Nino events tend to be associated with 
below-average precipitation (Fig. 4.1) and above-average fire occurrence. 
We were not able to test our second sub-hypothesis, that ENSO events have been 
consistently related to fire occurrence over time, because our fire scar record did not 
extend back past the 1830s, the time period we documented a change in ENSO-fire 
relationships in the Sierra Madre Oriental. Although one of our objectives in selecting 
sites was to locate areas with old trees and old wood in order to allow the extension of the 
fire-climate record back in time, we did not find very much old wood with conserved fire 
scars. This may be related to the very high frequency of fires in the study area; remnant 
wood is probably difficult to find because it has been consumed by frequent fire over the 
centuries. 
High-elevation forests around the world are threatened by human impacts and 
climate change; additionally, in central Mexico, relatively undisturbed forests are rare. 
The forests in our sites on Pico de Orizaba continued to coexist with very frequent fire 
through the twentieth century, probably ignited by both lightning and humans. During the 
last decade, fire occurrence has abruptly diminished. It is our hope that information from 
this study will support planning and decision-making by managers, scientists, and

government officials; our findings can be used for management and conservation in the 
Park and in other similar ecosystems. Because very frequent fire has not degraded the 
forest over the past century and it is possible that the forest has adapted to this frequent 
fire regime over millennia, the historical disturbance regime should be allowed to 
continue as much as possible to maintain these rare and valuable forests' capacity for 
resilience in the face of climate change.

CHAPTER 5: CLIMATE AND LAND-USE DRIVERS OF HISTORICAL FIRES 
IN NORTHERN MEXICO 
Abstract 
We investigated the influence of climate on the occurrence of fire in northern Mexico. 
Using a network of 52 sites in 5 regions in the Sierra San Pedro Martir, the Sierra Madre 
Occidental, and the Sierra Madre Oriental, we compared across-region and within-region 
fire synchrony with climate oscillations including EI Niiio Southern Oscillation (ENSO), 
Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), as well 
as combinations of these oscillations. We also compared dates of fire regime disruption 
across northern Mexico. Across-region fires in northern Mexico were more likely to 
occur during negative (La Niiia) phases of EN SO and cool phases ofPDO, and fire was 
significantly more likely to occur during the combination of the cool phases of ENSO and 
PD~ than expected. AMO was not significantly associated with fire occurrence. In four 
of the five regions, La Niiia phases of EN SO were significantly associated with fire 
occurrence, and in three regions fires were significantly associated with previous-year EI 
Niiio conditions. We found that dates of fire regime interruption across northern Mexico 
were highly variable within and among regions. This suggests that human land use 
change is the strong driver of fire regime interruption, and climate played little or no role 
in the widespread cessation of fire across much of western North America in the 
nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

Introduction 
EI Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a climatic oscillation that affects fire 
patterns throughout western North and South America (e.g. Swetnam and Betancourt 
1990, Kitzberger et al. 2001, Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003, Fule et al. 2005). Recently, 
climate phenomena that oscillate on longer time scales, such as the Pacific Decadal 
Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), have been shown to 
interact with ENSO to reinforce or dampen historical fire occurrence patterns (Hessl et al. 
2004, Schoennagel et al. 2005, Taylor and Beaty 2005, Sibold and Veblen 2006, 
Schoennagel et al. 2007). Warmer spring temperatures have been associated with an 
increase in fire activity across the western United States in the twentieth century 
(We sterling et al. 2006), and projections of further increases in temperature suggest a 
further increase in fire occurrence in the future (We sterling et al. 2006, Seager et al. 
2007). To predict how current and future climate change will impact fire activity in 
western North America, it is necessary to explore historical climate-fire relationships at 
multiple scales across the region. 
In the United States, regional-scale analyses of climate-fire relationships have 
been completed for the Southwest (e.g. Swetnam 1990, Swetnam and Betancourt 1990, 
Swetnam and Baisan 1996, Grissino-Mayer and Swetnam 2000), the Northwest (e.g. 
Hessl et al. 2004, Heyerdahl et al. 2008a), the northern Rockies (e.g. Heyerdahl et al. 
2008b), and Utah (Brown et al. 2008), as well as a few studies at the scale of western 
North America (e.g. Kitzberger et al. 2001, Kitzberger et al. 2007, Trouet et al. 2010). 
Most of these studies are limited to analyzing climate-fire relationships before the 20th 
century, because in much of the United States fire regimes were interrupted in the mid- to 
110

late-nineteenth century by human influence, including livestock grazing and other land-
use changes (Belsky and Blumenthal 1997, Heyerdahl et al. 2001, Hessl et al. 2004). To 
overcome the anthropogenic influence of the twentieth century and extend understanding 
of the historical relationships between climate and fire in North America, at least in part, 
we can look to northern Mexico. Human impacts in the mountains of northern Mexico 
followed a different history than the United States or Canada, with large-scale livestock 
introduction largely deferred until post-revolutionary land reforms in the mid-twentieth 
century. Comprehensive fire suppression was never achieved in some areas (Leopold 
1937, Rodriguez-Trejo and Fule 2003). Heyerdahl and Alvarado (2003) suggested that 
fire exclusion was closely associated with the formation of ejidos, which are lands held in 
common and managed by local people with the input of the government. When ejidos 
were granted as part of land reform in the early to mid twentieth century, fire regimes 
may have changed due to increased livestock grazing, road building, logging, and 
changing the traditional role of fire (Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003). Although some sites 
experienced fire exclusion in the late 1800s, long before the formation of ejidos (Yocom 
et al. in prep.), and fire regimes at many sites were interrupted around the time of ejido 
formation (Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003), other sites have fires continuing to the present 
(FuM et al. in press). Due to the existence of many sites that did not experience fire 
exclusion until the mid-twentieth century and the presence of sites that have had 
continued fire regimes up to the present, Mexican forests comprise the most intact 
contemporary data source in North America for examining climate-fire interactions. 
A network of fire history sites has been developed in northern Mexico over the 
past several decades, many of which have been used to explore fire-climate relationships 
111

as well as historical fire regimes. Northern Mexico is strongly affected by ENSO (Stahle 
and Cleaveland 1993), but ENSO links to fire occurrence have been studied only at the 
scale of individual sites or within mountain ranges. In the Sierra Madre Occidental in 
northwestern Mexico, past La Nina events were typically associated with the year of fire 
occurrence (Fule and Covington 1999, Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003, Fule et al. 2005). 
However, in the southern part of the Sierra Madre Occidental, Drury and Veblen (2008) 
found that there was not a significant relationship between La Nina events and fire years 
but instead there was a significant lag relationship between El Nino and fire, with El Nino 
conditions typically occurring one year before fire years. In addition, dry conditions 
prevailing in fire years and wet conditions lagged one year prior to fire events were also 
common in northern Mexico (Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003, Fule et al. 2005), as they are 
in the southwestern US (Swetnam and Baisan 2003). In the Sierra San Mfu1:ir, located in 
Baja California, fue years were associated with La Nina conditions and also with a 
shifting of phase of the PD~ (Skinner 2007). In the Sierra Madre Oriental, in 
northeastern Mexico, fire occurrence was associated with La Nina conditions, but in one 
area the relationship changed over time and La Nina was no longer associated with fire 
after the 1830s (Yocom et al. 2010). It is likely that ENSO, PD~, and AMO affected the 
occurrence of fire across northern Mexico. However, only now are new data sets being 
completed that expand the network to eastern Mexico (Yocom et al. 2010) and northern 
Chihuahua (Fule et al. in press), and a large-scale analysis of interactions between these 
climate factors and fire has not been completed for this part of west em North America.

Our objectives were to analyze the relationships between climate oscillations 
(ENSO, PDO, and AMO) and regionally synchronous fire years and to describe patterns 
of fire exclusion dates and their variability in sites across northern Mexico. 
Methods 
Study Area 
We included all fire-history sites in northern Mexico for which we had data. The 
52 sites included were originally sampled as individual research projects (Table 5.1; Ful6 
and Covington 1997, Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003, Ful6 et al. 2005, Cerano unpublished 
data, FuIe unpublished data, Yocom unpublished data, Skinner 2007, Yocom et al. 2010, 
Ful6 et al. in press). The sites extend geographically from northern Baja California in the 
west, east to the Sierra Madre Oriental, north in the Sierra Madre Occidental to close to 
the U.S.-Mexico border, and south in the Sierra Madre Occidental to southern Durango 
(Fig. 5.1). All sites were north of the Tropic of Cancer and north of the dipole where the 
relationship between ENSO and precipitation changes. All sites were at 1950 m above 
sea level or higher and were forested. Tree species sampled in the sites varied across 
regions; they included Abies vejarii, Pinus arizonica, Pinus ayacahuite, Pinus 
durangensis, Pinus engelmannii, Pinus hartwegii, Pinus herrerai, Pinus jeffreyii, Pinus 
leiophylla, Pinus lumholtzii, Pinus strobiformis, Pinus teocote, and Pseudotsuga 
menziesii. 
Fire chronologies 
Fire chronologies were assembled from the IMPD or contributed by the original 
investigators. At each site, fire-scar data was sampled in an area ranging from 2 to 70 ha, 
113

and the number of crossdated fire-scarred tree samples from each site ranged from 6 to 54 
(Table 5.1). We identified fire years at each site as those with scars on ~2 trees, and these 
dates were compiled into site chronologies. 
We divided the 52 sites into five regions, called Baja, Occidental North, 
Occidental Central, Occidental South, and Oriental (Fig. 5.1), to determine whether each 
region had different climate drivers of fire. We identified within-region synchronous fire 
years as those in which sites within each region recorded fire most synchronously. To do 
this, we aimed for a similar number of within-region synchronous fire years for each 
region, rather than defining a set number or percentage of sites recording fire, because 
each region had different numbers of sites and levels of synchrony (for example, Baja 
sites were very asynchronous and there were only 2 years when 5 sites recorded fire, but 
in Occidental South there were 23 years when 5 or more sites recorded fire). This 
approach resulted in a set of within-region synchronous fire years for each of the five 
regions, numbering 27,21,23, 19, and 31 in Baja, Occidental North, Occidental Central, 
Occidental South, and Oriental respectively. 
We also identified across-region synchronous fire years as those when 4 or 5 
regions recorded fire synchronously. We identified no-fire years as those when 0 regions 
recorded a fire, and we also identified years when 1,2, or 3 regions recorded a fire.

We graphically and statistically compared our fire chronologies to independently 
derived tree-ring reconstructions of large-scale climate oscillations to assess potential 
climate forcing. We used the following reconstructions: winter NIN03 (December

through February) SST index (Cook 2000), annual PD~ (D'Arrigo et al. 2001), and 
annual AMO (Gray et al. 2004). To address temporal autocorrelation in the NIN03 
index, we fit autoregressive integrated moving average models based on lowest Akaike's 
information criterion and significant but uncorrelated parameter estimates (Brown et al. 
2008) and used the resulting white noise residuals in our analyses. 
To evaluate the influence of climate drivers on fire occurrence at our study sites, 
we used superposed epoch analysis (SEA) in FHX2 (Grissino-Mayer 1995) to compare 
fire occurrence with climate indices including NIN03, PD~, and AMO. The SEA 
compared climate index values during fire years, five years prior to fire years, and two 
years after fire years. To assess statistical significance of the SEA results, we calculated 
95% confidence intervals using bootstrapped distributions of climate data in 1000 trials. 
We assessed the influence of two-way and three-way combinations ofthe phases 
of AMO, PD~, and ENSO on fire occurrence in northern Mexico. We used i goodness-
of-fit tests (a=0.05) to compare the expected fire occurrence with observed fire 
occurrence to determine whether fires occurred disproportionately during particular phase 
combinations oflarge-scale climate oscillations (positive and negative phases of AMO, 
PD~, and ENSO). Expected values in each phase combination were calculated from the 
proportion of years from 1750-1978 in each of the combinations, and observed values 
were the number of across-region fire years in each phase combination. 
Although the first fire in the sites was in 1438 and the last fire was in 2003, we 
analyzed the relationship between climate oscillations and fire across regions in the 
period from 1750 to 1978. We chose 1750 as a starting date for the climate-fire analysis 
because 35 of the 52 sites were recording at that time and all 5 regions had recorded at 
115

least one fire date before 1750, meaning that all 5 regions had the potential to contribute 
to regional fire years. We chose 1978 as an ending date for the climate-fire analysis 
because the period of overlap in the climate reconstructions we used ends in 1978. 
Fire exclusion dates 
To assess the variability of fire exclusion dates in the 52 sites, we created a fire 
history graph from the composite (~2 fire scars) fire chronologies from each site and 
visually compared patterns offire exclusion across sites and regions. For each site, we 
designated a year that the fire regime was interrupted: either the last year that fire was 
recorded in a site or the last year that fire was recorded in a site before an 
uncharacteristically large fire interval. We grouped the fire regime interruption dates into 
20-year bins and graphed the results to assess patterns in fire regime interruption. We 
also graphed across-region synchronous fire dates on indices of EN SO, PD~, and AMO 
to look for changes in long-term climate patterns that could explain fire exclusion dates in 
northern Mexico. 
Results 
The 9 years of maximum synchrony of fire, when all 5 regions in northern 
Mexico recorded fire, were 1798, 1820, 1838, 1851, 1894, 1899, 1902, 1909, and 1917. 
There were an additional 36 years when 4 regions recorded fire, and we designated the 45 
years when 4+ regions recorded fire as across-region synchronous fire years (Fig. 5.2). 
Fires were recorded in only 1 region in 59 years, 2 regions in 61 years, and 3 regions in 
49 years. There were 45 years in which no fires were recorded in any of the regions.

ENSO was a significant driver of synchronous fire years. Average NIN03 values 
were significantly low in years when 3 or 4+ regions recorded fire, and significantly high 
in years when ° 
or 1 region recorded fire (Fig. 5.3). Antecedent NIN03 values were 
significantly high prior to years when 4+ regions recorded fire, and significantly low 
prior to years when only 1 region recorded fire (Fig. 5.3). Average NIN03 values were 
significantly low in within-region fire years in Baja, Occidental North, Occidental 
Central, and Oriental, but not significantly low in Occidental South (Fig. 5.4). ENSO in 
antecedent years was important in some analyses as well: NIN03 values were 
significantly above-average one year prior to fire years in all three Occidental regions but 
not in Baja or the Oriental (Fig. 5.4). Baja showed a significantly above average NIN03 
value 5 years prior to fire years. 
PDO was also a significant driver of synchronous fire years. Average PDO index 
values were significantly low in across-region synchronous fire years (Fig. 5.5). There 
were no significant relationships between PD~ and years when 0, 1, 2, or 3 regions 
recorded fire (not shown). Within regions, PD~ was significantly low during fire years in 
Occidental North and Oriental: within-region synchronous fire years in the other three 
regions were not significantly associated with PD~ (Fig. 5.5). AMO was not significantly 
correlated with fire years or no-fire years in any SEA analysis (not shown). 
In the two-way combinations, there was a trend toward more fires than expected 
when both the PD~ and ENSO were in negative phases (Fig. 5.6); the trend was very 
close to statistically significant. There were no combinations of AMO and PDO or AMO 
and ENSO in which observed fires were significantly different from expected. In the 
three-way combinations, there was a trend toward more fire than expected in the 
117

combinations where PDO and ENSO were both negative, especially when AMO was 
positive. Again, the Chi-square test for the three-way combinations was close to 
significant, but not significant. This result should be regarded with caution as more than 
20% of the cells in the contingency table had values lower than 5. 
A visual inspection of the fire history graph reveals high variability in when 
historical patterns of fire were interrupted (Fig. 5.2). Overall the Sierra Madre Oriental 
experienced fire regime interruption earliest of the five regions, although there is 
variation within the region, with fire interruption dates ranging from 1887 to 1962. In 
Baja California, fire regime interruption occurred in different sites between 1924 and 
1981, with most sites having their last fire between the 1930s and the 1960s. In 
Occidental North, most sites had their last fire or the last fire before a long break in fire 
between 1945 and 1955, with one site experiencing frequent fire to the present (site rt, 
last fire recorded 2002). In Occidental Central, several sites have uninterrupted fire 
regimes, with last fires recorded in the late 1990s and 2003. Other sites had a change in 
fire regime as early as 1929 and scattered throughout the subsequent decades. In 
Occidental South, fire regime interruption dates were again scattered, ranging from 1930 
through the subsequent decades. Two sites in this region (chi and aU) had a continuous 
record of fire up to the time that samples in those sites were collected. The graph of fire 
exclusion dates by region also shows that fire regime interruption dates, or dates of the 
last fire in uninterrupted sites, were spread throughout the twentieth century (Fig. 5.7). 
Within-region and across-region fire dates graphed on indices of EN SO, PDO, 
and AMO reveal no patterns of climate that can be related to fire exclusion in sites or 
regions of Mexico (Fig. 5.8). For example, the amplitude and frequency of EN SO

oscillations after the last within-region fire date (1956) do not appear to be different than 
before 1956. 
Discussion 
Synchronous fire years occurred in regions across northern Mexico frequently in 
the past. There were 45 years in which 4 or more regions recorded fire synchronously 
during the period of analysis, and there were also 45 years in which none of the regions 
recorded fire. 
We found a significant association between La Nina conditions (negative phase of 
ENSO) and across-region synchronous fire years (4+ regions), as well as a significant 
association between La Nina years and within-region synchronous fire years in four of 
the five regions. It is notable that within-region synchronous years in Occidental South 
were not significantly related to La Nina years; this is the same result that Drury and 
Veblen (2008) found in their study in this region. Drury and Veblen (2008) speculated 
that perhaps in the southern Sierra Madre Occidental other climatic drivers were more 
important. 
The positive phase of ENSO (EI Nino) was significantly associated with the year 
prior to across-region synchronous fire years as well as with the year prior to within-
region synchronous fire years in all three Sierra Madre Occidental regions. The previous-
year EI Nino association with fire occurrence has been found in many studies in the 
southwestern United States. EI Nino events, which tend to be associated with above-
average rainfall in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, can enhance the 
growth of grasses and forbs, which then provide the fine fuel necessary for fire to spread 
during the following year (Swetnam and Betancourt 1990). However, we did not find the 
119

association between previous-year EI Nino events and fire occurrence in the Baja and 
Oriental regions. This could be because fuel availability is not the limiting factor in the 
Baja and Oriental regions but rather low fuel moisture or ignitions are limiting. Fuel 
availability may not be a limiting factor as much in the Baja and Oriental regions because 
fires are less frequent than in the Sierra Madre Occidental regions (Fig. 5.2). Perhaps 
because there is more time on average for fuel to build up between fires, inter-annual 
precipitation variability and ensuing fuel build-up is not as important. On the other hand, 
in Baja, we found significantly above average NIN03 values five years prior to fire 
years. This result was also found by Skinner et al. (2008) in their analysis of this area. 
They speculated that the reason for this could be that needle production was enhanced 
during EI Nino years, and the dominant tree in the region, Pinus jeffreyii, retains its 
needles for 4-6 years. When the needles were cast from the conifers, sufficient fine fuel 
would be on the ground for a surface fire to spread. 
The PDO was a significant driver of fire synchrony at the scale of northern 
Mexico; across-region synchronous fires were significantly associated with the negative 
phase ofPDO. In addition, the Occidental North and the Oriental regions showed 
significant relationships between negative PDO values and within-region synchronous 
fire years. However, the other three regions did not. The influence of the PD~ was also 
seen in the contingency table analyses, where combined negative phases of the PDO and 
ENSO resulted in higher-than-expected occurrence of fire. The PD~ has also been shown 
to be a significant driver of fire in the western United States (Kitzberger et al. 2007), and 
in regional studies in the Pacific Northwest (Hessl et al. 2004, Heyerdahl et al. 2008a), 
western Colorado (Schoennagel et al. 2007), and Utah (Brown et al. 2008).

AMO did not appear to have a significant impact on synchrony across northern 
Mexico. The only result that suggested that AMO was potentially a driver of fire was the 
in the three-way phase combinations. While the combination of a negative PD~ and a 
negative ENSO resulted in higher-than-expected fire occurrence, it was highest when 
AMO was positive. However, the two-way combinations of AMO and PD~ and AMO 
and ENSO did not produce significantly different observed vs. expected values of fire, so 
the AMO influence cannot be confirmed. If we had a longer record of fire in all five 
regions, we might be able to better assess the influence of AMO. Much of the analysis 
period is in a period oflow AMO activity, and AMO may not have had a large influence 
on fire synchrony in that period. 
Fire regime interruption dates were highly variable across sites. The Sierra Madre 
Oriental had the earliest fire regime interruption dates and the Sierra Madre Occidental 
Central region had the largest number of sites with uninterrupted fire regimes continuing 
to the present. The variability in fire regime interruption dates and the presence of only 
one site in northern Mexico with a fire regime interruption date before 1900 is in stark 
contrast to the southwestern United States, where fire regimes were typically interrupted 
between about 1870 and 1900 (Swetnam and Baisan 2003) due to the introduction of 
livestock (Belsky and Blumenthal 1997), other land use changes, and subsequent fire 
suppression policies. 
The variability in fire regime interruption dates across northern Mexico strongly 
supports the idea that human land use, including livestock grazing, timber and fuel wood 
harvesting, and road building are the driving force behind changing fire regimes in 
western North America. If the changes were due to climate, the changes would be more 
121

synchronous across sites and regions. This is in contrast to findings from a recent study in 
southern Nevada, where a mainly climatic explanation was found for reduced fire 
frequency in the last century (Biondi et al. 2011). In northern Mexico, local land use 
history among sites is the likely reason for the variability in fire interruption dates. For 
example, the three sites at Pino Gordo, which have continuing fire up to the present, are 
very difficult to access, and internal political struggles have kept logging from occurring 
in these sites (Fule et al. in press). In other sites, fire interruption was coincident with the 
formation of ejidos (Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003). In La Michilia Biosphere Reserve, 
the previous owner of the land was a rancher with 7,000 cows (Fule and Covington 
1999). In contrast to the western United States, where a wave of settlers, livestock, and 
railways washed across much of the territory before 1900 and changed the fire regime of 
widespread areas within a short period of time, many sites in Mexico have their own 
individual story of land use, human interaction, and fire regime change. 
Climate was a strong influence on fire regimes across northern Mexico 
historically. Given that climate variability affected fire occurrence in the past, future 
climate change could also affect fire occurrence. The climate in the Southwest and 
northern Mexico is projected to become more arid in the near future, with this transition 
potentially already underway (Seager et al. 2007). Drier conditions are conducive to fire 
occurrence, but fine fuel production may limit fire in a more arid environment. Longer, 
warmer summers have been linked to more fires in the western United States (We sterling 
et al. 2006), and the same relationship probably exists in northern Mexico as well. 
Additionally, although climate change is bound to change ENSO, it is difficult to predict 
exactly how (Fedorov and Philander 2000, Tudhope and Collins 2003). As our climate

change projections improve and our understanding of how climate change will impact 
global climate oscillations develops, explorations of historical climate-fire relationships 
may be useful in providing insight into how fire occurrence will change in the future.

CHAPTER 6: CONCLUSION AND MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS 
This dissertation has documented a range of influences on fire occurrence in eastern and 
northern Mexico. Climate is important over long time periods and broad scales, but it can 
also influence the probability of fire occurrence at individual sites. Fine-scale factors, 
including topography, elevation, aspect, slope, and forest species composition are 
important influences on fire regimes and can interrupt synchrony between closely spaced 
sites. Finally, humans are an important component when considering influences on fire in 
Mexico too; humans have been influential in causing fire exclusion and have also been an 
important ignition source of fires. 
Currently, people account for the majority of fire starts (up to 90%) in Mexico, 
and the main reason fires are started is to improve agricultural and pasture areas 
(Rodriguez-Trejo 2008). People have used fire to meet various objectives in Mexico for 
millennia; it has been speculated that human-caused fires may even have played a role 
over evolutionary time in pine forests of Mexico (Rodriguez-Trejo and Fule 2003). 
Today there are three categories of pine forests in Mexico, according to 
Rodriguez-Trejo and Fule (2003): 1) forests with 'excessive' human-caused fire which is 
contributing to deforestation and degradation, 2) forests maintained by natural or 
anthropogenic fires, with fire regimes similar to fire regimes of the past centuries, and 3) 
forests where fire exclusion has allowed fuel buildup to occur or successional change to 
take place, leading to high risk of severe wildfire. 
In the three fire history chapters in this dissertation, there are examples of both the 
second and third category of forest described by Rodriguez-Trejo and Fule (2003). At 
Pena Nevada, a severe wildfire deforested much of the peak in 1998; it is likely that a

large amount of fuel buildup during fire exclusion since the 1920s, along with a severe 
climate event (the extreme 1998 EI Nino), contributed to the severity of the fire. In our 
sites in the northern Sierra Madre Oriental, fire exclusion began as early as 1887; the 
forests in those sites are probably at high risk of a high-severity fire if a fire starts during 
extreme fire weather. Only at Pico de Orizaba did we find a forest that experienced many 
fires throughout the 20th century and has an open, low-density structure. However, in that 
location, in the 21 5t century fire frequency has slowed either due to fire suppression or 
lack of continued frequent human ignitions. We did not work in areas where excessive 
human-caused fire has degraded the forest or caused deforestation. 
Rodriguez-Trejo has written that integrated fire management with the goal of 
maximizing positive impacts of fire and minimizing negative impacts of fire is necessary 
in Mexico (Rodriguez-Trejo 2008). Positive impacts of fire include maintenance of 
biological diversity, plant regeneration, tree growth, nutrient and organic matter 
recycling, maintenance of wildlife habitat, and improved pasture. Negative impacts 
include risk for firefighters, people, and property, deforestation, erosion, pollution, tree 
and wildlife mortality, catastrophic fire danger, extremely frequent fires, and economic 
impacts (Rodriguez-Trejo 2008). 
In forests ofPefia Nevada, the northern Sierra Madre Oriental, and Pico de 
Orizaba, where fires were historically frequent and the forests are fire-adapted, a policy 
of strict fire suppression is unwise and instead I recommend integrated fire management, 
as described by Rodriguez-Trejo. Although negative risks to property, safety, and natural 
resources must be considered, reintroducing fire at Pefia Nevada and the northern Sierra 
Madre Oriental, and allowing frequent fire to continue at Pico de Orizaba are

management options that should be considered. The lessons learned in the American 
Southwest, where billions of dollars are needed to restore forests altered by more than a 
century of fire exclusion, should be applied where fire exclusion has taken place in fire-
adapted forests. Mexico is seeing a slow rise in the use of prescribed fire in appropriate 
situations (Rodriguez-Trejo and Fule 2003), and hopefully this trend will continue where 
appropriate. 
This dissertation documented the importance of climate as an influence on fire 
over the past several centuries. Given that climate variability affected fire occurrence in 
the past, future climate change could also affect fire occurrence. As our climate change 
projections improve and our understanding of how climate change will impact global 
climate oscillations develops, explorations of historical climate-fire relationships may be 
useful in providing insight into how fire occurrence will change in the future.
