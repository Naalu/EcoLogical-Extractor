Southwestern ponderosa pine forest ecosystems have become uncharacteristically dense as a result of
intensive livestock grazing, logging, and ﬁre exclusion, which have contributed to a buildup of fuels
and increased vulnerability to high-severity, landscape-scale crown ﬁres. In 2002, we implemented a
replicated ecological restoration experiment to (1) quantify site-speciﬁc reference conditions, (2) analyze
effects of elevation on forest structure, surface fuels, and canopy fuels, (3) test responses to three
treatments: control, full treatment, and burn-only, and (4) evaluate effectiveness of treatments for
restoring attributes to near historical reference conditions. Reconstructed reference conditions showed
that basal area (BA) averaged 9.2 m2 ha1 and tree density averaged 86.2 trees ha1 across the site in
1880 prior to widespread ﬁre exclusion, with the highest tree density values occurring at the two
upper elevation sites. In 2002, prior to treatment, BA averaged 28.9 m2 ha1 and density averaged
927.9 trees ha1, representing three- and ten-fold increases, respectively, compared to 1880 values with
a higher proportion of the increase coming from mesic species at higher elevations. By 2013 (5-years
post-treatment), the full treatment showed BA was reduced by 52% compared to pre-treatment values
from 31 m2 ha1 to 15 m2 ha1 and density was reduced by 85% from 998 trees ha1 to 153 trees ha1.
In the burn-only treatment, BA increased by 6% from 27.5 m2 ha1 to 29.1 m2 ha1 although density
was reduced by 25% from 837 trees ha1 to 625 trees ha1 between 2002 and 2013. Canopy fuels
dynamics were similar to forest structure responses: low values prior to ﬁre exclusion, a marked increase
by the pre-treatment measurement, substantial reductions following thinning plus burning, and minor
reductions following burn-only treatments. Post-treatment diameter distributions in the full treatment
closely resembled reference conditions; minor reductions occurred in the lower diameter classes in
the burn-only. Mortality of trees established before European settlement circa 1880 varied by treatment:
25% of presettlement trees alive in 2002 died by 2013 in the full treatment, 31% died in the burn-only
treatment, and 15% died in the control. Of the treatments tested, the full treatment was the only one that
rapidly shifted forest structure, diameter distributions, and canopy fuels values to levels near or within
the historical reference conditions. Results from this study showed that managers will have to consider
tradeoffs between alternative treatments in the context of climate-induced, landscape-scale forest ﬁres.

1. Introduction
Southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C.
Lawson var. brachyptera (Engelm.) Lemmon) forest ecosystems
have become uncharacteristically dense and structurally homoge-
neous over the last century as a result of intensive livestock grazing,
logging, and ﬁre exclusion following Euro-American settlement in
the late 1800s (Cooper, 1960; Covington et al., 1997). Changes in
historical surface ﬁre regimes and forest structural characteristics
have contributed to a buildup of fuels and increased vulnerability
to
high-severity,
landscape-scale
crown
ﬁres
and
epidemic
pathogenic outbreaks (Allen et al., 2002; Parker et al., 2006;
Negrón et al., 2009), similar to changes in fuels and ﬁre severity
in
California
(Miller
et
al.,
2009),
the
Paciﬁc
Northwest
(Youngblood et al., 2004), and Mediterranean Basin (Pausas,
2004). The two largest wildﬁres in Arizona recorded history – the
2002 Rodeo–Chediski ﬁre (189,651 ha) and the 2011 Wallow ﬁre

(217,741 ha total, 211,506 ha in Arizona) – occurred in the White
Mountains of east-central Arizona (InciWeb.nwcg.gov). In addition
to the loss of critical wildlife habitat and old/large trees, and the
possibility that previously forested areas may experience type
conversion (Savage and Mast, 2005; Roccaforte et al., 2012), these
‘‘mega-ﬁres’’ resulting from anthropogenic changes in forest
structure and warm, dry climate conditions have cost an estimated
$465 million to date including ﬁre suppression, loss of property, and
rehabilitation
(Western
Forestry
Leadership
Coalition,
2010;
Peterson, 2012).
In forests that evolved with frequent, low-severity ﬁre, stands
that are relatively open with low fuel loads are more likely to be
resilient to disturbances under future climate conditions than
those that have high tree density and fuel loads (Fulé, 2008). In
recent decades, managers have implemented a variety of restora-
tion and fuels treatments in degraded forests to restore ecological
integrity and increase resilience to disturbances, such as high-
severity crown ﬁres and insect outbreaks (Covington et al., 1997;
Lynch et al., 2000; Youngblood et al., 2006; Fajardo et al., 2007;
Stephens et al., 2009; Roccaforte et al., 2010). Fuels reduction
and restoration treatments found to be effective include manipula-
tions to individual trees, such as raking and pruning (Schmidt and
Wakimoto, 1988), treatments focused on protecting old/large trees
(Fulé et al., 2006), mechanical thinning without burning (Agee and
Skinner, 2005), and strategic placement of fuelbreaks (Agee et al.,
2000; Finney, 2001).
Treatments based on the principles of ecological restoration aim
to assist the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded,
damaged, or destroyed (SER, 2004). The use of reference condi-
tions, qualitative and quantitative attributes describing the system
prior to degradation, serves not only as the model for planning the
restoration project, but also for its evaluation following treatment
implementation
(Moore
et
al.,
1999;
SER,
2004).
Reference
conditions often incorporate information from various sources,
including historical photos and written accounts, original land sur-
vey records, dendrochronological stand reconstructions, and ﬁre
history studies (Egan and Howell, 2001). In frequent-ﬁre forests,
restoration treatments require the removal of smaller/younger
trees followed by the reintroduction of the frequent surface ﬁre
regime (Moore et al., 1999). Prescriptions for ecological restoration
treatments are designed to produce conditions that emulate the
structural variability, spatial patterns, and processes that were
present prior to the disruption of the primary disturbance agent,
ﬁre. One method for achieving site-speciﬁc structural characteristics
in ponderosa pine forest restoration is to utilize remnant evidence
remaining in the ﬁeld such as old trees, logs, stumps, and snags to
guide restoration prescriptions (Roccaforte et al., 2010).
Prescribed burning without prior thinning is one of the most
widely applied management tools for reducing fuels and crown
ﬁre hazard, especially in areas where mechanical treatments can-
not be implemented due to access, slope, or economic limitations
(Reynolds et al., 2013). For example, burn-only treatments (both
prescribed burning and managed wildﬁre) are the primary method
for reducing fuels and ﬁre hazard in national parks and wilderness
areas where mechanical treatments are restricted (Stephenson,
1999; Holden et al., 2006). Prescribed ﬁre treatments without prior
thinning were implemented in frequent-ﬁre forests beginning in
the mid-20th century as foresters and ecologists attempted to
restore ﬁre’s natural role after decades of ﬁre exclusion (Weaver,
1952; 1957). However, negative effects of ‘‘burn-only’’ treatments
have been documented, including increased mortality of presettle-
ment trees due to cambial girdling (Sackett et al., 1996), lethal soil
temperatures under presettlement trees (Covington and Sackett,
1990),
and
prescribed
ﬁres
that
have
escaped
containment
(Dether and Black, 2006). Although ﬁre behavior in unthinned
forests
may
be
unpredictable
and
difﬁcult
to
control
(Zimmerman, 2003), burn-only treatments can have positive eco-
logical results by reducing fuels and restoring forest structure
(Fulé et al., 2004; Laughlin et al., 2011; Fulé et al., 2012).
To test alternative approaches for restoring degraded ponderosa
pine forests, we implemented an experiment in east-central Ari-
zona. The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify site-speciﬁc
reference conditions using dendroecological reconstruction meth-
ods, (2) analyze effects of elevation on historical and contemporary
changes in forest structure and canopy fuels, (3) compare effects of
alternative restoration treatments on stand structure, surface fuels,
and canopy fuels, and (4) evaluate effectiveness of treatments for
restoring attributes to near historical reference conditions.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study site
The study site (latitude 34100N, longitude 109380W) is located
within the Mineral Ecosystem Management Area (EMA) in east-
central Arizona on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests. The site
has a north aspect with slopes ranging between 0% and 27%.
Elevations range from approximately 2340–2580 m, spanning an
elevation gradient from the ponderosa – pinyon-juniper (P. edulis
– Juniperus sp.) ecotone to the ponderosa – dry mixed conifer
ecotone. Overstory tree species present include: ponderosa pine,
Gambel oak, alligator, oneseed, and Utah juniper, pinyon pine,
southwestern white pine, Douglas-ﬁr, white ﬁr, and aspen (see
Table 1 for scientiﬁc names of species). Shrub species present
include: wax current (Ribes cereum), Woods’ rose (Rosa woodsii),
and Fendler’s ceanothus (Ceanothus fendleri). The understory herba-
ceous plant community is characterized by a mix of mostly native
perennial graminoids and forbs. Common perennial grasses include
squirreltail (Elymus elymoides), Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica),
mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia montana), muttongrass (Poa fendle-
riana), Junegrass (Koeleria macrantha), and there is also a dominant
component of sedge species (Carex spp.). Common forbs include
ragworts (Packera spp.), ﬂeabanes (Erigeron spp.), Wheeler’s thistle
(Cirsium wheeleri), pineywoods geranium (Geranium caespitosum),
alpine false parsley (Pseudocymopterus montanus), groundcover
milkvetch (Astragalus humistratus), yellow hawkweed (Hieracium
fendleri), and yarrow (Achillea millefolium). Soils are classiﬁed as a
complex of Mollic Eutroboralfs, Lithic Argiborolls, and Eutric Gloss-
oboralfs, of ﬁne to cobbly clay loam texture, derived from volcanic
parent material (USDA Forest Service, 1987). Between 1984 and
2013, annual precipitation at Greer, Arizona (elevation 2500 m,
approximately 25 km southeast of the study site) averaged
494 mm with an average minimum temperature of 9.1 C in
January and an average maximum temperature of 24.3 C in July
(Greer NCDC COOP Station ID 023683 and Greer Remote Automated
Weather Station (RAWS) ID 020404, Western Regional Climate
Center, www.wrcc.dri.edu, accessed 03.03.14). Most precipitation
occurs in winter and during summer monsoon storms. Land use
history at the site includes grazing beginning in the late 1800s
and ﬁre suppression since the early twentieth century.
2.2. Field methods
To test effects of elevation on forest structural changes
since Euro-American settlement and ﬁre exclusion, and compare
ecological responses to alternative restoration treatments, we
established a completely randomized block design (4 blocks  3
treatments) at the ﬁeld site in 2002. Blocks were approximately
40 ha each and were arrayed along an elevation gradient (240-m)
as described above (Fig. 1). Each block was divided into treatment
units of 13 ha. One of three treatments was randomly assigned to
J.P. Roccaforte et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 337 (2015) 174–185
175

each unit: (1) untreated control, (2) full treatment (mechanical tree
thinning followed by prescribed burning), and (3) burn-only
(prescribed burning without thinning). We installed 20 sampling
plots on a 60-m grid within each treatment unit (240 total plots
across study site). Plot grids were oriented with cardinal directions
(Fig. 1) and were randomly overlaid on maps within each
treatment unit using a geographical information system (GIS).
The ﬁrst plot in each unit was located using a global positioning
system (GPS) device; subsequent plots were installed using
measuring tapes and compasses.
We collected pre-treatment data for all plots between 31 May
and 12 August 2002, one-year post-treatment data between 22
May and 21 June 2009, and ﬁve-year post-treatment data between
18 May and 5 June 2013. We measured all trees taller than breast
height (137 cm) on each 400-m2 circular (11.28 m radius), ﬁxed-
area sampling plot. We recorded species, condition (living or
snag/log classes from Thomas et al., 1979), diameter at breast
height (dbh), total height, crown base height, and a preliminary
ﬁeld classiﬁcation of pre- or post-settlement origin for each tree
located within the plot. Potentially presettlement ponderosa pine

trees were identiﬁed based on size (>40 cm diameter at stump
height (dsh), 40 cm above ground level) or yellow bark (White,
1985; Mast et al., 1999). Trees of other species were identiﬁed as
potentially presettlement if dbh P 37.5 cm (Douglas-ﬁr, white ﬁr,
southwestern
white
pine),
dbh P 20 cm
(aspen),
or P 17 cm
(juniper, oak, pinyon) (Fulé et al., 2002a). We collected increment
cores for all potentially presettlement trees and a 10% subsample
of all postsettlement trees to determine age and past size. We
measured tree regeneration (trees < 1.37 cm dbh) on a 100-m2
subplot (5.64 m radius) nested within each overstory sampling
plot and recorded species, condition, and height class (<40 cm;
40.1–80 cm;
80.1–137 cm)
for
each
seedling
or
sprout.
We
recorded presence/absence of tree canopy cover (vertical projec-
tion of canopy taller than 137 cm) every 30 cm along a 50-m line
transect oriented with the slope through the plot center (canopy
cover was not measured in 2009). We measured dead woody
surface fuels biomass and forest ﬂoor depth on a 15.2-m planar tran-
sect (Brown, 1974). Transects were installed in a random direction
(azimuth between 0 and 359 selected from a random number
generator) from each plot center and fuels were tallied by
moisture-lag class (1-h, 1.8 m; 10-h, 1.8 m; 100-h, 3.7 m; 1000-h
sound, 15.2 m; 1000-h rotten, 15.2 m). Ten forest ﬂoor depth mea-
surements were recorded every 1.5 m along each transect.
2.3. Treatment implementation
Thinning in the full treatment was implemented between July
2006 and February 2007 at a cost of $1360 ha1. The thinning pre-
scription was developed according to the site-speciﬁc historical
(pre-ﬁre exclusion) pattern of tree species composition and spatial
arrangement as evidenced by large, old trees and remnant dead
tree structures (e.g., standing dead snags, dead and down logs,
cut stumps) found at the site (Covington et al., 1997). All living
ponderosa pines that were assumed (based on crown form and
bark characteristics) to pre-date widespread ﬁre exclusion associ-
ated with Euro-American settlement (White, 1985) or >40 cm
dbh were marked for retention. In addition, wherever evidence of
presettlement trees was encountered, an average of 1.5 postsettle-
ment (i.e., trees established after ﬁre exclusion) ‘‘replacement’’
trees was retained within an 18-m radius of the dead structure.
Oak and aspen were not marked for thinning. Tree boles were
harvested and thinning slash was lopped and scattered on the site.
Forest ﬂoor material was raked away from large snags to limit
ignition during prescribed ﬁres in the full and burn-only treatment
units. Forest Service crews implemented prescribed burns using
strip head ﬁres in all treatment units on the afternoons of 30 and
31 October and 1 November 2008 at a cost of $125 ha1. The
downwind edge of each unit was blacklined; subsequent strips
were ignited 3–5 m apart. Windspeeds ranged from 0 to 5 km h1,
wind direction was primarily from the north and east, and relative
humidity varied from 21% to 29%. Fires burned primarily on the
surface, but some passive crown ﬁre (torching) was observed in
the burn-only units.
2.4. Laboratory and statistical analyses
We mounted and surfaced tree increment cores and visually
cross-dated (Stokes and Smiley, 1968) them with local tree-ring
chronologies. We counted rings on cores that could not be cross-
dated, usually junipers or young trees. We estimated additional
years to the center ring using a pith locator (concentric circles
which were matched to the curvature and density of the inner
rings) for cores that missed the pith (Applequist, 1958).
We reconstructed historical forest structure (basal area [BA],
tree
density,
and
diameter
distribution
by
species)
using
dendroecological methods (Fulé et al., 1997; Mast et al., 1999;
Bakker et al., 2008). Diameter was reconstructed for all living trees
by
subtracting
the
radial
growth
since
1880
measured
on
increment cores and death date of dead trees was estimated on
the basis of tree condition class using diameter-dependent snag
decomposition rates (Thomas et al., 1979; Rogers et al., 1984).
The year 1880 was chosen because it represented the period of dis-
ruption of the historical frequent ﬁre regime and Euro-American
settlement of the Southwest (Swetnam and Baisan, 1996; Moore
et al., 1999). Moore et al. (2004), reported that reconstruction ﬁeld
techniques in a southwestern ponderosa pine forest were reliable
within ±10% of tree density over 90 years.
We estimated canopy fuel load (CFL, kg m2) using locally
developed dbh-based allometric equations for foliage and ﬁne
twigs of ponderosa pine (Fulé et al., 2001), Gambel oak (Clary and
Teidemann, 1986), and pinyon and juniper (Grier et al., 1992); we
used equations compiled by Ter-Mikaelian and Korzuhkin (1997)
for aspen, Douglas-ﬁr, southwestern white pine, and white ﬁr.
Canopy depth (CD) was estimated using averages of maximum tree
height (top of crown) and crown base height (bottom of crown). We
used linear regression (r2 = 0.34; y = 0.1533x + 1.2912; n = 8909) to
predict mean canopy base height (CBH) for each forested plot in
1880 using the dbh – crown base height relationship of all live trees
sampled in 2002. Non-forested plots (those with no live trees) were
omitted from statistical analysis of CBH in all years. Canopy bulk
density (CBD, kg m3) was calculated as CFL divided by CD.
To quantify site-speciﬁc reference conditions and test for effects
of elevation on presettlement and pre-treatment forest structure
and canopy fuels, we used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
(Kuehl, 1994). As treatments had not been implemented for these
time periods (and treatment was not a factor in these models), we
used treatment units within blocks as replicates (n = 3) and the
four blocks represented different levels of the factor ‘‘elevation’’.
To test for effects of treatment on all variables (except canopy
cover) we used ANOVA for repeated measures (Kuehl, 1994) and
a mixed effects model with sampling year, block, and treatment
as factors. Experimental block was considered a random effect. If
a signiﬁcant treatment effect was found and there was no signiﬁ-
cant interaction among treatment and sampling year the ANOVA
was followed by Tukey’s honestly signiﬁcant difference (HSD)
post-hoc multiple comparisons test. If a signiﬁcant treatment x
sampling year interaction was found, we analyzed treatment
effects separately within years as suggested by Looney and
Stanley
(1989).
Within-year
ANOVA
was
followed
by
HSD
post-hoc tests when treatment effects were signiﬁcant. We
analyzed differences among treatments for canopy cover in 2002
and 2013 using one-way ANOVA. All data met the assumptions
of normality and homogeneity of variance based on the Shapiro-
Wilk test and Levine test. Treatment differences were assessed at
a = 0.05.
We
evaluated
restoration
effectiveness
for
forest
structure, surface fuels, and canopy fuels variables by comparing
post-treatment values to the site-speciﬁc historical reference
conditions, deﬁned as the minimum and maximum values across
elevation in 1880.
3. Results
3.1. Effects of elevation on historical and contemporary forest
conditions
The reconstructed (1880) estimate of BA averaged 9.2 m2 ha1
(range: 6.1–12.3 m2 ha1) and tree density averaged 86.2 trees ha1
(range: 48.3–123.3 trees ha1) (Fig. 2, Table S1). There were no
differences among the four elevations in mean BA (F = 3.7,
p = 0.06), but signiﬁcant differences were detected for tree density
(F = 8.7, p = 0.007) in 1880, with the highest tree density values
J.P. Roccaforte et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 337 (2015) 174–185
177

occurring at the two upper elevation sites (Fig. 2a). Although
ponderosa pine was the dominant tree species in 1880 (95% of
total
BA
and
density),
overstory
composition
appeared
to
differ across elevation with more xeric species (e.g., juniper, and
Gambel
oak)
present
at
the
lowest
site,
and
more
mesic
species (e.g., Douglas-ﬁr, aspen, and white ﬁr) at the highest site.
Neither pinyon pine nor southwestern white pine were detected
in 1880.
In 2002, BA averaged 28.9 m2 ha1 (range: 24.2–35.4 m2 ha1)
and
tree
density
averaged
927.9 trees ha1
(range:
572.5–
1449.2 trees ha1), representing three- and ten-fold increases,
respectively, compared to 1880 values (Fig. 2, Table S1). Signiﬁcant
differences were detected for BA (F = 5.1, p = 0.03) and tree density
(F = 8.3, p = 0.008) between elevations in 2002 but there was no
clear pattern related to elevation. In 2002, ponderosa pine was
the dominant tree species (95% of BA and tree density) across the
elevation gradient in 2002. Density of white ﬁr and southwestern
white pine appeared to increase at the two upper elevation sites
as compared to 1880 conditions.
Reconstructed (1880) diameter distributions for each elevation
indicated that the majority of trees had diameters in the 25–45 cm
dbh classes, with relatively fewer trees in the lowest and highest
dbh classes (Fig. 3, white bars). Across all elevations, about
two-thirds of the trees in 1880 had a dbh between 20 and 50 cm
and only 23% of the trees had a dbh < 20 cm. By 2002, all dbh
classes < 40 cm increased relative to 1880 values at each elevation
(Fig. 3, black bars). Across all elevations, two-thirds of the trees had
a dbh < 20 cm. Trees > 60 cm dbh decreased from 5.7 trees ha1 to
4.4 trees ha 1 between 1880 and 2002.
In 1880, prior to ﬁre exclusion, mean CFL (0.26 kg m2) and
mean CBD (0.013 kg m3) values were the lowest observed in
any time period in this study (Table S2). By 2002, prior to treat-
ment, CFL and CBD increased to 0.86 kg m2 and 0.051 kg m3,
respectively, across the study site. The only canopy fuel variable
that showed signiﬁcant differences across elevation was CBD in
1880 (F = 8.1, p = 0.008) which was highest at the two upper
elevation sites.
3.2. Treatment effects on forest structure and fuels
In 2009 and 2013, the full treatment signiﬁcantly affected forest
structure
and
shifted
attributes
near
historical
reference
conditions, but the burn-only treatment showed little change from
the control (Fig. 4). The full treatment reduced BA by 53% from
31.1 m2 ha1 to 14.7 m2 ha1 and tree density by 84% from
998 trees ha1 to 164 trees ha1 between 2002 and 2009; BA
increased to 15 m2 ha1 and density decreased from 164 trees ha1
to 153 trees ha1 between 2009 and 2013. In the burn-only treat-
ment, BA increased by 3% from 27.5 m2 ha1 to 28.3 m2 ha1 and
tree
density
was
reduced
by
18%
from
837 trees ha1
to
689 trees ha1
between
2002
and
2009;
BA
increased
to
29.1 m2 ha1 and density decreased to 625 trees ha1 between
2009 and 2013. Mean BA in 2009 (F = 8.0, p = 0.01) and 2013
(F = 6.7, p = 0.02) was signiﬁcantly lower in the full treatment com-
pared to the control and burn-only (Fig. 4a). Mean tree density in
2009 (F = 7.3, p = 0.02) was signiﬁcantly lower in the full treatment
compared to the control and burn-only (Fig. 4b). Mean tree density
in 2013 (F = 6.7, p = 0.0003) was signiﬁcantly lower in the full
treatment compared to the control and burn-only and the burn-
only was signiﬁcantly lower than the control (Fig. 4b). In the con-
trol, BA increased slightly from 27.8 m2 ha1 to 29.4 m2 ha1 and
tree density decreased from 948 trees ha1 to 916 trees ha1
between 2002 and 2009; BA increased to 30.5 m2 ha1 and density
decreased to 915 trees ha1 by 2013 (Fig. 4). Post-treatment BA
and density values were slightly above the historical reference
conditions (6–12 m2 ha1, reconstructed for 1880 across elevation)
in the full treatment, but well above the historical reference
conditions in the burn-only and control (Fig. 4). Ponderosa pine
was the dominant tree species at the study site following treat-
ment, making up P 90% of BA and tree density in each treatment
in 2009 and 2013. Post-treatment overstory composition did not
change relative to 2002.
Prior to treatment in 2002, canopy cover averaged 50% (range
48–53%) across all treatments and was not signiﬁcantly different
between treatments (F = 2.6, p = 0.1). The full treatment reduced
canopy cover by 47% from 53% to 28%. Canopy cover was signiﬁ-
cantly lower in the full treatment compared to the control and
burn-only in 2013 (F = 9.7, p = 0.008). By 2013, canopy cover
increased by 10% from 49% to 55% in the control and by 2% from
48% to 49% in the burn-only.
Diameter distributions at all sites were dominated by small-
diameter trees in 2002 (Fig. 5a–c), and varied depending on treat-
ment in 2009 (Fig. 5d–f) and 2013 (Fig. 5g–i). Although total tree
density in 2009 for the full treatment was nearly double the histor-
ical mean, <15% of the trees had a dbh < 20 cm dbh (compared to
65% in 2002), indicating that the majority of the reduction occurred
in the lowest dbh classes (Fig. 5e). In 2009, the diameter distribu-
tion was slightly altered by the burn-only treatment; however,
more than half of the trees remaining after treatment had
dbh < 20 cm (Fig. 5f). The 2013 diameter distribution in the burn-
only showed further reductions in the lower diameter classes with
45% of the trees having dbh < 20 cm (Fig. 5i). In 2009, the diameter
distribution in the control showed little change, although total tree
density decreased by 3% from the 2002 measurement (Fig. 5d). The
diameter distributions for the control (Fig. 5g) and full treatment

forests and spanned an elevation gradient (approximately 2340–2580 m) from the
pinyon-juniper ecotone to the dry mixed conifer ecotone. Different letters across

(Fig. 5h) showed little change between 2009 and 2013. The post-
treatment diameter distribution in the full treatment (Fig. 5e and
h) was similar to the historical distributions (Fig. 3, white bars);
the distributions in the burn-only and control remained similar
to pre-treatment distributions (Fig. 5a–c).
Live presettlement trees comprised 16% of BA, but < 2% of tree
density across the site in 2002. On average, 0.9 presettlement
trees ha1, or 6% of those alive prior to treatment, were cut, and
1.6 presettlement trees ha1, or 9% of the presettlement trees alive
prior to treatment, died in the full treatment between 2002 and
2009. By 2013, an additional 0.2 presettlement trees ha1, or 4%
of those alive prior to treatment, were cut (aspen trees cut for fuel-
wood), and an additional 0.9 presettlement trees ha1, or 6% of
those alive prior to treatment, died in the full treatment. On aver-
age, 1.9 presettlement trees ha1, or 23% of those alive prior to
treatment, died in the burn-only by 2009. By 2013, an additional
0.6 presettlement trees ha1, or 8% of those alive prior to treatment
died in the burn-only. On average, 1.9 presettlement trees ha1, or
10% of those alive in 2002, died by 2009, and an additional 0.9
presettlement trees ha1, or 5%, died by 2013 in the control.
Post-treatment ingrowth (new trees that reached breast height)
averaged 63 trees ha1 in the control, 10 trees ha1 in the full
treatment, and 16 trees ha1 in the burn-only.
Regeneration was highly variable: total regeneration (all species
and all height classes) ranged between 210 and 6071 trees ha1
across all treatments and years (Table S3). Ponderosa pine
dominated regeneration in all treatments and years except for
the full treatment in 2009 (dominated by aspen), and the
burn-only in 2009 (dominated by New Mexico locust). Between
2002
and
2009,
total
regeneration
decreased
by
69%
from
1551 trees ha1 to 475 trees ha1 in the full treatment and by
89% from 1865 trees ha1 to 210 trees ha1 in the burn-only. In
2013, total regeneration averaged 6071 trees ha1 in the full
treatment and 1974 trees ha1 in the burn-only. No signiﬁcant
differences were found for total regeneration.
Total surface fuel loads were high prior to treatments (Table S2).
Forest ﬂoor depths averaged 3.1 cm (range = 3.0–3.2 cm) and
woody debris averaged 23.3 Mg ha1 (range = 13.0–33.1 Mg ha1)
across the entire site in 2002. No signiﬁcant differences were found
prior to treatment for any surface fuel variables. Between 2002 and
2013, forest ﬂoor depth decreased by 83% from 3.2 cm to 0.5 cm and
woody debris decreased by 57% from 33.1 Mg ha1 to 14.2 Mg ha1
in the full treatment. Forest ﬂoor depth decreased by 75% from
3.0 cm
to
0.8 cm
and
woody
debris
decreased
by
69%
from 23.7 Mg ha1 to 7.3 Mg ha1 in the burn-only over the same
time period. In the control, forest ﬂoor depth decreased by 65%
from 3.1 cm to 1.1 cm and woody debris increased by 41%
from 8.4 Mg ha1 to 11.9 Mg ha1 between 2002 and 2013. Duff
was the only surface fuel variable that had an overall treatment
effect from repeated measures analysis, but did not have a
signiﬁcant treatment ⁄ year interaction. The post-hoc test showed
signiﬁcantly lower mean duff depth in the full treatment compared
to the control but was not different than the burn-only (F = 4.4,
p = 0.047).

Post-treatment canopy fuels values varied depending on treat-
ment (Fig. 6). The full treatment reduced CFL by 57% from
0.91 kg m2 to 0.39 kg m2 and CBD by 53% from 0.053 kg m3 to
0.025 kg m3 between 2002 and 2009; CFL and CBD remained
stable or increased slightly in the burn-only and control over the
same time period (Fig. 6a and b). Little change in CFL and CBD
occurred between 2009 and 2013 in all treatments. Mean CFL in
2009 (F = 8.8, p = 0.001) and 2013 (F = 9.5, p = 0.008), and mean
CBD in 2009 (F = 11.8, p = 0.005) and 2013 (F = 16.1, p = 0.002)
were signiﬁcantly lower in the full treatment compared to the
control and burn-only. In 2002, mean CBH was 3.7 m across all
treatments (Fig. 6c). The full treatment increased CBH from 4.1 m
to 6.8 m and the burn-only increased CBH from 3.8 m to 6.0 m
between 2002 and 2009; CBH in the control increased slightly from
3.2 m to 3.8 m over the same time period. CBH decreased
slightly in the full and burn-only treatments and increased
slightly in the control between 2009 and 2013. Mean CBH in
2009 (F = 6.4, p = 0.02) was lower in the control compared to the
full and burn-only treatments. All post-treatment canopy fuels
variables in the full treatment approached or were within the
historical reference conditions; in the burn-only treatment, CBH
was the only variable that approached the historical reference
conditions (Fig. 6).
4. Discussion
4.1. Effects of elevation on historical and contemporary forest
conditions
Prior to Euro-American settlement, the forests at our study site
were relatively open and composed primarily of ponderosa pine.
Reconstructed BA and tree density in 1880 (6.1–12.3 m2 ha1 and
48.3–123.3 trees ha1, respectively) were similar to the historical
range of variability found for ponderosa pine forests of the South-
west (Stoddard, 2011; Reynolds et al., 2013). The dendroecological
methods used in our study to reconstruct historical stand condi-
tions are relatively robust due to the absence of ﬁre since 1880
combined with the semiarid environment limiting the decomposi-
tion of conifer wood (Fulé et al., 1997; Mast et al., 1999; Huffman
et al., 2001). The differences in tree density and canopy fuel load-
ings across elevation in 1880 were likely due to more productive
conditions associated with higher elevation sites (Moore et al.,
2004). Mesic species were present at the upper elevation sites in
1880; however, these shade-tolerant, ﬁre-resistant species were
not abundant in 1880 and their density was likely regulated by fre-
quent surface ﬁres. Similar ﬁndings have been reported for mesic
ponderosa pine and low-elevation dry mixed conifer forest sites
in the Southwest (Moore et al., 2004; Fulé et al., 2009). The 1880
diameter distributions at our site, which had relatively low num-
bers of small-diameter trees, were consistent with previous studies
that reported historical diameter distributions in southwestern
ponderosa pine forests (Moore et al., 2004). Although BA and tree
density values varied across elevation in 1880, the range of values
(i.e., historical reference conditions) was relatively narrow com-
pared to the range of values observed in 2002. The relatively low
variability observed in 1880 was likely related to the frequent
occurrence of low-severity ﬁres which regulated tree recruitment.
Between 1880 and 2002, BA, tree density, and canopy fuel
loadings increased substantially across the study site. Diameter
distributions
also
changed
from
distributions
dominated
by
mid- to large-diameter trees in 1880, to distributions dominated
by small-diameter trees in 2002. Similar changes following ﬁre
exclusion were also observed at other forests in the western USA
(Harrod et al., 1999; Fulé et al., 2001; Waltz et al., 2003;
Youngblood et al., 2004). The trend of higher BA and density values
found at the higher elevation held true in both 1880 and 2002, but
the contemporary range of values for BA and density was multiple
times greater than the historical reference conditions. The diame-
ter distributions at the upper elevation sites appeared to have a
more pronounced ‘‘reverse-J’’ shape compared to the distributions
at the lower elevation sites. While ponderosa pine was the tree
species exhibiting the greatest increases at our site, several mesic
species appeared to increase, including Douglas-ﬁr, white ﬁr, and
southwestern white pine—all of which either had limited presence
or were absent historically. Increases in mesic conifer density and
the resulting shift in forest species composition have been docu-
mented at other frequent-ﬁre-adapted sites in
Arizona and
throughout the western USA (Gruell et al., 1982; Fiedler, 2000;
Miller and Urban, 2000; Hessburg and Agee, 2003; Moore et al.,
2004; Cocke et al., 2005). For example, Fulé et al. (1997), reported
that Douglas-ﬁr and white ﬁr made up 5% of the contemporary for-
est at Volunteer Mountain even though Douglas-ﬁr was absent and
only a trace of white ﬁr was found to occur prior to ﬁre exclusion in
1883. The lack of ﬁre between 1880 and 2002 facilitated the wider
contemporary range of values for BA and density across elevation
and the higher density values and increased presence of mesic
species observed at the upper elevation sites. Consequently, our
reconstructions suggest that the upper elevation sites may be more
degraded than the lower elevation sites.
4.2. Treatment effects on forest structure and fuels
After
treatment,
in
2009
and
2013,
the
full
treatment
signiﬁcantly reduced BA and tree density compared to the control.
Although the post-treatment BA and density in the full treatment
were about 1.5 times the historical mean values, BA was reduced
by more than 50% and density was reduced by more than 80%
compared to pre-treatment levels, moving these areas close to
Fig. 4. Basal area (A) and tree density (B) by treatment in 2002 (pre-treatment),
2009 (1-year post-treatment), and 2013 (5-year post-treatment) relative to the
historical reference conditions at the site in 1880 (gray shaded area). Different
letters within years denote statistically signiﬁcant means at a = 0.05.

the historical reference conditions in 1880 (Fig. 4). The higher post-
treatment values observed in the full treatment (compared to 1880
values) were intentional. The thinning prescription was designed
to leave excess replacement trees, indicating that the treatments
were implemented effectively.
A photo time series visually
illustrated the reduction of tree density and BA following the full
treatment (Fig. 7). Similar reductions in BA and tree density
following thinning plus burning treatments were also reported in
similar studies in northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests (Fulé
et al., 2001; 2002b; Waltz et al., 2003). Fire performance analysis
conducted at six National Fire and Fire Surrogate study sites in
the western USA strongly indicated that mechanical thinning plus
burning was more effective when compared to burn-only and
thin-only treatments (Stephens et al., 2009). Our results are also
consistent with ﬁndings reported in a systematic review of
literature
concerning
the
effects
of
thinning
and
burning
treatments on restoring ﬁre behavior attributes in western USA
pine forests (Fulé et al., 2012). In this review, meta-analysis
showed that thinning plus burning was more effective at reducing
BA (mean effect size = 0.6; 49 studies) and tree density (mean
effect size = 0.3; 62 studies) compared to thin-only and burn-only
treatments (Fulé et al., 2012).
In contrast, the burn-only treatment produced only slight
reductions in BA and tree density by 2009 (Fig. 4). Although the
reductions primarily occurred in the lowest diameter classes
(Fig. 5f), forest structure in the burn-only was moved only slightly
toward the historical reference condition (Fig. 4). Fulé et al. (2006)
reported similar reductions in BA and tree density one year after
burn-only treatments at the Grand Canyon. Similar results were
reported at six of seven National Fire and Fire Surrogate study sites
(McIver et al., 2012), and the short-term results at our site are also
consistent with Fulé et al.’s (2012) systematic review ﬁndings that
showed burn-only treatments were the least effective at reducing
BA (30 studies) and tree density (50 studies). The additional tree
density reductions that occurred between 2009 and 2013 (Figs. 4
and 5i) were likely due to conservative tree condition assessment
in 2009 and delayed mortality that was evident by 2013.
Canopy cover, when combined with other variables, is a useful
indicator for determining effects of management alternatives
(Huffman et al., 2012). The pre-treatment mean canopy cover value
Fig. 5. Diameter at breast height (DBH) distributions by treatment in 2002 (pre-treatment) (A–C), 2009 (1-year post-treatment) (D–F), and 2013 (5-year post-treatment) (G–
I).

in this study was similar to values reported at other untreated
ponderosa pine sites (Fulé et al., 2002b; 2006; Waltz et al., 2003;
Roccaforte et al., 2010). Mean canopy cover values following the
full treatment (28%) were consistent with presettlement values
found near Flagstaff, AZ of 17% estimated by Covington and
Sackett (1986) and 22% estimated by White (1985) and to post-
treatment values found at other southwestern ponderosa pine sites
(Fulé et al., 2002b; 2006; Waltz et al., 2003; Roccaforte et al., 2010).
Canopy cover is inversely related to total herbage production
(Ffolliott, 1983), and the reductions in the full treatment resulted
in signiﬁcant increases in total cover and richness of herbaceous
understory vegetation at our study site (Strahan et al., in prep).
In contrast, the burn-only treatment did not effectively reduce can-
opy cover.
Treatment effectiveness can also be assessed by evaluating
post-treatment diameter distributions relative to those of the
historical forests. The diameter distribution in areas that received
the full treatment (Fig. 5e and h) closely resembled the historical
distribution, which likely has implications for wildlife and poten-
tial ﬁre behavior. Other studies in northern Arizona ponderosa pine
forests (Waltz et al., 2003; Roccaforte et al., 2010) and in northeast
Oregon (Youngblood et al., 2006) have documented similar effects
on stand structure following thinning plus burning treatments. In
contrast,
the
distribution
in
the
control
remained
virtually
unchanged by 2013 (Fig. 5g) and slightly shifted towards the
historical distribution in areas that were burned but not thinned
in 2009 (Fig. 5f). Results reported at other sites showed that burn-
only treatments had little effect on diameter distributions one year
(Fulé et al., 2006) and four years (Youngblood et al., 2006) after
burns. By 2013, the diameter distribution in the burn-only showed
further, albeit modest, reductions in the lowest two diameter
classes, indicating that the full extent of mortality may not be
evident immediately following burn-only treatments (Fig. 5i).
Presettlement trees are relatively rare and ecologically impor-
tant (Kalies, 2014) and were not intended to be cut in this study.
In addition, the goal of the treatments was to limit mortality of
these ‘‘legacy’’ trees because they provide genetic and structural
diversity to the ecosystem, and take centuries to replace (Moore
et al., 1999; DellaSalla et al., 2004). In the full treatment, 15% of
presettlement trees were cut or died between 2002 and 2009, an
intermediate value compared to presettlement mortality in the
control (10%) and the burn-only (23%). Roccaforte et al. (2010)
reported similar percentages of presettlement trees that died or
were cut as a result of thinning plus burning treatments on a land-
scape-scale restoration project at Mt. Trumbull six to seven years
following treatment. By ﬁve years post-treatment at our site, pre-
settlement tree mortality increased to 15% in the control, 25% in
the full treatment, and 31% in the burn-only. Delayed mortality
that disproportionally affected large trees following thinning plus
burning treatments was also observed at Mt. Trumbull (Fulé
et al., 2007) and in Oregon (Youngblood et al., 2009). Our ﬁndings
indicate a tradeoff with regards to old tree mortality: treatments
are likely to increase old-tree mortality compared to levels
observed without active treatment; however, they may help
surviving old trees by reducing their risk of death by severe ﬁre
(Savage and Mast, 2005), reducing competitive stress for water
and nutrients (Feeney et al. 1998; Stone et al., 1999), and
increasing resilience to insect attacks (Wallin et al., 2004).
CFL and CBD dynamics were similar to those found in similar stud-
ies: low values prior to ﬁre exclusion, a marked increase by the pre-
treatment measurement, substantial reductions following thinning
plus burning, and minor reductions following burn-only treatments
(Fig. 6a and b). The range of CFL (0.25–0.92 kg m2) and CBD
(0.013–0.058 kg m3) values in this study were consistent with those
reported in a similar study by Fulé et al. (2002b) at Grand Canyon
(CFL: 0.29–0.1 kg m2; CBD: 0.02–0.07 kg m3). The reductions in
CFL (57%) and CBD (53%) following the full treatment in our study
were also similar to canopy fuels reductions reported by Fulé et al.
(2002b) at Grand Canyon (CFL = 66%; CBD = 61%) and by Fulé et al.
(2001) at Fort Valley (CFL = 58%; CBD = 48%). Fulé et al. (2002b)
reported slight reductions in CFL (27%) and CBD (19%) following
burn-only treatments, but the same treatment at our site did not
reduce CFL or CBD values. The full treatment effectively reduced
CFL and CBD close to the historical reference conditions in 1880
compared to the burn-only which was not effective (Fig. 6a and b).
In contrast, the full and burn-only treatments effectively raised CBH
to within or near the historical reference conditions (Fig. 6c).

5. Conclusion
This study reconstructed reference conditions across an eleva-
tion gradient and tested the effectiveness of full and burn-only
treatments to restore forest structure and fuel loads in a ponderosa
pine forest in the White Mountains, Arizona. The study ﬁlls an
important geographical data gap in the southwestern USA. Results
from previous studies indicate that responses to restoration may
include improved ecosystem function (Covington et al., 1997;
Kaye et al., 2005), increased vigor in old trees (Feeney et al.,
1998), improved resistance to disturbance agents, such as bark
beetles (Wallin et al., 2004) and ﬁre (Fulé et al., 2001; Roccaforte
et al., 2008), and increases in native herbaceous understory
vegetation (Stoddard et al., 2011).
Of the treatments tested in this experiment, the full treatment
which used remnant ﬁeld evidence to guide thinning followed by
prescribed burning was the only one that immediately shifted for-
est structure, diameter distributions, and canopy fuel loadings to
levels near or within the historical reference conditions. Although
the full treatment had higher presettlement tree mortality than
the control, presettlement trees had a higher probability of
surviving thinning plus burning treatments when compared to
burning alone. The study also indicated that higher elevation pon-
derosa pine sites may be more degraded than lower elevation sites
due to increases of mesic species which may have implications for
treatment prioritization.
The results from this experiment will provide information
about ecological responses to such treatments and are likely to
affect management decisions on the Apache-Sitgreaves National
Forests and in other frequent-ﬁre ecosystems throughout the wes-
tern USA. For example, it is commonly argued that burning without
thinning may be an appropriate management alternative in some
cases because burn-only treatments usually cost less and are less
likely to be litigated than treatments that involve tree cutting.
However, results from this study indicate that burn-only treat-
ments will not shift forest structure and fuel loadings to levels near
the historical reference conditions in the short-term. Moreover,
while burn-only treatments may be appropriate in areas with
Fig. 7. Repeat photos taken at the site show that the small-diameter trees present in the full treatment in 2002 (A) were absent in 2009 (B) and 2013 (C) following thinning
plus burning; photos from an area that had a burn-only treatment implemented show dense stand conditions in 2002 (D), scorched tree canopies in 2009 (E), and a raised
canopy base height by 2013 (F).

limited access to mechanized thinning, if tree density and canopy
fuels are not effectively reduced following the initial burn, subse-
quent repeated prescribed burns may have limited effectiveness
for restoring ponderosa pine forests. Finally, the study results
indicate that burn-only treatments have the potential to increase
presettlement tree mortality at rates higher than other restoration
treatments. Consequently, managers will have to consider trade-
offs between full and burn-only treatments and increasingly make
those decisions in the context of climate-induced, landscape-scale
forest ﬁres (Fried et al., 2004; Saeger and Vecchi, 2010).
