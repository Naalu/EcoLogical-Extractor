ABSTRACT
In ecology textbooks prior to the 1970s, Aldo
Leopold’s classic story of predator control, over-
population of deer, and habitat degradation on the
Kaibab Plateau during the 1920s epitomized pred-
ator regulation of herbivore populations. However,
the story disappeared from texts in the late 20th
century after several papers noted uncertainties in
estimations of the deer population and provided
alternative explanations. We re-examined the case
study by determining the age structure of aspen
(Populus tremuloides Michx.) on the plateau. Aspen
comprises the majority of deer browse in the
summer, and the absence of a normal cohort of
aspen from the 1920s would indicate deer over-
population. The number of aspen (at 1.4 m) dating
to the 1920s was an order of magnitude lower than
the null expectation. Other periods of unusual
numbers of aspen included high numbers of aspen
dating to the 1880s and 1890s (when regular sur-
face fires ceased), few aspen dating from 1953 to
1962 (after a second irruption of the deer popula-
tion), and very high numbers from 1968 to 1992
(coincident with widespread logging). These con-
vergent lines of evidence support the idea of ex-
treme deer herbivory in the 1920s, consistent with
food limitation of deer at high populations (bot-
tom–up control) and predation limitation at low
deer
populations
(top–down
control).
Some
uncertainty remains within the overall story, and
this level of ambiguity is common in case studies
that involve population ecology, land manage-
ment, and people at the scale of 1,000 km2 and 100
years. A complete version of the Kaibab deer story
and its history would be a valuable, realistic case
study for ecology texts.

INTRODUCTION
The story of the Kaibab deer herd formed a cor-
nerstone of population ecology from the 1920s
(compare Elton 1927) through the early 1970s
(compare Dasman 1964; Kormandy 1969; Owen
1971; Ricklefs 1973). The classic form of the story
was often attributed to Aldo Leopold (1943), who
reported that reducing the population of predators
on the Kaibab Plateau led to an irruption of the
deer population, degradation of habitat, and lower
carrying capacity for deer. The deer herd on the
Kaibab Plateau was the focus of major controver-
sies between the National Park Service and the
USDA Forest Service, a landmark dispute between
Arizona and the federal government over wildlife
and hunting rights, and even a colorful attempt to
drive deer across the Grand Canyon that was ﬁc-
tionalized in a novel by Zane Grey (Grey 1924;
Young 2002). Rachel Carson (1962) used the
Kaibab deer story in Silent Spring to convince
readers of the importance of predators, and the
story appeared in most ecology textbooks to show

that top predators are critical for controlling eco-
system food webs.
Conﬁdence in the story began to erode when
Caughley
(1970)
highlighted
the
paucity
and
inconsistency of the original data. He suggested
that if a deer irruption actually occurred, the driver
might have been release of the deer from food
competition with livestock after massive livestock
reductions at the end of the 19th century. The role
of predation in regulating food webs was also
challenged by ecologists and land managers in the
1960s and 1970s. Increasing conﬁdence in the
control of food webs by primary production rather
than predation contributed to the adoption of the
‘‘natural regulation’’ policy by the US. National
Park Service. Populations of ungulates were ex-
pected to stabilize at ‘‘natural’’ levels controlled by
food supply (National Research Council 2002).
Some texts began to use Leopold’s Kaibab deer
story not as an example of ecological principles but
as a warning about the dangers of unwarranted
credulity (Dunlap 1988; Botkin 1990). Colinvaux
(1973, 1986) went so far as to claim that the Kaibab
story had been exposed as ﬁction, that the anecdote
was known to be without value, and that the his-
tory was not true. Most recent textbooks simply
omit mention of the once-classic tale (Molles 1999;
Krebs 2001; Ricklefs 2001; Smith and Smith 2001)
or use it as an example of poor ecology (Stiling
2002). Some scientists remain convinced of the role
of mammalian herbivores in shaping the structure
and function of ecosystems (for example, Paine
2000), so the underlying idea of top–down control
of populations retains some support even if the
Kaibab example was inconclusive.
Does the classic Kaibab deer story warrant con-
ﬁdence as a landscape-level demonstration of the
importance of predation in regulating food webs, or
is the value of the story limited to a historical
account of misguided ecology? Mitchell and Free-
man (1993) reviewed a wealth of primary sources
apparently not examined by Caughley (1970) and
concluded that a deer irruption and die-off had
occurred,
but
that
the
drivers
included
both
reductions in predation (including human hunt-
ing) and livestock competition, followed by over-
browsing, severe drought, and a change in the
long-term ﬁre regime. Young (2002) provided the
most thorough synthesis of the story; his primary
conclusion was that whatever the real dynamics of
the deer population might have been, the Kaibab
deer story is an excellent example of the interaction
of science, conservation, politics, and management.
We tested a hypothesis that might shed light on
whether the deer population irrupted in the 1920s as
Aldo Leopold (and almost all of this contemporaries)
believed. Young shoots of aspen (Populus tremuloides
Michx.) comprise the majority of deer browse during
summer on the Kaibab Plateau (Rasmussen 1941;
Bostick 1949; Hungerford 1970) and we hypothe-
sized that aspen regeneration would necessarily be
impaired during periods when high browsing pres-
sure by deer (or livestock) led to massive deer mor-
tality. If the deer population irruption in the 1920s
was real, aspen regeneration on the Kaibab Plateau
should have been far lower than normal during this
period. If the aspen cohort matched the long-term
trend for the plateau, the population of deer was
unlikely to have been high enough to degrade hab-
itat. Support of this hypothesis would indicate that
the classic story may have been true, because the
deer population apparently did irrupt, but this would
not be a direct test of whether the irruption resulted
from predation release.
Our hypothesis was in line with unquantiﬁed
observations of excessive browsing of Populus,
Quercus, and shrubs during the period when the
deer population was reported to be high (Adams
1925; Mann 1941; Russo 1964). Some previous
work lent preliminary support to this hypothesis. In
1935,
McHenry
noted
that
very
few
Populus
tremuloides trees were under 20 years of age in
Grand Canyon National Park, asserting that Le-
pold’s conclusion that deer browsing had effec-
tively
limited
the
aspen
reproduction
‘‘is
an
inescapable fact as one looks through the forest to
see practically no new, young growth.’’ Rasmussen
(1941) noted:
Ordinarily a forest of this type contains a great
number of seedling aspens, but the numbers that
are present on the plateau from 1929 to 1931
could almost be enumerated... [and] few young
trees established during the period of 1916–1932.
Only the exceptional tree has been able to grow
tall enough to get out of reach of the deer during
that period.
Merkle (1962) determined that size distribution
was irregular in the Populus tremuloides of the North
Rim, with abundance in the smallest (under 1 m
tall) and largest size (over 6 m tall) classes and al-
most complete absence in intermediate sizes, which
Merkle assumed was due to the intense browsing
by deer in the 1920s. When Moore and Huffman
(2004) examined the ages of trees invading mead-
ows on the Kaibab Plateau, they noted an absence
of aspen dating to the 1920s.
We also used other sources of information to
develop a more complete picture, determining
whether convergent lines of evidence support the
overall Kaibab deer story. We examined patterns in
228
D. Binkely and others

climate, ﬁre regime, livestock populations, logging,
and hunting by humans. If the overall story were
supported by several lines of evidence, then the
Kaibab Plateau could be useful as a combined
ecological and sociological case study at the scale of
landscapes, centuries, ecosystems, and societies.
METHODS
Background on the Kaibab Plateau
The Kaibab Plateau rises from the desert in north-
ern Arizona, USA, and covers about 1,800 km2
between about 2,200 and 2,750 m; our assessment
of aspen age structure was spread across the 1,300
km2 within the Kaibab National Forest. Ponderosa
pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl ex Laws.) dominates
over about half of this area. The rest of the plateau
is apportioned almost equally among mixed conifer
forests [comprised of spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry
ex Engelm., Picea pungens Engelm.), fir (Abies
concolor (Gord & Glend.) Lindl. ex Hildebr., Abies
lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.), and Douglas-fir (Pseud-
otsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco)], spruce forests,
aspen-dominated forests, and meadows (Joy 2002).
Aspen also occurs as a widespread minor compo-
nent across the plateau, except for the lowest (and
driest) ponderosa pine forests to the north.
Human use of the plateau extends back several
thousand years. At the time of European settlement
in the late 1800s, Ute tribes hunted deer on the
plateau annually, in part for deer hides to trade
with Navajos (Young 2002). John Wesley Powell
and co-workers surveyed the plateau and the sur-
rounding regions in the 1870s, and cattle and sheep
began grazing the plateau in the late 1870s and
early 1880s. Lang and Stewart (1910) performed a
reconnaissance of the plateau to examine its po-
tential for timber and other uses, and they high-
lighted the evidence of repeated surface ﬁres in
developing the open forests of the plateau.
The Grand Canyon Game Preserve was estab-
lished in 1906, and the federal government pro-
hibited
deer
hunting.
Shooting
of
predators
continued and perhaps increased on behalf of
livestock interests; predator reduction programs
were not aimed initially at increasing the deer
population (Young 2002). Forest Service personnel
developed estimates of the deer population almost
annually beginning in 1908. Estimated numbers
rose from an initial 4,000 to a plateau of 30,000
from 1923 through 1930, followed by a decline to
9,000 by 1940 (Mann 1941). Other estimates were
provided by local ranchers; the highest estimate
was 100,000 deer in 1924. The Forest Service later
concluded (Mann 1941) that its earlier estimates of
the deer population from the 1920s ‘‘were far be-
low actual numbers,’’ and revised estimates rose to
a maximum of 100,000. One Forest Service Ranger
(B. Swapp) estimated that the population dropped
by 60% from 1924 to 1926, although his peak
estimate was 50,000 rather than 100,000 deer. This
information was used by Rasmussen (1941) to
produce the curve in the classic story (Figure 1) of
a 20% annual rate of increase in the deer popula-
tion from 1904 to 1924, with a peak of 100,000
deer followed by a 60% decline over several years.
The Forest Service and Arizona Department of
Game and Fish continued to estimate deer popu-
lations through the 20th century.
Investigations of Aspen Age Structures
We examined the age of aspen trees in three
investigations in the fall of 2002 and summer of
2003. The primary investigation was a plateau-
wide descriptive study of the age structure of aspen
within the Kaibab National Forest. The secondary
investigations were small experimental studies of
the age structure in the vicinity of an old ranger
station, where hunting dogs were said to have kept
deer away, and inside and outside a fenced exclo-
sure established by the Forest Service in 1927.
For the primary investigation, we mapped a 1 ·
1 km grid across the Kaibab National Forest por-
tion of the Plateau, and then randomly selected
grid numbers for sampling points. Forest attributes
were characterized at 21 sampling points, with ten
measurement subplots at each point. Five of the
subplots were arrayed at 100 m intervals along an
eastward transect; ﬁve others were arrrayed along
a westward transect offset 100 m to the south. All
data from the ten subplots were averaged to pro-
vide a single representation of the sampling point.
At each subplot, we used calibrated wedge prisms
to determine the basal area of aspen (1.15 m2/ha
basal area factor) and conifers (4.59 m2/ha basal
area factor, for a description of point sampling
with prisms, see Avery and Burkhart 2002). Each
aspen included within the prism’s range was cored
at 1.4 m to determine tree age at that height and
at 0.2 m to determine the number of years taken
to reach 1.4 m. We expected that aspen trees
would need to surpass a height of 1.4 m to escape
the major impact of deer browsing; we also ex-
pected that the time interval between the lower
and upper ages would increase during periods
with heavy browsing.
Tree core dates were determined by standard
dendrochronological techniques at the Ecological
Kaibab Deer Herd
229

Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona Univer-
sity. The age of the cores was determined mainly by
crossdating with marker years (notable years were
1996, 1977, 1976, 1971, 1961, 1956, 1951, 1934,
1904, 1902, 1899, 1896, 1880, 1879, 1864, 1847,
1845, and 1836). About three-fourths of the trees
were cross-datable, and most of those lacking good
marker years were younger than 1970. Ring counts
and counts corrected by marker years were within
3–5 years on cores more than 150 years old, so we
are conﬁdent that all ages are accurate within
about 3–5 years (and most are precise to a single
year).
The data set provided an estimate of the age
structure of aspen currently found on the plateau.
We expected that the average pattern would be an
exponentially
declining
number
of
trees
with
increasing age, reﬂecting a null expectation of
constant rate of recruitment and a constant pro-
portional rate of mortality through time. We esti-
mated this null expectation by ﬁtting a line to the
log10 of tree numbers per km2 for 5-year age classes
of aspen. Periods that deviated by more than one
standard error (SE) from this general trend would
be considered ‘‘not normal,’’ and probably driven
by special factors that did not apply in general over
the time course. We tested whether more time was
required for trees to grow from 0.2 to 1.4 m in
height during periods with few aspen trees by
comparing these periods versus all other periods
with a t-test (with unequal variances).
One
of
the
secondary
investigations
was
prompted by a small article in a 1935 edition of
Grand Canyon Nature Notes: ‘‘In marked contrast
to . . . the Kaibab Forest, one finds rather
extensive reproduction of aspen in the vicinity of
the Quaking Aspen Ranger Station. . . Here a
number of hounds are kept and, of course, no
deer come near’’ (McHenry 1935). The cabin was
built circa 1910 and was used intermittently by
Forest Service rangers until the mid-1920s, when
E. Vaughn obtained a special use permit to live
there. She expanded the water source at the site,
built an additional cabin and corral, and kept
hunting dogs until the early 1940s (J. Vaughn
and
D.
Lund,
personal
communication).
We
relocated the site of this station and placed three
prism plots (which encompassed 38 trees) at
random within the aspen stand that bordered the
meadow. If the age structure of this stand showed
substantial
recruitment
during
periods
of
low
recruitment across the plateau, we would infer
that deer played a major role in aspen recruit-
ment (rather than other plateau-wide factors).
The
other
secondary
investigation
included
relocating a small (8 · 8 m) exclosure established in
1927 (Bostick 1949). The original study included 41
pairs of plots (fenced and nearby unfenced) estab-
lished between 1925 and 1927, with about 15 pairs
within the range of aspen on the plateau. Assess-
ments of the plots in the 1930s and 1940s con-
cluded that ‘‘all (fenced) plots showed recovery’’
(Russo 1964). Using a set of photos taken in 1930,
1942, and 1948, we relocated one of these exclo-
sure sites (plot 28) near Dry Park. The designated
unfenced plot was about 10 m distant from the
fence. We determined the size, number, and age of
all trees in the fenced plot and the unfenced plot.

Figure 1. Estimates of the deer population in the 1920s appeared to differ substantially between the pattern preferred by
Rasmussen (1941) and Leopold (1943) and those of the forest supervisors. The apparent contradiction had disappeared
before Rasmussen and Leopold published their estimates, as Forest Supervisor Walter Mann (1931, 1941) revised the
forest supervisor estimates to more than 100,000 in the mid 1920s. Deer populations showed a second peak in the early
1950s (Russo 1964) and have ranged between 5,000 and 20,000 since then (Barlow and McCulloch 1984; J. Goodwin,

Similar to the secondary study at Quaking Aspen
Springs, we expected that aspen inside the exclo-
sure would have an age structure that included
stems from periods when recruitment was rare
across the landscape.
Finally, we considered the broader context of
potential drivers of aspen recruitment. We exam-
ined the possible role of climate as a driver of the
age structure of aspen by relating age structure to
(a) ring-width chronologies for 15 of the oldest
aspens in our sample, (b) a ponderosa pine ring-
width chronology from the same area, (c) precipi-
tation measures from the South Rim of the Grand
Canyon National Park, and (d) Palmer drought
severity indices (PDSI) derived from Cook and
others (1999) for the North Kaibab area. We used
published and archived records to explore the po-
tential aspen impacts of altered ﬁre regime (Fule´
and other 2002, 2003), livestock populations (Lang
and Stewart 1910; Mann 1931; 1941; Bostick
1949), deer populations (Kimball and Watkins
1951; Russo 1964; Barlow and McCulloch 1984;
and unpublished records from the Arizona Game
and Fish Department, J. Goodwin, personal com-
munication) and logging (Sesnie and Bailey 2003).
RESULTS
Primary Descriptive Investigation
The basal area of aspen averaged 2.9 m2/ha (SE
among 21 sample points = 0.5), comprising 14% of
the total forest basal area of 20.5 m2/ha (SE = 1.2).
Aspen basal area did not correlate with conifer
basal area (P = 0.5). Aspen were widespread across
the plateau; only one of the 21 sample points had
no aspen, and more than half of all subplots had at
least one aspen stem. The size distribution of trees
declined exponentially with increasing tree diam-
eter (Figure 2). If age structure had been deter-
mined based on fixed-area sampling plots, our
representation of ages would have been heavily
weighted by the abundance of young, small-
diameter stems. The prism approach resulted in a
more even distribution of sample trees by size class,
rather than by number of stems/ha (Figure 2).
The maximum age of sampled aspens was more
than 200 years, and tree diameter related moder-
ately well to tree age (Figure 3). Many trees larger
than 20 cm in diameter had decayed heartwood,
preventing age determination. Three-fourths of the
trees less than 15 cm diameter (average age, 50
years) were solid and datable, but up to three-
fourths of the trees greater than 35 cm diameter
(average age, 130 years) had rotten interiors. Our
analyses of the age class distributions of trees is
based only on the datable trees; the actual number
of trees by age class would be higher (especially in
larger size classes) than number of datable trees,
but this would not bias our evaluation of periods
with unusually large (or small) numbers of aspen.
The age structure of aspen on the Kaibab Plateau
generally followed a typical pattern for all-aged
forests, with number of trees decreasing exponen-

tially with age (Figure 4). However, two periods
had substantially more aspen than expected: 1877–
1886 and 1967–1992. The numbers of aspen dating
from these periods were more than an order of
magnitude greater than expected from the long-
term trend. Two other periods showed lower than
expected numbers of aspen. The number of aspen
was more than an order of magnitude lower than
the null expectation from 1913 to 1937, with the
exception of 1923–1927, when numbers of aspen
reached just 25% of the long-term trend. The sec-
ond major period with significantly fewer than
expected aspen was 1953–1962; none of our 234
cores dated to this period.
Across all periods, aspen required an average of
5.0 years to grow from 0.2 to 1.4 m (Figure 5).
The intervals differed strongly among periods,
with significantly longer periods for the 1920s and
1930s than for other periods (no trees were
encountered for the 1950s). During this period
with few aspen trees, trees that reached the
height of 1.4 m (and survived to the present)
were already several decades old at 0.2 m. The
success of these few old trees may have depended
on the accumulation of carbohydrate reserves to
support a rapid height increase beyond the reach
of deer, or an age-related decline in the palat-
ability of shoots to deer.

from 1953 to 1962 (Figure 6). However, the high
density of trees from the 1930s is anomalous rela-
tive to the plateau at large, and is consistent with
expectations of hunting dogs keeping deer away
from the mid-1920s through the early 1940s.
The exclosure showed rapid proliferation of as-
pen after fencing in 1925 (Figures 6 and 7), but
no aspen established outside the fence between
1910 and 1960. Records taken in 1930, 1942, and
1948 also indicated substantially more conifer
reproduction inside the fence than outside. Field
notes from 1928 stated that outside the fence
‘‘aspen regeneration is 90% utilized.’’ These im-
pacts of deer browsing had a strong legacy over
the next five decades. In 2003, the fenced plot had
the equivalent of 3,570 aspen/ha (average diam-
eter, 14.6 cm; basal area, 60.2 m2/ha), along with
6,010 spruce/ha (average diameter, 13.1 cm; basal
area, 80.7 m2/ha). The unfenced control plot had
the equivalent of 780 aspen/ha (average diameter
6.2 cm; basal area, 2.2 m2/ha) and 5,760 spruce/
ha (average diameter, 8.1 cm; basal area, 29.5 m2/
ha).
Interestingly,
substantial
recruitment
oc-
curred within the exclosure in the 1950s, a period
with very little aspen establishment across the
plateau.
DISCUSSION
The age structure of aspen forests on the Kaibab
Plateau supported the classic story of extremely
high deer populations in the 1920s, Many fewer
aspen date to the 1920s, when the deer irruption
was reported (Figure 4), relative to the long-term
pattern in aspen numbers. The only successful as-
pen recruitment during this period was found in
areas protected from deer by fences or dogs, along
with a few decades-old trees that managed to grow
tall enough to escape deer browse. The age struc-
ture also had three other anomalous periods: dra-
matically higher numbers of aspen in the 1880s/
1890s and from 1968 to 1992, and very low num-
bers from 1952 to 1963. We cannot demonstrate
cause-and-effect
relationships
in
this
historical
pattern, but we can examine the timelines of po-
tential driving factors of climatic variation, fire re-
gimes, livestock and deer populations, and logging
for
consistency
with
each
of
the
anomalous
periods.
Climatic Variation
Climate variations did not appear to have a major
inﬂuence on the age structure of aspen on the
Kaibab Plateau. Based on 5-year classes, the pine
ring-width chronology (Figure 8) correlated well
with the drought index (r2 = 0.45, P < 10)5), but
the correlation of drought with the aspen chro-
nology was weak (r2 = 0.10, P = 0.07). This may
reflect a greater sensitivity of annual pine incre-
ment to climate; the coefficient of variation in
average (5-year) ring widths was 22% for pines and
just 14% for aspen. The pine chronology also re-
lated better to the annual precipitation recorded on
the South Rim of the Grand Canyon (r2 = 0.27,
P = 0.03) than did the aspen chronology (r2 = 0.00,
P = 0.88). The pine chronology showed markedly
stressful conditions for 1873–1884, and 1893–1897
and a prolonged, mildly stressful period from 1943
to 1972. Favorable conditions for pine lasted from
1863 to 1867, 1903 to 1912, 1933 to 1937, and
1973 to 1982. The aspen ring-width chronology
indicated stressful conditions from 1800 through
1822 (except for a better period from 1808 to
1812), from 1853 to 1862, and from 1873 to 1882,
and 1973 to 1982. Periods with favorable condi-
tions were 1823–1832, 1887–1892, and 1958–
1972.
The anomalously high number of aspen from the
1880s and 1890s included periods of both low and
high ring-width increments for aspen and pine.
From 1915 through the 1930s, the low numbers of
aspen trees corresponded to a prolonged period of
average climatic conditions based on the aspen and
pine chronologies and the measured precipitation.

Figure 6. The age structure for aspen at the former site (left) of the Quaking Aspen Ranger Station (where hunting dogs
were said to have kept deer away) showed abundant aspen from the 1930s through the early 1950s, but no stems dated
from the 1920s or from 1953–1962. Aspen recruitment was strong inside the 8 · 8 m exclosure (see Figure 7), particularly
in the 1950s when recruitment was extremely low across the plateau; recruitment was absent in the open plot outside the
exclosure until the 1960s.
Figure 7. Aspen established in plot 28 shortly after fencing of the exclosure in 1927, with the tallest trees reaching 1.4 m
in the 1930s and exceeding 4 m by the end of the 1940s. White bars in 2003 indicate location of original corner posts.

1890s. Prior to 1880, frequent, low-intensity ﬁres
were routine on Kaibab Plateau (Fule´ and others
2002, 2003). Reconstructions of ﬁre history from
ﬁre-scarred trees within the adjacent Grand Can-
yon National Park indicate that ﬁres burned on
average every 4–8 years until 1880, when ﬁres
essentially ceased (Figure 8). The change in fire
regime likely resulted from a reduction in fine fuels
with the onset of livestock grazing (Fule´ and others
2003). The timing of the cessation of fire corre-
sponded to the ten-fold increase in number of as-
pens relative to the long-term trend. Although
some authors have suggested that a reduction in
fires would decrease aspen (Mitchell and Freeman
1993), this insight from infrequent, stand-replacing
fires (Schier 1975) probably does not apply to the

Kaibab Deer Herd

frequent surface fires that were characteristic of the
Kaibab Plateau. Aspen shoots less than 5 or 10
years old would have high mortality rates from
surface fires. We expect that the proximal cause of
the increase in aspen in the 1880s/1890s was the
cessation of fires, and the ultimate cause was live-
stock grazing that altered the fire regime. The
increase in small aspen stems would have dramat-
ically increased the forage supply for deer as an
indirect result of change in fire regime brought
about by livestock grazing. Fires were absent from
most of the plateau through the 20th century, so
any of the later anomalies in the aspen age struc-
ture would not be driven by the fire regime.
Livestock Populations
Livestock herbivory appears to explain none of the
anomalies in aspen numbers. Caughley (1970)
suggested that an increase in the deer population in
the early 1900s could have resulted from an in-
creased availability of forage for deer following
reductions in sheep numbers from 200,000 in 1889
to 5,000 in 1908, citing Russo (1964) as his source.
Botkin
(1990)
cited
Rasmussen
(1941)
and
Caughley (1970) as stating that there were 200,000
sheep and 20,000 cattle on the plateau in 1889,
with declines to 5,000 sheep and few cattle by
1908. The citation of these numbers was mistaken.
Russo (1964; compare Mitchell and Freeman 1993)
quoted the original source of these livestock esti-
mates correctly: ‘‘It is reported that in 1887 and
1889 at least 200,000 sheep and 20,000 cattle were
using the range in the surrounding desert country
and the Kaibab Mountain’’ (Mann 1931, 1941).
These values were regional estimates, not local
numbers for the Kaibab Plateau. Mann (1931,
1941) also stated: ‘‘The earliest indicated extensive
use of the Kaibab Plateau for livestock is in 1885
and 1886 when about 2,000 cattle were placed
there.’’
No records are available of the number of live-
stock on the plateau from 1880 to 1906 (Bostick
1949). Cattle numbers increased from about 9,000
in 1906 to a peak of over 15,000 in 1913 (contrary
to Botkin’s characterization of ‘‘few cattle’’ after
the turn of the century), declining to 7,000 to
10,000 through the mid-1920s, then dropping be-
low 5,000 and remaining at that level (Mann
1941). Estimates of sheep numbers dropped from
an initial 20,000 (‘‘not very accurate,’’ Mann 1941)
to 5,000 by 1910, followed by a steady decline
through the 1940s. In fact, sheep use was largely
restricted to the northern end of the plateau by the
early 1900s (Lang and Stewart 1910), below the
elevational range where most aspen are found. The
classic story of the deer irruption (Figure 1) coin-
cided with sustained high use of the plateau by
cattle (the early phase of the deer irruption was
accompanied by a 50% increase in cattle grazing)
and with the elimination of sheep. The suggested
period of high herbivory and competition between
livestock (especially sheep) and deer (1880s and
1890s, Caughley 1970) coincided with a major in-
crease in aspen numbers (and therefore food supply
for deer). Although the livestock estimates are not
precise or certain, substantial reductions in com-
petition with livestock are unlikely to explain the
irruption of deer, because the deer food supply was
anomalously high during the pre-irruption period.
Deer Populations
The high estimates of deer population in the 1920s
and late 1940s/early 1950s (Figure 1) coincided
with periods of very low numbers of aspen. Esti-
mates of the actual size of deer populations in the
1920s were highly variable, but the presence of
very high numbers of deer in the 1920s was uni-
formly endorsed (Mann 1931, 1941; Rasmussen
1941; Young 2002). The Kaibab Forest Supervisor,
Walter Mann, thought that the estimates improved
from 1930 onward, and he revised earlier Forest
Service estimates from their maximum values of
30,000 deer to ‘‘probably more than 100,000 deer
during 6 six years’’ (1921–1926). A second irrup-
tion was reported in the late 1940s, when the deer
population increased from 21,000 in 1945 to
57,000 in 1949 (Kimball and Watkins 1951, cited in
Russo 1964). Russo’s (1964) population estimates
began with just 17,000 deer in 1950 [only one-
third of the estimate by Kimball and Watkins
[1951], although no mention is made of any major
die-off], rising to 27,000 in 1953–1954 and fol-
lowed by a die-off during the winter of 1954–1955
that reduced the herd to fewer than 10,000. Later
population estimates reached a low of 5,000 in the
late 1970s (Barlow and McCulloch 1984), with
upper limits of 20,000 in the mid 1980s.
Did deer herbivory play a role in the develop-
ment of the age structure of aspen on the Kaibab
Plateau? The order-of-magnitude drop in aspen
numbers for the 1920s coincided with the classic
story of the ﬁrst deer irruption. The paucity of as-
pen supports the idea of the deer irruption, but it
does not directly conﬁrm it. Our conﬁdence in a
causal connection is increased by the age distribu-
tions we found around the site of the Quaking
Aspen Ranger Station (where hunting dogs were
said to keep deer away) and in the exclosures
236
D. Binkely and others

established in 1927. The near-absence of aspen in
the 1950s after the second deer irruption was again
consistent with the major role of deer herbivory in
regulating aspen regeneration.
The abundance of aspen recruitment in the
1880s and 1890s is strong evidence that the deer
population was not limited by food (bottom-up
control of the food web). The near-absence of as-
pen recruitment in the 1920s (and into the 1930s)
would be consistent with a food limitation when
deer populations were high. Was the deer irruption
in the 1920s driven by a reduction in predation
(release from top-down control)? The combined
absence of hunting by humans and the active
predator control program were unprecedented, and
the shift into a food-limited condition is consistent
with this idea. We note that aspen recruitment was
also lower than expected inside the adjacent na-
tional park during this period (Fule´ and others
2002, 2003) (Figure 9), even though predators
were not intentionally controlled within the park
(Young 2002). However, hunting by humans was
prohibited for deer, but continued for predators;
predator hunters ventured regularly into the park
into the 1930s (J. Vaughn and D. Lund, personal
communication). The irruption of deer within the
National Forest may also have spilled over into the
park, swamping the capacity of the remaining
predators to control the deer population (as noted
by Thompson 1934).
Was the food-production capacity of the plateau
reduced in the aftermath of the deer irruption in the
1920s? Reports from the USDA Forest Service clearly
indicate that recovery began rapidly in the 1930s.
Typical excerpts from the annual range condition
reports (summarized in Mann 1941) include:
1926:
Browse on west side made very little
growth.
1927: Favorable conditions for plant growth. . . .
Damage to all conifer reproduction and aspen
cliff rose [Purshia mexicana (D. Don) Henrickson],
and all other browse plants is extensive.

Figure 9. The second irruption of the deer population in the late 1940s (top left) followed a period of sustained predator
control and low hunting (top right). The average rates of increase in deer populations exceeded 5,000/y (bottom left) and
15%/y (bottom right) only in periods following low deer mortality from hunting. Not all periods with low hunting were
followed by rapid increases in deer population (Russo 1964; J. Goodwin, personal communication).
Kaibab Deer Herd
237

1929: West side range is so extensively killed out
as to browse that it does not make a good growth
even in favorable years.
1931:
Aspen sprouts not eaten as closely as
formerly. On the west side one inch of annual
growth of cliff rose had been left uneaten, in
some places 2 inches.
1932: Cliff rose made wonderful growth.
1933: Aspen sprouts were more vigorous than
ever before and were showing recovery. All
brush plants recovering. Deer fat at hunting
time.
The dramatic turnaround in 1931 was attributed
to a 50% die-off of the deer herd in the winter of
1930–1931. By 1935, the condition of the range
appeared to have improved so much that the Forest
Service increased the number of cattle permitted on
the plateau (Bostick 1949). The notations about the
survival of aspen sprouts in the 1930s were cor-
roborated by the subsequent recruitment of aspen
stems (more than 1.4 m tall) in the 1940s. Given
that no major erosion followed the high grazing
(only some back-cutting of gullies was noted,
Bostick 1949), and that the vegetation recovery in
the 1930s was rapid once the deer population
dropped below 20,000, there is no evidence to
support a long-term degradation of deer habitat or
carrying capacity.
Did predation play a major role in the dynamics
of the deer population after 1930? Predator control
continued, including hunting of cougars (Felis
concolor) and trapping of coyotes (Canis latrans)
through the 1940s. Efforts intensified in the 1950s
and 1960s, with widespread, repeated use of poison
baits (Russo 1964, poisoned baits were used once in
the 1920s, but discontinued after the deaths of
several valuable hunting dogs). Hunting by hu-
mans removed an average of 1,600 deer/y after
1930, with a range from 250/y (450/y on a 5-year
average basis, Figure 9) to 8,000/y (4,800/y on a 5-
year average basis). The largest increase in deer
population after 1930 was between 1943 and 1952,
with growth rates exceeding 5,000 deer/y and
15%/y. One other period (1978–1983) had growth
rates exceeding 15%/y for 5 years, but the actual
rate of growth was relatively low (1,600 deer/y)
owing to the low initial population at the beginning
of the period. The 5-year periods of rapid increase
in deer all followed 5-year periods of low hunting

Figure 10. The massive increase in logging in
the mid-1960s (top) [Sesnie and Bailey 2003]
corresponded with the order-of-magnitude
increase in aspen (Figure 8). No logging
occurred in the national park during this
period, and the number of aspen for 1960–
1980 was just 75% greater than the long-term
average (Fule´ and others 2003), in contrast to
more than an order-of-magnitude increase
inside the National Forest.

mortality (one-quarter to one-half of the long-term
average, Figure 9), consistent with the idea that
low rates of predation (by humans in this case)
enabled the deer population to irrupt. Two other
periods also had low hunting mortality (1983–
1988, 1998–2002) but no major increases in deer
population; both of these periods occurred after the
intensive predator control ceased and when the
deer population was quite low. Overall, the two
major irruptions of the deer population in the 20th
century followed periods of major reductions in
predation.
Logging
Minor logging occurred on the plateau from the
late 1800s through World War II (Sesnie and Bailey
2003), followed by increasing commercial harvests
through the late 1980s (Figure 10). Most of this
logging was based on the selection of individual
trees, typically greater than 50 cm in diameter
(D.
Lund,
personal
communication),
and
the
extensive logging was supported by a dense net-
work of roads (few areas of the plateau are more
than 1 km from roads). As logging increased to
more than 150,000 m3/y in the 1960s, the use of
seed-tree harvest regimes increased, and only a few
large trees/ha were retained. The peak in logging
occurred from 1983 through 1987, when almost
300,000 m3/y were removed. Harvests dropped by
about half into the early 1990s and then fell dra-
matically as the mill that processed most of the logs
closed and logging was curtailed because of gos-
hawk (Accipiter gentilis) habitat issues (Reynolds and
others 1992).
The cutting of dominant conifer trees, as well as
disturbance of the soil during logging, would be
expected to increase the regeneration of aspen
(Shepperd and others 2001). Aspen numbers were
more than an order of magnitude above the long-
term trend from 1963 through 1992 (Figure 4),
likely as a result of logging. This inference is sup-
ported by the age structure of aspen across the
boundary in Grand Canyon National Park, where
logging did not occur and aspen numbers did not
differ from the long-term expectation (Figure 10).
Remaining Uncertainties
Our aspen data and summary of historical docu-
ments show that many aspects of the classic Kai-
bab deer story remain uncertain. The overall
trends in deer population were probably robust,
although the actual magnitudes remain imprecise.
The general trend of declining forage production
(for both deer and cattle) through the 1920s was
noted consistently among all observers at the
time, as was the strong recovery in the 1930s. The
dramatic change in ﬁre regime in the 1880s was
abrupt and widespread, leaving very little uncer-
tainty about ﬁre; however, the contribution of the
absence of ﬁre to the order-of-magnitude increase
in aspen recruitment in the 1880s remains an
inference rather than an experimental determi-
nation.
The available information also leaves gaps in the
complete ecosystem story. For example, several of
the historical reports make passing comments
about the impacts of rodent grazing, such as this
note from 1922 (in Bostick 1949):
There are no extensive areas infested with ro-
dents but it has been noted that pocket gophers
[Thomomys
talpoides]
and
ground
squirrels
[Spermophilus lateralis] are on the increase in V.T.
Park and other parks along the highway. . . If
allowed to increase, these rodents will seriously
affect the amount of forage in these parks.
Another
note from the
1930s stated: ‘‘The
ground squirrel, especially, is abundant at the edge
of meadows, enough so as to exercise considerable
pressure on plant growth’’ (in Rasmussen 1941).
One might ask how much of the vegetation story
on the plateau was inﬂuenced by the dynamics in
populations of rodents, and what the impacts of
predator control (especially coyotes and raptors)
might
have been on
the
rodent
populations.
However,
unfortunately,
no
rodent
exclosure
studies were undertaken, and we do not know if
rodents substantially affected long-term vegetation
patterns.
CONCLUSIONS
The classic story of the Kaibab deer popularized by
Aldo Leopold in the 1940s was criticized in the
1970s for making selective use of the available
information (compare Caughley 1970; Burk 1973;
Colinvaux 1973). Unfortunately, these critiques did
not take advantage of the rich vein of information
available from vegetation surveys, fenced exclo-
sures, and revised deer population estimates. Al-
though
population
estimates
were
crude
and
variable, the broad range of evidence was consis-
tent with a major deer irruption in the late 1910s
through the 1920s. The age structure of aspen adds
another line of convergent evidence that supports
the deer irruption. However, the rapid recovery of
aspen recruitment after the deer population drop-
ped below 20,000 in 1930 did not provide evidence
for any general, long-term habitat degradation due
to the irruption.
Kaibab Deer Herd
239

We conclude that Caughley’s (1970) hypothesis
about the reduction of livestock/deer competition
as a driver of the irruption is refuted, based on the
misquotation of livestock numbers and the unlikely
food limitation when aspen recruitment increased
more than an order of magnitude above back-
ground rates.
This aspen increase in the late 19th century
coincided with the cessation of frequent surface
ﬁres across the Kaibab Plateau (Fule´ and others
2002, 2003), and we expect the lack of ﬁre greatly
enhanced the survival of aspen shoots. The dra-
matic increase in aspen recruitment in the late 20th
century probably resulted from widespread logging
on the plateau. These patterns and processes may
have two important implications for the future.
Restoring this historic surface ﬁre regime would
likely reduce aspen recruitment. Similarly, 50-
years of logging in the late 20th century led to a
ten-fold increase in aspen recruitment, and lower
rates of logging in the future would likely promote
less aspen recruitment than in the late 20th cen-
tury. The combination of more frequent ﬁre and
low rates of logging could dramatically decrease
aspen recruitment, but this reduction may repre-
sent a return to historic levels rather than an
unprecedented loss of aspen.
The complexity of this story demonstrates the
challenge of identifying controls on food webs at a
scale of 1,000 km2 and 10–100 years. Historical
evidence may enable some potential driving factors
to be excluded. Year-to-year variations in precipi-
tation had short-term effects on plant production
(as noted in historical documents), and years with
large (and early) snowpacks tended to have high
rates of deer mortality, but climate showed no clear
influence on the recruitment of aspen. Similarly,
large increases in aspen recruitment in the 1880s
refuted the idea that competition with livestock
would have kept deer populations artificially low.
Available evidence may support the importance of
driving factors, but uncertainty about causality re-
mains. The evidence for deer irruptions following
periods of reduced predation was consistent for
both the 1920s and the 1940s, supporting the idea
that predation limits the density of low deer pop-
ulations, and food limits deer populations (and the
absence of aspen recruitment) at high populations.
However, this consistent pattern cannot prove
which factors control the food web. Our results
combine with other case studies (for example,
Gasaway and others 1992; Krebs and others 2003;
Ripple and Beschta 2003, 2004) to indicate that
top-down control of food webs is probably not
unusual in terrestrial ecosystems.
As with many case studies of ecology, wildlife,
and land management, the Kaibab deer story did
not end when Leopold popularized his version. The
ﬁre regime remained outside the range of historical
variation, predator control continued (and inten-
siﬁed with the use of poison baits), and hunting by
humans became a major mortality factor for deer.
The second irruption of deer in the 1940s followed
a period of low predation (hunting) by humans,
consistent with the predation mechanism in the
earlier story. Some uncertainty remains concerning
some of the details of the classic story, but this level
of
ambiguity
is
common
in
almost
all
cases
involving population ecology, land management,
and people (Young 2000, 2002). We suggest that
this uncertainty is an asset in educating students
about the nature of case studies as tests of ecolog-
ical ideas and propose that the complete Kaibab
deer story (and the history of the story) be rein-
stated in ecology textbooks.
