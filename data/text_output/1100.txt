The Ecological Restoration Institute 
The Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University is a pioneer in researching, 
implementing, and monitoring ecological restoration of dry, frequent-fire forests in the Intermountain 
West. These forests have been significantly altered during the last century, with decreased ecological and 
recreational values, near-elimination of natural low-intensity fire regimes, and greatly increased risk of 
large-scale fires. The ERI is working with public agencies and other partners to restore these forests to 
a more ecologically healthy condition and trajectory—in the process helping to significantly reduce the 
threat of catastrophic wildfire and its effects on human, animal, and plant communities.

Executive Summary 
The Schultz Fire was ignited by an abandoned campfire on June 20, 2010, and burned 15,075 acres northeast of 
Flagstaff, Arizona. Following the fire, intense monsoon rains over the burned area produced heavy flooding that 
resulted in extensive damage to properties in neighborhoods downstream from the fire, as well as one death. 
A full-cost accounting of the 2010 Schultz Fire and post-fire flooding was conducted in 2013 (Combrink et 
al. 2013) to capture initial damage over a three-year period. At that time, costs were estimated to be between 
$133 million and $147 million. This analysis builds on and revises the 2013 study to derive a ten-year full-cost 
accounting. This multi-year analysis is a unique contribution to the understanding of the long-term economic, 
ecological, and social effects of a major fire and post-fire flooding. 
The original study (Combrink et al. 2013) estimated a loss in personal wealth due to reduced assessed property 
values in the amount of $59.4 million. The new analysis revealed the difficulty of attributing losses of property 
value to the fire and flooding. After analyzing assessed property values over time, we concluded that the changes 
in value were similar to those in the greater Flagstaff area that were not impacted by the fire and flooding. We also 
found that average assessed property values in the study area had rebounded 51.5% from 2010. Thus, we did not 
include property value changes in our updated full-cost accounting. Removing assessed property values from the 
amount estimated in the original study (Combrink et al. 2013) would have resulted in an estimate of full costs in 
2013 dollars between $73.6 million and $87.6 million.  
Costs associated with the Schultz Fire and flooding continued to accrue over ten years, although at a slower rate than 
during the first analysis. In the current study, the total cost of the Schultz Fire for the ten-year assessment period was 
conservatively estimated to be between $95.8 million and $100.7 million in 2021 dollars, including the fire response 
and post-fire flooding response and mitigation, but excluding all losses and gains related to assessed property values. 
This represents a 30%–15% increase in the respective range of costs from 2013, excluding property values.
The largest costs were incurred by government and utility entities in the amount of $73.4 million over ten years. 
Coconino County and the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service bore the largest expenses. At the same time, 
survey respondents indicated high support and satisfaction related to flood mitigation conducted by both Coconino 
County and the Coconino National Forest, among other agencies. The government and utility expenses were largely 
incurred between 2010 and 2015, which demonstrates that the pace of expenses decreases over time. Nonetheless, the 
most expensive mitigation projects for the post-fire flooding from the 2010 Schultz Fire were incurred in 2015.
The reanalysis of costs associated with habitat loss of Mexican spotted owls benefited from 10 years of data 
collection. Although MSO habitat was severely burned, we learned that no MSO were lost, but rather there was a 
reduction in total habitat and a displacement of the existing owls to nearby suitable habitat. Using three separate 
valuation approaches, the value of the lost MSO habitat is estimated to be between $546,000 to $1,615,000 for 
the 10-year period.
Surveyed households in 2020, a decade after the fire, indicated that they were still experiencing long-term 
well-being and mental health effects. Namely, 25% of respondents shared that the Schultz Fire and subsequent 
flooding has caused significant stress, while just under 20% agreed that their mental health has suffered because of 
fire or flooding.
Individual costs from the updated household survey were estimated to range between $4.6 million to $6.6 
million for insurance-related costs (i.e., insurance, claims, damages) and between $3.4 million to $5.3 million 
for prevention and mitigation measures (i.e., initial costs and upkeep), which represent a range of approximately 

Full-Cost Accounting Remeasurement of the 2010 Schultz Fire: Understanding the Long-term Socio-Economic Implications of High-Severity Wildfire and Post-Wildfire Flooding         3
8% to 12% of the post-fire flooding-related costs. There was also a decline in respondents who said they were 
purchasing flood insurance over time. 
Events like the 2010 Schultz Fire and post-fire flooding can have long-lasting effects that often go 
undocumented. These include long-term financial costs, but also effects that are more difficult to quantify, such 
as those to local ecosystem services and societal costs like community well-being. Long-term studies, such as this 
one, that provide a unique look at the ongoing costs of a major wildfire are important to understand the true scope 
and scale of the effects of uncharacteristic wildfire and post-fire flooding. Studies such as this can provide further 
justification for the importance of proactive forest restoration and fuel reduction treatments to reduce the risk of 
uncharacteristic wildfire to ecosystems and communities.

Introduction  
The Schultz Fire was ignited by an abandoned campfire on June 20, 2010 and burned 15,075 acres northeast of 
Flagstaff, Arizona. Following the fire, intense monsoon rains over the burned area produced heavy flooding that 
resulted in extensive damage to properties in neighborhoods downstream from the fire, as well as one death. The 
flooding continued to a lesser degree in the summers immediately following the fire as flood mitigation projects 
were designed and constructed. In 2013, the total costs of the Schultz Fire were conservatively estimated to be 
between $133 million and $147 million, including the fire response, post-fire flooding response, and mitigation 
costs, as well as assessed property value decreases (Combrink et al. 2013). 
Shortly after the fire, engineering studies and flood mitigation projects were initiated to address post-fire 
flooding (Figures 1 and 2). Since 2013, when the original Combrink et al. (2013) study was published, 
additional flood mitigation projects were completed, which were jointly funded by the Coconino County 
Flood Control District and partner agencies like the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the US Geological Survey (USGS), the Arizona Department of 
Emergency and Military Affairs (AZ DEMA), the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), and the 
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). 
Events at this scale can have long-lasting effects that often go undocumented. These include long-term financial 
costs, but also effects that are more difficult to quantify such as those to local ecosystem services and societal costs 
like community well-being. This study provides a remeasurement of the full costs of the 2010 Schultz Fire and 
post-fire flooding, as well as an assessment of its effects on local communities and ecosystem services in the decade 
that followed. It is a unique look into the ongoing costs of a major wildfire.
The original Schultz Fire full-cost accounting study by Combrink et al. (2013), was conducted in collaboration 
between the Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI) and the Alliance Bank Economic Policy Institute (EPI), 
formerly the Alliance Bank Business Outreach Center. Combrink et al. (2013) conducted a full-cost accounting of 
the Schultz Fire using an analysis of Coconino County Assessor’s records, a survey of residents in the area affected by 
The Schultz Fire was significant because it emphasized the need for forest restoration treatments to 
protect Flagstaff’s municipal watershed, in particular, the Dry Lake Hills north of Flagstaff, which feeds 
into the Rio de Flag watershed, and Mormon Mountain south of Flagstaff, which feeds into Lake Mary—
the main reservoir for the city. In November 2012, a $10 million bond measure was approved by 73.6% 
of voters in Flagstaff to fund the Flagstaff Watershed Protection Project (FWPP), a fuel reduction project 
designed to protect those key watersheds. The Arizona Rural Policy Institute conducted a cost-avoidance 
study for the City of Flagstaff’s FWPP Monitoring Team and estimated potential damage associated with 
wildfire and flooding ranged between $489 and $986 million for the Dry Lake Hills and between $84 
and $215 million for Mormon Mountain in 2014 dollars (Arizona Rural Policy Institute 2014). In 2019, the 
Museum Fire started in the Dry Lake Hills, where fuel reduction work was underway but not complete, 
and burned 1,961 acres near the Schultz Fire burn scar. he predicted post-fire flooding from the Museum 
Fire did not occur due to lack of monsoon moisture in 2019 or 2020. However, flood risk remained in the 
area, and in July 2021, high intensity monsoon storms over the burn scar produced significant flooding 
and damage. Although FWPP and the Museum Fire are important events with respect to the Schultz Fire, 
they are not included as part of the full-cost accounting of the Schultz Fire itself.

the fire and subsequent flooding, and the perceived values of endangered species habitat and human life. In an effort 
to build upon the previous study, an ERI-led team of researchers revisited the 2010 Schultz Fire full-cost accounting 
to document the long-term socio-economic (10 years) costs of the fire and post-fire flooding. This updated full-
cost accounting incorporates costs from the original study, as well as updates costs where appropriate. It includes a 
summary of local government expenditures through 2019, an analysis of the impacts to ecosystem services, results 
from a second survey of households in the affected area exploring long-term economic and social effects, and lessons 
learned and considerations for accounting for the full costs of wildfire over time.   
Study Overview
This remeasurement of the 2010 Schultz Fire full-cost accounting contains four primary sections and three 
appendices. The first section is the updated “Reported Government and Utility Costs from 2010 to 2019” 
and was led by Thomas Combrink at the EPI. The second section is the “Economic Valuation of Mexican 
Spotted Owl Habitat Impacts from Uncharacteristic Wildfire” and was led by Evan Hjerpe at the Conservation 
Economics Institute. This section estimates costs for non-market values, or ecosystem services, for Mexican 
spotted owl (MSO) habitat. Ecological monitoring of MSO since the Schultz Fire indicates that the existing 
owls within the fire footprint were displaced but not lost; thus, there was a reduction in suitable MSO habitat. 
This section includes a comparison of three economic approaches to measuring non-market values using MSO 
habitat as an example. The third section of the study is the “Household Survey” and was led by Catrin Edgeley 
and Jack Burnett of Northern Arizona University’s School of Forestry. This section provides findings from a 
2020 survey of households in the fire and flood footprint area that aimed to understand experiences with the 
Schultz Fire and subsequent flooding; long-term effects of post-fire flooding at the household level; response 
to flood risk, management, and remediation efforts; and perceptions of flood risk reduction efforts at different 
scales. Section 4 provides an updated estimate of the total costs of the 2010 Schultz Fire. We also provide 
lessons learned and considerations for calculating the full costs of wildfire over time. Similar to the original 
Combrink et al. (2013) study, this remeasurement provides a comprehensive but conservative estimate of the 
financial costs and social effects of the Schultz Fire. These methods, although they have not yet been peer-
reviewed, may be applied to other fires, but the costs captured here are specific to the 2010 Schultz Fire and 
subsequent post-fire flooding.
Appendix A provides an analysis of assessed property value changes in the Schultz Fire and flood footprint 
area over the last ten years, including neighborhood-level analyses. The original Combrink et al. (2013) study 
estimated a loss in personal wealth due to reduced assessed property values in the amount of $59,353,523. It is 
important to note that the timing of the 2010 Schultz Fire coincided with national-level decreases in property 
values following the Great Recession of 2008 and the subprime mortgage crisis. Within the study area, parcel 
values were already dropping between 2009 and 2010, the period before the fire and the first flooding event. 
When the original Combrink et al. (2013) study was published, the property values in the area were only just 
beginning to recover. By 2020, average property values in the study area had rebounded 51.5% from an average 
assessed value of $214,940 in 2010 to $325,580 in 2020. This highlights that undertaking a wildfire full-cost 
accounting is complicated by the effects of macro-level events that compound local micro-economic events. 
Macro-economic effects, such as the Great Recession and housing crisis that progressed into 2012, put additional 
pressure on the micro-level economic pressures associated with the Schultz Fire and flooding in 2010 to 2012. 
These macro-level events compound local trends and are difficult to tease apart from assessed housing values in 
the study area. Thus, our total cost calculation (Table 21) does not include changes in assessed property values, as 
was done in the original Combrink et al. (2013) study.

Assessing the Full Costs of Wildfire
In recent decades, there have been numerous efforts to determine the full costs of wildfire. One of the challenges 
of predicting these costs before fires is that every fire is different in terms of weather, fuel conditions, suppression 
activities, values at risk, and other factors, so costs can range widely across time and space. Furthermore, reporting 
on wildfire costs can include varying levels of detail or different types of costs. The Combrink et al. (2013) study 
was a unique effort to expand the financial accounting of a single fire beyond commonly reported costs from city, 
county, state, and federal governments to include more long-lasting and complex costs such as potential changes 
in assessed property values, habitat impacts, loss of life, structural damage, cleanup, unpaid labor, armoring against 
flooding, fire evacuation costs, and flood insurance premiums. The Combrink et al. (2013) study demonstrates 
that the full costs of fire may far exceed the suppression costs. In the case of the Schultz Fire, fire suppression 
accounted for approximately 6–7% of the costs. Other reports have similarly found that the full costs can range 
from 2 to 30 times the cost of fire suppression alone (Western Forestry Leadership Coalition 2010). 
The full costs of wildfire can be explored at different geographic and temporal scales. The Combrink et al. 
(2013) study looked at a single wildfire. Other studies have explored costs across communities. As Headwaters 
Economics (2018) demonstrated, nearly half of wildfire costs are incurred by the local community due to long-
term damages, with the other half being incurred by state or federal entities. They found that suppression accounts 
for 9% of full costs, short-term costs account for 35%, and long-term damages can account for up to 65% of 
total costs (Headwaters Economics 2018). Wildfire costs can also be examined within a single jurisdiction. For 
example, Wang et al. (2021) estimated that economic damages from the 2018 wildfires in California resulted in 
$148.5 billion in costs to the state, 19% of which were capital losses, 22% of which were health costs, and 59% of 
which came from indirect losses. The costs of wildfire can also be examined across the entire country. Thomas et 
al. (2017) determined that the annualized cost of wildfire in 2016 in the US was between $71.1 billion to $347.8 
billion. Lastly, wildfire costs can be explored with respect to their impact on ecosystem services, like clean air and 
water, habitat, or recreational opportunities. Vukomanovic and Steelman (2019) looked at the effects of wildfires 
on ecosystem services and found largely negative effects with increasingly uncharacteristic fires.  
There are also efforts to understand the potential cost savings of forest restoration and fuel reduction treatments 
versus the costs of wildfire suppression and mitigation. In the ponderosa pine forests of northern Arizona, 
treatment costs can range from $471 to $2,100 per acre for mechanical thinning and $12 to $600 per acre for 
prescribed fire (Taylor et al. 2015). The potential cost savings of proactive, preventative forest restoration and 
fuels reduction treatments can be explored using specific cases. For example, Wildish et al. (2020) estimated that 
planned fuel treatments in the Greater Santa Fe Fireshed would generate between $1.44–$1.67 in benefits for 
every dollar invested, with 74% of benefits directly impacting the Santa Fe, New Mexico community. 
In the case of the Schultz Fire, a fuels reduction project called the Jack Smith/Schultz Fuels Reduction and Forest 
Health Project had been planned but not implemented prior to the 2010 fire. Had the 9,662 acres of planned 
mechanical thinning been implemented, it could have cost between $471 and $2,100 per acre (Taylor et al. 2015) 
potentially totaling between $4.8 and $20.3 million in treatment costs for the Jack Smith/Schultz Project. These 
estimates only include treatment costs, not the costs of doing NEPA, personnel, administration of programs, and 
contract oversight. There is also no guarantee that had the Jack Smith/Schultz Project been implemented it would 
have reduced damages from the 2010 Schultz Fire. Nonetheless, the costs of implementing treatments in the area 
could have potentially resulted in millions of dollars in cost savings.

There are numerous studies that explore these long-term costs, but this remeasurement of the full costs of the 
2010 Schultz Fire after ten years is a unique look into the ongoing costs and continuing costs of a major wildfire. 
This study provides insights into continued government and utility costs, impacts on ecosystem services and 
habitat, effects on community well-being, and lessons learned and considerations for wildfire cost accounting. This 
white paper provides important information for policy makers about the long-term effects of wildfire to support 
actions that proactively reduce wildfire risk.

Demographic Characteristics in the Schultz Fire and Flood Footprint
The fire and flood risk area is located within the larger Coconino County Census Tract 13.01. The tract includes 
neighborhoods affected by the fire and floods, as well as the neighborhoods that were not affected. The tract-level 
data are only available in the American Community Survey five-year data series. We explored how Tract 13.01 
has changed for two comparison periods—2006–2010 and 2015–2019—to understand the broader demographic 
context for the fire and flood footprint area. 
Census Tract 13.01 is changing in household composition with fewer children under age 18 and more adults over 
age 65 than in 2010 (Table 1).

While the census tract lost population over the years, the overall economic indicators for those households increased 
(Table 2). Most notably, the population has not grown, and there appears to have been little change over 10 years in 
the study area. The total population has slightly decreased with more households 65 years and over.

Reported Government and Utility Costs from 2010 to 2019
Government agencies and utilities adhere to strict reporting standards for capturing 
wildfire costs. For the 2010 Schultz Fire, suppression costs, which are captured in 
the first column of Table 3, accounted for approximately 6–7% of the total costs of 
the Schultz Fire and associated post-fire flooding as of 2019. In the original Schultz 
Fire full-cost accounting study (Combrink et al. 2013), $39,912,394 in expenses 
were documented from 2010 to 2012, including fire response, flood response, and 
flood mitigation. 
This study updates those expenses slightly by assigning values to the years in which 
tasks were completed and removing projected expenses, as well as adjusting the 
reported numbers in each year to account for inflation to 2021 dollars. These changes 
resulted in a total of $44,521,954 spent between 2010–2012 on fire response, flood 
response, and flood mitigation, as well as added $27,871,037 in expenses from 2013 to 
2019 in 2021 dollars (Table 3). In total, $72,392,991 was incurred in government and 
utility expenses from 2010 to 2019 in 2021 dollars. 
The original study (Combrink et al. 2013) projected flood mitigation expenses for 2012–2014. These projections 
were validated using reported expenses as of 2019. Overall, the accuracy of those projections varied between 
entities but were slightly high for the 2012–2014 time period. For example, Coconino County reported spending 
$3 million more than projected in that time period, while other entities like FEMA spent slightly less than 
projected. Similarly, the expenses projected for 2012–2014 for the FWHA were later incurred in 2015 and were 
slightly less than projected. Projecting exactly when post-wildfire costs may be incurred is difficult due to factors 
such as funding availability and grant spending periods.

Flood Mitigation Projects
A series of floodwater mitigation projects were completed as a result of the Schultz Fire and post-fire flooding. 
The projects were funded jointly by the Coconino County Flood Control District and partner agencies, which 
included the Forest Service, FEMA, USGS, AZ DEM, NRCS, and FHWA. In total, the Schultz flood mitigation 
projects cost a reported $31.462 million (Table 4) between 2010 and 2019, with partner agency funding covering 
$18.93 million (60%) of the costs, not accounting for inflation. 
Some of the projects took place on National Forest System (NFS) lands and involved check dams, sediment 
retention basins and other emergency watershed protection (EWP) projects. Other projects included box culverts 
and retention basins in neighborhoods, as well as roadway realignments (Table 4). Engineering studies were the 
first tasks following the fire and were completed in 2013. The first on-the-ground projects began in 2011; three 
projects occurred in 2012; four projects in 2013; five projects in 2014; and four projects in occurred in 2015, two 
of which were EWP projects that resulted in the highest yearly costs (Figure 1). In 2019, there were additional 
repairs to infrastructure that were a result of damages from a 2018 monsoon event that was not associated with 
post-fire flooding but damaged infrastructure built following the Schultz Fire.

Economic Valuation of Mexican Spotted Owl Habitat Impacts  
from Uncharacteristic Wildfire 
Uncharacteristic wildfire can degrade ecosystem services, or nature’s benefits to 
humans, which results in economic losses to society. Typically, losses from wildfire 
have been assessed based on goods that have markets associated with them such 
as timber. Economic values of market goods, as compared to those of nonmarket 
goods, are easily calculated. However, the majority of ecosystem services on public 
lands are not easily tracked, measured, or understood, nor are they traded in the 
marketplace. Without associated dollar values, nonmarket ecosystem services are 
much more difficult to measure.  
In this section, we value nonmarket ecosystem services for the Mexican spotted 
owl (MSO) (Strix occidentalis lucida). We estimate the costs associated with MSO 
displacement and habitat loss of 1,050 Protected Activity Center (PAC) acres 
resulting from the Schultz Fire. Benefit transfer methods are used to apply previous 
spotted owl valuations from the literature to the valuation of the Schultz Fire’s 
effects on MSO habitat. A net present valuation is conducted to address longitudinal dynamics of lost economic 
value immediately after the Schultz Fire and ten years later.      
Estimates of economic costs associated with degraded MSO habitat represent the lost value from just one 
exemplary ecosystem service adversely affected by uncharacteristic wildfire. Numerous other flora and fauna and 
ecosystem functions and processes can be adversely affected by wildfires that burn more intensely than historically 
normal. Likewise, a number of ecosystem services can be enhanced by moderate wildfire in fire-dependent forests, 
or portions of a wildfire that fall within the historical range of variability (HRV). Additionally, some wildfire 
can generate more benefits than costs for spotted owls, particularly the California spotted owl (e.g., Lee 2018). 
Because of this, our estimates of costs associated with lost MSO habitat acres within the fire footprint should be 
considered only a portion of the total costs to ecosystem service from the Schultz Fire.  
To estimate the benefits of species preservation, economic methods were developed to conduct nonmarket 
valuation where conservation and preservation values are determined by society’s willingness to pay (WTP) for 
ecosystem services ranging from the production of clean water, to recreation, to just knowing that animals will 
have available and healthy habitat.  
Background
With the spotted owl controversy in the early 1990s, there was a flurry of nonmarket valuations of spotted 
owls. Rubin et al. (1991) conducted one of the first contingent valuation studies of the northern spotted owl, 
finding mean annual WTP values ranging from $15–$37 per household for conservation policies that would 
ensure survival of the species by foregoing logging. Rubin et al. (1991) extrapolated sample estimates from the 
Pacific Northwest to the rest of the nation to estimate almost $1.5 billion of economic benefit (or societal WTP) 
associated with protecting spotted owl habitat. Hagen et al. (1992) published another contingent valuation of a 
conservation policy to protect the northern spotted owl, finding mean annual WTP of $86 per household. For the 
MSO, we are only aware of one study that estimated the conservation value of protecting the species. Loomis and 
Ekstrand (1997) found a mean WTP of $40 per household, resulting in a national economic benefit of $2 billion 
for conservation management on 4.6 million acres of Southwest forests.  
With the listing of the northern spotted owl as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act in 1990, and the 
subsequent listing of the MSO in 1993, timber harvest in forest habitat associated with spotted owls was nearly

eliminated. But new, emerging threats were affecting the survival of the species, such as uncharacteristic wildfire 
(Jones et al. 2021) and invasions of other owl species (barred owls). Interest grew in accounting for nonmarket 
values in the economic analysis of wildfire management (e.g., González-Cabán and Chase 1992, González-Cabán 
1993), leading to a series of studies valuing the WTP for wildfire reduction programs in spotted owl forests that 
found strong WTP from the public (Table 5).

The literature on economic valuations of protecting spotted owls represents a fairly small sample size, dominated 
by a couple of researchers. As the primary studies were all conducted in the 1990s following the Northwest Forest 
Plan implementation, uncertainty exists about whether the public would still value spotted owls in a similar 
manner and if the spotted owl would have a less prominent role amongst the ever-growing environmental and 
conservation concerns encircling western forests (e.g., climate change). Regardless of temporal trends, all estimates 
of the conservation value of the spotted owl and its habitat have demonstrated that benefits greatly outweigh the 
costs of protection programs and have illustrated the economic efficiency of spotted owl habitat conservation plans 
(see Appendix B for more detailed background, literature review, and methods).  
Comparison of Three Economic Approaches and Findings 
In this section, we discuss the methods for applying spotted owl valuations to the Schultz Fire. The Schultz 
Fire in 2010 was an uncharacteristically intense wildfire, resulting in crown fires that burned through portions 
of three MSO PACs. Ecological monitoring by wildlife biologists documented that the Schultz Fire resulted 
in high severity burns on approximately 1,050 MSO PAC acres but did not result in any MSO loss, but rather 
a reduction in total habitat and a displacement of the existing owls within the fire footprint to nearby suitable 
habitat (personal communication with Shaula Hedwall, US Fish and Wildlife Service, on May 3, 2021). The 
synthesized owl values from Table 5 provide averages for WTP to protect and ensure the survival of the entire 
MSO species. For our application, we needed to understand the marginal cost of losing 1,050 MSO PAC acres to 
uncharacteristic, high severity wildfire, as opposed to losing the entire MSO species and all its habitat. Applying 
the overall average WTP in the literature is not appropriate when estimating marginal changes (e.g., Montgomery 
and Adams 1994).

Willingness-to-pay values for protection are known as “benefits” in cost-benefit analysis. When that protection is 
lost, these values become “costs.” To estimate the “costs” of losing MSO habitat to the Schultz Fire, we must assess 
how much protection, or public benefit, was reduced. That is, the lost ecosystem services and their correlating 
societal benefits can be approximated by a portion of the total WTP that is represented by the Schultz Fire burn 
area. To do this, we applied three types of benefit transfer—value unit, measure of central tendency, and function 
transfer—using derived per-acre WTP estimates. Benefit transfer is conducted by transferring primary estimates 
from a source study to a new policy site. In this case, we transferred values from multiple spotted owl studies to 
our policy site of MSO habitat in and around Flagstaff, Arizona and those included within the Schultz Fire.    
For all three types of transfers, we focused on the displacement of MSO habitat from three PACs within the 
fire footprint, or 1,050 acres of the Schultz Fire that burned with high severity. When presented with modeling 
alternatives, we chose the conservative options to err on the side of underestimating WTP to protect MSOs from 
uncharacteristic wildfire (see Appendix B for more information).
Unit Value Transfer 
The simplest benefits transfer used mean estimates from the one source study that measured WTP for protecting 
MSOs and their habitat (Loomis and Ekstrand 1997). Given the time gap between the Loomis and Ekstrand 
study (1997), the Schultz Fire (2010), and the present (2021), our use of Loomis and Ekstrand’s estimates can be 
considered a temporal benefit transfer. Loomis and Ekstrand (1997) estimated annual household average WTP 
of $40 to protect MSOs. Updated to 2021 dollars, mean annual WTP per household for protecting MSOs is $66. 
As MSOs are a threatened species that exists mostly on public lands, the sampling frame to determine WTP was 
throughout the US. These values held for MSOs can be extrapolated to all US households as done by Loomis and 
Ekstrand (1997). They conservatively estimated $2 billion of total annual WTP for the US.1 Updated to 2021 
dollars, provides an annual WTP of $3.3 billion to protect the MSO.   
Transferring unit values from source studies of total WTP for protecting spotted owls is the first step in 
estimating the marginal costs associated with the displacement of two MSO PACs from the Schultz Fire. To 
go from total costs to marginal costs, we divide total WTP ($3.3 billion) by the number of MSO habitat acres 
presented in the original valuation (4.6 million acres). This provides a WTP of $717 per acre. When applying this 
value to the human-caused Schultz Fire burn area, we can assess the value based on a loss of 1,050 acres. Using 
this approach, we estimate that the adverse fire effects on MSOs and their habitat led to a reduction in societal 
welfare of approximately $753,000.  
Assuming the loss of 1,050 MSO habitat acres within the fire footprint, the unit value transfer produces a societal 
welfare loss, or cost, of $753,000.
Measure of Central Tendency Value Transfer
A second method of unit value transfer can be conducted by identifying and synthesizing multiple viable source 
studies. This is called “measure of central tendency value transfer” and is a method used by Rosenberger and 
Loomis (2003). Table 6 illustrates the four studies that valued the WTP for protecting spotted owls, and their 
forested habitat, from intense wildfires. Because there has been no contingent valuation specifically conducted on 
wildfire prevention programs and MSOs, we assumed the valuations for NSOs and CSOs, as conducted in the 
source studies (Table 6), are transferable to MSOs and the Schultz Fire.   
1	  Loomis and Ekstrand (1997) report national WTP ranging from $2 billion to $3.7 billion based on treatment of non-respondents. The higher 
number assumed non-respondents have the same WTP as respondents. The more conservative, and lower, estimates incorporate the assumption 
that non-respondents have a zero WTP.

Table 6 displays per-acre WTP values for three fire prevention and control programs that would reduce the 
number of acres burned in spotted owl habitat (ranging from a 20%–50% annual reduction of spotted owl acres 
burned annually). Per-acre WTP estimates were derived by dividing mean annual WTP estimated for the US by 
the total number of spotted owl acres spanning fire prevention programs.

*The Loomis and González-Cabán (1994) extrapolation of Oregon WTP to the US is likely very conservative, as they estimated the rest of the nation’s WTP at only 
10% of the mean WTP for the sample frame. The follow-up studies conducted in California and New England states illustrate the conservative nature of this estimate.   
When synthesizing the three final per-acre WTP values, we could have chosen the mean ($1,538/acre) or the 
median ($1,614). As in previous steps, we chose the more conservative measure, which is the mean. Applying the 
mean WTP values to the loss of 1,050 MSO PAC acres in the Schultz Fire yields a total loss of $1.615 million 
($1,538 x 1,050 acres).  
Assuming the loss of 1,050 MSO habitat acres within the fire footprint, the measure of central tendency value transfer 
produces a societal welfare loss, or cost, of $1,615,000.
Benefit Function Transfer
For the benefit function transfer, we utilized Loomis and González-Cabán’s (1998) WTP function for protecting 
acres of spotted owl habitat from fire. They estimate WTP using the measurement from Hanemann’s (1984) 
formula for calculating median WTP for households. To transfer Loomis and González-Cabán’s (1998) WTP 
function to Schultz Fire MSO habitat losses, we started by estimating variables for the state of Arizona to transfer 
results from California-derived WTP to Arizona-derived WTP for protecting MSOs. Loomis and González-
Cabán (1998) illustrate coefficients for six explanatory variables used to determine average WTP, including 
loss of acres (i.e., expected reduction in spotted owl acres burned); old growth existence values; importance of 
general environmental quality, household income, age, and whether respondents were financial supporters of 
environmental organizations. Of the six explanatory variables, we were able to attain equivalent metrics for 
Arizona for two of the variables: mean income and age.   
The Hanemann (1984) formula was used to determine median WTP with an assumption of 20 percent reduction 
in number of spotted owl acres burned, resulting in an estimated median Arizona household WTP of $50 
compared to the Loomis and González-Cabán’s (1998) median estimate of $56 for California. We inflated to 
2021, resulting in $82 per household for Arizona. Conservatively, we only extrapolated our estimated median

WTP to 50% of households to account for Loomis and González-Cabán’s (1998) 50% response rate. Additionally, 
households below the poverty line are unlikely to have discretionary income to use for environmental protection, 
so we subtracted these households from our WTP extrapolation as done in Hjerpe and Hussain (2016). Loomis 
and González-Cabán (1997) estimated WTP for households in New England states, thousands of miles away 
from the study site, at 65% of the regional sample WTP in Oregon and California. Given the higher income rates 
in New England states, we conservatively assume that the rest of the US households would have a mean WTP of 
approximately 50% of the Arizona estimated WTP.  
We started the extrapolation with the state of Arizona and its 2.67 million households and removed 13.5% of 
households (US Census Bureau 2019) below the poverty level, leaving 2.31 million Arizona households. With 
125 million households in the rest of the US, minus the state of Arizona, we removed 10.5% of households below 
the poverty level, leaving approximately 112 million households. We reduced our total applicable households by 
50% to accord with the response rate found in Loomis and González-Cabán (1998), leaving 1.16 million eligible 
Arizona households and 56 million of the rest of the US households.  
Applying the median AZ WTP of $82 and the remaining median US WTP of $41 to eligible households resulted 
in approximately $2.4 billion of total WTP. Dividing this total by the 4.6 million acres of MSO habitat (Loomis 
and Ekstrand 1997), gave us a WTP of $520 per acre. Multiplying this value by 1,050 acres of MSO PAC acres 
that burned with high severity, results in $546,000 in lost societal value.  
Assuming the loss of 1,050 MSO habitat acres within the fire footprint, the benefit function transfer produces a 
societal welfare loss, or cost of $546,000.
Final Results
Based on three types of benefit transfer, the range of costs stemming from the loss of 1,050 MSO habitat acres 
within the fire footprint was estimated to be between $546,000 and $1,615,000.  
Estimates of MSO Habitat Losses from the Schultz Fire Over Time
Because effects of uncharacteristic wildfire can persist for many years, it is important to understand the 
longitudinal trajectory of associated wildfire costs. Our estimated costs were annual estimates for MSO habitat 
losses from the Schultz Fire. Thus, as long as the MSO habitat stays in its new and unusable condition, annual 
WTP for MSO habitat losses can be aggregated for total loss estimates from the Schultz Fire over time. To 
account for wildfire cost persistence, and to appropriately account for monetary inflation, economists can conduct 
a net present valuation (NPV) to qualify MSO habitat loss costs over time. NPV is the process of summing the 
annual costs (or benefits) resulting from the Schultz Fire, where revenue sums are discounted into the future to 
account for society’s preference for money now as opposed to money in the future. In other words, NPV is the 
discounted marginal value of altered forest ecosystem services over time.  
We used the annual WTP estimates for the lost MSO habitat acres, as quantified in the prior results section, 
to project costs into the future and discount them back to present dollars. To align with cost-benefit analysis 
performed by the Forest Service in land management planning, we incorporated two discount rates2 in our NPV 
analysis, which helped bracket future uncertainty for both monetary inflation and biological dynamics.  
 
 
 
2	  OMB Circular A-4 — Regulatory Analysis (Sept. 17, 2003) requires use of two discount rates (both 3% and 7%). It should be noted, however, 
that some economists suggest the use of a zero (or even negative) discount rate when valuing intact ecosystems for future generations, lending 
greater preference for future ecosystem values.

We projected out costs for 20 years—as we expect MSO habitat degradation to last at least that long—under the 
three WTP cost estimates presented in the results section. Table 7 illustrates that if the MSO acres that burned 
with high severity persist as unsuitable habitat for MSOs for the next 20 years, the net present value of lost 
conservation benefits ranges from approximately $6 million to $24 million.

Based on three types of benefit transfer and a 20-year timeframe, the net present value of costs stemming from the loss 
of 1,050 MSO habitat acres within the fire footprint is estimated to be between $5.78 million to $24.03 million.  
Discussion
In terms of summarizing the costs associated with MSO habitat losses and the Schultz Fire, we offer a few words 
of caution. While contingent valuation of nonmarket ecosystem services is an inexact science, uncertainty related 
to monitoring of biophysical attributes and processes and their influence on MSO habitat selection can cloud the 
ability for accurate economic valuations of MSOs. It is difficult to find funding and maintain detailed ecological 
monitoring across numerous forests. But ecological monitoring, before and after a wildfire, is necessary to 
understand changes in MSO habitat due to fire, the potential for future MSO habitat within burn perimeters, and 
the resulting economic values held by society for protecting MSOs from uncharacteristic wildfire.  
On the other hand, we incorporated conservative methods for our estimates of WTP. Additionally, our accounting 
stance, which incorporated all eligible US households, may have been too limited given evidence of cross-border 
species and international WTP for protecting endangered species (Haefele et al. 2018). Having spotted owl source 
studies that were well aligned methodologically was helpful for our estimates. 
Overall, we found the Schultz Fire spurred annual losses of societal conservation benefits related to protecting 
the MSO that ranged from $546,000 to $1,615,000. When accounting for the likely persistence of MSO habitat 
losses over the next 20 years, we estimated net present values ranging from $5.78 million to $24.03 million. 
It is difficult to compare our estimates to the estimates in the original Combrink et al. (2013) study, as more 
time was needed to determine the effects on MSO habitat. We can say that these annual estimated losses have 
been accumulating for the last eleven years since the Schultz Fire and will continue to accumulate in the near 
future. Finally, MSO habitat is only one of many nonmarket ecosystem services that can be degraded from 
uncharacteristic wildfire, meaning that our economic estimates are vastly underestimating total costs. Other 
important, nonmarket ecosystem services include things like clean water or air, cultural or ethical values, recreation 
opportunities, or natural hazard preventions.

Household Survey  
Overview
Data collection to determine household impacts associated with post-fire flooding 
is rare, particularly regarding undocumented expenses and the role of insurance in 
household recovery. The original 2011 survey of Schultz-area households conducted 
by Combrink et al. (2013) was one of the earliest efforts to systematically document 
economic losses after post-fire flooding, determining household-level out-of-pocket 
expenses rarely captured in traditional post-fire analyses. Our 2020 survey sought to 
replicate core questions from the 2011 survey and introduce new questions designed 
to understand how these expenses and experiences have evolved over the past 
decade. In this section, we discuss the findings of the 2020 household survey, with 
the intent to provide a temporal comparison of economic implications for residents 
and capture undocumented long-term consequences to Coconino County residents.
Approach
Household-level surveys are a methodological tool used to capture changes in 
impacts and attitudes around fire and associated secondary hazards over time. The original full-cost accounting 
study of the Schultz Fire included a mail survey distributed to 1,339 affected households. That study received 
321 responses for a 24% response rate. We replicated this effort—with a slightly expanded focus on sampling 
households in the projected 100-year flood event area—in the fall of 2020. This sample’s focus on long-term 
risk represents a slight expansion on the 2011 sample, which was concerned predominantly with flooded areas. 
A mixed-mode survey was administered to 1,802 households in the area, which resulted in 407 completed 
questionnaires for a 22.6% response rate. 
Survey materials were mailed to households beginning in early October 2020. Each household received materials 
in three phases: 1) an introductory letter with information about the study, a questionnaire booklet and a pre-paid 
return envelope; 2) a postcard reminder one week later; and 3) a final reminder letter after an additional two weeks 
to incentivize responses from those yet to participate. Respondents also had the option to complete the survey 
online; a link to this format was provided in each mailout. The survey instrument is included in Appendix C.
Survey questions spanned six topics: 1) information about the respondent’s property and experience with the Schultz 
Fire and subsequent flooding; 2) property effects associated with flooding, including insurance claims and mitigation 
actions; 3) efforts to address community flood risk; 4) respondent well-being since the Schultz Fire; 5) respondent 
concerns and priorities for landscape recovery after the Schultz Fire; and 6) basic socio-demographic information. 
The last page included space for participants to share additional comments. Questions were designed to solicit 
responses from both residents who lived in the area during the fire in 2010 and those who had moved into the area 
since the Schultz Fire. Unfortunately, the 2011 survey did not associate responses with household addresses, so we 
were unable to determine how many households responded to both the 2011 and 2020 surveys. This second survey 
effort also shifted away from highly detailed questions about expenses and costs requested in the 2011 survey given 
that participant efforts to recall 10 years of itemized expenses is unlikely to yield accurate responses. 
Survey Findings
Basic Respondent Information
The average survey respondent was 63 years old. Approximately 50% of respondents identified as male, 49.5% as 
female, and 0.5% indicated “other.” The majority of respondents (99.2%) owned their property and resided there 
full time (88.3%), with an average parcel size of 2.2 acres. Respondent ethnicity was predominantly white (86.7%);

7.5% identified as American Indian or Alaskan native, 1.1% as Asian, 1.1% as Black or African American, 3.9% as 
Hispanic or Latino, 0.3% as native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and 3.3% as something not listed. Respondents 
reported a higher-than-average household income; 79% earned $60,000 or more a year before taxes compared 
to Coconino County’s median income of $57,616 and the census track average of $86,591 that the surveyed 
population lies in (US Census Bureau 2019). Respondents had generally received a high level of education, 
with 69.9% of respondents holding a four-year degree or a more advanced qualification. Respondents were 
representative based on the most recent census data for this area.
Experiences with the Schultz Fire and Subsequent Flooding
Approximately 71% of respondents (281 respondents) moved into their property prior to the Schultz Fire. A 
minority of respondents (13.5%) were concerned about potential flood risk when they moved into their property, 
while a larger number of respondents (37.7%) were concerned about potential wildfire risk. More than half of all 
respondents (51.3%) moderately or strongly agreed that they knew an event like the Schultz Fire and flood could 
happen in this area. Responses indicate that those who moved in after the Schultz Fire had a greater awareness of 
fire and flood risk when they moved into the area in comparison to those who lived there prior (Table 8). 
When asked about current flood risk to their property, more than half (56.9%) of respondents indicated that it 
was low (Figure 3). Residents whose property had been flooded during the Schultz Fire (131 respondents) were 
far more likely to report concern about future flood (44.1% of those whose properties had flooded versus 12.6% 
of those whose had not flooded before). Given the long-term effects fire can have on local hydrology, respondents 
were asked to indicate how long they anticipated post-fire flood risk to last; only 21.8% responded that the risk 
was no longer present (Figure 4).

Long-Term Outcomes of Post-Fire Flooding at the Household Level
Several questions from the 2011 survey instrument were replicated in the 2020 survey (see Appendix C for 2020 
Survey Instrument) to allow for comparisons related to flooding and its outcomes at the household level over time. 
The findings presented below compare data from both surveys wherever available. In the following sections we 
examine consequences related to insurance, finances, and well-being at the household level between 2010 to 2020. 
Respondents reporting that they were affected in the following sections are predominantly those who moved into 
the area before the Schultz Fire began, therefore we did not split the data by respondents who had tenure in the 
area starting before and after 2010.
Flood Insurance
Many respondents reported purchasing flood insurance annually in the years following the Schultz Fire: a total 
of 126 respondents (39%) self-reported holding flood insurance in the 2011 survey, while 69 (17%) reported that 
they still renewed flood insurance annually in 2020. A subset (55 respondents, or the total 69 respondents) shared 
the annual cost to renew their insurance, which had increased significantly since 2011 (Table 9).

Given this decline in annual flood insurance renewal between both surveys, respondents who no longer purchase 
flood insurance were asked to provide the final year they renewed. Figure 5 displays a peak in non-renewals in 
2012, and most non-renewals ended by the end of 2015.

Approximately a third of respondents (131 respondents) from the 2020 survey reported damage from flooding at 
some point since the Schultz Fire, compared to the higher value of 45% (146 respondents) who reported damage 
in the 2011 survey. The type of damage incurred also varied between the 2011 and 2020 surveys as shown in 
Table 11. All types of reported damage decreased from 2011 to 2020, while those who reported no flood damage 
increased from 46.2% in 2011 to 74.4% in 2020.

typically included: debris/mud removal, landscaping, lost rental income, loss of pasture for livestock, flooding in 
living areas of house, landscaping and fencing losses, driveway, and patio or deck loss. In 14 instances, claims were 
not filed because the damages occurred within the 30-day period before flood insurance came into effect. The 
average cost of damages for which an insurance claim was not made are presented in Table 13.

Effects of the Schultz Fire on Well-Being Between 2011–2020
One frequently overlooked consequence of wildfires and post-fire flooding is well-being, which can be assessed 
through survey methods. The survey asked participants to self-report responses to a number of questions related 
to mental health, physical health, and well-being since the Schultz Fire. Negative well-being outcomes were 
predominantly documented among those who lived in the area during the Schultz Fire; those who moved into the 
area since 2010 rarely reported negative consequences to their well-being associated with the fire and flooding. 
The following statistics summarize key impacts to well-being documented at any point in the last ten years 
following the Schultz Fire:
• 
18.9% of respondents moderately or strongly agreed that their mental health suffered as a result of the fire
• 
12% of respondents moderately or strongly agreed that their physical health suffered as a result of the fire 
• 
25.3% experienced significant stress as a result of the Schultz Fire 
• 
8.3% of respondents reported that pre-existing health conditions were worsened by the Schultz Fire
• 
4.4% of respondents reported that they are still experiencing health issues related to the Schultz Fire at 
the time of our 2020 survey
• 
14.5% of respondents do not like living in the area as much since the Schultz Fire and flooding events.
These statistics indicate a spectrum of current well-being across the population in this study.
Response to Flood Risk, Management, and Remediation Efforts
Mitigation and remediation efforts to address heightened flood risk after the Schultz Fire occurred on both public 
and private lands. This section explores the type and cost of work conducted on private property, and resident 
perceptions of remediation on public land.
Flood Risk Mitigation and Costs on Private Property
Respondents were asked to report the flood mitigation efforts they had undertaken on their property, and the 
approximate time frame in which they implemented each activity. Table 15 provides an overview of this data. 
Sand bag placement was the most commonly reported action, completed by 47.6% of respondents—the majority 
of whom began this activity immediately after the fire. Less common mitigation efforts typically involved more 
financial and time investment, and often required some form of permanent construction or home modification. 
Respondents were also able to report actions not listed in the survey; the most common addition was creation or 
improvement of berms.
 
Surveyed households in 
2020, a decade after the 
fire, indicated they were 
still experiencing long-term 
well-being and mental 
health effects. Namely, 
25% of respondents shared 
that the Schultz Fire and 
subsequent flooding has 
caused significant stress, 
while just under 20% agreed 
that their mental health has 
suffered because of fire or 
flooding. Photo courtesy

Respondents also were able to report influences on their decisions not to undertake some mitigation efforts. Those 
responses are shown in Table 16. Many indicated they believed flood risk to their property was too low to warrant 
extensive mitigation work. Several options received neutral responses—including the cost of mitigation activities, 
time required, cost of upkeep, and aesthetic changes caused by mitigation—indicating that these outcomes or 
requirements had little influence on respondents’ decisions not to mitigate.

Many of these mitigation efforts were not covered by insurance. While some materials such as sandbags were 
provided by Coconino County, other efforts incurred out-of-pocket costs to the homeowner. Table 17 reviews 
household costs for preventative measures across both the 2011 and 2020 surveys. The average cost of preventative 
measures on private property has doubled since 2011.

Perceptions of Flood Risk Reduction Efforts at Different Scales
Existing research indicates that perceptions of responsibility can be highly influential in household decisions 
to conduct risk mitigation efforts. Perceptions of unmet responsibility can also lead to local conflict if left 
unaddressed. The survey assessed respondent perceptions across different land ownerships, with a focus on 
determining whether enough has been done to reduce risks associated with those lands. The majority of 
respondents moderately or strongly agree that work on the Coconino National Forest and Coconino County 
right-of-way is enough to safely reduce flood risk. 
Determining who the public feels should be responsible for flood risk mitigation is helpful for tailoring local 
messaging and communication around land management and flooding. Survey participants were provided with a 
list of different groups and asked to indicate the extent to which they agreed or disagreed that responsibility for 
flood risk mitigation should be borne by them (Table 19). Respondents widely agreed that all parties listed carried 
responsibility for mitigation, including themselves as property owners. This aligns with responses from a recent 
survey of Flagstaff residents affected by the 2019 Museum Fire, where there was near unanimous agreement that 
efforts to address wildfire risk reduction would be most successful when addressed collaboratively (Edgeley and 
Colavito 2020).
Additional analysis indicates that respondents whose properties were damaged by post-fire flooding following the 
Schultz Fire were more likely to agree that responsibility for risk mitigation lies with the property owner. Those 
who purchased and renewed flood insurance for their Schultz-area property were also more likely to agree that 
responsibility for mitigation lies with FEMA.

Survey participants were also asked which mediation measures caused the most notable decreases in risk to their 
private property. Table 20 reviews responses, indicating that ditches, new channel construction, and emergency 
stabilization efforts in the burned area were perceived as most successful. The latter indicates high public support 
for Burned Area Emergency Response teams, and a public recondition of the value of federal and county risk 
mitigation in cross-boundary risk reduction.

Discussion and Conclusions
Household impacts from the Schultz Fire and subsequent flooding remain prevalent more than a decade later. 
Most notably, expenses associated with flood damages, mitigation, and maintenance have continued to increase 
since the 2011 survey. 
Efforts to repair property damage caused by flooding typically take over two years, but some respondents were still 
working on repairs at the time of the survey. Many of these repairs were out of pocket as respondents either did 
not have insurance coverage or considered it unworthy of an insurance claim. The average affected household has 
spent $12,111 on uninsured damages; for damages that were covered, claims typically only covered a little over 
half the estimated cost of damage. Out-of-pocket costs have shifted from implementation of flood risk mitigation 
such as ditches and berms to their long-term maintenance and upkeep. Purchase and renewal of flood insurance

began to decrease in 2012, just two years after the Schultz Fire. This indicates that for populations near areas with 
long-term post-fire flood risk, communication and outreach efforts should be reengaged around this time. 
Our survey also indicates that some long-term consequences are associated with well-being and mental health. A 
quarter of respondents shared that the Schultz Fire and subsequent flooding caused significant stress, while 18.9% 
agreed that their mental health suffered because of fire or flood events and outcomes.
There are significant differences in how those who lived in the area before and after June 2010 responded to survey 
prompts, particularly those associated with risk. Newer residents reported greater awareness and consideration of 
both flood and fire risk upon moving to the area. This indicates an opportunity to capitalize on this interest and 
engage newcomers on arrival to conduct property mitigation, participate in collective efforts to address risk, and 
purchase flood and fire insurance coverage among other proactive activities. Furthermore, respondents indicated high 
support and satisfaction related to flood mitigation conducted by both the Coconino County and Coconino National 
Forest, among other agencies. This finding aligns with previous research that highlights a strong understanding of 
shared responsibility across members of the public (Edgeley and Colavito 2020). Together, these data suggest that 
residents in the areas affected by Schultz Fire flooding continue to be amenable to discussions about long-term flood 
risk mitigation on both private and public lands at a range of scales.
Household-level costs extrapolated from the survey 
were estimated to range between $4.6 million to $6.6 
million for insurance-related costs and between $3.4 
million to $5.3 million for prevention and mitigation 
measures, which represent a range of approximately 
8% to 12% of the post-fire flooding-related costs.

Total Costs
The long-term costs of the 2010 Schultz Fire, as estimated in 2021 and not 
including assessed property values as was done in the original study (Combrink et 
al. 2013), together yield a conservative full-cost estimate of approximately $98.3 
million (Table 21). These costs represent some of the more complex and difficult to 
measure costs of wildfire and post-fire flooding.
The estimates for government and utility expenses, MSO habitat displacement, 
insurance, and prevention and mitigation measures were updated using new data 
and methods. The government and utility expenses were reported values incurred 
in specific calendar years. We gathered additional reported expenses from 2013 to 
2019 for this study, adjusted these expenses to account for inflation to 2021 dollars, 
and calculated a total of $72.4 million in government and utility expenses. 
The habitat valuation was updated to account for recent biological information 
regarding the effects of the 2010 Schultz Fire on MSO PACs in the fire footprint. 
The original Combrink et al. (2013) study estimated that four MSO PACs were 
affected by the fire. As of 2021, we know that while the MSO habitat was affected by the 2010 Schultz Fire, there 
was no MSO loss, rather a reduction in total habitat and a displacement of the existing owls to nearby suitable 
habitat. The adjusted habitat valuation estimates were derived using three different economic approaches that 
produced a range of $546,000 to $1.6 million. We used the mean of this range (which is also reported) to calculate 
our total costs on MSO habitat (Table 21). 
Table 21. Total estimated costs of the 2010 Schultz Fire as of 2021; the costs for 1) loss of life; 2) structural damage; 3) cleanup; 4) unpaid labor; 5) home 
contents; and 6) fire evacuation were not updated from the Combrink et al. (2013) study but were adjusted to account for inflation to 2021 dollars. Where 
available, range of costs are presented.

The original Combrink et al. (2013) study was able to capture more detailed information from households 
affected by the fire. The estimates for: 1) loss of life; 2) structural damage; 3) cleanup; 4) unpaid labor; 5) home 
contents; and 6) fire evacuation costs were not remeasured in this study but the costs captured in Combrink et 
al. (2013) were updated to account for inflation to 2021 dollars. Our remeasurements from the household survey 
focused on flood insurance costs and claims, as well as the costs of preventative measures and upkeep of those 
measures. Because the survey respondents were deemed to be representative of the broader study area with a non-
response bias survey, we were able to extrapolate out the reported survey responses for: 1) flood insurance costs

(Table 9); 2) insurance claims (Table 12); 3) damages not covered by insurance (Table 13); 4) preventative measure 
costs (Table 17); and 5) upkeep of preventative measure costs to the entire study area (Table 18). We calculated a 
range of $4.6 million to $6.6 million for insurance-related costs (i.e., insurance, claims, damages) and a range of 
$3.4 million to $5.3 million for prevention and mitigation measures (i.e., initial costs and upkeep). We used the 
means of these ranges to calculate the total costs (Table 21).  
We also estimated the potential cost savings that could have been incurred by treating a significant portion of 
the Schultz Fire footprint. Using information from the Jack Smith/Schultz Project, which was planned but not 
implemented prior to the 2010 Schultz Fire, we estimated that treatments could have cost between $471 and 
$2,100 per acre and $12 to $600 per acre for prescribed fire (Taylor et al. 2015). This would have represented a 
$12 to $2,100 per acre cost to treat the area affected by the Schultz Fire, potentially totaling between $4.8 and 
$20.3 million in total treatment costs for the Jack Smith/Schultz Project. Using the updated estimates of the total 
long-term costs of the Schultz Fire of $98.3 million, we estimated a $6,517 per-acre full cost, assuming 15,075 
acres burned. Thus, there could have been a potential cost savings of between $78 million and $93.5 million had 
the area been treated, which would represent an approximate return of six times the amount invested. This is a 
rough estimate that includes numerous assumptions about how treatments might have affected the outcomes of 
the human-caused Schultz Fire, but they provide insight into the potential cost savings of proactive treatments for 
this particular example.

Conclusions 
• 
In 2013, the total cost of the Schultz Fire was conservatively estimated to be between $133 million and 
$147 million. This estimate included a loss in personal wealth due to reduced assessed property values in the 
amount of $59.4 million. We reassessed property values in the fire and flood footprint over time and found 
that average assessed property values in the study area had rebounded 51.5% from 2010 (Appendix A). Thus, 
we did not include property value changes in our updated full-cost accounting because the decrease docu-
mented in 2013 was likely driven by macro-level economic trends in the housing market rather than an effect 
of the fire and flooding (Table 21).
• 
By removing property values from the amount estimated in the original study (Combrink et al. 2013), the full 
costs in 2013 dollars would have been between $73.6 million and $87.6 million.  
• 
In the current study, the total cost of the Schultz Fire for the period 2010–2021 was conservatively estimat-
ed to be between $95.8 million and $100.7 million in 2021 dollars, including the fire response and post-fire 
flooding response and mitigation, but excluding all losses and gains related to assessed property values. This 
represents a 30%–15% increase in the respective range of costs from 2013, excluding the 2013 property values.
• 
The largest costs were incurred by government and utility entities in the amount of $73.4 million over ten 
years. Coconino County and the Forest Service bore the largest expenses (Table 3). At the same time, survey 
respondents indicated high support and satisfaction related to flood mitigation conducted by both Coconino 
County and Coconino National Forest, among other agencies. 
• 
The government and utility expenses were largely incurred between 2010 and 2015, which demonstrates that 
the pace of expenses decreases over time. Nonetheless, the most expensive mitigation projects for the post-fire 
flooding from the 2010 Schultz Fire were incurred in 2015.
• 
With additional ecological monitoring of MSO PACs since the original study (Combrink et al. 2013), we 
were able to determine that there was no MSO loss, but rather, displacement and a reduction in total MSO 
habitat—mixed-conifer forests within the fire footprint. As such, the economic valuation for MSO habitat 
loss was adjusted to reflect the costs associated with an overall reduction in MSO habitat due to the fire. 
• 
Surveyed households in 2020, a decade after the fire, indicated that they were still experiencing long-term 
well-being and mental health effects. Namely, 25% of respondents shared that the Schultz Fire and subse-
quent flooding has caused significant stress, while just under 20% agreed that their mental health has suffered 
because of fire or flooding events.
• 
Individual costs from the updated household survey were estimated to range between $4.6 million to $6.6 
million for insurance-related costs (i.e., insurance, claims, damages) and between $3.4 million to $5.3 million 
for prevention and mitigation measures (i.e., initial costs and upkeep), which represents a range of approx-
imately 8% to 12% of the post-fire flooding-related costs. There was also a decline in respondents who said 
they were purchasing flood insurance over time.
• 
The household survey responses aligned well with previous research in nearby communities affected by fire 
(i.e., the 2019 Museum Fire near Flagstaff) and highlighted a strong understanding of shared responsibility 
across members of the public (Edgeley and Colavito 2020).

Lessons Learned and Considerations for Wildfire Full-Cost Accounting
• 
Undertaking a wildfire full-cost accounting is complicated by the effects of macro-level events that compound 
local micro-economic events. For example, we determined that macro-economic effects from the Great Reces-
sion and housing crisis drove the estimates of personal wealth loss due to reduced assessed property values in 
the original study (Combrink et al. 2013) and were not driven by the fire and post-fire flooding. Nonetheless, 
macro-level events can put additional pressure on micro-level economic events, such as the 2010 Schultz Fire 
and flooding in 2010 to 2012. Macro-level events compound local trends and are difficult to tease apart from 
assessed housing values in the study area. 
• 
Full-cost accounting studies that include economic costs of non-market values like habitat will benefit from 
longer-term ecological data to inform overall trends and costs to ecosystem services like changes in suitability 
of habitat, and thus value, over time.
• 
Events like the 2010 Schultz Fire and post-fire flooding can have long-lasting effects that often go undoc-
umented. These include long-term financial costs, but also effects that are more difficult to quantify such as 
decreases in local ecosystem services and societal costs like community well-being. Long-term studies such as 
this one that provide a unique look at the ongoing costs of a major wildfire are important to understand the 
true scope and scale of the effects of uncharacteristic wildfire and post-fire flooding. Studies such as this can 
provide further justification for the importance of proactive forest restoration and fuel reduction treatments to 
reduce the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire to ecosystems and communities.

About the ERI White Paper Series: Issues in Forest Restoration 
Ecological restoration is a practice that seeks to heal degraded ecosystems by reestablishing native species, 
structural characteristics, and ecological processes. The Society for Ecological Restoration International defines 
ecological restoration as “an intentional activity that initiates or accelerates the recovery of an ecosystem with 
respect to its health, integrity and sustainability … Restoration attempts to return an ecosystem to its historic 
trajectory” (Society for Ecological Restoration International 2004).
Throughout the dry forests of the western United States, most ponderosa pine forests have been degraded 
during the last 150 years. Many ponderosa pine areas are now dominated by dense thickets of small trees, and 
lack their once-diverse understory of grasses, sedges, and forbs. Forests in this condition are highly susceptible to 
damaging, stand-replacing fires and increased insect and disease epidemics. Restoration of these forests centers 
on reintroducing frequent, low-intensity surface fires—often after thinning dense stands—and reestablishing 
productive understory plant communities.
The Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University is a pioneer in researching, implementing, 
and monitoring ecological restoration of dry, frequent-fire forests in the Intermountain West. By allowing natural 
processes, such as fire, to resume self-sustaining patterns, we hope to reestablish healthy forests that provide 
ecosystem services, wildlife habitat, and recreational opportunities.
The ERI Issues in Forest Restoration series provides overviews and policy recommendations derived from 
research and observations by the ERI and its partner organizations. While the ERI staff recognizes that every 
forest restoration is site specific, we feel that the information provided in the series may help decision-makers 
elsewhere.
