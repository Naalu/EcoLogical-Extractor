Mixtures of airborne lidar-based approaches improve
predictions of forest structure1
Ryan C. Blackburn, Robert Buscaglia, and Andrew J. Sánchez Meador
Abstract: The most common method for modeling forest attributes with airborne lidar, the area-based approach, involves
summarizing the point cloud of individual plots and relating this to attributes of interest. Tree- and voxel-based approaches
have been considered as alternatives to the area-based approach but are rarely considered in an area-based context. We esti-
mated three forest attributes (basal area, overstory biomass, and volume) across 1680 ﬁeld plots in Arizona and New Mexico.
Variables from the three lidar approaches (area, tree, and voxel) were created for each plot. Random forests were estimated
using subsets of variables based on each individual lidar approach and mixtures of each approach. Boruta feature selection
was performed on variable subsets, including the mixture of all lidar-approach predictors (KS-Boruta). A corrected paired
t test was utilized to compare six validated models (area-Boruta, tree-Boruta, voxel-Boruta, KS-Boruta, KS-all, and ridge-all)
for each forest attribute. Based on signiﬁcant reductions in error (SMdAPE), basal area and biomass were best modeled with
KS-Boruta, while volume was best modeled with KS-all. Analysis of variable importance shows that voxel-based predictors
are critical for the prediction of the three forest attributes. This study highlights the importance of multiresolution voxel-
based variables for modeling forest attributes in an area-based context.
Key words: voxel, individual-tree detection, area-based approach, random forest, Boruta.
Résumé : La méthode la plus courante pour modéliser les attributs de la forêt avec le lidar aéroporté, l’approche par zone,
consiste à résumer le nuage de points des parcelles individuelles et à le relier aux attributs d’intérêt. Les approches basées
sur les arbres et sur les voxels ont été considérées comme des solutions de rechange à l’approche basée sur la zone, mais
elles sont rarement considérées dans un contexte basé sur la zone. Nous avons estimé trois attributs de la forêt (la surface
terrière, la biomasse de l’étage supérieur et le volume) sur 1680 parcelles de terrain en Arizona et au Nouveau-Mexique.
Pour chaque parcelle, ces variables ont été calculées selon trois approches lidar (par zone, par arbre et par voxel). Des forêts
d’arbres décisionnels ont été estimées à l’aide de sous-ensembles de variables basés sur chaque approche lidar prise individu-
ellement et à l’aide d’assemblages de ces approches. Une sélection des caractéristiques a été effectuée sur des sous-ensembles
des variables à l’aide d’un algorithme de Boruta, y compris un assemblage de tous les prédicteurs de l’approche lidar (KS-Boruta).
Un test de t apparié corrigé a été utilisé pour comparer six modèles validés (Boruta par zone, Boruta par arbre, Boruta par voxel,
KS-Boruta, KS-toutes les méthodes, régression ridge-toutes les méthodes) pour chaque attribut de la forêt. Sur la base de la réduc-
tion signiﬁcative de l’erreur, la surface terrière et la biomasse étaient mieux modélisées avec le KS-Boruta tandis que le volume
était mieux modélisé avec le KS- outes les méthodes. L’analyse de l’importance des variables montre que les prédicteurs basés sur
les voxels sont essentiels pour la prédiction des trois attributs de la forêt. Cette étude met en évidence l’importance des varia-
bles basées sur le voxel multi-résolution pour la modélisation des attributs de la forêt dans une approche basée sur la zone.

Introduction
Forests in the western United States (US) currently face increas-
ing threats of landscape-scale disturbances such as wildﬁres,
extreme drought, and bark beetle outbreaks largely attributed to a
warming climate (Breshears et al. 2005; Westerling 2006; Hicke
et al. 2016). A large portion of these forests also exist in novel,
uncharacteristic, conditions created from anthropogenic activities
(e.g., unregulated livestock grazing, landscape-scale intensive log-
ging, ﬁre suppression) that drastically altered forest structure and
composition, exacerbating the impacts of these disturbances
(Cannon et al. 2018). For example, forests in the southwestern US
have shifted to more homogenous, dense canopies that favor
ﬁre-intolerant and shade-tolerant species (Rodman et al. 2016). To
address this, ecological restoration has been proposed across mil-
lions of hectares with the goal of shifting the forest structure and
composition closer to its historical range of variability (HRV)
(Landres et al. 1999; Huffman et al. 2017). HRV serves as a target
for western frequent-ﬁre forests that will most likely create more

resilient and self-sustaining forest conditions able to withstand
the increasing threats of climate-driven, landscape-scale distur-
bances (Allen et al. 2002; Reynolds et al. 2013).
It is common that a variety of forest structural and composi-
tional characteristics be used to describe and quantify forest con-
ditions. Characteristics used for describing forest conditions may
include measures such as tree density, basal area, canopy cover,
aboveground biomass (AGB), species composition, and herba-
ceous understory biomass and composition (Laughlin et al. 2006;
Huffman et al. 2017; Tenneson et al. 2018). Alternative manage-
ment goals and outcomes (e.g., improved wildlife habitat vs.
increased timber production) are often evaluated using these
characteristics, making the need for accurate estimates even
more important (Ganey et al. 2017). These characteristics are pri-
marily measured in small plots (i.e., a few to 100s of square
metres), which are then extrapolated to landscape-level measure-
ments (Holl 2017); however, 25.5% (or 75 290 km2) of Arizona
alone is forested (Shaw et al. 2018), and achieving a scale relevant
to landscape forest restoration with only ﬁeld inventory data is
often impractical.
Remote sensing data provides the opportunity to quantify for-
est conditions more accurately across various scales. Speciﬁcally,
airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) data have become
more widely available and commonly used for assessing forest
conditions. As a form of active remote sensing, lidar sensors send
pulses to the ground and measure each return to create a three-
dimensional (3D) point cloud (Maltamo 2014). In addition to 3D
locational information, lidar can also provide a measure of the
energy returned from each pulse, known as intensity (White
et al. 2016). Lidar data provide direct measurements across the
entire area of interest, which can be used in conjunction with ﬁeld
inventory data resulting in a more accurate and cost-effective
method for obtaining forest metrics from the landscapes to ﬁne-
scale regions (Latiﬁet al. 2015; White et al. 2016; Jeronimo et al.
2018). The most common form of lidar analysis to obtain forest
structural characteristics, the area-based approach, quantiﬁes
the returns across a grid of pixels in which each pixel represents
a given area (Næsset 2002; White et al. 2016). The pixel values
describe a summary (e.g., average) of point cloud distributions
within a given area that are then used to model forest structure and
resources. There are, however, additional lidar-based approaches
that may provide more accurate estimations of forest structure.
Often contrasted with the area-based approach, individual-tree
detection (ITD) or segmentation algorithms have been developed
to delineate individual trees and produce single tree characteristics
(e.g., tree crown area, height, canopy volume, biomass) across entire
lidar acquisitions (Latiﬁet al. 2015; Wang et al. 2016; Silva et al. 2016;
Dalponte and Coomes 2016; Jeronimo et al. 2018); however, ITD algo-
rithms always occur with omission and commission errors varying
by tree size (Vastaranta et al. 2012). These errors can also change
across forest types, structures, and data sets (Jeronimo et al. 2018;
Wiggins et al. 2019). Recent research has sought to improve ITD
methodologies and highlight applications in which it is most useful
(Vastaranta et al. 2012; Jeronimo et al. 2018; Wiggins et al. 2019). One
potential use for ITD involves summarizing ITD-derived tree charac-
teristics over a given area similarly to the area-based approach
(hereafter referred to as the tree-based approach).
Volumetric pixel, or “voxel”, based descriptions of the point
cloud provide similar distributional summary statistics to those
produced using area-based approaches and have been increasing
in notoriety (Pearse et al. 2019; Goodbody et al. 2020). Although
voxels were originally designed for ground-based lidar data,
Pearse et al. (2019) recently showed how plot-level voxel summa-
ries can improve predictive performance when modeling impor-
tant forest characteristics such as volume and basal area. Pearse
et al. (2019) hypothesized that voxels may provide additional de-
scriptive representation of horizontal structure within the point
cloud, while area-based summaries are expected to already account
for most of the vertical structure. Additionally, multiple voxel reso-
lutions can provide nested scales of information within an area,
potentially increasing voxel-based model accuracy (Pearse et al.
2019; Goodbody et al. 2020). Research is needed across a range of
forest types to fully understand the beneﬁts of using the voxel-
based approach.
The large quantity of lidar-derived variables available and their in-
herent correlations make selecting the correct modeling approaches
imperative. In forestry, lidar is most commonly used to estimate for-
est attributes with the goal of increasing prediction accuracy with-
out being too concerned about interpretability (White et al. 2016).
Models providing high interpretability such as parametric
approaches are more restrictive, which results in lower predic-
tion accuracies (James et al. 2013). Despite this, parametric
methods are still the most common among remote sensing
data users (Yu et al. 2014; Maxwell et al. 2018). Machine learning
techniques are less interpretable but generally have been shown
to ﬁnd stronger relationships between remote sensing and ﬁeld data
in comparison with traditional parametric techniques (Yu et al.
2014). Machine learning techniques are not constrained to the same
assumptions as in parametric approaches, allowing machine learn-
ing techniques to be used in situations of high dimensionality and
(or) highly correlated predictor variables (James et al. 2013; Maxwell
et al. 2018). Reduction of dimensionality has been shown to increase
prediction accuracy in some cases, which can be done using various
feature selection techniques (Maxwell et al. 2018); however, improve-
ments in accuracy are not guaranteed, and feature selection can
occasionally reduce model accuracies. As a result, the best way to
ensure the development of the most accurate model is to compare
both full and reduced datasets (Maxwell et al. 2018). Due to reasons
stated above, studies should investigate models with different
interpretability (i.e., parametric vs. machine learning) and reduced
vs. full features sets when using lidar-derived data.
This study aims to determine the most accurate lidar-based
approach, or combination of approaches, when modeling impor-
tant forest attributes, including basal area, aboveground biomass
(AGB), and volume at the landscape scales. We (1) compare each
approach (area, tree, and voxel based) by assessing prediction
errors for basal area, AGB, and volume; (2) quantitatively assess
how well a mixture of variables created from the three approaches
compare with using a single approach; and (3) identify variables
that are driving the most accurate predictions of each response. In
doing so, we provide a framework for comparing new statistical
and remote sensing techniques, as well as an approach to obtaining
more accurate forest attribute predictions important for monitor-
ing during this era of large-scale forest management.
Materials and methods
Study area
This study took place in ﬁve national forests within northern Ari-
zona and New Mexico (Fig. 1). This area was selected to capitalize on
available ﬁeld data and lidar acquisitions that were collected for
speciﬁc forest health and restoration projects. These include the
Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI) within the Coconino, Tonto,
and Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests (7911 km2), the Kaibab For-
est Health Focus project within the Kaibab National Forest and
Grand Canyon National Park (1853 km2), and the Southwest Jemez
Mountain Landscape Restoration Project (SWJM) within the Santa
Fe National Forest (526 km2) (Tenneson et al. 2018). The combined
area of these projects (10 290 km2) encompasses a wide range of for-
est conditions (Table 1) creating the opportunity to develop a re-
gional understanding of lidar-derived forest structure accuracies in
the southwestern US.
The study area covered a variety of frequent-ﬁre pine and
mixed conifer forest community types largely due to variations
in elevation and moisture availability. This area ranges from 1700
to 3100 m above sea level and experiences a bimodal precipitation

August (Tenneson et al. 2018). Overstory communities consist of a
variety of species including conifers (blue spruce (Picea pungens
Engelm.), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.),
corkbark ﬁr (Abies lasiocarpa var. arizonica (Merriam) Lemmon),
subalpine ﬁr (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.), white ﬁr (Abies concolor
(Gordon & Glend.) Lindl. ex Hildebr.), limber pine (Pinus ﬂexilis
E. James), southwestern white pine (Pinus strobiformis Engelm.),
Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex P. Lawson & C. Lawson), two-needle
pinyon (Pinus edulis Engelm.), and Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma
(Torr.) Little)) and hardwoods (bigtooth maple (Acer grandidentatum
Nutt.), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), New Mexico locust
(Robinia neomexicana A. Gray), and Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.)).

et al. (2018).
Data collection
Field data were collected at over 3000 circular plots by the US
Forest Service (USFS) and the Ecological Restoration Institute
between 2013 and 2015. We then separated the data into subsets
to ensure that all plots were 0.04 ha in size. This provided a total
of 1680 plots, including 1504, 116, and 60 within the 4FRI, North
Kaibab Plateau, and Southwest Jemez Mountain Landscape
Restoration Project study areas, respectively. Plot locations
were recorded with submeter locational accuracy using either a
Trimble GeoXH6000 with GPS + GLONASS or a Trimble GeoXH
with GPS (Tenneson et al. 2018). Within each plot, all trees with
a diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than 12.7 cm (except
North Kaibab Plateau, where DBH > 20.3 cm) had DBH and spe-
cies recorded (Tenneson et al. 2018). Some sites also included
information on tree height and height to live crown, but this was
not used in the analysis. AGB, volume, and basal area were mod-
eled using tree-level species-speciﬁc allometric equations within
the Central Rockies variant of the Forest Vegetation Simulator
(FVS) (Crookston and Dixon 2005; Dixon 2020; Keyser 2020).
Because FVS provides estimates per acre, we then converted
those estimates to metric units (i.e., m2, m3, kg) per plot (0.04 ha),
which allows our models to predict forest characteristics at a
400 m2 spatial resolution.
Lidar data were acquired across four acquisitions between 2012
and 2014 with various Leica ALS series sensors (Table 1; additional
details in Tenneson et al. 2018). The acquisitions were ﬂown dur-
ing leaf-on conditions (i.e., June to September). Average pulse
densities were ≥8 pulses·m–2, and vertical accuracies were within
15 cm for each acquisition. As a result, each acquisition falls
within the US Geological Survey deﬁned quality level one (QL1)
for lidar data (Heidemann 2012).

Lidar-derived variable creation
Using the lidR (Roussel et al. 2020) and sf (Pebesma 2018) pack-
ages in R, we clipped the lidar data to each plot and normalized the
point cloud to heights above ground. Predictor variables from each
type of lidar approach (Fig. 2) were then calculated for each plot
using custom functions (https://github.com/RCBlackburn/lidRmts)
and the lidR package (Supplementary Table S12). This resulted in
three predictor sets based on each lidar approach. The area-based
variables were created to emulate the same characteristics commonly
used to predict forest attributes found in FUSION (McGaughey 2009).
The variables (n = 119) summarize aspects of point density, return
numbers, height, and intensity across the plot. All area-based
variables were calculated using points greater than or equal to
1.37 m in height.
Tree-based variables were calculated using the same point clouds
as for the area-based approach. The watershed ITD algorithm
within lidR was used to segment individual trees on each plot. To
run the watershed algorithm, a 0.25 m2 pit-free canopy height
model (CHM) was created. Based on an inverted topographic relief
of the CHM, trees with a minimum height of 1.37 m were then iden-
tiﬁed (Pau et al. 2010).Variables (n = 37) of segmented tree densities,
tree heights, and crown areas were calculated within the plot (Sup-
plementary Table S12).
Voxel-based variables were calculated using the same point
clouds as above, but without the 1.37 m speciﬁed height cutoff.
Ground points were removed before voxel-based variables were
calculated. Using the voxel_metrics() function in lidR, each plot
was partitioned into a voxelized 3D object and empty voxels
were added. A variety of voxel-based variables have been used
with airborne lidar data in previous studies and can be calcu-
lated based on within, above, or below voxel characteristics (Kim
et al. 2016; Pearse et al. 2019). For each voxel, a variety of varia-
bles were calculated based on height, point density, and inten-
sity. These variables were then summarized to the plot-level to
provide one observation per plot for each voxel variable (Supple-
mentary Table S12). This was done at ﬁve spatial resolutions (1, 2,
3, 4, and 5 m3) resulting in 940 voxel-based plot-level variables.
In total, 1096 predictor variables were created between the three
approaches.
Analysis
Four sets of predictor variables were created including area-based,
tree-based, and voxel-based variables and a mixture of all variables
(hereafter referred to as “kitchen sink” or KS). We performed feature
selection for each set using the Boruta algorithm from the R package
Boruta (Kursa and Rudnicki 2010) with a total of 1000 trees per ran-
dom forest. Boruta has been found to be especially effective in high-
dimensional settings and with remote sensing data such as in our
study (Degenhardt et al. 2019; Arjasakusuma et al. 2020). Boruta is a
machine learning wrapper that introduces shadow variables into the
predictor variable set. Boruta shufﬂes the original values for each pre-
dictor, creating new variables (i.e., shadow variables) that have a ran-
dom relationship with the response. Z scores are then used to
compare the variable importance of the shadow variables and the
lidar-derived predictor variables (Fig. 3) (Kursa and Rudnicki 2010).
Variable importance is calculated for each regression tree within a
random forest by taking the difference of the mean squared error
(MSE) between a regression tree and an alternative regression tree in
which the variable of interest is randomly shufﬂed (i.e., permuted).
The average of this difference is then taken for all regression trees
within the random forest, and variables with larger values (i.e., larger
reductions in MSE) represent more important variables (Kursa and
Rudnicki 2010; Wright and Ziegler 2017). For each set, predictors were
retained in the random forest model when their variable importance
was signiﬁcantly improved (i.e., p ≤0.01) over the shadow features.
Random forests were estimated for each response with the four
Boruta-reduced predictor sets and an additional random forest
with the KS predictor set. All random forests were created using
the R package ranger and estimated with 1000 trees per random
forest (Wright and Ziegler 2017). Variable importance was reported
for each random forest model, and we calculated the mean and
standard deviation of the variable importance for ﬁnal predictor
variables falling in the top 95th and 99th percentiles. To provide a
parametric comparison, we also included a penalized regression
model using the KS predictor set. Ridge regression allows for coefﬁ-
cient estimation during conditions of highly correlated predictor
variables using a penalization parameter (l ). The parameter l
shrinks coefﬁcient magnitudes and should be selected through
cross-validation prior to estimation of the ridge model (Friedman
et al. 2010). In this study, we built a ridge regression model in
R using the package glmnet with the KS-predictor set, and the mag-
nitude of l was established prior to ﬁnal model estimation using
cross-validation (Friedman et al. 2010). This resulted in the follow-
ing six models available for comparisons: (1) area-Boruta, (2) tree-
Boruta, (3) voxel-Boruta, (4) KS-Boruta, (5) KS-all, and (6) ridge-all. In
each case, “-Boruta” refers to the Boruta selected variable set and
“-all” refers to all variables prior to Boruta feature selection.
We assessed model performance using 10 repeats of 10-fold
cross-validation based on symmetric median absolute percentage
error (SMdAPE; eq. 1) and normalized root mean squared error
(NRMSE; eq. 2) as a percentage of the mean. The SMdAPE provides
a robust, less biased measure of scaled error comparable across
different responses and data sets (Hyndman and Koehler 2006;
Tofallis 2015; Chung et al. 2019). NRMSE was included for compar-
ison due to its conventional use in the ﬁeld; however, NRMSE is
sensitive to large magnitudes of error and can be normalized in a
variety of ways that makes cross study or statistical comparisons
less reliable, which is why we based our results on the more sta-
ble SMdAPE (Armstrong and Collopy 1992; Hyndman and Koehler
2006). By signiﬁcantly reducing the test set SMdAPE, models are
selected with an error rate representative of the variation observed
within the study area. Final models were chosen based on signiﬁ-
cant reductions (i.e., p ≤0.05) in SMdAPE using a corrected t value
for repeated k-fold cross-validation (Bouckaert and Frank 2004;
eq. 3). To account for multiple comparisons, p values were adjusted
using false discovery rate (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995). If models
were not signiﬁcantly different, the model with the lowest mean
SMdAPE (mSMdAPE) was chosen. The same repeated k-fold cross-
validated t test was conducted with the NRMSE values to contrast
with SMdAPE.

Results
Boruta feature selection resulted in reduced predictor sets for
models containing voxel-based variables for basal area, volume,
and AGB. In contrast, Boruta selected all 119 variables for the
three area-Boruta models and only removed one variable when
predicting basal area for the tree-Boruta models. Voxel-Boruta
models were reduced from 940 to 170, 177, and 180 predictors for
basal area, volume, and AGB, respectively. KS-Boruta for each
response retained features largely favoring voxel-based variables,
including a mixture of voxel resolutions (Table 2). Voxel-based
variables included a wide range of measures for both intensity
and height distributions. Due to the large amount of potential
voxel variables to report on, we only focus on voxel-based variables
for the ﬁnal models through variable importance. When modeling
basal area, KS-Boruta was reduced to 159 voxel-based, 6 area-based,
and 9 tree-based variables. Area-based variables included four meas-
ures of intensity (m_i, total_i, cv_i, and entropy_1) and two measures
of height (npoints and z_decile_cumulative_5). Tree-based variables
were all a measure of the distributions of segmented crown areas
within the plot. When modeling volume, KS-Boruta was reduced to
158 voxel-based,17 area-based, and 7 tree-based variables. Area-based
variables mostly measured distributions of height such as quantiles
and deciles; however, total_i was also included. Fewer tree-based varia-
bles were retained in comparison with basal area, but each tree-based
variable was still a measure of segmented tree crown distributions.
When modeling AGB, KS-Boruta was reduced to 180 voxel-based, 10
area-based, and 9 tree-based variables. AGB included many of the
same area- and tree-based variables that were retained in KS-
Boruta for volume; however, AGB also included the tree-based pre-
dictor segmented quadratic mean crown area (qm_tree_crown_area)
and the skew of point heights within the plot (skew_z).
Final models were chosen on signiﬁcant reductions in the cross-
validated test set SMdAPE (Fig. 4). Voxel-Boruta outperformed area-
Boruta for basal area (p = 1.69  1012), volume (p = 4.57  1012), and
AGB (p = 2.07  1011). Voxel-Boruta also signiﬁcantly outperformed
tree-Boruta (Supplementary Table S22). Although voxel-Boruta and
KS-Boruta are not signiﬁcantly different, KS-Boruta consistently
had a lower mSMdAPE for each response (Table 3). KS-all and KS-
Boruta do not have signiﬁcantly different performances, although
KS-Boruta typically returned the lower mSMdAPE. Volume was
the only response in which KS-all had a lower mSMdAPE than KS-
Boruta; however, the mSMdAPE difference between KS-all and
KS-Boruta for volume was less than 0.1%. Though we consider KS-
all to be our ﬁnal model for volume based on selection criteria
(lowest mSMdAPE), KS-Boruta may be the more practical choice
given the reduced number of variables that need to be computed.
NRMSE provided the same resulting ﬁnal models except for vol-
ume, where KS-Boruta had the lowest mean NRMSE (mNRMSE).
Signiﬁcant differences in NRMSE correlate with SMdAPE results
(Fig. 4); however, basal area showed a signiﬁcant difference of KS-
Boruta from voxel-Boruta and ridge-all, which was not found
with SMdAPE (Supplementary Table S42). NRMSE also provided a
signiﬁcant difference between KS-Boruta and voxel-Boruta for
AGB. These minor differences between SMdAPE and NRMSE arise
because of the larger variance inherent to NRMSE.This variance is a
component of the repeated-fold corrected t test (eq. 3) and is directly
observed by higher standard deviations, presented in Table 3.
The summaries of model performance for both SMdAPE and
NRMSE indicate that the KS-Boruta modeling strategy optimizes
predictive models for basal area, volume, and AGB. This includes
a signiﬁcant reduction in mSMdAPE and mNRMSE over area- and
tree-based predictor sets, along with the reduction of features in

comparison with KS-all. KS-Boruta reduced mSMdAPE to 20.1%,
20.8%, and 21.3% and mNRMSE to 33.3%, 34.6%, and 34.2% for
basal area, volume, and ABG, respectively. KS-Boruta resulted in
a reduction of at least 5% in mSMdAPE and mNRMSE in compa-
rison with area-Boruta and tree-Boruta across all responses. As
a result, the KS-Boruta modeling is an optimal strategy for
predicting basal area, volume, and AGB and should be explored
when modeling other forest attributes.
Mean variable importance from the cross-validated random
forests provide insight into the amount of error reduction that
occurred on average when including a given variable in our ﬁnal
models. The predictors within the top 95th percentile of variable

at the plot level; and (c) voxel-based approach divides the plot into three-dimensional cubes (i.e., voxels) at varying resolutions. The

importance for basal area and AGB and the top 99th percentile
for volume are made up of six voxel-based measurements with
varying resolutions (1, 2, 3, and 4 m3) and measures of distribu-
tion (Table 4). The 99th percentile was used for the ﬁnal model
(KS-all) of volume due to the large number of variables (i.e., 1096).
The frequency ratio of the number of returns above a voxel in
relation of the total returns (FR_Di), the number of returns below
a voxel (P_Di), and descriptions of height within a voxel (z_SVi) at
varying resolutions and summaries of distributions appear as the
top predictors for all three responses. P_Di at 1 m3 summarized
by the coefﬁcient of variation improved the accuracy the most
for basal area and AGB, while the mean FR_Di at 2 m3 improved ac-
curacy the most for volume. Unique variables were also selected
within the ﬁnal models for each response. Canopy closure above
21 m (cc_above_21) measured at 3 m3 resolution only appeared in
the 95th percentile of variable importance for basal area. The effec-
tive number of layers measured through the second Hill number
(ENL_2D) at 2 m3 resolution was also unique to AGB. Volume had
two unique variables that used the interquartile range to summa-
rize FR_Di, while all other summary statistics of dispersion were
measured by the coefﬁcient of variation. Voxel resolutions were
mostly consistent between responses, though variables with the
3 m3 dimensions were most common in basal area. Additionally,
voxel-based variables with 4 m3 dimensions were present for two
variables for volume and one variable for AGB. The occurrence of
only voxel-based variables in top percentile importance for each
response provides even further evidence to support the use of
voxels.
Discussion
With forested landscapes experiencing changes at a rate and
scale never seen before, accurate large-scale quantiﬁcation of forest
conditions has never been more important.This study provides fur-
ther evidence for the use of lidar, speciﬁcally with the voxel-based
approach, to predict basal area, volume, and AGB with machine
learning implementations of feature selection and modeling in for-
est restoration. Based on our three study objectives, we found that
(1) the voxel-based approach provides statistically signiﬁcant reduc-
tions in predictions errors in comparison with the tree- and area-
based approaches; (2) a mixture of all three lidar approaches
further reduced errors for each response; and (3) a range of differ-
ent voxel-based predictors at varying resolutions regularly provide
reductions in error for basal area, volume, and AGB.The mixture of
lidar-based approaches (i.e., KS-Boruta, KS-all) provides errors that
facilitate an accurate assessment of forest structure at scales
needed for sustainable forest management and restoration. Future
assessments of new remote sensing and statistical techniques can
use the feature selection and repeated k-fold pairwise comparisons
of model errors presented in this study as a framework for deter-
mining the appropriate methodologies to use moving forward.
Forest attributes have commonly been modeled with lidar data
using either the area- or tree-based approach that provides esti-
mates of error that further support the use of voxels for error
reduction. Tenneson et al. (2018) used the area-based approach
along with environmental variables (e.g., normalized difference
vegetation index, ecosystem type) in a combination of stepwise
regression and Bayesian model averaging to predict AGB per hec-
tare. Tenneson et al. (2018) achieved a normalized root mean
squared error (NRMSE) of 32.7% with a larger set of the same data
in this study, but they did not explore their modeling technique’s
ability to predict basal area or volume. The NRMSE for the AGB
KS-Boruta model was close to the NRMSE found in Tenneson
et al. (2018). The more comparable predictor set, area-Boruta, had
a NMRSE almost 10% higher than that found in Tenneson et al.
(2018); however, the use of additional data sources may have con-
tributed to better predictions and these were not used in our
study to allow for comparisons across lidar-speciﬁc approaches.
Area-Boruta was also in line with other studies predicting basal
area and volume. Within North American conifer forests, basal
area NRMSEs ranged from 32.3% to 50.1% (Woods et al. 2008;
Fekety et al. 2018) compared with area-Boruta with a 39.4%
NMRSE. Volume predictions with the area-based approach have
resulted in NMRSEs of 34% (Woods et al. 2008) and 37.3%
(Lindberg and Hollaus 2012). Though these error rates are lower
than the area-Boruta model for volume (42.6%), these studies
used different scales of analysis and took place in different
regions.
Tree-based approaches provide insights into tree- and plot-level
forest attributes, but the accuracy of tree-based approaches vary
greatly depending on how and where they are implemented. For
example, Yu et al. (2010) achieved a NRMSE of 15.4% when modeling
volume at the plot level; however, when not manually matching
segmented trees (such as done in our study), the NRMSE was found
to be 56.5% (Yu et al. 2010). Tree-based approaches are also com-
monly used for predicting AGB and have NRMSE ranging from 14%
to 32% (Bortolot and Wynne 2005; Gleason and Im 2012; Kankare
et al. 2013; Popescu and Hauglin 2014). These studies cover a range
of forest types and management practices. The lower errors are
found in homogenous conditions (e.g., pine plantations), which
would likely result in more accurate predictions (Bortolot and
Wynne 2005; Kankare et al. 2013). Basal area has also been modeled
with some accuracy with tree-based approaches, but percent errors
were not reported (Chen et al. 2007). Tree-Boruta falls within the
wide range of error rates for forest attributes, but tree-based mod-
els are hard to compare given the variety of methods to implement
tree-based approaches.
Only a few studies have implemented a voxel-based approach
with airborne lidar. Kim et al. (2016) introduced a variety of voxel-
based variables for modeling AGB and achieved a NRMSE of
24.9% within a deciduous tropical forest. The variables from Kim
et al. (2016) and additional voxel-based variables were then used
in Australian pine plantations by Pearse et al. (2019) when model-
ing basal area and volume with NRMSEs of 19.6% and 18.8%,
respectively. Goodbody et al. (2020) expanded the concept of voxels
with the use of multispectral lidar and multiple voxel resolutions
within a diverse conifer forest in Ontario, Canada. Goodbody et al.
(2020) achieved NMRSEs of 12.7% and 20.4% for basal area and vol-
ume, respectively. Similarly, our results provide evidence to support
the use of voxel-based predictors described at multiple resolutions.
Though our error rates appeared higher than those in previous
studies, our lidar data predict across multiple forest types and con-
ditions within the southwestern US and do not contain multispec-
tral information.
Boruta feature selection and mean variable importance allowed
us to determine what variables were most important for predicting
forest characteristics. Voxel-based variables were consistently the
most selected and important in our KS-Boruta models. Pearse et al.
(2019) also looked at importance values and found that voxel-based
variables were most important when predicting volume and basal
area; however, our most important voxel-based variables differ
between Pearse et al. (2019) apart from canopy closure when

modeling basal area.This may be a result of including different forms
of summary statistics. For example, we found that the summary sta-
tistic for measures of dispersion that occurred most frequently was
the coefﬁcient of variation. Important voxel-based predictors such
as the coefﬁcient of variation of the frequency ratio (cv_FR_Di)
may provide more ﬁne-scale measures of three-dimensional heter-
ogeneity as opposed to the area-based approach. Area- and tree-
based predictors were still included in the KS-Boruta models and
provided additional information to help reduce the prediction
error. Basal area, volume, and AGB all had different predictors
from these approaches. Segmented tree crown summaries were
most important for basal area, which may be a result of the known
relationship between crown and stem diameter (Hemery et al.
2005). On the other hand, area-based predictors are important for
describing vertical heterogeneity, which can be closely tied to vol-
ume and AGB (Pearse et al. 2019). Regardless of the importance of
the area- and tree-based approaches, voxel-based predictors have a
stronger relationship with basal area, volume, and AGB.
Another unique feature of the voxel-based approach in this study
was the distribution of multiple voxel resolutions selected for each
response. All voxel resolutions were selected for various voxel-
based variables in the KS-Boruta models. Uncertainties in the

importance of different voxel resolutions are apparent in the litera-
ture (Pearse et al. 2019; Goodbody et al. 2020). We hypothesize that
the occurrence of multiple resolutions selected by Boruta is a result
of the way in which structural components of the canopy are being
detected within a voxel at various scales. We did identify a slight
trend showing each response favoring voxel resolution between 2
and 4 m3. This may suggest that the 1 m3 and 5 m3 resolutions are
beginning to hit the limits of resolutions that do not provide useful
structural information for basal area, volume, and AGB. The build-
ing evidence from Goodbody et al. (2020) and the work presented
here support the mixture of voxel resolutions, and we suggest that
future research should look at a wider range of voxel resolutions
for different forest attributes.
One limitation to the voxel-based approach is the computa-
tional power required to compute these variables at the land-
scape scale. Many of our voxel-based variables are created at the
individual voxel level and then are summarized across all voxels
within a plot. This is then repeated at multiple resolutions.
Though larger resolutions are processed more quickly because
less voxels are in a plot, we did not directly compare voxel resolu-
tions to advocate the use of one resolution over another. Despite
computational limitation, the improvement in model performance
with the inclusion of voxel-based variables and their potential for
discovering unknown relationships between forest structure and
attributes important for restoration and management (e.g., wildlife
habitat, fuel distributions) cannot be ignored.
Further work should be done by expanding the use of all three
approaches to a variety of forest characteristics. For example, dif-
ferent voxel-based variables have been found to be important
indicators of understory communities and canopy leaf area den-
sity, which both play a role in wildlife habitat and ecological res-
toration (Kamoske et al. 2019; Venier et al. 2019). Additionally,
area-based variables are comparable with voxels in which subcanopy
information is not as important in characteristics such as height
(Pearse et al. 2019). An area-based approach moving towards a voxel-
based approach provided improvements when modeling volume,
basal area, and tree density by dividing the plot horizontally into
0.5 m2 pixels (Lindberg and Hollaus 2012). Our tree-based approach
used plot-level estimates of tree characteristics to predict the forest
attributes of interest. Certain variables such as summary statistics of
crown area appeared in all KS-Boruta models, which helped reduce
the mSMdAPE. However, additional tree-based approaches may be
more useful to compare with our voxel estimates. For example, ITD
segmented trees can provide individual values for a given forest
attribute such as AGB (Krofcheck et al. 2016). Additionally, ITD can
complement area-based approaches by providing area-based
descriptions of segmented trees and crowns (Bortolot and Wynne
2005; Gleason and Im 2012; Kankare et al. 2013; Jeronimo et al.
2018). Jeronimo et al. (2018) used ITD to ﬁnd the proportion of can-
opy height classes to better describe wildlife habitat. Overall, each
approach has unique applications answering different questions
that should all be considered prior to analysis.
As the lidar approaches presented in this paper continually de-
velop and new methodologies arise, the model selection and com-
parison framework outlined in this study can be used to continually
test their ability in modeling forest conditions. We have shown that
Boruta feature selection and corrected pairwise comparisons for
repeated k-fold cross-validation are effective tools for assessing
remote sensing techniques and optimizing model performance for
any forest attribute of interest. For example, other variables such as
the normalized difference vegetation index and ecosystem type var-
iables used in Tenneson et al. (2018) could be included in the KS-
Boruta model to determine their performance against the lidar-
derived variables. Additionally, the wide range of ITD segmentation
algorithms and tuning parameters could be compared using this
same selection and comparison framework. The Boruta algorithm
allows for variable selection even when the amount of predictors in
the model is greater than the sample size, which is common in
remote sensing (Kursa and Rudnicki 2010; James et al. 2013; Yu et al.
2019). However, other selection methods (e.g., stepwise regression,
criterions based on Bayes method, least absolute shrinkage, and
selection operator) should still be explored and compared using cor-
rected pairwise comparison tests. By continually testing and com-
paring new remote sensing techniques and modeling approaches,
remote sensing data can provide the most accurate landscape-scale
assessments for forest management and restoration.
Conclusions
This study outlines a feature selection and modeling strategy using
a heterogenous mixture of predictors signiﬁcantly improving basal
area, volume, and AGB predictions. By introducing multiresolution
voxel-based variables, we have shown signiﬁcant improvements in
crucial forest attributes that are used as criteria for ecological restora-
tion and wildlife management goals. The ﬁnal models presented
here can be used to predict these forest attributes across pine and

mixed conifer forests in the southwestern US at landscape scales.Tra-
ditionally, acceptable error rates for forest inventories are 20% with a
66% conﬁdence level (Hummel et al. 2011). Models based on remote
sensing data remove the need for a 66% conﬁdence level by providing
wall-to-wall coverage.The error rates for basal area, volume, and AGB
presented in this study are more consistent and fall within the ac-
ceptable error rates for quantifying forest inventories across a variety
of conditions and cover an area greater than one million hectares.
Accurate predictions of basal area, volume, and AGB can be used
across a diverse range of management and restoration assessments.
Landscape-scale assessments of AGB can be used for quantifying
wood availability for bio-energy markets or the amount of carbon
storage for climate modeling. Basal area distributions, commonly
used as indicators of restoration success (Reynolds et al. 2013), can
provide a measure of reaching restoration targets. Stand-level pre-
dictions of volume can identify regions of interest for harvesting
and provide reassurance to the managers selling timber. Overall,
the framework and models presented here can be used for devel-
oping new statistical and remote sensing methodologies, as well
as creating wall-to-wall assessments of basal area, volume, and
AGB within the southwestern US.
