ABSTRACT 
 
EFFECTS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF SEEDING FOLLOWING  
HIGH-SEVERITY WILDFIRES IN 
ARIZONA PONDEROSA PINE FORESTS 
KENNETH A. STELLA 
Seeding following high-severity wildfires is intended to reduce water runoff, soil erosion, 
and non-native species invasions.  Post-wildfire seeding treatments most commonly use 
seed of non-native annual cereal grains selected for quick growth and abundant root 
systems.  U.S. policy recommends the use of native seed, but adequate supplies of locally 
collected seed are rarely available.  Seeding following wildfires for erosion control is 
based on the positive correlation between bare ground and increased sedimentation rates, 
and the negative correlation between vegetative (or ground) cover and runoff and erosion 
rates.  Seeding to prevent non-native species invasions is based on the concept that 
seeded species will quickly co-opt resources and exclude non-natives.  Critics of seeding 
following wildfires argue that seeding rarely achieves the cover levels needed to 
effectively reduce runoff and erosion; when treatments do achieve high levels of cover, it 
comes at the expense of native plant regeneration.  Due to the stochastic nature of 
wildfires, well-replicated studies with adequate control areas have been rare.  I used a 
controlled, replicated, and randomized experimental design to test the effects and 
effectiveness of native and non-native seeding following three high-severity wildfires in 
Arizona ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa C. Laws.) forests.  I found seeding with either 
non-natives or native species: (1) was generally ineffective in producing the levels of 
vegetative cover associated with reduced runoff and erosion; (2) significantly altered 

3 
 
plant community composition; and (3) did not reduce abundance of non-native species.  
My results add to the growing evidence that seeding following high-severity wildfires 
does not achieve management objectives of providing high vegetative cover associated 
with low soil loss and suppression of non-native species.  Seeding also altered post-fire 
plant community composition through reductions in native species, including perennial 
native forbs, shrubs, and colonizing annual/biennial species.  The high financial cost and 
low potential for effectiveness should call into question the continued practice of seeding 
areas burned in high-severity wildfires.

CHAPTER ONE 
Introduction 
Land managers have applied seed to areas burned by high-severity wildfires for 
nearly a century (Beyers 2004).  The intention of post-fire seeding has shifted over time.  
Early efforts were focused on increasing forage and browse for cattle and wildlife species 
(Beyers 2004).  More recent efforts are focused on promoting native species regeneration 
and reducing water runoff and soil erosion (Robichaud et al. 2000, Beyers 2004).  
Presently, the rationale for seeding following fires as stated in federal policy is: 
“determine the need for and prescribe and implement emergency treatments to minimize 
threats to life or property or to stabilize and prevent further unacceptable degradation of 
natural and cultural resources resulting from the effects of a fire” (USDA 2004).  Federal 
policy states the purpose of post-fire seeding is to reduce runoff and soil erosion and 
prevent invasion by non-native species (USDA 2004).   
Post-fire seeding is based on the expectation that high amounts of vegetative 
cover will result in increased water infiltration into the soil (Debano et al. 1998, Pannkuk 
and Robichaud 2003).  Conceptually, seeded species are expected to grow rapidly and 
provide abundant vegetative cover which will directly protect soil from rainsplash 
erosion (Robichaud et al. 2000).  The roots of seeded species are intended to aid in the 
removal of hydrophobic soil layers that may form as a result of fire and to encourage 
water infiltration into the soil surface (Debano et al. 1998, Robichaud et al. 2000).   
Species selected for post-fire seeding treatments have shifted over time but have 
generally been quick-growing species intended to provide high amounts of above-ground 
vegetative cover and below-ground biomass (Beschta et al. 2003, Beyers 2004).  Over the 

12 
 
past few decades, seeds of non-native annual cereal grains or sterile graminoid hybrids 
have been most commonly utilized (Beyers 2004).  United States (U.S.) federal policy 
encourages the use of native species when they are available (USDA 2004).  However, 
inclusion of native species in post-fire seed mixes is rare due to unavailability of locally 
collected seed stock and high costs (Beschta et al. 2003).  Several studies have reported 
that when native species are included in post-fire seed mixes, the natives are typically not 
from locally occurring populations, but instead originate from hybridized field-grown 
sources (Robichaud et al. 2000, Barclay et al. 2004, Hunter et al. 2006, Kuenzi et al. 
2008).  Most commonly, post-fire native seed mixes include native seed and non-native 
cereal grains seeded together (Barclay et al. 2004, Hunter et al. 2006, Kuenzi et al. 2008).  
This practice is controversial because seed mixes that include natives and cereal grains 
have been shown to reduce native species success and seeding with native hybrids may 
have long-term negative effects on the genetic make-up of locally adapted species (Millar 
and Libby 1989, Zelnik et al. 2008).     
Previous post-wildfire seeding research has indicated low success rates of seeding 
and frequent negative ecological impacts to native plant regeneration (Robichaud et al. 
2000, Beyers 2004).  Forested ecosystems generally have very low values of exposed 
bare ground with as much as 80% of the ground covered by vegetation, litter, and duff 
with correspondingly low runoff and erosion rates (Debano et al. 1998, Johansen et al. 
2001).  Hydrological studies indicate runoff and erosion rates are reduced to background 
levels when ground cover increases above 60% and that the risk of increased runoff and 
erosion is greatest in the first growing season following fire (Benavides-Solorio and 
MacDonald 2001, Johansen et al. 2001, Pannkuk and Robichaud 2003).  These studies 

13 
 
have demonstrated variability in the amount of ground cover required to reduce runoff 
and erosion; the range from forested ecosystems is from 40-70% (Wagenbrenner et al. 
2006).  Studies report consistent and significant decreases in runoff and erosion when 
bare ground is <60% and vegetative cover is >60%, and these are commonly-used target 
levels employed by researchers and land managers (Robichaud et al. 2000, Beyers 2004, 
Keeley 2004).  Many post-fire seeding studies from forested ecosystems report vegetative 
cover values in the first growing season following fire of <30% (Robichaud et al. 2000, 
Barclay et al. 2004, Beyers 2004, Hunter et al. 2006, Wagenbrenner et al. 2006, 
Robichaud et al. 2006).  Those studies that report higher levels of vegetative cover from 
seeded species commonly report negative impacts to native plant regeneration 
(Amaranthus et al. 1993, Keeley 2004).  These impacts include reduced species richness, 
reduced regeneration of post-fire endemic species, and reductions or exclusion of long-
lived perennials, shrubs, and conifers important for long-term soil stability and ecological 
functioning (Schoennagel and Waller 1999, Keeley 2004, Kruse et al. 2004).   
Plant community composition and species richness are influenced by high 
dominance of one or a few species in an environment, and seeding may increase 
competition for resources in post-fire environments (Grace 1999, Grime 2001, Smith et 
al. 2004).  The quick growth attributes that make seeded species desirable from the 
perspective of establishing abundant and rapid vegetative cover are correlated with rapid 
utilization of resources (Hunter and Omi 2006).  Seeded non-native species can utilize 
soil moisture and nutrients at rapid rates and potentially gain a competitive advantage 
over native species (Amaranthus et al. 1993, Hunter and Omi 2006).  High dominance of 
one or a few species in an ecosystem may limit recruitment and decrease species richness 

14 
 
(Smith et al. 2004).  Several studies have demonstrated that when seeded species 
dominate in terms of high cover relative to all other species, species richness and 
diversity are decreased (Conard et al. 1991, Amaranthus et al. 1999, Barclay et al. 2004, 
Keeley 2004).  
Due to the stochastic nature of wildfires, post-fire seeding studies which utilize a 
controlled, replicated, and randomized experimental design are rare (Robichaud et al. 
2000).  Most post-wildfire seeding studies have been conducted in an opportunistic 
fashion in that they observe the effects of seeding treatments applied by land 
management agencies.  Large-scale seeding treatments are commonly applied via aerial 
applications.  This is appropriate for landscape-scale treatments, but can create 
imprecision in research, in that the amount of seed applied to a given study plot is 
variable.  Researchers have also indicated difficulty in locating unseeded areas to use as 
control areas (Schoennagel and Waller 1999, Barclay et al. 2004).   
In this study, I took advantage of three separate, high-severity wildfires to 
quantify the effects and effectiveness of native and non-native seeding in the first and 
second years following high-severity wildfires in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa C. 
Lawson) forests using controlled, replicated, and randomized experimental seeding 
treatments.  The primary goal of the analyses of the first year data was to determine if 
seeding was effective at creating high vegetative cover, reducing bare ground, or 
reducing non-native species abundance.  I then used data from the first and second year 
following fire, collected from two fires, to examine if seeding affected post-fire plant 
community regeneration, including composition and abundance of life-form groups and 
individual plant species.

CHAPTER TWO 
Literature Review 
Wildfires are a recurring and important component of ecosystems across the 
western United States; but alterations caused by Euro-American settlement and 
subsequent management practices have negatively impacted forest structure and 
functioning (Agee 1993, Fulé et al. 1997).  Fires are integral in maintaining ecosystem 
attributes including forest vegetative structure, composition, and nutrient cycling 
(DeBano et al. 1998).  In many western U.S. forests, fire suppression, livestock grazing, 
and logging have altered forest structure and composition, and thus presettlement fire 
regimes (Agee 1993, Covington and Moore 1994, Fulé et al. 1997).  Fire regimes of 
forest types with long fire return intervals and characteristically high-severity fire, such 
as some mixed-conifer and spruce-fir forests, may be relatively unaffected by a century 
of fire suppression (Agee 1993, Fulé et al. 2003).  In contrast, forests with historical fire 
regimes that included short fire return intervals typified by low-severity fire may be the 
most structurally altered and also at high risk for stand-replacing fires (Covington and 
Moore 1994, Fulé et al. 1997). 
Increases in the extent and severity of wildfires in some western forests are also 
linked with drought cycles and climate fluctuations (Agee 1993, McKenzie et al. 2004, 
Westerling 2006).  Long-term studies on forest dynamics show an increase in tree 
mortality across the western United States and indicate climate fluctuations as a potential 
driver of the change (Van Mantgem et al. 2009).  Climate modeling suggests that some 
forests, particularly those in the southwestern U.S., will continue to experience lower 
precipitation that will further affect future fire regimes (Seager et al. 2007). Thus, with a 

19 
 
legacy of management actions that altered ecosystem attributes in some forests, climate 
change, and increasing tree mortality, it is likely that high-severity wildfires will continue 
to occur in the western U.S. 
The shift from frequent low intensity surface fires to large scale high-severity 
wildfires in southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa C. Laws.) forests may have 
long-term effects on the structure and composition of plant communities (Crawford et al. 
2001, Keeley et al. 2003, Savage and Mast 2005).  Historic fire regimes were 
characterized by low severity frequent fires with return intervals of between 2-20 years; 
but presently return intervals and severity are greater than the historic reference 
conditions (Baisan and Swetnam 1990, Fulé et al. 1997).  Savage and Mast (2005) noted 
two discrete possible trajectories for ponderosa pine forests that experienced high-
severity wildfires.  The first involved dense regeneration of ponderosa pine trees leading 
to the continued high potential for recurring high-severity fires; the second was a lack of 
recruitment of conifers and establishment of persistent grass and shrubland communities 
(Savage and Mast 2005).  While the ultimate fate of plant communities following high-
severity wildfires in southwestern ponderosa pine forests is uncertain, it is clear that the 
immediate effects often include altered plant community composition and changes to 
ecosystem functioning (Schoennagel and Waller 1999, Crawford et al. 2001, Keeley et al. 
2003, Laughlin et al. 2004).  
Undisturbed forested ecosystems have high proportions of ground covered by 
vegetation and litter, resulting in very low runoff and erosion rates (Debano et al. 1998).  
Commonly pre-fire ground cover exceeds 80% in many forest types (Robichaud et al. 
2000).  By definition, high-severity wildfires remove or consume large percentages of 

20 
 
standing crop, litter, and duff layers (Ryan and Noste 1985).  This reduction in ground 
cover can lead to a decrease in water infiltration into the soil, increase rain splash erosion, 
and contribute to increases in sheet and overland flows, all of which can result in high 
sediment yields and erosion (DeBano et al. 1998, MacDonald and Huffman 2004).  
Severe erosion can negatively impact water quality, riparian species, instream species, 
and potentially affect long-term ecosystem productivity and biodiversity (Robichaud et 
al. 2000).  These effects are of particular concern to land managers as human populations 
near forests (wildland urban interface) are increasing (USDA 2004).   
Attempts to ameliorate the effects of high-severity wildfires began as early as the 
1920’s, and were funded and implemented by federal and state land management 
agencies (Robichaud et al. 2000, Beyers 2004). The majority of these early attempts were 
focused on broadcast seed applications of native and non-native grasses and forbs with 
the intended goal of reducing erosion and increasing forage for domestic livestock 
(Robichaud et al. 2000, Beschta et al. 2003, Beyers 2004).  In 1974, the federal 
government formalized a method for evaluating and implementing treatments designed to 
reduce the impacts of high-severity wildfires (Robichaud et al. 2000).  This 
institutionalization of post-fire response resulted in the formation of interagency Burn 
Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) teams to evaluate post-fire conditions.  The 
stated purpose of these teams is to: “determine the need for and prescribe and implement 
emergency treatments to minimize threats to life or property or to stabilize and prevent 
further unacceptable degradation of natural and cultural resources resulting from the 
effects of a fire” (USDA 2004).  Targeted areas for treatments are commonly high-
severity portions of wildfires determined to have high potential for erosion, including 

21 
 
steep slopes that abut watersheds and tributaries deemed vulnerable to negative effects of 
post-fire erosion, and are determined to pose a threat to life or property (USDA 2004).   
Treatments commonly applied to burned areas in an attempt to reduce runoff and 
erosion include mulching, felling of trees along slope contours, and broadcast seeding 
(Robichaud et al. 2000, USDA 2004).  Seeding treatments are by far the most commonly 
and widely applied (Robichaud et al. 2000, Beschta et al. 2003, Beyers 2004, USDA 
2004).  Federal policy states that seed of native species should be utilized in post-fire 
seeding treatments whenever possible; however native seed is often unavailable, 
expensive, or originates from unknown genetic stock; therefore  the inclusion of native 
seed in post-fire applications is limited (Richards et al. 1998, Robichaud et al. 2000, 
Beyers et al. 2004, USDA 2004). Presently, quick growing non-native annual cereal 
grains are most often seeded on wildfires (Richards et al. 1998, Robichaud et al. 2000, 
Beyers 2004, USDA 2004).  The stated purpose of post-fire seeding is to establish 
vegetative cover as quickly as possible, with the goal to reduce bare ground and prevent 
or reduce erosion, to promote ecosystem rehabilitation, and to prevent invasion by non-
native species (Robichaud et al. 2000, Beschta et al. 2003, USDA 2004).  
Seeding treatments, bare ground, and vegetative cover 
Seeding treatments are predicated upon the negative correlation between percent 
ground cover with runoff and erosion rates (Robichaud et al. 2000, Beyers 2004).  
Conceptually the relationship between cover and reduced erosion is twofold.  First, 
standing crop and vegetative cover prevent rainsplash and sheet erosion by intercepting 
precipitation before it strikes the soil surface (Debano et al. 1998).  Second, the roots of 
vegetation contribute to water infiltration into the soil and can aid in the deterioration of 

22 
 
hydrophobic soil layers that may result from high-severity wildfires, especially fires with 
long residence time as a result of high fuel accumulations (Debano et al. 1998).  Several 
studies suggest that in a forested ecosystem with 75% of the ground covered by 
vegetation or litter, runoff and erosion are low, with only 2% of rainfall becoming surface 
runoff (Debano et al. 1998, Robichaud et al. 2000). In post-burn ecosystems with less 
than 10% ground cover, runoff can increase to over 70% with correspondingly high 
increases in erosion rates (Agee 1993, Debano et al. 1998, Robichaud et al. 2000).  In 
many forested ecosystems, 60% ground cover appears to be sufficient to reduce erosion 
rates to approximate pre-fire conditions (Agee 1993, Robichaud et al. 2000).  Thus, a 
target of 60% ground cover is often the primary response variable considered in 
evaluating the effectiveness of post-wildfire seeding (Robichaud et al. 2000, Beyers 
2004). 
Robichaud et al. (2000) used internal (Forest Service) reports and published 
articles to examine the effectiveness of post-fire seeding treatments.  Vegetative cover 
data presented in the original 2000 report are summarized in Table 1, excluding all 
reports from non-forested ecosystems, and adding results from articles not published in 
the original report and those published since 2000.  Of the 18 studies considered here 
(Table 1), three seeding treatments achieved 60% (+/-5%) vegetative cover, and one 
unseeded control achieved 60% (+/-5%) vegetative cover in the first year following fire.  
Three studies reported the difference between seeded and unseeded plots to be 
statistically significant, with seeded plots having higher total cover.  In ten of the studies, 
the unseeded control had equal or higher total vegetative cover (+/-5%) compared to 
seeded treatments.  The fact that less than 16% of reviewed studies achieved the target 

23 
 
60% vegetative cover calls into question the efficacy of this practice.  In all of the studies 
(where information was provided) natural regeneration from ruderal species, seedbanks, 
and resprouting species was strong.  This is illustrated by the 56% of the studies where 
unseeded areas had equal or higher vegetative cover compared to seeded areas.    
Post-fire seeding studies in ponderosa pine forest are relatively few, and those that 
have been conducted show limited ability of seeded species to increase ground cover 
following fire.  Of the studies considered here (Table 1), five are from ponderosa pine 
ecosystems; only one of these occurred in the semi-arid southwestern region of the 
United States (Arizona and New Mexico).  Barclay et al. (2004) in New Mexico and 
Wagenbrenner et al. (2006) in Colorado ponderosa pine forest both examined the results 
of seeding treatments applied by the federal governments Burned Area Emergency 
Rehabilitation (BAER) program.  Both of these studies examined above-ground 
vegetative cover and found no difference between seeded and unseeded areas in the first 
year following fire (Barclay et al. 2004, Wagenbrenner et al. 2006).  Barclay et al. (2004) 
attributed low cover values to low precipitation over the study period.   
United States federal policy mandates the inclusion of native seed into post-fire 
rehabilitation seed mixes when available and economically viable (Richards et al. 1998). 
One recent study found seeding with native species after wildfires was as effective as 
seeding with non-natives, although unseeded controls had comparable rates of vegetative 
cover in the first post-fire year (Thompson et al. 2006).  This study was conducted after a 
high-severity wildfire with both native and non-native seed in pinyon-juniper (Pinus 
edulis Engelm.- Juniperus osteosperma [Torr.] Little) woodland and sagebrush steppe 
ecosystems in Utah.  They found native seed produced higher or equivalent cover as non-

24 
 
native seed mixes in the first and second year post-fire and that unseeded controls had 
equivalent or higher vegetative cover and density as areas seeded with native mixes 
(Thompson et al. 2006).   
Other studies have examined the effectiveness of native seeding in ponderosa pine 
forest in the context of forest restoration including prescribed fire and forest thinning 
(Springer and Laughlin 2004, Daniels et al. 2008).  These studies show increases in 
species richness as a result of seeding but no significant increase in vegetative cover as a 
result of seed additions (Springer and Laughlin 2004, Daniels et al. 2008), simply 
showing the species were able to establish but not demonstrating any functional 
advantage especially in the context of providing higher vegetative cover to prevent 
erosion.  As in the case of Barclay et al. (2004), these studies attribute low vegetative 
cover following seeding to low precipitation (Springer and Laughlin 2004, Moore et al. 
2006, Daniels et al. 2008), but other factors such as ungulate grazing may also influence 
post-fire vegetative cover (Sabo et al. 2009).   
Ungulate grazing, like fire, is a form of disturbance that has differential impacts 
on species abundance and diversity (Oesterheld and Osvaldo 1990, Keeley et al. 2003).  
Livestock grazing has been linked with non-native species invasions and increased 
erosion (Fleischner 1994, Belsky et al. 1999).  There is also a concern that livestock 
grazing will reduce establishment of post-fire vegetation and thus slow ecosystem 
rehabilitation (Beschta et al. 2003).  Grazing can reduce growth of native species, 
especially at early growth stages (Gonzales and Arcese 2008).  In northern Arizona, 
ponderosa pine forests ungulate livestock grazing has been shown to reduce richness and 
abundance of herbaceous plant communities (Bakker and Moore 2007).  Grazing by elk 

25 
 
(Cervus elaphus) has also been shown to reduce growth of native vegetation following 
forest restoration treatments, such as forest thinning and prescribed burning (Huffman 
and Moore 2004).   
Seed additions, plant community composition, and species richness 
A stated purpose of post-fire seed additions is to promote ecosystem rehabilitation 
(Robichaud et al. 2000, USDA 2004).  The concept that adding annual species to the 
post-fire environment will promote ecosystem rehabilitation is informed by the theory of 
directional succession which predicts post-disturbance landscapes will be dominated by 
ruderal species, followed by plants with different competitive and recruitment strategies 
(Allred and Clements 1949, Grime 1977).  However, this may not be the realized pattern 
of post-fire plant regeneration, as mosaic burn patterns and residual plant communities 
may present different trajectories for plant community development (Platt et al. 2002).  If 
mosaic burn patterns, residual plant communities, soil seed banks, and an influx of 
ruderal species all contribute to the post-fire plant community composition, then seed 
introductions may alter plant community development and have implications for 
community composition and potentially community trajectories in the short and long 
term (Schoennagel and Waller 1999, Keeley 2004).  
Successional Models and Mosaic Burn Patterns 
In its simplest form, the basic model of plant succession as proposed by Clements 
focused on directional changes in plant community composition following disturbance, or 
based on a theoretical ecological blank slate (Allred and Clements 1949).  In this model, 
following a catastrophic disturbance such as a high-severity wildfire, species regeneration 
and compositional changes would proceed in a particular order and be determined by 

26 
 
specific plant life history traits based on reproductive and colonization strategies (Allred 
and Clements 1949, Grime 1977).  Using Grime’s (1977) terminology, ruderal (R-
selected) species would be the first to colonize a disturbed area and would be followed by 
competitive (C-selection) species.  Bradshaw (1984) used this Clementsian model of 
directional succession to predict plant community regeneration after severe disturbances.  
He predicted plant communities would follow a linear and parallel pattern of 
development from degraded to aggraded.  In this model, ecosystem structure (species 
richness) would change in a parallel manner with ecosystem function (biomass and 
nutrient cycling) (Bradshaw 1984).  
          More recent research has shown that the complex dynamics of post-disturbance 
ecosystem regeneration and species recruitment and survival patterns do not fit well with 
Clements’ linear succession model (Platt and Connell 2003, Anand and Desrochers 2004, 
Cortina et al. 2006).  This may be especially true in post-wildfire ecosystems where 
seeding treatments are applied (Keeley 2004).  Residual plant communities, differing 
effects on plant functional groups, and non-linear and negative relationships between 
species composition and function have been found (Bakker and Berendse 1999, Platt et 
al. 2002).  High-severity wildfires generally result in non-catastrophic results; that is, 
with some patches of residual plant communities interspersed within the burn area, with 
non-uniform mosaic spatial patterns of disturbance (Platt et al. 2002).  Mosaic 
disturbance patterns will result in islands of residual plant survivors available for 
colonization of burned areas and result in non-linear patterns of species recruitment and 
regeneration (Platt et al. 2002, Anand and Desrochers 2004).  

27 
 
Research in coniferous forests shows mixed results as to how seeding influences 
successional pathways and plant community development after fire.  In a California 
ponderosa pine forest two years after wildfire and seeding, researchers found that cover 
and species richness of forbs, shrubs and conifers declined as the cover of the seeded 
grass (annual ryegrass, Lolium multiflorum Lam.) increased (Conard et al. 1991).  This 
study showed that only two years after fire, plant species associated with later seral stages 
were already colonizing unseeded burned areas (Conard et al. 1991).   Keeley (2004) 
showed seeding with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) after a high-severity fire in ponderosa 
pine forest reduced species richness and cover of ruderal species most dramatically, but 
also reduced richness and cover of perennial species.  These studies indicate seed 
additions may be co-opting the role of post-fire followers (Schoennagel and Waller 1999, 
Keeley 2004).  In contrast, Kuenzi et al. (2008) examined plant regeneration in different 
burn severity classes after the large Rodeo-Chediski fire in northern Arizona and found 
that several years after fire seeded species had declined (Kuenzi et al. 2008).  A primary 
difference between these studies is seeded species abundance, suggesting that when the 
seeded species produces enough vegetative cover to affect runoff and erosion rates, there 
may be detrimental effects to plant community development.   
Post-fire Seed Introductions and Community Development 
Annual cereal grains are often selected for post-fire seeding due to their qualities 
of quick growth, extensive fibrous root systems, and because they are non-reproducing or 
have low reproductive potential in forested ecosystems (Robichaud et al. 2000, USDA 
2004).  In ponderosa pine forests, post-fire seeded species can have temporary high 
abundance values and then decline over time (Schoennagel and Waller 1999).  However, 

28 
 
there is debate as to whether these seeded species inhibit or facilitate plant community 
development (Beyers 2004, Barclay et al. 2004, Keeley 2004).   
There is some evidence that seeding may reduce the abundance of fire-following 
species.  Ruderal forbs are an important part of the post-fire plant community in many 
forested ecosystems (Laughlin et al. 2004, Keeley 2004), and may be reduced in 
abundance in response to post-fire seeding (Barclay et al. 2004, Schoennagel and Waller 
1999).  A reduction in the abundance of ruderal species may be desirable if the colonizers 
are non-native invaders (Thompson et al. 2006); in contrast, such reductions may be 
deleterious to local biological diversity if ruderal fire-followers are natives or endemics 
whose life cycle depends on the post-fire environment (Keeley 2004).  
Competition from seeded species can reduce abundance of long-lived foundation 
species.   In many plant communities, dominant conifers and shrubs are considered 
foundation species and as such have a large influence over many ecosystem processes, 
community composition, and may stabilize abiotic components of ecosystems 
(Buonopane et al. 2005, Ellison et al. 2005).  Thus reestablishing these dominant plants 
within an ecosystem is important for restoring community composition, structure, and 
long-term ecosystem rehabilitation.  However, several studies documented decreased 
conifer establishment in seeded plots (Schoennagel and Waller 1999, Kruse et al. 2004, 
Keeley 2004).  These studies hypothesized that seeded species out-competed conifers for 
resources (Schoennagel and Waller 1999, Anderson and Brooks 1975).  Amaranthus et 
al. (1990) suggested that depression of mycorrhizal associations may be a contributing 
factor of decreased shrub and conifer establishment in post-fire seeded areas.  Seeded 
annual grasses do not support ectomycorrhizal fungi important to conifers and may have 

29 
 
deleterious effects on pine seedling establishment; these relationships vary more for 
shrubs and effects will depend on the shrub species present in the plant community 
(Amaranthus and Perry 1987, Amaranthus et al. 1990).  Together, high dominance and 
out-competing of shrubs and conifers for resources, coupled with reductions in 
mycorrhizal associations, may be sufficient to explain reductions in shrub and conifer 
abundance in some post-fire seeding studies.  
Seeding quick-growing annual grasses after high-severity fire relies on the 
concept that these plants will stabilize the ecosystem, reduce erosion, and facilitate plant 
community regeneration (USDA 2004).  The idea that non-native seeding promotes 
ecosystem rehabilitation has been contradicted by several post-fire and post-disturbance 
studies.  Zelnik et al. (2008) conducted roadside revegetation experiments with seed 
mixes that were comprised mostly of native species but containing varying percentages of 
annual cereal grains.  They found plots seeded with annual non-natives delayed plant 
community regeneration and reduced species richness (Zelnik et al. 2008).  Reduced 
species richness as a result of seeding has been documented in ponderosa pine (Anderson 
and Brooks 1975, Barclay et al. 2004, Keeley 2004), pinyon-juniper woodlands 
(Thompson et al. 2006), and chaparral ecosystems (Taskey et al. 1989, Keeley et al. 
2006).  Several studies demonstrate seeded species dominance may reduce species 
richness (Conard et al. 1991, Barclay et al. 2004, Hunter and Omi 2006).  A mechanism 
explaining species richness reduction as related to biomass was presented by Grime 
(1973) and again by Grace (1999).  They both examined herbaceous plant communities 
and hypothesized that habitats with very high productivity would have low species 
densities.  In a post-fire seeding study, Keeley (2004) observed  a reduction in species 

30 
 
richness from an average of 152 species in unseeded plots to an average of 104 in plots 
seeded with wheat, thus offering support for  Grime’s (1973) and Grace’s (1999) 
hypothesis.  He also reported an average percent vegetative cover of 95% in seeded plots, 
of which 67% was contributed by the seeded wheat (Keeley 2004), indicating seeded 
species dominance likely plays an important role.  Tilman (1995) further discussed 
competition theory and argued that a primary force structuring plant communities is 
competition between species for resources.  Hunter and Omi (2006) supported this idea; 
they correlated high post-fire dominance and productivity of seeded species with 
increases in light and nutrient availability.  This suggests quick-growing seeded annuals 
have a competitive advantage in post-fire landscapes (Hunter and Omi 2006).  
Seeding and non-native species abundance and richness 
Post-wildfire seeding treatments are frequently designed to reduce or prevent non-
native species invasions (Robichaud et al. 2000, USDA 2004).   High-severity wildfires 
consume aboveground biomass and increase the availability of light and nutrients (Ryan 
and Noste 1985, Debano et al. 1998).  As a result of this nutrient-rich post-fire 
environment, increases in abundance and richness of ruderal native and non-native plants 
is well documented in many forested ecosystems, including southwestern ponderosa pine 
forests (Crawford et al. 2001, Keeley et al. 2003, Keeley 2004, Dodge et al. 2008, 
Laughlin and Fulé 2008).   
           The concept that seeded species will reduce non-native species is based on the 
notion that these quick growing, short-lived, seeded annuals will utilize a high percentage 
of available resources thus co-opting them from invading non-native species (Grace 
1999, Robichaud et al. 2000, Grime 2001, Beyers 2004).    Keeley (2004) compared 

31 
 
seeded and unseeded areas and noted a reduction in non-native species richness and cover 
in the first year following fire in a California ponderosa pine forest seeded with winter 
wheat.  Barclay et al. (2004) studied a high-severity burn in a ponderosa pine forest, 
comparing areas seeded with ryegrass to unseeded areas, and found native plant cover, 
total species richness, and cover of non-natives to be lowest in seeded plots.  There is 
concern that the disappearance of short-lived seeded annuals in the second or third post-
treatment growing season may leave open ecological niches that are vulnerable to 
invasion by non-native species in following years (Mooney and Hobbs 2000, Keeley 
2004).  To address this, a few seeding studies in ponderosa pine forest have experimented 
with native perennial seeding in conjunction with forest restoration (thinning and 
burning).  These studies found seeding did little to affect non-native species abundance or 
non-native richness (Springer and Laughlin 2004, Daniels et al. 2008).       
Two distinct patterns of non-native species recruitment following fire have been 
found from post-fire research in ponderosa pine forests.  The first indicates non-native 
species increase following fire and these increases may be positively correlated with fire 
severity (Crawford et al. 2001, Griffis et al. 2001, Barclay et al. 2004, Hunter and Omi 
2006).  The second demonstrates that while ruderal species increase following fire there 
is not a significant increase in non-native species (Huisinga et al. 2005, Kuenzi et al. 
2008).  A significant portion of the differences in conclusions between these studies is 
attributable to the floristic treatments of the species they documented.  Species that 
occupied a large portion of the post-fire plant community in both Crawford et al. (2001) 
and Barclay et al. (2004) are common regionally and classified as native in other research 
and from other floristic sources (Huisinga et al. 2005, USDA Plants 2006, Kuenzi et al. 

32 
 
2008).  These inconsistencies indicate that non-native invasions may not be the inevitable 
result of high-severity fires and that the role of seeding in decreasing invasions is unclear. 
Impacts of Seeding Native Species on Local Gene Pools 
Local genetic adaptations may occur in many plants and can be a source of 
variation that allow local populations to be adapted to site specific conditions (Grant 
1982).  Raabova et al. (2007) demonstrated local adaptation at small scales.  They used 
several common gardens and showed seed germination success was highly correlated to 
site-specific conditions where seed germinated best in its place of origin (Raabova et al. 
2007).  Other experiments have shown this pattern of local adaptation in species that 
occur over broad regional landscapes (Millar and Libby 1989).  Several species have 
within-population variations at the regional scale that infers differential success in 
outplanting experiments (Millar and Libby 1989).  The risk of seeding with native species 
that are not locally adapted is twofold.  First, the seed may be poorly adapted to site-
specific conditions and germination and success of seeding may be reduced (Raabova et 
al. 2007).  Second, gene flow from introduced plants may swamp local populations, 
effectively removing or altering patterns of local adaptations (Jones 1998, McKay et al. 
2005).   
Research investigating the efficacy of seeding with native species following high-
severity wildfires is generally lacking (Beyers 2004).  Several studies have reported on 
seeding of native hybrids following fire (Barclay et al. 2004, Hunter and Omi 2006).  
Hybrids are selected for specific growth attributes and may not be a valid representation 
of how well a particular native species would grow if utilized in post-wildfire seeding 
applications.  Seeding with non-local sources will have the least effect on native gene 

33 
 
pools and the highest likelihood of success if species selected have low genetic variability 
over the entire species range (Millar and Libby 1989).   
Future Research 
The role of seeding after high-severity wildfires in northern Arizona is generally 
understudied.  Of the published studies considered here, only four were conducted in 
ponderosa pine forest (Conard et al. 1991, Barclay et al. 2004, Keeley 2004, 
Wagenbrenner et al. 2006).  Two of those were in southwestern portion of the ponderosa 
pine range: one in Colorado (Wagenbrenner et al. 2006) and one in New Mexico (Barclay 
et al. 2004).  With one exception (Thompson et al. 2006), all of the post-fire seeding 
studies considered here were observational, in that they simply established study plots 
where BAER teams applied seeding treatments.  BAER seeding is generally via aerial 
applications and thus seed spread may be uneven over the landscape.  Further, unseeded 
control plots with similar burn severity, aspect, elevation, and forest types may be 
difficult to establish.  There is very little understanding of the effectiveness of native seed 
mixes in the context of post-fire applications. Further research is required to determine 
the efficacy and effectiveness of post-wildfire seeding, examine the relationship between 
post-fire seeding and non-native species, and test if seeding alters post-fire plant 
community composition.

CHAPTER THREE 
 
Minimal effectiveness of native and non-native seeding  
following three high-severity wildfires 
Abstract 
The rationale for seeding following high-severity wildfires is to enhance plant cover and 
reduce bare ground, thus decreasing the potential for soil erosion and non-native plant 
invasion.  However, experimental tests which measure seedings’ effectiveness in meeting 
these objectives in forests are lacking.  We conducted three experimental studies of the 
effectiveness of seeding with non-native (annual ryegrass, Lolium multiflorum (Lam.) and 
wheat, Triticum aestivum L.) and native species (squirreltail (Elymus elymoides (Raf.) 
Swezey), blue grama, (Bouteloua gracilis (Willd. ex Kunth) Lag. ex Griffiths), 
muttongrass (Poa fendleriana, (Steud.) Vasey), scarlet gilia (Ipomopsis aggregata 
(Pursh) V.E. Grant), and purple locoweed (Oxytropis lambertii, Pursh.)) on three Arizona 
wildfires.  Seeding treatments were largely ineffective in increasing vegetative cover or 
decreasing exposed bare ground.  At one treatment at one fire, wheat seeding at the 
Warm Fire, senesced seeded annuals increased litter cover and resulted in lower bare-
ground values than unseeded controls.  Only on one fire did seeded non-native annuals 
establish well, resulting in 20-29% vegetative cover.  On the other two fires, seeded 
cereal grains accounted for <3% cover.  At all fires, native seeded species contributed 
between <1 and ~12% vegetative cover.  On the Warm Fire, total plant cover was higher 
on both areas seeded with annual ryegrass (53% cover) and those seeded with a native 
seed mix (49% cover), as compared to unseeded controls (41% cover).  Vegetative cover 
on all treatments, including unseeded treatments, was at or near 40% the first year 

47 
 
following fire, at all three study sites.  Non-native species richness and abundance did not 
differ among treatments at any fire.  We attributed the ineffectiveness of seeding in 
altering the abundance or richness of non-native species in the first year to two factors.  
First, non-native abundance and richness was low on all three fires.  Second, even on the 
most successful seeding treatments on the Warm Fire, resulting plant cover was 
inadequate to exclude non-natives.  This study adds to growing evidence that post-fire 
seeding is ineffective in enhancing post-fire plant cover and reducing invasive non-native 
plants.

Introduction 
High-severity wildfires in forested ecosystems consume high percentages of 
above-ground biomass, vegetative cover, litter, and duff (Ryan and Noste 1985).   The 
increase in bare mineral soil, light, and nutrient availability following high-severity 
wildfires may increase water runoff, soil erosion, and facilitate non-native plant invasions 
(Benavides-Solorio and MacDonald 2001, Crawford et al. 2001, Johansen et al. 2001).  In 
an attempt to ameliorate the effects of high-severity wildfires, resource managers 
frequently apply post-wildfire treatments, such as contour felling of logs, mulching, and 
seeding.  Due to its low cost, ease of application, and long history of use, seeding is the 
most widely applied, post-wildfire treatment (Beyers 2004). Species used in post-wildfire 
seeding are most commonly quick-growing non-native grasses (Robichaud et al. 2000).  
Quick growth is important because the risk of increased runoff and erosion is highest in 
the first year post-fire (Robichaud et al. 2006, Wagenbrenner et al. 2006).  Seeded species 
most commonly utilized include non-native cereal grains, which are either sterile hybrids 
or annuals with low reproductive potential in forested ecosystems (Robichaud et al. 
2000).  Seeding with longer-lived native perennial species has been recommended as a 
method for producing more persistent vegetative cover and standing crop compared to 
seeding with annuals (Richards et al. 1998, Beschta et al. 2003).  However, use of native 
seeded species in post-wildfire rehabilitation has been limited and there is relatively little 
published information on the effectiveness of native species in meeting post-fire 
vegetative cover objectives (Bescheta et al. 2003).       
Post-wildfire seeding is predicated on the assumption that seeding will enhance 
plant cover and reduce bare ground, thereby reducing runoff and erosion rates 

49 
 
(Robichaud et al. 2000, Beyers 2004).  Conceptually the relationship between cover and 
reduced erosion is twofold.  First, plant cover prevents rainsplash and sheet erosion by 
intercepting precipitation before it strikes the soil surface (Debano et al. 1998).  Second, 
plant roots increase soil water infiltration and can aid in the deterioration of hydrophobic 
soil layers that may result from high-severity wildfires (Benavides-Solorio and 
MacDonald 2001).   
The proportion of exposed bare ground and ground covered are important 
predictors of post-fire runoff and erosion rates in coniferous forests.  Several studies from 
forested ecosystems have demonstrated significant positive correlations between the 
percentage of exposed bare ground and both water runoff and soil erosion (Johansen et al. 
2001, Benavides-Solorio and MacDonald 2001). These studies have shown consistent 
significant increases in soil loss as exposed soil reaches > 60-70% on severely burned 
areas (Johansen et al. 2001).  Other research has shown a negative correlation between 
ground cover as compared to post-fire water runoff and soil erosion (Johansen et al. 2001, 
Wagenbrenner et al. 2006).  Post-fire erosion studies from coniferous forests support the 
concept that high cover values from plant regeneration result in low amounts of runoff 
and erosion rates (Johansen et al. 2001, Wagenbrenner et al. 2006).  Recent studies from 
coniferous forests including, Colorado ponderosa pine forests and from grand fir (Abies 
grandis Douglas ex D. Don) forests, have demonstrated the range of cover most closely 
associated with low amounts of runoff and erosion is between 50 -70% (Johansen et al. 
2001, Robichaud et al. 2006, Wagenbrenner et al. 2006).  Researchers and land managers 
commonly use 60% cover as a target value in evaluating the effectiveness of seeding 
treatments (Robichaud et al. 2000, Beyers 2004, Keeley 2004, USDA 2004a). 

50 
 
          Preventing or reducing the abundance of invasive non-native species after fire is an 
important management goal of many seeding efforts (Robichaud et al. 2000, Beyers 
2004).  This is based on the idea that seeded species will grow quickly and utilize 
available resources, thus co-opting them from invading non-natives.  Previous research 
has demonstrated the degree to which the seeded species are dominant in the plant 
community may be an important predictor of how effectively non-native species 
abundance is reduced.  Several studies from both wildfires and prescribed burning 
experiments have shown seeding, whether with native or non-native species, had little 
effect on non-native species abundance (Kruse et al. 2004, Springer and Laughlin 2004, 
Daniels et al. 2008, Kuenzi et al. 2008).  What these studies have in common is that they 
reported relatively low dominance of seeded species in the plant community.  In contrast, 
two recent studies demonstrated at least short-term reductions in non-native species 
following post-wildfire seeding with either wheat (Keeley 2004) or native seed mixes 
Thompson et al. 2006); in both cases, seeded species had high dominance in the post-fire 
plant community. 
Experimental tests of the effectiveness of post-wildfire seeding of native and non-
native species in enhancing plant cover and standing crop, reducing bare ground, and 
curtailing invasive non-native plants are rare.  Thompson et al. (2006), who experimented 
with native and non-native seeding in a sagebrush steppe plant community, is a notable 
exception, but we were unable to find similar studies from coniferous forests.  Most 
studies have been opportunistic and observational, in that researchers have established 
study areas within large landscape level seeding treatments implemented by managers 
following fire.  This has led to difficulting in locating unseeded control areas for 

51 
 
comparisons as well as uncertaintiy over the amount of seed applied at the plot level of 
observation (Schoennagel and Waller 1999, Barclay et al. 2004, Kruse et al. 2004).  The 
result of these difficulties can be small sample sizes and low certainty of conclusions.   
For this study we took advantage of three separate, high-severity wildfires which 
occurred in ponderosa pine forests.  In order to determine the effects and effectiveness of 
native and non-native seeding in the first year following fire we used a controlled, 
replicated, and randomized experimental design.  We hypothesized that seeding would: 
1) decrease bare ground; 2) increase plant canopy cover and standing crop; and 3) reduce 
non-native species abundance and richness.  
Methods 
Study areas 
We selected three wildfires in Arizona ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa C. 
Lawson) forests for this study (Figure 1).  The Potato and Warm Fires burned in 2006; 
the Birdie Fire burned in 2007.  We sampled immediately post-burn and for a full year 
after fire, the period within which plant establishment is required to meet rehabilitation 
objectives.  Replicated, randomized, controlled experimental units were established in 
areas dominated by ponderosa pine, within four weeks of fire containment, and were 
located within high-severity portions of the burn, as defined by federal Burned Area 
Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) teams.  Severity classification was ground-truthed by 
visually assessing tree mortality, crown scorch height, and ground char (Ryan and Noste 
1985).   
The fires spanned an elevational and latitudinal gradient (Figure 1).  The Warm 
Fire burned from 8 June to 4 July 2006 on the Kaibab National Forest.  This fire had the 

52 
 
highest average elevation, 2400 m; the greatest average yearly precipitation, 64.5 cm; and 
occurred on Mollic Eutroboralf soils derived from a limestone parent material (Brewer et 
al. 1991, WRCC 2009).  The Potato Fire burned from 6-28 June 2006 on the Apache-
Sitgreaves National Forest.  This fire had the lowest average elevation, 2050 m; the 
lowest average yearly precipitation, 52.4 cm; and occurred on Mollic Eutroboralf soils 
derived from basaltic parent material (Laing et al. 1991, WRCC 2009).  The Birdie Fire 
burned from 6-15 July 2007 on the Coconino National Forest.  The average elevation, 
2200 m, and average annual precipitation, 59 cm, are intermediate to those at the Warm 
and Potato Fires (Miller et al. 1991, WRCC 2009).  Soils at the Birdie Fire are classified 
as Mollic Eutroboralfs from basaltic parent materials (Miller et al. 1991).  Precipitation at 
all three sites approximated long term averages in the year of fire and the first year 
following fire (Figure 2).  Fire containment, plot establishment, and seeding all occurred 
within one to three weeks of the onset of high intensity summer monsoonal precipitation 
(Figure 2, WRCC 2009).   
Experimental Design and Treatments 
We established fifteen 20- X 25-m (500-m2) plots per treatment at each fire.  Plots 
were located within unseeded areas of high-severity burn, with slopes between 5 and 
25%.  The overstory was dominated by ponderosa pine prior to the fires. Data were 
collected immediately following fire and in the first  of the following year.   Experimental 
treatments were: 1) seeding with common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.); 2) seeding with 
annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.); 3) seeding with a native seed mix including: 
squirreltail (Elymus elymoides (Raf.) Swezey), blue grama, (Bouteloua gracilis (Willd. ex 
Kunth) Lag. ex Griffiths), muttongrass (Poa fendleriana, (Steud.) Vasey), scarlet gilia 

53 
 
(Ipomopsis aggregata (Pursh) V.E. Grant), and purple locoweed (Oxytropis lambertii, 
Pursh.); plus 4) unseeded control. Due to fire size treatments varied between fires.  At the 
Potato and Birdie Fires, treatments 1, 3, and 4 were tested; at the Warm Fire all four 
treatments were tested. Our target seeding rate was 403 pure live seeds (PLS)/m2 (Table 
1), based on the USDA (2004b) recommended rate of 269 PLS/m2 with an increase of 1.5 
to 2 times for broadcast seeding.  These seeding rates are similar to those used in other 
post-fire seeding experiments (Robichaud et al. 2000, Thompson et al. 2006).  Seed was 
hand broadcast at each plot immediately following plot establishment.       
Species used in seed treatments were selected because they are commonly used by 
land managers or show promising results in studies in this region (Jones 1998, Robichaud 
et al. 2000, Elseroad et al. 2003, Barclay et al. 2004).  Annual ryegrass was seeded on 
portions of the Warm Fire and the 1997 Dome Fire in New Mexico (Barclay et al. 2004).  
Wheat was seeded on portions of the Potato Fire and the 2002 Rodeo-Chediski Fire in 
Arizona (Kuenzi et al. 2008). We included species with broad geographic distributions 
and included both cool-season (C3: bottlebrush squirreltail,muttongrass, and purple 
locoweed) and warm-season (C4: blue grama and scarlet gilia) plants in an effort to 
enhance plant cover throughout the growing season (Dodge 2004, Springer and Laughlin 
2004, Moore et al. 2006, Daniels et al. 2008).     
Response Variables 
We estimated total plant canopy cover, litter, rock, and bare ground cover, plus 
cover by life form (graminoids, shrubs, and forbs) and by species in fifty, 20- X 50-cm 
(0.1-m2) quadrats per plot.  We placed the quadrats at 1-m intervals on the right side of 5 
permanent transects in each plot.  We estimated cover by classes (1 = <1%, 2 = 1-5%, 3 = 

54 
 
6-25%, 4 = 26-50%, 5 = 51-75%, 6 = 76-95%, 7 = 96-100%) modified from Daubenmire 
(1959).  We added the <1% class based on Bailey and Poulton’s (1968) recommendation 
to better describe vegetation occurring in very small amounts (e.g., 0-1 percent).  We 
used mid-points of each cover class to calculate averages. 
Plant standing crop was sampled in each plot by clipping herbaceous vegetation in 
fifteen, 0.25-m2 circular quadrats, three per transect, randomly placed along the left side 
of each transect. Clipped material was separated by species in the field, placed in paper 
bags, oven dried for 48 hours at 70˚ C, and weighed to the nearest 0.01 g (Moore et al. 
2006).   
All sampling was conducted between the end of July through the end of August, 
in order to capture plant cover and biomass present at the onset of high intensity 
monsoonal rainstorms (WRCC 2009).  These rainstorms account for approximately half 
of yearly precipitation in this region (WRCC 2009).  Plant nomenclature and nativity are 
according to the Plants Database (USDA NRCS 2009).  Plant reference specimens are 
stored at the Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, 
Arizona.  
Statistical Analysis 
Due to differences in site characteristics, dates of burn, and variations in 
treatments applied, we analyzed each fire as a separate experiment.  We tested 
assumptions of normal distribution of data using Shapiro-Wilk goodness of fit test and 
homogeneous variances using Levene test in JMP V 7.0.1 (SAS institute Inc. 2009).  Due 
to non-normality and heterogeneous variances in many of our response variables we used 
nonparametric testing procedures (Anderson 2001).   

55 
 
     We used PERMANOVA analysis in PC-ORD V.5.1 with Bray-Curtis distance 
measures for all analyses, although similar results were observed using Euclidean 
distances (Ludwig and Reynolds 1988, Faith et al. 1987, McCune and Mefford 1999).  
PERMANOVA is a distance-based nonparametric analysis of variance procedure that can 
be used with univariate or multivariate datasets.  We used 9999 permutations per test 
(Anderson 2001).  When significant differences were detected among treatments, we 
used a nonparametric pair-wise a posteriori t-test to separate means (Anderson 2001).  
For all tests we used α = 0.05 to determine significance.    
We tested for differences among treatments immediately post-fire and in the first 
year following fire.  Immediately post-fire, but before seeding treatments were applied, 
we tested for differences in substrate, litter, and plant cover among treatments.  In the 
first year following fire, we tested for differences among treatments in total plant cover, 
standing crop and cover of non-native species (excluding seeded non-natives), litter, and 
bare ground.  We also analyzed cover and standing crop by life-form (graminoids, forbs, 
shrubs) by treatments.   
Results 
Does seeding decrease bare ground? 
Immediately post-fire, before treatments were applied, bare ground ranged from 
42-48% at the Warm Fire, 65-68% at the Potato Fire, and 55-60% at the Birdie Fire (all 
SE’s <5.2%).  There were no significant differences in bare ground among treatments at 
the Potato, Birdie, or Warm Fires (P = 0.86, 0.89, 0.76 respectively).  Litter, rocks, and 
logs accounted for the remainder of ground cover.  Vegetative cover averaged between 
<0.5- 5.0%, with no significant difference among treatments at any fire. 

56 
 
We found only partial support at one fire for the hypothesis that seeding 
significantly decreased bare ground.  In the first year after seeding, bare ground did not 
differ among treatments at the Potato (P = 0.99) or Birdie Fires (P = 0.77).  Bare ground 
differed among treatments only at the Warm Fire, with significantly (P = 0.03) lower 
levels on plots seeded with wheat than unseeded treatments (Figure 3A).  This difference 
was explained by higher levels of litter at the Warm Fire wheat treatments as compared to 
the unseeded treatments (P = 0.02).  Litter cover did not differ among treatments at the 
Potato (P = 0.91) or Birdie Fires (P = 0.88). 
Does seeding increase ground cover, plant cover, and standing crop? 
Warm Fire 
Results from the Warm Fire in the first year following fire offered partial support 
for the hypothesis that seeding increases plant canopy cover but did not support the 
hypothesis that seeding increases plant standing crop.  Total canopy cover differed by 
~13% among treatments and was significantly higher on ryegrass seeded plots (P <0.01) 
and native seeded plots (P = 0.04) compared to unseeded plots (Figure 3B).  However, 
total plant standing crop did not differ among treatments (P = 0.28) (Figure 4A).   
     Seeding altered the abundance of graminoids.  Graminoid cover and standing crop 
differed significantly (P = 0.02 and <0.01) among treatments, with higher graminoid 
cover and standing crop on seeded plots compared to unseeded controls.  Annual ryegrass 
and wheat were major species in terms of canopy cover on their respective treatments 
(Table 2). On the native seed treatment, two seeded grasses, squirreltail and muttongrass 
were dominant in terms of plant cover and standing crop.  Major species in terms of plant 
canopy cover and standing crop on unseeded plots included squirreltail, muttongrass, a 

57 
 
native Carex, and a variety of native forbs.  Graminoid standing crop on the unseeded 
controls was the lowest at 54.4 kg ha-1 (SE 12.5) compared to the native seeded treatment 
at 114.2 kg ha-1 (SE 21.2), the ryegrass at 163 kg ha-1 (SE 36.1), and the wheat treatment 
had the highest at 368.8 kg ha-1 (SE 97.2).  Total forb cover, standing crop, and shrub 
cover did not differ significantly among treatments (P = 0.51, 0.29 and 0.12) (Figure 4A).   
Potato Fire 
Data from the Potato Fire did not support the hypothesis that seeding after high-
severity wildfires increases vegetative cover or standing crop. Total plant canopy cover 
(P = 0.43) and plant standing crop (P = 0.33) did not differ significantly among 
treatments in the first year following fire (Figure 3B, 4B).  Similarly, we did not detect 
significant differences in canopy cover (P = 0.33) or standing crop (P = 0.48) of 
graminoids among treatments (Figure 4B).  Nor was there a significant difference in total 
forb cover (P = 0.51) or standing crop (P = 0.36) among treatments. There were only 
trace amounts of shrub species.   
In contrast to the Warm Fire, species included in the seed mixes were not always the 
major species in terms of plant canopy cover.  Wheat cover averaged <3% on the wheat 
seed treatment, and on the native seed treatment, only two seeded species, blue grama 
and squirreltail, had cover >2% (Table 2B).  Instead, native forbs originating from natural 
regeneration and recruitment dominated plant canopy cover on all treatments the first 
year following burning.   
Birdie Fire 
Data from the Birdie Fire did not support the hypothesis that seeding after high-
severity wildfires increases vegetative cover or standing crop.  Total vegetative cover (P 

58 
 
= 0.31) and standing crop (P = 0.74) did not differ among treatments in the first year 
following fire (Figure 3C).  However, graminoid cover and standing crop differed among 
treatments (P = 0.03 and 0.01), with higher levels on native seeded treatments compared 
to both unseeded and wheat treatments.  Graminoid standing crop on the unseeded 
controls was 58.5kg ha-1 (SE 15.9) compared to 91.8 kg ha-1 (SE 41.2) on the native 
seeded treatment, and 59.5 kg ha-1 (SE 18.7) on the wheat treatment (Figure 4). 
The Birdie Fire was similar to the Potato Fire in that wheat had very low cover in 
the first year following fire (~2%) (Table 2C).  On the native seeding treatment, two 
seeded species, blue grama and squirreltail were major species.  On unseeded plots, 
native forbs and graminoids constituted the majority of the post-fire plant cover.     
Does seeding reduce non-native species? 
Contrary to our hypothesis, seeding did not reduce the abundance or richness of 
non-native species the first year post-burn.  Plant standing crop of non-native species was 
highly variable and did not differ among treatments at any fire (Potato fire: P = 0.17, 
Birdie Fire: P = 0.82; we detected only trace amounts of non-natives at the Warm Fire).   
Non-native species richness (other than the seeded species) ranged from 4 to 11 on the 
three fires and did not differ among treatments on any fire.  
In the first year post-burn at the Warm Fire, we found five non-native species: 
cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.), bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten.), redstem 
stork’s bill (Erodium cicutarium (L.) L’Her. Ex Aiton), common dandelion (Taraxacum 
officinale F.H. Wigg.), and yellow salsify (Tragopogon dubius Scop.).  Richness of non-
natives among treatments was similar, with the exception of yellow salsify, which  was 
not present on the native seeded treatments.  

59 
 
Non-native species at the Potato Fire in the first year following fire were bull 
thistle, redstem stork’s bill, little hogweed (Portulaca oleracea L.), and common mullein.  
Little hogweed was prevalent on all plots but due to its diminutive stature, accounted for 
little standing crop.  Bull thistle was absent from the native seeded plots.  All these 
species made up trace (<2% of total non-native standing crop) amounts except mullein, 
which was responsible for the majority of the non-native standing crop.  Distribution and 
abundance of mullein varied among treatments but not significantly due to the large 
variation.  Mullein occurred on one third of the total plots and accounted for an average 
of  between 7-30% of total standing crop (mullein standing crop: unseeded plots (12.7 kg 
ha-1 SE 8.5), native (40.6 kg ha-1 SE 30.8), and wheat plots (102 kg ha-1 SE 68).   
Eleven non-native species were present at the Birdie Fire (cheatgrass, bull thistle, 
prickly lettuce, prostrate knotweed (Polygonum aviculare L.), little hogweed, Canada 
bluegrass (Poa compressa L.), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), Dalmatian 
toadflax (Linaria dalmatica L. Mill.), common dandelion, yellow salsify, and common 
mullein).  Two species occurred only on native seeded plots (yellow salsify and Canada 
bluegrass).  The two most abundant non-natives were Kentucky bluegrass and common 
mullein; together they accounted for over 90% of non-native standing crop at all 
treatments. Similar to the Potato Fire, the distribution of these species varied greatly, 
occurring on less than one third of the plot.  When these species occurred, they accounted 
for between 21- 40% of total standing crop.

Discussion 
Does seeding decrease bare ground? 
         Immediately post-fire, the percentage of bare ground on two fires was above 55%, 
thus potentially putting these sites at risk for increased sediment loss.  On the Warm Fire, 
percentage of bare ground was lower, but still within the range considered to be at risk 
for increased sediment yields following especially intense storms (Robichaud et al. 2000, 
Wagenbrenner et al. 2006).  A year later, the percentage of bare ground on all treatments 
at the Potato Fire changed very little and remained at levels considered to be at risk for 
increased erosion.  The percentage of bare ground at the Birdie Fire, regardless of 
treatment, had declined to levels considered to be low enough to curtail erosion (Johansen 
et al. 2001).  At the Warm Fire, wheat seeding significantly decreased bare ground 
compared to all other treatments, largely due to increased litter cover from the senesced 
wheat.  Levels of bare ground at the Warm Fire on all treatments, including unseeded 
controls, were low enough to protect sites from all but the most intense storms (Johansen 
et al. 2001, Pannkuk and Robichaud 2003, Groen and Woods 2008).  Thus, with the 
exception of wheat seeding on one fire, seeding treatments were largely ineffective in 
decreasing bare ground.  At two fires, litter accumulations and plant regeneration on all 
treatments, including unseeded treatments, resulted in exposed bare ground values well 
below those associated with increased runoff and erosion (Johansen et al. 2001). 
The ineffectiveness of seeding treatments at reducing bare ground compared to 
the natural regeneration that we documented is similar to several previous post-wildfire 
studies (Robichaud et al. 2006, Wagenbrenner et al. 2006).  In fact, evidence supporting 
the effectiveness of seeding in significantly reducing bare ground is limited. Amaranthus 

61 
 
et al. (1993) reported significant reductions in bare ground following seeding with annual 
ryegrass, and Keeley (2004) reported similar results with wheat seeding at high rates.  In 
both of these studies, and in our one treatment where bare ground was lower, the 
resulting reductions in bare ground were attributable to a thatch layer produced by the 
senesced seeded annuals.    
Does seeding increase plant cover and standing crop? 
Our results, along with previous research, indicate the ability of post-wildfire 
seeding treatments to significantly increase vegetative cover in forested ecosystems in the 
first year following fire is minimally supported.  Less than one quarter of the post-fire 
seeding studies from forested ecosystems considered in Robichaud et al.’s (2000) review, 
as well as those published since 2000, report significant increases in vegetative cover as a 
result of seeding (Table 3).  Where we did find differences in cover resulting from 
seeding, the unseeded treatments averaged 40% cover, whereas the native treatments 
averaged 49%, and the ryegrass averaged 53% cover.  However, whether these 
differences in vegetative cover will confer substantial reductions in post-fire runoff and 
erosion is unclear (Johansen et al. 2001, Benavides-Solorio and MacDonald 2001).  
Using the target cover value of 60%, no treatment achieved this level of cover in the first 
year following fire.        
Although seeding is predicated on the assumption that plant regeneration 
following high-severity fire will be slow and seeding is necessary to increase cover we 
found relatively high amounts of vegetative cover on all of the unseeded treatments at all 
three case studies (Robichaud et al. 2000).  Plant species utilizing multiple regeneration 
and recruitment strategies were present in the post-fire plant community.  These included 

62 
 
perennial plants regenerating from underground persistent root masses, regeneration of 
species that are known to produce persistent seed banks, and colonizing species (Wienk 
et al. 2004, Korb et al. 2005, USDA 2009).   
Standing crop sampling accounts for differences in plant architecture that were 
not captured in vegetative cover values; for example annual ryegrass is relatively 
prostrate (high relative cover and low standing crop) whereas wheat has a vertical 
architecture (low relative cover and high standing crop).  At one fire the increased 
graminoid standing crop we recorded was attributable to seeded annual species.  Seeded 
annuals complete their lifecycle in one growing season, senesce, and in following 
growing seasons can contribute to increased litter but not to belowground biomass 
(Amaranthus et al. 1993, Schoennagel and Waller 1999, Keeley 2004).  In contrast, 
increased graminoid standing crop associated with native seeded perennials will likely 
persist into subsequent years, contributing to belowground biomass (Gill et al. 2002).  
Seeding native perennial species has been promoted as an alternative to annuals to 
encourage longer-term ecosystem rehabilitation (Richards et al. 1998, Beschta et al. 
2003).  Since the risk of soil erosion following fire is the greatest in the first few growing 
seasons a successful treatment would need to produce high amounts of standing crop 
quickly following treatment application (Wagenbrenner et al. 2006).  Neither native nor 
non-native seeding treatments resulted in higher amounts of total standing crop in the 
first year.        
The minimal effectiveness of seeding to increase vegetative cover or standing 
crop that we found may be linked to timing and intensity of precipitation (Robichaud et 
al. 2000).  High intensity rains can physically remove and transport surface materials 

63 
 
including seeds (Johansen et al. 2001).  High intensity storms have been linked to low 
success of seeding in previous research (Robichaud et al. 2006, Wabenbrenner et al. 
2006).  In the mountainous western United States, such high intensity rainstorms 
commonly coincide or immediately follow mid-summer fires (Swetnam and Betancourt 
1990).  At all of our study sites, the onset of high intensity summer rainstorms coincided 
with fire containment, plot establishment, and seeding.   
Another factor that may have limited the success of some of our seeded native 
species is the origin of the seed.  Four of the five seeded species were from regionally 
local sources; however, the squirreltail that comprised almost half of the seed mix was 
from a non-local source and from unidentified genetic origin.  There is evidence, both at 
small and regional scales, showing many species are genetically adapted to site-specific 
conditions (Grant 1982, Millar and Libby 1989, Raabova et al. 2007).  The risk of 
seeding with native species that are not locally adapted is twofold.  First, the seed may be 
poorly adapted to site specific conditions, and germination and success of seeding efforts 
may be reduced (Raabova et al. 2007).  Second, gene flow from introduced plants may 
swamp local populations, effectively removing or altering patterns of local adaptation 
(Jones 1998, McKay et al. 2005).  The degree to which non-local genetics of the native 
seeded species affected our results is unknown, but could have lasting consequences.    
Does seeding reduce non-native species? 
We attribute the ineffectiveness of seeding in altering the abundance or richness 
of non-native species in the first year to two factors.  First, non-native abundance and 
richness were low on all three fires.  Second, even on the most successful seeding 
treatments on the Warm Fire, resulting plant cover was inadequate to exclude non-natives 

64 
 
(Grace 1999, Grime 2001).  Species exclusions are generally reported when the seeded 
species have high cover values or have high dominance in the plant community (Barclay 
et al. 2004, Keeley 2004).  At our two fires where non-natives occurred at higher than 
trace amounts, seeded wheat established <3% cover and seeded native perennial species 
provided between 4% and 14% cover.  Thus, our plots likely had seeded species 
abundance values too low to influence non-native abundance. Thompson et al. (2006) 
experimented with seeding native perennials and found lower non-native annuals on 
native seeded plots in the third growing season post-burn, indicating the potential longer-
term benefits of seeding with native perennial species.       
The initial determination of whether to seed or not to seed to control non-native 
species following a high-severity wildfire is often based on the assumption that non-
natives will increase following fire; however, this may not always be the case.  Recent 
studies show two distinctly different patterns regarding non-native species invasions 
following high-severity fires in ponderosa pine forests.  The first pattern indicates 
colonizing species, including non-natives, increase after high-severity fires and that these 
increases are correlated with increasing fire severity (Crawford et al. 2001, Griffis et al. 
2001, Hunter et al. 2006).  These studies indicate that colonizing non-native forb species 
are particularly abundant in the first few growing seasons following high-severity fires 
(Crawford et al. 2001, Griffis et al. 2001, Hunter et al. 2006).  In contrast, the second 
pattern indicates non-natives do not increase following fire (Huisinga et al. 2005, Kuenzi 
et al. 2008).  Huisinga et al. (2005) attributed low non-native species abundance in a 
National Park to low levels of anthropogenic influence, including minimal livestock 
grazing, logging, and fire suppression.  The implication is that risk of introduction has 

65 
 
been low, resulting in low propagule pressure.  However, our three study sites and those 
considered by Kuenzi et al. (2008) have a long history of active management and 
resource utilization, and both of these studies documented low levels of non-native 
species following high-severity wildfires.   
Some research has indicated the risk of non-native species invasion following 
high-severity disturbances may increase over time (Keeley 2004).  If this is true for semi-
arid ponderosa pine forests, seeding with ephemeral non-native species would not be an 
effective approach for addressing invasions in future growing seasons, as timing of the 
greatest abundance of seeded species would not coincide with non-native species 
increases.  Some researchers have demonstrated longer-lived perennial species may 
reduce the abundance of non-native species in the third growing season and beyond 
(Thompson et al. 2006); implying seeding with native perennials may be a more 
appropriate method of addressing concerns of non-native species invasions.  However, 
studies that have examined non-native species abundances in the second or third year 
following high-severity wildfires in ponderosa pine forests do not demonstrate increases 
in these plants (Huisinga et al. 2005, Kuenzi et al. 2008).   
Although the abundance and richness of non-natives is so far low at our study 
locations, some of the non-native species present are considered “transformer” species 
and may increase, or have negative ecological effects, over time (Richardson et al. 2000).  
Of the 11 non-native species we recorded, six are listed as noxious in at least one 
southwestern state (USDA NRCS 2009, Invaders database 2009).  These include 
cheatgrass, bull thistle, redstem stork’s bill, Dalmation toadflax, little hogweed, and 
common mullein.  Some of these species have been shown to significantly transform 

66 
 
ecosystem structure or function in other forested systems (D’Antonio et al. 1992, Oliff et 
al. 2001, D’Antonio et al. 2004).  Longer term monitoring of these sites is warranted to 
both assess population trajectories of these non-native species and to better evaluate the 
relative effectiveness of seeding treatments in restoring native plant communities. 
Conclusion 
The efficacy of post-wildfire seeding to increase vegetative cover, reduce bare 
ground, and prevent non-native species invasion following fire is not well supported by 
previous research (Robichaud et al. 2000).  Here we provide evidence for low vegetative 
cover and standing crop from seeded species in ponderosa pine forests using a replicated 
experimental design with both native and non-native seeding treatments. 
Seeding has been shown to have negative effects on plant communities, which 
may have long-term negative effects on plant regeneration.  Beyers’ (2004) review noted 
that in the cases when seeding provided cover values thought to significantly reduce 
erosion, there were negative ecological effects as a result of the high abundance of seeded 
species.  Some of these negative effects included reduced abundance of conifer, shrub, 
and annual colonizing species (Schoennagel and Waller 1999, Keeley 2004).  This 
pattern of dominant species reducing abundance of other species in plant communities is 
well documented (Stohlgren et al. 2003, Smith et al. 2004, Spehn et al. 2004) and in this 
context is counter to long-term goals of ecosystem rehabilitation (Keeley 2004).  Thus, 
the paradox of seeding following fires is that seeded species need to achieve high 
amounts of cover to effectively reduce bare ground and non-native species invasions, but 
high cover and dominance of seeded species is often associated with negative impacts to 
plant community regeneration (Beyers 2004, Keeley 2004).   

67 
 
The high financial cost and low potential for effectiveness should call into 
question the continued practice of seeding areas burned in high-severity wildfires.  
Robichaud et al. (2000) estimated that post-wildfire rehabilitation over the last decade 
cost $48 million and Wolfson et al. (2006) reported $6 million was spent in Arizona and 
New Mexico over a two-year period.  Both of these reviews indicate that seeding was the 
most widely applied post-wildfire treatment.  Our study adds to the growing evidence that 
post-fire seeding is often ineffective in enhancing post-fire plant cover, reducing bare 
ground, or reducing invasive non-natives.

CHAPTER FOUR 
 
Post-wildfire seeding alters plant community composition 
Abstract 
Post-wildfire seeding is intended to enhance vegetative cover and thus increase soil water 
infiltration and reduce erosion.  However, successful establishment of seeded species 
may alter post-fire recovery of native species. We used a replicated and randomized 
experimental design to determine the effects of seeding on plant communities following 
two high-severity wildfires in Arizona ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests.  Our 
treatments included seeding with non-native cereal grains (annual ryegrass, Lolium

native species would: 1) reduce total species richness and 2) significantly alter plant 
community composition, and that 3) these changes would persist into the second year 
following fire occurance.  We found that when seeded species accounted for as little as 
10% of total plant cover, cover of annual/biennial forbs as a group was significantly 
reduced and graminoid cover was increased compared to unseeded treatments.  
Significant reductions in cover of individual forbs, perennials, and a shrub species on 
seeded treatments compared to unseeded treatments persisted into the second year 
following fire.  The long-term intent of post-fire seeding is to promote ecosystem 
rehabilitation; thus, alterations to plant community composition may be contrary to these

goals.  Further study would be useful in determining the long-term impact of the 
observations we documented.

Introduction 
In an attempt to ameliorate negative ecological effects of high-severity wildfires, 
land managers routinely apply post-wildfire treatments, the most common of which is 
seeding (Robichaud et al. 2000).  Post-wildfire seeding is intended to quickly reestablish 
vegetative cover, reduce bare ground and thereby increase water infiltration into the soil 
surface and reduce soil erosion (Benavides-Solorio and MacDonald 2001, Johansen et al. 
2001).  Plant species selected for post-fire seeding treatments are most commonly annual 
cereal grains or sterile graminoid hybrids selected for quick growth and extensive fibrous 
roots (Robichaud et al. 2000).  Seeding with native species is encouraged but due to low 
availability of locally collected seed stock and high cost its use is limited (Richards et al. 
1998, Beschta et al. 2003).   
Post-wildfire seeding has been criticized for the potential of quick-growing 
seeded species to garner resources and reduce abundance of native plants (Beschta et al. 
2003, Keeley 2004).  Species with rapid growth, those selected for post-wildfire seeding, 
have the potential to out-compete and reduce abundance of slower growing species 
(Corbin and D’Antonio 2004).  Non-native cereal grains used in post-fire seeding use 
nutrient, water, and light resources at higher rates than native species, and may result in 
lower native species abundance (Keeley 2004, Hunter and Omi 2006).  Since post-fire 
seeding treatments are intended to promote long-term ecosystem rehabilitation, 
decreasing the abundance of long-lived native perennials and shrubs is of particular 
concern (Robichaud et al. 2000, Beyers 2004).   
Previous research indicates post-wildfire seeding can reduce species richness and 
abundance of some life-form groups such as annual and biennial forbs, shrubs, and 

87 
 
conifers which may have short and long-term ecological impacts (Schoennagel and 
Waller 1999, Kruse et al. 2004, Keeley 2004).  Annual and biennial forb species are often 
important contributors to post-fire plant communities and many are uniquely adapted to 
or dependent on post-fire conditions (Keeley 2004, Laughlin et al. 2004).  These pioneer 
species can provide rapid vegetative cover and thus contribute to reduced erosion and 
runoff after high-severity fires (Johansen et al. 2001, Laughlin et al. 2004).  Shrubs and 
conifers provide heterogeneity in root depth, soil stabilization, and long-term ecological 
rehabilitation following high-severity fires in forested ecosystems.  Also these longer 
lived species may serve the role of “foundation species” in many forested systems 
(Buonopane 2005, Leniere and Houle 2008).  Foundation species are those that have 
significant influence on ecosystem functioning and composition.  Significant reductions 
in these species could have negative long-term effects on ecosystem functioning and 
diversity (Leniere and Houle 2008). 
There is not a clear threshold at which the abundance of seeded species has 
negative effects on native plant communities.  Plant community ecology studies would 
predict low species richness and recruitment in an ecosystem with high dominance of a 
single species (Smith et al. 2004).  Based on the concept of high dominance, reduced 
species richness or a general reduction in plant abundance would be expected when 
seeded species occupied a large portion of the plant community.  In Beyers’ (2004) 
review she reported reduced post-fire native plant regeneration is consistently reported 
when seeded species result in >30% vegetative cover.  However, other studies have 
indicated reduced shrub, annual forb, and biennial forb abundance when seeded species 
had relatively low cover values but had high relative abundance in the plant community 

88 
 
(Schoennagel and Waller 1999, Barclay et al. 2004, Keeley 2004).  Thus, indicating the 
importance of both total vegetative cover and relative abundance of seeded species in 
predicting effects of seeding on plant communities.     
We seeded native and non-native species following two high-severity wildfires to 
determine the effects of seeding on plant community composition in the first and second 
years following fire.  We hypothesized that seeding would: 1) reduce total species 
richness, 2) significantly alter plant community composition, and that 3) these changes 
would persist into the second year following fire. 
Methods 
We established experimental plots on two wildfires that occurred in 2006: the 
Warm Fire in northern Arizona and the Potato Fire in central Arizona.  Both wildfires 
burned in early summer (June-July) in areas dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus 
ponderosa C. Lawson).  Data were collected in the first two years following fire.  The 
Warm Fire receives greater average annual precipitation (65 cm annual average) and is at 
a higher elevation (2400 m) than the Potato Fire, which receives an average annual 
precipitation of 52 cm and is at an elevation of 2100 m (Brewer et al. 1991, Laing et al. 
1991, WRCC 2009).   The Warm Fire is located on the Kaibab Plateau with soils 
developed from limestone parent material and the Potato Fire is near the southern most 
edge of the Colorado Plateau with soils developed from basalt parent material. 
 
We established 15 20- x 25-m (500-m2) plots per treatment at each fire in unseeded 
areas of high-severity burn, with slopes between 5 to 25%.  Treatments randomly 
assigned to plots included seeding with: 1) non-native common wheat (Triticum aestivum 
L.), 2) non-native annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum (Lam.) Husnot), 3) a native seed 

89 
 
mix including 43 % squirreltail (Elymus elymoides (Raf.) Swezey), 19.8% blue grama 
(Bouteloua gracilis (Willd. ex Kunth) Lag. ex Griffiths), 12.4% muttongrass (Poa 
fendleriana, (Steud.) Vasey), 12.4% scarlet gilia (Ipomopsis aggregata (Pursh) V.E. 
Grant), and 12.4% purple locoweed (Oxytropis lambertii, Pursh.), and 4) unseeded 
control.  Species used in seed mixes were selected because of their broad geographic 
distribution, have shown promising results in previous research, quick growth attributes, 
and their common use by land managers. (Robichaud et al. 2000, Elseroad et al. 2003, 
Springer and Laughlin 2004, Kuenzi et al. 2008).  Plant nomenclature and nativity are 
according to the Plants Database (USDA NRCS 2009).  Plant reference specimens are 
stored at the Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, 
Arizona.  Due to fire size, treatments varied between study sites.  At the Warm Fire all 
four treatments were tested and at the Potato Fire we applied all except the ryegrass 
treatment. Our target seeding rates were 403 pure live seeds (PLS)/m2.  This seeding rate 
is similar to those used in other post-fire seeding experiments (Robichaud et al. 2000, 
Thompson et al. 2006).      
Response Variables 
We estimated total plant canopy cover, litter, rock, and amount of bare ground, 
plus cover by life-form (graminoids, shrubs, and forbs) and by species in fifty, 20- X 50-
cm (0.1-m2) quadrats per plot.  In each plot, we placed the quadrats at 1-m intervals on 
the right side of 5 permanent transects.  We estimated cover by classes (1 = <1%, 2 = 1-
5%, 3 = 6-25%, 4 = 26-50%, 5 = 51-75%, 6 = 76-95%, 7 = 96-100%) modified from 
Daubenmire (1959).  We added the <1% class based on Bailey and Poulton’s (1968) 

90 
 
recommendation to better describe vegetation occurring in very small amounts from 0-1 
percent.  We used mid-points of each cover class to calculate averages. 
Analyses 
Due to differences in date of burn and variations in treatments applied we 
analyzed each fire as a separate case study. We used PERMANOVA, a distance-based 
nonparametric analysis of variance procedure that can be used with univariate or 
multivariate datasets, in PC-ORD V.5.1; all tests statistics were based on 9999 
permutations of the data (McCune and Mefford 1999, Anderson 2001).  When significant 
differences were detected among treatments we used pair-wise a posteriori t-test to 
separate means.  For all tests we used α = 0.05 to determine significance.  To determine if 
species richness differed among treatments we analyzed the average number of species in 
each plot in each year and each fire.   
To determine if plant community composition varied among treatments in both 
the first and second years following fire we used non-metric multidimensional scaling 
(NMDS) (Kruskal 1964) ordination and indicator species analysis (ISA) (Legendre and 
Legendre 1998).  We used NMDS ordinations to show the distribution of mean treatment 
composition in species space.  Ordinations were conducted using PC-ORD software (PC-
ORD V. 5.1), the parameters were set at 40 runs with real data, 50 runs with 
randomizations, a maximum of 400 iterations per run, and an instability criterion of 
0.00001 (McCune and Mefford 1999).  When a three dimensional solution was 
recommended we used the two axes that described the greatest amount of variation.  
Those axis scores were extracted and a mean value and standard errors were calculated 
per treatment type per year such that each point plotted in the resultant graph is the mean 

91 
 
location of that treatment (n=15) in species space based on ordination scores (Gundale et 
al. 2006).  We used Pearson’s correlation between species abundances and axes to 
determine which species are most strongly correlated with the ordination axis. 
 
We used indicator species analysis (ISA) to identify species most closely associated 
with each treatment (PC-ORD V.5.1 McCune and Mefford 1999).  ISA values were 
calculated for each species as relative frequency X percent canopy cover.  Species with p 
< 0.05 and an indicator value of >25 were identified as indicator species (Dufrene and 
Legendre 1997).   
To determine if compositional differences persisted into the second year, we used 
univariate analysis of variance, PERMANOVA, to analyze second year data by plant life-
form groups including:  total forbs, graminoids, and shrubs.  We also tested for changes 
in cover of individual species.  We analyzed cover of species that occurred at ~2% cover 
in at least two treatments plus cover of seeded species.  As forbs were the most abundant 
life-form we separated them into annual/biennial and perennial groups and analyzed these 
two groups separately using multivariate PERMANOVA.  Annual and biennial forbs are 
often fire followers in ponderosa pine forests and have been shown to be important in 
providing quick vegetative cover following disturbance, thus documenting the effects of 
seeding on this group is particularly important (Laughlin et al. 2004, Kuenzi et al. 2008) 
(Table 1).  
 
We used the Bray-Curtis distance measure for nonparametric analyses of variance 
and for NMDS procedures (Ludwig and Reynolds 1988, Faith et al. 1987).

RESULTS 
 
Does seeding alter species richness? 
We found no support for our hypothesis that seeding altered species richness in 
the first or second years following fire at either the Warm Fire or the Potato Fire (P = 
0.08, 0.19, 0.21, 0.22 respectively) (Table 1).  The majority of species recorded at both 
fires in both years were forbs with annual and biennial species accounting for 
approximately half of the forb total (Table 2).   
Does seeding alter plant community composition?     
Warm Fire   
Based on ordinations and indicator species analysis, seeding altered plant 
community composition in both the first and second years following fire (Table 3, Figure 
1A and B).  Unseeded plots, in both years following fire, were dominated by annual and 
biennial species.  These plots had no significant indicator species in the first year 
following fire but two annual forbs were indicators in the second.  The native seeded 
plots always had seeded plants as indicators.  Abundance of native seeded species on 
native treatments increased in the second year as did there dissimilarity with unseeded 
controls, based on ordinations.  In the first year following fire both the non-native seeded 
treatments were separated in ordination space from the unseeded controls and indicator 
species were the seeded non-natives, this trend continued into the second year at the 
ryegrass seeded plots but was ephemeral at the wheat seeded plots.   
The NMDS ordinations demonstrated spatial separation between plots in both 
years (Figure 1A and B).  This procedure for both the first and second year data set 
analysis recommended three dimensional solutions; we show the two axes that 

93 
 
represented the greatest variation in the distance matrix.  For the first year post-fire data, 
the three axes combined explained 72% of the variation (R2 axis 1 = 0.29, axis 2 = 0.25).  
Final stress was 17.69, final instability was >0.00001, the final solution was based on 208 
iterations.  Axis one, the X axis on the ordination graph, is most strongly positively 
correlated with ryegrass and negatively correlated with wheat.  Axis two, the Y axis on 
the ordination graph, is most strongly positively correlated with ryegrass and negatively 
correlated with two species in the native seed mix: squirreltail and scarlet gilia (Figure 1).  
The three axes for the second year post-fire ordination combined explained 82% of the 
variation (R2 axis 1(X) = 0.31, axis 2(Y) = 0.29).  Final stress was 16.34, final instability 
was >0.00001, the final solution was based on 303 iterations.  Axis one, the X axis on the 
ordination graph, is most strongly positively correlated with blue grama, a seeded native, 
and negatively correlated with ryegrass and a ruderal forb, spreading fleabane.  Axis two, 
the Y axis on the ordination graph, is most strongly positively correlated with a ruderal 
forb, running fleabane and negatively correlated with Wheeler’s thistle.  
Potato Fire 
          Similar to the Warm Fire composition based on ordinations and ISA was different 
among treatments in both the first and second years following fire (Table 3, Figure 1C 
and D).  Native treatments always had native seeded species as indicators but had greater 
separation in ordination space in the second year when seeded species were at higher 
cover values.  Wheat produced very low cover in the first year following fire and nearly 
disappeared in the second.   
In the first year following fire, annual and biennial forbs dominated the plant 
community and were most closely associated with the ordination axes.  In the second 

94 
 
year, seeded natives increased to >10% cover and were correlated with the ordination 
axes (Figure 1C and D).  The NMDS ordination recommended a three dimensional 
solution for both the first and second year data sets. The axes for the first year ordination 
represented 81% of the variation (R2 axis 1 = 0.33, axis 2 = 0.28).  Final stress was 14.02, 
final instability was <0.00001, and the final solution was based on 132 iterations.  Axis 
one was most strongly positively correlated with spreading fleabane, and negatively 
correlated with common mullein.  Axis two is most strongly positively correlated with 
three nerve goldenrod, Solidago velutina DC., and negatively correlated with a native 
graminoid, Cyperus fendlerianus (Boeckeler).  The three axes from the second year 
ordination explained 86% of the total variation (R2 axis 1 = 0.47, axis 3 = 0.23), final 
stress was 12.88, based on 114 iterations.  Species correlated with axis one were fetid 
goosefoot (positively) and blue grama (negatively); common mullein (positively) and 
ragleaf bahia (Bahia dissecta (A. Gray) Britton) (negatively) were correlated with axis 
two.   
Indicator species analysis identified seeded species as indicators of seeded 
treatments in the first and second years following fire (Table 5).  Indicator species for the 
native seeded plots in both years were two seeded grass species, squirreltail and blue 
grama.  These were the two native grasses seeded at the highest rate.  Indicator species at 
the wheat treatment changed from wheat in the first year to a native ruderal forb, 
fiddleleaf (Nama dichotomum (Ruiz and Pav.) Choisy), as wheat completely disappeared 
in the second year.  There were no significant indicators of unseeded plots in the first 
year following fire, but a ruderal forb, pygmy bluet (Houstonia wrightii A. Gray), was an 
indicator species in the second year. 

95 
 
Do plant community changes due to seeding persist into the second year following fire? 
When seeded species accounted for as little as 10% of total cover, the abundance 
of life-form groups was altered and included a significant increase in graminoids, a 
general but non-significant decrease in total forb abundance and a significant decrease in 
annual and biennial forbs compared to unseeded treatments (Table 4 and 5 Figure 2).   
Univariate analysis of second year vegetative cover by major life-form groups 
showed seeding significantly altered graminoid cover at both the Warm and Potato Fire 
as compared to unseeded controls (P = 0.005 and 0.04).  At both fires native seeded plots 
had higher graminoid cover compared to all other treatments. Total forb cover was lower 
on seeded plots where seeded species were >3% cover but did not vary significantly 
among treatments at either the Warm or Potato Fires (P = 0.59 and 0.08 respectively).  
Total shrub cover was only at trace amounts at the Potato Fire and at the Warm Fire total 
shrub cover did not vary significantly among treatments (P = 0.07).   
Multivariate analysis of the abundance of annual and biennial forbs showed 
significant differences among treatments at both fires in the second year following fire 
occurrence (Potato P = 0.03, Warm P = 0.04) (Table 6).  At the Warm Fire these forbs 
were significantly lower on wheat seeded treatments compared to both the native and 
unseeded treatments (P = 0.01, and 0.02).  At the Potato Fire these forbs were 
significantly lower on native seeded compared to unseeded treatments (P=0.01). 
Univariate analysis of abundant species and seeded species at the Warm Fire 
showed there was significantly lower cover of a perennial bunchgrass, (squirreltail) and a 
perennial forb (toadflax penstemon, Penstemon linariodies A. Gray) in both non-native 
seeding treatments as compared to unseeded treatments.  There was also significantly 

96 
 
greater cover of spreading fleabane (Erigeron divergens) in the wheat treatment as 
compared to unseeded controls.  A resprouting shrub (New Mexican locust, Robinia 
neomexicana A. Gray) was significantly lower on ryegrass seeded plots compared to 
unseeded treatments.  Native seeding resulted in significantly higher amounts of 
squirreltail and muttongrass compared to other treatments.  At the Potato Fire native 
seeding resulted in significantly lower amounts of a ruderal forb, fetid goosefoot 
(Chenopodium graveolens Willd.) and higher amounts of blue grama and bottlebrush 
squirreltail compared to both wheat and unseeded treatments. 
Discussion 
Does seeding reduce species richness? 
Contrary to our hypothesis, seeding did not reduce total species richness at either 
fire we studied.  A mechanism driving reduced species richness as a result of seeding 
likely includes high dominance by seeded species (Grime 2001, Smith et al. 2004).  
Smith et al. (2004) demonstrated lower species richness as a result of high dominance by 
one or a few species in the plant community.  We found relatively low dominance of 
seeded species; with no reduction in species richness compared to unseeded treatments.  
Post-fire seeding studies that have reported reduced species richness have also reported 
high cover values of seeded species, between 40-67%, and relatively high dominance of 
the seeded species (Conard et al. 1991, Amaranthus et al. 1993, Schoennagel and Waller 
1999, Keeley 2004).  However, recent reviews indicate it is rare for post-fire seeding 
treatments to achieve high cover, above 30% vegetative cover (Robichaud et al. 2000, 
Beyers 2004).  Thus, it may be more important to consider the effects of low cover values 
of seeded species on plant community richness.  A few studies have reported reduced 

97 
 
species richness when vegetative cover of seeded species is <30% and these studies 
generally reported low overall cover such that seeded species are, in relation to all 
species, relatively high in abundance in the post-fire environment (Ratzlaff and Anderson 
1995, Barclay et al. 2004).  This provides support for the concept that plant dominance, 
even at low total vegetative cover values, is important in determining species richness 
(Smith et al. 2004). 
Reducing species richness in post-fire plant communities may be a goal of some 
seeding treatments, as one of the stated purposes of seeding following fire is to reduce 
non-native species invasion (Robichaud et al. 2000, Beyers 2004, USDA 2004).  In 
contrast, reducing post-fire plant recruitment and species richness may contradict the goal 
of promoting ecosystem rehabilitation (Robichaud et al. 2000).  In forested ecosystems 
many perennial species are important for providing long-term soil stability. The high 
competitive environment resulting from successful seeding treatments has been shown to 
reduce conifer, shrub, and perennial grass and forb recruitment following fire 
(Schoennagel and Waller 1999, Keeley 2004).  Determining if reduced species richness is 
a desirable or undesirable outcome of seeding may depend on the abundance, diversity, 
and propagule pressure of non-natives in the local extant plant community (Sieg et al. 
2003). 
  Does seeding alter plant community composition? 
Plant communities were altered as a result of seeding with non-natives, based on 
our community analyses (NMDS and ISA); differences in composition were ephemeral 
on wheat seeding treatments but persistent on ryegrass treatments.  Altered plant 
communities as a result of ryegrass seeding have been commonly observed in post-

98 
 
wildfire seeding studies (Conard et al. 1991, Amaranthus et al. 1993, Barclay et al. 2004).  
Some researchers have suggested that ryegrass has allelopathic properties that negatively 
affect plant colonization (Cubbon 1925, Barclay et al. 2004).  Other research has 
suggested that the rapid utilization of nitrogen by ryegrass may reduce abundance of 
other species (Barclay et al. 2004).   
A foundation of the argument in favor of seeding with native species relies on the 
concept that seeded natives will promote native plants and disrupt native plant 
regeneration less than seeded non-native cereal grains (Richards et al. 1998, Beschta et al. 
2003).  We found seeded native species were consistently indicators of native seeded 
treatments and generally at higher levels in these treatments, although all seeded native 
species were also present in unseeded treatments.  Introducing seed of perennial grasses 
into the post-fire plant community moved community composition more quickly to a 
composition that is identified with later seral stages, that is, those with higher abundance 
of perennial grasses (Moore et al. 2006).  The risk of artificially increasing perennial 
grass species is that colonizing species will be excluded (Anderson and Brooks 1975).  
Colonizing species are important components of post-fire plant communities in forested 
ecosystems, in that they provide quick cover following fire and add to biological diversity 
(Keeley 2004, Laughlin et al. 2004).   
Do plant community changes due to seeding persist into the second year following fire? 
Our finding that annual and biennial forbs were significantly reduced as a result 
of seeding and this reduction persisted is important because this group of species can be 
important in establishing quick vegetative cover following fire (Crawford et al. 2001, 
Laughlin et al. 2004, Moore et al. 2006, Kuenzi et al. 2008).  Not all annual and biennial 

99 
 
forbs found in these plant communities increase following fire but, this grouping of 
species has been shown to be useful in documenting plant community changes following 
fire in ponderosa pine forests and is used here for that reason (Laughlin et al. 2004).  The 
reduction in annual and biennial forbs persisted into the second year following fire when 
the seeded species were as low as <3% cover.  This indicates that the result of impacting 
first year recruitment is longer term reductions of these species.  This is of particular 
concern as many fire-following forbs establish soil seedbanks in the first and second 
years after disturbance.  These seedbanks are important for vegetation recovery following 
future disturbance events (Wienk et al. 2004, Korb et al. 2005). 
Our finding that seeding reduced the abundance of perennials and one shrub 
species and that these reductions were persistent into the second year following fire 
indicates seeding may be contradictory to the long-term goals of ecosystem rehabilitation 
following fire.  The long-term intent of post-wildfire seed additions is to promote 
ecosystem regeneration and rehabilitation (Robichaud et al. 2000, Beyers 2004).  In many 
ecosystems, “foundation species,” are those that have a significant influence on 
ecosystem functioning and often include long lived species such as shrubs and perennial 
forbs and grasses (Buonopane 2005, Leniere and Houle 2008).  Reducing these species 
can have negative effects on long-term ecosystem development and composition (Elliot 
and White 1987, Amaranthus et al. 1993).  Previous research has indicated seeding with 
native and non-natives can result in reduced abundance of foundation species such as 
shrubs, conifers, and perennials (Amaranthus et al. 1993, Beyers 2004, Keeley 2004).

Conclusion 
Our study supported the hypothesis that seeding would alter plant community 
composition and these changes would persist for at least two years following fire.  The 
typical pattern of post-fire plant community development we documented included many 
species at low abundance values such that the reductions we documented at the species 
level, even when significant, were relatively small compared to total cover.  Reductions 
in annual and biennial forbs as a group were greater and may have long-term implications 
on the ability of native plants to establish quick vegetative cover following fire.  Longer 
term studies would help determine the significance of plant community changes resulting 
from seeding.  
The seeded natives produced only about one third of the cover that seeded non-
natives did in the first year following fire.  This shifted in the second year where non-
natives either were not persistent or decreased to approximately 5% cover and seeded 
natives accounted for approximately 10% cover.  This lag time in native seeded species 
establishment is well documented in other prescribed fire and forest restoration studies 
(Springer and Laughlin 2004, Daniels et al. 2008).  Since the risk of erosion is highest in 
the first growing season following fire (Robichaud et al. 2006, Wagenbrenner et al. 
2006), native perennial grasses tested in this study appear to be poorly suited for post-
wildfire seeding treatments. 
The intent of post-fire seeding is to promote quick vegetative cover following fire 
and is predicated on the assumption that natural regeneration will be insufficient to 
protect soils (Robichaud et al. 2000).  However, the difference in total vegetative cover 
among treatments we documented was small in both years (13% in the first year and 8% 

101 
 
in the second).  This study provided two experimental examples that seeding following 
wildfires does little to increase vegetative cover and alters plant community composition 
for at least two years following fire.  This study adds to the growing evidence that 
seeding following high-severity wildfires does little to achieve management goals.

CHAPTER 5 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
U.S. federal land managers are directed to evaluate conditions that exist following 
high-severity wildfires that occur on public land (Robichaud et al. 2000, USDA 2004).  
These managers evaluate the risk of erosion and non-native species invasion and when it 
is determined to be great recommend treatments to ameliorate these threats.  These 
actions are presently conducted through the Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation 
(BAER) program which in the last two decades spent over 48 million dollars on post-fire 
rehabilitation projects (Robichaud et al. 2000).  Wolfson et al. (2008) estimated the 
BAER program spent 6 million dollars in Arizona and New Mexico over a recent two 
year period.  BAER teams have a set of actions they commonly recommend, with seeding 
being the most widely utilized action (Robichaud et al. 2000, USDA 2004).  This present 
study and several preceding it (e.g., Schoennagel and Waller 1999, Kruse et al. 2004) 
evaluated the effects and effectiveness of post-fire seeding   
Using total vegetative cover as a metric of success for seeding treatments, few 
studies indicate seeding following fires increases area covered by vegetation in the first 
growing season following fire (Robichaud et al. 2000, Keeley 2004).  My study clearly 
demonstrates the lack of effectiveness of these treatments in increasing vegetative cover 
following fire.  My results support findings of two recent reviews that examined data 
from published reports and from internal agency monitoring reports that note it is rare for 
post-fire seeding treatments to result in over 30% vegetative cover in the first growing 
season following fire (Robichaud et al. 2000, Beyers 2004). 

117 
 
A primary goal of post-fire seeding treatments is to reduce non-native species 
invasion (Robichaud et al. 2000, USDA 2004).  I found no support for the notion that 
post-fire seeding reduces abundance or richness of non-native species.  At two of my 
study sites I did record relatively high levels of common mullein (Verbascum thapsus 
(L.) and at one site found Kentecky bluegrass (Poa pratensis (L.)) and Canadian 
bluegrass (Poa compressa (L.)) to be prevalent.  Mullein has a persistent seed bank >200 
years and will likely persist at some levels in the plant community of northern Arizona 
regardless of post wildfire seeding treatments.  The non-native grasses I recorded are 
likely a legacy of past intentional introductions (Fowler et al. 2009).  These rhizomatous 
grasses are also difficult to remove from the plant community and may become a 
naturalized component of this system. 
Seeding treatments, even at low cover values, may have persistent effects on the 
plant community.  It was notable that plant community composition was altered when 
first year seeded species cover was below 30%.  The observation of greater change in 
ryegrass seeded plots adds to previous research indicating this species may have lasting 
affects on plant community regeneration (Conard et al. 1991, Barclay et al. 2004).  
Seeded natives continued to increase in vegetative cover in the second year but never 
produced high amounts of cover, relative to the total cover.  Whether seeding with 
natives results in communities that are reflective of a later seral stage or represent a 
significant alteration to plant community composition will require further study.  Wheat 
(Triticum aestivum (L.)) produced similar cover values as ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum 
(L.)) but appeared to have less of an impact on the plant community and almost 
completely disappeared in the second year post-burn.  This reduction indicates that wheat 

118 
 
may have the least impact to plant communities, although studies that documented high 
levels of wheat cover found the persistent thatch layer inhibited plant community 
regeneration (Keeley 2004).   
Although not quantified in my study, it appears that ungulate grazers, such as 
cattle and elk (Cervus elaphus), may be utilizing vegetation in burned areas in the first 
and second years following fire.  At two of my study sites, Potato and Birdie Fires, cattle 
and elk and their signs were prevalent on all study plots.  Plants on study plots had 
obvious signs of damage from grazing.  Other researchers have warned of the negative 
effects of introducing grazing animals following fire (Beschta et al. 2003).  The affect of 
ungulate grazers on post-fire plant community deserves further research. 
Results from this study strongly indicate the ineffectiveness of post-fire seeding to 
achieve management goals and supports previous research that indicates potential 
negative impacts to plant communities as a result of post-fire seeding (Schoennagel and 
Waller 1999, Beyers 2004, Keeley 2004).  Seeding following fires has been shown to be 
an expensive action that yields minimal results (Robichaud et al. 2000).  Contour felling 
of logs following high-severity burns has been shown to have at least limited 
effectiveness at reducing hill slope erosion and warrants further research (Wagenbrenner 
et al. 2006).  Post-fire mulch additions have also been shown to be effective; however, 
there is a major concern of non-native species introductions as a result of mulching and 
further research into this aspect would be useful (Kruse et al. 2004).  Based on my results 
from three well replicated case studies, seeding does not achieve management goals of 
increasing vegetative cover or reducing non-native species invasions, and contrary to 

119 
 
management goals, negatively impacts native plant regeneration.  Managers should 
consider alternative actions when treating high-severity burn areas.
