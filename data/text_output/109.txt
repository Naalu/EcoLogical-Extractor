Abstract.
Restoration practice suggests that neighbor control is essential in semiarid
grasslands, but ecological theory predicts that neighbor effects are relatively small in young
ﬁelds. We investigated the effectiveness of neighbor control (mowing and herbicide) for
establishing native grasses in a recently abandoned ﬁeld in southwestern Saskatchewan,
Canada. We also examined its interactions with common restoration techniques, such as
mulching (straw and sawdust) and contrasting sowing methods (drilling, and broadcasting
cleaned seeds, cleaning remainders, and native hay). The experiment was repeated over
three years to examine the effect of weather. Neighbor control had no effect on establishment
and rarely any effect on ﬁrst-year survival. This contrasted with signiﬁcant effects of
neighbor control on community and ecosystem-level variables (species richness, water, N).
The lack of neighbor effects is concordant with theory which predicts low competition
intensity from ruderal annuals. Establishment in seeded plots varied two-fold among years
in drilled plots and 50-fold in broadcast plots, and it was lowest during a cool, dry summer.
Thus, variables beyond human control are a major factor determining restoration success.
Overall, broadcasting was as effective as drilling. The highest long-term establishment of
native species was produced by broadcasting cleaning remainders. Almost no seedlings
emerged from plots supplied with native hay. Straw mulch increased soil moisture and
available N, and sawdust decreased N, but neither had any long-term effect on native grasses.
Our results suggest that restorations of semiarid old ﬁelds should focus less on neighbor
control and more on strategies for exploiting suitable years for germination, either by
monitoring soil moisture or through repeated seeding.

INTRODUCTION
An axiom of grassland restoration is that neighboring
vegetation must be controlled to allow the establish-
ment of native grasses. This assertion appears to be
well supported in the case of introduced perennial
neighbors (Jordan 1988, Roundy and Call 1988, Wilson
and Gerry 1995, Bakker et al. 1997, 2003), which have
been called the greatest challenge to restoration success
(Duebbert et al. 1981). The case for annual neighbors
dominating early successional old ﬁelds, however, may
be different. Basic ecological theory (Grime 1979) pre-
dicts that the intensity of competition increases with
ﬁeld age. Competitive effects on grass seedlings are

modest in young ﬁelds (Wilson 1999). Annual com-
panion crops typically have little effect on the perfor-
mance of agricultural perennials such as alfalfa (Wad-
dington and Malik 1987), and early successional an-
nuals disappeared from a tallgrass prairie restoration
after three years (Baer et al. 2003). Neighbor control
by hand weeding or dicot-speciﬁc herbicides signiﬁ-
cantly improved perennial grass establishment in two
restorations (Cox and McCarty 1958, Bovey et al.
1986). In a two-year experiment, however, the beneﬁt
of controlling annual neighbors disappeared by the sec-
ond growing season (King et al. 1989). In another
study, neighbor control improved the establishment of
one native grass (Andropogon gerardii) but not another
(Calamovilfa longifolia, Masters et al. 1990). Thus,
theory and measurements of competition intensity sug-
gest that neighbor control in annual neighborhoods will
have little positive effect, but restoration studies pro-
vide mixed results. Here we report the results of a four-
year experiment designed to test the inﬂuence of neigh-
bor control on native grass establishment and survi-
vorship in a semiarid old ﬁeld. We also examined how
the effectiveness of neighbor control varied with other
common restoration techniques, such as seeding meth-
od, native hay addition, and mulching.

SEMIARID OLD-FIELD RESTORATION
There is considerable discussion about the best meth-
od of sowing seeds in semiarid restorations. Manage-
ment guidelines favor drilling over broadcasting (Hy-
der et al. 1975), but reviews show that each method is
superior in certain cases (Duebbert et al. 1981, Wilson
2002), with the advantage over the long term varying
among years (Newman and Redente 2001, Bakker et
al. 2003). Survivorship, however, in one semi-arid res-
toration was consistently higher in broadcast than
drilled plots (Bakker et al. 2003), probably because
seedlings in drilled plots were crowded into lines and
suffered more intense intraspeciﬁc competition. Broad-
casting also allows the emergence of plant-induced het-
erogeneity within the community (Cofﬁn et al. 1996).
Our second objective was to compare the effects of
drilling and broadcasting on establishment and survi-
vorship of native grass seedlings.
Any seed mix is unlikely to represent the full di-
versity and composition of the natural seed rain, and
will also lack other parts of the community such as
insects, fungi, and monerans. This problem could be
overcome by adding native hay instead of cleaned seeds
(Bakker and Berendse 1999). Native hay has received
little attention relative to using cleaned seeds (Wilson
2002), so our third goal was to examine the effective-
ness of native hay addition.
Another widespread practice that has produced
mixed results is the use of mulch. Mulch may promote
restoration by increasing soil moisture and seedling
establishment (Jacoby 1969). Mulch may also serve as
a carbon source for bacteria, allowing them to immo-
bilize nutrients such as nitrogen, and more quickly re-
turn disturbed, nutrient-rich soil to predisturbance con-
ditions with lower nutrient availability (Wilson and
Gerry 1995, Morghan and Seastedt 1999, To¨ro¨k et al.
2000, Baer et al. 2003). Our fourth objective was to
test the ability of mulch to promote restoration.
Lastly, the great among-year variability of rainfall
in semiarid ecosystems (Knapp and Smith 2001) sug-
gests that restoration success will vary among years.
For example the establishment of native seedlings from
seed sown at the same density for three years in south-
ern Saskatchewan varied four-fold among years (Bak-
ker et al. 2003). The establishment of the dominant
grass Bouteloua gracilis is especially sensitive to
drought because of its dependence on adventitious
roots (Wilson and Briske 1979a, b). As a result some
years will be more suitable for restoration than others,
echoing Westoby et al.’s (1989) call for grassland man-
agers to exploit temporal windows of opportunity. Var-
iable rainfall creates other restoration problems: pre-
cipitation in our region occurs primarily as storms
(James et al. 2003), resulting in runoff and erosion, and
the sensitivity of grassland productivity to precipitation
(Sala et al. 1988) results in variable and unreliable
production of seeds among years. The last of our goals
was to examine among-year variation in establishment
and survival, and to explore whether the efﬁcacy of
other practices, such as neighbor control, seeding meth-
od, and mulch, also varied among years.
In summary, we examined the inﬂuence of neighbor
control, seeding method, and mulch on the establish-
ment and survival of native grass seedlings in each of
three years in an early successional semiarid old ﬁeld.
METHODS
We worked in Grasslands National Park (498119 N,
1078439 W), about 140 km south of Swift Current, Sas-
katchewan, Canada. The natural vegetation of the re-
gion is mixed-grass prairie dominated by blue grama
(Bouteloua gracilis), needle-and-thread grass (Stipa
comata), and spikemoss (Selaginella densa; Christian
and Wilson 1999). Long-term (30-year) weather data
from the nearest meteorological station (Val Marie, 10
km southeast; Environment Canada, unpublished data)
showed that annual precipitation was 313 mm, with
almost half falling during May–July. Mean monthly
temperatures range from 2138C in January to 198C in
July. During our study, temperature during the peak of
seedling establishment (May–July) was signiﬁcantly (P
, 0.05, t tests) higher in 1994 (15.88C) and 1997
(16.08C) than the 30-year mean (15.08C). Total precip-
itation during May–July was signiﬁcantly different
from the 30-year mean (149 mm) in 1995, 1996, and
1997 (212, 128, and 78 mm, respectively).
Our ﬁeld (78 ha, Appendix A) was dominated by the
annuals Kochia scoparia, Erigeron canadensis, and
Lactuca scariola at the start of the study. The ﬁeld
faces north with a 58 slope and has chernozemic loam
to clay loam soils (Agriculture Canada 1992). Aerial
photographs show that it was under cultivation in 1955
and in 1982 (M. Hansen, personal communication), and
it was presumably cultivated during that period. Cul-
tivation stopped about 1984 (K. Foster, personal com-
munication).
Experimental design
We established 240 plots (each 3 3 10 m, separated
by 1-m corridors) and one-third of them were randomly
assigned to each of three seeding years (1994, 1995,
1996) to examine the effect of seeding year on resto-
ration success. Plots were sampled for dependent var-
iables during the year they were seeded and annually
thereafter until 1997.
The experiment was a complete factorial design with
seeding method (none, broadcast, drilled, native hay),
and neighbor control (applied or not) as main factors,
for a total of eight treatment combinations in each of
three years. Each treatment combination was randomly
assigned to each of ten replicate plots in 1995 and 1996.
In 1994 there were ﬁve replicates of each treatment,
and another ﬁve replicates of each treatment were as-
signed to an additional treatment (mulch).
Seeding times (late May), rates, and mixes (Table 1)
were identical for broadcast and drilled plots. The seed
mix was dominated by Bouteloua gracilis, reﬂecting

its relative abundance in native vegetation (Christian
and Wilson 1999). Other species varied in abundance
among years according to the availability of seed, so
the total number of seeds varied among years (Table
1). The only species that germinated in any numbers,
however, was B. gracils (see Results), which was sown
at identical rates among years. Seed was obtained from
the closest commercial source (Enviroscapes, Leth-
bridge, Alberta, Canada) and had been collected the
year before. Plots broadcast with seed were lightly
tilled immediately before broadcasting to improve con-
tact between seed and soil. Seed was drilled 1 cm deep
in rows 30 cm apart.
Native hay was collected from undisturbed prairie a
few km from the site using a rear-bagging lawn mower
and applied at 200 g/m2, an amount similar to the av-
erage standing crop of native grassland. Hay gathered
in August 1994 was immediately scattered on plots
designated to be seeded in 1995, and hay gathered in
August 1995 was immediately scattered on plots des-
ignated to be seeded in 1996. This allowed seed strat-
iﬁcation in situ and snow melt to bring the hay into
contact with the soil, ensuring that seeds in hay would
be in place for germination in the appropriate year.
Native hay was unavailable in 1994, the ﬁrst year of
the experiment, so cleaning remainders were scattered
at 180 g/m2, the highest rate possible with the amount
of remainders available. Cleaning remainders com-
prised material remaining after native hay was pro-
cessed to collect seed of Stipa comata, and were ex-
pected to be rich in seeds of other prairie species.
Plots receiving neighbor control were treated each
year, starting in the year they were seeded. In 1994,
plots were mowed in June and again in July. Biomass
was removed from the plots. In subsequent years plots
were sprayed with herbicide. We switched from mow-
ing to herbicide because preliminary analyses showed
that mowing had no effect on unwanted species or on
native seedling establishment (Christian 1996) and we
wanted to know whether herbicide was effective. We
sprayed Killex (95 g/L 2,4-D, 50 g/L mecoprop (d-
isomer), 9 g/L dicamba), a dicot-speciﬁc herbicide, at
27 L/ha in July 1995, and 12 L/ha in June 1996 and
1997. Almost all unwanted species at the start of the
study were dicots. We used high rates in 1995 to ensure
control, and lower rates in later years after we observed
effective control in 1995. Thus, control methods varied
among years, allowing us to compare treated and con-
trol plots in each year, but not allowing direct com-
parisons of control methods.
Mulch was an additional factor applied as a main
effect in the 1994 seeding year, and as a split-plot factor
in the 1996 seeding year. In May 1994, a 1:16 mix of
ﬂax and wheat straw was shredded and spread at 200
g/m2. In May 1995, an additional 400 g/m2 of shredded
wheat straw was applied to 2 3 2-m subplots within
the plots mulched in 1994. Mulch type varied according
to availability. Following the second mulch applica-
tion, all subsequent measurements of dependent vari-
ables were taken from within the subplots. In May
1996, sawdust (from white spruce, Picea glauca) was
applied at 1000 g/m2 to 3 3 5-m subplots in plots
broadcast with seed and treated with herbicide starting
in 1996. Sawdust was spread prior to tilling and broad-
casting. The quantity and C:N ratio of mulch were in-
creased over time because initial results showed little
effect.
In each of the three years in which seeds were sown,
we counted seedlings in late June to determine estab-
lishment and in August of the same year to determine
survivorship. Seedlings were counted within transects
(3 m long) running across plots. Transect numbers and
widths varied with seedling density, between three 20
cm wide transects in cases where seedlings were sparse,
and ﬁve 5 cm wide transects where seedlings were
abundant. In all cases density was expressed on a
square-meter basis. Long-term seedling changes in
plots seeded in 1994 and 1995 were followed by annual
sampling in June and August until 1997.
Species composition was assessed annually in Au-
gust in three quadrats (0.5 3 1 m) along the diagonal
of each plot. The proportion of each quadrat occupied
by each species was determined using Daubenmire’s
(1959) scale, with the use of an additional class (0–
1%).
Standing crop was sampled annually in August in
three quadrats (0.1 3 1 m) arrayed along the diagonal
of each plot. Samples from each plot were pooled and
frozen until drying and weighing. Root mass was sam-
pled annually in two soil cores (2 cm diameter, 10 cm

deep) per quadrat. Root samples from each plot were
pooled and frozen until washing, drying, and weighing.
We washed roots by hand using a sieve and running
water. All roots were collected, and leaves and stems
were discarded.
Soil moisture and available N (sum of ammonium
and nitrate) were sampled annually in May and August.
Five soil cores (2 cm diameter, 10 cm deep) were taken
from each plot, one near each corner and one from the
center, and pooled. Gravimetric soil moisture was cal-
culated by weighing a subsample, drying it to constant
mass, and reweighing it. Soil moisture was calculated
as a percentage of wet mass. Available N was extracted
using a 0.02 M KCl solution. The KCl solution was
then decanted and frozen until analysis with an ion-
selective electrode (Orion, Boston, Massachusetts,
USA).
Proportional data were square-root or arcsine square-
root transformed prior to analysis, and other data were
log transformed. For each year we performed a two-
way ANOVA with seeding method and herbicide as
main effects. For analysis of establishment and sur-
vivorship, we included only two seeding methods
(broadcast and drilling) in ANOVAs because the other
two methods (unseeded controls and native hay) pro-
duced almost no seedlings. Including the latter methods
would violate the assumptions of ANOVA because al-
most all the values were 0, which precludes the estimate
of variance needed for the analysis.
Plots seeded in 1994 had a third treatment, straw
mulch, included as a main effect in the analysis. Saw-
dust mulch was applied in 1996 to subplots in plots
that were broadcast seeded and treated with herbicide;
the effect of sawdust was tested by comparing mulched
and unmulched subplots in the same plots using one-
way ANOVA. Statistical analyses were conducted us-
ing JMP (version 3.0.2, SAS Institute, Cary, North Car-
olina, USA) and NCSS (version 6.0.22, NCSS, Kays-
ville, Utah, USA) software.
Results for establishment are from June of the seed-
ing year, and results for survivorship are from August
of the same year. Results for other variables (species
covers and richness, standing crop, soil moisture, avail-
able nitrogen) are reported from the end of the second
growing season after seeding, as this was the longest
time span common to all three seeding years.
RESULTS
Establishment and survival
Seedlings of all species sown were found, but we
considered all species together because almost all were
Bouteloua gracilis (e.g., 99% in 1994). The seeding
rate for all species combined varied among years, but
because almost all established individuals were B.
gracilis, which was sown at the same rate each year
(Table 1), among-year comparisons are possible. In
general, seedlings of native species were found only
in plots supplied with seeds by broadcasting or drilling.
The maximum density of native seedlings in plots not
supplied with seeds was ,1 seedling/m2.
Establishment did not vary signiﬁcantly (P , 0.05)
with neighbor control, either as a main effect or as an
interaction with another factor, in any year (Appendix
B). Establishment was signiﬁcantly higher in broadcast
than drilled plots sown in 1994, but signiﬁcantly higher
in drilled than broadcast plots in 1995 and 1996 (Fig.
1a, Appendix B). Differences between broadcasting
and drilling in their effects on establishment persisted
for at least three years: plots sown in 1994 continued
to have a higher mean density of native seedlings in
the broadcast treatment, whereas plots sown in 1995
continued to have higher densities in the drilled treat-
ment (Fig. 2).

on every sampling date.

(b) species richness in untreated plots (open bars) and plots
in which neighbors were controlled for two growing seasons
(shaded bars). Asterisks indicate signiﬁcant differences (P ,

Establishment did not vary signiﬁcantly with mulch
in any year (Appendix B). Establishment varied greatly
among years, 50-fold in broadcast plots and two-fold
in drilled plots (Fig. 1a). Establishment was lowest in
1996, the coolest and driest of the three years (Fig. 1a).
Survivorship was not affected by neighbor control
in plots sown in 1994 or 1995, but neighbor control
signiﬁcantly improved survivorship in 1996 plots (Ap-
pendix B). A signiﬁcant interaction between seeding
method and neighbor control occurred because neigh-
bor control signiﬁcantly increased survivorship in
broadcast plots (no control, 0.14%; control, 2.22%) but
not in drilled plots (no control, 0.37%; control, 0.31%).
Survivorship did not vary signiﬁcantly between
seeding treatments in 1994 or 1995, but was signiﬁ-
cantly higher in broadcast than drilled plots in 1996
(Fig. 1b, Appendix B). Mulch had no main effect on
survivorship in any year, but in 1994 plots there was
a signiﬁcant interaction between mulch and seed meth-
od because mulch increased survivorship in broadcast
plots (no mulch, 32.3%; mulch, 69.5%) but decreased
survivorship in drilled plots (no mulch, 62.9%; mulch,
37.9%).
Cleaning remainders produced the highest densities
of native grasses. The addition of remainders in 1994
produced higher densities four years after seeding (68
seedlings/m2 averaged over other treatments) than ei-
ther broadcasting (33 seedlings/m2) or drilling (15
seedlings/m2). In contrast, the maximum density of na-
tive seedlings in plots supplied with native hay in 1995
and 1996 was ,1 seedling/m2.
Species composition
The total cover of nonnative species at the end of
the second growing season (the longest period with data
available for all three planting years) was reduced by
neighbor control every year, but signiﬁcantly so only
in plots seeded in 1994 and 1995 (Fig. 3a, Appendix
C). The cover of nonnative species did not vary sig-
niﬁcantly with any other factor in any year (Appendix
C).
The total cover of native species at the end of the
second growing season was not affected signiﬁcantly
by neighbor control for any planting year (Appendix
C). Native species cover was signiﬁcantly increased by
seed addition in plots sown in 1994 and 1995 (Appen-
dix C, data not shown). In 1994 plots, broadcast plots
had signiﬁcantly higher cover of native species than
did unseeded plots, and drilled plots were intermediate.
In 1995 plots, however, native cover was signiﬁcantly
higher in drilled plots, and did not vary between un-
seeded and broadcast plots. Native cover was not af-
fected signiﬁcantly by mulch (Appendix C).
Annual monitoring of untreated plots established in
1994 revealed that the total cover of annuals dropped

sharply after the ﬁrst year of the experiment as species
such as Kochia scoparia and Erigeron canadensis de-
clined. Perennials, mostly alien species such Taraxa-
cum ofﬁcinale, increased steadily. The nonnative pe-
rennial grass Agropyron cristatum accounted for almost
25% of the total cover by 1997.
Species richness at the end of the second growing
season was decreased signiﬁcantly by neighbor control
each year (Fig. 3b, Appendix C). Richness was in-
creased, however, by seed addition each year (Appen-
dix C, data not shown). Richness did not vary with any
other factor or interaction.
Standing crop and roots
Standing crop at the end of the second growing sea-
son was reduced by neighbor control only in plots sown
in 1994 (Appendix D). Examination of each year’s data,
however, revealed that the effect of neighbor control
on standing crop changed from signiﬁcantly negative
to signiﬁcantly positive over the period 1994–1997 (F
values for the effect of neighbor control for each year:
118.08, 34.14, 0.77, 4.25 [df for each year were 1 and
48]; data not shown). The same pattern was found for
plots sown in 1995, the other planting year for which
at least three years of data were available. Standing
crop was not affected by mulch in any year (Appendix
D).
Seeding method did not affect standing crop for plots
seeded in 1995, but had signiﬁcant and opposite effects
on plots seeded in 1994 and 1996. In 1994 plots, stand-
ing crop was signiﬁcantly lower in broadcast (44.1
g/m2; Appendix D) than drilled plots (87.2 g/m2), and
control plots were intermediate between these two
treatments (72.4 g/m2). In 1996 plots, standing crop
was signiﬁcantly higher in broadcast (99.9 g/m2) than
either drilled (93.8 g/m2) or control plots (90.0 g/m2).
Root mass in plots seeded in 1994 (at the end of the
second growing season) was signiﬁcantly decreased by
neighbor control (no control, 668.9 g/m2; control, 540.1
g/m2) and mulch (unmulched, 668.6 g/m2; mulched,
540.4 g/m2; Appendix D), but was unaffected by seed-
ing. Root mass in plots seeded in 1995 did not vary
with any factor. Plots started in 1996 had root mass
signiﬁcantly increased by seeding (unseeded, 682.0
g/m2; broadcast, 989.2 g/m2; drilled, 706.7 g/m2; Ap-
pendix D).
Soil resources
Soil moisture at the end of the second growing sea-
son in plots sown in 1994 was increased signiﬁcantly
by both neighbor control and straw mulch (Appendix
E). A signiﬁcant interaction occurred between these
factors because neighbor control signiﬁcantly increased
soil moisture in mulched plots (no control, 13.0%; con-
trol, 16.5%), but not in plots without mulch (no control,
12.9%; control, 13.8%). In other words, neither neigh-
bor control or mulch alone inﬂuenced soil moisture,
but both working together increased moisture signiﬁ-
cantly. Soil moisture in 1994 plots was unaffected by
seeding (Appendix E).
Soil moisture in plots sown in 1995 and 1996 was
unaffected by neighbor control and mulch, but varied
signiﬁcantly among seeding methods (Appendix E).
Pairwise comparisons showed that, for plots sown in
1995, soil moisture was signiﬁcantly lower in both
broadcast (5.8%) and drilled (5.9%) plots than in con-
trol plots (6.5%). In plots sown in 1996, soil moisture
was signiﬁcantly lower in broadcast (5.2%) than con-
trol plots (6.2%), and drilled plots were intermediate
between these two treatments (5.8%).
Available N at the end of the second growing season
was signiﬁcantly increased by neighbor control for
plots sown in 1994 (no control, 0.63 mg N/kg soil;
control, 2.47 mg N/kg soil) and 1995 (no control, 1.24
mg N/kg soil; control, 2.43 mg N/kg soil; Appendix
E), but not for plots sown in 1996.
Straw mulch slightly but signiﬁcantly increased
available N (Appendix E; unmulched, 1.17 mg N/kg
soil; mulched, 1.38 mg N/kg soil, averaged across other
treatments in plots sown in 1994). In contrast, sawdust
mulch signiﬁcantly decreased N (unmulched, 2.85 mg
N/kg soil; mulched, 1.53 mg N/kg soil; Appendix E).
Available N varied among seeding treatments only
for 1996 plots. Pairwise comparisons showed that N
was signiﬁcantly higher in broadcast plots (2.45 mg
N/kg soil) than in drilled (1.12 mg N/kg soil) or control
plots (0.94 mg N/kg soil; Appendix E).
DISCUSSION
Neighbor control had no effect on establishment in
any of the three years examined. Further, there were
no signiﬁcant interactions between neighbor control
and other experimental factors (Appendix B). The sim-
ilarity of results among years and the absence of in-
teractions suggest that the absence of control effects
can be expected to vary little with environment. Sim-
ilarly, neighbor control had no effect on survivorship,
except for a very small improvement in one seeding
treatment in one year.
A lack of response to neighbor control was not
caused by failure to suppress neighbors: the cover of
nonnative species was decreased by neighbor control
in every year (Fig. 3). Standing crop and root mass
were signiﬁcantly reduced by neighbor control in 1994
plots, soil moisture and available nitrogen were sig-
niﬁcantly increased by neighbor control in 1994 plots,
and available nitrogen was also increased by neighbor
control in 1995 plots. Species richness was signiﬁ-
cantly reduced by neighbor control in every year (Fig.
3), reﬂecting the loss of weedy species from the veg-
etation.
The reason for the difference between establishment
and vegetation responses to neighbor control probably
lies in timing. Both mowing in 1994 and spraying her-
bicide in 1995 and 1996 affected established annuals.
These individuals may already have exerted some com-

petitive suppression on the sown native grasses, so
treating them after establishment had little beneﬁt. Pre-
emergence control, which suppresses weed seedling es-
tablishment, is widely used in agriculture (Vleeshou-
wers and Kropff 2000), and might be effective in res-
toration. On the other hand, our results are consistent
with increasing competition intensity with ﬁeld age
(Wilson 1999). Other prairie restoration experiments
in early successional ﬁelds have also found mixed re-
sults from neighbor control on establishment success
(Cox and McCarty 1958, McGinnies 1968, Masters et
al. 1990).
Control methods varied among years as we attempted
to ﬁnd effective controls. This does not inﬂuence our
interpretation of the results, however, because neighbor
control did not affect establishment in any year.
In contrast to neighbors having small effects in early-
successional annual neighborhoods, established stands
of introduced perennial grasses are among the greatest
obstacles to prairie restoration (Jordan 1988, Roundy
and Call 1988, Wilson 2002), and neighbor control con-
sistently improved establishment and survivorship in a
simultaneous study about 10 km away in which native
grass seeds were sown into stands of the perennial in-
troduced grass Agropyron cristatum (Bakker et al.
2003).
The results for mulch were similar to those for neigh-
bor control in that mulch had no signiﬁcant effect on
establishment or survivorship, in spite of several sig-
niﬁcant effects on ecosystem-level variables. Straw
mulch applied in 1994 increased soil moisture in plots
in which neighbors were controlled, and also increased
available N. This may reﬂect higher rates of mineral-
ization caused by increased soil moisture. In contrast,
sawdust mulch applied in 1996 decreased available N.
Differences between years in available N in control
plots presumably reﬂect among-year variation in cli-
mate. Sawdust mulch had no signiﬁcant effect in the
nearby A. cristatum stand (Bakker et al. 2003), but did
signiﬁcantly reduce N availability in other restorations
(Wilson and Gerry 1995, Morghan and Seastedt 1999,
Baer et al. 2003).
Variation in establishment among years was far
greater than variation between neighbor control treat-
ments (Table 1), reﬂecting the sensitivity of B. gracilis
to moisture (Wilson and Briske 1979b). Establishment
in drilled plots varied two-fold among years, whereas
establishment in broadcast plots varied 50-fold. The
difference between drilled and broadcast plots in the
magnitude of variation among years presumably re-
ﬂects the ability of drilling to buffer seeds from short-
term variation in temperature and moisture. Regardless
of seeding method, the results suggest that restoration
resources would be more wisely allocated to repeated
seeding among years, as opposed to controlling an-
nuals.
Drilling was signiﬁcantly better than broadcasting
for establishment in two years, but broadcasting was
signiﬁcantly better in one year, and for survivorship in
another year (Fig. 1). High survivorship in broadcast
plots in 1996 was actually net recruitment (survivor-
ship .100%) between June and August. Each method
produced the highest cover of native grasses and stand-
ing crop in different years, and both increased species
richness. Overall, therefore, neither method was dis-
tinctly advantageous, echoing results from the nearby
A. cristatum stand (Bakker et al. 2003). Differences
among years in the success of drilling and broadcasting
persisted through the course of the experiment (Fig.
2), echoing results from Colorado, where initial dif-
ferences among establishment techniques persisted for
20 years (Newman and Redente 2001). Thus, the choice
to drill rather than broadcast seed is likely to create
long-lived rows of grasses which impose unnatural spa-
tial structure on the community (Looman and Heinrichs
1973). This can be avoided by broadcasting seed.
Seed-cleaning remainders scattered in plots pro-
duced the highest density of native seedlings, as oc-
curred elsewhere (Bakker et al. 2003). Remainders are
normally discarded, but they are clearly a valuable res-
toration resource. Their success also reinforces the no-
tion that broadcasting can produce successful estab-
lishment. The lack of seedlings produced by spreading
native hay suggests that this method might be best re-
served for years of unusually high seed production.
The effects of herbicide on standing crop reversed
over the course of the experiment: herbicide signiﬁ-
cantly decreased standing crop in 1995, had no effect
in 1996, and signiﬁcantly increased it in 1997, for plots
sown in both 1994 and 1995. Dicot-selective herbicide
killed dicots and reduced standing crop in 1995, but
the results suggest that the effect of killing dicots in
1997 was to release perennial graminoids from com-
petition. Similarly, the suppression of nonnative spe-
cies decreased continuously over the course of the ex-
periment (Fig. 3a). Lastly, root mass decreased in 1994
plots in response to tilling in preparation for broad-
casting, but increased in 1996 plots in response to seed
addition (see Results: Standing crop and roots). All of
these results reﬂect the successional changes from an-
nual dicots to perennial grasses.
Succession in our old ﬁeld was accompanied by an
increase in the cover of the introduced perennial grass
Agropyron cristatum to 25%, suggesting that this old
ﬁeld is susceptible to invasion by nonnative species.
In contrast, ﬁelds abandoned during the 1930s–1950s
returned to dominance by native prairie (Judd 1940,
Cofﬁn et al. 1996, Christian and Wilson 1999). The
difference in the successional end points may have two
causes: A. cristatum has been widely planted since the
1930s, so dispersal from planted stands into unplanted
abandoned ﬁelds has increased over time, and the seed
bank of native species probably had been extirpated by
the time our ﬁeld was abandoned (Bekker et al. 1997,
Wilson 2002).

SEMIARID OLD-FIELD RESTORATION
We used relatively high seeding rates (about 4000
seeds/m2) to allow investigation of other factors (neigh-
bor control, seeding method, mulch). Although this is
much higher than recommended restoration rates (e.g.,
30 seeds/m2; Duebbert et al. 1981) and other experi-
mental rates (e.g., 1450 seeds/m2; Betz 1986), our rates
are similar to the range of seed density in prairie soils
(1000–3000 seeds/m2; Iverson and Wali 1982, Grilz et
al. 1994). We used high rates in order to enhance our
ability to detect experimental effects such as neighbor
control. Optimum seeding densities are well studied
for agricultural crops, but not for perennial grasses
(Pyke and Archer 1991).
In summary, neighbor control had no effect on native
grass establishment. Given the enormous variability of
establishment among years, our results suggest that res-
torations of semiarid old ﬁelds should focus less on
neighbor control and more on strategies for exploiting
suitable years for germination, either by monitoring
soil moisture or through repeated seeding.
