Abstract We examined whether pinyon mice (Peromys-
cus truei) and brush mice (P. boylii) could act as directed
dispersal agents of pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) through
differential responses to soil particle size and rock cover.
In field experiments, we allowed mice to either cache
pinyon seeds or recover artificially cached seeds (pilfer)
from quadrats containing large- or small-particle soils.
Both species placed most (70%) seed caches in small-
particle soil. Pilfering was the same from both particle
sizes in the first year, while more seeds were pilfered from
large-particle
soils in the second year. In separate
experiments, rock cover interacted with soil particle size,
with both species placing over 50% of their caches in
small-particle soil with rock cover. Overall, we found
greater seed-caching in small-particle soils near rocks,
with equal or lower pilfering from small-particle soils,
suggesting more seeds would survive in small-particle
soils near rock cover. Three lines of evidence supported
the hypothesis that mice could act as directed dispersers by
moving pinyon seeds to beneficial microsites for germi-
nation and establishment. First, in greenhouse experi-
ments, pinyon seed germination was 4 times greater in
small-particle soil cores than in large-particle soil cores.
Second, soils near rocks had significantly higher water
content than areas of open soil at the driest time of the
year, a critical factor for seedling survival in the arid
southwestern USA. Third, 75% of juvenile pinyon trees
were growing in small-particle soils, and 45% were
growing near rock nurses.

Introduction
Determining the consequences of animal-mediated seed
dispersal for seedling recruitment is an important goal in
understanding the dynamics of plant-animal interactions.
Scatter-hoarding rodents can consume a significant pro-
portion of seeds they handle, but may also act as seed
dispersers by increasing the effective seed shadow (Vander
Wall and Joyner 1998; Vander Wall 2002) or by moving
seeds to specific microsites that enhance germination and
seedling establishment, a form of directed dispersal (Howe
and Smallwood 1982; Wenny 2001). Several studies have
tested the directed dispersal hypothesis in frugivorous
birds (Reid 1989; Sargent 1995; Wenny and Levey 1998;
Tewksbury et al. 1999) and ant-dispersed systems (Rice
and Westoby 1986; Hanzawa et al. 1988; Passos and
Oliveira 2002). Fewer studies have examined the possi-
bility of directed dispersal by seed-caching rodents (but
see Vander Wall 1993, 1997, 1998b; Hoshizaki et al.
1999), despite their prevalence in a majority of seed-
dispersal systems.
Directed dispersal may be most important for plant
species that depend upon a narrow range of microsite
characteristics for germination and establishment (Harper
1977). Pinyon pines (Pinus spp.) are widely distributed in
arid habitats of the southwestern USA and are dependent
on seed-caching corvid birds (jays and nutcrackers)
(Vander Wall and Balda 1981; Lanner 1996) and rodents
(chipmunks and mice) (Vander Wall 1997) to disperse the
heavy, wingless seed by caching them during periods of
high seed production for later use. Microsites chosen for
seed caching may influence pinyon regeneration because
pinyon seedlings require relatively high soil moisture,
shade, and protection from browsers (Chambers 2001). In
many areas, nurse shrubs provide seedlings with these
characteristics (Calloway et al. 1996; Chambers 2001);
however, other structures, such as downed logs and rocks,
potentially offer similar benefits. In addition to nurse
structures, soil characteristics such as particle size could
affect germination and survival by influencing soil water
potential and nutrient dynamics (Everett et al. 1986;

Chambers 2001). Seed-caching rodents have been shown
to disperse seeds under nurse plants (Vander Wall 1993,
1997; Giannoni et al. 2001), and some studies have
examined dispersal to other nurse structures (Iida 1996),
but there is an absence of studies that have examined
directed dispersal based on soil properties.
Foraging behavior of rodents may be influenced by a
number of environmental characteristics that could lead to
non-random seed dispersal patterns. Substrate qualities
such as soil density and texture can affect the ability of
rodents to find and recover seeds (Price and Heinz 1984;
Price and Podolsky 1989; Morgan and Price 1992; Hughes
et al. 1995; Kotler et al. 2001), and could likewise affect
seed germination and survival. Similarly, rodents may
preferentially forage and/or cache seeds in areas near cover
(Brown et al. 1988; Longland and Price 1991; Vander Wall
1997) thereby altering the rate of seed arrival and removal
from these sites.
We examined the influence of soil substrate and rock
cover on the seed-caching and pilfering behaviors of two
mouse species, Peromyscus truei and P. boylii, that are
closely associated with pinyon-juniper woodlands (Hol-
brook 1978; Hoffmeister 1986). In order to examine the
effects of these parameters on rodent behavior and
subsequent
pinyon
establishment,
we
addressed
the
following three questions:
1.
How do differences in soil particle size and rock cover
affect the caching and pilfering behaviors of the two
mouse species?
2.
How do differences in soil particle size influence
pinyon seed germination rates?
3.
Are established juvenile pinyon pine trees found in
microsites with soil particle sizes and nurse structures
consistent with patterns of rodent seed dispersal?
Study site
This study was conducted in a pinyon-juniper woodland
near Sunset Crater National Monument in the San
Francisco volcanic fields, northern Arizona (approxi-
mately 6,500 feet elevation). Sunset Crater is one of the
youngest scoria cones in the US, last erupting around
1064 A.D. for a period of 200 years. These eruptions
eventually covered over 2,000 km2 with cinders, leaving
the site barren of vegetation, and creating a hotter, drier
environment, less hospitable to plant growth (Krutch
1974). The area now supports pinyon-juniper woodlands
growing in early successional cinder soils. These soils
have low water holding capacity, low nutrient content, and
are highly variable in particle size, ranging from ash to
volcanic boulders (Cobb et al. 1997). Shrub cover is
widely spaced and interspace environments offer harsh
conditions for seedlings due to high soil temperatures and
vulnerability to browsers (Everett et al. 1986; Calloway et
al. 1996), therefore the abundant large volcanic boulders
may be important protective structures for both foraging
mice and pinyon seedlings.
Materials and methods
Particle-size effects on pilfering and caching behaviors
To address the effects of varying soil particle sizes on seed-dispersal
behaviors, we allowed mice, P. boylii and P. truei, to cache or pilfer
pinyon seeds in field enclosures containing two different soil
particle sizes. Soil for these experiments was collected from
naturally occurring patches that consisted of either predominately
small particles (<1.0 mm in diameter) or large particles (>2 mm in
diameter). Each experimental enclosure (2×2.5 m) consisted of 1-m-
high wooden-framed walls covered with hardware cloth. A hinged
top, also of wood frame and hardware cloth, prevented mice from
climbing out while allowing us to access the inside of the enclosure.
The bottom of the enclosure was set on a plastic tarpaulin covering
the natural soil beneath. The floor of the enclosure was divided into
five sections. The middle section (0.5×2 m) was covered with a
wooden plank on which an open live trap containing cotton batting
served as a nesting site. The outer two sections on either side were
each divided into two quadrats (1×1 m each) and were filled to a
depth of 4 cm with either large- or small-particle-sized cinder soils.
Small, artificial “shrubs” were constructed by tying together
branches of naturally occurring shrubs from nearby areas. One
artificial shrub was placed in each quadrat to provide mice with
protective cover. Four of these field enclosures were placed in open
areas at the study site, all at least 2 m from the nearest shrub or tree.
The night before each trial, mice were live-trapped using Sherman
traps within the 1-ha area surrounding the enclosures. The following
morning, an apple slice was added to each of the traps containing
mice to be used in the trials (to provide food and moisture) and traps
were placed in the shade of dense shrubs for the rest of the day. That
evening one mouse was placed in each enclosure and remained there
overnight, with the trap it had been housed in acting as the nest site.
The next morning, mice were removed from the enclosure and
released back at their original trap location.
Caching and pilfering behaviors were observed separately in two
different types of trials. For both types of trials, short pieces of
thread (10 cm) were first tied and then glued to uniquely numbered
pinyon seeds. Thread tails allowed detection of seeds cached
beneath the soil surface, while uniquely numbering the seeds
allowed the fate of individual seeds to be followed through
successive movements. All trials were conducted between the
months of May and August 2001.
In caching trials, 40 seeds were placed on the wooden plank
surface. After each trial period, cache site locations were identified
by locating thread tails protruding from the soil and by searching
each quadrat until all seeds were accounted for. Seed fates were
categorized as: (1) cached in small-particle soil, (2) cached in large-
particle soil, (3) cached in nest box, (4) eaten, and (5) left on wood
plank.
In pilfering trials, 40 seeds (ten in each quadrat) and their thread
tails were completely buried under the soil surface. Seeds were
buried in a grid pattern with approximately 30 cm between each
seed and were at least 5 cm from the edge of the enclosure frame.
Each seed was uniquely numbered and the original quadrat and grid
location where the seed was buried was recorded. One seed in each
quadrat was left on the soil surface to stimulate searching behavior
by the mice. At the end of each trial, seeds either remained
unrecovered, were recovered and eaten, or were recovered and
reburied (recached). Recached seeds were detected when seed
identification numbers indicated a buried seed had been moved from
its original location. Final seed locations were recorded and seed
fates categorized as one or more of the following: (1) pilfered from
small-particle soil, (2) pilfered from large-particle soil, (3) recached
in small-particle soil, (4) recached in large-particle soil, (5) recached
in nestbox, (6) eaten, and (7) unrecovered.
Roughly equal numbers of both male and female mice were used
for the trials. Only individuals that cached or pilfered three or more
seeds were considered in the analysis of the effects of particle size
on caching and pilfering behavior. As a result, ten P. boylii and ten P.
truei were analyzed for caching trials and nine P. boylii and 12 P.
77

truei were analyzed for pilfering trials. In eight cases, the same
individual was used for both types of trials, but in each case,
whether the caching trial or pilfering trial was presented first was
randomized based on a coin toss. The percentages of seeds cached
or pilfered in small-versus large-particle soils were normalized using
a square root transformation and were compared using ANOVA.
Interactive effects of particle size and rock cover
To address the interactive effects of soil particle size and the
presence or absence of rock cover on seed-dispersal behaviors, mice
were allowed to cache and pilfer 40 seeds in enclosures containing
two different soil particle sizes as before. However, in this
experiment, cover was also manipulated by presenting rocks as
cover in two of the four quadrats, while the other two quadrats
lacked cover of any kind. The placement of rocks in a particular
quadrat was randomly determined for each trial to avoid site effects.
To avoid the possibility that the wooden frame of the enclosure
unintentionally affected caching behavior by providing mice with
cover, seeds that were cached within 5 cm from the frame edges
were excluded from the analysis. These trials were conducted
between May and August 2002.
For both caching and pilfering trials, seed locations were recorded
and their fates categorized as one or more of the following: (1)
cached, pilfered or recached in small-particle soils without rock
cover, (2) cached, pilfered or recached in small-particle soils with
rock cover, (3) cached, pilfered or recached in large-particle soils
without rock cover, (4) cached, pilfered or recached in large-particle
soil with rock, (5) eaten, (6) cached in nest box, or (7) left on the
surface of a wooden plank or unrecovered.
As in the first experiment, roughly equal numbers of both male
and female mice were used for the trials and only individuals that
cached or pilfered three or more seeds were considered in the
analysis. Ten P. boylii and ten P. truei were analyzed for both
caching and pilfering trials. Eleven individuals were used for both
types of trials, and in each case the type of trial (pilfer or cache) first
encountered was randomized. Two of the 11 individuals used in both
trials cached and pilfered in the same microhabitat selected in the
first trial, while the remaining nine showed no pattern, suggesting
that previous experience did not strongly influence behavior in the
subsequent trial.
The percentage of seeds cached and pilfered for the four different
treatment types was normalized using square root transformation
and analyzed using ANOVA with soil particle size and rock cover as
fixed factors.
To determine whether the two mouse species differed in their
propensity to cache seeds versus eat them, we combined trials from
both years and compared the ratio of seeds cached to those eaten
using a t-test. Likewise, to test whether the species differed in their
ability to detect experimentally cached seeds, we combined trials
across years and compared the number of seeds pilfered by each
species.
Soil moisture
Because soil moisture has been shown to affect the ability of rodents
to detect seeds (Vander Wall 1995), soil samples were collected from
each enclosure to determine whether soil moisture differed between
soil particle sizes and across years. Samples were taken at 3 times
each year, during early, mid and late June when the majority of
experimental trials were conducted. We used repeated measures
ANOVA to test for differences between large- and small-particle
soils within each year and a paired t-test to test for differences in soil
moisture across years, with samples paired by enclosure, soil
particle size and time of year. In addition, to test whether soil
moisture differed between microsites near natural rock outcrops and
nearby open areas, in late June (the driest period of the year) we
haphazardly selected 20 rock outcrops in our study area where we
collected soil: (1) from within 5 cm of the base of the rock, and (2)
from an open area of soil approximately 2 m away. Soil samples
(approximately 50 ml) were sealed in plastic ziploc bags, taken to
the laboratory, weighed, oven-dried at 105°C for 24 h and then
reweighed. Percent soil moisture was calculated by dividing the
difference between wet and dry soil mass by the dry soil weight. We
tested for differences in soil moisture between rock cover and open
sites using a paired t-test.
Pinyon pine germination
To address how soil particle size affected pinyon pine germination,
140 soil cores, 70 of small- and 70 of large-particle soils, were
collected from the study site. Soil was collected with a plastic soil
corer (0.5 cm in diameter) and cores were immediately placed into
planting pots. The planting pots were transported to a greenhouse
and pinyon seeds were placed approximately 2 cm below the
surface. Prior to planting, pinyon seeds were tested for viability
using a pentane test. Seeds were watered daily and the number of
seeds that germinated after 45 days were recorded. The total number
of seeds germinating in small- versus large-particle soils was
compared using a χ2-test.
Soil particle size and rock cover variability
To address whether our experiment accurately represented caching
and pilfering choices Peromyscus would have in the natural
environment, we recorded soil particle size and rock cover
availability along haphazardly selected, non-overlapping transects
across our study area. To assess soil particle size variability, we
collected four, 50-ml soil samples (to a depth of 3–4 cm below the
surface) at 10-m intervals along a 100-m transect. Within a 5-m
radius of each collection point, we selected two samples in the open
(>2 m from a rock) that visually appeared to represent the extremes
in soil particle size available at that site. We then did the same to
obtain two samples of soil particle size extremes from within 1 cm
of a rock. Each sample was sifted into small- (<2 mm) and large-
particle (>2 mm) size classes using Tyler soil sieves. The percentage
(by weight) of each sample made up of each particle size was used
to determine the dominant soil particle size. A particle-size class was
considered dominant if it contributed >65% to the weight of the
sample. If neither size class contributed >65%, then the sample was
considered mixed. To assess rock cover availability, we determined
the distance to the nearest rock at 10-m intervals along two 100-m
transects. The distance to the nearest rock was categorized as <2, 2–
5, 5–10 and >10 m from the sample point.
Soil particle microsite and nurse association of juvenile pinyon
pines
To
address
whether
established
juvenile
pinyon
pines
were
associated with particular microsites, four 1,000-m transects were
haphazardly chosen and all pinyons under 1 m in height growing
within 50 m of either side of transect lines were located.
Measurements taken for each pinyon included height, nurse
association and particle size of soil at the base of the stem. Particle
size was determined based on a categorical designation.
Results
Overall, mice cached some seeds in 80% of the trials and
pilfered some seeds in 100% of the trials. Of the caching
trials in 2001 where three or more seeds were cached, mice
cached between 23 and 37% of the available seeds
(Fig. 1a). P. boylii ate approximately the same percentage
78

of seeds as were cached, whereas P. truei ate more seeds
than were cached, but the ratio of cached to eaten seeds
did not differ significantly between species (t=1.63, df=44,
P=0.11). In the pilfering trials of 2001, approximately 40%
of the available seeds were pilfered (Fig. 1b) and there was
no significant difference between species in the number of
seeds pilfered (t=0.52, df=38, P=0.60). Of the seeds
pilfered, both species ate more of the pilfered seeds than
were
recached,
with
P.
boylii
recaching
a
greater
percentage of the seeds than P. truei (t=2.34, df=19,
P=0.01).
Particle-size effects on pilfering and caching behaviors
Soil particle size affected the caching behavior of both
species of mice (Fig. 2a, Table 1), with approximately
40% more seeds cached in small-particle soil compared to
the percentage cached in large-particle soil. Recaching
behavior showed the same pattern. Of the seven P. boylii
that recached seeds, all placed more seeds in the small-
particle soils [mean number in small=4.0±2.1 SE (96%)
vs. 0.4±0 (4%) in large]. Five of the seven P. truei that
recached seeds placed more in small-particle quadrats
[mean number of seeds recached in small=1.1±0.4 (79%)
vs. 0.4±0.3 (21 %) in large]. In contrast, particle size did
not affect the pilfering behavior of either species, as mice
pilfered similar proportions from both small and large soil
particles (Fig. 2b, Table 1).
Interactive effects of particle size and cover
When both rock cover and soil particle size were varied,
both species cached a greater percentage of seeds in small
soil particles with rock cover (Fig. 3a, Table 2). However,
there was a significant interaction between species and
rock cover, with P. boylii showing no difference in caching
behavior between large-particle size quadrats with rock
cover and open treatments, while P. truei cached a greater
portion (approximately 30%) of the remaining seeds in the
large-particle quadrat with rock cover.
Both species of mice pilfered a greater portion of seeds
from large-particle soils but were not affected by the
presence or absence of cover (Fig. 3b, Table 2). P. truei
was affected by particle size more than P. boylii, pilfering
50% more seeds from large-particle soils than from small-

particle soils. This pattern differed from that of 2001
where no significant difference in pilfering behavior was
found between the two particle sizes (Fig. 2b).
Soil moisture
Soil moisture did not differ significantly between large-
(mean=0.19%±0.01 SE) and small-particle soils (0.18%
±0.01) taken from within the experimental enclosures in
2002 (F=0.465, P=0.53). In 2001, there was a significant
interaction, with soil moisture significantly higher in
small-particle soils at one sampling period (small=0.79%
±0.02, large=0.56%±0.02) and higher in large-particle
soils at the other two sampling periods (small=0.21%
±0.04, large=0.39±0.07, F=15.2, P=0.002). Soil moisture
was approximately 50% lower in 2002 (mean=0.18%
±0.01) than in 2001 (mean=0.42%±0.05) due to a severe
drought in the region. Soil moisture at the base of natural
rock outcrops (0.16%±0.01) was significantly higher than
at paired open sites (0.13%±0.01) in late June 2002, the
driest period of the year (t=2.1, df=19, P=0.048).
Pinyon pine germination
Pinyon pine seeds were approximately 4 times more likely
to germinate in small- vs. large-particle soil cores. Thirty-
nine of the 70 seeds (56%) planted in small-particle soil
cores germinated versus 11 (16%) in large-particle soil
cores (χ2=15.68, df=1, P<0.001).
Particle size and rock cover variability
The majority of the points surveyed (80%) showed some
variability in soil particle size within the 5-m radius that
was sampled. Both large- and small-particle patches were
available at 30% of the sample points, small- and mixed or
large- and mixed particle-size soil patches were available
at 50% of the sample points, and 20% of the sample points
had only one size class available. Rock cover was
available at all of the sample points, with the nearest
rock within 2 m in 55% of the sample points, within 2–5 m
in 35%, within 5–10 m in 5% and >10 m in 5% of the
sampling points.
Particle size, pinyon pine and microsite associations
Seventy-five percent of the 110 juvenile pinyon pines we
surveyed were associated with small-particle soils. Forty-
five percent were associated with rock nurses and all of
these were in small-particle soils. Shrubs were associated
with 35% of pinyons, with 68% of those in large- or
medium-particle soils. Four percent of pinyons were
associated with both a rock and a shrub. Relatively few
pinyons were found beneath trees or near logs (7%) and
the remaining 9% of pinyons were in small-particle soils in
interspace environments.
Discussion
Soil particle-size effects
Across both experiments and mouse species, soil particle
size had a significant effect on caching behavior, with
more
pinyon
seeds
cached
in
small-particle
soils.
Although recaching rates were relatively low, mice also
recached seeds more often and in larger amounts in small-
particle soils. In contrast, mice showed no difference in
their tendency to pilfer seeds from soils of differing
particle size, although P. truei pilfered significantly more
from large-particle soils in the second year of the study.
One hypothesis invoked to explain differences in
caching and pilfering behavior is the pilfering avoidance
hypothesis (MacDonald 1976), where cache strategy is
determined by the likelihood of pilferage. For example,
Merriam’s kangaroo rats (Dipodomys merriami) reduced
the number of scatterhoards and increased the number of
larder hoards after seeds were pilfered by a conspecific
(Preston and Jacobs 2001). Likewise,
fox squirrels
(Sciurus niger) were hypothesized to cache seeds far
from the forest edge where predation threats decreased the
likelihood of competitors searching for caches (Stapanian
and Smith 1984). If this hypothesis held for mice in this
study, we would have expected rates of pilfering to be
lower in the small-particle soils where mice preferred to
cache seeds and higher in large-particle soils that they
avoided. The pilfering behavior in the first experiment and
first year of this study did not support this hypothesis;

seeds were pilfered with equal likelihood regardless of soil
type. However, in the second experiment and second year
of the study, both species pilfered more from large-particle
soils, though this pattern was stronger for P. truei. As a
result, caching in soils with smaller particle sizes could
potentially lower the probability of cache pilferage, but not
at all times.
Because mice use olfaction to find buried seeds
(Howard and Cole 1967; Howard et al. 1968; Vander
Wall 1998a), differences in soil particle size could lead to
differences in the ability of mice to detect buried seeds in
these soils. Large-particle soils have greater macroporosity
and therefore greater air movement (Brady and Weil 2000)
and may consequently allow easier seed odor detection
than the microporous, small-particle soils. Higher soil and
seed moisture levels are also associated with greater seed
odor detection, increasing the discovery of buried seeds by
rodents (Johnson and Jorgensen 1981; Vander Wall 1993,
1995, 2000, 2003). In our experimental soils, soil moisture
levels were relatively similar between small- and large-
particle soils within a year. However, between years,
moisture levels decreased from approximately 0.4–0.2%
due to a regional drought. Interestingly, seed pilfering rates
from both soil particle sizes were 20% lower in the second
year compared to the first. These decreases are consistent
with other studies showing 30–90% reductions in pilfering
rates by deer mice between wet and dry soils (Vander Wall
1995, 2000). However, pilfering rates decreased more in
small-particle soils, despite equally decreased soil moist-
ure levels. This may have been due to the fact that smaller
particle sizes have overall larger surface areas and
therefore may lose water, and the odorants associated
with it, at a slower rate than large-particle soils (Vander
Wall 2003).
Several studies have shown that soil particle size and
seed size can interact to affect the rate of seed recovery
(Price and Heinz 1984; Price and Podolsky 1989; Hughes
et al. 1995; Kotler et al. 2001). Generally, seed recovery is
more rapid when seeds are larger than soil particles and
recovery rates decline as seed size and particle size
become more similar (Price and Podolsky 1989; Hughes et
al. 1995). In our experiments, pinyon seeds were much
larger than the soil particles in the small-particle treatment
but approached the size of some soil particles in the large-
particle treatment. Even so, pilfering rates did not differ
between the two treatments, or when they did it was biased
toward large particle sizes. This may have been due to the
fact that recovery of large pinyon seeds depends more on
simply uncovering the seed rather than sifting the seed
from soil, as is the case for many of the heteromyids and
jerboids in other studies.
Substrate could potentially affect the energetic cost of
digging, and studies of heteromyid rodents found the
energetic costs of scratch digging to be an important part
of foraging cost, in some cases 5–10 times the cost of
locomotion (Morgan and Price 1992). However, most
studies failed to find a significant difference in energetic
costs of digging among soils differing in either soil density
(Morgan and Price 1992) or soil type (Vleck 1979).
Unfortunately, we know of no studies that have examined
the energetic costs of digging for soil particle sizes like
those examined in this study.
Rock cover effects
Caching behavior was also affected by rock cover, with
more seeds cached near rock structures in small-particle
soils. Mice made 69% (P. boylii) and 84% (P. truei) of
caches under or near rock cover, percentages similar to
those of Vander Wall’s (1993, 1995, and 1997) field
studies where chipmunks, mice and kangaroo rats cached
between 50 and 79% of seeds under or at the edge of shrub
cover. This behavior could be the result of using rocks to
aid in the recovery of seeds via spatial memory (McQuade
et al. 1986). Alternatively, mice may have cached near
rock cover because rocks afforded greater protection from
predators. Several studies have documented higher rodent
foraging activity near cover when predation risk was high
(Abramsky et al. 1996; Kotler 1984). However, this
hypothesis is not consistent with the lack of effect of rock
cover on pilfering behavior, at least for P. truei, which
apparently spent equivalent effort pilfering seeds from
large-particle soils with and without rock cover. This trend
contrasts with that from field studies in scrublands and
desert ecosystems where seeds and seedlings incurred the
greatest mortality under cover due to rodent predation
(O’Dowd and Hay 1980; Hulme 1994; Chambers 2001).
These studies suggest that rodents search for seeds where
predation risk is low (Brown et al. 1988), and seed
densities are typically high (Reichman 1984; Price and
Reichman 1987). This inconsistency could be due to
conditions unique to the design of the field enclosure.
Both the enclosure frame and the short distance between
open areas and rock cover may have affected how the
rodents perceived predation vulnerability during the trials.
However, if this were the case a similar pattern would have
been expected in the caching trials.
Importance of soil particle size and cover for pinyon
seed and seedling survival
Our data showed that pinyon seeds in small-particle soils
were more likely to germinate than seeds in large-particle
soils.
Although
microsite
requirements
for
seedling
survival may be different than for seed germination
(Schupp 1995), the majority of small pinyons growing at
our study site were associated with small-particle soils
rather than large, suggesting seedling survival may also be
greater in the small soil particle microsites. In sagebrush
steppe habitats of southwestern Wyoming, Chambers
(2000) documented both higher seed germination and 2-
year seedling survival of several plant species in sandy
soils compared to gravel soils despite a greater abundance
of seeds entrapped in the gravel soils, and attributed this
difference to less negative water potentials and overall
greater soil water availability in sandy soils.

Small pinyons in our study site were associated with
rocks
(45%)
as
frequently
as
with
shrubs
(35%),
suggesting that rocks may also serve as nurse structures.
Several studies have indicated that nurse plants offer the
best microsite for pinyon establishment (Calloway et al.
1996; Drivas and Everett 1988; Chambers 2001) and one
documented higher soil moisture, decreased ambient
temperatures and protection from browsers under nurse
shrubs in west-central Nevada (Chambers 2001). Artificial
shade
alone
can
increase
pinyon
seedling
survival
(Meagher 1943) and rocks could act in a similar fashion.
Red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) seedlings near rocks had
higher survival than those farther from rock protection,
presumably due to both protection from browsing and
trampling
by cattle
and higher soil moisture
from
snowmelt and runoff during rains (Livingston 1972).
Our data suggest that soils near rocks have higher moisture
content than nearby open areas, a factor that may be
especially important in arid ecosystems where rainfall is a
major limiting factor and soils exhibit greater negative
water potentials. One potential advantage of rock micro-
sites over shrub microsites for pinyon regeneration is that
there would no opportunity for the potentially negative
effects of competition between pinyon seedlings and their
shrub nurses (Bertness and Calloway 1994).
Mice as directed dispersers
Dispersal agents may be considered directed dispersers if a
disproportionate number of seeds are deposited in suitable
sites for seed germination and survival. Our survey of
substrate variability indicated that both soil particle size
and rock availability at our site varied at spatial scales (5 m
radius around a point) relevant to those at which mice
make choices among potential cache microsites. Caching
patterns suggest mice could act as directed dispersers by
moving pinyon seeds to suitable microsites in small-
particle soils near rock nurses, and pilfering patterns
suggest seeds would have equal or higher survival rates in
those microsites. The pattern of seedling germination and
natural seedling distribution documented in this study is
consistent with the hypothesis that these microsites
enhance early seedling establishment and survival.
The geographic ranges of the two Peromyscus species
studied here (P. boylii and P. truei) overlap broadly with
each other and with pinyon pines (Holbrook 1978;
Hoffmeister 1986). Although pinyon pine in this study
were growing entirely on relatively recently derived cinder
soils, variation in soil particle sizes like those studied here
occur across many different soil types and habitats
(Chambers 2000), suggesting that the behaviors docu-
mented here could be important throughout the range of
these trees. Finally, the strong similarity in caching and
pilfering behavior of these sympatric mouse species
suggests that differences in these behaviors are unlikely
to act as a mechanism for species coexistence, as has been
argued to be the case for some heteromyid rodents (Price
et al. 2000; Leaver and Daly 2001). However, these
species were not identical in their responses to rock cover,
or in their tendency to cache seeds. P. truei cached fewer
seeds overall, and placed more seeds in large-particle soils
with rock cover, two behaviors that suggest it may be a
slightly lower quality disperser than P. boylii.
