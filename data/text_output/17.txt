Abstract: We measured soil seed banks in 102 plots within a 110 000 ha Arizona Pinus ponderosa 
landscape, determined seed-bank responses to fire cues and tree canopy types (open or densely treed 
patches), compared seed-bank composition among ecosystem types, and assessed the utility of seed banks 
for ecological restoration. Liquid smoke was associated with increased community-level emergence from 
seed banks in greenhouse experiments, whereas heating to 100 [degrees]C had minimal effect and charred 
P. ponderosa wood decreased emergence. We detected 103 species in seed-bank samples and 280 species 
in aboveground vegetation. Erigeron divergens was the commonest seed-bank species; with the exception 
of Gnaphalium exilifolium, species detected in seed banks also occurred above ground. Although a dry, 
sandy-textured blackcinder ecosystem exhibited the greatest seed density, seed-bank composition was 
more ecosystem-specific than was seed density. Native graminoids (e.g., Carex geophila and 
Muhlenbergia montana) were common in seed banks, whereas perennial forbs were sparse, particularly 
under dense tree canopies. Our results suggest that (i) smoke may increase emergence from seed banks in 
these forests, (ii) seed banks can assist establishment of major graminoids but not forbs during 
ecological restoration, and (iii) seed-bank composition is partly ecosystem-specific across the landscape.

Introduction 
Soil seed banks consist of viable seeds stored in O horizons and mineral soils (Harper 1977; Roberts 
1981; Thompson 1987). Seed banks provide propagules for vegetation maintenance and reestablishment when 
the germination requirements of the constituent seeds are met (Warr et al. 1993; Baskin and Baskin 
1998). Germination requirements for some species are fulfilled after canopy-reducing disturbances or fire 
(Odion and Davis 2000; Korb et al. 2005). However, these conditions may stimulate emergence of both 
desirable and undesirable species, underscoring the importance of understanding seed-bank composition and 
its reaction to disturbances (Bakker et al. 1996; Halpern et al. 1999). 
Fire is a key disturbance in many ecosystems, and its effects on soil seed banks have been 
increasingly documented in the past 15 years (Van Staden et al. 2000). Fire cues such as smoke, heat, ash, 
or charred wood stimulate germination of some species that otherwise exhibit low germination rates (Baldwin et 
al. 1994; Dixon et al. 1995; Blank and Young 1998). For example, Keeley et al. (1985) reported that germination 
of about half of 30 tested species from California chaparral responded positively to heating or to additions 
of charred Adenostoma fasciculatum (chamise) wood. In Australian heath ecosystems, Burne et al. (2003) 
found that two Grevillea shrub species emerged only on plots sprayed with liquid smoke. Similarly, Roche et 
al. (1997) discovered that aerosol smoke sharply increased emergence from 5 to 246 seeds/[m.sup.2] in 
seed banks of Australian Eucalyptus forests. In addition to illustrating that fire cues can promote field 
emergence, these studies suggest that fire cues may increase detection of species during assessments of 
seed-bank composition in laboratory emergence tests. 
Environmental gradients also may affect the size and composition of soil seed banks through several 
possible mechanisms. For example, soil or topographic variation could constrain the distribution of 
aboveground vegetation that provides inputs to seed banks, or disturbances such as fire could interact 
with environmental gradients. While seed banks have been compared among microhabitats (Reichman 1984) 
and at the scale of biomes (Thompson 1978), few studies have examined landscape-scale variation in seed 
banks among soil, topographic, or ecosystem types within geographic regions (Kramer and Johnson 1987). 
In southwestern British Columbia forests, McGee and Feller (1993) reported that seed-bank densities were 
lowest on xeric sites, possibly because seed production was limited on these sites. Similarly, Ashton et al. 
(1998) found that seed-bank composition changed with topography in a Connecticut deciduous forest, with

Carex glaucodea (blue sedge) and Carex lupulina (hop sedge) dominating seed banks on moist, lower slopes. 
The results of these studies suggest that there is potential for seed-bank size and composition to vary as 
much within a landscape as among biomes. Ecosystem classification, grouping sites that are similar in 
topography, soil, and vegetation into types across a landscape (Barnes et al. 1982; Host and Pregitzer 1992; 
Abella et al. 2003), provides a potentially useful, yet unexplored, framework for examining landscape-
scale variation in seed-bank characteristics. 
We undertook a multifactor soil seed bank study on a northern Arizona Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa 
pine) landscape, providing an opportunity to examine the effects of fire cues, environmental gradients, and 
tree densities on seed-bank size and composition. We studied these three factors in combination because they 
may interact to affect seed banks, and are also interrelated for ecological restoration and forest management 
in this region. Several authors have proposed that P. ponderosa forests in the southwestern United States 
receive extensive tree thinning and burning to accomplish ecological restoration and management 
objectives (Covington et al. 1994; Allen et al. 2002). Little is known, however, about the potential contributions 
of soil seed banks to the restoration of understories in this widespread forest type or the responses of seed 
banks to tree thinning and burning (Korb et al. 2005). Encompassing more than 3.4 million ha in Arizona and 
New Mexico alone, P. ponderosa forests occupy large landscapes containing a variety of soil and ecosystem 
types (Brown 1994). This indicates potential for large abiotically induced variation in seed banks within and 
among landscapes. While studies of seed banks at only one or a few sites, which are common in seed-
bank research (Baskin and Baskin 1998), are useful for specific purposes, broader studies encompassing many 
sites also are important for understanding landscape-scale variation in seed banks at scales where 
operational forest management is proposed (Covington et al. 1994). 
In this study we integrated multivariate field data (environmental variables, aboveground vegetation and 
tree structure, and seed-bank composition) with greenhouse seed and seed-bank experiments to 
elucidate landscape-scale variation in seed banks and their reactions to fire cues. Our specific objectives were to 
(i) determine seed-bank responses to the fire cues heat, charred wood, and smoke using greenhouse 
experiments; (ii) compare seed-bank density and composition among environmental gradients and 
regional landscapes classified into ecosystem types; (iii) assess the effects of P.ponderosa canopy type (open 
or densely treed patches), which is affected by restoration thinning, on seed-bank density and composition; 
and (iv) ascertain which species may establish from seed banks during ecological restoration and management 
in this landscape. 
Materials and methods 
Study area 
Our seed-bank collections were made at elevations between 1920 and 2660 m within a 110 000 ha 
landscape surrounding the city of Flagstaff, Arizona, in the Northern Arizona University Centennial Forest and 
the northern half of the Coconino National Forest (study area: southeast corner (35[degrees]01'N, 111
[degrees]23'W), southwest corner (35[degrees]04'N, 111[degrees]53'W), northwest corner (35[degrees]29'N, 
111[degrees]51'W), and northeast corner (35[degrees]23'N, 111[degrees]31'W)). Based on data from

three weather stations, total precipitation across the study area ranges from 42 to 56 cm/year, snowfall from 
152 to 233 cm/year, and mean maximum daily temperatures from 15.7 to 17.5 [degrees]C (Western 
Regional Climate Center, Reno, Nev.). Soil parent materials include volcanic cinders, basalt, benmoreite, 
and limestone. Major soil subgroups are Typic and Udic Argiborolls, Typic and Mollic Eutroboralfs, 
Typic Ustorthents, and Vitrandic Ustochrepts (Miller et al. 1995). Slope gradients are <10% on most of the 
study area, but cinder cones, ravines, and low hills punctuate the undulating topography. Before fire 
exclusion, beginning in the late 1800s, return intervals for primarily lightning-ignited surface fires averaged 
<10 years (Fule et al. 1997). Livestock grazing has been widespread since the late 1800s, and grazing by 
Cervus elaphus (Rocky Mountain elk) and other ungulates also occurs (Clary 1975). Tree species include 
P. ponderosa, which forms extensive pure stands, Quercus gambelii (Gambel oak), and less commonly 
Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen), Pinus edulis (two-needle pinyon), and Juniperus spp. Understories 
are dominated primarily by graminoids, including Festuca arizonica (Arizona fescue), Muhlenbergia 
montana (mountain muhly), Carex geophila (White Mountain sedge), Bouteloua gracilis (blue grama), and 
Elymus elymoides (squirreltail). 
Field procedures and ecosystem classification 
We sampled sixty-six 0.05 ha (20 m x 25 m) plots by measuring one plot in each of six randomly selected 
mapping units of 11 soil types (Nos. 55, 500, 513, 523, 536, 551, 558, 570, 582, 585, and 611) mapped in 
a terrestrial ecosystem survey of the study area (Miller et al. 1995). We did not sample rare soil types, such 
as those in springs or deep canyons, as our ecosystem classification focused on widespread landscape 
ecosystems occupying most of the study area. We designate these 66 plots as ecosystem plots in this paper, 
and we classified them into ecosystem types based on multivariate analyses of environment and 
vegetation characteristics using methods detailed in Abella and Covington (2006). We identified 10 
ecosystem types, ranging from dry, coarse-textured black-cinder ecosystems to moist, nitrogen (N)-rich aspen 
and treeless park ecosystems (Table 1). Four basalt ecosystems differentiated from each other along soil-
texture and rockiness gradients, and xeric and mesic limestone ecosystems similar in texture differentiated along 
a regional precipitation gradient (Western Regional Climate Center). Park ecosystems occupied depressions 
ranging from 2 to >1000 ha, received exceptionally heavy grazing (Clary 1975), and were dominated by 
Erigeron divergens (spreading fleabane), Muhlenbergia wrightii (spike muhly), and Symphyotrichum 
ascendens (western aster). 
Ecosystem plots were located below open canopies, usually outside patches of old trees (White et al. 
1991). Historically these openings were a dominant feature in many P. ponderosa forests before fire exclusion 
and Euro-American settlement facilitated widespread tree invasion of openings (Covington et al. 1994; Allen et 
al. 2002). We based the ecosystem classification on these remnant open plots to capture understory 
communities that were less suppressed by trees than those below densely treed patches (Abella and 
Covington 2006). We also sampled 36 additional plots, 18 in open areas (>1 cm DBH P. ponderosa, mean 
density 150 trees/ha) and 18 under dense canopies (P. ponderosa, mean density 1320 trees/ha), in 
three terrestrial ecosystem survey types (Nos. 536, 570, and 585) to compare seed banks among canopy 
types. Understory vegetation on open plots averaged 11% cover and 7 species/[m.sup.2] compared with only 
6% cover and 4 species/[m.sup.2] on densely treed plots.

We measured seed banks, soils, geomorphology, and aboveground vegetation on all 102 plots. Using a 4.2 
cm diameter cylinder, we collected seed-bank samples of 70 [cm.sup.3] from 0-5 and 5-10 cm mineral-soil 
depths in each of fifteen 1 [m.sup.2] subplots per plot, yielding a composite plot sample of 1050 [cm.sup.3] 
for each depth. Subplots were located 0.5, 5, 12.5, 20, and 24.5 m along the southern, center, and northern 
plot axes. Although litter can trap seeds (Strickler and Edgerton 1976; Halpern et al. 1999), we focused on 
mineral-soil seed banks because our open-canopy plots contained patchy, sparse litter layers. Sampling was 
done from mid-May to August 2003. Based on published phenologies of species in the study area (Clary and 
Kruse 1979), seed-bank collections likely primarily represent the persistent seed bank (Baskin and Baskin 
1998) because sampling was carried out before most species had dispersed seeds. However, it is possible 
that some early-flowering species contributed current-year seeds to samples. We also categorized areal cover 
of each plant species rooted in subplots, inventoried all species in whole plots on a presence/absence basis, 
and recorded Oihorizon thickness, slope gradient, aspect, and elevation of each plot (Abella and Covington 
2006). Composite soil samples were collected at 0-15 and 15-50 cm depths at two pits per plot, air-dried 
and sieved through a 2 mm mesh sieve, and analyzed for texture (hydrometer method), pH (1:2 soil : 0.01 mol/
L Ca[Cl.sub.2]), and organic carbon (C) and total N (using a C/N analyzer after HCl removal of inorganic 
C) following Bartels and Bigham (1996) and Dane and Topp (2002). We also estimated soil available water 
capacity from texture, gravel content, and organic matter (organic C x 1.724) following Saxton et al. (1986). 
Summer seed-bank study 
Using the emergence method (Warr et al. 1993) we performed an initial study of summer seed-bank 
composition on untreated 0-5 and 5-10 cm depth samples started in the greenhouse on the same day each 
sample was collected (Table 2). These samples were assigned an emergence period of mid-May 2003 to 
January 2004. We chose the emergence method, rather than directly extracting seeds from the soil 
samples, because it provides a measure of readily germinable seeds and does not require identification of 
seeds (Baskin and Baskin 1998). 
We placed the seed-bank samples in square 700 [cm.sup.3] pots. We filled these pots with 120 [cm.sup.3] of 
seed-bank soil 1 cm thick overlying 300 [cm.sup.3] of sterile potting soil (United Industries Co., St. Louis, 
Mo.). Pots were randomly arranged on benches in a greenhouse maintained at 24 [degrees]C and given 4 h 
(0600-0800 and 1800-2000) of daily artificial lighting except in the summer months of May-August. We 
watered and checked samples daily, and every 2 weeks we counted emerging seedlings in each pot. It is 
possible that a seedling could have emerged, died, and disappeared during the 2-week sampling interval. 
However, we believe that we missed few seedlings, because our daily checks did not indicate mortality 
problems, and we were able to identify dead seedlings by matching them to seedlings that survived to 
maturity. We randomly interspersed 24 pots containing only potting soil to check for greenhouse 
seed contamination. Conyza canadensis (Canadian horseweed) was a contaminant, so we deleted the species 
from the summer-study data. This species was not a contaminant in later experiments, and was detected in 
seed-bank samples from only 1 of 102 plots. Nomenclature and native/exotic species classifications followed the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (2004).

After square-root transformation to meet assumptions of equal variance (Levene's test) and normality 
(Shapiro-Wilk W test), we compared seed densities among classified ecosystem types using one-way ANOVA 
and Tukey's test for multiple comparisons. We performed analyses in SAS[R] JMP (SAS Institute Inc. 2002). 
We also ordinated seed-bank composition (seeds/[m.sup.2] relativized by plot totals) and aboveground 
vegetation importance values (average of relative frequency and relative cover summing to 100% on a plot 
basis) using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (autopilot, thorough mode). We performed these analyses 
using PC-ORD (McCune and Mefford 1999). 
Seed-bank experiments 
We conducted five experiments on 0-5 cm depth samples stored at -5 [degrees]C for 4-6 months after 
collection (summarized in Table 2). We followed procedures of sample placement in pots and greenhouse care 
of samples identical with those described above for the summer seed-bank study. We performed 
experimental treatments in January 2004 and assigned to samples an emergence period of January-October 
2004 (10 months). 
In experiment 1 we tested the effects of heat, liquid smoke, and ecosystem type on emergence density and 
species richness in a factorial three-factor experiment using samples from 33 randomly selected ecosystem 
plots (Table 2). Each of four samples per plot received either no treatment, exposure to 100 [degrees]C heat for 
30 min, 60 mL of 10% liquid smoke, or heat + liquid smoke (33 plots x 4 pots each = 132 pots in total). 
There were 11 levels of the ecosystem-type factor corresponding to 11 ecosystem types. We heated 
pots containing potting and seed-bank soil in an electric oven and prepared liquid smoke solutions by 
diluting commercially available liquid smoke (Wright's Brand, Roseland, N.J.) with deionized water. 
Previous research had shown that aerosol smoke and liquid smoke have similar effects on germination (Van 
Staden et al. 2000). Furthermore, Flematti et al. (2004) recently isolated a butenolide compound that is 
contained in any vegetation-derived smoke thought to enhance germination in smoke-stimulated species. 
Experiment 2 was a two-factor experiment using the remaining 33 ecosystem plots to test ecosystem types 
and treatments, including exposure to 50 [degrees]C heat for 30 min, addition of 30 mL of charred P. 
ponderosa wood intermixed with the seed-bank soil, exposure to 100 [degrees]C heat for 30 min + charred 
P. ponderosa wood, and exposure to 100 [degrees]C heat for 30 min + charred P. ponderosa wood + 10% 
liquid smoke (33 plots x 4 pots each = 132 pots in total). We prepared charred wood (blackened, with no 
visible bark remaining) by burning P. ponderosa logs and grinding burned pieces to pass a 4 mm mesh sieve. 
Experiment 3 was a two-factor experiment testing canopy type (open or dense) and treatment, and consisted of 
a single or double (30 days after initial application) exposure to 100 [degrees]C heat for 30 min or a single 
or double addition of 60 mL of 10% liquid smoke. We used 9 plots for each canopy type in this experiment 
(18 plots x 4 pots each = 72 pots in total). Experiments 4 and 5 each included nine dense-canopy plots, 
with experiment 4 including the same treatments as experiment 1, and experiment 5 including the 
same treatments as experiment 2 (9 plots x 4 pots each = 36 pots in total for each experiment).

In all seed-bank experiments we defined plots as a random blocking variable for variance reduction because 
four seed-bank samples per plot were extracted for treatment from composite plot samples. We analyzed 
the experiments using ANOVA and Tukey's test after square root transforming seed density and species richness 
to meet assumptions of equal variance and normality. We considered treatment differences statistically 
significant at p < 0.05. Because seed-bank data are known for their high variability (Baskin and Baskin 1998), 
and our data set is no exception, we also highlight descriptive trends in treatment means. 
Known-seed experiment 
Concurrently with the seed-bank experiments we performed a known-seed experiment testing heat and 
smoke effects on emergence of seeds of six species common in northern Arizona P. ponderosa forests. The 
seeds were collected locally and stored at -5 [degrees]C for 4 months. Our purpose was to determine if 
the emergence requirements of these species were met, thus addressing a criticism of the seed bank 
emergence method (Warr et al. 1993). This experiment was a three-factor, split-plot factorial design consisting 
of two levels of the whole-plot factor heat (none, exposure to 100 [degrees]C for 30 min), two levels of the 
subplot factor smoke (none, 60 mL of 10% liquid smoke), and six levels of species (E. elymoides, F. 
arizonica, Geranium caespitosum (pineywoods geranium), Lupinus argenteus (silvery lupine), Penstemon 
barbatus (beardlip penstemon), Thalictrum fendleri (Fendler's meadow-rue)). Three replicate pots were used 
for each of the 24 treatment combinations, and seeds were lightly pressed in four rows of four seeds in each 
pot (16 seeds/pot) on 120 [cm.sup.3] of locally collected basalt soil overlying 300 [cm.sup.3] of potting soil. 
We analyzed the results of this experiment using ANOVA and Tukey's test with 60-day percent emergence as 
the response variable. Raw data approximated assumptions of equal variance and normality. 
Results and discussion 
Summer seed-bank study 
In untreated samples from 0-10 cm depth in the 102 plots, we identified 53 species at 0-5 cm, 44 species at 5-
10 cm, and 66 species in the whole 0-10 cm. Erigeron divergens was the most frequent species, with 
35% frequency at 0-10 cm depth, followed by Verbascum thapsus (common mullein) at 25% frequency (Table 
3). Seven other species exhibited frequencies [greater than or equal to] 10% at 0-10 cm depth, 
including Gnaphalium exilifolium (slender cudweed), C. geophila, Chamaesyce serpyllifolia (thymeleaf 
sandmat), Muhlenbergia minutissima (annual muhly), Erigeron flagellaris (trailing fleabane), Poa 
pratensis (Kentucky bluegrass), and an unidentified forb. Of the 30 commonest species, 21 (70%) were forbs, 
8 (27%) were grasses, 1 (3%) was a sedge, and none were shrubs or trees. Twelve (40%) of the 
commonest species were annuals, 3 (10%) were biennials, 4 (13%) were annual-perennials, and 10 (33%) 
were perennials, and longevity is unknown for 1 (3%) unidentified forb. Four (13%) of the common species 
were exotic. Although 87% of species were more frequent in the 0-5 cm depth samples than in the 5-10 cm 
depth samples, most species occurred at both depths. 
While little correspondence between seed-bank and aboveground composition has been widely reported for

forest ecosystems (Roberts 1981), our findings indicate that if a species was detected in the seed bank it 
almost always also occurred above ground. For example, E. divergens occurred above ground on 34 of 36 
(94%) plots in which it was detected in the seed bank, more than the 67% expected by chance from 
its aboveground frequency. Poa pratensis occurred above ground on all 10 plots where it occurred in the 
seed bank, M. montana on all 9 plots, and Coreopsis tinctoria (golden tickseed) on all 3 plots. 
Gnaphalium exilifolium was an exception, detected in 13% of seed-bank samples but absent above ground. 
Four dominant aboveground graminoids, including C. geophila, F. arizonica, M. montana, and Poa 
fendleriana (muttongrass), exhibited seed-bank frequencies [greater than or equal to] 2%. Elymus elymoides 
was the most prevalent aboveground species that was sparse in seed banks, occurring above ground in 97% 
of plots but in only 1% of seed-bank samples. This species contains highly viable seeds with no special 
germination requirements, apparently making a persistent seed bank unnecessary for its success (Young and 
Evans 1977). Furthermore, E. elymoides is not predicted to form a persistent mineral-soil seed bank (Thompson 
et al. 1993) because the species has heavy, awned seeds. Its seeds are 2-3 mg heavier than the smooth seeds 
of other local grasses such as P. fendleriana and M. montana that are more common in seed banks. In addition 
to E. elymoides, numerous other important aboveground species, particularly perennial forbs (e.g., T. fendleri, 
L. argenteus), were not detected in seed-bank samples. Congruence of our data with the theory of 
little correspondence between seed-bank and aboveground composition thus depends on whether the focus is 
on the seed bank or on the aboveground vegetation. Species detected in a seed-bank sample were 
frequently detected above ground on that plot (high correspondence), whereas many prominent 
aboveground species were not detected in the seed bank (low correspondence). 
Seed-bank experiments 
Experiments 1 and 2: fire cues and ecosystem types 
Mean emergence density and species richness of seed-bank samples in experiment 1 ranged from 1237 to 
1591 seeds/[m.sup.2] and from 1.6 to 2.1 species/120 [cm.sup.3] (Fig. 1). While emergence from smoke and 
100 [degrees]C heat + liquid smoke samples averaged 265-354 seeds/[m.sup.2] and 0.2-0.5 species/120 
[cm.sup.3] greater than that from control samples, the differences were not significant at p < 0.05 because of 
high variability within treatments (Fig. 1, Table 4). Treatment was significant in experiment 2, with 
emergence after additions of charred P. ponderosa wood averaging 391 seeds/[m.sup.2] fewer than the 
1200 seeds/[m.sup.2] that emerged when charred wood was applied with 100 [degrees]C heat + liquid 
smoke (Fig. 1). Reduced emergence after addition of charred wood contrasts with results obtained by Keeley et 
al. (1985), who found that charred Adenostoma fasciculatum wood in California chaparral significantly 
increased germination of 6 of 12 annuals tested while reducing that of only 1 species, increased germination of 2 
of 6 Phacelia species, and did not affect germination of 4 herbaceous perennials. Our findings agree with those 
of Lodhi and Killingbeck (1982), however, who found that P. ponderosa needles were allelopathic and 
reduced germination of Andropogon gerardii (big bluestem) and Schizachyrium scoparium (little bluestem) in 
North Dakota P. ponderosa forests. While charred wood of species other than P. ponderosa may have 
enhanced emergence in our experiment, this species is the major or only source of woody material across 
the study area.

Experiment 3: fire cues and tree-canopy types 
Multiple heat or liquid smoke applications increased emergence density only in open-canopy plots (Fig. 2). As 
in experiment 1 (Fig. 1), smoke was associated with greater emergence than heat for both canopy types, 
with overall means of 1308 seeds/[m.sup.2] and 2.3 species/120 [cm.sup.3] for smoked samples compared 
with 775 seeds/[m.sup.2] and 1.3 species/120 [cm.sup.3] for heated samples. While heat-stimulated species 
such as Ceanothus fendleri (Fendler's ceanothus) occur in P. ponderosa forests (Huffman 2003), our 
results suggest that smoke promotes community-level seed-bank emergence more strongly than heat, at least 
at the levels of smoke and heat tested in this study. Smoke also induced greater emergence than heat in 
seed banks of an Australian Eucalyptus forest (Read et al. 2000). 
Mean overall emergence was 625 seeds/[m.sup.2] and 1.2 species/120 [cm.sup.3] in dense-canopy 
plots compared with 1458 seeds/[m.sup.2] and 2.4 species/120 [cm.sup.3] in open-canopy plots (Fig. 2). 
Sparsity of mineral-soil seed banks in dense-canopy plots could result from minimal seed inputs because 
of depauperate aboveground vegetation (Harper 1977), reduced seed viability due to burial below allelopathic 
P. ponderosa litter (Lodhi and Killingbeck 1982), or appreciable numbers of undetected seeds in the mineral-
soil samples that could have been trapped in Oi horizons (Strickler and Edgerton 1976). Oi horizons were, 
on average, 3.5 cm thick in dense-canopy plots compared with only 1.9 cm thick in open-canopy plots. 
Consistent with our results, Springer (1999) detected 16 species in seed banks at 0-5 cm depth in open-
canopy plots in P. ponderosa forests near the Grand Canyon, compared with only 7 species in dense plots. 
Experiments 4 and 5: fire-cue effects on samples from densely treed plots 
Although emergence density and species richness in experiment 4 averaged about two times greater in 
smoke samples than in controls, high variability within treatments precluded statistical significance (Fig. 3, 
Table 4). As in experiment 2 with open-canopy plots (Fig. 1), charred wood was associated with low 
emergence density in experiment 5 (Fig. 4). Emergence after exposure to charred wood averaged only 278 
seeds/[m.sup.2], 787 seeds fewer than after 50 [degrees]C heat treatment and at least 324 seeds fewer than 
after any other treatment. Heat and smoke apparently partially counteracted charred wood's negative 
effects, because emergence was greater when heat or smoke was applied with charred wood than when 
charred wood was applied alone. 
Species composition of experimental samples 
We detected a total of 78 species in the experimental samples, including 37 species not detected in the 
summer study. Most of these new species occurred in fewer than three samples each, making it difficult 
to determine if their occurrence was due simply to the additional samples, the cold-storage period, or 
the treatments. For example, the only occurrences of C. fendleri, previously identified as a heat-stimulated 
species (Huffman 2003), were in two samples receiving 100 [degrees]C heat in experiment 2. Nicotiana 
attenuata (coyote tobacco), previously shown to be smoke-stimulated (Baldwin et al. 1994), emerged from 
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/kc355/Desktop/Download%20Document.html (9 of 31) [9/2/2009 12:15:15 PM]

file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/kc355/Desktop/Download%20Document.html
only one sample in experiment 1 (the sample had received smoke). Other new species detected during 
the experiments included P. ponderosa, the exotic Linaria dalmatica (Dalmatian toadflax), and the perennial 
forbs Heliomeris multiflora (showy goldeneye), Hymenoxys bigelovii (Bigelow's rubberweed), Lotus 
wrightii (Wright's deervetch), Oenothera flava ssp. taraxacoides (yellow evening-primrose), Oxytropis 
lambertii (purple locoweed), Potentilla plattensis (Platte River cinquefoil), and Thlaspi montanum 
(alpine pennycress). Common species in the summer study, such as E. divergens, V. thapsus, Nama 
dichotomum (wishbone fiddleleaf), and P. fendleriana, also were the most common overall in the experiments. 
The increase in seed densities observed after smoke additions was caused by overall community-level increases 
in emergence derived from several species. In experiment 1, for example, V. thapsus averaged 126 seeds/
[m.sup.2] in control samples compared with 252 seeds/[m.sup.2] in smoke samples. Similarly, emergence of 
N. dichotomum averaged 290 seeds/[m.sup.2] in control samples and 404 seeds/[m.sup.2] in smoke 
samples. Heliomeris longifolia (longleaf false goldeneye) did not emerge from control samples but averaged 
51 seeds/[m.sup.2] after liquid-smoke additions. Of 40 species detected in control and smoke samples 
in experiment 1, 20 (50%) occurred in both control and smoke samples, 14 (35%) only in smoke samples, and 
6 (15%) only in control samples. Species that emerged from only one treatment, however, tended to have 
low frequencies in that treatment (occurring in fewer than 4 of 33 plots (12%)), making treatment effects on 
these rare species difficult to evaluate. Nevertheless, enhanced emergence of several common species, 
combined with occurrences of more species in smoke samples, resulted in the observed higher overall 
seed densities after smoke additions. 
Summary of experiments 
To summarize the results of these experiments, (i) samples exposed to liquid smoke tended to exhibit 
greater community-level emergence and species richness than controls, although high variability 
precluded statistical significance; (ii) heat had minimal effects and did not interact with smoke; (iii) charred 
P. ponderosa wood reduced emergence, (iv) ecosystem type did not interact with treatment; (v) 
emergence density and species richness were about twice as high in open-canopy plots as in closed-canopy 
plots; and (vi) pinpointing species whose emergence increased or decreased as a result of these factors is 
difficult because many species occurred infrequently. Studying seeds of known species or from known seed 
banks that are expected to contain certain species could help identify species-specific responses (e.g., Ralphs 
and Cronin 1987; Clark and Wilson 1994). 
Known-seed experiment 
In the known-seed experiment, in which heat and liquid-smoke effects were tested for the purpose of 
assessing emergence requirements, E. elymoides exhibited high emergence, 88%-90%, across treatments 
(Table 5), consistent with McDonough (1970), who reported 94%-98% germination of E. elymoides seeds 
collected in Utah. Festuca arizonica emergence also was high across treatments in our experiment, ranging 
from 67% to 79%. The forbs G. caespitosum, L. argenteus, and T. fendleri had lower emergence than the 
grasses, and did not respond significantly to smoke or to 100 [degrees]C heat. Emergence of L. argenteus 
was 37%-56% lower than the 79% emergence of Wyoming seeds under alternating 15 and 25 [degrees]

C temperatures reported by Romme et al. (1995). However,T. fendleri's low emergence, 13%-29%, is 
consistent with Hoffman's (1985) results for Colorado seeds. Penstemon barbatus did respond strongly to 
smoke, its emergence increasing by 44% over the 19% emergence from the control. Keeley and 
Fotheringham (1998) found that aerosol smoke increased germination of Penstemon centranthifolius 
(scarlet bugler) by 30% in California chaparral, suggesting that responses to smoke in Penstemon spp. in 
the southwestern United States may not be uncommon. The results of this experiment indicate that 
greenhouse emergence requirements of these tested species would likely be met if their seeds occurred in 
seed-bank samples. However, only E. elymoides and F. arizonica were detected in our seed-bank 
samples, suggesting that the other tested species do not form persistent seed banks or were not common 
enough to be detected. 
Comparisons among ecosystems and environmental gradients 
Mean emergence density at 0-5 cm depth in the summer study ranged from 417 seeds/[m.sup.2] in xeric 
limestone ecosystems to 3333 seeds/[m.sup.2] in park ecosystems (Fig. 5). For reasons that are not 
clear, however, park ecosystems exhibited the lowest seed density after cold storage when averaged across 
the experiments. Xeric, gravelly black-cinder ecosystems exhibited the third highest seed density in the 
summer study and the highest overall density by more than 600 seeds/[m.sup.2] in the experiments. 
These prominent seed densities resulted from a high abundance of the annuals N. dichotomum, 
Chenopodium graveolens (fetid goosefoot), and M. minutissima. Large variability within ecosystems, 
however, precluded statistical significance (p > 0.05) of most seed-density differences among ecosystem 
types. Measured soil and topographic variables also were not strongly correlated with seed density, with 
Pearson's correlations (r) of, for example, -0.23 with pH, 0.15 with percent gravel, 0.10 with total N, 0.28 
with percent clay, and -0.10 with available soil water. 
Seed-bank composition differentiated more strongly along ecosystem and environmental gradients than did 
seed density but less strongly than did aboveground vegetation (Fig. 6). Seed bank compositional patterns 
were more pronounced if similar ecosystems were grouped, by combining, for example, the black- and red-
cinder ecosystems. While not restricted to the cinder ecosystems, N. dichotomum and M. minutissima were 
most abundant in these sandy ecosystems. Sand content of the upper 15 cm averaged 70% in the 21 plots 
in which N. dichotomum was detected in seed-bank samples, but only 37% in the 45 plots in which this 
species was not detected. Park and clay basalt ecosystems, both exhibiting the most clay at 0-15 cm depth 
(Table 1) and being subjected to heavy grazing (Clary 1975), contained the only seed-bank occurrences of 
C. tinctoria, Gutierrezia sarothrae (broom snakeweed), and O. flava ssp. taraxacoides, and the highest 
abundance of E. divergens. Poa pratensis was most prominent in mesic, N-rich aspen ecosystems, and 7 of the 
11 (64%) plots in which C. geophila was detected in seed-bank samples were from aspen or mesic 
basalt ecosystems. The seed-bank distribution of these species followed environmental gradients that affected 
the distribution of their aboveground vegetation. Other species, such as V. thapsus and G. exilifolium, showed 
little apparent correlation with environmental gradients. Seed deposition of these species was probably 
more closely associated with past disturbances. 
Comparisons with other P. ponderosa studies

Our overall summer study average of 1600 seeds/[m.sup.2] (0-5 cm depth) is greater than previous findings of 
8-22 (Vose and White 1987) and 25-600 seeds/[m.sup.2] (Korb et al. 2004) for 0-5 cm depth samples at 
sites within the study area of our investigation. Seed densities reported from other studies carried out in 
northern Arizona P. ponderosa forests include 1200 seeds/[m.sup.2] (0-5 cm depth) from Springer (1999) 
and 1560, 1263, and 273 seeds/[m.sup.2] (O horizon + 0-5 cm depth) at three sites sampled by Korb et 
al. (2005). Wienk et al. (2004) found that seed banks averaged 186 seeds/[m.sup.2] (O horizon + 0-3 cm 
depth) in a densely treed South Dakota P. ponderosa stand. In a Washington P. ponderosa stand, Pratt et 
al. (1984) recorded densities of 13 000 - 14 000 seeds/[m.sup.2] (litter + 0-10 cm depth), sharply higher than 
our overall 0-10 cm depth average of 2500 seeds/[m.sup.2]. Pratt et al. (1984) noted that their study site 
may have contained elevated seed densities not typical of area forests because of large numbers of exotic 
species at their site and the site's proximity to adjacent grassland communities. Variation in seed densities 
among studies carried out in P. ponderosa forests may be related to differences among study sites in 
disturbance history, overstory characteristics, soil properties, or aboveground plant communities, combined 
with differences in sampling and sample processing. Overall, however, it appears that densities in seed banks at 
0-5 cm depth in southwestern P. ponderosa forests typically average less than 2000 seeds/[m.sup.2]. 
Our detection of 103 species in total emerging from seed-bank samples sharply exceeds the number of 
species detected in previous P. ponderosa studies, which ranged from 3 (Vose and White 1987) to 57 (Pratt et 
al. 1984). The enhanced species detection in our study probably results from a larger number of sampling sites 
and ecosystem types, and to a lesser extent, the experimental treatments used. We detected 18 of 38 
(47%) species uncovered by Springer (1999) in seed banks at Mount Trumbull near the Grand Canyon, 190 
km north of our study area. Dominant seed-bank species detected in both our study and Springer's (1999) 
study include E. divergens, C. serpyllifolia, P. pratensis, V. thapsus, N. dichotomum, M. minutissima, and 
Verbena bracteata (bigbract verbena). Probably reflecting differences in regional species pools, Artemisia 
tridentata (big sagebrush), Collinsia parviflora (maiden blue-eyed Mary), Leonurus cardiaca (common 
motherwort), Viola canadensis (Canadian white violet), and Chenopodium berlandieri (pitseed goosefoot) 
were abundant at Mount Trumbull but were not detected in our study. We detected <10% of the species that 
Pratt et al. (1984) observed, with congruent species mainly including exotics such as V. thapsus, Bromus 
tectorum (cheatgrass), and P. pratensis that Springer (1999) also found. These observations suggest that 
some species may be fairly widespread in seed banks throughout P. ponderosa forests, but substantial 
regional differences in seed-bank composition occur in this widespread forest type. 
Ecological restoration and management implications 
Seed banks are useful in restoration and management if desired species occur in the seed bank and conditions 
that promote their emergence can be created (van der Valk and Pederson 1989). We identified 280 
aboveground species on plots compared with 103 species in seed-bank samples, suggesting that many species 
in the study area do not form persistent seed banks, occurred too infrequently in seed-bank samples to 
be detected, or have emergence requirements that we did not meet (Warr et al. 1993). Species that were 
common above ground, with >40% frequencies in plots, but absent from seed-bank samples, included 
Astragalus humistratus (groundcover milkvetch), Cirsium wheeleri (Wheeler's thistle), Polygonum

douglasii (Douglas' knotweed), Pseudocymopterus montanus (alpine false springparsley), and Vicia 
americana (American vetch). The four perennial forbs in our known-seed experiment (Table 5) also were 
absent from seed-bank samples. Our study concurs with many previous investigations, in which, with 
some exceptions, such as a study by Cohen et al. (2004) in North Carolina Pinus palustris (longleaf pine) 
stands, few perennial forbs have been found in forest seed banks (Honnay et al. 2002). Because many 
perennial forbs also disperse seeds for only short distances (Ehrle'n and van Groenendael 1998), our 
study supports observations that colonization by perennial forbs can be expected to be slow after thinning 
and burning during P. ponderosa forest restoration (Moore et al. 2006). This is likely particularly true in 
densely treed forests containing few aboveground seed sources in existing understory vegetation (Vose and 
White 1987). 
In contrast to the paucity of perennial forbs, many native graminoids, such as M. montana and C. geophila, 
were detected in seed banks of both open- and dense-canopy plots. This may explain why these graminoids 
often initially increase fairly rapidly after thinning and burning (Abella and Covington 2004). Short-lived native 
forbs also were fairly common in our seed-bank samples, suggesting that perennial forbs are likely one of the 
more seed-limited functional groups in these forests (Turnbull et al. 2000). For more rapid establishment 
of perennial forbs than may occur from natural colonization, seeding and outplanting have shown some success 
in P. ponderosa forests (Steed and DeWald 2003; Springer and Laughlin 2004), but have not been 
extensively tested to date. Enhancing on-site seed production and germination, possibly by timely 
grazing reductions or prescribed burning (White et al. 1991; Kinucan and Smeins 1992), also may assist 
recovery of perennial forbs during restoration. 
Smoke was associated with greater emergence from seed-bank samples in our greenhouse 
experiments, suggesting that smoke application (Burne et al. 2003) or prescribed burning might 
enhance emergence from seed banks in P. ponderosa forests. However, our greenhouse findings need to be 
tested in the field. Field responses to smoke could depend on the intensity and season of burning, interactions 
of fire cues with other germination cues (e.g., light and water availability), and the suitability of site conditions 
for seedling establishment. 
The results of our study suggest that during restoration and management on this P. ponderosa landscape, 
seed banks (i) can facilitate establishment of several native graminoids, (ii) supply seeds of short-lived native 
forbs but also of some exotic species, and (iii) may exhibit enhanced emergence after prescribed fire. An 
improved understanding of disturbance history (e.g., grazing, time since major disturbance) and prescribed 
burning (e.g., timing, frequency) effects on seed banks will likely enhance our ability to predict seed-
bank contributions and dynamics during ecological restoration in P. ponderosa forests. The differences that 
we found in seed-bank composition among ecosystem types also suggest that species supplied by seed banks 
for ecological restoration will vary among environmental complexes across the landscape.
