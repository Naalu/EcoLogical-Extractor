Abstract
We applied detailed forest reconstructions measured on broad-scale plot grids to initialize forest simulation modeling in
1880 and modeled spatially explicit changes in canopy fuels (canopy biomass, canopy bulk density, species composition) and
potential ﬁre behavior (crowning index) through 2040, a 160-year period. The study sites spanned a 500-m elevational gradient
from ponderosa pine forest through higher-elevation mixed conifer, aspen, and spruce-ﬁr forests on the North Rim of Grand
Canyon National Park in northern Arizona. The simulations were relatively accurate, as assessed by comparing the simulation
output in the year 2000 with ﬁeld data collected in 1997–2001, because a regionally calibrated simulator was used (Central
Rockies variant of the Forest Vegetation Simulator) and because we added regeneration by species and density in the correct
historical sequence. Canopy biomass increased at all sites, rising an average of 122% at the low-elevation sites and 279% at
the high-elevation sites. The intermediate-elevation site, where mixed conifer vegetation predominated, began with the highest
canopy biomass in 1880 but had the lowest increase through 2040 (39%). Canopy bulk density increased roughly in parallel with
canopy biomass; however, density values were considered less accurate in non-contemporary dates because they were based on
assumptions about canopy volume. Species composition of canopy fuels was consistent at low elevation (ponderosa pine) but
shifted strongly toward mesic species at higher elevations, where ponderosa pine declined in absolute as well as relative terms.
Potential crown ﬁre behavior was assessed with the Nexus model in terms of crowning index (CI), the windspeed required to
sustain active canopy burning. CI values decreased 23–80% over the modeled period. Canopy fuel and CI values were mapped
across the entire North Rim landscape. At a threshold windspeed of 45 km/h, only 6% of the landscape was susceptible to
active crown ﬁre in 1880 but 33% was susceptible by 2000. Implications of the changes over time and space include altered
contemporary habitats and the high likelihood of rapid, broad-scale disturbance by ﬁre. If managers choose to intervene to reduce
canopy fuel mass and continuity, actions should be guided by the distinct ecological attributes of the different forest types.

and costly ﬁres in the Southwest, such as the circa
20,000-ha Cerro Grande ﬁre in New Mexico in 2000.
As increasingly higher thresholds of crown ﬁre are
crossed, understanding the causes and characteristics
of crown ﬁre behavior has become urgent. Of the
elements of the ﬁre environment—weather, topogra-
phy, and fuels—the features that can be modiﬁed by
management are the mass, arrangement, and compo-
sition of fuels across the landscape. Thus information
about vegetation patterns, change over time, and sus-
ceptibility to crown ﬁre is highly useful for designing
management strategies (Flannigan et al., 2000).
Any fuel measurement and ﬁre modeling approach
should be driven by the intended use of the data—from
broad planning purposes to detailed ﬁre behavior
predictions—within the constraints of ﬁnancial re-
sources and technological capabilities (Keane and
Finney, 2003). Landscape fuels have been measured
with a great variety of strategies (Keane et al., 2001).
For example, at a broad scale, Schmidt et al. (2002)
mapped several vegetation and ﬁre regime variables
at 1 km2 resolution across the U.S., basing the veg-
etation maps on a synthesis of existing map data
(e.g., Küchler’s Potential Natural Vegetation map).
At ﬁner scale, Keane et al. (1998, 2000) mapped ﬁre
behavior fuel models (Anderson, 1982) on large land-
scapes in Montana, Idaho, and New Mexico using a
“triplet” of base vegetation characteristics: biophys-
ical setting, cover type (species composition), and
structural stage (vertical stand structure). The cou-
pling of fuel data with vegetation simulation and ﬁre
behavior models provides an even broader array of
approaches for modeling successional change, ﬁre
ignition, and ﬁre spread. Rupp et al. (2001) classiﬁed
landscape-ﬁre-succession models along gradients of
increasing complexity, from pathway or Markovian
models with very generalized descriptions of plant
communities to highly speciﬁc individual-plant and
gap-phase models. Keane et al. (1999) integrated a
detailed mechanistic biogeochemical process model,
FireBGC, with a spatially explicit ﬁre behavior
model, FARSITE (Finney, 1998), to link changes in
climate with changes in ﬁre regimes. The accuracy of
long-term simulation may be easier to assess when
dynamics are modeled retrospectively as well as into
the future (Fuhlendorf et al., 1996). Stochastic sim-
ulation approaches, such as those used by He and
Mladenoff (1999) in Wisconsin or Miller and Urban
(2000) in the Sierra Nevada, provide less precision
about individual events but offer more realistic prob-
ability distributions about long-term change.
The Southwest is a microcosm of the variabil-
ity in forests and ﬁre regimes found throughout
North America but forest types adapted to frequent
surface-ﬁre regimes predominate. Ponderosa pine and
lower mixed conifer forests make up approximately
2,950,000 ha in Arizona and New Mexico (O’Brien,
2002; Fiedler et al., 2002). These vegetation types
comprise 86% of the high-elevation, non-woodland
forests in Arizona (O’Brien, 2002). About 90% of
these forest types in New Mexico are considered at
moderate or high risk for stand-replacing ﬁre (Fiedler
et al., 2002), due to increased stand density and
fuel accumulation following ﬁre exclusion and other
management interventions (Covington and Moore,
1994). The higher-elevation forest types, such as
mixed conifer, aspen, and spruce-ﬁr stands, are rare
but important habitats, comprising only about 3% of
Arizona’s forests (O’Brien, 2002). Although rarely
studied, these forests are believed to include a mix of
surface and stand-replacing ﬁre regimes (White and
Vankat, 1993; Grissino-Mayer et al., 1995; Rollins
et al., 2002; Fulé et al., 2003b). There is some evidence
that recent successional changes in the ﬁre exclusion
period may be leading to compositional change (loss
of aspen and meadows; Dahms and Geils, 1997) and
fuel accumulations (White and Vankat, 1993; Fulé
et al., 2003b).
The challenge for landscape management is to select
the appropriate data and tools for modeling ecological
change, then integrating process modeling with land-
scape pattern (Opdam et al., 2002). We reconstructed
key fuel and ﬁre behavior variables on a large south-
western landscape crossing a 500-m elevation gra-
dient that encompassed forest types from ponderosa
pine and mixed conifer to spruce-ﬁr and aspen. We
took advantage of detailed forest data collected on
landscape-scale plot grids in a large, never-harvested
forest at Grand Canyon National Park. The study ob-
jectives were to use a regionally-speciﬁc vegetation
simulator and a ﬁre behavior model to: (1) estimate
the changes in canopy fuels across the sampled land-
scapes over time, from 1880 through the present and
near future (2040); (2) estimate changes in the poten-
tial for crown ﬁre behavior over time and space; and
(3) assess ecological and management implications.

2. Methods
2.1. Study area
The study area was a 6-km × 18-km transect on
the Kaibab Plateau, the North Rim of the Grand
Canyon, in northern Arizona. A series of study sites
was arranged along an elevational gradient from Pow-
ell Plateau (approximately 2300 m elevation) up to
the highest elevation in Grand Canyon National Park
(2794 m in the Little Park East study site), compris-
ing a total of 5345 ha. The forest structures and ﬁre
regimes at the study sites were described in detail by
Fulé et al. (2002, 2003a, b).
Average annual precipitation at the North Rim
ranger station (elevation 2542 m) is 58 cm, with an
average annual snowfall of 328 cm. Temperatures
range from an average July maximum of 26 ◦C to
an average January minimum of −2 ◦C (White and
Vankat, 1993). Soils were derived from Kaibab lime-
stone; soil textures ranged from coarse to ﬁne loams
(A. Dewall, National Resource Conservation Service,
personal communication, 2002).
Forests in the western study sites were domi-
nated by ponderosa pine with Gambel oak and New
Mexican locust (scientiﬁc names and species codes
are given in Table 1). At intermediate elevation
(Swamp Ridge study site, approximately 2500 m),
tree species included ponderosa pine, aspen, white ﬁr,
and Douglas-ﬁr. At the highest elevation sites, Little
Park West and Little Park East, tree species included
ponderosa pine, aspen, white ﬁr, subalpine ﬁr, and
spruces. Engelmann and blue spruce were combined
in this study because of difﬁculties in distinguishing

2.2. Image classiﬁcation
Image classiﬁcation was described in detail by
Crouse and Fulé (2003) and is summarized here.
We used a Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper
(ETM+) image, acquired 6 June 2000. TM imagery
has been shown to be the best product for consistently
mapping vegetation for large land areas (Keane et al.,
2000). Image classiﬁcation and analysis was done
using Erdas Imagine (Leica Geosystems AG, Switzer-
land). Field plot data (166 plots, described below)
collected from 1997 to 2002 were used as training
sites for classiﬁcation. The classiﬁcation scheme was
developed within the National Vegetation Classiﬁca-
tion Standards (NVCS) framework (USGS, 2000).
The species label for each training site was based on
“importance value” (Taylor, 2000), the sum of the
relative frequency (percent stems) and relative abun-
dance (percent basal area) for each species. Forest
types were classiﬁed into four types: (1) aspen, (2)
mixed conifer (sites where importance values were
dominated by white ﬁr or Douglas-ﬁr), (3) ponderosa
pine, and (4) spruce-ﬁr. The two non-forest types were
(1) grass, and (2) burn. The “burn” category was the
Outlet Fire of 2000, a 5260-ha stand-replacing ﬁre.
A classiﬁcation using a minimum distance algo-
rithm was run using the combined training site sig-
nature set. The classiﬁed image was checked using
aerial photographs (National High Altitude Photog-
raphy program 1:40,000 color infrared prints) and

234

individuals familiar with the area assisted in reﬁning
the classiﬁcation. Misclassed pixels were identiﬁed us-
ing an elevation-based model developed in Imagine.
For example, vegetation types such as spruce do not
occur at the lower elevations of the study area. The
model “ﬂagged” this vegetation type if it occurred be-
low 2250 m. These pixels were then edited to reﬂect
the correct vegetation type. Veriﬁcation against an in-
dependent data set of 86 ﬁre monitoring plots showed
an overall classiﬁcation accuracy of 74.7%.
2.3. Forest measurements
Vegetation was measured on plots based on the Na-
tional Park Service’s Fire Monitoring plots (Reeberg,
1995), with modiﬁcations to collect detailed tree con-
dition and dendroecological data. This plot design was
chosen to correspond with NPS monitoring and be-
cause the relatively large plots are useful for cap-
turing variability of clumps of old trees (Fulé et al.,
1997). A total of 166 plots was measured between
1998 and 2001 (Fig. 1). Sampling plots were 0.1 ha
(20 m × 50 m) in size, oriented with the 50-m sides
uphill-downhill to maximize sampling of variability
along the elevational gradient and to permit correc-
tion of the plot area for slope. Plots were permanently
marked with iron stakes were sunk ﬂush to the for-
est ﬂoor at the corners and center of each plot and a
large tree was tagged with the distance and bearing to
Fig. 1. Study sites on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona. From west to east, sites are Powell Plateau (PP), Fire Point
(FP), Rainbow Plateau (RP), Swamp Ridge (SR), Little Park West (LPW) and Little Park East (LPE). Forest structure and ﬁre regimes of
the ﬁrst four sites were described by Ful´e et al. (2002, 2003a). The Little Park area is described in Ful´e et al. (2003b). The dots at each
study site represent the locations of permanent plots. Each plot is 20 m × 50 m in size.
the plot center. Photos were taken at the corners and
quarter-corners of each plot.
Trees larger than 15 cm diameter at breast height
(dbh) were measured on the entire plot (1000 m2)
and trees between 2.5 and 15 cm dbh were measured
on one quarter-plot (250 m2); all trees were tagged.
Tree attributes measured were: species, dbh, height,
crown base height, dwarf mistletoe rating (0–6;
Hawksworth and Geils, 1990), and tree condition. To
assess changes in forest structure, we differentiated
between trees established prior to 1880 and those that
established later. Previous research in northern Ari-
zona showed that ponderosa pines with dbh >37.5 cm
or ponderosa of any size with yellowed bark could
be conservatively identiﬁed in the ﬁeld as being of
pre-1880 origin (White, 1985; Mast et al., 1999). We
used the same diameter breakpoint, 37.5 cm, for other
conifers and >20 cm for aspen trees (Fulé et al., 2002).
“Conservative” identiﬁcation meant that these crite-
ria included all pre-1880 trees as well as numerous
post-1880 trees. Tree status (pre/post 1880) was later
corrected in the laboratory using age data. All living
trees meeting the ﬁeld criteria above were considered
potentially pre-1880 trees and were cored at 40 cm
above ground level. A random 10% sample of all trees
that did not meet the ﬁeld criteria was also cored.
Seedling trees, those below 2.5 cm dbh, were tallied
by species, condition, and height class in a 50 m2 sub-
plot. Canopy cover measured by vertical projection

(Ganey and Block, 1994) was recorded at 30 cm in-
tervals along the two 50-m sidelines of each plot.
Forest plot area was corrected for slope by multiply-
ing the 50-m dimension by the slope correction fac-
tor. Tree increment cores were surfaced and visually
crossdated (Stokes and Smiley, 1968) with tree-ring
chronologies we developed. Rings were counted on
cores that could not be crossdated, especially younger
trees. Additional years to the center were estimated
with a pith locator (concentric circles matched to the
curvature and density of the inner rings) for cores that
missed the pith (Applequist, 1958). From previous
studies (Fulé et al., 2002, 2003a, b), we know that ﬁre
exclusion began after 1879 on most of the North Rim.
Forest structure in 1880 was reconstructed using den-
droecological methods (Fulé et al., 1997, 2002, 2003b)
as follows: tree size at the time of ﬁre exclusion was
reconstructed by subtracting the radial growth mea-
sured on increment cores since 1879. We developed
local species-speciﬁc relationships between tree diam-
eter and basal area increment (r2 = 0.45–0.90) and
applied these relationships to estimate past size for

trees without increment cores (dead or rotten centers).
For dead trees, the date of death was estimated based
on tree condition class using diameter-dependent snag
decomposition rates (Thomas et al., 1979).
2.4. Modeling and canopy fuels
A schematic diagram of the modeling process is
shown in Fig. 2, leading from plot data to modeling
of vegetation change and ﬁre behavior. Forest change
was simulated on a per-plot basis at 10-year inter-
vals using the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS, Van
Dyck, 2000), Central Rockies variant. FVS is a sta-
tistical model of forest growth, originally developed
in the northern Rocky Mountains and expanded to
serve as a nationwide platform for U.S. Forest Service
simulation. The speciﬁc growth and yield model for
the Central Rockies variant was largely developed in
northern Arizona, close to the site of the present study.
We chose this model because it is a highly precise and
site-speciﬁc statistical model for short-term simulation
of forest change (Edminster et al., 1991), realistically

236
P.Z. Ful´e et al. / Ecological Modelling 175 (2004) 231–248
simulating the speciﬁc 160-year period under study,
in contrast to a long-term ecological process modeling
approach (e.g., Keane et al., 2002) that could provide
a broader but less precise range of outputs. Simula-
tions were initialized with reconstructed 1880 condi-
tions. Actual regeneration data by species and decade
were added to each plot. Regeneration densities were
increased by 40%, an empirically determined value, to
account for density-dependent mortality. For example,
if data for a given plot showed that 10 ponderosa pine
trees established between 1880 and 1890, then we in-
serted 14 trees (140%) into the simulation year 1890.
Simulations were run until 2040. Simulation data at
the year 2000 were checked against ﬁeld plot data that
were collected between 1998 and 2002. The simula-
tion values were within ±20% of ﬁeld values for tree
density (trees per hectare) and basal area.
Tree lists were exported from FVS for each plot
and decade. Canopy biomass was estimated with
dbh-based allometric equations for foliage and ﬁne
twigs, the canopy fuels that are available for burning
in crown ﬁres (Scott and Reinhardt, 2001). Allo-
metric equations developed in or near the Southwest
were selected as follows: ponderosa pine (Fulé et al.,
2001a), Gambel oak (Clary and Tiedemann, 1986),
juniper (Grier et al., 1992), white ﬁr (Westman, 1987),
Douglas-ﬁr (Gower et al., 1992), and equations com-
piled by Ter-Mikaelian and Korzuhkin (1997) were
used for aspen, subalpine ﬁr, and Engelmann spruce.
Canopy volume was estimated on a per-plot basis
by the maximum tree height (top of the canopy) minus
crown base height (bottom of the canopy). We used
maximum tree height per plot as a proxy for “dom-
inant height” (Research Working Group #2, 1999),
the average height of dominant and co-dominant
trees. Even though the tallest tree on each plot was
used, the measurement is not equivalent to “predom-
inant height” (the tallest trees in the stand; Research
Working Group #2, 1999), because the tallest trees
in the stand were not evenly captured on the plots.
Therefore, the top of canopy measured by our method
fell in the upper portion of the tree height distribution
but not at the maximum. For example, the average
maximum height of PIPO trees on a per-plot basis was
28.2 m, a value equivalent to the 85th percentile of
the distribution of all PIPO tree heights. The bottom
of the canopy can also be measured in varying ways
(Scott and Reinhardt, 2001). In previous studies where
we explored stand vulnerability to torching, we used
the lowest quintile value (Fulé et al., 2001a). In the
present study, however, the uncertainty of estimating
long-term characteristics of crown base height were
high so we chose a simple average and did not at-
tempt to model torching. Plots measured before 1999
had a single average crown base height value per plot.
From 1999 onward (sites LPW and LPE), crown base
heights were measured per tree and the average was
used for the plot value. Canopy bulk density was cal-
culated as canopy biomass divided by canopy volume.
Fire behavior was modeled with the Nexus Fire
Behavior and Hazard Assessment System (Scott
and Reinhardt, 2001). Nexus integrates a determin-
istic semi-empirical model of surface ﬁre behavior
(Rothermel, 1972) with models of crown ﬁre tran-
sition (Van Wagner, 1977) and crown ﬁre spread
(Rothermel, 1991). Nexus required inputs of canopy
biomass and bulk density, as described above. Foliar
moisture content was set at 100% (Agee et al., 2002).
Field measurements of plot slope were used. Hot and
dry weather inputs were used to simulate ﬁre behav-
ior under extreme conditions. Fire weather extremes
representing the 90th and 97th percentiles of low fuel
moisture and high temperature were calculated for
1970–2001 at the Bright Angel weather station (North
Rim, Grand Canyon National Park, elevation 2560 m)
using the FireFamily Plus program (Bradshaw and
Brittain, 1999), a statistical software package de-
signed to analyze distributions of ﬁre-related weather
variables. Values were calculated for June, historically
the month with the most severe ﬁre weather (Table 2).

The 90th and 97th percentiles are shown for the month of June
(7-day analysis periods), historically the month with the most

ﬁre behavior analysis. “1 H” refers to 1-h timelag fuels, “10 H” to
10-h timelag, etc. (Anderson, 1982). Foliar moisture content was
set to 100% (Agee et al., 2002).

Fire behavior fuel models (Anderson, 1982) used
were 9 (sites below 2500 m elevation) and 10 (sites
above 2500 m elevation). Fuel models are mathemat-
ical summaries of key input variables for the surface
ﬁre behavior model in Nexus, such as bulk density
and surface-area-to-volume ratios.
A variety of ﬁre behavior outputs are provided by
Nexus, including both surface and crown ﬁre behav-
ior variables. As discussed below (see Data Reliabil-
ity), our assumptions about past values of crown base
height and fuel model would have heavily inﬂuenced
interpretation of other ﬁre behavior variables such as
ﬂame length or torching index (windspeed required for
passive crown ﬁre). Therefore we focused on crown
ﬁre behavior as measured by a more reliable variable,
the crowning index (CI), deﬁned as the windspeed at
which active canopy burning could be sustained (Scott
and Reinhardt, 2001).
The variables of canopy biomass, canopy bulk den-
sity, and crowning index were mapped to the plot co-
ordinates. Landscape patterns of these variables at the
six study sites were estimated using negative exponen-
tial interpolation between plots. We also attempted to
model CI on the entire North Rim landscape by look-
ing for relationships between CI and slope, azimuth,
elevation, and canopy cover within each vegetation
type. Although some of the correlations between vari-
ables were statistically signiﬁcant at an alpha level
of 0.05, the predictive capabilities were very low
(r2 < 0.1) so these models were not used. Similar
difﬁculties in relating fuel or ﬁre characteristics to
topographic factors or environmental gradients have
been reported in other fuel modeling studies (Keane
et al., 2000). Instead, we reclassiﬁed the image using
the 1880 and 2000 CI values as training sites. The
classiﬁcation gave realistic outputs but the accuracy
of the map, based on linked model results, cannot be
quantiﬁed.
3. Results
3.1. Changes in canopy fuels, 1880–2040
Canopy biomass increased at all study sites be-
tween 1880 and 2040, but the changes were most
dramatic at the high-elevation LPW and LPE sites
(Fig. 3, see Fig. 1 for site names). At the three
lower-elevation sites, PP, FP, and RP, canopy biomass
ranged from 3800 to 5600 kg/ha in 1880 (mean
4473 kg/ha). By 2040, canopy biomass ranged from
8510 to 9940 kg/ha (mean 9022 kg/ha), an average in-
crease of 122%. The higher-elevation sites LPW and
LPE also had low canopy biomass values in 1880,
3800 and 4400 kg/ha, respectively. But by 2040, LPW
canopy biomass increased to 14,270 kg/ha and LPE
canopy biomass rose to 16,800 kg/ha, an average in-
crease of 279%. The intermediate-elevation site, SR,
had the highest 1880 canopy biomass (8370 kg/ha)
but increased by the smallest proportion of any study
site, only 39%, to a value of 11,700 kg/ha in 2040.
Species composition changes differed by elevation.
At the three low-elevation sites, almost all of the
canopy biomass (>99%) consisted of ponderosa pine
throughout the simulated 160-year period. But the pro-
portion of ponderosa pine canopy biomass declined
at the higher sites. In the intermediate-elevation SR
site, at approximately 2500 m elevation, the canopy
biomass contribution from non-pine species (white
ﬁr, Douglas-ﬁr, and aspen) increased from 31% in
1880 to 61% in 2040. At site LPW, approximately
2650 m elevation, the non-pine component rose from
65% in 1880 to 86% in 2040. Engelmann spruce
and subalpine ﬁr alone made up 50% of total canopy
biomass by 2040, rising from only 19% in 1880. The
highest site, LPE, approximately 2700 m elevation,
started with 86% non-pine canopy biomass in 1880
and increased to 96%. Engelmann spruce and sub-
alpine ﬁr alone made up 36% of total canopy biomass
in 1880 and 67% in 2040.
The changes in canopy biomass were interpolated
across the landscape of the study sites at 60-year in-
tervals (1880, 1940, and 2000) (Fig. 4). In 1880, the
entire landscape had relatively low canopy biomass
values, with the highest values at mid-elevation (SR).
By 1940, however, higher canopy biomass values
appeared in LPW and LPE, a pattern that became
stronger with time. By 2000, heavy crown fuels cov-
ered about 2/3 of the LPE site.
Canopy bulk density values closely paralleled
canopy biomass values (Fig. 5), as expected, but
with minor variation due to plot-to-plot differences in
canopy volume. The increases in canopy bulk density
ranged from 34% (SR) to 291% (LPE) (Table 3).
Summarized by vegetation type rather than by study
site, the spruce-ﬁr type had the highest increase

In 1880, the absolute values of canopy bulk density
were below 0.05 kg/m3 in every vegetation type and
every study site except SR. The canopy bulk density
value of 0.05 kg/m3 is not necessarily a threshold for
crown ﬁre behavior (see comments below on alter-
native methods of canopy bulk density calculation),
but values of 0.05 kg/m3 or higher have been associ-
ated with passive or active crown ﬁre in other studies
using Nexus in southwestern forests (Fulé et al.,
2001a, 2001b). By 1960, all vegetation types and all
study sites except the lowest elevation sites (PP and
RP) had canopy bulk density >0.05 kg/m3. By 2040,
four of the six study sites and three of the four veg-
etation types had canopy bulk density >0.07 kg/m3
(Table 3).

55–71 km/h (average 65 km/h) in 2040, a decrease
of 49%. CI values at the intermediate-elevation site,
SR, dropped from 62 to 48 km/h between 1880 and
2040, a 23% decline. At the higher-elevation sites,
LPW and LPE, CI values were extremely high in
1880: 272 and 371 km/h, respectively. By 2040, the
CI dropped to 54 km/h at LPW (80% decline) and to
52 km/h at LPE (86% decline). Approximately half of
the SR study site and 1/3 of the LPW and LPE study
sites were susceptible to crown ﬁre at windspeeds of

more are common as gusts and occasionally as sus-
tained winds in northern Arizona during severe ﬁres
(McCoy, 1996).
Modeled across the entire North Rim, 33% of the
landscape was susceptible to crown ﬁre at a windspeed
threshold of 45 km/h in 2000, compared to less than
6% in 1880 (Fig. 7). Both in 1880 and 2000, the lowest
values of CI were clustered in mixed conifer forests
located just above the ponderosa forests on the canyon
rim. By 2000, many higher-elevation spruce ﬁr forests

at the center of the plateau were also susceptible, as
well as linear spruce-ﬁr stands located on north slopes
of drainages.
4. Discussion
4.1. Data reliability
Model results should always be used with caution
and accuracy is important in any study modeling eco-
logical characteristics over time and space. The most
accurate data were the direct measurements on the
ﬁeld plots, providing contemporary values of tree den-
sity and size by species. The accuracy of the forest
reconstructions at these sites was compared in de-
tail by Fulé et al. (2002, 2003b) to multiple lines
of evidence from a historical inventory (Lang and
Stewart, 1910), other historical accounts (e.g., Dutton,
1882), and ecological data (e.g., Rasmussen, 1941;
Mitchell and Freeman, 1993). Reconstructed forest
structure matched closely with the earliest inventory
data: forest density was within 5–10% of the historical
data, similar to the historical distribution by species in
multi-species sites (Fulé et al., 2002, 2003b). We ex-
pected vegetation simulation to be relatively accurate
because we chose a local statistical model, the Cen-
tral Rockies variant of the FVS, and because we input
plot-speciﬁc data on regeneration density by year and
species. This expectation was borne out by the fact
that simulated densities and basal areas in 2000 were
within ±20% of ﬁeld-measured values. The tradeoff
for precision, however, was that the simulation model
lacked process relationships to explore the potential
ecological effects of changing climate and disturbance
regimes (e.g., Peng and Apps, 1999). Therefore we
limited future projections to the near term, the next 40
years.
Canopy biomass was estimated with published
regression equations with high predictive capability
(r2 = 0.8–0.9) and local equations were selected
whenever possible, indicating that canopy biomass
changes over time should be relatively accurate. How-
ever, the calculation of canopy bulk density required
assumptions about canopy volume. We calculated
canopy volume from the top (height) and bottom
(crown base height) of the contemporary plots and as-
sumed the same volume for all simulated decades. An
alternative choice would have been to use FVS height
and crown ratio estimates to estimate canopy volume.
However, while FVS was accurate in simulating tree
numbers and diameters, we found many inconsisten-
cies in height even though sites were initialized with
local site index data. Most importantly, all living trees
always grew substantially in height in FVS model-
ing, leading to modeled heights in 2000 that were
higher than measured heights and continuous expan-
sion of canopy volume over time. Since most plots
were dominated by mature trees at the outset, this
approach would have been problematic. Finally, since
we used an independent set of diameter-based allo-
metric biomass equations, rather than FVS-modeled
crown fuel values, there is no inherent linkage be-
tween models of tree height and canopy biomass. Our
use of contemporary canopy volume measurements
has two implications. First, it meant that current
canopy bulk density estimates (e.g., 1980–2020) were
probably more accurate than distant estimates (e.g.,
1880–1920). In particular, canopy bulk density was
most likely underestimated in early decades in the
regenerating stands at high elevation (sites LPW and
LPE, Fig. 5). Although canopy biomass was very low
on many of those plots due to severe ﬁres, especially
in 1879 (Fulé et al., 2003b), canopy volume would
also have been lower due to the small stature of the
young trees. Furthermore, the dates of stand-replacing
ﬁres varied widely and past ﬁre severity was highly
mixed (Fulé et al., 2003b), so taller surviving trees
were commonly in close proximity to stand-replacing
ﬁre patches. Second, the fact that we were not able to
estimate crown base height in the past or future led
us to remove torching index (windspeed required for
passive crown ﬁre) from the ﬁre behavior analysis, be-
cause simulated torching is highly sensitive to crown
base height (Scott and Reinhardt, 2001). However,
by basing our canopy volume estimates on measured
rather than modeled values, the comparisons over
time are relatively realistic and consistent.
The use of allometric canopy biomass equations
produces estimates that are approximately 40–60%
lower than the canopy bulk density values based on
the data of Brown (1978). For example, the “high
cover” mesic mixed conifer stands in the Gila Na-
tional Forest (New Mexico) were estimated to have
canopy bulk density values of 0.25 kg/m3 (Keane et al.,
2000), in contrast to maximum values of 0.094 kg/m3

244
P.Z. Ful´e et al. / Ecological Modelling 175 (2004) 231–248
in the present study (62% lower). Therefore compar-
isons of canopy bulk density values across studies
that used different methods should be based on rela-
tive, not absolute, differences. The FARSITE model
(Finney, 1998) is calibrated to accept higher canopy
bulk density values, while the Nexus model (Scott and
Reinhardt, 2001) used in the present study provides
realistic crown ﬁre behavior estimates with the lower
canopy bulk density values (E. Reinhardt, personal
communication, 2003).
The assumptions and uncertainties associated with
ﬁre behavior modeling have been discussed elsewhere
(Van Wagner, 1977; Rothermel, 1991; Finney, 1998;
Scott, 1998; Scott and Reinhardt, 2001). Our objective
was not to improve upon existing models but rather to
use the Nexus model with detailed local data to de-
velop a fair comparison of potential ﬁre behavior in
relative terms. Thus it would be unrealistic to expect
that CI values are precise estimates of the exact wind-
speed at which any real crown ﬁre will be sustained.
However, it is reasonable to compare CI values across
space and time to assess crown ﬁre susceptibility in
relative terms.
Spatial patterns were relatively consistent between
sites and decades (Figs. 4–6) because sampling was
done on regular grids, a strategy for minimizing in-
terpolation error. Spatial accuracy was high at each
mapped plot (within the ±15 m accuracy of hand-
held global positioning system units) and unknown
between plots. However, the same interpolation pro-
cedures were used for each map, so comparisons be-
tween maps are consistent.
4.2. Ecological implications
Substantial changes in forest composition, structure,
and susceptibility to ﬁre occurred over the large land-
scapes of the study sites since 1880 and similar trends
are forecast for the next few decades, barring distur-
bance or management intervention. At sites ≥2500 m
elevation, the majority of the increases occurred in
mesic species, reversing in a century the 10,000-year
trend of upward movement of xeric species on the
Kaibab Plateau (Weng and Jackson, 1999). Future dis-
turbances are likely to be widespread and severe in
terms of tree mortality, whether from ﬁre or biologi-
cal pathogens, especially if inﬂuenced by warmer and
drier climate (Flannigan et al., 2000).
The western ponderosa pine sites (PP, FP, and RP)
were described by Fulé et al. (2002, 2003a) as rare
examples of unharvested forests with relatively undis-
rupted surface ﬁre regimes. Each of these sites had
two or three large surface ﬁres after 1879 and several
smaller ﬁres (Fulé et al., 2003a). Forest structural
change as measured by basal area was relatively low
at these sites, rising from an average of 18.5 m2/ha in
1880 to 28.3 m2/ha at present; this 53% increase in
basal area was much less than the 152% increase ob-
served in another unharvested ponderosa forest where
ﬁre was completely excluded on the South Rim of
Grand Canyon (Fulé et al., 2002). The western sites
remain relatively open, 193–249 pines/ha (Fulé et al.,
2002), compared to an Arizona-wide average in 1999
of approximately 618 pines/ha (O’Brien, 2002), and
arguably present a relatively low fuel hazard due to the
dominance of tall, old, ﬁre-pruned trees. Nonetheless,
even these relatively natural forests have increased in
canopy fuel loading, perhaps reﬂecting an intermedi-
ate effect of the reduced, but not eliminated, surface
ﬁre regime.
At the higher elevation sites, shifts in species com-
position were as notable as the increase in canopy
biomass. In every case, ﬁre-resistant ponderosa pine
declined in relative terms, as has been observed in
other mixed conifer settings in the absence of ﬁre (e.g.,
Minnich et al., 1995; Stephenson, 1999). The absolute
value of ponderosa pine biomass was also estimated to
decline, as early as 1940 at the intermediate-elevation
SR site and after 1960 at the higher sites (Fig. 3).
Douglas-ﬁr, a species with intermediate ﬁre resistance
(relatively susceptible as a seedling but resistant when
mature (Miller, 2000)), retained a relatively consis-
tent proportion of canopy biomass (Fig. 3). The ma-
jor increases in canopy biomass occurred in white ﬁr
(Fig. 3), subalpine ﬁr, and spruce (Fig. 3), relatively
ﬁre-susceptible species.
Habitat changes associated with forest alteration in-
clude the decline of early-successional environments
at high elevation. Approximately 60% of the LPW
and LPE landscapes were initiated by stand-replacing
ﬁre between 1782 and 1879 (Fulé et al., 2003b),
creating open forests with abundant snags. These
conditions may be important for bird diversity in
general and especially for certain guilds such as
woodpeckers, ﬂycatchers, and seedeaters (Hutto,
1995).

Changes in composition of mixed stands affect
potential ﬁre behavior in several ways. First, since
1880 surface fuels have become increasingly com-
prised of relatively more tree litter and relatively less
herbaceous fuels, tending to reduce ﬁre rate of spread
but to increase surface heating (Anderson, 1982).
Second, the proportion of long-needled ponderosa
pine litter, a resinous and loosely compacted fuel,
has declined relative to short-needled conifer litter
(Douglas-ﬁr, spruce, and ﬁr) that is less ﬂammable
and more compacted, tending to reduce both rate of
spread and surface heating. However, the presence of
numerous jackstrawed fallen logs in mixed conifer
and spruce-ﬁr stands (P.Z. Fulé, unpublished data),
lead us to select fuel model 10 (“light logging slash,”
Anderson, 1982) for modeling. In terms of crown ﬁre
behavior, the historical shift toward mesic species is
likely to have lowered crown base heights because
spruce and ﬁrs have relatively long crowns (Miller,
2000), facilitating crown ﬁre initiation.
Aspen, the only deciduous species at high elevation,
formed a very small fraction of canopy biomass (<3%)
at any site or date. In part this is due to differences in
tree architecture, with aspen bearing relatively fewer
and lighter-mass leaves high in the canopy compared
to the longer crowns and denser leaves of conifers.
The absence of ﬁre after 1879 probably reduced as-
pen regeneration but a greater impact may have been
selective herbivory by deer during the early twenti-
eth century (Adams, 1925; Rasmussen, 1941; Mitchell
and Freeman, 1993). Aspen regeneration occurred to
some extent on the study sites even in the absence of
ﬁre, but a large demographic gap was observed cor-
responding with the period of high deer populations
(Fulé et al., 2002, 2003b). If aspen comprised a rel-
atively higher proportion of contemporary forest fu-
els, crown ﬁre hazard would have been reduced (lower
canopy bulk density and high crown base height) and
surface ﬁre behavior would have been characterized
by reduced rate of spread and intensity (Hély et al.,
2000).
4.3. Management implications
National Park management in the U.S. is oriented
toward restoration of keystone natural processes,
such as ﬁre, as an integral part of conserving natural
ecosystems (e.g., Parsons and Van Wagtendonk, 1996;
Stephenson, 1999). Grand Canyon National Park ﬁre
management policy is to restore the natural process of
ﬁre disturbance “to effectively manage wildland ﬁre
and provide for the protection of life, property, and
cultural resources, while ensuring the perpetuation
of park ecosystems and natural resources” (Grand
Canyon National Park, 1992, p. 57).
The increasingly dense and connected crown fuels
of the North Rim have been capable of supporting
broad-scale crown ﬁre for several decades, as evi-
denced by the severe ﬁres of recent years. But the
differences in ﬁre ecology and historical variability
across the elevational gradient should be reﬂected
in distinct management goals and actions for the
different forest types at low, mid, and high eleva-
tion. In the ponderosa pine-dominated sites at low
elevation, canopy fuels have increased substantially
since 1880 but remain lower than in the other forest
types. Managers could choose to encourage wild-
land ﬁres to burn for resource beneﬁts, supplemented
by management-ignited ﬁres, to maintain or restore
a frequent surface regime. The data in the present
study suggest that even if burns resulted in substan-
tial reduction in canopy biomass, up to 40–50%, the
resulting forest conditions could still be within the
range of historical conditions if older trees tended to
survive. In a study conducted in high-elevation forests
adjacent to the LPE study site, White and Vankat
(1993) suggested that fuels had become more homo-
geneous over the past century, presenting a threat of
larger crown ﬁres. The results of the present study
support this assessment. However, management plan-
ning could balance recognition of the increase in ﬁre
hazard simultaneously with the perspective that severe
ﬁres have an ecological role in the high-elevation ﬁre
types. If this ecological role were explicitly addressed
in management plans and environmental documen-
tation, then at least some high-elevation crown ﬁres
might be managed more appropriately as natural dis-
turbances rather than being treated as catastrophes that
require costly and often futile wildﬁre suppression
efforts.
Mid-elevation mixed conifer forests present the
greatest management challenge. These forests had
the highest historical and contemporary canopy bulk
density (Table 3) but had a regime of frequent surface
ﬁres before 1880 (Fulé et al., 2003a). Tree groups
in only 20% (3 of 15) mixed conifer plots in the

246
P.Z. Ful´e et al. / Ecological Modelling 175 (2004) 231–248
LP study sites were initiated by stand-replacing ﬁre
(Fulé et al., 2003b). Alternatives include testing tree
thinning treatments (Grand Canyon National Park,
2002), especially where strategically located to try
to intercept crown ﬁres (Finney, 2000), and using
relatively severe burning as suggested by Miller
and Urban (2000) to rapidly restore historical con-
ditions by preferentially killing ﬁre-susceptible tree
species and smaller trees. Severe prescribed burns
would not be simple to execute but there is evi-
dence from the 1993 NWIII ﬁre, adjacent to the
SR study site, that forest composition and density
were reduced to historical levels while maintain-
ing a native herbaceous understory (Fulé et al.,
in press).
The changes in fuel mass, composition, and spa-
tial arrangement across the North Rim landscape
are large in both relative and absolute terms. The
rise in canopy fuels is consistent with the growing
scale of crown ﬁres in the Southwest and similar dry
forests across the western U.S. In the lower-elevation
forests, large-scale stand-replacing ﬁres appear to
be a novel disturbance regime with uncertain suc-
cessional outcomes (Mast and Savage, 2003). Even
though crown ﬁre plays an important ecological
role in many of the higher-elevation forest types,
it may be argued that the high ﬁre susceptibility
across the contemporary landscape has also crossed
a threshold to represent a novel condition (Romme
et al., 1998). New environments might emerge from
broad-scale crown burning instead of the highly
mixed pattern of burn severity that prevailed on the
North Rim before 1880 (Fulé et al., 2003b). This
seems especially likely in the high-elevation forest
types of the Southwest because they are commonly
restricted to small and isolated “sky island” habi-
tats, with limited opportunity for re-introduction of
propagules. In addition to the ecological effects, the
consequences of unusually large crown ﬁres on the
North Rim have management, economic, and social
implications that should be considered. Such impli-
cations are beyond the scope of this study, but a
more comprehensive analysis may ﬁnd merit in ac-
cepting certain costs or risks (increased funding for
ﬁre management, higher risk of escaped ﬁres, more
smoke) in exchange for a more aggressive approach
to reducing landscape fuels and interrupting fuel
continuity.
