Abstract
This research analyzes patch development and determines tree spatial patterns along the lower mixed-conifer
ecotone on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona U.S.A.. Patterns of patch development
were interpreted from spatial analyses, based on tree age and size, and past records of disturbance and climate.
Five plots in the ecotone between mixed conifer forests and monospeciﬁc stands of ponderosa pine Pinus pon-
derosa were studied for patterns of patch development. The methods used include: 1 size-structure analyses, to
compare species patch development; 2 dendrochronological dating of tree establishment; 3 tree ring master
chronology, to determine periods of suppressed growth, compared to a Palmer Drought Severity Index; and 4
spatial analyses by species composition, size and age, with univariate and bivariate analyses of spatial associa-
tion and spatial autocorrelation. We found an increased density of shade-tolerant and ﬁre-intolerant species
namely clusters of pole-sized white ﬁr, and fewer large ponderosa pine.
Introduction
Disturbances are important factors affecting regener-
ation dynamics and successional processes in forest
communities across landscapes, especially at ecotonal
limits. Since plants growing near their physiological
tolerances can be sensitive to small change, ecotones
may provide detection of alterations of disturbance
regimes Hansen et al. 1988; Sirois and Payette 1991;
Mast and Veblen 1999. Moreover, in ecotonal areas
the extent of climate induced vegetation change is
likely to be indirectly affected by varying degrees of
disturbance Overpeck et al. 1990; Peet 1981; Veblen
and Lorenz 1991; Noble 1993; Mast et al. 1998.
Movements of conifer forest ecotones have been
noted in North America, particularly in the Rocky
Mountains Vale 1978; Veblen and Lorenz 1991;
Mast et al. 1997, California Wright 1966; Parker
1986, the American Southwest Allen and Breshears;
1998 and the Great Basin regions Foster 1917; Cot-
tam and Stewart 1940; Johnsen 1962; Burkhardt and
Tisdale 1976. Other ecosystems worldwide that con-
tain native or introduced conifer species have also
been affected by changes in disturbance regimes, par-
ticularly by ﬁre suppression Richardson and Bond
1991. For example, pine invasions in the Southern
Hemisphere are well documented in Argentina, Aus-
tralia, Chile, Madagascar, Malawi, New Zealand,
South Africa, and Uruguay Richardson et al. 1994;
Rejmanek and Richardson 1996.
In the present study, patch development and tree
spatial patterns are analyzed along the lower mixed-
conifer ecotone on the North Rim of Grand Canyon
National
Park
in Arizona

been little research on mixed-conifer forests in this
area. Situated at higher elevations c. 2100 m to 2500
m than ponderosa pine forests, the lower mixed-co-
nifer ecotone consists of ponderosa pine Pinus pon-
derosa in the overstory, with white ﬁr Abies
concolor and aspen Populus tremuloides occurring
as subcanopy species. The abundance of aspen is one
indication of extensive historical ﬁres on the North
Rim Merkle 1954. A Park policy of ﬁre suppression
began in 1919, resulting in lowered ﬁre frequency
Wolf and Mast 1998. Because the National Park
Service mandate is to maintain forests in their natural
condition, the changes in structure, species composi-
tion and spatial patterns at the ponderosa pine/mixed-
conifer ecotone should be viewed as “unnatural” if it
results from ﬁre suppression management Bonnick-
sen and Stone 1985; Parsons et al. 1986; Covington
et al. 1994. The objectives of this study are to 1
analyze size structure by tree species to compare spe-
cies patch development; 2 date tree establishment
by species, using dendrochronology; 3 create a tree
ring master chronology, to determine periods of sup-
pressed growth and climatic inﬂuences on tree estab-
lishment; and 4 examine spatial patterns of tree age
and size by species at these sites to ascertain if they
are consistent with the expected changes in tree spa-
tial patterns as cohort patches age.
Quantitative analyses of tree age structures and
spatial patterns have often been helpful in interpret-
ing patterns of forest development Veblen et al.
1981; Nakashizuka and Numata 1982; Getis and
Franklin 1987; Read and Hill 1988; Mast and Veblen
1999. Although initial spatial patterns may be deter-
mined by regeneration mechanisms, subsequent spa-
tial distributions may result from the ability of
individual trees to survive competition and dominate
the patch Oliver and Larson 1990; Deutschman et al.
1993. As a forest ages, tree distributions within a
patch may shift from a clumped distribution to a ran-
dom or regular distribution due to self thinning
and/or succession to shade-tolerant species Cooper
1961; Laessle 1965; Whipple 1980; Good and
Whipple 1982; Peet and Christensen 1987. When age
versus size class is analyzed, some variance may oc-
cur due to the development of a size hierarchy in ag-
ing even-aged cohorts Mast and Veblen 1999. In
other words, from a patch of small even-aged trees,
only a smaller number of trees can attain dominance
and large size within the patch. In a classic study in
the White Mountains of Arizona, Cooper 1960,
1961 described a mosaic of even-aged ponderosa

pine groups. He believed that these even-aged patches
resulted from simultaneous mortality of nearly all
trees in the patch and subsequent higher ﬁre intensi-
ties that created favorable seedbed conditions. In a
study of regeneration patterns near Flagstaff, Arizona,
White 1985 found patches of mixed-sized groups of
ponderosa pine, possibly resulting from one or two
individual trees in the patch dying and thus creating
small areas of seedbed.
In the semi-arid American Southwest, we hypoth-
esize that altered disturbance regimes may decrease
ponderosa pine regeneration at the mixed-conifer for-
est ecotone due to increased competition with other
conifer species. Ponderosa pine regeneration requires
a combination of several factors, such as sunlight
seedlings are shade-intolerant, a good seed year, ad-
equate seedbed conditions, and absence of drought or
ﬁre. Historically, frequent surface ﬁres maintained
open conditions, favoring shade-intolerant ponderosa
pine while reducing invasion from shade-tolerant co-
nifer species Dieterich 1983; Veblen et al. 1991;
Harrington and Sackett 1992; Wolf and Mast 1998.
Subsequent cessation of periodic surface ﬁres resulted
in increased density and distribution of shade-tolerant
conifer species, and the subsequent fuel accumulation
could lead to stand-replacing ﬁres Kilgore and Sando
1975; Burkhardt and Tisdale 1976; Parsons and De-
Benedetti 1979; Vale 1982; Savage 1989. In addi-
tion, overgrazing by domestic livestock can decrease
ﬁre frequency and ﬁre spread, altering the natural
evolution of a forest Leopold 1943; Covington and
Moore 1992; Covington et al. 1994.
Our research hypotheses are twofold. First, from
the size analyses, tree aging, and chronology devel-
opment, we hypothesize that ponderosa pine estab-
lishment in this lower ecotonal habitat is episodic at
stand-scales of c. 0.1 ha, while shade-tolerant white
ﬁr establishment has occurred continuously since ﬁre
suppression and cessation of livestock grazing. In ad-
dition, we hypothesize that these current mixed-coni-
fer lower ecotone forests were actually ponderosa
pine forests white ﬁr absent or uncommon prior to
the 1870s. Second, from the spatial pattern analyses
and following the cohort aging theory Kenkel 1988;
Szwagrzyk 1992, we hypothesize that internal patch
structure should become less clumped as single co-
hort patches age due to self-thinning with only a few
trees attaining size dominance in a small patch. Spe-
ciﬁcally, within the altered species composition,
internal patch structure should be comprised of white
ﬁr poles and small trees with a scattered remnant
large ponderosa pine in the overstory. Based on this
hypothesis, the spatial analysis questions addressed
are: Are there differences between and within conifer
species in the spatial patterns of tree ages and tree
sizes that imply development of a size hierarchy in
an aging patch? In addition, what are the human im-
pacts on the spatial patterns of species composition
and densities at the lower ecotone of the mixed-coni-
fer forest? Speciﬁcally, how does the hypothesized
shift in species composition from ponderosa pine
overstory to white ﬁr understory affect within-patch
spatial patterns?
Study area
General study area
The areas sampled are in the lower mixed-conifer
ecotone of the North Rim of Grand Canyon National
Park, part of the Kaibab Plateau located at 36° 00' to
36° 21' N and 111°46' to 112°30' W in north-central
Arizona Figure 1. The Kaibab Plateau is the highest
plateau on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, ris-
ing to 1300 m above the plateaus bordering it on the
east and west Maurer 1990. The study sites are on
the lower elevations of the Walhalla Plateau, a sub-
unit of the larger Kaibab Plateau, which gradually
slopes from 2200 m in the most southern points to
2500 m in the northern region. The uppermost layer
of rock is Kaibab limestone 100 m thick, which ex-
plains the lack of surface water due to the highly po-
rous and soluble nature of this rock Maurer 1990.
Soldier Series soil, underling the conifer forests in the
North Rim, is well drained with high percolation
Bennett 1973. Mean annual precipitation in the
study area is 642 mm White and Vankat 1992. May
and June are drought months, while July and August
have monsoon precipitation. Temperature averages
 6.05°C in January and 16.5°C in July, with sub-
stantial winter snowfall Bennett 1973, White and
Vankat 1992.
Although lightning provides ignition sources for
July and August ﬁres, ﬁres historically were also
started by Native American Indians. For thousands of
years prior to European settlement, Paiute and Navajo
Indians lived on the North Rim in the summers and
contributed to frequent ﬁre occurrence Hughes 1978,
White and Vankat 1992. Some researchers hypoth-
esize that Native American Indians created ﬁres to
keep forests open for hunting and agriculture Stew-

art 1956; Laven et al. 1992; Covington et al. 1994;
Parsons and van Wagtendonk 1996; for a review of
the debate, see Allen, C. D. 2002. Spanish explorers
generally did not establish settlements in the North
Rim, and Euro-Americans did not settle in northern
Arizona until the late 1800s Altschul and Fairley
1989; Moore et al. 1999. Between 1870 and 1880,
the Euro-American population grew to 40,000 on the
Kaibab Plateau and the surrounding region Hughes
1978. These homesteaders, primarily Mormon set-
tlers and ranchers, impacted the North Rim forests
through logging and livestock grazing. In addition to
removing harvested wood, loggers also burned the
resulting debris during timber removal, and this ac-
tivity may have increased ﬁre frequency Cooper
1961; Swetnam and Baisan 1994.
The North Rim became part of Kaibab National
Forest in 1883, and then was included in Grand Can-
yon National Preserve in 1906. As early as 1890, the
estimated head of cattle on the North Rim was 
100,000 with an additional 250,000 head of sheep
grazing the land Hughes 1978. When the North Rim
became part of Grand Canyon National Monument in
1908, sheep and cattle grazing were still permitted.
Cessation of livestock grazing began in 1919 when
the North Rim became part of Grand Canyon
National Park, established to preserve the scenery and
natural or historic landscapes Hughes 1978. In ad-
dition, heavy grazing at the turn of the century had
decreased the capacity of the grasslands to support
cattle and sheep. The formal policy of ﬁre suppres-
sion also began in 1919 when the North Rim became
part of Grand Canyon National Park Hughes 1978,
although de facto ﬁre exclusion began with the intro-
duction of livestock decades earlier. Silvicultural ac-
tivities also stopped in 1919 because it was seen as
destructive and contrary to the image of pristine wil-
derness Parsons and van Wagtendonk 1996.
Study sites
Five plots were randomly located in the lower
mixed-conifer forest ecotone in the North Rim Table
1. Overstory species present were ponderosa pine,
white ﬁr and aspen. Understory species included
Sweet William Verbena ciliata, yarrow Achillea
millefolium, lupine Lupinus argenteus, serviceberry
(Amelanchier utahensis, strawberry Fragaria ova-
lis, locust Robinia neomexicana, geranium Gera-
nium

repens, buckwheat Eriogonum spp. and brome
grass Bromus ciliatus. All of the stands contained
ponderosa pine established prior to 1860 i.e., the
stands are  140 years old.
Fire histories, determined from crossdated ﬁre-
scars Wolf and Mast 1998, show these ﬁve plots
experienced ﬁres in the period 1732-1938. Based on
a total of 30 ﬁre-scar trees sampled within a 300 m
search radius of each plot, our study areas show pre
Euro-American settlement prior to 1870 ﬁre inter-
vals were less frequent mean 8.5 years, standard de-
viation 9.38 years than the Euro-American settle-
ment era 1870-1919 mean 4.88 years, standard
deviation 3.87 years, but more frequent than the
suppression era 1920-1995 mean 18.75 years, stan-
dard deviation 8.08 years. Subsequent increases in
white ﬁr densities and distributions are hypothesized
to be a direct result of the dramatic decline in ﬁre fre-
quencies on the North Rim.

gion Fire Monitoring Handbook 1992, to serve as
assessment on pre-prescribed ﬁre conditions, and later
to monitor both immediate postﬁre effects and long-
term change. The plots were located randomly on the
lower elevations of the Walhalla Plateau by using an
overlay grid system of topographic maps. Plots were
rejected if they were located within 0.5 km of a road
or did not ﬁt the criteria of the dominant vegetation
characteristics ponderosa pine and at least one other
conifer tree species present in the overstory. Under-
story species were also surveyed along two 50 m line
transects in each plot using the point-line-intercept
method Veirs and Goforth 1988 to measure the fre-
quency of species occurrence, relative cover and den-
sity by species. Size data for all trees and poles was
determined from diameter measurements taken at
breast height dbh for trees deﬁned as  15 cm dbh
and poles deﬁned at  2.5 cm but  15 cm dbh.
Tree cores were taken near the base c. 10 cm of ev-
ery live and dead tree and pole in each plot for age
analyses and master chronology development. For the
spatial analysis, locations of trees and poles were
measured and mapped to the nearest 0.5 m using 50
m tapes in order to record X and Y coordinates in a
grid system.
Lab analyses
Size structure was analyzed in 5-cm size classes by
species and status live versus dead. Tree age data
consisted of ring counts from increment cores that
were mounted and ﬁne-sanded with successively ﬁner
grades of sand paper to reveal annual rings follow-
ing technique in Stokes and Smiley 1968. Rings
were counted using a binocular microscope to deter-
mine marker years which are annual rings with very
narrow ring widths or signatures Visser 1995.
Samples were cored near the ground to reasonably
determine establishment period no estimate of stem
age at coring height was added. Given the establish-
ment dates could be 1 to 3 years earlier than the tree
ring record, age structure was then analyzed in
10-year age classes. Ring counts were corrected for
false and missing rings by use of marker years. Al-
though there are shortcomings of using static age dis-
tributions to interpret population dynamics which
include both recruitment and mortality, given the dry
climate, longevity of the three tree species, and lack
of local disturbance by ﬁre, logging, or ﬁrewood col-
lection within our sampled stands, we believe that the
record of tree mortality during the last century is ad-
equately preserved in dead snags and logs.
In addition to visually cross-dating the cores for the
age structure analysis, the tree-ring program MEA-
SURE Krusic 1992 was used to determine ring
widths to the nearest 0.01 mm for a subset of ponde-
rosa pine to create a master chronology using a bin-
ocular microscope with an incremental measuring
machine. The tree-ring program COFECHA Holmes
1983; Grissino-Mayer and Holmes 1993 helped to
detect dating problems, such as false or missing rings,
by shifting series in time Dieterich and Swetnam
1984; Fritts and Swetnam 1989. Once dating prob-
lems were eliminated, a master chronology was cre-
ated using the tree-ring computer program ARSTAN
Cook and Holmes 1984 and skeleton plot strips.
ARSTAN creates master chronologies by standardiz-
ing and reducing variances by assigning a dimension-
less index to each ring width. To better detect
disturbances, a horizontal line detrending option was
chosen to avoid masking the growth trend of each
tree, i.e., the narrowing of rings due to the tree’s ge-
ometry Fritts and Swetnam 1989; Visser 1995. In
order to obtain the longest possible record, seventy-
six percent of the samples for the ponderosa pine
master chronology came from dead trees, with the
ages of trees sampled ranging from 126 years to 340
years 1757-1995. In addition, we obtained Palmer
Drought Severity Index PDSI data to determine any
relationships between climate and our master chro-
nology. PDSI data was obtained from the Paleoclima-
tology Program of the NOAA Climate and Global
Change
Program

Spatial statistics
Tree and pole spatial patterns from mapped locations
by size and age classes were analyzed by computing
Ripley’s Kt, Ripley’s K12t and Moran’s I Moran
1950; Ripley 1977; Legendre 1993; Haase 1995.
Duncan’s 1990 spatial statistics program was used
for these computations. All analyses were based on a
distance step size of 0.5 m and calculated up to 10 m
one half the distance of the shortest plot since edge
effects become a concern at greater distances. The
edge effects were accounted for by using Ripley’s
1977 toroidal correction. Statistical signiﬁcance was
determined by computing 95% conﬁdence intervals
using 99 simulations Besag and Diggle 1977; Mar-
riott 1979. After testing the sites for directional ori-
171

entation of trees anisotropy, all were found to meet
the assumption of isotropy no directional orientation
in the point pattern necessary for K-analysis.
Ripley’s Kt is a univariate analysis of single-spe-
cies or single group spatial distributions based on
point locations in a rectangular plot:
Kt  1Enumber of events within
distance t of an arbitrary event
1
where t is the distance, lambda  is the mean
number of events per unit area, and E is the expecta-
tion Ripley 1977; Ripley 1981; Diggle 1983. The
observed Kt value is compared with that expected
from a randomly distributed set of point locations and
conﬁdence intervals are derived from Monte Carlo
simulations. Regular or uniform distributions are
indicated by low values and clumped distributions by
high values of Kt for the various distances t. For
the Kt analyses, spatial analyses were performed for
two size classes, trees and poles. Classes were then
further divided into species groups ponderosa pine
and white ﬁr.
Spatial associations of ponderosa pine versus white
ﬁr were determined using Ripley’s K12t Lotwick
and Silverman 1982, Diggle 1983, Upton and Fingle-
ton 1985:
K12t  2
1 Enumber of type 2 events within
distance t of an arbitrary type 1 event
2
where t is the distance, lambda  is the mean
number of type 2 events per unit area, and E is the
expectation. The null hypothesis is spatial indepen-
dence.
Values
of
K12t
that
exceed
the
95%
conﬁdence interval indicate signiﬁcant positive asso-
ciations attraction while values below the 95% con-
ﬁdence interval indicate signiﬁcant negative associa-
tions repulsion.
Moran’s I, a measure of spatial autocorrelation,
was computed for tree ages Z  years and tree sizes
Z  dbh for trees and poles for all trees species
combined and also by species. The calculated Zd
value of Moran’s index for each distance class was
based on:
Zd  Id  EId ⁄VarId
3
where d is the distance class, Id is the value of
Moran’s coefficient for distance class d, E is the ex-
pectation, and Var is the variance species Moran
1950; Cliff and Ord 1973; Cliff and Ord 1981; Upton
and Fingleton 1985; Odland 1988; Legendre and For-
tin 1989. Trees are spatially deﬁned as neighbors if
within stated distance class then given a weight  1,
versus a weight  0 if not within stated distance
class. The null hypothesis is no spatial autocorrela-
tion Id0 for the variable age or size. Signiﬁ-
cant positive or negative spatial autocorrelations
indicate the values of the variable age or size are
spatially dependent.
Results
Size analyses
A total of 113 ponderosa pine, 312 white ﬁr and 50
aspen were sampled for size and age analyses in the
ﬁve plots. With regards to the live trees and poles,
ponderosa pine at these lower ecotone sites exhibited
a full range of sizes, from the smallest size to 95 cm
dbh class, yet few ponderosa pine average of 16 per
ha occurred in the 0-10 cm size classes Figure 2.
The mean number of ponderosa pine trees and poles
for the ﬁve plots was 246 per ha, with 190 ponderosa
pine trees/ha versus 56 ponderosa pine poles per ha.
In comparison, there was an average of 968 white ﬁr
trees and poles per ha 216 white ﬁr trees/ha versus
752 white ﬁr poles per ha. Moreover, 91% of the
white ﬁr were in the 0-29 cm dbh size classes, while
only 3 white ﬁr trees were  50 cm dbh. Aspen were
similarly sized, with 60% in the  10 cm dbh cat-
egory. The mean number of aspen per ha was 104 36
trees per ha versus 68 poles per ha. There were on
average 6 dead ponderosa pine trees per ha ranging
up to 50-54 cm size class but no dead ponderosa pine
poles. The mean number of dead white ﬁr per ha was
54 34 dead trees per ha versus 20 dead poles per ha,
also ranging up to 50-54 cm size class. On average
there were 28 dead aspen per ha, with 12 dead aspen
trees per ha up to 20 cm size class and 16 dead as-
pen poles per ha.
Age analyses
Ponderosa pine establishment peak 42% occurred in
1880 to 1919. The oldest ponderosa pine established
in 1721, and almost no ponderosa pine establishment
172

has occurred since the 1930s Figure 3. Aspen trees
that established in 1880s-1890s coincide with highest
frequency of ﬁre during the Euro-American settle-
ment period, although most aspen trees in the plots
date from 1970s and 1980s oldest dated to 1828. In
contrast, white ﬁr establishment peak 65% occurred
from 1920-1949. Overall, there has been a composi-
tional shift to higher amounts of white ﬁr establish-
ment, with 81% of white ﬁr establishing since the
1920s.

Master chronology and Palmer Drought Severity
Index results
The lower ecotone chronology had a high average
mean sensitivity or variation in annual ring index
marker years. Over 78% of the variance from the
mean of annual ring width index values was due to
autoregression, meaning that a high level of conﬁ-
dence may be assumed from the standardized values.
The signal-to-noise ratio effect of large-scale exo-
genous disturbances in ring series was 16.833, indi-
cating a high enough ratio value for cross-dating.
Variance in the ﬁrst eigenvector which represents the
ﬁrst expected coordinates was 61.98, due to sensitive
annual ring widths. In analyzing the standardized an-
nual ring index, ponderosa pine ring widths were
more compact for the most recent 70 years, beginning
11 years after the start of active ﬁre suppression in
1919 Figure 4. In regards to speciﬁc marker years
during the key time period of interest mid-1800s to
mid-1900s, narrow rings occurred in 1864, 1879-
1882, 1896, 1899, 1904, 1934, and 1951. Marker
years narrow rings in the chronology also corre-
sponded with a low PDSI for 1899 to 1904 and 1934.
Univariate spatial patterns
Overall spatial pattern by species was analyzed using
the univariate spatial statistic Ripley’s Kt for both
the “tree” and the “pole” size classes Table 2. Pon-
derosa pine trees displayed a random distribution
from 0.5 to 3.5 m patch radius and a clumped distri-
bution from 4.0 to 10.0 m patch radius. Similarly,
tree-sized white ﬁr showed random spatial distribu-
tion from 0.5 to 7.0 m and a clumped pattern from
7.5 to 10.0 m patch radius. In contrast, pole-sized
white ﬁr displayed clumped distributions at most dis-
tances from 0.5 to 10.0 m patch radius. There were
too few pole sized ponderosa pine   30 poles per
plot to run the Kt test.
Bivariate spatial associations
Bivariate spatial association tested with Ripley’s
K12t compared: 1 ponderosa pine trees versus
white ﬁr trees; and 2 ponderosa pine trees versus
white ﬁr poles Table 2. In the ﬁrst analysis, a pat-
tern of positive spatial association i.e., attraction
between tree-sized ponderosa pine and tree-sized
white ﬁr occurred at 1.5 to 3.0 m and at 6.5 to 7.5 m.
For the second analysis, no spatial association i.e.,
independence existed between ponderosa pine trees
and white ﬁr poles for all distances analyzed.

Spatial autocorrelation for size
When analyzed by species, tree-sized ponderosa pine
showed no spatial autocorrelation at smaller distances
0.5 to 4.5 m using the Moran’s I test for size, which
corresponds to both the univariate results of no
clumping at smaller distances Table 2. Ponderosa
pine in the tree size class exhibited positive spatial
autocorrelation at 5.0 m distance, indicating patches
with similarly sized trees separated by 5.0 m. Ponde-
rosa pine trees showed negative spatial autocorrela-
tion at larger 8 to 9 m distance, reﬂecting the
tendency of patches of larger trees to overlap with
patches of smaller trees Duncan and Stewart 1991.
When ponderosa pine trees and poles were combined,
positive spatial autocorrelation occurred at smaller
distances 2 and 3.5 m, interpreted as clumps of
similar-sized poles, while negative spatial autocorre-
lation occurred at larger distances 8 and 9.5 m, rep-
resenting larger patches of mixed-sized trees and
poles.
No spatial autocorrelation occurred at smaller
patch distances 1 to 5 m for tree-sized white ﬁr,
which corresponds with the univariate result of no
clumping at smaller distances Table 2. Negative
spatial autocorrelation existed for tree-sized white ﬁr
at larger patch distances 6.5 to 9.5 m, indicating
patches of mixed-sized white ﬁr trees. When analyzed
as tree and pole size classes combined, positive spa-
tial autocorrelation occurred for white ﬁr at smaller
patches distances 1 and 2.5 m, likely detecting small
patches of poles. At larger distances, no signiﬁcant
spatial autocorrelation for size existed for the white
ﬁr when the tree and pole size classes are combined.
When both ponderosa pine and white ﬁr trees were
combined, negative spatial autocorrelation exists
from 1.0 to 4.0 m and 6.5 to 9.5 m, representing
patches of smaller white ﬁr trees overlapping with
patches of larger ponderosa pine trees. In contrast
when ponderosa pine and white ﬁr were combined for
trees plus poles, spatial autocorrelation analyses for
size indicate the overall trend of positive spatial au-
tocorrelation at smaller distances 0.5 to 5.0 m, sig-
nifying small patches of similarly sized individuals
white ﬁr poles Table 2. Finally, negative spatial
autocorrelation for size existed at larger distances 6.0
to 9.5 m patch radius, representing larger patches of
mixed sized ponderosa pine and white ﬁr.

Spatial autocorrelation for age
When analyzed by species, signiﬁcant positive spatial
autocorrelation occurred for older ponderosa pine at
smaller distances 2.5 m and 3.5 m, indicating even-
aged patches, with no signiﬁcant spatial autocorrela-
tion at greater distances Table 2. Older white ﬁr
similarly trees showed positive spatial autocorrelation
1.5 m, 2.5 m, and 7.5 m. By analyzing older and
younger white ﬁr together, positive spatial autocorre-
lation occurred at smaller patch distances 1.0 to 4.5
m, representing small even-aged patches. Negative
spatial autocorrelation existed at larger patch dis-
tances 5 to 10 m, indicating mixed-aged patches of
older white ﬁr mixing with younger white ﬁr.
When older ponderosa pine and older white ﬁr
were combined, negative spatial autocorrelation oc-
curred at 1 m and 8 m, indicating younger white ﬁr
trees overlapping with older ponderosa pine trees.
When ponderosa pine and white ﬁr trees and poles
were analyzed together, positive spatial autocorrela-
tion for age occurred at smaller distances 0.5 to 5.0
m, signifying small patches of similarly aged trees.
In contrast, negative spatial autocorrelation for age
occurred at a larger distance 8 m, representing larger
patch of mixed-age ponderosa pine and white ﬁr.
Discussion and conclusions
Patch development along the lower mixed-conifer
ecotone on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National
Park has shifted from ponderosa pine forest white ﬁr
absent or uncommon to mixed-conifer forest in the
twentieth century. Ponderosa pine trees occurred up
to the 95 cm dbh size class but few individuals occur
in the pole size class. In comparison, the smaller pole
size classes comprised the majority of white ﬁr. Peri-
ods of peak establishment also contrasted between the
two conifer species, with little ponderosa pine estab-
lishment in the last 40 years. Ponderosa pine estab-
lishment peak 42% occurred in the 1880 to 1919,
while 81% of white ﬁr established since the 1920s.
According to the master chronology, ponderosa pine
ring widths became generally narrower for the most
recent 70 years, representing increased competition
and stress from white ﬁr. Thus, we would argue that
invasion of white ﬁr was at the expense of ponderosa
pine establishment. Fire histories, determined from
crossdated ﬁre-scars Wolf and Mast 1998, show
these ﬁve plots experienced ﬁres in the period 1732-
1938.
Following
years
of
drought
in
the
late
1896-1904 PDSI, the age structure indicates estab-
lishment of both ponderosa pine and white ﬁr
between 1910s during high PDSI values and 1940s,
but at the ratio of one ponderosa pine to nine white
ﬁrs. Although climatic variability has the over-riding
inﬂuence on the patterns of tree establishment, the
cessation of periodic ﬁres resulted in increases in the
density and distribution of shade-tolerant ﬁre-intoler-
ant white ﬁr, and the subsequent decrease in growth
and establishment of shade-intolerant ﬁre-adapted
ponderosa pine.
Univariate spatial statistics indicated random dis-
tribution of ponderosa pine in the tree size class at
smaller distances, likely due to shade intolerance and
competitive thinning of initially even-sized small
patches, but clumped at larger distances. This spatial
analysis of ponderosa pine is consistent with the in-
terpretation of stand development as consisting of
episodic tree establishment in groups Peet 1981.
When combined with the age structure results show-
ing white ﬁr was rare or absent in these stands prior
to the late 1800s, our interpretation is that ponderosa
pine trees initially established in monospeciﬁc stands,
with individual ponderosa pine trees spaced far
enough apart to avoid shading and competition for
water and nutrients with other ponderosa pine. Tree-
sized white ﬁr was randomly distributed at smaller
distances, likely due to competition causing density
dependent mortality. In contrast, pole-sized white ﬁr
was clumped at all patch sizes, as expected with an
invading shade-tolerant understory that had not expe-
rienced signiﬁcant competitive or ﬁre-caused thin-
ning.
As indicated by the bivariate spatial statistics,
white ﬁr establishment initially occurred under the
shade of mature ponderosa pine positive spatial as-
sociation between ponderosa pine and white ﬁr in the
tree size class, with subsequent white ﬁr establish-
ment occurring throughout the understory in the
shadier conditions following ﬁre suppression no spa-
tial association between ponderosa pine trees and
white ﬁre poles. Given that the age structure data
support the hypothesis that the study area was prima-
rily a ponderosa pine forest prior to the start of ﬁre
suppression, our interpretation is that the shade-toler-
ant white ﬁr seedlings that initially invaded the pon-
derosa pine forest would have better chance of
survival under the partial shade of larger ponderosa
pine due to increased moister and shelter. In con-
trast, as the forest grew denser, the shadier conditions
176

favored white ﬁr seedling establishment throughout
the understory, not just under the partial shade of
large ponderosa pine.
In the interpretation of spatial autocorrelation
analyses for size Moran’s I stastic, four types of
patches separated by large distances  
5 m
occurred: 1 mixed-sized ponderosa pine patches for
tree size class only, similar to White’s 1985 patches
of mixed-sized groups of ponderosa pine in ponde-
rosa pine forests near Flagstaff Arizona, 2 mixed-
sized ponderosa pine patches for tree and pole size
classes combined, 3 mixed-sized white ﬁr patches
for tree size class only, and 4 mixed-sized combined
species patches. In the ﬁrst case, patches of mixed-
sized ponderosa pine trees may represent a size hier-
archy that developed when one or a few of the shade-
intolerant ponderosa pine attained size dominance in
a patch due to competition for sunlight. In the second
patch type, mixed-sized patches formed from ponde-
rosa pine trees mixing with smaller pole-sized ponde-
rosa pine. The third type indicates patches of mixed-
sized white ﬁr trees, probably representing a size
hierarchy that developed when one or a few white
ﬁr attained size dominance in a patch. Finally, for
both species combined, the mixed-sizes of trees likely
represent overstory ponderosa pine trees mixed with
understory white ﬁr poles.
Spatial autocorrelation analyses for age show dif-
ferent results from the size analyses. Both older pon-
derosa pine and older white ﬁr were found in even-
aged patches positive spatial autocorrelation for age,
similar to Cooper’s 1960, 1961 description of a mo-
saic of even-aged ponderosa pine groups in ponderosa
pine forests in the White Mountains of Arizona. By
analyzing older and younger white ﬁr together,
smaller even-aged patches existed with mixed-aged
patches occurring at greater distances. When older
ponderosa pine and older white ﬁr were combined,
relatively younger white ﬁr trees were shown to
overlap in patches with relatively older ponderosa
pine trees negative spatial autocorrelation for age.
According to our hypothesis, internal patch struc-
ture should change as single cohort patches age due
to self-thinning and only a few trees may attain
dominance within a small patch Kenkel 1988;
Szwagrzyk 1992. Spatial autocorrelation results for
the size versus the age for tree-sized ponderosa pine
and tree-sized white ﬁr indicated patches of mixed-
sized negative spatial autocorrelation for size but
not mixed-aged trees at the 5 to 10 m distance. Hence,
as initially patches aged, a size hierarchy developed
with one or a few trees attain size dominance in a
patch. In contrast for white ﬁr trees and poles com-
bined, both size and age analysis showed even-aged
patches at smaller distances. This pattern resulted
from ﬁre suppression permitting seedling establish-
ment for patches of shade-tolerant white ﬁr seedlings
and subsequent lack of competitive thinning. As a re-
sult, even-aged “dog-hair” thickets of white ﬁr
occurred in the understory, with no individuals from
the post-1920 age cohorts reaching size dominance to
canopy height.
An alternative hypothesis to our conclusions could
be that white ﬁr was abundant in the early 1800s as it
is today, but simply had a faster turnover rate than
ponderosa pine i.e., shorter-lived species. Yet no
dead white ﬁr exist that date from before Euro-
American settlement in the 1870s in the plots, even
though the climate of this region is conducive to pre-
serving snags and logs Mast et al. 1999. In addition,
although white ﬁr has a shorter longevity compared
to ponderosa pine, this species can still produce cones
at well over 300 years old Burns and Honkala, 1990.
Hence, if white ﬁr were co-dominant in these forests
before the 1970s, then some establishment record
should still exist in the age structure. Moreover,
mixed conifer forests that naturally include white ﬁr
in the Southwest exist where ponderosa pine is minor
or absent and/or where the disturbance regime con-
sists of stand-replacing ﬁres Moir et al. 1997. The
fact that white ﬁr is ﬁre intolerant, especially in its
early years, limited their establishment due to high
ﬁre frequency until c. 1920.
Information on altered stand structures, modiﬁed
species compositions, spatial patterns, and shifted
successional patterns along mixed-conifer gradients
will help in developing forest management plans that
conserve natural patch mosaics and landscapes. With
ﬁre suppression and prohibition of cattle grazing af-
ter 1919, the lower mixed-conifer ecotone is altered
in both species composition and densities, reﬂecting
the impacts of human land use on this forest ecotone.
Future restoration plans for these forests need to in-
tegrate the natural spatial patterns and patch structure.
Our study now continues into the upper-most eleva-
tions of mixed-conifer forests that form ecotonal
communities with spruce and ﬁr forests on the North
Rim of Grand Canyon National Park.
In regards to adaptive management recommenda-
tion based on our ﬁndings, we advocate restoring the
ponderosa pine forest by removing the white ﬁr from
the understory. In addition, we recommend that land
177

managers conduct prescribed ﬁres to re-establish the
natural disturbance regime and forest structure. With
the shift in species dominance from ponderosa pine
to white ﬁr, the potential for stand-replacing crown
ﬁres on a large scale is greatly increased. One pre-
scribed burn will not restore the forest species com-
position and structure, needing instead decades of
restoration treatments with secondary and tertiary
prescribed burning and if feasible some mechanical
treatment to reduce white ﬁr. Given the forest condi-
tion and fuel load from the exclusion of ﬁre over the
last 80 years, as well as increased recreational use,
prescribed ﬁre would also need to be conducted un-
der carefully developed conditions to maximize con-
trol of the prescribed burns. Ideally, the use of
prescribed ﬁres with white ﬁr thinning will assist park
managers in returning the disturbance regime to one
of frequent low-intensity surface ﬁres.
