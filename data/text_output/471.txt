Abstract.
Southwestern ponderosa pine forests were dramatically altered by ﬁre regime
disruption that accompanied Euro-American settlement in the 1800s. Major changes include
increased tree density, diminished herbaceous cover, and a shift from a frequent low-
intensity ﬁre regime to a stand-replacing ﬁre regime. Ecological restoration via thinning
and prescribed burning is being widely applied to return forests to the pre-settlement
condition, but the effects of restoration on ecosystem function are unknown. We measured
carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) ﬂuxes during the ﬁrst two years after the
implementation of a replicated ﬁeld experiment comparing thinning and composite (thin-
ning, forest ﬂoor fuel reduction, and prescribed burning) restoration treatments to untreated
controls in a ponderosa pine forest in northern Arizona, USA. Total net primary productivity
(260 g C·m22·yr21) was similar among treatments because a 30–50% decrease in pine foliage
and ﬁne-root production in restored ecosystems was balanced by greater wood, coarse root,
and herbaceous production. Herbaceous plants accounted for ,20% of total plant C, N,
and P uptake in the controls but from 25% to 70% in restored plots. Total plant N uptake
was ;3 g N·m22·yr21 in all treatments, but net N mineralization was just one-half and two-
thirds of this value in the control and composite restoration, respectively. Element ﬂux
rates in controls generally declined more in a drought year than rates in restoration treat-
ments. In this ponderosa pine forest, ecological restoration that emulated pre-settlement
stand structure and ﬁre characteristics had a small effect on plant C, N, and P ﬂuxes at the
whole ecosystem level because lower pine foliage and ﬁne-root ﬂuxes in treated plots
(compared to controls) were approximately balanced by higher ﬂuxes in wood and her-
baceous plants.

INTRODUCTION
Humans affect all terrestrial ecosystems (Vitousek
et al. 1997), but some ecosystems are not resilient to
human-induced disturbances, and large changes in
structure and function follow perturbation (Holling
1973, Perry et al. 1989). In some cases, post-distur-
bance changes represent a shift from a ‘‘natural’’ stable
ecological state to an alternative stable state that may
persist indeﬁnitely (Scheffer et al. 2001). One goal of
restoration ecology is to return the structure and func-
tion of these ecosystems to the pre-disturbance stable
state, exempliﬁed by the ‘‘natural’’ range of ecological
variability (Jackson et al. 1995, Covington et al. 1997,
Moore et al. 1999). This paper focuses on ecological
restoration of ponderosa pine forests of the south-
western United States that were not resilient to the

disruption of natural ﬁre regimes by Euro-Americans
in the mid-1800s.
Prior to Euro-American settlement, frequent ﬁres
(every 2–20 yr), herbaceous competition, and drought
limited southwestern ponderosa pine regeneration but
rarely killed large trees (Pearson 1950, Cooper 1960,
White 1985, Swetnam and Baisan 1996). Some pre-
settlement ponderosa pine forests contained ;80% her-
baceous cover and 20% tree canopy cover (Covington
and Sackett 1992) with ;30–140 trees/ha (Covington
et al. 1994). Following Euro-American settlement, ﬁre
exclusion, livestock grazing, and a wet and warm cli-
mate reduced constraints on pine regeneration, allow-
ing herbaceous open spaces to ﬁll with dense thickets
of small pines (Savage et al. 1996, Mast et al. 1999).
Consequently, contemporary ponderosa pine forests in
Arizona average 727 trees/ha (O’Brian 2002), and some
stands have .2000 trees/ha and 10% herbaceous cover
(Covington et al. 1997). This new forest structure sup-
ports a stand-replacing ﬁre regime and expansive her-
bivorous insect outbreaks (Covington et al. 1994, Kolb

et al. 1998). Thus, southwestern ponderosa pine forests
have shifted from a stable mixture of herbaceous plants
and pines maintained by frequent surface ﬁres to an
alternative state with dense pine monocultures suscep-
tible to large stand-replacing ﬁres.
Ecological restoration is being used throughout the
Southwest to return ponderosa pine forests to pre-set-
tlement conditions by thinning post-settlement trees
and introducing prescribed ﬁres (Covington et al. 1997,
Lynch et al. 2000, Allen et al. 2002). These treatments
clearly restore the tree density, fuel, and ﬁre charac-
teristics of the pre-settlement forest (Covington et al.
1997, Fule´ et al. 2001), but they may also affect ﬂuxes
of water, carbon (C), and nutrients, characteristics we
refer to collectively as ecosystem function. Predicting
ecosystem functional responses to restoration is limited
by a lack of both restoration experiments and basic
biogeochemical research in dry western forests (John-
son et al. 1997, 1998).
Here we ask, ‘‘How do restoration treatments that
are designed to emulate pre-settlement aboveground
stand structure and ﬁre regimes impact C and nutrient
ﬂuxes in ponderosa pine forests?’’ To answer this ques-
tion, we measured initial biogeochemical responses to
restoration using a replicated ﬁeld experiment that
compared two restoration treatments to untreated con-
trols in an unharvested ponderosa pine forest in Ari-
zona. The thinning restoration treatment removed (via
whole tree harvesting) most of the aboveground post-
settlement tree biomass from the site. The composite
restoration included post-settlement tree removal, man-
ual forest ﬂoor fuel reduction, and a prescribed burn
(Covington et al. 1997). For the ﬁrst two years follow-
ing the application of these treatments, we measured
aboveground and belowground net primary productiv-
ity (NPP), plant nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) up-
take, and soil net N mineralization.
METHODS
Study site and treatments
The research was conducted in the Gus Pearson Nat-
ural Area within the U.S. Forest Service Fort Valley
Experimental Forest, 10 km northwest of Flagstaff, Ar-
izona, USA. Elevation is 2195–2255 m with a south-
west aspect and a slope of 0–5%. Mean annual pre-
cipitation was 577 mm from 1913 to 1993 (Savage et
al. 1996), half of which falls as snow and half as sum-
mer monsoonal rains (Schubert 1974). Our research
was conducted during one near-average year (1995) and
one drought year (1996) with low winter precipitation
(Fig. 1). Mean annual air temperature is 7.58C, with a
mean of 94 frost-free days. The soil is derived from
ﬂow and cinder basalt and is classiﬁed as a Brolliar
stony clay loam, a ﬁne, smectitic, Typic Argiboroll.
Surface mineral soil (0–15 cm) is approximately 23%
sand, 56% silt, and 21% clay with a pH of 6.9 in a
1:1 (mass : volume) solution of soil and 0.01 mol/L
CaCl2. The area was never logged, but livestock grazing
occurred between 1876 and 1910. In this paper, ‘‘pre-
settlement’’ refers to years prior to 1876, the year of
the last surface ﬁre at the site (Dieterich 1980), while
‘‘post-settlement’’ refers to years after 1876. Dominant
vegetation is ponderosa pine forest composed of large
(37–104 cm diameter at breast height [dbh, measured
at 1.37 m above the ground surface]) uneven-aged pre-
settlement pines surrounded by small (,37 cm dbh)
uneven-aged post-settlement pines or relict herbaceous
open spaces dominated by bunchgrasses (herbaceous
species are listed in Kaye and Hart [1998a]).
Fifteen 0.25-ha plots were established and assigned
to three treatments: control, thinning restoration, and
composite restoration. A fuel break was needed to pro-
tect buildings of the historic Fort Valley Experiment
Station, so the 10 restoration treatment plots were as-
signed randomly (ﬁve as thinning and ﬁve as compos-
ite) to plots closest to the buildings. The remaining ﬁve
plots were assigned to the control treatment. All areas
had statistically similar aboveground wood NPP (stem,
bark, and branches) and tree biomass (Table 1), mineral
soil organic matter and N concentrations (Stone et al.
1999), and mineral soil anaerobically mineralizable N
(S. C. Hart, unpublished data) prior to treatment. On-
site dendrochronological reconstructions (Mast et al.
1999) determined the stand structure in 1876. For the
thinning restoration, most trees that established after
1876 were removed from the site via whole tree har-
vesting in the fall of 1993 (Table 1). However, some
post-1876 trees were left intact to account for regen-
eration that would have naturally occurred between
1876 and 1993 and to replace pre-1876 trees that had
died (Covington et al. 1997). Composite restoration

included post-1876 tree removal in the fall of 1993,
followed by forest ﬂoor manipulation and a prescribed
burn in the fall of 1994. Forest ﬂoor manipulation prior
to the prescribed burn included raking aside the Oi
layer and removing the Oa and Oe layers from the site.
The Oi layer (2–4 yr of litterfall) was then returned to
the soil surface, with ;670 kg/ha of native grasses and
forbs mowed from nearby Hart Prairie. These forest
ﬂoor manipulations were intended to emulate the fuel
load of forests prior to ﬁre exclusion and were based
on previous local experience suggesting that old-
growth tree mortality is high when prescribed burns
are not preceded by the reduction of forest ﬂoor fuels
that accumulated over 120 yr of ﬁre exclusion (Cov-
ington et al. 1997).
Within each plot, we stratiﬁed sampling beneath
three or four canopy types because previous local re-
search showed that soil processes and their responses
to ﬁre vary among canopy types (Covington and Sack-
ett 1992). Canopy-type sample areas (circular subplots
of 5 m radius) were selected randomly from the pop-
ulation of potential subplots within each plot. All treat-
ments contained subplots beneath pre-settlement pines,
post-settlement pines, and in herbaceous openings (n
5 3 treatments 3 3 canopy types per plot 3 5 plots 5
45 subplots). The thinning and composite restoration
treatments also contained subplots beneath areas with
post-settlement pines removed (n 5 2 treatments 3 1
canopy type per plot 3 5 plots 5 10 subplots). Canopy-
type (subplot) data were scaled to the plot level using
a geographic information system (GIS) that contained
the area within each plot occupied by a given canopy
type (Table 1). To generate the GIS, a stem map of all
trees was used to generate a map of post- and pre-
settlement tree canopy cover from published relation-
ships between stem and crown diameter (McTague
1988). Based on the crown area map and extensive ﬁeld
checking, we manually digitized areas covered by relict
herbaceous openings, post-settlement pine tree crowns,
and pre-settlement pine tree crowns.
Once scaled to the plot level (n 5 5 for all treat-
ments), we used repeated measures ANOVA (a 5 0.10
for all tests) to assess the overall two-year treatment
effect and year by treatment interactions and one-way
ANOVA to assess treatment differences within a given
year (SYSTAT 7.0; SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA). We
log10 transformed data prior to statistical analyses when
variance was unequal among treatments, but values
presented here are means and standard errors of raw
(i.e., untransformed) data.
Plant C, N, and P cycling
Aboveground tree measurements.—In 1992, all trees
in the study area were mapped to the nearest 0.1 m and
dbh was measured. Radial growth since 1992 was mea-
sured on increment cores from sample trees in October
1996. All pre-settlement trees were sampled with three
short cores taken 1208 apart at breast height. In res-

toration treatment plots, a random 50% sample of the
retained post-settlement trees was taken with two cores
908 apart. In the control, with 6900 post-settlement
trees, 90 trees were sampled in each of two groups:
dbh ,10 cm and dbh $10 cm. The groups were selected
based on age–diameter relationships from the 1992
census and subsampled increment cores showing that
growth could differ between these size classes. Mor-
tality of the sample since 1992 was monitored, and
sample trees that died were replaced with randomly
chosen live trees to maintain equal sample sizes.
Increment cores collected in the fall of 1996 were
mounted,
surfaced,
crossdated, and annual radial
growth from 1992 to 1996 was recorded to the nearest
0.001 mm on an incremental measuring stage. Annual
radial growth increments were averaged per tree, dou-
bled, and added to the measured 1992 dbh to calculate
dbh in 1994, 1995, and 1996. We assumed that bark
thickness did not change signiﬁcantly from 1992 to
1996. Predictive relationships were developed to es-
timate annual growth and dbh of unsampled trees. Lin-
ear regression between 1992 dbh and measured annual
radial increments in 1995 and 1996 proved to have
reasonable explanatory power (r2 ; 0.5–0.8 for natural
logarithm
and
square-root-transformed
equations).
Separate predictive equations were developed for post-
settlement trees from each treatment.
The dbh values were combined with allometric equa-
tions to calculate tree biomass in 1994, 1995, and 1996.
The equations used combined data from 26 felled trees
from two separate studies (both conducted within the
Fort Valley Experimental Forest; Gholz et al. 1979; W.
W. Covington, unpublished data) to ﬁt linear regres-
sions between ln(dbh, in centimeters) and ln(biomass,
in kilograms) of speciﬁc tree components. The ﬁnal
equations were of the following form: dry biomass 5
a 3 e[b1ln(dbh)3c], where a corrects for logarithmic bias
(Sprugel 1983), b is the intercept of the linear regres-
sion, and c is the slope of the linear regression. The
resulting equations were

(P , 0.0001, r 2 5 0.90).
The minimum diameter of trees used to develop the
allometric equations was 16 cm (maximum 5 81 cm),
but our study site had many smaller trees. We compared
predicted biomass to measured biomass of trees from
7.6 to 15.2 cm dbh in the Fort Valley area (J. O. Klem-
medson, unpublished data). The predicted and actual
values were similar (;5%) for trees $10 cm. In dbh
classes ,10 cm, predicted biomass underestimated
measured biomass by as much as 50% for stem wood.
Although there were numerous trees smaller than 10
cm dbh in the study area, they comprised only ;7%
of the total biomass in 1992 (prior to thinning). There-
fore, even relatively large errors in estimating small-
tree biomass would have a limited effect on stand bio-
mass estimates and a smaller effect on production val-
ues, which are determined by difference.
Aboveground NPP of pine stem wood, bark, and
branches in 1995 was calculated as 1995 biomass minus
1994 biomass (similarly, 1996 productivity 5 1996
biomass 2 1995 biomass). Trees that died during a
measurement period were assigned zero NPP for the
entire period. Foliar NPP was calculated as the sum of
the live foliar mass increment (from changes in dbh
and Eq. 5) plus nonwoody tree litterfall. Tree litterfall
was collected every other month when the site was free
of snow using three collection buckets 1208 apart at 3
m from each subplot center. Litter was separated into
(1) needles, (2) wood, and (3) bark, cones, and mis-
cellaneous; dried to constant mass (24 h at 708C); and
weighed. Wood litterfall was excluded from NPP es-
timates because including it would imply that trees (1)
produced all of the falling wood during the measure-
ment season or (2) that new wood was produced to
replace the falling wood. In reality, most or all of the
wood litterfall was produced in the past. New wood
production was accounted for in the allometric Eqs. 1,
3, and 4.
Fluxes of aboveground tree biomass were converted
to C, N, and P ﬂuxes using the element concentrations
in biomass. The C concentration of all live biomass
was assumed to be 48% (kilograms of C per kilogram
oven dry mass 3 100%). The N and P concentrations
(also as a dry-mass-based percentage) in pine biomass
were measured in 17 trees within the Fort Valley Ex-
perimental Forest (W. W. Covington, unpublished data;
mean 6 SE): live branches, 0.25 6 0.01% N, 0.030 6
0.001% P; dead branches, 0.24 6 0.01% N, 0.012 6
0.001% P; stem wood, 0.045 6 0.001% N, 0.0017 6
0.0002% P; stem bark, 0.124 6 0.004% N, 0.009 6
0.001% P; and foliage, 1.12 6 0.02% N, 0.127 6
0.003% P. The element concentrations in tree litterfall
were determined by combining samples from the three
litter traps at each subplot for all collections during the
growing season (March or April to September or Oc-
tober) or winter months. These samples were ﬁnely
ground (,425 mm) and subsampled for digestion (mod-
iﬁed micro-Kjeldahl; Parkinson and Allen 1975) and
combustion (5508C for 6 h). Digested samples were

analyzed for N and P by ﬂow-injection colorimetry
using the salicylate (Lachat Instruments 1992a) and
molybdate-ascorbic acid (Lachat Instruments 1992b)
methods, respectively. Litterfall C concentration was
calculated as the ash-free dry mass (from combustion)
divided by 1.724 kg organic matter per kilogram or-
ganic C (Nelson and Sommers 1982).
Aboveground herbaceous measurements.—Above-
ground herbaceous and shrub production were mea-
sured on 1-m2 quadrats at each subplot (two quadrats
per subplot located 1808 apart at 50 cm from the subplot
centers) in mid-September when the majority of her-
baceous species have peak standing biomass. Quadrat
orientation changed annually to avoid clipping the
same place twice. Herbaceous aboveground vegetation
was clipped; separated into grasses, upland sedges,
non-legume forbs, and legumes; dried to constant mass;
and weighed. Herbaceous productivity was converted
to C, N, and P ﬂuxes using the nutrient concentrations
of the collected samples. The C concentration was as-
sumed to be 48% of dry biomass, while N and P con-
centrations were determined via micro-Kjeldahl diges-
tion as described for litterfall.
The only shrub encountered was buckbrush (Cea-
nothus fendleri Gray). Net productivity was measured
in 2.5 m radius circles centered on every subplot using
current year twig lengths. Buckbrush plants (n 5 54)
sampled off the subplots established the allometric re-
lationship between current year twig length and mass.
Using these data, shrub productivity was ,0.13 g
C·m22·yr21, so we excluded shrubs from further anal-
yses.
Root measurements.—Coarse tree root NPP was cal-
culated from annual changes in coarse root biomass
estimated from annual changes in dbh and an allometric
equation relating Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii)
dbh to the biomass of roots .10 mm in diameter (San-
tantonio et al. 1977). A synthesis of 25 studies sug-
gested that the relationship between root biomass and
dbh is robust across species and sites (Santantonio et
al. 1977). This equation underestimates coarse root
NPP by excluding roots from 2 to 10 mm in diameter.
Element concentrations in live branches $7.62 cm in
diameter (0.12% N, 0.009% P; W. W. Covington, un-
published data) converted coarse root biomass pro-
duction to element uptake, and we assumed that coarse
root dry biomass was 48% C.
Fine-root NPP was calculated from the biomass of
pine and herbaceous roots ,2 mm in diameter collected
monthly from April to October each year (Kaye and
Hart 1998b). One mineral soil core (0–15 cm depth,
5.1 cm inner diameter; AMS Core Sampler, American
Falls, Idaho, USA) was taken from a random location
within each of the 55 subplots (4 m from the plot
center), and roots were separated from soil in the lab-
oratory using a hydropneumatic elutriator (Science-
ware Bel-Art Products, Pequannock, New Jersey,
USA). Elutriated roots were collected on stacked sieves
(2 mm and 500 mm); separated by hand into live pine,
dead pine, and herbaceous categories; dried (708C) to
a constant mass; and weighed. Changes in root mass
over time were used to calculate root NPP in several
ways (see Appendix), and we concluded that the best
estimate of both herbaceous and pine ﬁne-root NPP
was the difference between maximum and minimum
ash-free, oven-dry mass of live roots during the grow-
ing season. To determine C, N, and P concentrations,
roots from the same treatment and canopy type were
composited and subsamples were digested or com-
busted as described for litterfall. Fine-root element
ﬂuxes were estimated separately for pine and herba-
ceous roots as the maximum root mass times root el-
ement concentration minus minimum root mass times
root element concentration. Element concentrations
were from the composited live root samples on dates
when root mass was maximum or minimum. Nutrient
use efﬁciency was calculated as total NPP (in grams
of C per square meter per year) divided by total plant
nutrient uptake.
Soil C and N measurements
We measured ﬁeld net N mineralization using mod-
iﬁed resin-core incubations (DiStefano and Gholz
1986, Binkley and Hart 1989) described in detail for
our site in Kaye and Hart (1998a). Brieﬂy, the entire
O horizon (depth varied from 0 to 18 cm) and under-
lying mineral soil (0–15 cm) were sampled from each
of the 55 subplots. Net N mineralization was calculated
from the difference between extractable (NH4
1 1
NO3

were converted to an aerial basis using the mean bulk
density of initial and ﬁnal mineral soil cores or O ho-
rizon mass per unit area measured with a 929-cm2 sam-
pling template (rather than our 17.7-cm2 surface area
core) at each subplot. Subsamples from all initial soil
cores collected in May of each year (1995, 1996, 1997)
were used to determine total soil C and N (Carlo Erba

the mean of all three years.
RESULTS
Carbon ﬂuxes
We did not detect (Fig. 2) treatment effects on total
aboveground (140 g C·m22·yr21), total belowground
(120 g C·m22·yr21), or total ecosystem NPP (260 g
C·m22·yr21), but we did observe large treatment effects
on C ﬂuxes in several ecosystem components (Table
2). The largest single component of aboveground NPP
(expressed as C ﬂuxes throughout) was pine foliage,
which was 30–40% lower in restored plots (79–99 g

C·m22·yr21) than control plots (128 g C·m22·yr21). Wood
production was greater in restoration treatments than
the control (Table 2), and in 1996 the 152 trees/ha
(Table 1) remaining after thinning produced three times
more wood than the 4132 trees/ha in control plots.
Aboveground herbaceous production was more than
two times greater in restored plots (8.0 to 17.5 g
C·m22·yr21) than controls (,4.0 g C·m22·yr21).
The largest belowground NPP ﬂuxes were herba-
ceous and pine ﬁne-root production (Table 2). Herba-
ceous ﬁne-root NPP was similar among treatments and
ranged from 20 to 70 g C·m22·yr21. Pine ﬁne-root NPP
was generally higher in the control (;100 g C·m22·yr21)
than the restoration treatments (43–70 g C·m22·yr21).
Less than 20% of ﬁne-root NPP was herbaceous in
control plots, while 25–70% of ﬁne-root NPP was her-
baceous in restoration treatment plots. Pine coarse-root
NPP was higher in restoration treatments than the con-
trol in both years (Table 2), but coarse roots constitute
only about 10% of belowground NPP. Roots accounted
for ;46% of total NPP in all treatments (Fig. 2).
Nitrogen cycling
Total plant N uptake was 3 g N·m22·yr21 in all treat-
ments and 50–60% of that N remained in ﬁne roots
(Fig. 3). Pine N uptake was lower in restoration treat-
ments (1.4–2.1 g N·m22·yr21) than the control (;2.5 g
N·m22·yr21), mainly because of differences in foliar N
uptake in 1996 (Table 3). Pine ﬁne-root N uptake (0.6–
1.4 g N·m22·yr21) was lower in restoration treatments
than controls by repeated measures ANOVA, but not
for individual years (Table 3). Other pine tissues took
up very little N (coarse roots and wood ,0.01 g
N·m22·yr21).
Herbaceous N uptake showed little treatment vari-
ation in 1995, but by 1996 herbaceous N uptake in
restoration treatments (1.0–1.4 g N·m22·yr21) was 3–4
times higher than the control (Table 3). Increased N
uptake was driven by changes in herbaceous biomass,
as foliar and root tissue N concentrations were similar
among treatments (data not shown). Overall, herba-
ceous plants accounted for ,12% of total plant N up-
take in the control and from 25 to 50% in restoration
treatments. Pines were about twice as efﬁcient as her-
baceous plants in using N to synthesize C, but whole
ecosystem N use efﬁciency (;92 kg C/kg N) did not
vary greatly among treatments (Table 3).
Net N mineralization (Fig. 3) was greatest in the
partial restoration treatment (;3 g N·m22·yr21) in both
years. In the composite restoration, net N mineraliza-
tion was ;2 g N·m22·yr21 in both years and control
values were 1.0 and 1.6 g N·m22·yr21 in 1995 and 1996,
respectively. Treatment effects on net N mineralization
(and interannual variability in the control) were driven
by changes in net nitriﬁcation as net ammoniﬁcation
did not vary greatly among treatments (Fig. 3).

are means (n 5 5 plots) 6 SE. For plant N uptake, there were
no signiﬁcant differences (P , 0.10) among treatments for
individual years or by repeated-measures ANOVA. For net
N mineralization, repeated-measures ANOVA on both years
resulted in no signiﬁcant differences in net NH4

(net ammoniﬁcation), but net N mineralization and net NO3
2
production (net nitriﬁcation) had signiﬁcant treatment (P ,
0.01) and year-by-treatment (P , 0.05) effects. For individual
years, lowercase letters (abc for 1995; xyz for 1996) above
bars denote treatment differences in net N mineralization, and
lowercase letters in the key denote treatment differences in
either NH4
1 or NO3
2 ﬂuxes. Net N mineralization data from
1995 are from Kaye and Hart (1998a). For plant P uptake,
the only signiﬁcant difference among treatments was higher
belowground P uptake in 1995 in controls than in either res-
toration treatment.
Phosphorus cycling
Total plant P uptake (Fig. 3) was similar among treat-
ments (0.36–0.53 g P·m22·yr21). Belowground P uptake
was lower in restoration treatments (0.23 g P·m22·yr21)
than controls (0.36 g P·m22·yr21) in 1995, mainly due
to relatively high pine ﬁne-root P uptake in control
plots (Table 4). Root P uptake accounted for 53–67%
of total plant P uptake in all treatments (Fig. 3). Pine
foliar P uptake was 30% lower in restored plots than
in control plots (0.15 g P·m22·yr21). This decline was
approximately balanced by increases in herbaceous fo-
liar P uptake following restoration (Table 4). Herba-
ceous roots took up substantial amounts of P (0.09–
0.18 g P·m22·yr21) but rates did not vary among treat-
ments. Herbaceous plants accounted for ,20% of plant
P uptake in the control and from 25 to 50% in the
restoration treatments. Woody tissues took up more P
in restoration treatments than controls, but P uptake in
these tissues was small (0.001–0.008 g P·m22·yr21). For
tissues with large P ﬂuxes (foliage and ﬁne roots), thin-
ning and composite restoration treatments had statis-
tically similar P uptake (Table 4). Unlike N, P use
efﬁciency was not necessarily lower in herbaceous
plants (6.4–7.8 kg C/kg P) than pines (5.9–8.0 kg C/
kg P) and restored plots had higher P use efﬁciency
than the controls (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
Despite the removal of .2000 post-settlement trees/
ha, forest ﬂoor manipulations, and prescribed burning,
we did not detect restoration effects on plant C, N, and
P cycling at the whole ecosystem level (Figs. 2 and 3).
In contrast, we observed large differences in element
cycling between controls and restoration treatments for
certain ecosystem components (Tables 2, 3, and 4).
Restored plots generally had signiﬁcantly greater ele-
ment cycling in wood and herbaceous plants than con-
trols, but these differences were approximately bal-
anced by a shift toward less element cycling in pine
litterfall and ﬁne roots in the restored plots. Thus, rapid
adjustments in vegetative growth within two years of
restoration appear to enable stability in plant element
cycling at the whole ecosystem level.
Carbon ﬂuxes
Fire exclusion has allowed a substantial accumula-
tion of C in the forest ﬂoor (O horizon) and biomass
of western forests, making these ecosystems a nation-
ally important C sink over the last century (Houghton
et al. 2000, Pacala et al. 2001, Schimel et al. 2002).
Ecological restoration may alter inputs (total NPP) or
outputs (decomposition, fuel and tree removal, ﬁre) of
C, with implications for C storage in ﬁre-prone forests
and thus, the U.S. C budget. We did not detect short-
term restoration effects on total ecosystem NPP (Fig.
2). In addition, treatment effects on biological C ﬂuxes
(Fig. 2, Table 2) were small compared to C exports

that occurred when the restoration treatments were im-
plemented. Thinning removed ;1770 g C/m2 from each
restoration treatment. In the composite restoration, for-
est ﬂoor manipulations and prescribed ﬁre removed an-
other 1426 and 175 g C/m2, respectively, for a total of
3370 g C/m2 (Kaye and Hart 1998b). It would take a
decade or more for post-treatment differences (treat-
ment value minus control value) in NPP (statistically
zero, but certainly ,50 g C·m22·yr21; Fig. 2) or soil
respiration (,90 g C·m22·yr21; Kaye and Hart 1998b)
to cumulatively equal the one-time C ﬂuxes that oc-
curred from mechanical thinning and prescribed burn-
ing. The fate of thinned tree biomass and the intensity
of prescribed ﬁres remain the most important factors
controlling the initial impact of restoration on regional
C budgets. On longer time scales, C ﬂuxes in the res-
toration treatments may diverge from one another, or
from the control, for a number of reasons, including:
(1) future pine establishment in thinned stands, (2) fu-
ture prescribed-ﬁre C losses, and (3) changes in the
relative production of slow (e.g., wood) vs. fast (e.g.,
herbaceous foliage) turnover plant tissues. The long-
term C storage potential of untreated forests must be
viewed in light of the likelihood of a stand-replacing
ﬁre that would rapidly transfer C stored in aboveground
biomass and the forest ﬂoor to the atmosphere (;8000
g C/m2; Table 1).
Our estimates of pine aboveground NPP (Table 2)
are lower than three ponderosa-pine-dominated stands
in southeastern Arizona (240–300 g C·m22·yr21; Whi-
taker and Niering 1975) but they are comparable to 20
young and old ponderosa pine stands across Oregon

(76–236 g C·m22·yr21; Law et al. 2001). Whitaker and
Niering’s (1975) stands had higher wood and foliage
production than our stands, while Law et al. (2001)
generally found higher wood production and lower fo-
liage production than our stands. We hypothesize that
low wood production in our control plots (compared
to other studies) results from the abundance of slow-
growing, small-diameter trees (Covington et al. 1997,
Mast et al. 1999). Increased wood production following
thinning (Table 2) has been observed over decades at
other southwestern (Pearson 1950, Ronco et al. 1985)
and western (Cochran and Barrett 1998) ponderosa pine
forests and likely relates to increases in water and N
availability for the retained trees. Increased understory
productivity following forest thinning has also been
observed across the Southwest (M. M. Moore, personal
observations) and Northwest (McConnell and Smith
1970, Riegel et al. 1992) and has persisted for 10 yr
at our site (C. Casey and M. M. Moore, unpublished
data). Increased light availability was likely the main
factor stimulating increased herbaceous production
(Naumberg et al. 2001), in addition to higher N and
water availability.
Following thinning with fuel reduction and pre-
scribed burning treatments (our composite treatment)
did not alter aboveground C ﬂuxes compared to thin-
ning alone. Previous studies have shown that prescribed
burning can cause declines in wood growth (Busse et
al. 2000), especially when forest ﬂoor fuel loads are
not reduced prior to burning (Peterson et al. 1994). Our
results suggest that thinning and forest ﬂoor fuel re-
duction can prevent post-burn declines in tree growth.
Our estimates of ﬁne-root turnover (annual produc-
tivity/maximum root mass 5 0.65 yr21 for pine and
0.92 yr21 for herbaceous roots in both years) fall in the
range of other ecosystems with similar precipitation
(Gill and Jackson 2000). Hart et al. (in press a) used
sequential soil cores to estimate ponderosa pine ﬁne-
root NPP within 10 km of our site in untreated controls
and plots burned for 20 yr at 2-yr intervals. Their con-

trol (96 g C·m22·yr21) and burned plot (74 g C·m22·yr21)
values were comparable to our control and restored
plots (Table 2), respectively. Law et al. (2001), using
a C budget approach in young and old ponderosa pine
stands in Oregon, USA, estimated ﬁne-root production
values twice as large those reported here (Fig. 2). The
Oregon site has lower litterfall and greater soil respi-
ration than our site (Kaye and Hart 1998b), so soil C
mass balance predicts greater belowground C alloca-
tion in Oregon (Raich and Nadelhoffer 1989).
N and P cycling
Nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers increase pon-
derosa pine growth in the Southwest (Wagle and Beas-
ley 1968, Heidmann 1985), and we expected that plant
N uptake would be correlated with plant-available N
in soil. However, the control and composite restoration
treatments had net N mineralization rates one-half and
two-thirds as large as plant uptake, respectively (Fig.
3). The discrepancy between plant N uptake and resin
core net N mineralization rates could have been caused
by treatment effects on plant–microbe competition,
plant N uptake from soil deeper than our incubations,
plant uptake of organic N, or differences between our
resin core estimate and actual net N mineralization in
the ﬁeld.
In other forests, thinning and prescribed burning typ-
ically increase inorganic N availability for ,5 yr fol-
lowing disturbance (Attiwill and Adams 1993), so it is
possible that net N mineralization in control and res-
toration treatments will become similar over time
(Monleon et al. 1997, DeLuca and Zouhar 2000). Al-
ternatively, lower N use efﬁciency by herbaceous
plants (Table 3) could induce a feedback in which high-
N litter increases net N mineralization rates in the res-
toration treatments over the long term (Hobbie 1992).
Net N mineralization rates in relict herbaceous open-
ings at our site are higher than in soils beneath post-
settlement pines (Kaye and Hart 1998a), supporting
this positive feedback hypothesis.
Mechanical thinning and ﬁre produced N ﬂuxes com-
parable to the annual biological ﬂux rates described
above (Fig. 3). We calculated (using the mass of tree
C removed and whole-tree C:N mass ratios) that thin-
ning removed from 2.7 to 3.2 g N/m2 from both treat-
ments, and in the composite restoration, forest ﬂoor
manipulation and the prescribed ﬁre removed an ad-
ditional ;2.5 g N/m2 (based on pre- and post-treatment
differences in standing stock; Hart et al., in press b).
Fire-related N losses were more than an order of mag-
nitude larger than annual soil leaching losses from the
site (Kaye et al. 1999), supporting the hypothesis that
the N cycles of semi-arid forests are distinct from well-
studied humid forests due to the importance of frequent
ﬁre (Johnson et al. 1997, 1998).
Total plant P uptake was about an order of magnitude
lower than N uptake (Fig. 3), but differences in P cy-
cling among restoration treatments were similar to
those described above for N. We estimate (see N cal-
culations above) that thinning removed 0.26–0.32 g P/
m2 from both restoration treatments and forest ﬂoor
manipulations and that the prescribed burn removed an
additional 0.09 g P/m2 from the composite restoration
plots. Thus, the quantity of P lost from the site when
the treatments were applied is comparable to one year
of plant P uptake (Fig. 3).
Drought, restoration, and ecosystem function
During our experiment, 1995 had typical precipita-
tion while 1996 was among the driest years of the pre-
vious ﬁve decades (Fig. 1). Soil water content from
April to June was 30% lower in 1996 than 1995 (Kaye
and Hart 1998b, Feeney et al. 1998). We hypothesized
that element ﬂuxes in restored plots would be less af-
fected by drought than controls because reduced leaf
area following restoration (Table 1) decreases evapo-
rative water loss (Kaye et al. 1999), allowing longer
storage of winter precipitation in soils (Feeney et al.
1998, Kaye and Hart 1998b).
To test this hypothesis, we used the interaction term
(year by treatment) in repeated measures ANOVA to
determine whether the effect of drought (the year effect
in the ANOVA) depended on restoration treatment. Soil
net N mineralization and nitriﬁcation, wood NPP and
nutrient uptake, herbaceous aboveground NPP and nu-
trient uptake, coarse-root NPP and nutrient uptake, pine
ﬁne-root P uptake, and previously published soil res-
piration data (Kaye and Hart 1998b) all had signiﬁcant
year by treatment interactions (P , 0.05). In all cases,
this interaction occurred because process rates in the
control were more greatly altered by drought than rates
in restored ecosystems. In all but one case (net N min-
eralization), drought decreased element ﬂuxes in the
control.
Our analysis assumes that drought was the dominant
cause of interannual variability in ecosystem function.
However, interannual changes (or lack of changes) in
ecosystem function in the restored plots may reﬂect a
large biogeochemical response to recent restoration
treatments, rather than an ecosystem with increased
drought resistance. Long-term measurements of eco-
system function will provide a stronger test of the idea
that restored ecosystems display less variability in eco-
system function in response to drought (Knapp and
Smith 2001).
CONCLUSION
In general, we found that restored ecosystems had
similar plant C, N, and P cycling rates as untreated
controls. However, this stability in whole ecosystem
element cycles resulted from important trade-offs
among ecosystem components. We detected very few
differences between the thinning and composite res-
toration treatments, but we expect that reestablishment
of dense tree cover in the thinning treatment will cause
these treatments to diverge in the future (Covington et

October 2005

RESTORING PINE ECOSYSTEMS
al. 2001). Nutrients did not appear to be major drivers
of post-treatment C ﬂuxes, as stands with variable soil
net N mineralization had similar NPP and plant N up-
take. In contrast, statistical treatment by year interac-
tions suggest that element ﬂuxes in untreated forests
may respond more to drought than element ﬂuxes in
restored ecosystems. On decadal time scales, the bio-
logical C ﬂuxes that we measured will have a small
inﬂuence on ecosystem C storage compared to potential
abiotic ﬂuxes in prescribed ﬁres, wildﬁres, and thin-
ning.
The restoration treatments applied here may not be
appropriate for other forests. The key to successful res-
toration is not to apply a single prescription to appar-
ently similar forests, but rather to use ecological prin-
ciples (e.g., adaptive ecosystem management in light
of historical variability and reference conditions; Kauf-
mann et al. 1994, Moore et al. 1999, Swetnam et al.
1999) to guide site- or region-speciﬁc restoration. Un-
der these guidelines, ecological restoration enables a
much broader range of management approaches than
ﬁre suppression alone (Allen et al. 2002). Ultimately,
southwestern forests will be managed for numerous
resources simultaneously. The success of restoration
may depend on the ability of restored ecosystems to
sustain C sequestration, nutrient retention, water yield,
water quality, forage production, and wood production,
while at the same time reducing ﬁre danger and in-
creasing biodiversity, wildlife habitat, and recreational
opportunities. Managing for all of these resources si-
multaneously may be impossible. However, our re-
search suggests that management based on ecological
restoration of pre-settlement stand structure and ﬁre
characteristics does not negatively impact resources de-
rived from plant C, N, and P cycling in the short term.
