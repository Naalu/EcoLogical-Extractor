Abstract 
To address concerns regarding how to prioritize treatments across the forests, the Ecological 
Restoration Institute received funding from the USDA Forest Service to identify priority 
treatment areas across the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests. In addition, Forest Service 
personnel stated a need to identify areas within the Wallow Fire perimeter that remain vulnerable 
to uncharacteristic wildfire.  
Existing Forest Service spatial data layers (Mid-scale vegetation diameter class, species and 
canopy cover) were used to identify restoration opportunity areas. Additional data layers 
(topography, land management designation, Wildland Urban Interface) were added to the 
analysis to identify priority restoration areas on the landscape. 
There are more than 133,000 acres within the Wallow fire perimeter that consist of priority 
restoration vegetation which experienced ≤50% basal area mortality and were thus deemed as 
continuing to be vulnerable to uncharacteristic wildfire. Less than half of this falls within the 
WUI boundary. 
Introduction  
Pine dominated and dry mixed conifer Western forests are uncharacteristically dense and have 
high fuel loadings (Fulé et al. 2012). In Arizona, these conditions, combined with more than a 
decade of below average precipitation (Hereford 2007) and projected increasingly common 
droughts (Seager et al. 2007), have made these forests particularly susceptible to large, 
catastrophic wildfires. The 538,049-acre Wallow fire burned 418,277 acres on the Apache 
National Forest in the summer of 2011. Greater than 50% basal area (BA) mortality occurred on 
nearly 240,000 acres (USFS 2011).  
We began by identifying restoration opportunity areas based on vegetation type, canopy cover 
and tree diameter. Topography, watershed function, land management designations, and location 
relative to the Wildland Urban Interface were added to the analysis to identify more specific 
priority restoration areas. On the Wallow fire, all areas that fell within the restoration opportunity 
areas and had a basal area mortality of ≤50% were selected. Similar to the forest-wide analysis, 
areas within Wildland Urban Interface were identified. 
Methods 
Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests 
The data layers used in this analysis were developed from the Mid-Scale Existing Vegetation 
Life Form data developed by USFS Region 3. The Mid-Scale data were developed from Landsat 
5 and/or Landsat ETM+ satellite imagery and include the following layers: life form, dominance 
type, canopy cover, and tree size using methods outlined in Brohman and Bryant 2005.  
The initial restoration opportunity areas were defined as being a dry conifer forest type having a 
canopy cover greater than 30% and with tree diameters <20” diameter at breast height (dbh). The 
dry conifer forest types selected from the Mid-Scale data included Ponderosa pine mix, 
Ponderosa pine-evergreen oak mix and Douglas-fir. The canopy cover and tree diameter criteria 

3 
 
were based on the existing Mid-Scale classifications. Total area on the Apache-Sitgreaves 
National Forest that meets all three criteria is 543,358 acres (Figure 1). 
In order to refine the restoration needs with National Forest priorities and values-at-risk, the 
following designated areas were added to the analysis; 1) Wildland urban interface (WUI), 2) 
Watershed Condition Framework (WCF) data, 3) Mexican Spotted Owl (MSO) protected 
activity centers (PACs); and 4) Existing Plan land management designations. Finally, slopes 
>40%, that may not be suitable for treatment activities (USDA Forest Service, 1987), were 
identified in the restoration opportunity areas and were masked from the restoration opportunity 
landscape. All input data layers were clipped to only include Forest Service managed lands. 
The WUI dataset was downloaded from the USFS Region 3 Geospatial Data website 
(http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r3/landmanagement/gis/?cid=stelprdb5202474). This was 
intersected with the restoration opportunity vegetation layer and the Ranger District boundary 
layer to determine acreage, by ranger district, of the restoration opportunity vegetation. 
The WCF is a consistent method used to evaluate watershed condition at individual National 
Forest and national levels (USDA Forest Service 2011). Watersheds considered to be 
“functioning at risk” or having “impaired function” might be considered to have restoration 
priority. This dataset was acquired here: http://www.fs.fed.us/publications/watershed/. Similar to 
the WUI dataset, this layer was intersected with the restoration opportunity vegetation and ranger 
district data layers. 
Mexican Spotted Owl data were acquired from the Lab of Landscape Ecology and Conservation 
Biology at Northern Arizona University. This dataset was originally developed for the Wood 
Supply Project (Hampton et al. 2011) using Forest Service data. The MSO layer was clipped to 
the forest boundary and was intersected with the priority vegetation and ranger district boundary 
layers to determine the acreage of restoration opportunity vegetation with the PACs. 
The Existing Plan management areas dataset were downloaded from the USFS Region 3 
Geospatial Data website. This dataset depicts the management areas of the existing Apache-
Sitgreaves National Forests Plan, which was signed in 1987. Management designations that 
could potentially affect the implementation of restoration activities were selected and exported to 
create a new data layer. These designations include Demonstration Areas, Primitive Areas and 
Additions, Research Natural Areas, Special Management Areas, and Wilderness.  
Areas that should be considered higher restoration priority were areas of the landscape with the 
combination of the restoration opportunity vegetation, with slopes of <40%, outside Mexican 
Spotted Owl PACs and not located within any of the selected Existing Plan designated 
management areas. The priority vegetation layer was intersected with the slope <40% layer, the 
ranger district boundary layer and the WCF dataset. The WUI dataset was used to clip the above 
described higher restoration priority layer to determine where restoration was required within the 
WUI. Finally, the Apache-Sitgreaves transportation layer was downloaded 
(http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r3/landmanagement/gis/?cid=stelprdb5202663) and the roads 
layer was buffered at 500 meters to determine the proximity of priority vegetation restoration 
areas to existing roads.

Wallow Fire Project 2.2a 
Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after Wildfire (RAVG) data were acquired 
(http://www.fs.fed.us/postfirevegcondition/index.shtml). RAVG data are developed for all fires 
that are >1,000 acres that occur on Forest Service lands. The data are available within 30 days of 
fire containment and are useful for identifying areas of concern by showing basal area mortality 
loss (USFS 2011).  
To determine areas within the Wallow perimeter that remain vulnerable to uncharacteristic 
wildfire, we started by converting the RAVG layer from a raster to a vector format and clipping 
it with the most updated Wallow perimeter (downloaded from www.mtbs.gov), intersecting it 
with the restoration opportunity vegetation layer developed in Project 1.6 and then finally by 
selecting those areas that had ≤50% BA mortality. Finally, this final layer was intersected with 
the WUI boundary layer.  
 Results  
Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests 
The ponderosa pine mix type is dominant and, at 503,384 acres, occurs on 93% of the restoration 
opportunity landscape (Table 1). The greatest amount, comprising 63% of the landscape, falls 
into the 10–19.9-inch diameter class. On both the Black Mesa and Lakeside ranger districts, the 
ponderosa pine mix type makes up 100% of restoration opportunity areas. This vegetation type 
makes up 70% of the restoration opportunity vegetation on the Clifton Ranger District (RD), 
91% on the Alpine RD and 96% on the Springerville RD. Ponderosa pine-evergreen oak mix is 
dominant on 20,215 acres, 3% of the area, and is most dominant on the Clifton RD. The 
dominant diameter class, at 14,481 acres, is 5–9.9 inches. Douglas-fir is found on 19,633 acres or 
roughly 3% of the area with the 10–19.9-inch diameter class being dominant. This type occurs 
on 15,786 acres, or 6% of the total, on the Alpine RD (Table 1).  
Nearly 97,000 acres (17% of the high-risk landscape) occur on slopes >40% (Figure 2). The 
Ponderosa pine mix vegetation type, in the 5–9.9 and 10–19.9-inch diameter classes, makes up 
78% of the steep slope vegetation with the greatest occurrences on the Alpine and Clifton ranger 
districts (Table 2).  
There are a total of 522,846 acres of designated WUI within the Apache-Sitgreaves National 
Forests, with the largest area (90,370 acres) being on the Alpine RD. The vast majority of the 
forested portion of WUI (Figure 3) is comprised of the ponderosa pine mix vegetation type with 
an area of nearly 175,000 acres. The diameter distribution of this class has nearly 67,000 acres in 
the 5–9.9-inch class and 91,000 acres in the 10–19.9-inch class (Table 3). Eighteen percent 
(31,172) of the WUI occurs on slopes >40% with the vast majority, 20,423 acres, on the Alpine 
RD. As of April 2010, 35,166 acres have been treated (Sitko and Hurteau 2010). Only 6% of the 
restoration opportunity vegetation within the WUI falls on slopes > 40% (Table 4). 
The WCF dataset shows that there are a total of 1,284,438 acres of designated “functioning at 
risk” watersheds (Figure 4). This comprises 61% of the forest. Twenty-two percent, 276,656 
acres, of the “functioning at risk” landscape is comprised of the restoration opportunity 
vegetation types with the majority (100,515 acres) of this designation being on the Alpine RD 
(Figure 5). The ponderosa pine mix type is the most dominant at nearly 260,000 acres with 

5 
 
162,924 acres being in the 10–19.9-inch diameter class. Thirty-three percent, or 699,648 acres, 
of the watersheds on the forest have a “functioning properly” designation and only 1,691 acres 
have an “impaired function” designation (Note: The attribute table for the WCF data layer used 
for the analysis lists this area of “impaired function” on the Tonto NF but it does clearly fall 
within the boundary of the Black Mesa RD on the Sitgreaves NF). Thirty-eight percent (263,725 
acres) of the “functioning properly” landscape is made up of the restoration opportunity 
vegetation types with nearly 62,000 acres on the Black Mesa RD. Eighty-two percent of the 
“impaired function” landscape is made up of these vegetation types with ponderosa pine mix 
being the dominant type in both designations (Table 5). 
Eight percent, 45,324 acres, of the restoration opportunity vegetation types fall within Mexican 
Spotted Owl designated areas (Figure 6). Of this, 93% is made up of the ponderosa pine mix 
type. The majority, 68%, occurs in the 10–19.9-inch diameter class. Fifty-five percent occurs on 
the Alpine RD while only 2% is on the Lakeside RD (Table 6).  
There are 284,132 acres of Existing Plan management areas (Demonstration Areas, Primitive 
Areas and Additions, Research Natural Areas, Special Management Areas, and Wilderness) on 
the forests (Figure 7). Nearly 80,000 acres of the restoration opportunity vegetation types occur 
within these management areas (Figure 8) with the majority being in the ponderosa pine mix 
vegetation type on the Alpine RD. Sixty percent, 34,507 acres, on this district has a Primitive 
Area designation and 5,641 acres are designated as Wilderness (Table 7). There are no Existing 
Plan designated management areas on the Lakeside RD. 
The intersection of the restoration opportunity vegetation layer with the slopes <40% dataset and 
with the MSO and Existing Plan designated management areas excluded, produced a data layer, 
the priority restoration vegetation layer, representing a landscape of 380,992 acres (Figure 9). 
This layer represents 70% of the restoration opportunity vegetation on the forests. The WCF 
“functioning at risk” and “impaired function” classes from the WCF layer were intersected to the 
above dataset to further refine areas where restoration should be considered as a higher priority 
(Figure 10). Fifty-four percent (205,857 acres) are in the “functioning at risk” category, 46% is 
in the “functioning properly” category and <1% of the area has an “impaired function” 
designation. Thirty-eight percent (136,045 acres) occurs on the Alpine RD with 49% (66,952 
acres) of this having a WCF “functioning at risk” designation. The Clifton RD has the least 
amount that falls into the priority restoration category with 16,658 acres. Of this, 74% (12,305 
acres) has a “functioning at risk” designation (Table 8). Ninety-one percent (346,599 acres) of 
the restoration opportunity vegetation, on slopes <40% with the MSO and Existing Plan 
management areas excluded, falls within 500 meters of existing forest roads. Over 90% of the 
priority restoration vegetation occurs within 500 meters of existing roads on all ranger districts, 
with the exception of the Clifton RD where 39% is within 500 meters of existing roads. 
The WUI was clipped from the priority restoration vegetation layer described above to produce a 
landscape of 121,941 acres (Figure 11). Forty-one percent (50,034 acres) occurs on the Alpine 
RD with the majority falling in the WCF “functioning at risk” designation in the ponderosa pine 
mix vegetation type. Less than 7,000 acres are present on both the Black Mesa and Clifton ranger 
districts with the majority found in the ponderosa pine mix vegetation type in WCF “functioning 
at risk” watersheds. The ponderosa pine mix vegetation type in combination with WCF 
“functioning at risk” watersheds are where, for all ranger districts, the majority of the priority 
restoration vegetation is found (Table 9). Ninety percent or more of the priority restoration 

6 
 
vegetation occurs within 500 meters of existing roads on three of the five ranger districts (Black 
Mesa, Lakeside, Springerville) with 84% meeting this criteria on the Alpine RD and 72% on the 
Clifton RD. 
Wallow Fire 
The RAVG data (Figure 12) show that a total of 418,277 acres burned with the majority of the 
fire (70%) occurring on the Alpine RD where a total of 292,089 acres burned. The Springerville 
RD had 113,482 acres burned (27% of total burned area) while the total area burned on the 
Clifton RD was 12,706 acres (3%). Nearly half of the area burned (239,349 acres or 48%) had a 
BA mortality of >50% with 159,159 acres occurring on the Alpine RD (Table 10). 
The layer representing areas within the Wallow perimeter that are still vulnerable to 
uncharacteristic fire shows a total of 133,153 acres (Figure 13). This is 27% of the total area 
burned. Eighty percent of this is on the Alpine RD with 106,174 acres. Of that, 90% (96,043 
acres) are in the ponderosa pine vegetation type with 66,932 acres in the 10–19.9-inch diameter 
class. The Clifton RD has the least amount of vulnerable vegetation with slightly over 4,720 
acres. Ninety-three percent of this is in the ponderosa pine vegetation type with the majority 
being in the 10–19.9-inch diameter class. Across all ranger districts, roughly 1% is in the 
ponderosa pine-evergreen oak mix vegetation type and just 6% is in the Douglas-fir vegetation 
type (Table 11). Sixty-three percent (83,782 acres) of all the vulnerable vegetation is in the 10–
19.9-inch diameter class and 122,187 acres (92% of the total) in the ponderosa pine mix 
vegetation type. There are a total of 109,845 acres still vulnerable to uncharacteristic fire located 
within the priority restoration area and 41,932 acres located within the WUI. 
There are a total of 47,869 acres that are still vulnerable to uncharacteristic wildfire in the WUI, 
which is 36% of the total area burned (Figure 14). More than 46,000 acres (96%) of this is within 
the ponderosa pine mix vegetation type. Of this, 63% is in the 10–19.9-inch diameter class and 
35% is in the 5–9.9-inch diameter class. Seventy-eight percent (37,157 acres) is located on the 
Alpine RD with 35,541 acres in the ponderosa pine mix vegetation type. Only 1,929 acres are 
located on the Clifton RD with all but 73 acres in the ponderosa pine mix type. Ninety-seven 
percent of the vulnerable vegetation on the Springerville RD is in the ponderosa pine mix type 
(Table 12). 
Summary 
The intersection of the restoration opportunity vegetation layer with the slopes <40% dataset and 
with the MSO and Existing Plan designated management areas excluded layer identified 380,992 
acres as having a high restoration priority. This was further refined using WCF data to determine 
the restoration priority area. Roughly 55% of the high restoration priority landscape falls in the 
“functioning at risk” and “impaired function” categories. In the event that the WUI has a higher 
treatment priority, nearly 122,000 priority restoration vegetation acres were identified within the 
WUI boundary. 
Approximately 133,000 acres within the Wallow fire perimeter consists of priority restoration 
vegetation, which experienced <50% basal area mortality and were thus deemed as continuing to 
be vulnerable to uncharacteristic wildfire. Less than half of this falls within the WUI boundary 
(Figure 14, Table 12).
