E
stimates of SOC often are needed for applications in ecol-
ogy, soil science, and global climate change. Many meth-
ods are available for measuring SOC, each with advantages and 
disadvantages in terms of accuracy, expense, and convenience 
(Nelson and Sommers, 1996). For example, elemental C ana-
lyzers are accurate, but they may be expensive to purchase, 
operate, and maintain. In comparison, the Walkley–Black pro-
cedure is cheap and fast to perform, but exhibits variable SOC 
recovery and generates hazardous byproducts such as Cr.
Loss-on-ignition, which involves combusting samples at 
high temperatures and measuring weight loss, has been pro-
posed as an inexpensive, convenient, and accurate method 
for estimating SOC (Ball, 1964; Lowther et al., 1990; Konen 
et al., 2002). In this method, LOI is used as an independent 
variable in regression equations to estimate SOC, which has 
been measured on test samples using direct methods such as 
elemental C analyzers (David, 1988; Cambardella et al., 2001; 
Konen et al., 2002). Strong linear relationships between LOI 
and SOC have been reported, with r2 values often exceeding 
0.90 (Christensen and Malmros, 1982; Soon and Abboud 
1991; Cambardella et al., 2001). For example, Lowther et al. 
(1990) reported an r2 of 0.99 for an LOI–SOC regression in 
Australian radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) forest soils. 
More recently, Konen et al. (2002) reported r2 values of 0.94 
to 0.98 in north-central USA soils.
While these studies suggest that LOI has great potential for 
easily and accurately estimating SOC, several important consid-
erations accompany LOI. Loss-on-ignition does not necessarily 
represent soil organic matter (SOM), because LOI can decom-
pose inorganic constituents (e.g., minerals and clay structural 
water) while not all SOM ignites (Alexander and Byers, 1932; 
Ball, 1964; Schulte and Hopkins, 1996). Optimal heating tem-
peratures and durations to maximize SOM combustion, while 
minimizing inorganic combustion, are difﬁ cult to determine. 
However, these temperatures and durations can substantially 
affect LOI and SOC/LOI ratios (Keeling, 1962; Ben-Dor and 
Banin, 1989; Schulte et al., 1991). As with SOM, the ratio 
of SOC to LOI also varies among soil types and with depth 
within a soil (Broadbent, 1953; Howard, 1965; Christensen 
and Malmros, 1982). As a result, numerous researchers have 
suggested that LOI–SOC equations be developed separately 
for different soil depths and types (Spain et al., 1982; David, 
1988; Konen et al., 2002). Additionally, both SOM and SOC 
have been estimated using LOI, making comparisons trouble-
some in the literature (Konen et al., 2002). Several researchers 
have suggested that because of the difﬁ culty of accurately mea-
suring SOM, and more recently with increased interest in C 
cycling, LOI generally should be used to estimate SOC rather 
than SOM (e.g., Broadbent, 1953; Nelson and Sommers, 
1996; Schulte and Hopkins, 1996). If desired, SOC can be 
converted to SOM using SOC/SOM ratios determined on test

Many studies in ecology, soil science, and global climate change require accurate estimates 
of soil organic C (SOC). When calibrated with direct SOC determinations, loss-on-ignition 
(LOI) has been proposed as a rapid, inexpensive, and accurate method for estimating SOC. We 
collected 0- to 15- and 15- to 50-cm mineral soil samples from 102 plots within a 110 000-ha 
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson) landscape to develop regression equations 
between LOI and SOC measured with an elemental C analyzer. We tested nine LOI tempera-
ture–duration combinations ranging from 300 to 600°C and 2 to 6 h to discern optimal com-
binations for estimating SOC, used the optimal combination to develop regressions for 100 
samples each of 0- to 15- and 15- to 50-cm depths, and assessed whether stratifying samples 
into ecosystem types improved LOI–SOC equations. Pearson r2 values between LOI and SOC 
did not exceed 0.74 for any LOI temperature–duration combination. These values showed 
no consistent trend to change with increasing duration, but tended to be slightly higher at 
the lowest temperature (300°C). Multiple regressions, including LOI and clay concentration, 
explained only 78 (0–15 cm) and 64% (15–50 cm) of the variation in SOC. Relationships 
between LOI and SOC found in this study are among the weakest reported in the soil litera-
ture, and it remains unclear precisely why observed relationships were weak. Our results sug-
gest that LOI may be useful for roughly estimating SOC in this region, but other methods or 
modiﬁ cations to LOI are needed when more accurate SOC measurements are required.

samples or obtained from the literature (Schulte and Hopkins, 
1996; Cambardella et al., 2001).
Most LOI research in North America has been performed 
on eastern, central, or northwestern temperate prairie or forest 
soils (e.g., Ranney, 1969; Schulte et al., 1991; Konen et al., 
2002). Our objective was to develop regression equations that 
estimate SOC (measured directly with an elemental C analyzer) 
from LOI for forest soils on a semiarid northern Arizona pon-
derosa pine landscape. Current research in these forests focuses 
on developing and evaluating ecological restoration and man-
agement prescriptions to reduce risks of wildﬁ re and improve 
ecosystem health (Covington et al., 1997; Allen et al., 2002). 
If SOC can be accurately estimated from relatively inexpensive 
and convenient LOI, this could be useful for ecological stud-
ies and for monitoring management effects on SOC (Gundale 
et al., 2005). Our speciﬁ c objectives were to: (i) test effects 
of heating temperature and duration on LOI and LOI–SOC 
relationships to determine optimal heating procedures for esti-
mating SOC from LOI; (ii) develop regional regression equa-
tions to estimate SOC from LOI using these optimal heating 
temperatures and durations; and (iii) examine the variability of 
LOI–SOC relationships within and among ecosystem types of 
similar vegetation and soils previously classiﬁ ed in an ecosys-
tem classiﬁ cation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Area
We collected soil samples at elevations between 1920 and 
2660 m within a 110 000-ha landscape in the northern half of the 
Coconino National Forest and in the Northern Arizona University 
Centennial Forest. This landscape surrounds the City of Flagstaff in 
northern Arizona (study area SW corner 35°04′ N, 111°53′ W; NW 
corner 35°29′ N, 111°51′ W; NE corner 35°23′ N, 111°31′ W; SE 
corner 35°01′ N, 111°23′ W). Based on three weather stations, mean 
total precipitation across the study area ranges from 42 to 56 cm yr−1, 
snowfall from 152 to 233 cm yr−1, and mean maximum daily temper-
atures from 15.7 to 17.5°C (Western Regional Climate Center, Reno, 
NV). Prevalent soil parent materials include volcanic cinders, basalt, 
benmoreite, and limestone. Major soil subgroups are Typic and Udic 
Argiborolls, Typic and Mollic Eutroboralfs, Typic Ustorthents, and 
Vitrandic Ustochrepts (Miller et al., 1995). Forests are primarily pure 
ponderosa pine, but trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) or 
Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.) occasionally occur with pon-
derosa pine. Understories are grass dominated, with major species 
including squirreltail [Elymus elymoides (Raf.) Swezey], mountain 
muhly [Muhlenbergia montana (Nutt.) A.S. Hitchc.], Arizona fescue 
(Festuca arizonica Vasey), and blue grama [Bouteloua gracilis (Willd. ex 
Kunth) Lag. ex Grifﬁ ths].
Sample Collection
On 102, 0.05-ha (20- by 25-m) plots distributed across the land-
scape, we collected soil samples of 0- to 15- and 15- to 50-cm depths 
from two pits per plot. We composited samples for each depth on a 
plot basis (?2 kg of ﬁ eld-moist soil from each depth of each plot). 
Plots were located within 10 ecosystem types previously classiﬁ ed in 
a landscape ecosystem classiﬁ cation for the study area (Abella and 
Covington, 2006). Ecosystem classiﬁ cation groups sites into ecosys-
tem types, each internally similar in topographic, soil, and vegeta-
tive characteristics (Barnes et al., 1982). We stratiﬁ ed our sampling 
by ecosystem type in the present study because sharp differences in 
several soil properties occurred among ecosystem types (Table 1). This 
stratiﬁ cation is similar to a recent LOI study by Konen et al. (2002), 
who found that LOI–SOC regression equations differed among land 
resource areas in the north-central USA.
Laboratory Analysis
Samples were air dried and sieved through a 2-mm sieve. We 
analyzed samples for texture (hydrometer method) and pH (1:2 soil/
0.01 M CaCl2) following Sparks (1996) and Dane and Topp (2002). 
We also estimated CaCO3 equivalent using an approximate gravimet-
ric method (Goh et al., 1993). After grinding samples to pass a 53-μm 
sieve and pretreating samples with 10% HCl to remove potential car-
bonates, we analyzed 30-mg samples for organic C using an elemental 
C analyzer (FlashEA 1112, Thermo Electron Corp., Waltham, MA).

Based on analysis of duplicate samples every 10 samples, measure-
ment error averaged ≤5% for all analyses. Analysis of laboratory 
reference standards for the C analyzer also differed on average by 
<0.1% C from true values, and C was not recorded in blanks.
Separately for 0- to 15- and 15- to 50-cm depths, we randomly 
selected three plots in each of the 10 ecosystem types from which to 
extract samples to test temperature and duration effects on LOI and cor-
relations with SOC (n = 30 for each depth). We heated sieved (<2 mm), 
5-g samples (air-dry weight) from each plot at 105°C for 24 h in an 
electric oven and then weighed the samples to measure moisture loss 
before LOI. Loss-on-ignition treatments were applied factorially, with 
three levels each of temperature (300, 450, and 600°C) and duration 
(2, 4, and 6 h). These temperature and duration combinations span a 
range commonly used in LOI studies (Schulte and Hopkins, 1996). We 
placed samples in completely random order in individual porcelain cru-
cibles and performed LOI treatments in a Thermolyne model F-A1730 
mufﬂ e furnace (Sybron Corp., Dubuque, IA). The internal chamber 
dimensions of the furnace were 25 (width), 23 (height), and 35 (depth) 
cm. Based on analysis of three randomly selected duplicate samples for each 
temperature–duration combination, LOI repeated measurement errors 
averaged 3.5% for 0- to 15-cm and 3.9% for 15- to 50-cm samples. We 
also examined the effects on LOI of shorter time durations (15, 30, 60, 90, 
and 120 min) at 300°C using 0- to 15-cm samples from three randomly 
selected plots in each of 10 ecosystem types.
Based on LOI–SOC correlations found in the factorial experiment 
of LOI temperature–duration combinations, we selected 300°C and 2 h as 
the optimal combination for estimating SOC from LOI. Correlations on 
average were highest at 300°C, and since they changed little with increasing 
duration, we selected 2 h as more convenient than longer durations. We 
used this combination to develop regression equations for estimating SOC 
from LOI using samples from 100 plots for each of the 0- to 15- and 15- to 
50-cm depths. A maximum of 50 samples could be placed in our mufﬂ e 
furnace at one time, so we randomly selected 100 of our 102 plots for inclu-
sion in the analysis and heated samples in sets of 50 for each depth.
Statistical Analysis
We analyzed the factorial temperature–
duration experiment with LOI weight as the 
response variable using a two-factor analysis of 
variance with plots serving as blocks. Plots were 
designated as blocks because samples for treat-
ment were extracted from composite plot sam-
ples. Tukey’s test was used for mean separation. 
Raw data met equal variance (Levene test) and 
normality (Shapiro–Wilk W test) assumptions. 
Pearson r2 values between LOI and SOC also 
were computed for each temperature–duration 
combination. We developed LOI–SOC regres-
sion equations based on 300°C, 2-h LOI using 
simple linear regression. Including soil texture 
with LOI has occasionally been reported to 
enhance estimation of SOC (Spain et al., 1982; 
Donkin, 1991; Soon and Abboud, 1991). To 
examine whether texture or other measured 
variables improved estimation, we used for-
ward, stepwise multiple regression, inputting 
LOI, sand percentage, clay percentage, pH, and 
CaCO3 equivalent. Statistical analyses were per-
formed using SAS JMP (SAS Institute, 2002).
RESULTS
In the factorial temperature–duration experiment, mean 
LOI increased with increasing temperature but not exposure 
duration for both the 0- to 15- and the 15- to 50-cm samples 
(Table 2). Temperature was highly signiﬁ cant for both depths 
(F > 467, P < 0.0001), while duration was not (F < 2.3, P > 
0.10). Pearson r2 values between LOI and SOC never exceeded 
0.74, showed little consistent trend to change with increasing 
duration, and tended to be highest at 300°C.
After 15 min at 300°C, 79% of the 2-h LOI had already 
occurred for high-LOI aspen ecosystems, while 86% had 
occurred for low-LOI black cinder ecosystems (Fig. 1). After 
90 min, 98 to 99% of the 2-h LOI had already occurred, on 
average, for all samples.
Regression equations estimating SOC from LOI (300°C, 2 
h) using 100 samples for each depth attained r2 values of 0.69 (0–
15 cm) and 0.58 (15–50 cm; Fig. 2). The y intercepts were small, 
and forcing the regressions through the origins did not change the  
r2 values. Clay concentration was the only variable in addition to 
Table 2. Mean loss-on-ignition (%) and r2 values with organic C for 
different temperature and duration combinations for northern 
Arizona ponderosa pine forest soils.

LOI that improved SOC estimation in multiple regression. Clay 
slightly improved r2 by 0.09 to 0.78 (0–15 cm) and by 0.06 to 0.64 
(15–50 cm). Including additional variables (sand, pH, or CaCO3 
equivalent) produced improvements of <0.02.
Relationships between LOI and SOC varied among ecosystem 
types. For example, 0- to 15-cm r2 values ranged from zero (xeric 
basalt ecosystems) to 0.97 (mesic limestone ecosystems). There were 
no clear trends, however, for relationships to be stronger or weaker 
among ecosystems with certain soil properties or parent materials. 
Basalt parent materials, for instance, exhibited the lowest r2 (xeric 
basalt ecosystems) and among the highest r2 (0.93, rocky basalt eco-
systems). Half of the 10 ecosystem types for both depths exhibited 
r2 values ≤0.7.
DISCUSSION
Heating Duration and Temperature
We did not ﬁ nd that heating samples at a given tempera-
ture for longer than 2 h increased LOI or consistently increased 
the r2 between LOI and SOC (Table 2). In fact, in our test at 
300°C, we found that 85 to 89% of LOI occurred in the ﬁ rst 
30 min and 98 to 99% occurred in the ﬁ rst 90 min (Fig. 1). 
Howard (1965), for example, also found that LOI changed 
little after 2 h of heating British 
soils at 550°C. In contrast, Schulte 
et al. (1991) determined that LOI 
at 360°C differed signiﬁ cantly 
among 2-, 4-, and 16-h heating 
durations in two soils ranging in 
LOI from 4 to 46%. Ben-Dor and 
Banin (1989) reported intermedi-
ate results, with 80 to 90% of LOI 
at 400°C occurring within the ﬁ rst 
8 h in arid Israeli soils. These varia-
tions in times to constant weight 
may result from differences in LOI 
temperature, organic contents, or 
other factors.
Consistent with previous stud-
ies (e.g., Ranney, 1969; Shulte and 
Hopkins, 1996), temperature was 
a dominant factor affecting LOI, 
with a near doubling of LOI when 
the temperature was increased from 
300 to 600°C (Table 2). Morever, 
r2 values between LOI and SOC 
tended to decrease with increasing 
temperature. In one of the few previ-
ous studies examining temperature 
effects on LOI–SOC relationships, 
Donkin (1991) found that temper-
atures of 350 to 450°C produced 
the highest correlations among nine 
temperatures ranging from 150 to 
900°C. He found, however, that 
r2 values were similar (0.92–0.94) 
for temperatures between 250 and 
900°C. Temperature had a larger 
effect on LOI–SOC relationships 
in our study, with r2 values for 0- 
to 15-cm samples differing by 0.18 to 0.24 when increasing 
temperature from 300 to 600°C (Table 2).
Loss-On-Ignition–Soil Organic Carbon Relationships
Loss-on-ignition explained only 69% (0–15-cm samples) 
and 58% (15–50-cm samples) of the variation in SOC in our 
regression equations using 100 samples for each depth (Fig. 2). 
These relationships are weak compared with other published 
studies, which have reported r2 values >0.85 (Table 3). Clay 
concentration was the only variable in our study that improved 
predictions in multiple regressions, although improvements 
were only slight (6–9% increases in variability explained). 
While determining speciﬁ c reasons why LOI–SOC relation-
ships were weak is beyond the scope of this study, there are 
some possibilities. These weak relationships may be related to 
the LOI temperature–duration combinations we used, meth-
odological problems in measuring both SOC and LOI, the 
fairly narrow range of SOC in our samples, inherent character-
istics of the soils, or other factors.
A temperature and duration combination that we did 
not test could have resulted in stronger LOI–SOC relation-
ships. We did test nine temperature–duration combinations,

however, spanning ranges commonly used in LOI studies 
(Schulte and Hopkins, 1996). It is possible that temperatures 
<300°C might result in stronger relationships with our soils, 
because there was a slight trend for LOI–SOC relationships to 
weaken with increasing temperatures (Table 2).
Methodological problems, both with the SOC elemental 
analysis and the LOI procedures, might have decreased accu-
racy. However, we followed standard procedures for both anal-
yses (Nelson and Sommers, 1996; Shulte and Hopkins, 1996). 
Furthermore, repeated measurement errors for both SOC and 
LOI averaged <5%, and no problems were evident in analyses 
of blanks and laboratory reference samples using the elemental 
C analyzer. Nevertheless, it is difﬁ cult to entirely rule out the 
possibility of some unknown methodological problem. It also 
is possible that processing samples and performing analyses dif-
ferently, such as grinding LOI samples more ﬁ nely than just 
to pass a 2-mm sieve, might have changed results. Shulte and 
Hopkins (1991) found that LOI was insensitive to such factors 
as the number of samples placed in a mufﬂ e furnace at one 
time, but that the weight of samples used did affect LOI. It is 
unclear whether sample weight affects LOI–SOC correlations.
Our samples did contain a fairly narrow range of SOC, 
with maximum SOC concentrations on the low end of those 
reported in LOI studies (Table 3). Donkin (1991) found that 
LOI–SOC relationships were strongest in soils with low (<5%) 
SOC concentrations. Conversely, Soon and Abboud (1991) 
concluded that LOI was unreliable for estimating SOC in low 
(<1.5%) SOC soils. We detected no consistent trend for LOI–
SOC relationships to strengthen for ecosystems high or low in 
SOC. Additionally, slopes and y intercepts for our LOI–SOC 
regressions are not unusual compared with other studies (Fig. 
2, Table 3).
There might be inherent characteristics of soils in our study 
area that weakened LOI–SOC relationships. The presence of car-
bonates has sometimes been cited as impacting LOI–SOC rela-
tionships, but typically only when using LOI temperatures above 
approximately 500°C (e.g., Davies, 1974). Few of our samples con-
tained carbonates (Table 1), however, and we also tested two tem-
peratures below 500°C. Loss of minerals or structural water from 
clay also have been implicated as affecting LOI–SOC relationships 
(Ball, 1964; Spain et al., 1982), but inclusion of clay improved 
estimation of SOC by <10% in our multiple regressions. Fires his-
torically burned frequently across our study area (Covington et al., 
1997), and it is possible that charcoal or elemental C remaining in 
soils from these ﬁ res (DeLuca et al., 2006) affected LOI–SOC rela-
tionships. Our study area also is semiarid, and few LOI studies have 
been performed in semiarid or arid soils. Ben-Dor and Banin (1989), 
however, reported strong LOI–SOC relationships in arid Israeli soils 
with SOC estimated using the Walkley–Black procedure.
Other factors cannot currently be ruled out for explaining 
our weaker LOI–SOC relationships compared to other studies. 
It is possible that other studies have found weak LOI–SOC 
relationships, but analogous to underpublishing of statisti-
cally nonsigniﬁ cant results (Møller and Jennions, 2001), these 
results have not been published. As another example, r2 values 
might not be optimal for assessing the ability of LOI to esti-
mate SOC and for comparisons among studies (Neter et al., 
1996; Harris et al., 2001). Our LOI–SOC regression equa-
tions did exhibit wide scatter (Fig. 2), however, and a purpose 
of LOI–SOC research is to develop simple, readily useable 
LOI–SOC equations (Konen et al., 2002).
CONCLUSIONS
Our data suggest that LOI may be useful for estimating 
SOC in these soils when only rough estimates are required. 
Future research could try to clarify reasons why our LOI–SOC 
relationships were weak compared with other published stud-
ies. Modiﬁ cations to the standard LOI procedure used here, 
such as more ﬁ nely grinding samples, also could be tested for 
improving relationships with SOC. Our results suggest, how-
ever, that directly measuring SOC, such as with an elemental C 
analyzer, may be more accurate and straightforward than esti-
mating SOC from LOI in this region.
