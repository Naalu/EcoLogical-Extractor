Abstract 
Ponderosa pine (Pinus pondkrosu Laws.) overstory-forage 
understory relationships were studied on the Kaibab Plateau of 
northern Arizona to evaluate bow well forage (graminoid, forb, 
and current year shrub) production could be predicted by stand 
density index (SDI). Linear and nonlinear equations were used. 
Stand density index, a relative measure of stand density, was a 
useful predictor of understory production for a variety of stand 
structures and ages. The linear and nonlinear equations produced 
coefficient of determinations of 0.76 and 0.72, and standard error 
of the estimates of 5.08 kg ha” and 5.51 kg ha-l, respectively. 
measure of stand density that provides a relationship between trees 
per hectare, stand basal area, average stand diameter, and stocking 
of a forested stand. Reineke noted that the log of trees per hectare 
when plotted against the log of quadratic mean diameters (the stem 
diameter of average basal area) took on a negative linear form that 
had a slope of -1.605. This relationship is considered analogous to 
the biological -3/2 self-thinning 
power law (Yoda et al. 1963). In 
application, 
it is assumed that an increase in quadratic 
mean 
diameter of fully stocked stands can only occur if accompanied by 
a decrease in number of trees per hectare. The functional form of 
this relationship is:

Many equations used in predicting forage (graminoid, forb, and 
shrub) production 
as a function of ponderosa pine (Pinusponde- 
rosa Laws.) forest overstory have expressed overstory as basal 
area, an absolute measure of stand structure, and canopy cover 
(Pase 1958, Reynolds 
1962, Pearson 1964, Ffolliott and Worley

Uresk and Severson 1989, Tapia et al. 1990). These studies used 
inverse linear and nonlinear 
models expressed as decreasing her- 
bage production 
with increasing forest overstory and have found 
basal area and canopy closure to be highly correlated with forage 
and herbage production.

Stand density index is defined by imposing the condition that SD1 
equals the number 
of trees per hectare when quadratic 
mean 
diameter is equal to 25.4 centimeters. McTague and Patton (1989) 
give an excellent discussion of the derivation of stand density index 
and present Reineke’s SD1 in the following form: 
Additional knowledge of stand structure is necessary, however, 
to interpret what effect a given tree basal area will have on forage 
production. In the Southwest, for example, a ponderosa pine stand 
with a basal area of 10 m2 ha-’ would be open and park-like in 
stands composed of large mature trees. Forage production below 
such a stand would likely be greater than in a stand with the same 
basal area composed of many small-diameter stems. Predictions of 
forage production 
may be improved if the expression of tree den- 
sity incorporated 
additional stand structural information. 
There- 
fore, relative measures of stand density which relate absolute stand 
attributes 
to stand structure are attractive for use in predicting 
forage production.

Other self-thinning constants have also been suggested for ponde-

can be written in the same functional form as equation 2:

Study Area 
Stand density index (SDI) is commonly referenced in the litera- 
ture for use in prescribing tree stocking levels (Stout and Larson 
1988, Edminster 1987) and describing wildlife thermal and hiding 
cover (McTague and Patton 1989); however, to our knowledge it 
has never been used as a predictor of forage production. 
The 
objective of this paper is to demonstrate that stand density index is 
also a reliable predictor of forage production. 
Methods 
Stand Density Index 
Our study area consisted of ponderosa 
pine stands within 4 
townships (between latitude/longitude: 
36O 30’OO”N 112O 15’OO”W, 
36” 45’OO”N 112” 3O’OO”W) on the North Kaibab Ranger District 
on the Kaibab National Forest. This district is located north of 
Grand Canyon National Park in Coconino County, Arizona.

The primary overstory species of the study area are ponderosa 
pine with clumps of gambel oak (Quercusgambelii 
Nutt.) scattered 
throughout. 
Rocky Mountain 
juniper 
(Juniperus 
scopulorum 
Sarge.) is occasionally present. The graminoid understory is domi- 
nated by 2 species of bluegrass (Poafendleriana 
Steud. Vasey., and 
Poa longiligzdu Scribn. and Williams) and bottlebrush squirreltail 
(Sitanion 
hystrix Nutt.). The most common forbs include several 
species of lupine (Lupinus spp.). Buckbrush (Ceanothus fendleri

Gray.) and Oregon grape (Berberis repens Lindl.) are the major 
shrub species. 
The climate for the Kaibab Plateau is characterized as cool and 
subhumid. 
Mean annual precipitation 
ranges from 50 to 62 cen- 
timeters (cm) with a mean of 56 cm. Approximately 
55% of this 
moisture falls during the late fall and winter months (October to 
March). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 6O C. The 
average frost-free period is 100 days (Schubert 1974). Elevation of 
the plots varied from 2,250 to 2,500 meters. 
The soils are derived from limestone parent material of the 
Kaibab formation. 
The study plots were located on the most 
common soil subgroups of the Kaibab Plateau-Mollic 
and Typic 
Eutroboralfs (USDA Forest Service 1986). 
Sampling Design 
Understory and overstory characteristics were measured on 93 
study plots in pine stands that ranged in age from 70 to 250 years; 
average number of stems per hectare was 322, ranging from 0 to 
1200; and average quadratic mean diameter (cm) was 37, ranging 
from 0 to 92. 
All study plots were located on areas that were harvested at least 
10 years prior to sampling since a study by Reynolds (1962) on the 
Kaibab Plateau shows that this IO-year period should be a sufti- 
cient time since harvest to negate the “harvest effect” on the 
understory. 
Line transects were established within each stand and plot data 
were collected at 60.4-meter (3chain) intervals along the transects. 
The transect length and number of transects within a stand and the 
number of plots along each transect varied with stand size. Each 
overstory fixed plot was 400 square meters (20 X 20 m). Tree 
species and diameter at breast height (dbh) were recorded for each 
tree inside the plot. 
Initial sampling failed to produce a sufficient number of plots of 
low tree density. Therefore, 10 additional plots were taken in the 
low densities (e.g., O-30 mr basal area) to ensure adequate estima- 
tion of this critical portion of the response function. 
To determine understory standing crop three 0.5 X 2.0 meter (1 
mr) understory 
quadrats were sampled for each overstory plot. 
This shape was chosen to reduce variation 
caused by natural 
patchiness of the understory vegetation. These understory quad- 
rats were located 2 meters from plot center and were oriented 120” 
apart. 
All current-year’s 
standing crop of grass, sedge, and forb was 
clipped to ground level and separated into plant type for each 
understory plot. Grasses were also separated into cool and warm 
season components. 
Current-year 
twig growth below 1.37 meters 
was clipped on shrubs. Understory data were collected between 22 
August and 23 September 1988. Plant samples were oven dried at 
70” C and were reported on a kg/ ha basis. 
After summing yields in each quadrat and converting to kilo- 
grams per hectare, average yield from the 3 quadrats was used to 
develop relationships between forage yield and SD1 for that over- 
story plot. 
Statistical Procedures 
Simple linear and nonlinear regression procedures were used to 
develop forage production 
models using stand density index. 
Residuals were plotted for all regression equations to check for 
systematic lack of fit and violations of regression assumptions. 
These revealed that variance increased with the untransformed 
dependent 
variable (i.e., understory 
production) 
response with 
decreasing overstory density. Hence, a square-root transformation 
(Weisberg 1985) was applied to the dependent variable for all of the 
overstory-forage 
production models presented. All analyses were 
conducted at the 0.05 alpha level. 
Results 
Forage production averaged 441 kg ha“ and ranged from 7 to 
2,111 kg ha-‘. The mean SD1 was 459, with a range of 0 to 1,274 and 
a standard deviation of 296. 
The relationship between tree overstory density and forage pro- 
duction for SD1 was negatively sloped and curvilinear. This con- 
cave function was expected since the understory 
was graminoid 
and forb dominated (Clary 1987). A square-root transformation 
was used to stabilize understory production variance; however, the 
transformation 
also changed the form of this relationship by mak- 
ing the shape of the curve less concave compared to a graph of the 
untransformed 
data. In high stand densities, the relationship 
between tree overstory density and understory 
production 
was 
weak or asymptotic (i.e., approximately 
a horizontal line). This 
condition was prevalent with decreasing stand density to a thres- 
hold where forage production 
(transformed) 
increased approxi- 
mately linearly with continued decreasing overstory density. 
General Model Comparison 
The piece-wise linear model (Y = Intercept + Slope1 (D) + Slope2 
(D - Break)*X) and the nonlinear model (Y q  a + b*expeD) were 
both suitable for approximating 
the relationship 
between over- 
story density and forage production 
for SDI; where, Y q  square 
root of understory production (ovendry 
kg ha“), D = stand den- 
sity index (SDI), X = 1 if D > BREAK, 0 otherwise, exp = base of 
natural logarithms, and a,b,c are coefficients to be determined. 
Initially, semi-log and log-log transformations 
were used because 
models are reported most often in the literature for ponderosa pine 
forests (Ffolliott 1983). Surprisingly, 
these log models displayed 
heterogeneous variance and showed signs of systematic lack of fit 
in this analysis based on examination 
of the residuals. A square- 
root transformation 
on the dependent variable alleviated these 
problems. The coefficients of the least-square regression solutions 
for the piece-wise and the nonlinear models are presented in Table 
1.

A statistical technique does not exist to test for significant differ- 
ences in explained 
variation 
between 2 models with the same 
number of parameters. 
Therefore, the models in Table 1 were 
ranked using coefficients of determination 
(r-square) and standard 
error of the estimate (SE). The better model has a higher r-square 
and a lower SE. The piece-wise models consistently 
explained 
more variation in understory 
production 
than did the nonlinear 
models. The piece-wise regression lines for stand density index are 
shown in Figure 1. The regressions were run on Reineke’s SDI, as

Stand Density Index 
Understory production kg ha-l versus stand density index ush~g 
equations developed by Reineke (R), Larson (L), and Edminster 
well as the SD1 equations developed by Larson (1986) and Edmins- 
ter (1987). The difference in explained variation between Reineke’s 
SD1 and those suggested by Larson (1968) and Edminster (1987) 
for predicting forage production is trivial (Fig. 1). 
Understory Response 
Regression analysis applied to a simple linear model with no 
intercept (to assure zero percent production when total production 
equals zero) showed that on an average, grasses composed 49% of 
the total understory production by weight in all overstory densities 
while sedges, forbs, and shrubs attributed 
12, 37.5, and 1.5% of 
production, respectively. These production increments are depicted 
in Figure 2 for Reineke’s stand density index. 
Understory vegetation response. to the overstory appeared to be 
dependent on understory plant type. Overstory density effects on 
understory production 
were most predictable for the herbaceous 
plants (i.e., grasses, sedges, and forbs) while shrubs showed only a 
slight response to changing overstory density (Fig. 3). However, 
the shrub component 
was greatly undersampled 
in the l-m* 
quadrats. 
Cool-season plants showed a much stronger relationship with 
overstory density than did warm-season 
plants. As a rule, cool- 
season grasses, sedges, and forbs responded more predictably to 
changes in stand density than did warm-season vegetation regard- 
less of the plant type (Fig. 4).

would be possible; however, their plots were grazed by cattle which 
rendered comparisons with this study inappropriate. 
The r-square and standard error values using SD1 as a predictor 
of forage production in this study (Table 1) fall within the range of 
values presented in several recent articles using basal area (m* ha-‘) 
as the predictor variable (Uresk and Severson 1989, Tapia et al. 
1990). These studies were conducted in the ponderosa pine type 
also. Uresk and Severson (1989) used both simple linear and nonli- 
near models and obtained r-square values of 70,72, and 83%, and 
standard errors of 393,226, and 379, for 3 years of data, respec- 
tively. Tapia, et al. (1990) used semilogarithmic 
and polynomial 
models in their equations and obtained r-square values of 70 and 
76.5% and standard errors of 0.25 and 0.23, respectively. The 
point is that using SD1 as a predictor of forage production appears 
to be reliable, it does not appear to be that much more reliable than 
those using basal area. However, these and other studies are not 
directly comparable because there are many other factors which 
influence understory production such as soil quality, precipitation 
patterns, overstory canopy cover, differences in harvest and slash 
treatments, and past use which have not been held constant. There- 
fore, in order to directly compare the merits of each predictor 
variable, a study needs to be conducted which examines each 
predictor simultaneously. 
Linear versus Nonlinear Models 
The piece-wise linear model and the exponential 
nonlinear 
model performed well as general models for predicting understory 
production. The linear models explained slightly more variation in 
understory production than did the nonlinear ones. Both models 
differ in how they mimic the threshold response of forage produc- 
tion in low SD1 and the asymptote in high SDI. However, the 
piece-wise general model is most certainly not the “true” form of 
the tree. overstory-forage understory relationship for 2 reasons. 
First, the break point or “kink” 
of the piece-wise line is not 
continuous 
because the first derivatives of the 2 lines at the break 
point are not equal. Secondly, the piece-wise models are not truly 
asymptotic as would be expected of the “true” relationship (Neter 
and Wasserman 1974, Weisberg 1985). Neither of these shortcom- 
ings, however, are important for predictive purposes because the 
piece-wise line is nondisjoint, 
and the model remains asymptotic 
for unreasonably 
large SD1 values. Thus, in all other aspects, the 
piece-wise model seems biologically appropriate for representing 
the observed relationship. 
There are several advantages that can be realized by using the 
linear piece-wise model rather than the nonlinear 
ones. Statisti- 
cally, linear regression is simpler to calculate and more flexible, 
and the results are easier to interpret than nonlinear 
regression. 
The semi-log and log-log models can be estimated using linear 
least-square 
procedures. 
However, in instances evident in this 
study where none of the logarithmic models provide a good tit to 
the data, the piece-wise general model permits another linear 
option. A transformation 
of the dependent, independent, 
or both 
variables may be necessary to comply with regression variance 
assumptions. 
Management Implications 
Arizona’s pine forests produce quantity of resources simultane- 
ously (timber, forage, water, esthetics) and are a prime place to 
practice multiple use management. Therefore, an understanding 
of 
pine overstory-forage production relationships is important. Also, 
measurements 
collected from relative measures of stand density 
such as SD1 (e.g., tree diameter) are often used to drive certain 
resource models and could reduce the redundancy of data collec- 
tion in an integrated resource inventory. 
In our l-year study, SD1 was a useful predictor of understory 
production 
in a variety of stand structures and ages. Although, 
stand density index was developed for even-aged stands, it may be 
used for describing density in uneven-aged stands (Stage 1968), for 
describing wildlife habitat (McTague and Patton 1989), and for 
predicting forage production, especially when the forage is domi- 
nated by grasses.
