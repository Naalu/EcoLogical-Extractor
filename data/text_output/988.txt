Biomass power plant feedstock procurement: Modeling 
transportation cost zones and the potential for competition 
by Anil R. Kizha., Han-Sup Han, Timothy Montgomery and Aaron Hohl
Transportation of comminuted (processed) woody biomass from the production site to 
a utilization point is one of the most costly operational components in feedstock pro-
curement. This study identified potential sources of feedstock based on transportation 
cost from which three woody biomass power plants in Humboldt County, California, 
could economically obtain their supply. We conducted service area and location-
allocation network analyses for timberlands and sawmills, respectively, and created 
inclusive and exclusive networks to model three transportation cost zones (TCZs). The 
area within the $20/bone dry ton TCZ had the highest potential supply of woody bio-
mass in the county (709,565 acres). All sawmills in the county were within an economi-
cally viable distance of the power plants. Even though there was no competition for raw 
materials at the time of this study, a competition risk analysis suggested that this could 
change with shifts in the demand for biomass or the price of electricity. The methods we 
developed for this study could be adapted to other regions with managed timberlands 
and a strong forest products industry. 
H
umboldt County, California, has 
approximately 1.7 million acres 
of forestland and maintains a 
strong forest products industry. Electri-
cal power imports to the county are con-
strained by its remote location and lack 
of infrastructure. Consequently, it is a 
prime location for wood-based biomass 
energy plants. However, transportation 
costs have been a fundamental barrier to 
woody biomass utilization (Han and Mur-
phy 2012). Even at 50 miles or less, trans-
portation costs can be $10 to $30 per bone 
dry ton (BDT) (Galik et al. 2009). The fixed 
maximum weight limit on a chip truck of 
40 tons in California increases transporta-
tion cost compared to neighboring states, 
which allow an increase of weight limits 
with an increase in the number of axles 
and axle spacing in a truck. 
Therefore, the first objective of this 
study was to determine the transportation 
cost zones (TCZs) for procuring woody 
biomass (the byproducts, or residues, of 
forest management and sawmill opera-
tions) from various timberlands and saw-
mills to fuel wood energy power plants in 
the county. 
Humboldt County has three power 
plants that are primarily fueled by woody 
biomass: DG Fairhaven in Samoa, Blue 
Lake Power in Blue Lake, and Green Leaf 
(Eel River plant) in Scotia. Together, the 
plants have the ability to generate 54 
megawatts (MW) of electricity (table 1). 
However, in the recent past, the Blue Lake 
Power and Green Leaf power plants have 
shut down temporarily due to the low 
price of electricity, emission permit issues 
and the inability to secure supply at an 
economical price (Sims 2012). Even though 
competition for raw materials among 
these three power plants does not seem 
severe in this region, high demand for 
renewable energy (e.g., woody biomass) 
or entry of an additional competitor for 
fuel resources can lead to increased com-
petition for resources (Walter Nystrom, 
Blue Lake Power LLC, pers. comm.). 
Consequently, the second objective was

Forest residues are fed into a grinder at a centralized site and then loaded into a 
container for transport to the power plant. In Humboldt County, power plants use 
approximately 472,500 bone dry tons of biomass per year to generate electricity.

to understand the potential competition 
for wood residues within the wood-based 
power production industry. To address 
this objective, we obtained information on 
the market and supply of wood residues 
from personal interviews with industry 
professionals. 
The results provided by this study 
could be utilized by biomass contrac-
tors for maximizing their profit and for 
cost-effective delivery of wood residues 
from sawmills and timberlands to power 
plants. Furthermore, the methods de-
veloped for this study could easily be 
adapted to other locations where timber-
lands are actively managed and a strong 
forest products industry exists.
Data collection
All forested areas in the county, along 
with nine sawmills, were considered as 
potential wood residue sources. While 
the cost of acquiring sawmill residues 
was largely dependent on the transporta-
tion cost from sawmills to power plants, 
forest residues (tree tops, branches and 
non-merchantable whole trees) from tim-
berlands had variations in the operational 
costs associated with in-woods process-
ing, which were also considered. For this 
study, in-woods operational (stump-to-
truck) costs to harvest, process (grinding 
or chipping) and haul were based on typi-
cal practices for the region. 
Harvesting amounts and operational 
cost differences in the county have been 
directly influenced by the type of harvest-
ing methods used, which varied by land-
owner type (Hohl et al. 2013; Morgan et al. 
2012). Hence, using spatial data obtained 
from the Humboldt County Planning and 
Building Department, we classified the 
timberlands based on their ownership. 
Industrial timberlands were privately 
owned forests characterized by active 
forest management including timber 
harvesting. Land owned by tribal govern-
ments was also treated as industrial tim-
berland for this study, as it was managed 
similarly to privately owned forestland. In 
the national forests (Six Rivers, Klamath 
and Shasta-Trinity), biomass harvesting 
was typically conducted via relatively 
expensive thinning operations to achieve 
environmental benefits such as fire haz-
ard reduction and forest restoration. As a 
result, industrial timberlands generated 
forest residues at a lower stump-to-truck 
cost range of $26 to $30/BDT (Bisson et 
al. 2015; Harrill and Han 2012), while in 
the national forests, stump-to-truck bio-
mass costs were approximately $52/BDT 
(Vitorelo et al. 2011). Both of these costs 
represent the direct cost of the operation 
in the field and did not accommodate any 
allowance for mobilization of equipment, 
overhead or profit. 
Transportation model for biomass 
feedstocks
Forest residues. While primary trans-
portation (moving the forest residues 
from the stump to the landing, where the 
biomass is stacked and processed) was 
incorporated in the in-woods operational 
cost, secondary transportation (move-
ment of the forest residues from the land-
ing to the power plants) was modeled 
using road networks obtained from the 
U.S. Census’s Topologically Integrated 
Geographic Encoding and Referencing 
(TIGER) data set. The service area tool of 
ArcGIS (10.1) Network Analyst was used 
to model the area for secondary TCZs. 
Information on average travel speeds over 
different road types and associated costs 
for the region were gathered from exist-
ing literature (table 2). 
We assumed an average secondary 
transportation cost based on road types 
from a recent study in the region (Bisson 
et al. 2015) of 42-foot chip trailers carrying 
an average of 23.17 green tons of 25% 
moisture content wet basis hog fuel (wood 
chips and shavings). At this unit haul-
ing cost, the TCZ thresholds of $10/BDT, 
$20/BDT and $30/BDT fell at 20, 41 and 
61 miles. Each TCZ was associated with 
a range of costs: in the $30/BDT zone, the 
transportation cost ranged from $20.01 to 
$30.00/BDT based on a one-way distance 
between 41 and 61 miles. The TCZs were 
generalized to increments of $10; more 
refined TCZs (e.g., in increments of $1) 
would have complicated the model and 
yielded results with more or less the same 
utility.
To determine the actual area avail-
able for each power plant, we created two 
transportation networks: The inclusive 
transportation network, in which TCZs 
were classified based on the cost to pro-
vide biomass to any of the three plants 
(fig. 1); and the exclusive transportation 
network, in which the three power plants 
were considered individually to allocate 
the timberland available for each plant. 
The three exclusive TCZs were later inter-
sected with the respective three inclusive 
TCZs to determine the actual timberland 
available for each plant. This also helped 
in determining exclusive and shared tim-
berland zones (figs. 2 and 3). 
Exclusive timberland zones were re-
gions around a power plant from which

competing plants could not be supplied 
forest residues at lesser or equal price 
(with all conditions equal), due to the 
secondary transportation cost. Access to 
these timberlands could give the power 
plants an advantage if competition be-
came an issue. Overlapping timberlands 
were regions within the same TCZ of two 
or more plants (i.e., multiple plants could 
be supplied at approximately the same 
cost). We made the following assumptions 
for areas where TCZs overlapped:
1.	 The plant with lower TCZ claims the 
area over the plant with higher TCZ. 
For example, if 30 acres of timberland 
fell in both the exclusive network 
model of the $20/BDT zone of Green 
Leaf power plant and the $30/BDT 
zone of DG Fairhaven power plant, the 
region would be taken out of the total 
area of the $30/BDT zone for Fairhaven 
because Green Leaf could have the ma-
terial supplied at a lower cost.
2.	 When overlapping $/BDT TCZs are 
equal (shared timberland), the area is 
considered a “hot spot,” indicating a 
high risk of competition (fig. 2).
Hierarchical order was assigned to 
road type to give preference to existing

paved roads ($0.22/BDT-mile), gravel 
roads ($0.24/BDT-mile) and dirt roads 
(more than $0.64/BDT-mile) to reduce the 
cost of transportation (table 2). Each TCZ 
was later intersected with the timberland 
ownership data in order to exclude non-
timberlands and incorporate timberland 
ownerships into the TCZs.
Sawmill residues. The location-alloca-
tion tool of ArcGIS (10.1) Network Analyst 
was used to estimate the transportation 
cost associated with sawmills and evalu-
ate the relative advantage for each power 
plant to procure sawmill residues. This 
analysis is based on a proximity approach 
(competitive facility location) for esti-
mating market share (Drezner 2014). All 
facilities (sawmills) in the county were 
selected such that the allocated demand 
for transporting the sawmill residues to 
the power plant was maximized in the 
presence of competitors based on a spa-
tial interaction model (ESRI 2012). This 
method was used in determining the 
optimal sawmill(s), based on road types 
and distance, from which power plants 
could import sawmill residues within a 
maximum one-way haul distance of 61 
miles (W. Nystrom, pers. comm.). Based 
on the theory of duopoly in a linear mar-
ket situation, in which consumers (power 
plants) do not see any difference between 
the products (mill residues) sold by dif-
ferent producers (sawmills) and there is 
zero production cost for the producers 
(Drezner 2014; Hotelling 1929), Network 
Analyst created a weighting factor we 
called mill residue procurement (MRP) to 
assign the demand for sawmill residues 
from a particular sawmill to a power 
plant in the presence of competitors 
as a function of distance. Greater 
MRP implies a more favorable 
condition for obtaining sawmill 
residues for a particular plant. The 
sum of MRP for all sawmills reflects the 
overall advantage for a given power plant, 
relative to other plants, to procure avail-
able sawmill residues. 
TCZs for forest residues
$10/BDT zone. The $10/BDT TCZ was 
the region that provided forest residues 
from the timberlands at the lowest cost 
level due to proximity to the power plant. 
When stump-to-truck biomass costs were 
taken into account, more expensive forest 
residues close to a power plant were in 
many cases more economically feasible 
to procure than cheaper resources farther 
away. This zone included only industrial 
timberlands, with Green Leaf having the 
largest acreage (table 3). Our analysis of 
the risk for competition (fig. 2) showed 
that DG Fairhaven shared almost 53% 
of all its timberland with the other two 
plants (table 4), giving it little specific ad-
vantage in collecting forest residues over 
the other plants. Blue Lake and Green 
Leaf shared 15.5% and 2% of their tim-
berland with DG Fairhaven, respectively. 
While all the facilities had an exclusive

zone within this TCZ, Green Leaf had the 
largest exclusive area (table 4). 
$20/BDT zone. This zone had 709,565 
acres of total timberland, with 644,276 
acres of industrial timberlands (table 3). 
Approximately 17% of timberland was 
shared. Within this zone, DG Fairhaven 
had no exclusive timberland (fig. 3). 
Among the three TCZs, this zone had 
the highest acreage and supply of forest 
residues. 
$30/BDT zone. The $30/BDT TCZ is 
currently regarded as the outer limit for 
cost-effective procurement. Given the cur-
rent cost of supply and market price for 
biomass in Humboldt County, this zone 
would typically generate zero profit mar-
gins for biomass contractors supplying 
the raw material, unless additional com-
pensations were offered (e.g., government 
subsidies). In this zone, feasibility was 
highly dependent on hauling distance. 
Supplies from TCZs 
Industrial timberlands constituted 86% 
of the 1,566,683 acres of timberland within 
the three TCZs (table 3). The $30/BDT 
TCZ had a smaller area and supply of for-
est residues than the $20/BDT TCZ for the 
following reasons:
1.	 The $30/BDT TCZ was smaller than 
anticipated because much of the poten-
tial land base in this zone was actually 
in the ocean.
2.	 A large proportion of the acreage fall-
ing in the $30/BDT exclusive TCZ 
overlapped with the inclusive $20/BDT 
zone of other plants and had to be 
removed from the former TCZ and 
added to the latter.
3.	 Our analysis was carried out exclu-
sively for Humboldt County. Much 
of the timberland outside the county 
that would have been in the $30/BDT 
zone was not included. However, even 
if these regions outside the county 
within the $30/BDT were considered, 
transportation would still not be fea-
sible in the current market. 
4.	 The $30/BDT TCZ had the highest 
amount of national forest acreage, al-
most 31% (table 3), compared to 9% in 
the $20/BDT TCZ.
 Procurement of sawmill residues
Sawmill residues added an additional 
408,000 BDT annually to the local sup-
ply of wood residues (Hohl et al. 2013). 
Unlike forest residues that were seasonal 
in nature, residues from sawmills could 
potentially be available all year long. 
Furthermore, this resource was less ex-
pensive ($10/BDT) when compared to the 
forest residues ($50/BDT) (Mayhead and 
Shelly 2012). 
Results from the location-allocation 
analysis showed that DG Fairhaven had 
the greatest competitive advantage in 
collecting their mill residues, followed 
by Blue Lake (table 5). DG Fairhaven had 
the least acreage of exclusive timberland 
(26,278 acres) (table 4) and depended pri-
marily on sawmills for its supply (Bob 
Marino, DG Fairhaven Power LLC, pers. 
comm.). Blue Lake, with a total MRP of 
3.07, also received most of its supply from 
sawmills (W. Nystrom, pers. comm.). 
Transportation model economics
Approximately 303,000 BDT of forest 
residues are available from Humboldt 
County’s timberlands annually (Hohl et 
al. 2013). The U.S. Department of Energy

reported $47/BDT as a target delivered 
feedstock price for 2012 to make biomass-
based processes competitive with fossil 
fuel-based energy production (Wilkerson 
et al. 2008). Of this, the agency allocated 
$10/BDT to the landowner, leaving 
$37/BDT for collection and transportation 
(Greene et al. 2011). 
In Humboldt County, the wood resi-
dues supplied to the power plant were 
priced around $50/BDT (W. Nystrom, 
pers. comm.). In the $30/BDT TCZ, there 
was only room to accommodate $20 to 
$30/BDT for the rest of the biomass har-
vesting operation. However, the stump-
to-truck cost in industrial timberlands 
could account for about $26/BDT for 
biomass recovery operations (Bisson et al. 
2015) and $30/BDT for biomass harvesting 
along with sawlog operations in Northern 
California (Harrill and Han 2012). Costs 
for mobilization of equipment, overhead 
and profit allowance were not included 
in the stump-to-truck cost figures. Hence, 
under present market conditions, we do 
not expect that contractors will operate 
outside the $30/BDT TCZ, especially in 
the three national forests, unless they are 
compensated in addition to the price paid 
by the power plant. 
However, major industrial landowners 
often do compensate biomass contrac-
tors to remove forest residues from their 
property due to fire hazards and site 
preparation requirements. In Humboldt 
County’s national forests, compensation 
has taken the form of stewardship funds 
or other grants for reducing the hazard-
ous fuel loads and promoting biomass 
energy; the funds paid for long distance 
travel costs and allowed contractors to 
profitably supply woody biomass. There 
are similar examples from neighboring 
Siskiyou County, where biomass suppli-
ers have delivered raw materials to power 
plants almost 75 miles away (Jim Johnson, 
Jim Johnson Logging, pers. comm.). In 
addition, a decrease in in-woods opera-
tional costs or fuel costs, or an increase in 
market price, could open up more areas 
for utilization. Harrill and Han (2012) 
found that a $1/gallon increase in the 
price of diesel could result in a $2.06/BDT 
increase in the stump-to-truck costs as-
sociated with a woody biomass project 
in Northern California; correspondingly, 
a drop in the fuel price would reduce 
stump-to-truck costs. 
To evaluate the total cost of delivery 
(round-trip) from timberlands to power 
plants, we conducted a sensitivity analy-
sis using a unit cost of $0.24/BDT-mile 
(Bisson et al. 2015) on distance traveled 
and the stump-to-truck biomass cost 
(table 6). As the stump-to-truck cost in-
creased, the accessible distance to the 
timberlands decreased, and total delivery 
cost increased. Furthermore, this analysis 
confirmed that within a given TCZ, profit 
margins for contractors are directly de-
termined by the type and efficiency of 
operation. 
Competition for wood residues
Areas at high risk of competition, or 
hot spots, were identified throughout the 
county based on transportation distance 
and road types. The $20/BDT TCZ was 
subject to more competition among the 
power plants because it had the highest 
percentage of timberland shared (17%) 
(table 4). A contractor working within this 
area had the choice to supply forest resi-
dues to any of the power plants sharing 
the region. Competition can be further 
intensified by an increase in a plant’s 
capacity or the entry of an additional 
biomass consumer, such as another bioen-
ergy facility, a pulp mill, or compost and 
mulching facilities. 
In Humboldt County, Blue Lake Power 
shut down for almost a decade before be-
ing re-commissioned in 2009; its closure 
was attributed to an increase in price of 
biomass feedstock and decrease in the 
price of electricity (W. Nystrom, pers. 
comm.). In addition, when the Green Leaf 
power plant temporarily shut down in 
2012, the company stated that the primary 
reason for the shutdown was “inability to 
secure stable fuel supplies” (Sims 2012). 
These cases show that the wood residue 
utilizers in the county were facing a 
shortage of raw materials at an economi-
cal price (W. Nystrom, pers. comm.). It 
should also be noted that Green Leaf, 
located in the southern portion of the bio-
mass power production hub, had almost 
692,172 acres of exclusive timberland zone

within the first three TCZs, making it the 
largest holder of exclusive timberland 
(table 4). However, because forest biomass 
harvesting operations were seasonal, in 
some cases operating roughly 100 days 
per year mainly due to weather conditions 
(Steve Morris, Steve Morris Logging, pers. 
comm.), power plants could not entirely 
depend on this resource. DG Fairhaven, 
which has the highest total MRP, did not 
need to shut down even though it had the 
least acreage of exclusive zone. Being the 
oldest plant in the region, the plant could 
secure long-term contracts with sawmills 
for stable feedstock supplies. 
Having the highest average distance 
to the sawmills, the total MRP for Green 
Leaf was much lower than the MRP for 
the other two power plants (table 5); as a 
result, the plant had to pay comparatively 
more to access mill residues produced 
in the county. However, all three power 
plants were within an economically feasi-
ble distance to sawmills. Further analysis 
on competition, such as a target market 
share analysis, could have revealed more 
information on the supply chain based 
on the type of sawmill residues produced 
and total production. Additionally, the 
analysis used distance (miles) as the 
determining factor rather than “time” 
because the latter required historic traffic 
data that was not available for Humboldt 
County.
Exclusive timberland zones were cre-
ated to understand a power plant’s sup-
ply advantage compared to others. The 
zone was determined by extracting areas 
that were not shared by the other power 
plants (or was solely available to a par-
ticular power plant) within each TCZ. The 
$10/BDT TCZ had the highest percentage 
of exclusive land (91.7%) compared to 
the total acreage in the TCZ, whereas the 
$20 BDT/TCZ had most land coverage 
(table 4). 
However, given the annual produc-
tion of wood residues in the county of 
over 711,000 BDT and a total power plant 
consumption of around 472,500 BDT/year, 
the market is relatively safe from competi-
tion at present (W. Nystrom, pers. comm.). 
Furthermore, major industrial timberland 
owners in the county have indicated that 
they could generate up to three times 
more if there was demand (Ewald 2013).
Extending the results
The transportation cost zone concepts 
developed in this study could be applied 
to other locations where more than one 
power plant competes for the same raw 
materials.
Traditionally, forest residues are 
grinded, chipped, bundled or crushed 
to increase bulk density and enhance 
the transportation efficiency. Apart from 
these, new evolving technologies that 
densify woody biomass, such as torrefac-
tion, briquetting and densification, can 
significantly increase the energy value of 
the raw materials. These energy-densified 
products could thereby extend the TCZ 
up to 100 miles (Mayhead 2010).  c
