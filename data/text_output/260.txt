Dr. Wally Covington takes reporters into the ﬁeld at the experimental forest in Gus
Pearson Natural Area.
Dr. Wally Covington on Reveal Podcast
This past summer, reporters from the Center for Investigative Reporting (CIR)
visited the Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI) at Northern Arizona University
for a story on wildﬁres. ERI Executive Director Dr. Wally Covington took the
team of journalists and radio producers to Gus Pearson Natural Area, an
experimental forest north of Flagstaff, Arizona for a crash course on the
science of restoration.
 
Dr. Covington’s interview appears on the nationally syndicated Reveal podcast,
which is produced by the CIR. The episode is titled “America’s ring of ﬁre” and
is a deep dive into the growing ﬁre problem throughout the West. It examines
how wildﬁres got so dangerous and how communities are working to protect
themselves. A complementary print piece, “When spark meets sprawl: Building

in wildlands increases ﬁre risk,” includes a 360-degree video of a thinning
project by the City of Flagstaff’s Wildland Fire Management. Both the podcast
and article spotlight work at national and local levels to protect communities
from wildﬁre and create healthy, resilient forests.

Frequent-Fire Forests of the Rocky Mountain West. Arizona State Law Journal,

This paper discusses the causes of forest health decline and advocates for
ecological restoration as an approach for restoring forest health. It also
summarizes recent policy changes with the stated purpose to accelerate
restoration and provide economic validation for why restoration is the smartest
approach for reducing the threat of catastrophic ﬁre.

This systematic review of relevant literature sought to answer the question of

To improve the knowledge of ecosystem dynamics within frequent-ﬁre forests
and to develop targets for forest restoration, researchers used
dendrochronological reconstructions and spatial analyses to quantify historical
and contemporary tree densities, species compositions, and ﬁne-scale spatial
patterns in dry mixed-conifer forests of the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.

Long-term changes in stand-level functional traits are not as well understood as
changes in forest structure and composition. The objective of this study was to
assess century-long changes in overstory forest composition, structure, and
functional diversity in a warm/dry mixed conifer forest. Researchers analyzed
four traits that reﬂect important characteristics of species adapted to semi-arid,
frequent-ﬁre ecosystems.

ERI Science Delivery and Outreach News
By Amy Waltz, Director of Science Delivery
The ERI continued to conduct outreach with our southwestern region’s forests
in 2016, but also reorganized to combine agency outreach with our broader
science delivery to West-wide and national audiences. A few highlights across
this broad program of work include:
 
National Collaboration Restoration Workshop, Denver, CO, April 2016.

The ERI worked closely with the National Forest Foundation (NFF) and the
U.S. Forest Service (USFS) Washington Ofﬁce to sponsor and provide
guidance on the workshop steering committee and speciﬁc topical tracts for this
workshop. Outcomes can be found hosted by the NFF online.
USFS Region 2 and 3 Broader-Scale Monitoring Project. The ERI worked
with our sister institutes in Colorado and New Mexico, and USFS Regions 2
and 3 to develop a framework for a Broader-Scale Monitoring Strategy. This is
a new element of the 2012 planning rule and requires regions to monitor at
scales broader than one administrative unit.
 
Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI) Science and Planning Support.
ERI Science Delivery staff, with our Policy and Partnership and Research and
Development staff, all work to support the 4FRI collaborative stakeholder
process and USFS planning team providing stakeholder leadership support
(co-chair and small-group chairs) and technical support to identify monitoring
needs and ﬁll monitoring gaps. We continue to work closely to assess the
implementation of the ﬁrst Environmental Impact Study area, while contributing
science support to the second planning area.
 
Forest Projects. The ERI science delivery team worked closely with USFS
Region 3 forests on a variety of project-level questions and science needs
assessments. Together with USFS staff, the ERI worked on a treatment
comparison on the Coconino National Forest; pre-project assessments on the
Apache-Sitgreaves and Prescott national forests; and restoration
demonstration sites on the Coronado and Carson national forests. We also are
working with the forest planning process on the Tonto National Forest.

Research and Development
2016 Summer Field Season Overview
By ERI R&D Staff
 
In partnership with the U.S. Forest Service, ERI ﬁeld crews collected data on
three studies that will greatly enhance our knowledge of ecosystems
following wildﬁre and managed ﬁres. On the ﬁfth anniversary of the Wallow
Fire, the largest wildﬁre in Arizona history, we teamed up with the Apache-
Sitgreaves National Forest to determine if fuel reduction treatments in
dry mixed-conifer forests prior to the ﬁre had a measurable effect on ecosystem
attributes such as tree survival and regeneration, resistance to attacks by pine
bark beetles, fuel loadings and changes in the plant community.
 
Field crews spent much of the summer on the Tusayan Ranger District of the
Kaibab National Forest collecting data on a 30,000-acre landscape that has
experienced multiple, overlapping naturally ignited wildﬁres (managed wildﬁres)
over much of the area. These data, combined with data collected last year on
single ﬁre areas in the same landscape, will be used to test the efﬁcacy of
managed wildﬁres in meeting forest restoration goals.
 
Twenty-four plots, originally installed and measured prior to the 2001 Leroux
Fire, were remeasured. This was the second time these plots have been
remeasured since the ﬁre, giving us pre-ﬁre, one-year and 15-year post-ﬁre
data. Little is known about the long-term dynamics of burned-over mixed-
conifer forests. The data that were collected will help to better understand how

ﬁre severity and climate interact to affect changes in species composition and
vegetation structure.
