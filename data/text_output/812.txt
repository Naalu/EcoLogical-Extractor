Abstract
Increases in revegetation activities have created a large
demand for locally adapted native plant materials (NPM)
in the southwestern United States. Currently, there is a
minimal supply of local genotypes to meet this demand.
We investigated the potential for the initiation of a native
plant market in the southern Colorado Plateau. Through
a literature search, interviews, and site visits, we identiﬁed
existing native plant markets outside of the region as useful
models to help initiate a regional market. We used web-
based surveys to identify and analyze current and future
NPM needs and concerns. Survey results indicate that
management policy strongly drives decisions regarding the
use and purchase of NPM. From a demand perspective,
lack of availability and cost of NPM has kept purchas-
ing minimal, despite policy changes favoring the use of
natives. For suppliers, further development of NPM is lim-
ited by inconsistent and unreliable demand and lack of
production knowledge. The knowledge and tools necessary
to initiate an NPM market are available, but inadequate
funding sources and insufﬁcient information sharing hin-
der its development. Communication among producers,
land managers, buyers, and researchers, as well as part-
nerships with local growers, appear to be vital to initiating
a functional market.
Key words: local genotype, market perception differences,
native plant market, native plant policy, web-based survey.
Introduction
Over the past century, in the Southwest, land use and
management practices in conjunction with changing climate
conditions have led to alteration of native ecosystems and a
ﬁre regime shift from frequent, low-intensity surface ﬁres to
large high-intensity crown ﬁres (Covington & Moore 1994;
Westerling et al. 2006). Many native species in southwestern
Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws. (ponderosa pine) forests are
well adapted to periodic drought and ﬁres of low intensity
(Hunter & Omi 2006). However, drought conditions and
wildﬁres are projected to increase in the region (McKenzie
et al. 2004; Westerling et al. 2006; Seager et al. 2007). As a
result, prolonged drought stress and a changing ﬁre regime
may have direct effects on local plant community composition
and structure (Hanson & Weltzin 2000; Wang & Kemball
2005; Hunter & Omi 2006). In light of these concerns, interest

in restoring these disturbed lands has become more widespread
(Allen et al. 2002; McKay et al. 2005).
In recent years with major ﬁres such as the 2000 Cerro
Grande and the 2002 Rodeo-Chediski, wildﬁres have arguably
become the primary driver of restoration and rehabilitation
efforts in the Southwest (Friederici 2003). Land management
agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and U.S.
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) are required to prescribe
emergency watershed-rehabilitation measures when and where
deemed necessary to: (1) stabilize soil; (2) control water, sed-
iment, and debris movement; (3) prevent ecosystem degra-
dation; and (4) minimize threats to human life or property.
Among post-ﬁre rehabilitation treatments, grass seeding is the
most commonly used and cost-effective method to stabilize
soils and establish ground cover for erosion control (Richards
et al. 1998; Robichaud et al. 2000; Beyers 2004; Wolfson &
Sieg in press) on ﬁrelines and hillslope areas determined to
require protection.
In Arizona and New Mexico, both the area burned by
wildﬁre and the funding allocated for post-ﬁre seeding have
increased dramatically in the last 30 years (Wolfson & Sieg in
press, Fig. 1). Regionally, seed used for post-ﬁre seeding has
shifted from mixes dominated by perennial non-native species
to mixes incorporating more native species (Wolfson & Sieg
in press), although non-natives are still used. Beyond post-
wildﬁre rehabilitation, revegetation is an integral component
of other land management practices in the region including

invasive species management, livestock grazing, wildlife habi-
tat management, roadside rehabilitation, mine reclamation, and
recreational use.
Within the last 30 years, revegetation policies have increas-
ingly stressed using native plant materials (NPM), and more
recently, recognized the importance of using locally adapted
NPM during restoration and rehabilitation activities (Richards
et al. 1998; Erickson 2008). However, although national poli-
cies for federal land management agencies such as the USFS
and BLM direct the use of native plant species as a ﬁrst choice
in revegetation activities, non-native species may be used when
using native species is deemed impractical (Richards et al.
1998; Soller 2003; Beyers 2004); for example, in emergency
conditions to protect resource values or when NPM are not
available or economically feasible (Erickson 2008). Conse-
quently, non-native species continue to be used in revegetation
projects throughout the region, often due to the increasing need
for post-ﬁre emergency rehabilitation in conjunction with the
lack of availability and high cost of NPM (Wolfson & Sieg,
in press) that are locally adapted and genetically compatible
with existing plant populations (Rogers & Montalvo 2004)
(hereafter “local genotypes”).
New revegetation policies and funding sources have
emerged as a result of increased recognition from Congress of
the need for an abundant supply of NPM and the establishment
of the Federal Interagency NPM Development Committee in
2000 (USDA & USDI 2002). Since 2000, interagency projects
have been developed to meet the need for increased NPM
availability and production information (Pellant et al. 2004;
Shaw et al. 2005). Unfortunately, only minimal efforts cur-
rently exist in the Southwest and, due to the lack of local
genotypes available, federal, state, tribal, nonproﬁt, and private
entities presently purchase restoration materials from distant
sources. Thus, regional projects continually incorporate non-
local genetic materials which may be more susceptible to the
negative effects of changing environments (Huenneke 1991;
Schmid 1994; Rogers & Montalvo 2004) and threaten the
long-term sustainability of restored sites (Lynch 1991; Huf-
ford & Mazer 2003), as well as other local populations (Linhart
1995; Montalvo & Ellstrand 2001) with which they may inter-
breed.
With NPM production efforts currently established in sur-
rounding regions, increased policy recognizing the value of
using NPM, and needs for locally adapted plant supplies, mar-
ket opportunities exist that may directly beneﬁt the southern
Colorado Plateau’s diverse ecosystems. This study addresses
the following four questions: (1) Could native plant markets
outside of the region serve as models to guide the devel-
opment of an NPM market in the region? (2) What role
does current policy play on the use and demand for NPM?
(3) What are the needs and concerns of both supply and
demand stakeholders involved with NPM? (4) What factors
limit the initiation of an NPM market in the southern Colorado
Plateau?

Methods
This study assesses the opportunity to initiate a native plant
and seed industry in the southern Colorado Plateau (Fig. 2). To
explore market development methodologies and perceptions,
we investigated existing native plant markets and adminis-
tered web-based surveys to natural resource professionals and
selected seed companies in the southern Colorado Plateau and
in nearby regions.
To identify potential models which could be used to help
guide the development of a regionally based NPM market,
we reviewed current literature including scientiﬁc articles,
unpublished theses and reports, and government documents.
We then interviewed natural resource professionals within the
region to gain further insight on markets previously identiﬁed.
The most relevant markets were selected based on their
similarity to the southern Colorado Plateau’s size and market
demands.
We developed two distinct web-based surveys to assess
current native plant market perceptions. A demand survey
was administered to a target group of individuals from
federal, state, private, and nonproﬁt entities who were actively
involved in restoration in the region (Table 1(a)). A supply
survey was administered to a targeted group of individuals
from both large- and small-scale seed production companies in
Arizona, New Mexico, nearby western and Great Plains states,
and other successful seed production companies (Table 1(b)).
Complete details on the survey methodology are available
from the authors.
We developed 42 questions for the demand survey and 37
questions for the supply survey based on preliminary infor-
mation from interviews and current literature (Richards et al.
1998; Hooper 2003; Soller 2003). Each survey question was
arranged into a series of related survey questions and placed
within ﬁve thematic areas pertaining to NPM: (1) policy
and regulation; (2) issues and concerns; (3) future use and

(42 demand and 39 supply) online (Andrews et al. 2003;
Kaplowitz et al. 2004; Ryu et al. 2005) using the web tool
SurveyMonkey (www.surveymonkey.com).
Analysis of ﬁnal survey response datasets was completed
using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) soft-
ware (SPSS 2007). We calculated survey answer frequencies
(n) and valid percents of respondent participation for each
question. Survey responses “Don’t know” and “Decline to
answer” are not included in the valid percent calculations.
For questions that offered multiple responses, total percent-
ages may exceed 100. Percents are rounded, which may cause
totals to be slightly greater or less than 100%.
Results
Model Markets
We identiﬁed the BLM Great Basin Restoration Initiative’s
(GBRI) Great Basin Native Plant Selection and Increase
Project (GB Project), and the Uncompahgre Plateau Project’s
Native Plant Program (UP Project) as useful models for guid-
ing the development of a native plant market in the south-
ern Colorado Plateau. Within their respective regions, these
projects have helped to increase the supply of NPM for restora-
tion practices through multi-organizational collaborations and
partnerships with private growers (Pellant et al. 2004; U.S.
GAO 2008a). Funding provided to the projects is used, in
part, to conduct research on key native plant species to develop
critical production methodologies and seed sources. Research
results and information are then transferred to growers and
land managers. In addition, growers are given an opportunity
to participate in buy-back programs, which aim to encourage
suppliers to grow native species not yet marketed (Shaw et al.
2005; UP Project 2007). Under the buy-back program, mini-
mal amounts of stock seed, along with associated production
information is provided to growers under an agreement that the
projects will buy back a small portion of the seed produced
for distribution to additional growers or in some cases to pro-
vide NPM for research needs. Meanwhile, growers are given a
chance to sell the additional seed produced on the open market.
Within the Great Basin, market demands are primarily
driven by needs of government agencies for post-ﬁre rehabil-
itation and restoration (GBRI 2001). Funded entirely through
the BLM GBRI, total 5-year funding for the GB Project was
approximately $4.5–6 million between 2001 and 2006 (GBRI
2001; Pellant 2006). On the Uncompahgre Plateau, although
market demands are driven by private and public land needs
for habitat improvement, NPM production focuses on provid-
ing local-source seed for government agency use. The UP
Project, which was modeled after the GB Project, has a sep-
arate nonproﬁt management group as well as a formalized
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the BLM, USFS,
and the Colorado Division of Wildlife which allows the group
to receive both direct and in-kind funding from federal, state,
private, and nonproﬁt entities (U.S. GAO 2008a). Additional
funding provides ﬁnancial support to local growers for pro-
ducing NPM. Between 2002 and 2007, the program received
approximately $2.4 million in funding, with the majority com-
ing from the BLM (50%) and the USFS (35%) (UP Project
2007). Based on annual operating costs for both the GB
and UP Projects, the estimated cost for collection, research,
increase, and release is approximately $15,000–25,000 per
species annually and requires approximately 4–12 years to
develop a species (CPNPI 2007).
Survey
We received 37 completed demand (88% response rate) and
33 completed supply (85% response rate) surveys from the
targeted sample group. Due to nonrandom sample selection
and a small sample size (demand survey n = 42 and supply
survey n = 39), extrapolation of results and conclusions to
a larger population should be considered cautiously (Babbie
2004); however, an effort was made to include all involved
stakeholders.
The majority of demand survey respondents were employed
by “federal” or “state” agencies (47 and 27%, respectively),
and currently implemented seeding as a management practice
(83%). Of supply survey respondents, 94% were currently
involved in selling NPM of which the majority (97%) sold
either “native seed” solely (32%) or NPM and non-native
seed (65%).
Native Plant Policy and Regulation.
Demand respondents
indicated that “organization policy” (25%) followed by “avail-
ability of native seed” (21%) were the most important factors
inﬂuencing the purchase of native seed. The majority (80%)
of respondents’ organizations or agencies currently required
the use of certiﬁed native seed; seed meeting certiﬁcation

procedures which provide veriﬁcation of source, genetic iden-
tity, and genetic purity of wildland collected or ﬁeld grown
plant germplasm materials (AOSCA 2003). For those orga-
nizations or agencies that did not currently require the use
of certiﬁed native seed, 67% of the respondents anticipated
requirements to do so within the next 5 years.
Native Plant Material Concerns.
The majority of all respon-
dents (65%) found deﬁning the term “local genotype” difﬁcult
and suggested the deﬁnition is species speciﬁc and highly
dependent upon topography, elevation, and climatic condi-
tions within a region. In follow-up questions, an overwhelming
majority of buyers (93%) indicated that their organization was
concerned about the genetic source of native seed; yet 41% of
respondents used non-native seeds in restoration efforts. Half
of demand respondents agreed “lack of availability” was the
primary limiting factor preventing their organization from buy-
ing local seeds and “availability” (27%) along with the “cost”
(22%) of seed were the greatest obstacles to overcome in order
to initiate a successful NPM market in the southern Colorado
Plateau (Fig. 3a). The majority of buyers (87%) foresaw a
need for local genotypes for seeding practices within the next
5 years.
Producing local genotypes was “somewhat” (47%) or “very
important” (33%) to suppliers and the majority (70%) agreed
that there is a current market for local genotypes used in large-
scale restoration projects. However, suppliers commented that
supplying local genotypes is difﬁcult due to the costs and
limited resources available during the wildland seed harvesting
and agricultural seed production process. In addition, growers
were more interested in supplying seed that is currently in large
demand. Furthermore, from the supply perspective, the “lack
of consistent and reliable demand” (38%), and “knowledge
of native plant production” (21%) were the most signiﬁcant
limitations to supplying NPM (Fig. 3b).

(Arizona fescue), Elymus elymoides (Raf.) Swezey (squir-
reltail), Atriplex canescens (Pursh) Nutt. (fourwing saltbush),
and Poa fendleriana (Steud.) Vasey (muttongrass). In contrast,
among all responses from suppliers (n = 53), the ﬁve species
for seeds in highest demand (19% of the total responses),
in order of frequency were: Pseudoroegneria spicata (Pursh)
A. L¨ove (bluebunch wheatgrass), Achnatherum hymenoides
(Roem. & Schult.) Barkworth (Indian ricegrass), Pascopyrum
smithii (Rydb.) A. L¨ove (western wheatgrass), Elymus lanceo-
latus (Scribn. & J.G. Sm.) Gould (thickspike wheatgrass), and
Elymus elymoides. Overall, seed of grass species was in highest
demand by both demand and supply respondents, but only Ely-
mus elymoides was listed among the top ﬁve by both groups;
this difference in plant lists was a direct result of buyers and
suppliers being surveyed in different geographic areas.
Native Plant Material Purchasing and Expenditures.
The
BLM spent the most on NPM in 2006, followed by the USFS
(Fig. 3d). In 2006, the top two management activities for
which native seed was purchased included “burned area reha-
bilitation” and “ecological restoration.” However, 61% of all
the native seed purchased was for burned area rehabilitation

activities (10,843 kg), amounting to 42% of the overall expen-
ditures on native seed in 2006 ($344,000, Fig. 4). According to
the demand survey, almost half (44%) of respondents’ native
seed supply came from out-of-state sources within the same
ecological region in which the rehabilitation or restoration was
conducted (e.g., Great Basin, Colorado Plateau, etc.)
Collaboration and Funding.
Among buyers, collaboration
occurred most often between “federal” (22%) and “state”
agencies (20%). Over one-half (57%) of buyers currently
received “federal” or “state” monies or incentives to assist with
seeding practices. Most suppliers’ (62%) current native plant
operations are supported internally, while one-third (33%) are
supported by both internal and external funding.
Discussion
Market models and survey results revealed that many factors
limit an NPM market in the southern Colorado Plateau,
including the need for: (1) stronger collaboration among
federal, state, private, and nonproﬁt entities; (2) increased
communication among seed producers, land managers, buyers,
and researchers; (3) funding mechanisms for development of
local genotype plant materials; (4) an agreement regarding
the scale of “local genotypes”; (5) increased availability and
reduced costs of local genotypes; and (6) native plant market
stability.
The GB and UP Projects are useful models in guiding
development of an NPM market in the southern Colorado
Plateau. These projects provide a framework of how factors
related to limited collaboration, insufﬁcient funding, and
lack of communication can be overcome. It appears that
multiagency collaboration can be used to acquire long-term
funding sources needed to increase NPM development. These
models suggest that between $2.4 and $6 million over a 5-year
period is needed to initiate a similar project in the southern
Colorado Plateau (GBRI 2001; Pellant 2006; UP Project 2007).
Partnerships between government agencies and private
growers appear to be essential as improved information shar-
ing and buy-back options give growers tools and incen-
tives needed to enhance development of NPM. Beyond
buy-back options, stewardship contracting, available through
the BLM and USFS, authorizes these agencies to enter into
long-term agreements (up to 10 years) with communities,
private sectors, and others to meet land management objec-
tives associated with improving forest and rangeland health
while beneﬁting communities (U.S. GAO 2008b). Indeﬁnite-
delivery/indeﬁnite-quantity contracts (which agree to award
payment upon completion of speciﬁed tasks in a ﬁxed period
of time) have also been used by the BLM and USFS in several
western states to produce required quantities of seed from spe-
ciﬁc areas for planned projects (Erickson 2008; 2009, USDA
Forest Service, personal communication). Utilizing contracting
options provided through the USFS and BLM would further
encourage market development.
Our survey indicates that policy strongly inﬂuences agency
decisions regarding NPM use. Due in part to difﬁculties inter-
preting current native plant policy and economic constraints,
federal policy on use of NPM has been implemented errat-
ically (Richards et al. 1998) and in the southern Colorado
Plateau, lack of availability and high costs of local genotypes
have made existing native plant policies moot, thereby allow-
ing the continued use of non-native species (Wolfson & Sieg
in press). Stronger and more consistent policies for their use
Restoration Ecology

Perceptions and Opportunities for Native Plant Production
(Richards et al. 1998) could enhance the regions’ NPM mar-
ket potential by helping to increase their demand. For example,
implementation of stronger native plant policies has stimulated
the development of new certiﬁed seed categories that accom-
modate the use of native plant germplasm (Jones & Young
2005). According to current literature (Loftin 2004; Jones &
Young 2005), many states have adopted seed certiﬁcation poli-
cies speciﬁcally accommodating NPM and, because of this,
suppliers now offer certiﬁed native seed as the demand for it
has increased.
According to the survey, the genetic source of seed appears
to be a concern for land managers and seed companies, yet
an inconsistent demand and lack of reliable production knowl-
edge make suppliers hesitant in furthering the development of
local genotype plant materials. These issues are further com-
plicated by difﬁculties in determining what constitutes a “local
genotype” (Mortlock 1999; Burton & Burton 2002; Williams
& Price 2002) as well as by varying requests for species,
types of genetic materials, and amounts needed. Confusion
over these issues creates dilemmas for suppliers when faced
with deciding on what types and how much material to pro-
duce and market (Hooper 2003). Determining target species,
ﬁnding common ground on the genetic classiﬁcation of local
plant materials, and consolidating NPM requests are critical
ﬁrst steps to effectively build a regional NPM market and
developing local genotype plant materials.
One approach to the “local genotype” scale issue is to delin-
eate seed transfer zones based upon geographic and elevational
boundaries in which plant materials can be transferred with
little risk of being poorly adapted (Mahalovich & McArthur
2004; Aubry et al. 2005). Forested areas of Arizona and New
Mexico are already divided into 10 physiographic-climatic tree
seed zones (Schubert & Pitcher 1973), which could be used
as surrogates for grass seed transfer zones (Soller 2003). Con-
sistent funding for research and development will be needed
to enable completion of research projects exploring the basic
genetic information for determining appropriate seed collec-
tion zones.
According to the survey, suppliers appear to lack the
knowledge necessary to successfully produce NPM. Over the
years a wealth of information has been accumulated regarding
NPM production. Within the region, increased information
transfer regarding available production guidelines (Potts et al.
2002) would further encourage potential suppliers to grow
needed NPM. Greater information sharing may also help to
lower NPM costs by providing suppliers with cost-effective
production techniques. Minimal research may be needed to
develop production guidelines for regionally speciﬁc species
for which information is not available.
According to our survey results, focusing on grass seed pro-
duction will be important during the market initiation phase.
Demand for grass species is promising as the majority of
research on NPM production has focused on development of
grass species (Robichaud et al. 2000). Many of the desirable
grass species identiﬁed are readily available through commer-
cial seed producers outside the region. Therefore, focusing on
producing and marketing locally collected and grown grass

species (e.g. specialty market) could alleviate competition
pressure from non-regional suppliers.
Specialty NPM markets have been assessed in Nevada and
created in Utah. In 2005, the Nevada Wildland Seed Producers
Association requested a feasibility study to evaluate the poten-
tial for a native plant and seed market, as well as interests in
forming a cooperative among Nevada NPM producers (Curtis
et al. 2005). Within this cooperative, 30 producers each invest
approximately $5,000 and obtain additional funding through
credit or loan options to ﬁnance the cooperative start-up cost.
Proﬁts are made by marketing locally developed, certiﬁed,
and labeled “Nevada Grown” materials. This study estimated
total operational expenses at approximately $6 million annu-
ally. Utah Intermountain Native Plant Growers Association
produced a similar market for “Utah Choice” NPM (Meyer
2005). The Nevada and Utah NPM markets appear to be pri-
marily supported by demand for NPM for ﬁre prevention and
rehabilitation efforts (Curtis et al. 2005; Meyer 2005).
Burned area rehabilitation plays a large role in the demand
for and purchase of NPM in the southern Colorado Plateau,
speciﬁcally grasses used for post-ﬁre seeding (Beyers 2004;
Wolfson & Sieg in press). Our survey indicates that the BLM
followed by the USFS purchase the majority of the seed in the
region and according to agency policy the use of native species
is preferred (USDA & USDI 2002). The total burned area that
has been seeded within USFS Region 3 has increased annually
since 1990 (Table 2). Assuming that policies continue to favor
seeding following disturbance, a future native plant market
may continue to be driven by federal government demand for
post-ﬁre seeding materials, and more speciﬁcally those which
are native.
The variable demand for NPM results from unpredictable
ﬁre frequency and size (Richards et al. 1998; USDA & USDI
2002; Jones & Young 2005). The unpredictability of ﬁres from

year to year can cause high demands for large quantities of
native grass seed at short notice, and often at a time when
NPM supplies are low (Dunne & Dunne 2003). In turn this
forces buyers to purchase materials from outside the region
(Curtis et al. 2005) at high costs (Dunne & Dunne 2003).
Increasing the region’s storage capacity (USDA & USDI 2002;
Soller 2003) may be one way to address issues of on-demand
availability and alleviate high market prices often associated
with native seed in short supply (Jones & Young 2005).
Adequate long-term seed storage facilities would allow for
seed to be purchased and stored in favorable seed production
years (USDA & USDI 2002; Williams & Price 2002; Soller
2003). This would stabilize availability during unfavorable
seasons (Mortlock 1998) or in heavy ﬁre years. However,
suppliers answering the survey stressed that providing NPM
for an unreliable market is often infeasible and that it is more
proﬁtable to produce and sell NPM which have the highest
consistent demand. Moreover, suppliers surveyed expressed
that lack of funding is a major obstacle in providing native
seed, which is often limited due to the greater costs associated
with collecting and producing it (Mortlock 1998; Burton &
Burton 2002). Forms of contracting may be necessary to assure
growers that the seed they produce will be purchased and, in
some instances, provide them with seed stock accompanied
by associated production information. A synergistic approach
of increasing storage capacity while offering suppliers market
incentives may provide an effective mechanism to increase the
supply of needed NPM within the region.
What is Needed for Market Initiation?
A diverse approach is needed to overcome the many chal-
lenges of initiating an NPM market in the southern Colorado
Plateau. Based on the GB Project and the UP Project, greater
collaboration, funding opportunities, and communication are
essential to increasing NPM. Because of the large role that
policy plays in agencies’ decisions regarding when and where
to use and purchase NPM, stronger policies and support from
federal and state governments (Mortlock 1998) will be needed
to help increase supplies and lower cost of local genotype plant
materials.
There is an apparent disconnect between market percep-
tions among buyers and producers. It is clear that for a mar-
ket to be developed, an integrated collaborative strategy is
needed among producers, land managers, government agen-
cies, organizations, and researchers at both local and regional
scales. Collaborative efforts should focus on developing a
guiding framework to address these primary issues (Williams
& Price 2002): (1) increasing communication among stake-
holders; (2) increasing genetic research for the development
of appropriate seed zones; (3) increasing information transfer
regarding reliable methods for producing NPM; (4) ﬁnding
the most effective methods to improve market stability; and
(5) securing a stable funding mechanism for market initiation
and continued research and development. Obtaining appro-
priate long-term funding may be the most critical factor to
overcome to initiate a regional market.
Two main investment structures could be used for mar-
ket initiation within the region, a purely government funded
approach, or a collaborative effort between government agen-
cies and private entities. The GB Project is strictly government
funded and demand is primarily driven by multiple govern-
ment agency needs. The GB Project uses its funding to conduct
extensive research on key native plant species. The produc-
tion information obtained together with a small quantity of
seed stock is then provided to growers along with a buy-
back option as a market incentive. Only a minimal amount
of seed is bought back, leaving the rest of the supply to
become available for sale on the open market. The cost esti-
mate needed to initiate a market under this scenario is between
$4.6 and 6 million over a 5-year period (GBRI 2001; Pellant
2006). The UP Project exempliﬁes government and private
funding. Demand is driven by both private and public land
NPM needs, with a focus on providing a local-source of seed
for agency use. Major funding is secured through govern-
ment agencies, and additional outside funding is obtained to
provide ﬁnancial support and buy-back options to local grow-
ers. An estimated $2.4 million of government funding over
a 5-year period would be needed under this scenario (UP
Project 2007).
An entirely privately funded market initiation approach is
most likely infeasible due to the substantial initial investment
needed. Based on survey results, the southern Colorado Plateau
market is primarily driven by government needs. This suggests
that all, or at least half, of the funding should come from
government agencies and primarily those responsible for
burned area rehabilitation seeding activities.
Burned area rehabilitation plays a central role in the demand
for NPM in the southern Colorado Plateau. A determination of
how much seed is needed to meet post-ﬁre seeding demands
will be important to accurately assess the feasibility of market
initiation. We produced a theoretical example to determine an
estimated annual budget for post-burn seeding efforts in the
region. Between 1990 and 2005, the USFS typically seeded
ca. 5,700 ha/year (Wolfson & Sieg in press). Based upon our
survey results of area seeded, we assume that the BLM seeds
about the same area as the USFS, and that all other agencies
combined seed about half this area. Cumulatively, we estimate
that approximately 14,250 ha are seeded annually in Arizona
and New Mexico as part of burned rehabilitation efforts.
This would require an annual investment of $373,000 from
government agencies, and roughly 183 ha of production area
from seed companies (Table 3). Assuming a 20% ﬂuctuation
between mild and severe ﬁre seasons, between 11,400 and
17,000 ha could require seeding in Arizona and New Mexico
annually. This would require between $297,000 and $444,000
annually from government agencies, and between 146 and 218
production hectares from seed companies.
We based estimates on the average yield and matu-
rity of production ﬁelds for the top eight grass species in
demand (from survey results) in weighted-ranked order (vary-
ing weight given to species based on ranking order) and the
burned hectares seeded per year (Wolfson & Sieg in press)
while assuming the average percent seed viability/species

(85–97%, Damon Winter, Granite Seed, personal communica-
tion), roughly a 50% discount to federal agencies that purchase
native seed in bulk or through a competitive bidding process
(Curtis et al. 2005), and an average wildﬁre seeding rate of 600
pure live seeds per square meter (PLS/m2, Hunter et al. 2006).
The species used in this scenario are not a recommended list of
species but act as a single example for determining the ﬁnan-
cial investment needed based on an NPM market driven by
ﬁre rehabilitation efforts. For rehabilitation efforts to be suc-
cessful, using materials that are genetically diverse should be
a priority. Furthermore, this hypothetical example varies sub-
stantially from ﬁgures estimated from the GB and UP Project.
Because of this, a thorough economic analysis will be needed
to determine actual market expenditures.
Concerns over the effects increased disturbance will have
on native plant communities (Huenneke 1991) underscores
the importance of using both locally adapted and genetically
diverse plant materials to maintain the genetic integrity of
ecosystems. Therefore, the development of any NPM mar-
ket should not be viewed as a ﬁnancial burden, but rather
an ecological investment necessary for the future stability
and adaptability of ecosystems’ native plant communities.
Although this paper is regionally focused, it builds on informa-
tion gained from similar studies worldwide (Mortlock 1999;
Burton & Burton 2002; Williams & Price 2002), and provides
additional insight into issues and attitudes of those involved in
an NPM industry. There is reason to believe that restoration
practitioners as well as land managers will utilize our study to
expand upon the ﬁndings we have presented here, in order to
overcome challenges that may directly affect the development
and continuation of the NPM industry worldwide.
Implications for Practice
• Policy strongly favors the use of NPM for rehabilitation,
but low supply and inconsistent demand in the south-
ern Colorado Plateau have created an inefﬁcient circle
resulting in minimal NPM availability and use.
• Development of NPM is hindered by a lack of ade-
quate resources for buyers to consistently purchase the
quantities necessary to make supplying these materials
proﬁtable and available.
• Several models for native plant propagation exist in
surrounding regions: public, public–private, and pri-
vate enterprises. Seeding needs and cost projections in
the southern Colorado Plateau suggest that a viable
native plant production enterprise could support regional
demand at an annual investment of around $373,000
(United States).
