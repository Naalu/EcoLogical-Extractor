We investigated general effects of ecological restoration treatments on soil function in frequent-fire forests of the western
United States using a systematic review methodology. We searched numerous publication databases for original research
papers and used well-defined criteria developed a priori to select papers for review. We used meta-analysis and qualitative
summaries to compare reported responses of macronutrients, nitrogen cycling, and soil respiration among tree thinning (thin),
prescribed fire (burn), and thinning plus prescribed fire treatments (composite). Results of meta-analysis showed that mean
differences in macronutrients were consistently higher in composite treatments (standardized using controls) when compared
to thin-only and burn-only treatments. Mean responses related to nitrogen cycling showed similar patterns, with significant
increases detected in composite treatments for all nitrogen cycling variables (mineralization, ammonification, and nitrification)
and insignificant responses for the majority of the burn-only and thin-only treatments. Mean difference in response for soil
respiration following composite treatments showed increases as compared to the controls, and no significant differences were
detected in response to burn- and thin-only treatments. While soil function, nutrient cycling, and soil respiration differed
among treatments, the most significant effects were observed for nitrogen and carbon responses, net mineralization and
nitrification, ammonium availability, and soil respiration rate, which experienced the greatest increase following treatments
that were both thinned and burned.

Implications for Practice
• This study substantiates that systematic reviews are pow-
erful and efficient tools for providing reproducible sum-
maries of evidence relevant to restoration treatments and
exhibit great potential to guide policy decisions and con-
sideration of management alternatives.
• The most significant responses to restoration treat-
ments were positive and observed for total nitrogen-
and carbon-related variables, ammonium availability, net
mineralization and nitrification, and soil respiration rate.
• The most significant responses to restoration treatments
resulted from composite treatments that included both tree
thinning and prescribed fire.
• Manipulation of forest structure and composition, partic-
ularly through thinning and/or prescribed fire, may affect
soil processes and function and consideration should be
given to the complex nature of interactions among veg-
etation, soil microbiota, and physicochemical processes
when planning restoration treatments.
Introduction
Many frequent-fire ecosystems around the globe are actively
managed for fuel reduction to minimize fire severity, resilience
to disturbances, and to reestablishing natural ranges of
variability for structure, pattern, and ecological processes
(e.g. Burrows 2008; Moya et al. 2011; Franklin & Johnson
2012). However, the reintroduction of fire and the use of
prescribed burning, alone or following thinning, remains some-
what contentious among scientists and within the broader
community (Clarke 2008; Morrison et al. 1996; Reinhardt
et al. 2008; North et al. 2015). Globally, tree mortality as a
result of sustained drought, uncharacteristic wildfires, and
biotic agents appears to be increasing, driven in part by climate
change (van Mantgem et al. 2009; Allen et al. 2010; Weed et al.
2013; Dennison et al. 2014). In some ecosystems, such as the
western frequent-fire forests of the United States (including
forests dominated by ponderosa pine, Pinus ponderosa, and

Soil functional responses to ecological restoration
Jeffrey pine, Pinus jeffreyi), anthropogenic disruption of natural
disturbance regimes has led to large increases in tree and
woody plant density, reductions in understory plant community
abundance and species richness, and increases in forest floor O
horizon (Covington & Moore 1994; Kaye et al. 1999; Laughlin
et al. 2006). Currently, overly dense forests show symptoms of
ecological degradation in terms of lack of resilience to natural
disturbance and loss of habitat quality and natural levels of
heterogeneity (Waltz et al. 2014).
Although reference information on soil processes is lacking,
substantial alteration of ecosystem function has likely accompa-
nied structural and compositional changes stemming from fire
exclusion (Hart et al. 2005; Grady & Hart 2006). For example,
a strong body of research indicates that increases in seques-
tration of nutrients in needle accumulations on the forest floor
have resulted in reduced nitrogen transformation and carbon
cycling rates (Kaye & Hart 1998; Selmants et al. 2008). Lack
of frequent surface fire and associated reduction in abundance
of N-fixing plant species may have negatively affected soil C
and N fluxes and concentrations in upper horizons (Johnson &
Curtis 2001). Increases in forest cover and shading, increases
in litter depths, decreases in soil temperature due to shading,
and decreased moisture availability due to increased tree densi-
ties have also likely negatively impacted microbial community
activity and soil respiration (Ma et al. 2004; Concilio et al. 2005;
Ryu et al. 2009).
Ecological restoration treatments in these forests assist the
recovery of ecosystem function through removal of smaller,
younger trees, management of fuel loads, and reintroduction of
low-intensity surface fire (Covington et al. 1997; Allen et al.
2002; Fulé et al. 2012). In practice, the success of a restora-
tion project is often based on the establishment of a target plant
community rather than on the establishment of a vital, dynamic,
and living community of organisms belowground, or the func-
tions of these soil communities, primarily because ecologists
tend to focus on soils as a medium for plant growth (Callaham
et al. 2008). The impact to the physical, chemical, and biological
properties of the soil following ecological restoration treatments
is of fundamental importance and interest.
Soil processes in natural systems are complex, and our under-
standing of these processes in relation to ecological restoration
practices is still in relatively early stages. Manipulation of forest
density and application of prescribed fire may affect soil func-
tion in a number of ways, and responses reflect complex interac-
tions among vegetation, soil microbiota, and physicochemical
processes. For example, tree thinning activities that decrease
light interception by forest canopies, and increase soil tempera-
ture and moisture, may lead to increased microbial activity, res-
piration, and nutrient cycling (Hart et al. 2006; Selmants et al.
2008). However, whole-tree removal may result in net losses of
nutrients and carbon from sites (Johnson & Curtis 2001) while
nutrient cycling may remain unaffected where thinning and log-
ging residues are not subsequently burned or removed (DeLuca
& Zouhar 2000). While treatments that include prescribed fire
have common outcomes such as a net nutrient influx, enrichment
of P, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and an often temporary increase in pH,
treatment effects on soil nutrients and biotic responses are often
variable (sometimes including no net change) and depend upon
attributes examined, time frame, intensity of fire, and frequency
of burning (DeBano et al. 1998; Hart et al. 2005; DeLuca & Sala
2006). Thus, prediction of soil functional responses to ecologi-
cal restoration treatments is problematic and to date no system-
atic analysis of general patterns or drivers of variation in patterns
in this area has been undertaken.
Systematic reviews use an evidence-based framework to
review the effectiveness of various interventions, including
manipulations at an ecosystem level (Pullin & Stewart 2006).
Systematic reviews are powerful and efficient for assisting with
knowledge transfer and have an aim of providing reproducible
summaries of evidence to guide policy decisions and consider-
ation of management alternatives (Roberts et al. 2006; Bilotta
et al. 2014). They differ from traditional narrative reviews in a
number of ways, from question formulation all the way through
to dissemination of the results. For some reviews, prepublished
protocols are developed. In addition, members of the team
attempt to locate all relevant published and unpublished stud-
ies in order to lessen publication bias, and the type of stud-
ies to be included are defined prior to the systematic literature
search. Reviewers attempt to assess study quality and base con-
clusions from those papers on sound methodology (Petticrew
2001; Bilotta et al. 2014). Systematic reviews are not a sub-
stitute for quality primary research, but they serve a valuable
purpose of identifying where primary research may be lack-
ing (Petticrew 2001). Although systematic reviews have been
produced in the medical field for decades, many environmen-
tal researchers, practitioners, and policymakers are just now
becoming familiar with the steps involved in developing such
reviews (Petticrew 2001; Bilotta et al. 2014).
Furthermore, it is important to realize that systematic reviews
differ from traditional narrative reviews in numerous ways. Nar-
rative reviews tend to be largely qualitative, do not adhere to
a strict systematic search of the literature, and often concen-
trate on a subsample of studies chosen based on convenience
or author selection. Thus narrative reviews, while informative,
often include selection bias. Additionally, narrative reviews can
be confusing, particularly if comparable studies have differ-
ing results. Systematic reviews, as the name implies, should be
conducted according to a detailed and comprehensive plan and
search strategy, with the goal of reducing bias by identifying,
appraising, and synthesizing all relevant studies on a particular
topic. Often, systematic reviews include a meta-analysis com-
ponent which uses statistical techniques to synthesize the data
from several studies into a single, directly comparable, standard-
ized estimate, or summary of effect sizes (Petticrew & Roberts
2006).
In this study, we reviewed published literature to determine
whether ecological restoration treatments in frequent-fire forests
of the western United States generally resulted in positive,
negative, or neutral effects on soil function. We utilized a
systematic review methodology, and due to the availability
of data, we chose to focus on response data for three basic
indicators: macronutrient stocks, macronutrient cycling, and
soil respiration.

Methods
We conducted our review following the steps suggested by
Pullin and Stewart (2006): (1) formulate questions, (2) develop a
review protocol, (3) search data sources, (4) select relevant data,
(5) assess the quality of methodology (evidence), (6) extract
data, and (7) synthesize (analyze) data. We drafted questions,
which were then refined using informal discussions with outside
experts in natural resource management. We developed a review
protocol that described criteria for data searching, inclusion, and
quality of evidence (Table 1).
We systematically searched CAB ABSTRACTS (which
includes Forest Science Database), Web of Science, Biosis, and
GREENfile for original research papers using the review pro-
tocol, search terms, and inclusion criteria provided in Table 1.
Searches were conducted on both the common and scientific
names of the primary tree species, ponderosa and/or Jeffrey
pine, and had to include the terms “soil” and “forest.” Types of
literature were limited to primary research and included only
refereed journal articles and peer-reviewed scientific reports.
We evaluated each study to insure that the results presented were
based on unique data and assessed them against our inclusion
criteria (Table 1), with only studies considered relevant being
included in a database for review and analyses. All studies were
individually reviewed and data were extracted using Engauge
Digitizer 5.1 (http://digitizer.sourceforge.net) and summarized
in a spreadsheet using categories describing the subjects (forest
type, geographic region), treatments (burn only, thin only, thin
and burn), and outcomes (nitrogen, phosphorus, nitrate, soil
respiration, microbiota, etc.) (Table 1).
Quantitative data on soil function and ecological restora-
tion responses were compared across forest types and treat-
ments (e.g. mechanical thinning, prescribed fire; see Table 1
for a full list of treatments considered) using meta-analysis
techniques and qualitative summaries. Meta-analysis techniques
(Gurevitch et al. 1992) and the metaphor package (Viechtbauer
2010) were implemented in R 3.2.1 (R Core Team 2015).
Meta-analyses commonly use standardized mean differences or
“effect sizes” (e.g. Cohen’s d; Cohen 1969), which are calcu-
lated based on sample size and variance, assuming that studies
with large sample sizes and smaller variances are more reli-
able (Hedges & Olkin 1985). For each response with two or
more observations, we calculated a standardized mean effect
size with 95% confidence intervals and corrected for negative
bias, yielding interval estimates of Hedges’ g (Hedges 1981).
Mean effect sizes were considered to be significantly differ-
ent from 0 when the corresponding confidence interval did not

include 0. A standardized mean difference of 0, positive, or
negative indicated no change between treatment and control,
an increase in the response variable compared to the control,
or a decrease in the response variable, respectively. For each
outcome, meta-analytic fixed-effects models were fit without
covariates and using inverse-variance weighting to obtain sum-
mary estimates or an overall estimated mean difference (Thomp-
son & Sharp 1999) in effect size.
To examine the robustness of our study against publication
bias (i.e. the “file drawer problem” or the failure to publish null
results), we computed “fail-safe” numbers (Rosenthal 1979;
Gates 2002) for effect size (g) estimates. A fail-safe number
estimates the number of additional null-result studies needed
to produce statistically insignificant results, or the higher the
number the more confident we are in detected effects. The
reliance of this technique on variance estimates limited fail-safe
number estimation to 35 of the 43 studies only.
In cases where a measure of variability (e.g. standard devi-
ation) between treatment means was not reported and each
response contained two or more observations, we calculated a
variation of a response ratio (Hedges et al. 1999), relativized to
the control mean, as our measure of effect size. We defined this
standardized response as:

Miller et al. 2010; Fulé et al. 2012), as they are specifically
designed to measure relative differences. For each outcome
or response, the mean standardized response and standard
deviation were calculated. In cases where standardized mean
differences or standardized response could not be calculated
given the information reported, qualitative descriptions of
responses were summarized.
Results
Our initial database search returned 942 candidate papers.
After abstract and title review, we retained 110 papers to eval-
uate for inclusion based on the criteria presented in Table 1.
Forty-nine met inclusion criteria but three of these were
excluded from review (n = 46) because reported outcomes were
strictly expressed in terms of surface fuels (e.g. litter weight)
or soil macrobiota (e.g. density of mites). Studies were located
throughout the western United States and spanned a range of
frequent-fire forest types, with northern Arizona (42%), Cal-
ifornia’s Sierra Nevada Mountains (21%), and Oregon (14%)
being the most strongly represented (Fig. 1). Least represented
(making up approximately 19% of the data) and in decreasing
order, were studies from Montana, Nevada, New Mexico,
Idaho, and Colorado (with the latter two states only including
one study from each). Thirty-six studies (75%) were published
in the year 2000 or later. Just over half (55%) of the studies
were from ponderosa pine forest types, with the remaining
studies being conducted in mixed conifer forests dominated
by either ponderosa (30%) or Jeffrey (15%) pine. Study sites
ranged from 1,150 (Gundale et al. 2005) to 2,590 m (Concilio
et al. 2005) in elevation.
Six variables related to macronutrients and three related to
nitrogen cycling and soil respiration had sufficient data (two
or more observations) for meta-analysis. While five studies
reported responses related to microbiota (namely mycorrhizal
symbionts), no two studies reported common outcomes and
therefore none were included in meta-analysis. Macronutri-
ent variables included those related to carbon (C), total nitro-
gen (Ntotal), available nitrogen (Navail), nitrate (NO3
−), ammo-
nium (NH4
+), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K+); while
nitrogen cycling variables included measures of net mineral-
ization (conversion of organic N to mineral forms; hereafter
“mineralization”), ammonification (conversion of organic N to
ammonium, hereafter “ammonification”), and nitrification (con-
version of ammonium to nitrate). Figures 2A and 2B show
standardized mean differences in total and available nitrogen
responses for thin, burn, and composite restoration treatments.
For the studies reporting burn-only treatments for Ntotal (n = 6)
and Navail (n = 3), the mean difference was largely evenly dis-
tributed among possible outcomes (e.g. Ntotal exhibited two
with increases, two with decreases, and two with no signifi-
cant effect) resulting in an overall estimated mean difference not
significantly different from 0 for both Ntotal and Navail (Fig. 2;
−0.52 to 0.36 and −0.46 to 2.18, respectively). Similar to the
burn-only results, overall estimated mean difference for Navail
following thin-only treatments was not significantly different
from 0 (−0.18 to 1.57) and was slightly negative (−1.19 to
−0.19) for Ntotal. All studies reporting effects of composite
treatments on Ntotal and Navail showed positive mean increases
with eight of ten being significantly different from 0. Overall
estimated mean differences for Ntotal and Navail were 3.73 and
2.91, with 95% confidence interval estimates of 3.0–4.47 and
1.97–3.85, respectively.
Figure 3 demonstrates 95% confidence intervals of overall
estimated mean difference summarized for all macronutrients
(including Ntotal and Navail). Mean difference in macronutrients
showed a consistent pattern of significant increases compared to
controls in composite treatments, while burn and thin treatments
alone were lower in difference as compared to the untreated
controls. One exception in this pattern was mean difference
in NH4
+ (Fig. 3D), where thin-only treatments resulted in a
4.52–9.66 increase. Burn treatments significantly decreased
C and NH4
+, and had no detectable effect on the remaining
macronutrients. Thin treatments significantly decreased P and
Ntotal, increased NH4
+ and K+, and had no significant effect on
remaining macronutrients.
Estimated mean difference for variables related to nitro-
gen cycling showed a similar pattern to those observed for
macronutrients. Specifically, results (Fig. 4A–C) suggest sig-
nificant increases compared to controls in composite treatments
for all nitrogen cycling variables (mineralization, ammonifica-
tion, and nitrification), and insignificant responses for all burn-
and thin-only treatments, except for increased mineralization
observed for thin treatments (Fig. 4A). While mean difference

in response for soil respiration ranged from 0.72 to 1.45, and
averaged 1.09 as compared to untreated controls, no significant
difference from controls was detected for burn- and thin-only
treatments (Fig. 4D).
Given the number of studies available for meta-analysis,
fail-safe numbers were relatively low for all response variables
when examining burn- and thin-only treatments (Figs. 3 & 4).
In contrast, fail-safe numbers for composite treatments were
relatively high for all response variables, and ranged from 21
for potassium (Fig. 3G) to 221 for Ntotal (Fig. 3b). However,
ammonification had a composite treatment fail-safe number of
3 (Fig. 4B).
Standardized macronutrient responses, carbon and nitro-
gen cycling-related responses, and soil respiration for three
restoration treatments had inconclusive results (Table 2).
With the exception of a significant increase in carbon-related
responses (SR = 0.93, SD = 0.07) and an insignificant decrease
in nitrification-related responses (SR = −0.87, SD = 1.17), all
other responses to burn-only treatments exhibited significant
decreases. Conversely, all responses to thin-only and composite
treatments were not significantly different from 0, with the
exception of a decrease in carbon-related responses following
composite treatments (SR = −0.14, SD = 0.15) and an increase
in ammonium-related responses following thin-only treatments
(SR = 0.23, SD = 1.09).
Discussion
Fisher and Binkley (2000) refer to soils as the “hidden half”
of forests; a half which may be of equal importance to that
aboveground, but which is more difficult to observe and there-
fore less frequently studied. Abundant research suggests that
the removal of fire from frequent-fire forest types in the west-
ern United States results in various types of deviation from
reference conditions observable aboveground, including: (1)
increased fuel loads that lead to an infrequent stand-replacing

fire regime (Kalies & Yocom Kent 2016); (2) reduced biodi-
versity and loss of herbaceous plants (Moore et al. 2006); and
(3) decreased productivity in the form of tree and stand growth
due to overcrowding (Kolb et al. 2007). Effects resulting from
long-term absence of fire may also be evident belowground
due to indirect effects of high tree biomass and concomitant
litter deposition and accumulation. Higher tree densities may
induce lower water availability (Kaye et al. 1999) due to con-
sumption and canopy interception, possibly slowing microbial
activity and decomposition (Aerts 1997). Litter accumulation
may further alter nutrient cycles because tree litter, particularly
that of conifers, tends to be of low quality (i.e. high lignin:N
and C:N), suppressing decomposition rates (Aerts 1997) and
favoring nitrogen immobilization over mineralization (Lewis
& Kaye 2012). Both enhanced canopy and litter cover can be
expected to cool the soil during the growing season, which may
also suppress microbial activity, and therefore decomposition,
due to a strong positive dependence on temperature (Davidson
& Janssens 2006). Our systematic review sought to determine
if the results from ecological restoration studies designed to
restore aboveground structure, composition, and function could
provide evidence of soil functional outcomes.
Restoration Treatments Effect on Soil Function
The response of physical, chemical, and biological soil prop-
erties to forest restoration treatments is fundamentally impor-
tant because soils are the sites where were most decomposition
occurs and are thus directly linked to the nutrient cycling pro-
cess. Decomposition, along with primary production, is one of
the two major life-generating processes on Earth (Wall et al.
2005), and mineral nutrient pools may constrain production
(Wieder et al. 2015). As ecological restoration seeks to assist the
recovery of normal ecosystem function (SER 2004), achieving
normal decomposition and nutrient cycling rates are integral

Standardized mean difference of 0, positive, or negative indicated no change between treatment and control, increases in the response variable compared to

to the practice, though often not explicitly addressed. Our
meta-analysis of macronutrients, nutrient cycling, and soil res-
piration responses to forest restoration treatments across the
western United States indicated that ecological restoration treat-
ments implemented aboveground can effectively alter soil func-
tion belowground, but that various techniques are differentially
effective.
The impacts of fire on soils depend strongly upon the heat
generated, which is in turn well-predicted by the amount of
fuel consumed (DeBano et al. 1998). In our analysis, burning
alone either significantly reduced or had little short-term effect
(≤5 years) on most macronutrients, nutrient cycling, and soil
respiration. It is very likely that nutrients were lost in the O
horizon (Covington & Sackett 1986), but such an effect did
not translate to mineral horizons or undifferentiated surface
soils. These trends are likely the result of multiple processes.
Carbon on or near the soil surface is lost due to combustion,
but ash and other residues are also a C input. This may explain
some apparently conflicting results suggesting burning alone
may either increase or decrease soil C. Nitrogen is susceptible
to loss through oxidation, volatilization, or convection in ash
(Fisher & Binkley 2000). Organic P may also volatilize, but at
higher temperatures. In contrast, metal cations such as K+, Ca2+,
and Mg2+ neither volatilize nor oxidize; rather they accumulate
in ash fall (Fisher & Binkley 2000). Although a burned stand
experiences a net loss of nutrients, ash fall represents a nutrient
input into soil pools from aboveground pools or from O horizon
to mineral soil horizons, at least initially. The concentration of
K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ ions in the soil can increase or be unaffected
by fires, whereas nitrogen and sulfur often decrease (Hough
1981). Additionally, NH4
+ is a direct product of the combustion
of organic matter, while NO3
−is created from NH4
+ sometime
after fire as a result of nitrification (Covington & Sackett 1992).
If not promptly taken up by plants or microbes (both of which
are likely reduced by the fire), available nutrients including
PO4
−, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, NH4
+, and NO3
−can quickly decrease,

either by leaching (e.g. during snowmelt events), erosion (e.g.
during summer monsoonal storms), or sorption reactions that
render nutrients less available (Mroz et al. 1980; Kaye et al.
1999; Johnson & Curtis 2001).
Thinning is likely to affect soils in fundamentally different
ways. Rather than directly impacting nutrient pools, removal
of trees allows more solar energy to reach the soil surface, and
may favor greater soil moisture due to decreased evapotranspi-
ration and canopy interception of precipitation (Sun et al. 2015).
Because this alteration of the soil environment affects microbial
activity, thinning activities may result in increased soil func-
tion, respiration, and nutrient cycling (Hart et al. 2006; Selmants
et al. 2008). Recent studies indicate that a positive response of
nutrient concentrations or soil respiration to forest thinning is
not universal. For example, Klemmedson (1992) reported lit-
tle or no loss in N, C, and S and significant increases in P and
K following thinning in ponderosa pine forest of northern Ari-
zona, while Tang et al. (2005) report that thinning decreased soil
respiration as a result of decreased root density after thinning
in a ponderosa pine plantation in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.
However, soil function may remain unaffected in stands where
tree removal slash is left in place and not burned (DeLuca &
Zouhar 2000). Our results suggest that it is difficult to detect
an overall effect of thinning on soil nutrient pools, cycling or
respiration, likely due to such variability among study sites. A
notable exception was that thinning alone appeared to have a
positive effect on nitrogen cycling, especially the NH4
+ pool.
Composite treatments that included tree thinning and pre-
scribed fire generally induced showed greater positive soil
responses compared to burning or thinning alone, a finding
similar to that reported for fuels reduction treatments by Kalies
and Yocom Kent (2016). This was true for all of the measured
processes, and several nutrient pools. We believe that this is
either because less fuel was consumed in the cases where debris
was removed before burning, or because less of the soil sur-
face was exposed to high temperatures in the cases where pile
burns were implemented. Lower burn temperatures should lead
to fewer nutrient losses by volatilization, oxidation, or con-
vection (Fisher & Binkley 2000). Concentrating the impact of
burning, and therefore omitting burn impacts over much of the
soil surface, is likely to retain more of the plant cover, and soil
biota biomass, thus reducing leaching losses. While burning
alone has primarily negative effects on soil nutrient pools and
cycling, and thinning has some positive effects, the composite
treatment illustrates an interactive effect on frequent-fire forest
ecosystems. Like treatments employing burning alone, losses of
nutrients from O-horizons almost surely occurred in compos-
ite treatments compared to thinning-only treatments. However,
the presence of fire is an explicit part of the desired outcome of
restoration of these ecosystems, and fire alleviates the need for
costly recurrent thinning and removal of biomass. We suggest
that, of the three ecological restoration approaches, compos-
ite treatments most closely mimic the evolutionary environment
of these ecosystems (Moore et al. 1999), and therefore is most
likely to produce favorable responses both aboveground and
belowground.
While our systematic review suggests that composite treat-
ments may exhibit an additive effect on macronutrient stocks,
macronutrient cycling, and soil respiration, limited understand-
ing exists for equivalence among contrasting treatments (e.g.
burning alone vs. thinning and burning) in terms of soil and
ecosystem function worldwide. Simply speaking, the effects of
8
Restoration Ecology

Soil functional responses to ecological restoration
prescribed burning alone on soil function are better understood
compared to those resulting from burning following tree thin-
ning or harvesting. For example, Wang et al. (2012) reported
significant decreases in soil organic C and soil respiration, with
increases in soil total N (observed relative to the control) in a
meta-analysis of 76 papers related to wildfire, prescribed burn-
ing, and soil macronutrients from around the globe. Prober et al.
(2005) observed similar declines in soil ammonium and few
changes in nitrate following repeated prescribed fires, conclud-
ing that soil nitrate fluctuated greatly following burn-only treat-
ments in restored grassy woodlands in temperate agricultural
regions of Australia. Banning et al. (2007) found that thinning
affected soil N cycling up to at least 2 years post-treatment, by
increasing the potential for nitrification, particularly when com-
bined with prescription burning for rehabilitated post-mining
forests in Western Australia. Furthermore, our results align well
with numerous studies reporting inconclusive or net losses in
soil macronutrients following single and multiple prescribed
burns in fire-prone grassy woodlands of Australia (Prober et al.
2005; Burrows et al. 2010), Allepo pine (Pinus halepensis)
shrublands of Spain (Outeiro et al. 2008), and following tree
thinning and prescribed burning in other fire adapted ecosystems
of North America (Knoepp et al. 2004; Boerner & Brinkman
2004; Trammell et al. 2004; Grady & Hart 2006; Ganzlin et al.
2016).
Systematic Review Challenges and Data Gaps
The results of our systematic review are representative of
a methodical search of published research concerning soils
responses to restoration treatments in frequent fire ecosys-
tems of the western United States. Paralleling our findings,
similar reviews have noted geographic irregularities in restora-
tion science. For example, just under 80% of the studies
used by Martinson and Omi (2013) were from the western
United States (initial search was not limited to the United
States) of which 50% were studies including data from
only California, Arizona, Oregon, New Mexico, and Col-
orado. Likewise, Kalies and Yocom Kent’s (2016) study
was dominated by results from California, Arizona, Oregon,
and Washington. These studies, with the addition of our
work, suggest a possible under-representation of research
results in other frequent-fire ecosystems of the western
United States (those not dominated by ponderosa pine or
Jeffrey pine), such as those in Idaho, Montana, Colorado, and
Nevada.
Furthermore, systematic reviews offer many advantages over
other research synthesis techniques often used in ecology,
forestry, and restoration ecology. The results may be more accu-
rately evaluated, investigated, and updated. These are some of
the reasons for its popularity in medicine and other fields. One
of the ways in which bias is reduced in other fields is that sys-
tematic reviews may be registered before being conducted, with
strict protocols detailed in advance and followed during the
review process (e.g. Higgins & Green 2009). There have been
suggestions to adopt this practice in the field of conservation
biology (e.g., Stewart 2010) and while it has slowly become
a more prominent method, the fields of ecology, forestry and
restoration ecology have yet to adopt them.
While fire and thinning effects on soils have been summarized
in review or meta-analysis publications (e.g. see Neary et al.
1999; Johnson & Curtis 2001; Carter & Foster 2004; Certini
2005; Nave et al. 2011), we present the first known applica-
tion of systematic review methodology to quantitatively assess
restoration treatment effectiveness. Nevertheless, our efforts to
identify ubiquitous macronutrient, nutrient cycling, and soil res-
piration response patterns were impeded by numerous obstacles.
The primary problems included: (1) inconsistent quality of pub-
lished data and results; (2) lack of rigorous study designs; and
(3) a dearth of replicated studies where “restoration” was an
explicit focus. These limitations indicate a clear need for more
statistically rigorous studies (i.e. highly replicated, short- and
long-term experimental designs with control treatments) and
improved data reporting. Failure to sample or report on control
treatments as well as collect and/or report quantitative macronu-
trient, soil respiration, and microbiota responses resulted in ren-
dering numerous studies unusable for meta-analysis.
Although we were able to conduct analyses relevant to
macronutrient pools, and N and C cycling, our understanding is
still only partial. For example, we lack sufficient information on
other N cycling processes such as N-fixation and denitrification.
We were also unable to provide any new general insights regard-
ing the soil biota, despite using several search terms intended to
capture information about them. The soil biota may change in
predictable ways in response to restoration treatments, and these
community shifts could have contributed to observed changes
in soil function. The major barrier that we encountered was the
small number of studies presenting data describing the biota,
and wide variation in the data reported among the studies. This is
unsurprising, considering that there are many different attributes
of the biotic community that could be measured, and many
studies simply have different goals. Nonetheless, we can sug-
gest some characteristics of the soil community and their func-
tionality that may respond to ecological restoration and would
be of broad interest and utility: (1) the ratio of fungi to bac-
teria generally declines as organic substrate quality increases
(Blagodatskaya & Anderson 1998) and (2) the ratio of arbus-
cular to ectomycorrhizal fungi would be expected to increase in
response to any ecological restoration technique that bolstered
herbaceous vegetation. Such a shift in the foundational sym-
biotic fungi is likely to ripple throughout the soil community,
affecting ecosystem function (Antoninka et al. 2008; Cavagnaro
et al. 2007). Increasingly economical next generation molecu-
lar approaches such as HiSeq2000 and MiSeq Illumina platform
sequencing (Caporaso et al. 2012), and bioinformatics pipelines
such as QIIME (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology)
(Caporaso et al. 2010), are expanding the possibilities of exam-
ining the structure and diversity of soil microbial communities
using standardized approaches.
Conclusion
The overall results of our systematic review of functional
responses to restoration treatments in frequent-fire forests of

Soil functional responses to ecological restoration
the western United States indicate that composite treatments
combining small-diameter tree thinning and prescribed fire have
an interactive effect and, for most variables measured, produce
greater positive soil responses than burning or thinning treat-
ments alone. When planning ecological restoration projects, in
addition to the more well-known impacts to the aboveground
vegetation from thinning and burning, the chemical, biologi-
cal, and physical impacts to soils should be considered of equal
importance.
