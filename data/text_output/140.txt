Abstract. Mycorrhizae are important mediators of plant competition, but little is known 
about the role of mycorrhizae in the intense competitive effects that exotic plants can have 
on native species. In the greenhouse, we tested the effect o f  arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) 
fungi on interspecific competition between Cerztaur-ea maculosu and Fest~ccu idahoensis, 
on intraspecific competition between individuals of both species, and the growth of C. 
rnac~closawith either inorganic or organic phosphorus. Mycorrhizae had no direct effect 
on either species, but mycorrhizae increased C. maculosa's negative effect on F. iduhoe~zsis. 
When competing with C. rnac-ulosa, nonmycorrhizal F. idahoensis were 171% larger than 
they were when mycorrhizae were present. In a second experiment, C. maculosa grown 
with larger F. idahoe~zsiswere 66% larger, in the presence of AM fungi, than when AM 
fungi were absent. Centaurea maculosu biomass was not affected by AM fungi, in either 
phosphorus treatment, in the absence of F. idahoensis. Root: shoot ratios differed between 
phosphorus treatments, but this difference seemed to be a result of slower growth in the 
organic phosphorus treatment. Our results were unusual in that the direct effects of my- 
corrhizae on both species were weak, but the indirect effect of AM fungi on the interactions 
between C. muc~tlosa and F. idahoerzsis was strong. Our results suggest that AM fungi 
strongly enhance the ability of C. ~naculosato invade native grasslands of western North 
America.

Well documented indirect interactions include those be-

19781, 
starfish, molluscs and algae (Paine 1966),parasitic and 
autotrophic plants (Pennings and Callaway 1996), 
plants and soil microflora, (van der Putten et al, 1993. 
Bever 1994) and plants and mycorrhizal fungi (Grime 
et al. 1987, Hetrick et al. 1989, Hartnctt et al. 1993, 
vary with nutrient availability (Allen and Allen 1990, 
Hetrick et al. 1990, 1992, Johnson et al. 1997). For 
example, phosphorus availability can significantly af- 
fect the 
plant's relationship with AM fungi. In 
natural soils, moat phosphorus is found in bound, or- 
ganic forms that are not directly available for plant use. 
When inorganic forms of phosphorus are available for 
direct uptake, or when phosphorus is abundant, fungal 
s~mbiOntsmay be suppressed (Koide and Li l990, KO-
ide and Schreiner 1992, DeLucia et 
1997) Or the

Because AM fungi can influence 
bier-
archies, they can have strong impacts on plant corn-
mu nit^ structure. For 
AM fungi affect the

replacement of nonmycorrhizal plants by 
mycorrhizal species (Allen and Allen 1984,1988,Allen 
et al. 1988, Francis and Read 1994). AM fungi have 
also been shown to contribute to species coexistence 
by favoring inferior competitors (Grime et al. 1987, 
Hetrick et al. 1989, Hartnett et al. 1993, Zobel and 
Moora 1995, Moora and Zobel 1996). However, they 
have the potential to contribute to competitive exclu- 
sion and to decrease species diversity i f  AM fungi favor 
a superior competitor (Allen and Allen 1990). 
Exotic plant invasions often provide clear examples 
of competitive exclusion. While AM fungi may pro- 
mote diversity among naturally co-occurring plant spe-

cies, the role of mycorrhizae in mediating interactions 
betwcen invaders and native species is not well un- 
derstood (Goodwin 1992). Centaurea rnuculosu Lam. 
(Asteraceae) and others in its genus are among the most 
economically destructive range weeds in western North 
America (Watson and Renney 1974, Griffith and Lucey 
1991). Despite extensive efforts to eradicate them, Cerz-
taurea species are spreading at prodigious rates (Mul- 
ler-Scharer and Schroeder 1993). Field populations of 
C. nzuculosa in western Montana are heavily colonized 
by AM fungi, and colonization levels are higher than 
some species of native bunchgrasses that it frequently 
displaces (Marler 1997). In a series of greenhouse ex- 
periments, we investigated the direct effects of AM 
fungi on (1) C. rnacitlosa in different phosphorus treat- 
ments, and (2) competitive interactions between C. 
rnaculosa and the native bunchgrass, Festitca idahoerx- 
sis Elmer. 
All experiments were conducted in a naturally lit 
greenhouse that was supplemented with high-pressure 
sodium lighting. Photosynthetically active radiation 
(PAR) was in the range 700-1200 
mmol pho-
t o n ~ . m - ~ . s
-' during the 16 h photoperiod. Temperatures 
ranged from 18-30Â°C throughout the experiments. 
Experiment I 
To test the effects of AM fungi on competition be- 
tween plants of the same age, we grew the native 
bunchgrass F. idahoensis and C. rnaculosu in intra- 
specific and interspecific combinations, with and with- 
out AM fungi. Six plants were started at the same time 
from seed in each of 60 pots. Pots measuring 21.25 cm 
in diameter and 27.5 cm deep were filled with sterile 
silica sand averaging 0.60-0.85 mm in diameter. After 
three weeks, seedlings were selected for uniformity in 
size and were thinned to two per pot so that neighbors 
were within 10 cm of each other. A 2 cm thick layer 
of whole field soil (including root fragments) was add- 
ed as inoculum 6 cm below the surface of the sand. 
Field soil was collected from beneath many species of 
native plants and C. rnacitlosu on Mount Sentinel in 
Missoula, Montana, USA, and was mixed before use. 
Mycorrhizal colonization levels at this site were mea- 
sured in 1995, using the methods of McGonigle et al. 
(1990), and were 44% for C. maculosa and 45% for F. 
idahoensis (Marler 1997). Nonmycorrhizal treatments 
received autoclaved field soil and 50 ml of a microbial 
wash. This solution was prepared by filtering a soil 
slurry through a 25-p,m filter paper, which is fine 
enough to remove mycorrhizal fungal propagules, 
whilc allowing other soil microorganisms, including 
potential pathogenic bacteria and fungi, to pass through 
the filter (Johnson 1993). 
Plants were watered to saturation once per week and 
received 250 ml of a one-eighth strength Hoagland's 
solution weekly, modified by the addition of phospho- 
rus as inositol hexaphosphate. This form is not directly 
available to plants for uptake, and requires alteration 
in the soil by mycorrhizal fungi, soil microbes, or root 
exudates (DeLucia et al. 1997). The final concentration 
of phosphorus was 1.93 p,g/ml, which is comparable 
to levels used by other researchers to investigate effects 
of mycorrhizal colonization in otherwise sterile sub- 
strates (Koide and Li 1990). After three months, we 
measured the total biomass of roots and shoots for both 
species and evaluated treatment effects on mycorrhizal 
colonization of roots. 
Biomass of F. idahoerzsis was natural-log-trans-
formed for normality, prior to analysis with a two-way 
ANOVA for effects of neighbor and AM fungal treat- 
ments. Data for root : shoot ratios and C, maculosa bio-
mass was normally distributed and did not require 
transformation. To determine whether significant dif- 
ferences in root : shoot ratios were due to functional 
shifts in allocation patterns, or to differences in growth 
among treatments, we examined the root : shoot ratios 
allometrically by plotting the natural log of root bio- 
mass against the natural log of shoot biomass for both 
species (see Colcrnan et al. 1994). Then, to determine 
if treatments within an experiment were described by 
the same linear function, we used an analysis of co- 
variance (ANCOVA) to test for differences in the 
slopes (interaction between treatment and the natural 
log of shoot weight) and y-intercepts (natural log of 
root weight). 
The results from the first experiment indicated that 
small F. idahoerzsis had minimal effects on C. rnaculosu 
of the same age. To further examine these interactions 
we conducted a second experiment, in which C. macu-
losa were grown with large, established F. idahoensis 
neighbors. We grew a single C. maculosa from seed in 
each of 30 pots containing an 8-wk-old F. idahoensis. 
In this experiment, final mean biomass of F. idahoer~is 
was 0.525 g, compared to 0.145 g in the previous cx- 
periment. The pots and growth medium were the same 
as described for the Experiment 1. The grasses were 
provided field soil inoculum during the establishment 
period; thus, plants of both treatments had the potential 
to form mycorrhizae before the experiment began. Fun- 
gicide is the only way to establish a nonmycorrhizal 
treatment with previously infected plants. When C. rna- 
culosa seeds were planted, AM fungi were reduced in 
one half of the pots by adding 300 mg of Bonomyl 
(Bonide, Bonide Products Incorporated, Yorkville, 
New York, USA), applied in 100 ml of water per pot 
(50 mg/kg growth medium). Benomyl, a similar sys- 
temic fungicide, applied at this rate has been shown to 
effectively reduce mycorrhizal colonization in green- 
house soils with negligible direct effects on plants (Het- 
rick et al. 1989). Since systemic fungicides are not 
specific and kill saprophytic as well as mutualistic fun- 
gi, their use in mycorrhizal studies must be interpreted

with care. We watered and fertilized the plants as in 
the first experiment, with phosphorus added as inositol 
hexaphosphate to a final phosphorus concentration of 
1.93 p,g/ml, and reapplied Bonomyl every 3 wk. After 
7 wk, we compared mean total biomass and root : shoot 
ratio of both species in mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhi- 
zal trcatments with t tests for significance at P < 0.05, 
and we checked for mycorrhizal colonization. Data for 
both species were normally distributed and did not re- 
quire transformation. We did not statistically compare 
the rcsults of Experiment 1 to those of Experiments 2 
and 3, because they were conducted at different times. 
Experiment 3 
We tested the direct effects AM fungi on C. maculosa 
using two different forms of phosphorus. Individual C. 
rrzac~tlosawere grown from seed in pots of the same 
size and containing the same medium as in Experiments 
1 and 2. Plants were watered weekly with 250 ml of 
one-eighth strength Hoagland's solution, which was 
modified by addition of phosphorus (1.93 p,g/ml) as 
either the organic form, inositol hexaphosphate (less 
available for direct plant uptake), or an inorganic form, 
potassium dihydrogen phosphate, which is directly 
available to the plant. The purpose of the inorganic 
phosphorus treatment was to create conditions in which 
plants would be less likely to benefit from mycorrhizae. 
In each phosphorus treatment, there were mycorrhizal 
and nonmycorrhizal treatments. Fungi were reduced in 
nonmycorrhizal pots with repeated Bonomyl applica- 
tions as described for Experiment 2. After 7 wk, we 
measured total biomass and root: shoot ratios for each 
plant, and we compared the means with two-way 
ANOVAs for the effects of phosphorus and AM fungi 
treatments. Data were normally distributed and did not 
require transformation. Root: shoot ratios for each spe- 
cies were examined allometrically as described for Ex- 
periment 1. 
Experiment 1 
nization = 0%). The competitive effect of C. mac~tlosa 
was much greater in the presence of AM fungi, as in- 
dicated by a significant interaction term between com- 
petitor species and AM treatments (Table 1). Whcn 
grown with C. maculosa, average F. idahoelzsis bio-
mass was 171% greater when AM fungi were not pres- 
ent (Fig. 1). AM fungi had no effect on F. idahoensis 
biomass in the absence of C. muculosu (Fig. 1, Table 
1). However, there was a significant interaction effcct 
between AM fungi and competitor species on the root : 
shoot ratio of F. idahoensis. When grown with C. mac-
ulosa, F. idahoensis root : shoot ratio significantly in- 
creased when AM fungi were present (Fig. 1, Table 2). 
The natural log of root and shoot weights were cor-
related (r2 = 0.77) and neither the slope ( P  = 0.79) 
nor intercept (P = 0.70) differed significantly between 
AM treatments, indicating that the differences were due

ence of AM fungi depended on which competitor was 
present (Fig. 2, Table 3). Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 
tended to decrease C. rnaculosa biomass in the presence 
of a conspecific, but tended to enhance C. rnaculosa 
biomass in the presence of F. idahoerzsis. AM fungi 
decreased the root: shoot ratio of C. rnaculosa (Fig. 2, 
Table 4). When these ratios were examined allometric- 
ally, the natural log of root weight and shoot weight 
were correlated (r2 = 0.59), and there was no difference 
between the slopes for root-shoot relationships of the 
AM treatments (P = 0.63). However, the intercepts 
differed significantly (P = 0.01), suggesting that the 
differences in root: shoot ratios may have been due to 
allometric shifts in response to the AM fungal treat- 
ment. 
Experiment 2 
Bonomyl application significantly reduced mycor- 
rhizal colonization (after McGonigle 1990) of roots 
from an average of 32.9 i 6.3% (1 SE) to 9.8 i 3.4% 
for F. idahoensis (one-way ANOVA, df = 1,21; P = 
0.004) and from 34.6 ? 5.9% to 4.0 ? 1.4% for C. 
rnacztlosa in this experiment (one-way ANOVA, df = 
1,21; P < 0.001). Festuca idahoensis biomass was not 
affected by the presence of AM fungi in this experiment 
(t test, df = 14, P < 0.818; Fig. 3); however, the bio- 
mass of C. rnaculosa that were grown with large, es- 
tablished F. idahoerzsis was 66% larger when AM fungi 
were present (t test, df = 14, P = 0.025; Fig. 3). AM 
fungi did not alter root: shoot ratios of C. rnacztlosa (t 
test, P = 0.084) or large F. idahoensis (t test, df = 14, 
P = 0.741).

(1 SE; t test, df = 7, P = 0.019), but AM fungal treat- 
ments did not significantly affect final C. maculosa 
biomass in either phosphorus treatment (Table 5). In 
contrast to Experiment 1, root : shoot ratio was not af- 
fected by AM fungi, but increased in the organic phos- 
phorus treatment (Table 6, Fig. 4). The natural log of 
root weights and shoot weights were correlated (r2 =

dicating that the difference~ were due to difference~ in 
growth between treatments, rather than allocation dif- 
ferences. 
AM fungi had no direct effect on the biomass of 
either C, macztlosa or F. idahoensis, but substantially 
increased the competitive effect of C. maculosa on F. 
idalzoensis. Furthermore, AM fungi had a much stron- 
ger impact on C. maculosa's growth, when paired with 
large F. idahoensis than with small F. idahoensis. 
When both species were started from seed, the presence 
of AM fungi during interspecific competition had a 
substantial negative impact on F. iclahoensis, while C.

nificant interaction effect). In the Experiment 2, large 
F, idahoensis showed no response to AM fungi, where- 
as C. macztlosa biomass increased by more than half, 
in comparison to the nonmycorrhizal treatment. Our 
results fit theoretical predictions (Allen and Allen 
1990) that AM fungi provide a greater benefit to plants 
with taproots than to those with fibrous root systems, 
but in this case, the benefits were indirect. 
The fact that C. maculosa responded to mycorrhizae 
only in the presence of F. idahoensis, and much more 
when the F, idahoensis neighbor was large, suggests 
that mycorrhizal fungi may have mediated a parasitic 
interaction. In addition to altering competitive hierar- 
chies by directly enhancing nutrient uptake, mycor- 
rhizae can translocate nutrients or photosynthate be- 
tween plants (Chiarello et al. 1982, Francis and Read 
1984, Walter et al. 1996, Watkins et al. 1996h, Simard 
et al. 1997). This may be how C. maculosa gains ad- 
vantage in our system. If so, it is not surprising that 
the large F. idahoensis did not respond negatively in 
Experiment 2, since it is a slow growing perennial, and 
the study was relatively short in duration. However, 
since photosynthate transfer, in general, is poorly un- 
derstood (Watkins et al. 1996a), and since we did not 
directly measure translocation of resources, we cannot 
conclude that this mechanism is responsible for our

results. Improved competition for other rcsources, such 
as nitrogen, may be equally or more important. 
It is surprising that neither species was directly af- 
fected by AM fungi, since they are infected under nat- 
ural conditions. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi often im- 
prove phosphorus acquisition, but AM fungi did not 
improve the growth of C. maculosa, even when only 
organic phosphorus was added. However, the lack of 
response may have been due to our expcrirnental con- 
ditions (P may not have been limiting in either treat- 
ment), or P acquisition may not be an important role 
of mycorrhizae on C. maculosa. Mycorrhizae engage 
in dynamic interactions that can range from antagonism 
to true mutualism (Bronstein 1994, Thompson 1994, 
Johnson et al. 1997), and the function of AM fungi 
associated with these species may fall near the center 
of this continuum. Furthermore, AM fungi may provide 
other benefits such as protection for host roots from 
saprophytic fungi and other soil pathogens (Newsham 
et al. 1995). 
We observed statistically significant differences in 
root : shoot ratios for F. idalzoensis and C. maculosa in 
Experiment 1, as well as for C. maculosa in Experiment 
3. The shift in root: shoot ratio in Experiment 3 sug-
gests a response to reduced phosphorus availability. 
However, biomass partitioning in plants is often size 
dependent (Coleman et al. 1994), and data must be 
examined allometrically to determine if differences in 
root: shoot ratios are the result of decreased growth 
and dclayed development, or of reallocation in response 
to limiting resources (Bazzaz et al. 1989, Coleman et 
al. 1994). Our allometric analysis indicates that the 
differences in root: shoot ratios between AM fungal 
treatments for C. inaculosa in Experiment 1 may have 
been due to reallocation, but the remaining differences 
in allocation patterns are probably a reflection of de- 
creased growth in certain treatments. 
Our results demonstrate strong indirect effects, but 
we could not detect direct effects of AM fungi on C. 
maculosa and F. idahoensis. This is unusual, as strong 
Indirect interactions are generally mediated by strong 
direct effects. This generality, which appears to be 
widespread within and between trophic levels (Paine 
1974, Lubchenco 1978, Hay et al. 1983, Cottam et al. 
1986, Brown and Heske 1990, Huntly 1991, Miller 
1994) was not supported by our study. 
Many studies have found that AM fungi promote 
specics diversity (Grime et al. 1987, Hetrick et al. 1989, 
1990, Hartnett et al. 1993, Zobel and Moora 1995, 
Moora and Zobel 1996). 111this study, AM fungi fa- 
vored the invader C. maculosa, which was the dominant 
competitor, even in the absence of AM fungi. Hoffman 
and Mitchell (1986) and Halvorson and Koske (1987) 
found invasive plants to be colonized with AM fungi, 
but few if any studies have experimentally addressed 
whether AM fungi contribute to competitive domi- 
nance. Field experiments are necessary to solidify our 
understanding of mycorrhizae as a significant factor in 
this system, but our evidence indicates that in situ soil 
fungi increase thc ability of an exotic invader to sup- 
press a native competitor.
