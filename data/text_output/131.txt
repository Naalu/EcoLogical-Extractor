Abstract.
The El Ni˜no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a climate-forcing mechanism that
has been shown to affect precipitation and the occurrence of wildﬁres in many parts of the
world. In the southern United States and northern Mexico, warm events (El Ni˜no) are
associated with moist winter conditions and fewer ﬁres, while cool events (La Ni˜na) tend to
favor dry winters and more ﬁres. We tested this relationship in a region of northeastern
Mexico by characterizing the historical ﬁre regime and climatic inﬂuences. Fire regimes were
reconstructed from ﬁre-scar samples collected from 100 trees in three high-elevation sites on
Pe˜na Nevada in southern Nuevo Leo´ n. The sites were ;25 ha each, and the site centers were
;1 km apart. The earliest recorded ﬁre occurred in 1521 and the time period we used for
analysis was 1645–1929. The sites were characterized by frequent surface ﬁres before the 1920s.
In the three sites, mean ﬁre intervals ranged from 8.6 to 9.6 years (all ﬁres) and 11.9 to 18.6
years (ﬁres that scarred 25% of recording trees). The per-tree mean ﬁre return interval was 17
years, and all three sites burned in the same year seven times between 1774 and 1929. After
1929, ﬁres were nearly eliminated in all sites, likely due to human causes. We found a temporal
change in the association between ENSO events and ﬁres; before the 1830s La Ni˜na events
were signiﬁcantly associated with ﬁre years, while after the 1830s this association was not
signiﬁcant. In 1998, when the most severe El Ni˜no event of the past century occurred, the three
sites experienced severe, stand-replacing ﬁres that killed many trees that had survived multiple
surface ﬁres in the past. Prior to the 1830s, ﬁres tended to occur during dry La Ni˜na years, but
since then both La Ni˜na and El Ni˜no have been associated with dry years in this region,
especially during the last three decades. This result suggests that ENSO effects have changed
over time in this location and that phases of ENSO are not consistent indicators of
precipitation, ﬁre occurrence, or ﬁre behavior in this area of northeastern Mexico.

INTRODUCTION
In western North America, the El Ni˜no Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) is a climate-forcing mechanism that
has been shown to affect precipitation and the occur-
rence of ﬁres. Linkages between ENSO and the
occurrence of forest ﬁres have been recognized at scales
ranging from local and regional (Swetnam 1990,
Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003, Brown and Wu 2005,
Fule´ et al. 2005, Skinner et al. 2008) to subcontinental
and intercontinental (Kitzberger et al. 2001, 2007). La
Ni˜na winters (ENSO cool phase) in northwestern
Mexico are typically hot and dry, as they are in the
American Southwest, and ﬁres are more likely to burn
during these years (Swetnam and Betancourt 1990,
Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003, Fule´
et al. 2005,
Kitzberger et al. 2007, Skinner et al. 2008). In southern
Mexico, however, El Ni˜no winters (ENSO warm phase)
are dry and ﬁre-prone (Maga˜na et al. 2003, Roma´ n-
Cuesta et al. 2004, Seager et al. 2009).
The extreme El Ni˜no event of 1998 was associated
with a widespread drought and severe forest ﬁres in
Mexico. It was an unprecedented year for Mexico in
terms of number of ﬁres, area and biomass burned,
smoke released, cost of suppression, and ﬁreﬁghter lives
lost (Rodrı´guez-Trejo and Pyne 1999, Duncan et al.
2003). Most of the ﬁres were located in the southern part
of the country (Rodrı´guez-Trejo and Pyne 1999), where

El Ni˜no typically induces drought. However, severe ﬁres
also burned farther north in Mexico, in the Sierra Madre
Oriental.
The Sierra Madre Oriental, in eastern Mexico, is
located on or near the dipole where ENSO events
change effects; it is situated between areas where La
Ni˜na is associated with dry conditions (northwestern
Mexico), and areas where El Ni˜no is associated with dry
conditions (southern Mexico) (Caso et al. 2007, Seager
et al. 2009). Because of its geographical location on or
near the ENSO dipole, it is unknown whether warm or
cool phases of the oscillation are more likely to be
associated with ﬁre occurrence in this area. Severe ﬁres
burned in the Sierra Madre Oriental during the 1998 El
Ni˜no event, but the 1998 El Ni˜no was extremely strong
and therefore may have had atypical effects on ﬁres in
this region.
The types of ﬁre behavior that occur in high-elevation
forests of the Sierra Madre Oriental are also unknown.
Severe ﬁres in 1998 devastated many stands of trees, but
this level of severity may have been an anomaly
compared to the historical ﬁre regime. Pinus hartwegii
(Lindl.), a dominant tree species at high elevation in the
Sierra Madre Oriental and elsewhere in Mexico and
Guatemala (Farjon and Styles 1997), has several
adaptations to ﬁre, including thick bark and the ability
to resprout after ﬁre (Rodrı´guez-Trejo and Fule´ 2003).
While thick bark is usually considered an adaptation to
surface ﬁre, sprouting sometimes occurs in trees adapted
to intense crown ﬁre (Keeley and Zedler 1998).
Although there have been several studies of P.
hartwegii ﬁre ecology, this is the ﬁrst ﬁre history study
in a P. hartwegii forest and the ﬁrst long-term ﬁre
history study in the Sierra Madre Oriental. Gonza´ lez et
al. (2007) reconstructed ﬁre history of a pine–oak forest
(P. teocote, P. pseudostrobus) in the northern Sierra
Madre Oriental, but their tree-ring record reached back
only to 1868. Fire history studies in northwestern
Mexico, in the Sierra Madre Occidental (Fule´
and
Covington 1994, Heyerdahl and Alvarado 2003), and in
the Sierra San Pedro Ma´ rtir (Stephens et al. 2003)
indicate that ﬁres occurred frequently in the past and
that ﬁre regimes continued uninterrupted well into the
20th century. The Sierra Madre Oriental contains high
biodiversity, including 59 endemic plant species that
inhabit ,6 km2 each (McDonald 1993). At least 35% of
timberline plant species in the range are endemic to the
Sierra Madre Oriental (McDonald 1990). Pe˜na Nevada,
the location of our study, has 10 plant species endemic
to the peak alone (McDonald 1993). We selected Pe˜na
Nevada to quantify long-term ﬁre regimes because of its
critical location in a transition zone of ENSO effects as
well as the high conservation value of this rare
ecosystem.
The objectives of this study were (1) to characterize
the historical ﬁre regime in the P. hartwegii forests of
Pe˜na Nevada, including ﬁre frequency, type, size,
season, and synchrony, and (2) to determine whether
ﬁre years were associated with ENSO. Speciﬁc questions
included: What were the characteristics of the ﬁre
regime? Was the ﬁre regime interrupted in the 20th
century? What are the effects of ENSO on ﬁres in this
region of Mexico? Were the ﬁres in the 1998 El Ni˜no an
anomaly?
STUDY AREA
Pe˜na Nevada, at 3540 m elevation, is located in the
Sierra Madre Oriental in the state of Nuevo Leo´ n,
Mexico (Fig. 1). We focused on Pe˜na Nevada (also
called El Picacho San Onofre) primarily for biogeo-
graphical reasons: it is the southernmost peak in the
high, consolidated part of the Sierra Madre Oriental
that runs from just south of Monterrey to southern
Nuevo Leo´ n and southwestern Tamaulipas, and it is
located
between
areas where ENSO
events have
opposite effects. We chose speciﬁc sites on the mountain
because of their history of relatively light anthropogenic
disturbance prior to the 1998 ﬁre, the presence of P.
hartwegii forests, which were least anthropogenically
disturbed at the highest elevations, and the presence of
old trees or old remnant wood. In addition, the sites
were spaced along a broad ridgeline, which would allow
them to capture evidence of ﬁres spreading up either side
of the mountain.
The study area is located at ;3200 m above sea level.
Climate data from lower-elevation weather stations to
the southeast and southwest of Pe˜na Nevada (Uvalles,
1565 m and San Antonio Pe˜na Nevada, 1680 m)
averaged annual precipitation of 335 mm, with peaks
in late spring and late summer (IMTA 2007). The
precipitation at sites .2800 m in the Sierra Madre
Oriental is estimated to be 450–500 mm annually (J.
Villanueva-Diaz, unpublished data), but the percentage
of precipitation that falls as snow is unknown. Average
yearly temperature at the two lower-elevation stations is
10.88C (IMTA 2007), but the average yearly tempera-
ture at our study sites is certainly lower. The majority of
lightning storms in the area occur in the spring (IMTA
2007). Exposed rock in the Sierra Madre Oriental is
limestone (Ferrusquı´a-Villafranca 1993).
The sites we sampled are dominated almost exclu-
sively by P. hartwegii. After the severe ﬁre in 1998, some
parts of Pe˜na Nevada experienced high tree mortality
and were later salvage logged. Because of this, much of
the area we sampled was essentially clearcut, with some
pockets of intact forest.
In 1984, Andrew McDonald witnessed and took a
photo of a recently burned area in a remote area on Pe˜na
Nevada, not near our sampling sites (A. McDonald,
personal communication). The photo shows that some of
the forest burned severely; only charred snags are left in
the burned area. It is likely that the severe ﬁre happened
in 1983; the needles on the trees at the edge of the burn
were orange but had not yet fallen by 1984. The year
1983 was dry at Pe˜na Nevada, which also lends credence
to the 1983 date.

ENSO EFFECTS ON FIRES CHANGED OVER TIME

METHODS
We collected ﬁre-scarred tree samples at Pe˜na Nevada
in 2007. We established three sites of ;25 ha each at San
Onofre (SO), El Diferencial (DI), and Mesa Acu˜na
(MA) (Fig. 1). The sites were spaced ;1 km apart and
had comparable elevation and vegetation. All had
moderate slopes, situated on top of a broad ridgeline.
We systematically searched each site and took ﬁre-
scarred samples that would provide good spatial
distribution throughout the site. We chose to sample
trees of any species with the largest numbers of well-
preserved ﬁre scars (Van Horne and Fule´ 2006), but we
also sampled live trees, which often had only one or two
scars, to ensure that the ﬁre history extended up to the
present. We used chain saws to remove partial cross
sections of ﬁre-scarred trees. Data recorded for each
sample were tree species and diameter, status (live,
stump, snag, or log), slope, aspect, and ﬁre scar height
and aspect. We georeferenced each sample to map the
spatial distribution of the samples.
In the laboratory, samples were sanded with increas-
ingly ﬁner grits of sandpaper until individual cells were
clearly visible under a microscope. We crossdated each
sample using a Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco
tree-ring chronology from nearby on Pe˜na Nevada
(Villanueva-Diaz et al. 2007). The crossdating of each
sample was conﬁrmed by a second dendrochronologist.
We measured the ring widths of each sample and
checked the crossdating with the COFECHA software
program (Holmes 1983).
We identiﬁed ﬁre scars to the year of origin by noting
the crossdated ring in which the ﬁre injury occurred
(Baisan and Swetnam 1990). When possible, ﬁre scars
were determined to be located in the early earlywood
(EE), middle earlywood (ME), late earlywood (LE),
latewood (L), or on the boundary between rings
(indicating a dormant [D] season ﬁre). We assigned
dormant season ﬁres to the subsequent calendar year
because most ﬁres in areas with similar precipitation
patterns burn prior to the summer rains. We grouped
ﬁres into spring (D þ EE) and summer (ME þ LE þ L)
categories for seasonal evaluation.
Fire history statistics were calculated for periods in
which there was an adequate tree-ring record. Each site
was determined to have an adequate tree-ring record
when at least 10% of total samples in that site were
scarred. The same criterion was used when calculating
statistics for the three sites combined. In the three sites
combined, the period with an adequate tree-ring record
was 1645–1929. Each site individually had an adequate
tree-ring record from 1641 to 1920 (SO), 1645–1929
(DI), and 1774–1928 (MA).
Fire history statistics were calculated with FHX2
version 3.2 software (Grissino-Mayer 2001). For each
site and for all three sites combined, we calculated the
composite mean ﬁre interval between all ﬁres and also
between more widespread ﬁres that scarred at least 25%

of recording trees. Recording trees are trees that have
been scarred by ﬁre once; after an initial wound, trees of
some species are more likely to scar in subsequent ﬁres
(Romme 1980) and therefore are ‘‘recording trees.’’ We
calculated Weibull median and modal ﬁre intervals, and
looked for temporal differences in mean ﬁre interval,
seasonality of ﬁres, and ﬁre relationship with precipita-
tion and ENSO between the ﬁrst portion of the period of
analysis (1645–1831) and the second portion (1832–
1929). We split the analysis at 1831/1832 not a priori but
because one of our results, a graph of ENSO extremes
and precipitation at Pe˜na Nevada, showed an unexpect-
ed change in relationship around that time. We also
examined the ﬁre history at Pe˜na Nevada for evidence of
a hiatus in ﬁre occurrence that would coincide with a
late 18th–early 19th centuries gap in ﬁre documented at
many sites in the southwestern United States and
northwestern Mexico (Swetnam 1990, Kitzberger et al.
2001, Stephens et al. 2003, Brown and Wu 2005, Skinner
et al. 2008).
To evaluate climate conditions related to ﬁre occur-
rence at our study sites, we used superposed epoch
analysis (SEA) in FHX2 version 3.2 (Baisan and
Swetnam 1990, Swetnam 1993, Grissino-Mayer 2001)
to compare independently derived indices of ENSO and
precipitation during ﬁre years, for ﬁve years prior to ﬁre
years, and for two years after ﬁre years. Reconstructions
used include a reconstruction of winter ENSO (NINO3,
December–February, 1408–1978; Cook 2000), and a
local precipitation reconstruction (Villanueva-Diaz et al.
2007). The time series of precipitation had no temporal
autocorrelation, but the NINO3 index did. To address
the temporal autocorrelation in the NINO3 index, we ﬁt
autoregressive integrated moving average models based
on lowest Akaike’s information criterion and signiﬁcant
but uncorrelated parameter estimates (Brown et al.
2008). We used the white noise residuals in our analyses.
To assess statistical signiﬁcance in the SEA analyses,
conﬁdence intervals (95%) were calculated using boot-
strapped distributions of climate data in 1000 trials. We
compared ENSO and precipitation indices with the
occurrence of all ﬁres regardless of size, as well as
widespread ﬁres that scarred at least 25% of recording
trees in all three sites. We completed these analyses for
the entire period with an adequate tree-ring record
(1645–1929) and also for the ﬁrst part of this period
alone (1645–1831) and the second part alone (1832–
1929).
We
plotted
extreme
ENSO
events
on
a
local
precipitation reconstruction based on P. menziesii
annual rings (Villanueva-Diaz et al. 2007). Extreme
winter Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) values were
identiﬁed between 1699 and 1971 by Stahle and Cleave-
land (1993), using tree-ring records from Mexico and the
United States. Stahle and Cleaveland used two methods
to reconstruct extreme SOI values, regression and
classiﬁcation, and considered the most accurate list of
extremes to be a list of years when both methods
obtained the same results for extreme winter SOI values.
This is the list we used. After 1971, we determined
extreme winter SOI values to be December–January–
February (DJF) average values (SOI data from NCAR’s
Climate Analysis Section Data Catalog (available on-
line)7 that were .1.5 standard deviations from the
average DJF values from 1935 to 2006. Using this
method, extreme winter SOI values after 1971 were in
1974 and 1976 (La Ni˜na events), and 1983, 1992, and
1998 (El Ni˜no events).
RESULTS
Fire history
We collected a total of 112 samples: 34 in SO, 48 in
DI, and 30 in MA. The majority of samples were taken
from stumps and all but one of the samples were from P.
hartwegii; the exception came from a single P. menziesii.
We were able to crossdate 100 of the samples (89%) and
we identiﬁed 408 scars in total. We were unable to date
12 samples (11%) because of rotten wood, rings that
were too tight, or an insufﬁcient number of rings to
permit reliable crossdating.
The earliest ﬁre scar identiﬁed in our three sites
occurred in 1521, and the last ﬁre scars were from 1998,
the year that much of the forest in our sites burned
severely. Until the late 1920s, the ﬁre regime at Pe˜na
Nevada showed relatively little variability across sites
and through time (Fig. 2). The mean ﬁre interval for all
ﬁres was within one year’s difference between sites (SO,
9.3 years; DI, 8.6 years; MA, 9.6 years; Table 1). The
mean ﬁre interval for more widespread ﬁres (those that
burned 25% of the trees) was longer, and varied from
11.9 years in MA to 18.6 years in SO (Table 1). The
Weibull distribution, which has been used in describing
ﬁre regimes because it is ﬂexible, able to ﬁt skewed data
sets, and provides a standard way to compare ﬁre
regimes across ecological gradients (Grissino-Mayer
1999), ﬁt our data well. Weibull median probability
interval values were similar to mean ﬁre interval values
(Table 1). The mean ﬁre interval for individual trees was
17 years. There were no statistically signiﬁcant temporal
differences in mean ﬁre interval or percentage of samples
scarred between 1645–1831 and 1832–1929.
Two of the three sites (SO and DI) have a continuous
record starting in the early 1500s and large numbers of
samples starting in the 1600s. Site MA is the only site
that does not have a continuous record that precedes the
early 1700s. Two samples were found in MA that span
the mid-1500s to the mid-1600s, but there is a gap in
sample coverage between the mid-1600s and the early
1700s. MA did have one pulse of regeneration in the
early 1700s; seven out of nine pith dates in that site were
from between 1726 and 1742. Sites SO and DI had 18
samples that contained pith; pith dates were scattered

from 1589 to 1892 with no pulse of regeneration evident
at any time in either site.
Between 1774 and 1929, out of 38 years with ﬁres,
seven years (18%) had ﬁres recorded at all three sites
(SO, DI, and MA): 1786, 1819, 1831, 1838, 1899, 1909,
and 1920. Twenty-two ﬁre dates (58%) were unique to
one site only and nine ﬁre dates (24%) were recorded at
two sites. Although the sites did not share many of the
same ﬁre years, all three sites recorded similar numbers
of ﬁres during the period 1774–1929 (21 ﬁres in SO, 23
ﬁres in DI, and 17 ﬁres in MA).
We were able to determine seasonality of 55% of the
ﬁre scars. Of those, 92% were found on the ring
boundary, meaning that the majority of ﬁres occurred
in the dormant season (Table 1). Another 5% were
found in early earlywood, and 3% were found in middle
earlywood. No scars were found in the late earlywood or
latewood.
A dramatic decline in ﬁre frequency occurred after the
1920s (Fig. 2). Site SO experienced one ﬁre between 1920
and 1998 (1955), DI had no ﬁres between 1929 and 1998,
and MA had one ﬁre between 1929 and 1995 (1951). Site
SO had a 43-year ﬁre-free interval, DI had a 69-year ﬁre-
free interval, and MA had a 44-year ﬁre-free interval.
The ﬁre-free periods in the 20th century were unprec-
edented in the previous 300þ years: previously, the
longest intervals without ﬁre in each of the sites were 19,
32, and 16 years, respectively.
Pe˜na Nevada showed no evidence of a hiatus in ﬁre
occurrence that would coincide with the gap in ﬁre in the
late 18th and early 19th centuries documented at many
sites in the southwestern United States and northwestern
Mexico. We did, however, observe a period of few ﬁres
from the 1680s to 1717, and another period of few ﬁres
from the 1750s to 1774, as reﬂected in reduced ﬁres per
decade (Fig. 2).
Fire–climate
ENSO events were related to ﬁre occurrence in the
early portion of our period of analysis, but the
relationship changed over time. Results from the SEA
analyses indicate that in the period 1645–1831 ﬁres were

sites) is shown with years below the chart. Software used was FHX2 version 3.2 (Grissino-Mayer 2001). Also shown is a running
(10-year) average of the number of ﬁres per decade (bottom panel).

likely to occur in La Ni˜na years (years when NINO3
values were signiﬁcantly below average; Fig. 3). This
relationship was signiﬁcant (P , 0.05) for ﬁres that
scarred 25% of recording trees. Between 1832 and
1929, however, there is no signiﬁcant relationship
between ENSO and years when ﬁres burned, regardless
of the size of the ﬁre. For ﬁres that scarred 25% of
recording trees before 1831, the 3–5 years before ﬁre
years had signiﬁcantly above-average NINO3 values.
After 1832, the year immediately prior to widespread
ﬁres (those that scarred 25% of recording trees) had
signiﬁcantly above-average NINO3 values.
The decoupling of La Ni˜na and dry, ﬁre-prone years
in the early 19th century was further explored with
additional analyses. First, SEA analyses associating
extreme ENSO events and precipitation show that
before 1830, extreme La Ni˜na events (Stahle and
Cleaveland 1993) were likely to be very dry (P ,
0.01), but approximately average after 1832 (Fig. 3).
Second, by overlaying SOI extremes on a graph of
reconstructed Pe˜na Nevada winter precipitation (Fig. 4),
it is evident that from 1700 to 1830, four of the ﬁve El
Ni˜no extremes corresponded with precipitation maxima
and six of the seven La Ni˜na extremes coincided with
precipitation minima (Fig. 4). Between the 1830s and the
1970s, the extremes were less distinguishable in the Pe˜na
Nevada precipitation record; El Ni˜no extremes still
tended to be wet but La Ni˜na extremes ranged from dry
to wet conditions. In the late 20th century, it appears the
patterns of precipitation during extreme ENSO events
have diverged even more dramatically. The El Ni˜no
events of 1983 and 1998 were extremely dry years at
Pe˜na Nevada; 1998 was the second-driest year at Pe˜na
Nevada since 1508 in a precipitation reconstruction
using P. menziesii annual rings (Villanueva-Diaz et al.
2007). Since 1508, only 1805, which was an extreme La
Ni˜na year, was drier.
Regardless of ENSO phases, ﬁres occurred more often
in dry years at Pe˜na Nevada throughout the period of
analysis (Fig. 3). Only the ‘‘all ﬁres’’ relationship
between ﬁre years and precipitation before 1831 did
not reach 95% signiﬁcance. The other categories of ﬁre
both before 1831 and after 1832 were signiﬁcantly
related to years of low precipitation. The seven years
when ﬁres occurred in all three sites were signiﬁcantly
dry, and there was also, on average, a signiﬁcantly wet
year two years prior to these seven ﬁre years (not
shown).
DISCUSSION
What were the characteristics of the ﬁre regime?
Before the 1920s, the ﬁre regime at Pe˜na Nevada was
characterized by relatively frequent surface ﬁres, as

Note: The Weibull distribution provides a standard way to compare ﬁre regimes across ecological gradients (Grissino-Mayer
1999). Number with season means the number of ﬁre scars for which an intra-ring position could be determined. DE ﬁres are those
that occur during the dormant period or when the tree is putting on its ﬁrst earlywood (early earlywood).

ENSO EFFECTS ON FIRES CHANGED OVER TIME

indicated by our reconstruction reaching back several
hundred years. Individual trees were scarred by ﬁre up
to 10 times each; on average, individual trees were
experiencing and surviving ﬁres more frequently than
every two decades throughout their lives (individual tree
mean ﬁre interval 17 years). This is a conservative
estimate, as not all ﬁres leave scars on recording trees,
and we excluded ﬁres with uncertain dates from all
statistical analyses. The historical ﬁre regime at Pe˜na
Nevada is similar to the historical low-severity surface
ﬁre regime found in the more northerly dry coniferous
forests of northwestern Mexico and the southwestern
United States (Fule´ and Covington 1999, Heyerdahl and
Alvarado 2003, Stephens et al. 2003, Fule´ et al. 2005).
This is true even though the dominant species at Pe˜na
Nevada (P. hartwegii) is different from any species
sampled in other ﬁre history studies, and these sites are
at a much higher elevation.
Unlike some high elevation sites in the western United
States (Kipfmueller and Baker 2000, Margolis et al.
2007), we did not ﬁnd evidence of stand-replacing ﬁres
from the 1500s through the early 1900s, although there
is a possibility that site MA experienced a stand-
replacing ﬁre in the early 1700s based on the lack of
sample coverage before 1725 and the pulse of regener-
ation between 1726 and 1742. In addition, although we
found old, ﬁre-scarred trees dating back centuries in our
other sites, meaning that no stand-replacing ﬁre at the
25-ha scale had occurred since at least ;1600, it is
possible that smaller patches within our sites experi-
enced high-severity ﬁre that we did not detect. We
conclude that the historical ﬁre regime was dominated
by low-severity surface ﬁres, with the possibility of
patchy stand-replacing disturbances in some sites.
A stand-replacing ﬁre did occur in 1998 in all three
sites after decades of ﬁre exclusion, and there is evidence
that a severe, stand-replacing ﬁre occurred in 1983 on a
different part of the mountain. There are two possible
explanations for the seemingly anomalous severity of
these ﬁres in the late 20th century. One is that decades of
ﬁre exclusion led to a buildup of fuels, which facilitated
the crown ﬁres in the extremely dry years of 1983 and
1998. The other possible scenario is that our three
ridgetop sites captured evidence of predominantly
surface ﬁres. We leave open the possibility that the
larger Pe˜na Nevada landscape historically experienced

some severe ﬁres as well as surface ﬁres and that the late
20th century severe ﬁres were not as unusual as the
evidence suggests.
More than half the ﬁres during the period of analysis
were small and burned in only one of the three sites
sampled. Surprisingly, since the three sites are within a
3-km section of the ridgetop, ﬁres were not generally
synchronous between the three sites. Only seven ﬁre
dates between 1774 and 1929 were recorded at all three
sites. These results suggest that ﬁres in our sites were
frequent but not usually very large. Frequent but small
and asynchronous ﬁres have also been found in western
Mexico, in the Sierra Madre Occidental (Fule´
and
Covington 1999), although in other areas of the Sierra
Madre Occidental ﬁres were historically more large and
synchronous (Fule´ et al. 2005).
An unusual feature of the Pe˜na Nevada ﬁre history is
the almost complete dominance of dormant-season ﬁres
(206 of 224 ﬁres; 92%); almost all of the ﬁres recorded
occurred before cambial growth began. Although little is
known about growth phenology in this region, the
dominance of scars on the ring boundary or in the early
earlywood suggests that the majority of scars were
formed in the spring or early summer. These seasonality
results, including the lack of scars in the latewood,
support the assumption that dormant-season ﬁres occur
in the spring rather than in the fall. We hypothesize that
the high percentage of dormant-season scars at Pe˜na
Nevada is due to the high elevation. Cambial growth of
trees likely begins relatively late in the year, while most
lightning strikes in this area occur during the spring
before the ﬁrst precipitation peak in May (IMTA 2007).
In sites studied in western Mexico, percentage of
dormant-season ﬁres ranged from 0.3% (Skinner et al.
2008) to 47% (Fule´
et al. 2005) to 56% (Fule´
and
Covington 1999) to 63% (Heyerdahl and Alvarado
2003).
This is the ﬁrst study to quantify ﬁre history from ﬁre
scars in a P. hartwegii forest. This species is capable of
basal resprouting, which has been interpreted in other
tree species as an adaptation to stand-replacing distur-
bance, including crown ﬁre (Rodrı´guez-Trejo and Fule´
2003). However, we did not see any P. hartwegii sprouts
at Pe˜na Nevada, and our data indicate that in our sites,
the P. hartwegii forest sustained a surface ﬁre regime for
the past several hundred years.
Was the ﬁre regime interrupted in the 20th century?
The near cessation of ﬁres after the 1920s is likely
related to the formation of Ejido La Encantada on Pe˜na
Nevada in 1937. Ejidos are communities that live on
rural lands that are held in common and managed with
some level of governmental control (Thoms and Betters
1998). In the Sierra Madre Occidental, a decrease in the
percentage of sites with ﬁre around 1930 coincided with
the granting of lands to ejidos (Heyerdahl and Alvarado
2003). Heyerdahl and Alvarado speculated that granting
land to ejidos may have changed the ﬁre regime through
the introduction or intensiﬁcation of cattle grazing, road
building, logging, and changing the traditional role of
ﬁre. These same factors likely changed the ﬁre regime at
Pe˜na Nevada when Ejido La Encantada was formed.
Other hypotheses are less likely; there is no evidence of a
climatic
change
in
this
area
in
the
early 1900s
(Villanueva-Diaz et al. 2007), and throughout Mexico
ﬁre regimes were disrupted during different decades (i.e.,
the 1930s and 1940s [Fule´ and Covington 1999] and the
1950s [Fule´ et al. 2005]) or not at all. This suggests that
climate is not responsible for the cessation of ﬁres after
the 1920s at Pe˜na Nevada. Fire suppression policy is
probably not the reason for the cessation of ﬁres either:
control efforts in this area have been limited in scope
(local crews and landowners, rather than engines and
helicopters).
We have no data on human population history or the
history of ﬁre use at Pe˜na Nevada, and we cannot
distinguish human ignitions from lightning ignitions
throughout the period of record. The many small ﬁres
on the peak indicate many local ignitions, meaning that
ﬁres did not always start in the centers of population in

ENSO EFFECTS ON FIRES CHANGED OVER TIME

the valleys below. Given the elevation of the mountain,
lightning strikes probably occur often. Lightning in this
area peaks before the early summer rains begin, which is
consistent with the fact that almost all ﬁres with
determinable season occurred in spring or early summer
before cambial growth began. However, humans may
also have ignited ﬁres in these high-elevation forests, and
it is most likely that both lightning and humans caused
ﬁres historically.
What are the effects of ENSO and other climate patterns
on ﬁres in this region of Mexico?
As expected, ﬁres tended to burn at Pe˜na Nevada
during dry years. This pattern did not change through-
out the period of record. For most categories of ﬁre, we
saw no evidence that ﬁres were related to high
precipitation in years preceding ﬁres, as has been found
in many sites in the southwestern United States (e.g.,
Grissino-Mayer et al. 2004). However, the seven years in
which ﬁres burned all three sites show evidence of
occurring two years after a wet year, which could
indicate that the most widespread ﬁres were inﬂuenced
by the buildup of ﬁne fuels during wet years.
The most striking characteristic of the relationship
between ENSO, dry years, and ﬁre at Pe˜na Nevada is the
shifting relationship between El Ni˜no/La Ni˜na, precip-
itation, and ﬁre over time, with one shift occurring
around 1830 and another occurring in the last few
decades (around 1970). Before the 1830s, La Ni˜na had a
signiﬁcant effect on the occurrence of ﬁre at Pe˜na
Nevada: negative NINO3 values were strongly associ-
ated with ﬁre years (Fig. 3). This is consistent with
studies in northwestern Mexico and the southwestern
United States (Swetnam and Betancourt 1998, Heyer-
dahl and Alvarado 2003, Kitzberger et al. 2007, Drury
and Veblen 2008). After 1830, the relationship between
ﬁre and La Ni˜na at Pe˜na Nevada was not signiﬁcant.
Fires continued to burn in dry years, but they were no
longer associated with La Ni˜na (Fig. 3). Since the 1970s,
extreme ENSO events have been more erratic; the
extreme El Ni˜no events of 1983 and 1998 were very
dry at Pe˜na Nevada but the 1992 extreme El Ni˜no was
very wet (Fig. 4).
While numerous studies have associated ENSO
patterns with ﬁre occurrence in the Americas, to our
knowledge this is the ﬁrst study to document a change in
the effects of ENSO on the occurrence of ﬁre over time.
The reason for the change is not clear. We hypothesize
that the changing nature of the ENSO–ﬁre relationship
could be due to (1) the location of this study site, (2)
climatic shifts associated with the late 18th–early 19th
century gap in ﬁre, or (3) possible effects from climate
change. Pe˜na Nevada is located in the transition zone, or
dipole, of ENSO effects: northwestern Mexico tends to
be dry during La Ni˜na events while southern Mexico
tends to be dry during El Ni˜no events (Maga˜na et al.
2003). Because this is the ﬁrst ﬁre–climate study in this
part of North America, we do not know if this result is
anomalous or typical. Tree-ring chronologies and
precipitation reconstructions from elsewhere in the
Sierra Madre Oriental show that 1998 was anomalously
dry in other places in northeastern Mexico. This is also
evident in maps of extreme El Ni˜no events created by
Maga˜na et al. (2003). The dryness in an El Ni˜no winter
normally extends up partway through Mexico, but in
1998 the drying extended much farther north, including
our study area. We will explore further whether
geographic location in relation to spatial teleconnections
is responsible for the shifting effects of ENSO on
precipitation and ﬁre as we analyze data from other ﬁre–
climate studies in this region, currently underway.
Although we saw no evidence of a hiatus in ﬁre at
Pe˜na Nevada coincident with the late 18th–early 19th
century gap in ﬁre, as has been recorded at many other
sites in North and South America, the ﬁrst shift in
ENSO effects at this site occurred around 1830, which is
approximately when changes in ﬁre regime, or in some
cases the end of the hiatus, happened in several other
areas. For example, Stephens et al. (2003) noted less
frequent and more synchronous ﬁres after ;1830 in the
Sierra San Pedro Ma´ rtir in northern Baja California.
Sakulich and Taylor (2007) also documented a shift
from frequent small burns to less frequent larger burns
after 1800 in their study area in western Texas. The
reasons and the precise dates for the shift in ﬁre regime,
or in some cases ‘‘the gap,’’ are still unresolved.
Hypotheses include decreased amplitude and/or fre-
quency of ENSO, a cool phase of the Atlantic multi-
decadal oscillation (AMO), a cool phase of the Paciﬁc
decadal oscillation (PDO), and lower variability in
climate in general (Donnegan et al. 2001, Kitzberger et
al. 2001, 2007, Heyerdahl et al. 2002, Grissino-Mayer et
al. 2004, Brown and Wu 2005, Sibold and Veblen 2006,
Brown et al. 2008, Skinner et al. 2008). It is possible that
at Pe˜na Nevada one or more of these hypotheses could
explain the change in ENSO effects in ;1830 and the
change after the 1970s as well.
The change in ENSO effects at Pe˜na Nevada in the
late 20th century (around 1970) is more dramatic than
the early 1800s change. After centuries of receiving
above-average precipitation during El Ni˜no events, Pe˜na
Nevada experienced the second-driest year in almost 500
years during the El Ni˜no event of 1998 (Villanueva-Diaz
et al. 2007). The year 1983, when another El Ni˜no event
occurred, was also dry at Pe˜na Nevada according to the
local tree-ring record. Some scientists attribute the
unprecedented amplitudes of the 1983 and 1998 El Ni˜no
events to anthropogenically induced global climate
changes, while others do not (Fedorov and Philander
2000). Climate change is likely to affect El Ni˜no by
altering the background climate, but of the several
projections that have been made about details of these
changes, it is currently impossible to know which, if any,
are correct (Fedorov and Philander 2000, Tudhope and
Collins 2003).

Were the ﬁres in the 1998 El Ni˜no an anomaly?
At our sites on Pe˜na Nevada, we have evidence of
both top-down and bottom-up control of ﬁres, including
the anomalously severe ﬁre of 1998. The severity of this
ﬁre was probably due in large part to top-down
inﬂuences of climate: low precipitation and high
temperatures. In 1998, Pe˜na Nevada received very little
precipitation. The year 1998 was also the warmest year
of the 20th century (McPhaden 1999), which may have
inﬂuenced the area burned globally that year, as well as
area burned in Mexico and the Sierra Madre Oriental.
Unusually severe wildﬁres like the one that burned Pe˜na
Nevada in 1998 will probably occur again if projections
of warming and drying are realized (Westerling et al.
2006, Seager et al. 2007, 2009).
Changes in the bottom-up inﬂuences of fuels and
forest structure also may have had an impact on the
large size and severity of the El Ni˜no ﬁre of 1998. The
forests in our sites, adapted to fairly frequent surface
ﬁre, had not experienced wildﬁres for more than 40 (and
in some cases almost 70) years before 1998. The resulting
buildup of fuels and changes in canopy structure over
time may have contributed to the severe impacts that
occurred when a ﬁre ﬁnally did burn during a dry year.
The low-intensity surface ﬁres that historically burned
in our sites were also likely inﬂuenced by both top-down
and bottom-up effects. Evidence for bottom-up control
is the dominance of small asynchronous ﬁres that
occurred at only one of the three sites from 1645 to
1929, suggesting that differences in fuels, ignitions, and
site characteristics were important at this small scale.
Top-down inﬂuence on the historical low-intensity
surface ﬁres is evidenced by the strong relationship of
ﬁre with dry years, throughout the period of record. In
addition, before the 1830s, ENSO also had a strong
relationship with ﬁre occurrence. Prior to the 1920s,
when ﬁre exclusion began, bottom-up controls like fuel
availability probably moderated top-down climatic
inﬂuences. However, the bottom-up control that fuel
exerted was eliminated when ﬁre exclusion began and
fuels became more homogeneous and probably more
dense. This may have allowed top-down extreme
climatic controls to dominate ﬁre behavior in the late
20th century.
The dominant trees at Pe˜na Nevada survived multiple
ﬁres over centuries, but an event of mass mortality
occurred in our study area in 1998, probably due to a
combination of fuel buildup and extreme dryness.
Considering possible changes in future climate and the
biological importance of the Sierra Madre Oriental,
including the high number of local endemics, this merits
concern and the development of new strategies for
conservation. In some parts of Mexico, excessive
human-originated ﬁre has contributed to deforestation
or forest structure changes in pine forests. Public
education campaigns have been implemented through-
out the country to reduce excessive burning (Rodrı´guez-
Trejo and Fule´ 2003). However, in the Sierra Madre
Occidental in northwestern Mexico, there are areas
where ﬁre frequency today is similar to historical ﬁre
frequency and areas where ﬁres, historically frequent,
have been absent or rare for decades (Rodrı´guez-Trejo
and Fule´ 2003). Based on our reconstruction of ﬁre
history at Pe˜na Nevada, ﬁres occurred much less
frequently after the 1920s than in the previous several
centuries. Fire suppression in areas with ﬁre regimes
historically characterized by frequent surface ﬁres is not
the best management tool, as it may contribute to forest
change, fuel buildup, and increased risk of catastrophic
crown ﬁres. It is useful to understand the historical ﬁre
regimes of these forests to design the best management
approaches for these areas. In addition, understanding
how ENSO and other climate factors inﬂuence precip-
itation and ﬁre is important; ENSO may no longer be a
reliable indicator of precipitation or ﬁre occurrence or
behavior in this part of Mexico. It will be valuable to
expand the network of ﬁre–climate sites to enhance our
understanding of ﬁre–climate relationships and to
further investigate whether ENSO effects on precipita-
tion and ﬁre are changing throughout the region or
whether it is a site-speciﬁc phenomenon.
