provided leadership and support to the Four Forest
Restoration Initiative (4FRI) for the past five years are
looking forward to the completion of an environmental
analysis that will allow the restoration of almost
600,000 acres and reinvigorate a wood-based
economic sector in northern Arizona.
 
Sometime in the upcoming weeks, the U.S. Forest
Service will announce a decision on the 4FRI
Environmental Impact Statement, and ERI scientists
are eager to get to work monitoring the restoration
progress. ERI is poised to conduct several projects
associated with the phase one 10-year contract,
including a paired watershed study in partnership with
the Salt River Project that will examine long-term
restoration treatment effects on downstream water
flows.
 
Additionally, ERI researcher Dr. Andrew Sánchez
Meador recently published an article in the Journal of
Forestry looking at diameter cap implications on 4FRI
treatment prescriptions. See the article below in
“Publications,” or click here.
 
Once a decision has been signed on the largest site-
specific environmental analysis in USFS history, then
the critical, long-overdue work of restoring our
forested landscapes can accelerate.

FACT SHEETS
Roccaforte, J.P. 2015. Forest Structure and Fuel
Dynamics Following Ponderosa Pine Treatments,
White Mountains, Arizona, USA. ERI Fact Sheets.
Ecological Restoration Institute, Northern Arizona
University. 2 p.
This fact sheet summarizes findings from a study
where researchers tested alternative approaches for
restoring degraded ponderosa pine forests. Of the
treatments tested, the full treatment (thin plus burn)
was the only one that rapidly shifted forest structure
and canopy fuels values to near or within the historical
reference conditions.

Researchers examined the ecological and social
implications of imposing a diameter cap at the Fort
Valley Ecosystem Restoration Project on U.S. Forest
Service lands near Flagstaff, Arizona. The
researchers found the concerns about thinning
treatments resulting in the loss of old growth were not
realized.

A team of researchers measured evapotranspiration
(ET) over four years in three ponderosa pine forests
near Flagstaff, Arizona. Measurements were taken
using the eddy covariance method in order to
compare the data with actual ET estimates from five
meteorological models to help better determine how
restoration projects that use tree thinning to reduce
the risk of wildfire affect ET.

history of a mixed conifer forest on the Mogollon Rim,
northern Arizona, USA. International Journal of
Wildland Fire, http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF14005
 
A team of forest ecologists reconstructed fire regime
characteristics of a mixed conifer forest on the Black
Mesa Ranger District of the Apache-Sitgreaves
National Forests in northern Arizona by analyzing
composite fire intervals, point fire intervals, natural fire
rotation, landscape characteristics, and forest age
structure. Researchers found that the historical fire
regime was one of high frequency, low-severity fires,
and that current conditions call for restoration of forest
structure and function.

Kurth and others examined the long-term dynamics of
net and gross nitrogen transformations after stand-
replacing wildfires. The results suggest that stand-
replacing wildfires trigger a shift in nitrogen cycling for
at least 30 years.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT – 2015 SUMMER
FIELD SEASON OUTLOOK
 
By John Paul Roccaforte, Sr. Research Specialist
 
ERI’s R&D team is eagerly anticipating another
productive field season and will begin collecting data
in mid-May. Staff and students are preparing gear and
working out logistics for various projects; two new
undergraduate students have been hired and six
seasonal employees are expected to come onboard.
Crews will continue work on the Flagstaff Watershed
Protection Project (FWPP), moving on from the Dry
Lake Hills field site (measured in 2014), to Mormon
Mountain, southeast of Flagstaff. ERI’s role in the
FWPP is to monitor changes in Mexican spotted owl
habitat that result from fuels reduction treatments.
Crews will also be collecting data for a new study that
aims to evaluate multi-scale ecological effects in past
wildfires that were managed to achieve resource
benefits. Sites may include the North Rim of the
Grand Canyon, the Mogollon Rim, and several others
in between.
Crews will also remeasure plots following last
summer’s San Juan Fire, which burned over parts of
the Mineral LEARN study site in east-central Arizona.
R&D staff also plan to work with Coconino National
Forest staff to layout restoration prescriptions for the
Mogollon Rim LEARN study.
Lastly, R&D staff will be collecting data for several
rapid assessment projects being led by ERI’s Agency
Outreach team on the Apache-Sitgreaves, Carson,
Tonto, and Coronado national forests.

AGENCY OUTREACH
By Bruce Greco, Director of Agency Outreach
The Agency Outreach Team is having a very
successful and productive start to this year. We are
focused on data collection and analysis on several
key U.S. Forest Service (USFS) projects in the
Southwestern Region. The team is participating in on-
going Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration
(CFLR) projects and providing science support to
restoration implementation efforts. A few highlights
include:
 
Escudillia East Restoration Project –
Springerville/Alpine Ranger District, Apache-
Sitgreaves NF: ERI is working with the forest to
provide a rapid assessment study and report on a
~64,000-acre restoration project. This project is in the
early stages of NEPA analysis with a decision
anticipated in 2016. A specific component is the
identification of historic pinyon-juniper woodland and
grassland areas.
 
Kaibab NF Restoration Assessment – The Williams
and Tusayan Ranger Districts, Kaibab NF are working
on a pinyon-juniper grassland restoration project and

Page	  10	  of	  11
they are interested in science support from ERI. The
involvement could include several projects in the
future.
 
Mixed Conifer LEARN Study Plots – Mogollon Rim
Ranger District, Coconino NF: Together with ERI’s
Research and Development group, staff continue to
facilitate the implementation of this long-term study
that will provide information about treatment
alternatives in Mexican spotted owl (MSO) habitat in
mixed conifer ecosystems. Recently, ERI finalized the
specific treatment descriptions for the study areas.
 
Tonto NF Forest Plan Revision – We are assisting
the forest in their Forest Plan Revision by providing an
overview of ecological restoration concepts and a
historical overview of forested ecosystems on the
Tonto NF. We also are providing best available
science and a description of historic reference
conditions for consideration in the revised plan.
 
White Mountain Stewardship 10-Year Final
Report – Apache-Sitgreaves NF: Great progress is
being made in compiling the final report for the White
Mountain Stewardship Project, which concluded in
August 2014. Dr. Yeonsu Kim, NAU School of
Forestry, is compiling the economic assessment of the
contract, and most of the data collection and surveys
for the project have been completed. We anticipate
the draft final report will be ready by September 2015.

The Western Environmental Law Center uses the
power of the law to safeguard the wildlife, wildlands,
and communities of the American West. WELC has a
highly experienced team of expert attorneys,
conservation biologists, and Western policy experts.
As a public interest law firm, WELC does not charge
clients and partners for services, but relies instead on
charitable gifts from individuals, families, and
foundations to accomplish its mission. In a joint effort
to provide collaborative groups of Collaborative Forest
Landscape Restoration (CFLR) projects with
information about the U.S. Forest Service’s
administrative and judicial review process, WELC and
ERI produced a white paper titled “Administrative and
Legal Review Opportunities for Collaborative Groups.”
In partnership with the National Forest Foundation,
the author, WELC staff attorney Susan Jane Brown,
will present a peer learning session about the paper
on April 16. To learn more about the peer learning
session and to sign up, click here.
