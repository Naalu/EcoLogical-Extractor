Intermountain West Frequent-fire Forest Restoration
Ecological restoration is a practice that seeks to heal degraded ecosystems by 
reestablishing native species, structural characteristics, and ecological processes.  
The Society for Ecological Restoration International defines ecological restoration  
as “an intentional activity that initiates or accelerates the recovery of an ecosystem  
with respect to its health, integrity and sustainability….Restoration attempts to  
return an ecosystem to its historic trajectory” (Society for Ecological Restoration 
International Science & Policy Working Group 2004).
Most frequent-fire forests throughout the Intermountain West have been degraded 
during the last 150 years. Many of these forests are now dominated by unnaturally 
dense thickets of small trees, and lack their once diverse understory of grasses, sedges, 
and forbs. Forests in this condition are highly susceptible to damaging, stand-replacing 
fires and increased insect and disease epidemics. Restoration of these forests centers on 
reintroducing frequent, low-severity surface fires—often after thinning dense stands—
and reestablishing productive understory plant communities. 
The Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University is a pioneer in 
researching, implementing, and monitoring ecological restoration of frequent-fire forests 
of the Intermountain West. By allowing natural processes, such as low-severity fire, 
to resume self-sustaining patterns, we hope to reestablish healthy forests that provide 
ecosystem services, wildlife habitat, and recreational opportunities.
The Forest Stewards Guild practices and promotes responsible forestry as a means of 
sustaining the integrity of forest ecosystems and the human communities dependent upon 
them. The Guild engages in education, training, policy analysis, research, and advocacy to 
foster excellence in stewardship, support practicing foresters and allied professionals, and 
engage a broader community in the challenges of forest conservation and management. 
The Southwest Fire Science Consortium (SWFSC) is a way for managers, scientists, and 
policy makers to interact and share science. SWFSC’s goal is to see the best available 
science used to make management decisions and scientists working on the questions 
managers need answered. The SWFSC tries to bring together localized efforts to develop 
scientific information and to disseminate that to practitioners on the ground through  
an inclusive and open process.

MANAGED WILDFIRE: A RESEARCH SYNTHESIS AND OVERVIEW

Executive Summary
All wildfires in the United States are managed, but the 
strategies used to manage them vary by region and season. 
“Managed wildfire” is a response strategy to naturally ignited 
wildfires; it does not prioritize full suppression and allows 
the fire to fulfill its natural role on the landscape, meeting 
objectives such as firefighter safety, resource benefit, and 
community protection. This wildfire management strategy can 
be effective for reducing tree densities, landscape homogeneity, 
fuel load continuity, and future fire behavior, while also working 
to reintroduce fire to fire-prone ecosystems. Research on 
managed wildfire has expanded significantly in recent years. 
This synthesis is designed to distill the current science on 
managed wildfire to foster a wide discussion of the strategy 
among managers, practitioners, and the knowledgeable public.
Managed wildfire has been in use since at least the 1910s in 
the federal land management realm, despite falling in and 
out of public and political favor over the intervening decades. 
Managers currently manage wildfires for resource benefit and 
community safety on hundreds of thousands of acres each year. 
Accurately tracking the use of managed wildfire is fraught 
and likely underestimated because of reporting and naming 
inconsistencies. Overall, the absence of a consistent title for the 
strategy invites internal and external confusion, disincentivizes 
use of the strategy, and makes assessment, monitoring, research, 
and communication difficult.
Based on the existing literature, significant policy, regulatory, 
physical, and social barriers impede the use of managed 
wildfire. For fire managers, use of this strategy requires a 
complex decision-making process that includes consideration 
of institutional influences, operational considerations, fire 
outcomes, fire environment, perceived risk, and sociopolitical 
context. Some new treatment and response planning tools, such 
as Potential Operational Delineations (PODs), may facilitate 
greater use by easing some of these barriers and concerns. The 
scale of the wildfire challenge across the country suggests that, 
in the future, managed wildfire will play an essential role in 
managing fuels, reducing burn severity, enhancing suppression 
effectiveness, fostering forest resilience, and improving human’s 
ability to coexist with fire.

Introduction
In fire-adapted forests across the western United States, 
unnatural fuel-loading resulting from decades of wildfire 
suppression, extreme drought, and climate-change-driven 
aridification have created conditions that leave forests 
more vulnerable to insects, pests, disease, and high-severity 
wildfires (North et al. 2021). The frequency, size, and severity 
of wildfires have increased significantly in recent decades 
(Abatzoglou et al. 2021, Singleton et al. 2021). Post-fire 
impacts such as flooding and debris flows can damage 
ecosystems, infrastructure, and communities more than 
the flames (Fraser et al. 2022). In response, land managers 
are faced with the challenge of restoring forest resilience 
and preventing large high-severity wildfires (North et al. 
2021, Schoennagel et al. 2017) while balancing social and 
environmental constraints (Sample et al. 2022).
Tools for reducing the threat of wildfires to communities 
and ecosystems include fostering fire-adapted communities, 
education and implementation programs, fuel reduction 
thinning, and reintroduction of fire. Home mitigation measures 
can be crucial for reducing loss (Meldrum et al. 2022). Fire-
adapted communities are more resilient to wildfire but are 
most effective when paired with efforts to reduce fire threat 
in the adjacent wildlands (FAC Net 2022, Toman et al. 2013). 
The scientific consensus highlights the ability of fuel reduction 
treatments to change fire behavior (Prichard et al. 2021), with 
numerous studies documenting the efficacy of fuel treatments 
in a range of conditions (e.g., Kalies and Yocom Kent 2016). 
Mechanical or hand thinning, while efficacious, is expensive 
and often limited by physical or administrative constraints 
(Hartsough et al. 2008, North et al. 2015). Treatments that 
combine thinning and surface fuel reduction, which in most 
cases means the use of fire, are the most effective at moderating 
wildfire behavior (Cansler et al. 2022, Evans et al. 2011, 
Kalies and Yocom Kent 2016, Martinson and Omi 2013). 
Prescribed fire is usually the most cost-effective tool to reduce 
surface fuels, particularly over large areas (Cleaves et al. 2000, 
Hartsough et al. 2008). Prescribed fire, especially multiple burns 
over an interval of years, can reduce the threat of high-severity 
wildfire (Collins and Stephens 2007, Stephens and Moghaddas 
2005) and drought-driven mortality (van Mantgem et al. 2021). 
The need for reintroduction of fire to fire-adapted landscapes 
is widely recognized. The Guidance for Implementation of 
Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy asserts that “fire, 
as a critical natural process, will be integrated into land and 
resource management plans and activities on a landscape 
scale, and across agency boundaries” (USDA and USDOI 
2009). Prescribed fire has been used as a management tool by 
the indigenous peoples who first populated North America 
since time immemorial, early European settlers since the 19th 
century, and private landowners and government land managers 
since the 1930s (Fillmore et al. 2021, Roos et al. 2022). Despite 
its widespread use, prescribed burning is subject to a range 
of social (smoke, proximity to homes, public concern) and 
operational (accessibility, slope, environmental conditions) 
considerations that limit the scope and range of its application 
(Quinn-Davidson and Varner 2011, Ryan et al. 2013). Another 
tool to reintroduce fire and increase forest resilience that is 
gaining renewed interest is the management of naturally 
ignited wildfire for objectives such as resource benefit and 
community safety. 
While prescribed fire involves deliberately igniting fire to 
burn in a planned and controlled manner to achieve land 
management objectives, managed wildfire entails managing 
wildfire for an objective “other than full suppression.” Rather 
than suppress select wildfires as soon as possible, at the 
smallest possible size, practitioners manage them in a way 
that achieves ecologically beneficial outcomes and enhances 
community safety. This approach is difficult because of potential 
escape, perceived risk, sociopolitical hinderances, operational 
limitations, and problematic fire environments. This report, 
which focuses on the realm of federal wildfire response, 
reviews the current research on these “managed wildfires.” The 
aim of this synthesis is to provide a scientific foundation for 
continuing discussion of managed wildfires among managers, 
practitioners, policy makers, the wider community, and across 
research disciplines. Research on the topic has expanded 
significantly in recent years without an accessible synthesis that 
spans scientific disciplines. The following sections summarize 
the history, terms used for the approach, ecological effects, 
policy context, and potential future of managed wildfire. 
History of Wildland Fire Response and 
Nomenclature
One of the difficulties in studying or discussing the 
management of wildfires for ecological benefit and resource 
objectives is the absence of a common name. The concept has 
had many titles over the past century, all of which reference 
the basic intention to react to wildfire ignitions in a way which 
does not prioritize full suppression and potentially allows for 
the fire to fulfill its natural role on the landscape. This report 
uses the phrase “managed wildfire,” but fire management 
history includes a multitude of names for the approach. 
Homo sapiens, and before them Homo erectus, have been using 
fire for more than 400,000 years (Anderson 2006). Indigenous 
peoples across the continent have been using fire since at 
least 12,550 BCE for a range of objectives such as hunting, 
crop management, increased plant yield, pest management, 
fire hazard reduction, and warfare (Allen 2002, Cooper 1960, 
Roos et al. 2022, Stewart et al. 2002) as well as managing 
fuels around communities (Roos et al. 2021). By the 1890s, 
European settlement resulted in an emphasis on suppression of 
wildfires (Fowler and Konopik 2007). One of central missions 
of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service 
when it was established in 1905 was fire suppression. Over the 
next century, full suppression became the preeminent response 
to wildfire. However, there have been efforts to use strategies 
other than full suppression over much of that time (van 
Wagtendonk 2007).

From 1916 to 1919, California implemented and dissolved 
a program based on the fiscal burden of full suppression to 
allow low-intensity wildfires to spread in remote areas unless 
they threatened high-value timber or improvements. In the 
1960s, the National Park Service implemented programs to 
take advantage of wildfires. Saguaro National Park named their 
approach “natural prescribed fire” while Yosemite National 
Park called their program “natural fire management” (van 
Wagtendonk 2007). The Forest Service followed suite in 1972 
with the experimental White Cap Fire Management Area, 
recognizing “fire as an element of wilderness environments and 
the need for a more natural incidence of fire” (Beckman 2007). 
The 1995 Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy and Program 
Review gave the Forest Service definition of “prescribed 
natural fire” as “allow(ing) lightning-caused fires to play, as 
nearly as possible, their natural ecological role in Wilderness.” 
This report recommended that “planning should consider all 
wildland fires, regardless of ignition source, as opportunities to 
meet management objectives” (Philpot et al., 1995). The policy 
change in 1995 gave rise to the phrase “wildland fire use for 
resource benefit,” or more simply “wildland fire use” (Miller 
2003). Managers and researchers have used other terms such 
as “let burn,” “natural fire,” “wilderness fire,” “ecological fire 
use,” “appropriate management response,” and “wildland fire 
use” (Fillmore et al. 2021). It is worth highlighting that during 
this period much of the focus for managed wildfire was on 
wilderness areas where other management options are limited 
(Hunter et al. 2014, Miller and Aplet 2016) and that these 
policies produced public outcry against public agencies,  
which were seen as having a “scorched earth” policy (van  
Wagtendonk 2007).
By 2008, the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG) 
was referring to “wildfires managed for resource benefit 
objectives” (NWCG 2008). This was shortened to “resource 
objective wildfire” in many publications (Meyer 2015, Scott et 
al. 2012). Similarly, the 2014 National Cohesive Wildland Fire 
Management Strategy referred to this strategy as “managing 
wildfire for resource objectives” and alternately “wildfire for 
resource benefit” (USDA and USDOI 2014). In 2018, the 
national Incident Management Situation Report (IMSR) 
identified the percentage of each wildfire that was managed 
with a monitor, confine, point protection, or suppression 
strategy. In doing so, IMSR referred to managing wildfires for 
objectives “other than full suppression” (Fillmore et al. 2021).
Difficulties with Names
The challenge of producing a common name for the strategy 
is condensing a complicated risk-based response into a short 
useable phrase. Most recently, “managed wildfire” has become 
a common term for the management of natural ignitions in a 
way that provides for safety of firefighters, achieves resource 
objectives, and enhances the resilience of communities. Some 
tension exists around the use of the term “managed wildfire,” as 
federal agencies are careful to state that all fires are managed, 
albeit using different response strategies. A 2022 letter from the 
Chief of the Forest Service emphasized this point:
“We do not have a ‘let it burn’ policy. The Forest 
Service’s policy is that every fire receives a strategic, 
risk-based response, commensurate with the threats 
and opportunities, and uses the full spectrum of 
management actions, that consider fire and fuel 
conditions, weather, values at risk, and resources 
available and that is in alignment with the 
applicable Land and Resource Management Plan” 
(Moore 2022).

Unfortunately, until the wildfire community settles on a shared 
lexicon, it will be difficult to track, measure, and understand 
managed wildfires. Various wildfire incident databases refer to 
the strategy using different names throughout time, making 
comparison difficult (Young et al. 2020). Even communication 
between land managers can become clouded because of 
differing terminology (Davis et al. 2022). Differentiation is 
also important because, as the following sections highlight, 
managed wildfires differ from full suppression wildfires in 
where, when, and how they burn.
Effects of Managing Wildfire for 
Resource Benefit
In general, wildfire has a moderating effect on subsequent fires. 
A study in Washington found that for ten years after wildfire, 
subsequent fires experienced reduced severity (Cansler et al. 
2022). This effect was found to be true for managed wildfire 
in a recent synthesis of science-based management strategies 
to foster resilient forests, which concluded “managed wildfires 
generally burn under more moderate weather conditions and 
contribute to variable fire effects and surface fuel reduction that 
can mitigate future wildfire severity” (Prichard et al. 2021). 
Severity and Forest Structure
A systematic review of 37 research papers on managed wildfires 
found they were effective for reducing tree density and future 
fire behavior (Huffman et al. 2020). The review also found an 
increase in vegetation heterogeneity and invasive species where 
fires burned with high severity. An important caveat from 
the systematic review is that the managed wildfires studied 
tended not to reduce tree densities enough to return to forests’ 
historical ranges (Huffman et al. 2020). For example, a study 
of 10 managed wildfires in northern Arizona found 85 percent 
of the collective burn footprint was classified as unburned/low 
severity, but areas of moderate burn severity were more likely 
to help restore forests to their historical range of variability 
(Huffman et al. 2017). Even repeat entry managed wildfires 
with predominantly low severity effects in northern Arizona do 
not appear as effective for returning forests to a more resilient 
state as a single managed wildfire with moderate severity effects 
(Huffman et al. 2018). Across the same area, low-severity 
managed wildfires have not increased landscape heterogeneity 
enough to replicate historical patterns (Donager et al. 2021). 
Modeling suggests that moderate-severity managed wildfires 
would be required to restore historical conditions in dry forests 
of eastern Oregon (Greenler et al. 2023). Repeat low-severity 
fires in the Gila National Forest did reduce the probability of 
future high-severity wildfire (Hunter et al. 2011). A study of 
735 wildfires from 1984 to 2017 in Arizona and New Mexico 
found the size of high-severity patches in managed wildfires 
tended to be within the historical range of variability for 
both wet and dry conifer forests (Singleton et al. 2021). These 
findings align with a study from California that found fire 
severity patterns for managed wildfires were overwhelmingly 
within the natural range of variation and greater proportions 
of moderate severity help forests return to historical conditions 
(Meyer 2015). An analysis of 1,434 wildfires in the Southwest 
and California found that nearly 89 percent of managed 
wildfires and 67 percent of full suppression wildfires burned 
less than 20 percent of the total area at high severity (Iniguez et 
al. 2022). Managed wildfires in the Southwest tend to have less 
high severity than those in California. 
Other Effects
In addition to positive effects on forest structure, bringing fire 
back to fire-adapted forests benefits streams and rivers. Fostering 
a natural fire regime in Yosemite National Park for over 40 years 
has helped promote a healthy water system and drought-induced 
tree mortality has declined (Boisramé et al. 2019). The area also 
has improved landscape and species diversity as a result of the 
use of managed wildfire (Stephens et al. 2021). The Selway-
Bitterroot Wilderness, the Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex, 
and the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness provide 
long-term, on-the-ground examples of managed wildfire, 
furthering the goals of fire-safe communities and resilient 
ecosystems (Berkey et al. 2021). Although managed wildfire is 
more common in the western US, a study from Arkansas shows 
the potential for using the approach to move forest structure 
and composition toward an open woodland condition in the 
Ouachita Mountains (McDaniel et al. 2020).
Risks
Increased management of wildfire for resource objectives will 
enlarge the area burned each year in the near term (Barros 
et al. 2018, Young et al. 2022). This growth could be seen as

valuable given the fire deficit in most fire-adapted forests, but an 
increase in burned area is not universally viewed as a benefit. A 
simulation study of the Cascade Mountains of Oregon indicated 
managed wildfire “can improve forest resilience and contribute to 
restoration efforts in fire-adapted forests,” but potential tradeoffs 
include increased smoke and declines in certain types of wildlife 
habitat (e.g., decadent mixed conifer) (Barros et al. 2018).
Managed wildfire is not without risk, predominantly the 
risk of a wildfire spreading beyond the planned area and 
threatening communities (Ager et al. 2017). A simulation 
of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness estimated that wildfires 
that ignited in the interior had a less than one percent chance 
of burning outside of the wilderness area (Barnett et al. 2016). 
There are examples of managed wildfires escaping planned 
boundaries (e.g., 2009 Mill Flat Fire in Utah, 2017 Bonita 
Fire in New Mexico (Davis et al. 2022), and the 2006 Warm 
Fire in Arizona (Timberlake et al. 2020)), but the difficulty 
in identifying and tracking managed wildfires means an 
exhaustive list of escapes is not available.
Current Use and Policy Context
Managed wildfires are a commonplace occurrence on the 
landscape. Over 900 large wildfires in the western US were 
managed across 3.9 million acres using strategies other than 
full suppression between 2002 and 2016 (Young et al. 2020). 
In 2009, managers used natural ignitions to return fire to 
over 250,000 acres in the Southwest region alone (Young 
et al. 2020). The combined footprint of managed wildfires 
in the western contiguous United States covers an average 
of 268,000 acres annually compared to 2.9 million acres of 
wildfires managed with a full suppression strategy (Young et 
al. 2020). 
A strategy other than full suppression is chosen more often 
later in the season, usually starting after dangerous wildfires 
have been controlled and when managers know that a 
season-ending weather event is likely in the next six to eight 
weeks. Because managed wildfires generally burn under 
cool, moist, and moderate weather conditions, they tend to 
exhibit low to moderate fire severity (Meyer 2015). Managers 
are, understandably, more willing to manage wildfires for 
resource and community benefit when weather conditions are 
conducive to control and lower intensity (Young et al. 2020). 
A sample of managed wildfires in Arizona and New Mexico 
found they tended to occur when relative humidity was high, 
wind speeds were low, and fine fuel moistures were high 
(Huffman et al. 2017).
There are important regional differences in how and where 
wildfires are managed for resource and community benefit. 
For example, managed wildfires in California tend to be closer 
to wilderness and to have a larger percentage of high severity 
compared to managed wildfires in the Southwest (Iniguez et al. 
2022). After 2009, the number of managed wildfires increased 
in the Inland Empire, Rocky Mountains, and Southwest 
regions while other regions, such as California, continued to 
utilize suppression strategies for most large fires (Young et al. 
2020). Managed wildfires are less likely than full suppression 
wildfires to involve multiple responding agencies and entities 
(Iniguez et al. 2022). Detailed case studies of managed wildfire 
found opportunities and obstacles to the strategy were “strongly 
shaped by local interagency and cross-jurisdictional contexts” 
(Davis et al. 2022).
Policy and Planning 
In addition to temporal and geographic differences, policy is 
an important factor in determining if wildfires are managed 
with strategies other than full suppression (Franz et al. in 
preparation). Current federal wildland fire management policy 
highlights the myriad factors that influence the decision on 
how to react to wildfires:
“Response to wildland fires is based on ecological, 
social, and legal consequences of the fire. The 
circumstances under which a fire occurs, and the likely 
consequences on firefighter and public safety and 
welfare, natural and cultural resources, and values to 
be protected, dictate the appropriate response to the 
fire” (USDA and USDOI 2009).
Current policy makes available a full range of wildland fire 
response strategies to meet management objectives, including 
containing, confining, or suppressing the wildfire (USDA and 
USDOI 2009). 
Federal Policy
The 2009 federal interagency policy guidance allows 
federal land agencies to choose to implement multiple fire 
response strategies on a single wildfire, meaning that they 
can simultaneously suppress one portion of the fire while 
managing another for resource benefit (Iniguez et al. 2022, 
USDA and USDOI 2009). This provides managers the 
option to use the most appropriate strategy for a particular 
area based on risk assessments. The 2009 federal policy 
guidance gave incident commanders greater leniency in 
managing a single ignition, leading to as much as a 73 
percent increase in the number of managed wildfires over 
pre-2009 figures (Young et al. 2020). Even after policy 
changed to expand managers’ options, managed wildfires 
still tend to be located closer to wilderness areas and farther 
from the WUI (Iniguez et al. 2022). 
Forest Plans
Fire management still occurs within the framework of 
forest plans developed in compliance with the National 
Environmental Policy Act. Creating a forest plan can take years 
owing to the requirements for in-depth analysis and public 
input. This delay can result in outdated forest plans, which may 
not include the option for some resource management tools 
such as managed wildfire (Schultz et al. 2019, Steelman and 
McCaffrey 2011). For example, the Kaibab National Forest 
to was able to manage wildfires like the 2017 Boundary Fire 
thanks to justification provided in a new forest management 
plan (Timberlake et al. 2020).

Challenges to Implementing a  
Managed Wildfire Strategy
A review of managed wildfire literature produced a fire 
management decision-making framework that groups 
factors into six groups: institutional influences, operational 
considerations, fire outcomes, fire environment, perceived risk, 
and sociopolitical context (Fillmore et al. 2021). Based on this 
review, the largest impediments to using managed wildfire 
are operational concerns (on-the-ground considerations), risk 
aversion (fear of potential consequences), and the complexity 
of the decision-making process itself. In contrast, an individual 
decision-maker’s personal or professional desire to manage 
wildfire for resource and community benefit was often the 
main driver for use of the strategy (Fillmore et al. 2021). This 
highlights managers’ and decision makers’ understanding 
of fire’s positive value and effectiveness in increasing forest 
resilience and community safety.
Operational Concerns
Operational considerations that limit managed wildfire include 
the dangerous accumulation of fuels in many forest stands, 
the landscape continuity of high fuel loading, location slope 
and aspect, and more (Young et al. 2020). Climate-change-
driven warming and drying trends and ensuing drought 
conditions increase potential severity of fire behavior, adding 
to the barriers to managed wildfire (Davis et al. 2022). The 
same high fuel loads, landscape continuity, and drought 
Local Influences 
Agency directives and culture also influence management 
decisions. In 2012, a deputy chief at the Forest Service issued a 
directive that required high-level approval to manage wildfires 
for resource benefit (Hubbard 2012). This directive appears to 
have reduced the number of managed wildfires in 2012 and 
2013 (Young et al. 2020). A similar directive in 2020 calling for 
the agency’s “predominant strategy being rapid containment” 
because of the health risk posed by the COVID-19 pandemic 
appears to have reduced the number of managed wildfires in 
the Southwest (Christiansen 2020, Lynch and Evans 2021). 
Again in 2021, the Chief of the Forest Service stated that “At 
this time … managing fires for resource benefit is a strategy 
we will not use” (Moore 2021). This directive was viewed 
as a setback by managers who had been managing wildfires 
for resource and community benefit (Davis et al. 2022). In 
California, Title 17 of the Code of Regulations (air quality) 
requires “registration” of, smoke management plans for, and 
potentially elicits fees for the smoke from wildfires managed 
for resource benefits (DODSR 2001). Managers may be 
using strategies that may not appear to be traditional “full 
suppression” but are still labeled “full suppression” in part to 
help navigate the complex intra-agency and local impediments 
to utilization of this strategy (Davis et al. 2022). Agency 
directives and culture are important institutional influences on 
the managed wildfire decision-making process and are woven 
into many other challenges to using wildfire for resource and 
community benefit.

wildfire (referred to as “wildland fire use” at the time) revealed 
that 91 percent of them did so because of their personal 
commitment to the strategy (Williamson 2007).
Cost
Cost is unlikely to be a primary driver for the decision to use 
managed wildfire, but when and where wildfires can be managed 
for resource and community objectives, they may cost less 
than full suppression wildfires (Gebert and Black 2012). For 
example, the Forest Service used the 2011 Long Fire for resource 
benefit on nearly 500 acres of the El Dorado National Forest 
for approximately $583 per acre, which is significantly less than 
the other management options analyzed in the area (Holland et 
al. 2022). Of the 12 largest wildfires in the Southwest in 2015, 
the average cost per acre where a suppression strategy was used 
was $85, while the average cost per acre where wildfire was 
managed with other strategies was $73 (Evans 2016). A similar 
comparison in 2016 found $287 per acre for full suppression and 
$199 per acre for other strategies (Evans 2017). Other studies 
suggest as much as a 10-fold cost differential between wildfires 
managed with full suppression versus other strategies (Beasley 
and Ingalsbee 2021). The lower per acre cost may be because 
managed wildfires usually burn during weather conditions that 
are less conducive to rapid fire growth and away from populated 
areas, therefore requiring fewer resources to manage (Iniguez et 
al. 2022). Another factor may be the reduced need for aircraft 
during managed wildfires compared to full suppression wildfires. 
While strategies other than full suppression may have a lower 
cost per acre or daily cost, total expenses may be similar to full 
suppression wildfires because of their longer durations and larger 
total burn areas (Gebert and Black 2012). Where managed 
wildfires reduce fuels, they may also reduce the risk and cost of 
responding to future wildfires that burn through the same area.
Potential Operational Delineations
For use in fire response, the Potential Operational 
Delineations (PODs) adaptive framework utilizes pre-
identified containment features coupled with values at risk 
to plan for and manage the geographical spread of wildfires. 
These boundaries are created from fire containment data 
such as roads, ridgetops, and fuel transitions (Thompson 
et al. 2020). PODs strive to provide cross-boundary 
and collaborative utility for planning, communication, 
coordination, prioritization, incident response strategy 
development, fuels mitigation, and forest restoration. Teams 
create PODs based on geospatial decision support models and 
expert local knowledge, allowing decision makers to develop 
a range of wildfire response options for an entire landscape 
prior to the fire season. PODs can aid the development of 
wildfire response strategies based on values at risk, modeled 
fire behavior, as well as serving as an educational tool for 
community outreach. Management strategies can include 
management of natural ignitions for the most advantageous 
ecological and community outcomes (Thompson et al. 2022).
Implementation of the PODs methodology and careful 
preplanning allowed for the successful management of the 
naturally ignited 2017 Pinal Fire for resource benefit by the 
conditions that create barriers to managed wildfire create the 
conditions for wildfire seasons that are longer and more intense. 
Fire management resources may be increasingly limited for 
managed wildfires because more large, high-severity wildfires 
that require full suppression are burning on the landscape 
simultaneously (Williamson 2007, Young et al. 2020). 
Communication and Public Support
Effective community outreach and engagement around forest 
management projects such as prescribed fire is vital “to address 
possible barriers to implementation related to a lack of social 
acceptance” (Novak et al. 2022). Likewise, public support 
is a key factor for the successful use of managed wildfire, 
particularly in forested landscapes closer to communities. For 
prescribed fire, fostering understanding of the purpose and 
intended benefits helps build public approval (McCaffrey 
2006). One fire manager captured this sentiment, saying “if we 
didn’t have that public support, and you have a bad day, you 
evacuate town, you’ll never use fire again in your neighborhood” 
(Timberlake et al. 2020). As the wildland-urban interface 
expands and more homes are built in areas at risk of wildfire, 
the potential for public support to facilitate or limit managed 
wildfire will also increase.
Managed wildfire lacks some of the prescriptive and 
administrative controls of prescribed fire even though it creates 
the same strategic outcome, a discrepancy that leads to distrust 
or hesitancy among some fire managers and members of the 
public (Fillmore et al. 2021). While there is no policy dictum 
to use this strategy only under moderate weather conditions, 
that is the logical outcome based on risk management and 
the requirement that “response to wildland fires is based on 
ecological, social and legal consequences of the fire” (USDA 
and USDOI 2009). Various national forests have interpreted 
this guidance to mean that managed wildfire decisions will 
consider effects on vegetation mortality, the public, and other 
values based on actual and predicted fire weather and fire 
behavior modeling. The Wildland Fire Decision Support 
System (WFDSS) can be and is used to forecast the conditions 
where the use of managed wildfire could achieve resource 
objectives (Fillmore et al. 2023). 
Risk and perception of risk are key obstacles to managing 
wildfires for resource and community benefit. Landowners, 
management agencies, and elected officials who use managed 
wildfire face, or perceive themselves to face, heightened 
personal and organizational risk in the short term and receive 
little direct benefit from the long-term risk reduction managed 
wildfires can provide (Dunn et al. 2019). Because a full 
suppression strategy is used with most wildfires, there is also 
a status quo bias and cultural tendency in the Forest Service 
against managed wildfire (Wilson et al. 2011). 
Drivers of Managed Wildfire Use
Managers and decision makers who do take on the risk of 
managed wildfires often do so because they believe in the 
strategy’s benefits and efficacy (Fillmore et al. 2021). A study 
of Forest Service district rangers who authorized managed

communities and land managers across the western US 
will involve managed wildfire. Managing natural ignitions 
for resource and community benefit during moderate 
weather conditions offers hope for limiting future wildfire 
spread, reducing burn severity, and enhancing suppression 
effectiveness (Thompson et al. 2018). A model of forest 
treatments and management in northern Arizona found that 
including managed wildfire reduced the projected proportion 
of high-severity impacts even though the total area burned 
was projected to increase (Young et al. 2022). 
Managed wildfire must also be part of climate change 
planning and solutions (Sample et al. 2022). A simulation 
for Lake Tahoe, California that incorporated the effects of a 
warming and drying climate found that the most effective risk 
reduction approach included selective use of managed wildfire 
(Evans et al. 2022). Based on the ecological studies described 
above, managed wildfires may have to be administered to burn 
a greater proportion of areas at moderate severity to build 
forest resilience. 
On average, less than 0.5 percent of wildland fire ignitions 
have been allowed to burn as managed wildfires (North et al. 
2015). An increase in the frequency and severity of managed 
wildfires will require careful risk management such as use 
of the PODs adaptive framework and clear communication 
with the public. However, these challenges should be seen not 
as barriers but as logical and necessary next steps to increase 
utilization and facilitation of a restorative and cost-efficient 
forest management tool.
Forest Service (O’Connor and Calkin 2019). Teams elected 
to use the strategy of backing surface fire to control wildfire 
growth, consume abundant downed woody fuels, reduce 
the number of seedlings and saplings, remove fuel jackpots, 
and restore fire resilience to the ecosystem. Another spatial 
planning tool that may aid in reducing the logistical barriers to 
use of managed wildfire is Potential Control Locations (PCLs), 
or identification of areas where large fires have historically 
tended to stop or lull due to topographic features such as lakes, 
ridges, and rivers (Stratton 2020). Both tools may be used 
together for optimal planning.
The Future of Managed Wildfire
Pyrosilviculture, or the use of prescribed fire to meet 
management objectives through fire alone or by altering 
silvicultural treatments to optimize the incorporation 
of prescribed fire in the future (York et al. 2021), has 
gained attention as a tool to increase the pace and scale of 
forest restoration through reduced stand density in fire-
adapted landscapes. North and colleagues, as well as other 
researchers in the western US, have expanded this approach 
to recommend using pyrosilviculture to maintain wildfire-
treated areas (those burned at low to moderate severity) and 
to identify managed wildfire zones where initial treatments 
would be achieved using naturally occurring fire (North et 
al. 2021).
