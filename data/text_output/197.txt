Abstract.
The 2002 Rodeo–Chediski fire, the largest wildfire in south-western USA history, burned over treated stands
and adjacent untreated stands in the Apache–Sitgreaves National Forest, setting the stage for a natural experiment testing
the effectiveness of fuel reduction treatments under conditions of extraordinary fire severity. In seven pairs of treated–
untreated study sites measured 2 years after the fire, thinning was strongly associated with reduced burn severity. Treated
areas had more live trees, greater survival, and reduced fire intensity as indicated by crown base height and bole char.
Ponderosa pine regeneration was patchy but more dense in treated areas. We assessed decade- to century-long effects of
the pre-wildfire fuel treatments using the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS). Differences between treated and untreated
areas were projected to persist for several decades after the fire in terms of stand structure characteristics and for at least
100 years in terms of species composition, with ponderosa pine making up ∼60% of basal area in treated areas but only
35% in untreated areas. Future ecosystem development may take the trajectory of recovery to a ponderosa pine/Gambel
oak forest or of a shift to an alternative stable state such as an oak-dominated shrubfield, with untreated areas more apt to
undergo a shift to a shrubfield state. Current management decisions about fuel treatments have multi-century legacies.

Introduction
Wildfires in frequent-fire-adapted ecosystems of the western
USA are becoming larger and more severe in part due to changes
in forest structure caused by fire suppression, selective logging
of large trees, and livestock grazing occurring after extensive
European–American settlement (Covington and Moore 1994;
Swetnam et al. 1999). Stand treatments such as pre-commercial
thinning, prescribed burning, and restoration to pre-settlement
conditions have been projected to decrease the susceptibility
of treated stands to crownfire due to their reduction of forest
floor fuels, ladder fuels and canopy fuels, which can prevent fire
from reaching the canopy and from transitioning from a passive
crownfire (torching) to an active crownfire (Deeming 1990; van
Wagtendonk 1996; Stephens 1998; Covington et al. 2001; Fulé
et al. 2001; Brose and Wade 2002).
Several short-term empirical studies have examined adjacent
treated and untreated stands after wildfire, reporting that areas
that underwent fuel reduction treatments experienced lower burn
severity (Agee et al. 2000; Martinson and Omi 2003). Some
werenon-systematicinvestigations,focussedonslashtreatments
rather than prescribed burning and thinning, or were based solely
on remotely sensed data without field verification (Wagle and
Eakle 1979; Omi and Kalabokidis 1991; Vihanek and Ottmar
1993). Weatherspoon and Skinner (1995) found that burn sever-
ity was greater in commercially harvested stands, but the stands
they sampled had not been pre-commercially treated. Because
conventional timber harvesting without pre-commercial thin-
ning generally does not reduce ladder fuels, which contribute
to crownfire susceptibility, it cannot be strictly considered a fuel
reduction treatment (Agee and Skinner 2005).
Pollet and Omi (2002) and Omi and Martinson (2002) sys-
tematically examined the effect of fuel reduction treatments for
eight wildfires, six of these in western ponderosa pine. Both
studies found that burn severity and crown scorch were signif-
icantly lower in all treated areas. These studies can be used to
make a more generalised statement about treatment effect on
burn severity. Because the treatments for each wildfire differed,
however, treatment effect cannot be clearly separated from the
effect that the location and seasonality of the wildfire may have
had on burn severity. Pollet and Omi (2002) questioned whether
fuel treatments would have any effect under extreme fire con-
ditions, as drought and high winds may play a more important
role in fire behaviour than fuels. Cram and Baker (2003) also
systematically investigated silvicultural treatment effect after
four wildfires, including the Rodeo–Chediski burn area within
the Apache–Sitgreaves National Forest. They found that treated
areas up to 20 years old experienced lower burn severity, ground
char, and fireline intensity as estimated from bole char.
There has been extensive empirical research on the long-term
changes in pine-dominated forests after wildfire (Foxx 1996;
Barton 2002; Gracia et al. 2002; Greene et al. 2004; Savage
and Mast 2005), and several studies have also modelled for-
est dynamics after wildfire, though not all in pine forests (He
et al. 2002; Retana et al. 2002; Chapin et al. 2003). Several of
these long-term studies of forest recovery after wildfire have
questioned whether forests that historically had a frequent fire

regime are resilient to crownfire, adding to the widespread con-
cern about future development of arid forests such as those of
the South-west as large, severe crownfires continue (Hessburg
et al. 2005). Studies in Arizona (Barton 2002), Mexico (Fulé
et al. 2000), and Spain (Retana et al. 2002) have indicated that
intense fire in pine–oak forests may result in a shift to a more oak-
dominated forest or a conversion to an alternative steady-state
such as a shrubfield or grassland. These shifts in species domi-
nance and conversions to what appears to be an alternative stable
state have been documented after crownfire in several dense pon-
derosa pine forests by Savage and Mast (2005).Alternative stable
statesareself-perpetuatingspeciesassemblagesdistinctfromthe
typical assemblage found in a given environment; they may be
shorter in height (e.g. shrubs v. trees) and appear to be an earlier
sere, though without evidence of near-term shift back toward the
pre-crownfire forest. A shift to such an alternative state could
have substantial consequences for ecosystem functions and
potential land uses. For instance, some wildlife species such
as tassel-eared squirrels are dependent upon ponderosa pine,
and Gambel oak is much less economically valuable than the
ponderosa pine it could replace as the dominant tree species
(Barger and Ffolliott 1972; Blatner and Govett 1988; Linhart
1988; Petraitis and Latham 1999).
We selected the 189 000-ha Rodeo–Chediski fire of 2002,
the largest severe wildfire in south-western history. We mea-
sured the effects of pre-fire fuel reduction treatments on seven
paired treated–untreated sites, a relatively large and consistent
dataset, sufficient to support reliable assessment of short- and
long-term ecological response. We hypothesised that: (1) pre-
wildfire thinning would lead to greater tree survival compared
to that in untreated areas; (2) post-fire regeneration and shrubs,
and thus potential forest development, would display higher den-
sity of sprouting species in untreated areas; (3) effects of forest
structuralandcompositionaldifferenceswouldpersistforatleast
several decades following the fire; and (4) untreated areas would
be more likely to transition from ponderosa pine forest to an
oak-dominated shrubfield.
Methods
Study area
The Rodeo–Chediski fire’s 189 000-ha span the Mogollon Rim in
east-central Arizona, including parts of the Apache–Sitgreaves
National Forest and White Mountain Apache tribal lands. This
present study focussed on the portion of the burn area in the
Apache–Sitgreaves National Forest. Climate averages for 1971–
2000 from the Heber Ranger Station on the north-western
edge of the burn area (Western Regional Climate Center,
http://www.wrcc.dri.edu, accessed 15 January 2005) were: July
maximum temperature 29.2◦C, January minimum temperature
−7.8◦C, annual precipitation 50.6 cm, and annual snowfall
99.3 cm (1950–2004 average). The study sites ranged in ele-
vation from 1990 to 2138 m. The soil type varied from clay
substrates to sandy loams, depending on the parent material;
alluvial gravels were present in drainages, and the Mogollon
Rim itself has a limestone bed. Forests were dominated by pon-
derosa pine with Gambel oak and New Mexico locust. Scientific
names of all species are given in Table 1.
Study sites
We sampled seven pairs of treated–untreated stands on the
Apache–Sitgreaves National Forest in May to August of 2004,
2 years after the Rodeo–Chediski fire (Fig. 1). To assess the
relationship between pre-fire fuel reduction treatments and fire
severity, shortly after the fire was controlled in 2002, Forest Ser-
vice staff assembled information on all the areas within the burn
perimeter that had been treated within 16 years before the fire.
A total of 14 sites met the criteria of having maps of the treat-
ment, adjacent untreated areas of similar topography, and no
road or other potential firebreak between treated and untreated
areas. Treated sites underwent non-commercial thinning for fuel
reduction followed by slash disposal (pile and burn, except for
one site where slash was lopped and scattered and one where
slash was crushed) between 1990 and 1999. Residual forest
stands were predominantly evenly spaced (average 3.8 m), small

(modal diameter 20 cm) ponderosa pines. Seven treated sites and
six paired untreated sites were sampled post-fire by the Forest
Service (Fig. 1); the seven measured sites were selected ran-
domly from the 14 potential sites. Untreated sites were selected
from adjacent stands with no evident difference in topography,
fuelbreak, or pre-thinning forest structure (USDA Forest Service
2002; L. Wadleigh and C. Hoffman, pers. comm. 2003, 2006).
We established a seventh untreated site in 2004 near the pre-
existing unpaired site. We located 10 plots in two systematic
grids of five plots at each study site for a total of 140 plots. Each
gridconsistedofplotsatthefourcornersofa100 × 100 msquare
and the fifth plot in the centre. Plots were located using a Garmin
Global Positioning System unit. Plots were permanently marked
with a tagged iron stake sunk to ground level at each plot centre.
Measurements
We measured overstorey trees on a variable-radius plot delin-
eated using a prism with a basal area factor of 2.2 m2 ha−1 per
tree.Tree measurements included species, condition, diameter at
breast height (dbh), total height, canopy base height, bole char
height (minimum and maximum), and dwarf mistletoe rating
(0–6) using Hawksworth’s (1977) scale. Tree condition classes
followed Thomas’ (1979) description: live, declining, and four
stages of snags (recent snag, loose-bark snag, clean snag, and
snag broken above breast height). We did not have direct mea-
surements of fire severity, but we inferred that bole char height
was correlated with fire intensity and we used the proportion of
tree mortality as a relative measure of fire severity. We did not
attempt to estimate foliar scorch because field measurements
were taken 2 years after the fire, so the majority of scorched
needles had already fallen. We collected increment cores from a
subsample of live trees (the live specimens of the first four trees
on the plot; trees were numbered starting at north and proceeding
clockwise around the plot) for age and growth increment data.
Tree increment cores were surfaced and cross-dated (Stokes and
Smiley 1968) or rings were counted for cores that could not be
cross-dated, such as juniper cores. For cores that missed the pith,
additional years to the centre were estimated with a pith locator
(Applequist 1958). Ten-year diameter growth increments were
measured (1994–2003, inclusive). We added living and dead
trees together to estimate pre-fire forest density and basal area.
Tree regeneration (sprouts and seedlings below breast height)
and shrubs were measured on a 0.00405-ha plot (3.6 m radius)
with origin at plot centre. Tree regeneration and shrubs were
tallied by species, condition (living or dead), and height class
(0–40 cm, 41–80 cm, 81–137 cm, or exact height of shrubs if
>137 cm). We measured forest floor fuels on a 15.2-m pla-
nar transect at a random azimuth from each plot centre, using
Brown’s (1974) method. We converted litter and duff depth to
forest floor fuel loadings in Mg ha−1 using coefficients from
Ffolliott et al. (1968).
Forest simulation modelling
Models that predict forest development fall into two gen-
eral classes: statistical models, based on well-measured growth
patterns, which can be quite accurate over short time periods;
and, process models, which simulate physiological processes
involved in growth and competition and thus can incorporate
environmental change, but require much more complex initia-
tion parameters.We used the ForestVegetation Simulator (FVS),
a statistical model of tree growth and yield (Dixon 2003). It is
initialised with standard mensurational data, and outputs both

stand-level and tree-level growth data by species. FVS has a
locallydevelopedsouth-westernponderosapinemodelwithhigh
precision (Edminster et al. 1991). Other species, such as oaks,
have been less well studied, so model outputs are likely to be
more uncertain.
We also considered using FVSBGC, which combines FVS
with STAND-BGC, a modified version of the FOREST-BGC
biogeochemical process model (Running and Coughlan 1988;
Running and Gower 1991). FVSBGC allows modelling of for-
est response to different climate and CO2 scenarios (Milner et al.
2003). However, test runs indicated that the model requires fur-
ther calibration before it can be used in south-western ponderosa
pine.
The Central Rockies/south-western ponderosa pine variant of
FVSwasusedtosimulatestanddevelopmentforeachtreatedand
untreated site for the next 100 years (2004–2104). We scaled the
diameter increment model with measured 10-year growth incre-
ments and developed height–age relationships from our core
data to reduce the site index from the default of 21.4 m per 100
years to 15.2 m per 100 years. Oak, juniper, and pine species
were grouped and New Mexico locust was treated as a generic
hardwood species for the purposes of the simulation.
We compared two different regeneration scenarios. The first,
Regen-1, was simply the regeneration by species measured in
2004. The second scenario, Regen-2, also used the measured
regeneration in 2004 but added a second regeneration event in
2024 based on average regeneration occurring 2–3 decades fol-
lowing crownfire in ponderosa pine forests as reported by Savage
and Mast (2005). Ponderosa pine density was tripled and on
sites where there were fewer than 50 stems ha−1 of the smallest
height class, we introduced 150 stems ha−1.This did not increase
ponderosa pine regeneration density in 2024 to a level equiva-
lent with the average reported by Mast and Savage (∼950 stems
ha−1), but it fell within the range they reported (117–2864 stems
ha−1). It would have been necessary to increase our measured
ponderosa pine regeneration by a factor of 28 to reach their aver-
age, and we did not believe such a large increase was justifiable.
In Regen-2, juniper regeneration was decreased by a factor of
0.15, and oak regeneration was decreased by a factor of 0.65.
Since the abundance of New Mexico locust on our study sites
was similar to that reported by Savage and Mast (2005), we did
not alter regeneration density for that species in Regen-2.
For each species and height class, expected survival per-
centages were estimated for both regeneration scenarios using
measurements of regeneration before restoration treatments for
two northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests (Fulé et al. 2001;
Waltz et al. 2003). Ponderosa pine survival was 100% for all
height classes, oak survival ranged from 9 to 45%, juniper sur-
vival ranged from 19 to 67%, and New Mexico locust survival
ranged from 65 to 72%.
Data analysis
We compared forest structural data in treated and untreated areas
using DISTLM (Anderson 2004), which performs a distribution-
free, distance-based multifactor multivariate analysis of variance
using permutation. We used the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity dis-
tance measure and carried out 999 permutations for each test.
Since the method used by DISTLM calculates an exact P-value,

tests are not adjusted for α inflation (Anderson and Robinson
2001). When testing overall regeneration and shrubs, we per-
formed both an unstandardised test and a test standardised by
species, in case the dominant species were skewing the results.
We used 95% confidence intervals to discern meaningful dif-
ferences between modelling results for treated and untreated
areas, and between the two regeneration scenarios.
Results
Pre- and post-ﬁre forest structure
Treated areas were strongly associated with lower tree mortality
when compared to untreated areas. Pre-fire diameter distribu-
tions in treated and untreated areas (as estimated by summing
living + fire-killed trees) were not significantly different accord-
ing to the characteristics we tested, but post-fire conditions were
very different (Tables 2 and 3). There were many more surviv-
ing trees in treated areas, and fire behaviour as indicated by bole
char height was less extreme than in untreated areas.
While average tree density was substantially greater in
untreated areas before the fire, there was no significant differ-
ence between treated and untreated areas. About half the trees in
treated areas survived the fire, compared to 5% in untreated areas
(Fig. 2). Post-fire density of live trees was significantly greater
in treated areas (Table 2, Fig. 2). At least some trees survived
on all of the study sites, but 66% of untreated plots and 11% of
treated plots had no live trees. Basal area was not significantly
different before the fire, but was significantly greater in treated
areas afterwards (Table 2, Fig. 2).
Crown base height and bole char height for live trees and
for all trees (living + dead) were significantly lower in treated
areas, indicating less intense fire behaviour (Table 3). Bole char
height for all trees was much higher than bole char for live trees,
suggesting that most surviving trees were in pockets of lower
than average fire intensity. The fire probably did not increase
crown base height in treated areas, since crown base height was

substantially higher than bole char height for all trees. It appears
to have done so in untreated areas, especially as crown base
height there was higher than in treated areas.
There were far more small trees in untreated areas than treated
areas before the fire, though pre-fire diameter distributions were
not significantly different. The fire shifted the distribution in
untreated areas strongly towards larger trees, but did not substan-
tially change the shape of the distribution in treated areas (Fig. 3).
About 95% of the surviving trees in both treated and untreated
areas were less than 100 years old, though treated areas may
have had slightly more old trees (data not shown). Many more
standing snags were present in untreated areas of two common
size classes used by many wildlife species (>30 cm dbh and
>50 cm dbh) (Table 3).
Initial post-ﬁre recovery
Initial post-fire recovery was relatively similar between treated
and untreated areas. Only fuel loadings and manzanita den-
sity were significantly different. Fuel loading in terms of fine
and coarse woody debris, as well as forest floor weight, were
substantially greater in treated areas (Table 3).
Regeneration was dominated by sprouting species such as
Gambel oak and alligator juniper, as well as by New Mexico
locust (Table 3). Regeneration levels were slightly, but not
significantly, more dense in untreated areas. Regeneration was
present on every study site and 86% of the plots. Oak regenera-
tion was present on all study sites and 68% of the plots.
On average, there was four times as much ponderosa pine
regeneration in treated areas (Table 3), but there was no signif-
icant difference between treatments because of its patchiness.
Ponderosa pine regeneration was found on only 6% of our
plots; on the site level, eight of 14 sites (five untreated, three
treated) had no ponderosa pine regeneration. In both treated and

untreated areas, small amounts of ponderosa pine regeneration in
the larger height classes appeared to have survived the fire. Live
ponderosa pine trees were present on all sites, but 41% of the
plots (67% untreated, 14% treated) had no surviving ponderosa
pines. Sixty-four percent of untreated plots and 11% of treated
plots had no surviving pines and no ponderosa pine regeneration.
Pinemat manzanita and Fendler’s ceanothus (Table 3) were
virtually the only shrubs present. While, overall, shrubs were
not significantly different on treated v. untreated areas, man-
zanita was 20 times more abundant in untreated areas, and so
was significantly different when considered separately.
Modelling
Differences between treated and untreated areas will likely per-
sist for at least the next several decades in terms of overall
forest structure characteristics (density, basal area, and quadratic
mean diameter) as indicated by our modelling of future forest
development using FVS. However, for the most part these dif-
ferences were characterised by wide 95% confidence intervals
(Fig. 4). Differences in relative species abundance and domi-
nance endured or increased over the entire 100-year simulation
period (Figs 4 and 5).
Treated areas initially had more trees, but as untreated areas
had more regeneration, they quickly became denser; this dif-
ference slowly declined over the course of the simulation.
All treatment and regeneration combinations led to some self-
thinning, but Regen-2 (scheduling measured regeneration in
2004 and adjusted regeneration in 2024) in untreated areas led to
an especially high pulse of density and a correspondingly steep
decline. After 100 years, treated and untreated areas were nearly
identical, but density under Regen-2 remained greater than that
underRegen-1(schedulingmeasuredregenerationonlyin2004).
Confidence intervals overlapped for the entire simulation, indi-
cating that the treatments were only meaningfully different at
the beginning of the simulation period in 2004.
Treated areas had significantly greater basal area for at least
four decades (Fig. 4). After 100 years, total basal area was very
similar under all treatment and regeneration combinations.Trees
in untreated areas were larger on average immediately post-fire
due to greater mortality of small trees compared to treated areas,
but because of more regeneration in untreated areas, average
tree diameter soon dropped below that of treated areas (Fig. 4).
As with tree density, this difference lessened over time and,
by the end of the simulation, treated and untreated areas were
nearly the same, with a slightly larger average diameter under
Regen-1.
In both treated and untreated areas, an open forest with some
surviving ponderosa pines and a few survivors of other species
quickly gave way to a thicket of oaks, junipers, and New Mexico
locust, with the occasional remnant ponderosa pine (Fig. 5) mak-
ing up only around 5% of total density under Regen-1 and 10%
under Regen-2. In treated areas, about a quarter of the trees were
ponderosa pines after the 2004 regeneration became established,
and this proportion remained stable over time; treated areas also
had many more ponderosa pines than untreated areas in absolute
numbers. Two of the seven untreated sites had only 21 and 26
ponderosa pines ha−1 by the end under Regen-1. The relative
density of New Mexico locust declined slowly, from 15 to 30%
at its maximum, to 10–18% after 100 years, while the proportion
of oaks increased slightly over time. About half the trees were
oaks in untreated areas, and 35% in treated areas.The proportion
of junipers was roughly the same in all treatment and regenera-
tion combinations – around 25% – and remained steady over the
course of the simulation.
Basal area differences between treated and untreated areas
became greater over time with little difference between the
regeneration scenarios (Fig. 5). Ponderosa pine initially made
up all the basal area in untreated areas, but after four decades,
treated areas had proportionally more ponderosa pine.After 100
years, treated areas were ∼60% ponderosa pine, while untreated
areas were down to 35%. Oak basal area was largely responsible
for the similarity in total basal area between treated and untreated
areas by the end of the simulation. In treated areas, oaks origi-
nally constituted about 5% and never went beyond 20% of total
basal area, whereas in untreated areas they comprised 40% of
the basal area after 100 years.
Discussion
Despite displaying some of the most intense fire behaviour and
covering the largest severely burned landscape ever observed
in the South-west, the Rodeo–Chediski fire still decreased in

severity in areas that underwent fuel reduction treatments before
the fire.Treated areas were significantly different from untreated
areas in terms of forest structure and some attributes of initial
post-fire recovery. We expect future forest development to differ
as well, especially in terms of dominance by ponderosa pine.
Sampling 2 years post-wildfire allowed us to estimate future
forest development from a relatively accurate starting point.
McHugh and Kolb (2003) ascertained that most mortality after
wildfire in northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests occurs
within the first 2 years, so our measurements of survival should
be reliable. Regeneration had become well established after the
passage of two growing seasons, so our projections of future
growth are based on more complete data than could be gathered
very soon after the fire.
The disadvantage to deferring post-fire sampling is that fire-
killed trees may fall. Because we used variable-radius plots,
which are not suited to measuring fallen trees, we do not have
a complete sample of trees that had already fallen after being
killed by the fire. However, we rarely encountered already-fallen
trees in the study area and most fire-killed ponderosa pine stand
≥3 years (Chambers and Mast 2005), so we believe our estimates
of pre-fire density to be reasonably accurate.
Pre-wildﬁre treatment effects
Treated areas experienced significantly less bole char and
reduced tree mortality than untreated areas.This is in accordance
with previous studies indicating the effectiveness of fuel reduc-
tion treatments or prescribed burning alone at reducing wildfire
severity (Pollet and Omi 2002; Cram and Baker 2003; Martin-
son and Omi 2003; Finney et al. 2005). Overstorey survival was
significantlygreater:halfthetreesintreatedareassurvived,com-
pared to 5% in untreated areas. After the fire, there were more
live trees in terms of density and basal area in treated areas, and
the diameter distribution did not substantially change in shape.
Some portions of treated as well as untreated areas still expe-
rienced complete overstorey mortality, but this was limited to
11% of treated plots as opposed to 66% of untreated plots. The
fire raised crown base height in untreated areas, but not in most
portions of treated areas. While our statistical tests did not indi-
cate that pre-fire forest structure on treated and untreated sites
was significantly different, average overall tree density and den-
sity of small trees on untreated sites was considerably greater
than on treated sites. When compared to the treatments tested by
Pollet and Omi (2002), our ratio of average densities in pre-fire
forest structure between treated and untreated areas was within
the range of treatments they also found effective, albeit on the
low end. Our untreated sites averaged 1.7 times denser than our
treated sites; the untreated sites they studied had between 1.4 and
8.7 times more trees than their treated sites. Pre-fire basal area
was nearly identical on our treated and untreated sites, which Pol-
let and Omi (2002) also found to be the case on two of the four
wildfires they sampled. These findings suggest that fire severity
is coupled more closely to the arrangement of tree fuels – dis-
tributed among many smaller trees v. fewer, larger ones – than
to the total amount of tree fuels.
Future forest development

it very different from the ponderosa pine-dominated overstorey.
Our modelling results indicate that treated areas are likely to
be less dense, have larger trees on average, and have greater
basal area than untreated areas for the next several decades.
Both treated and untreated sites became a thicket of young oaks,
junipers, and New Mexico locust, with both remnant and young
ponderosa pines more common on treated sites but still not
comprising more than a quarter of all trees. By 100 years post-
fire, stands were projected to reach high levels of density and
basal area. These results may not materialise due to uncertain-
ties in the model algorithms, as well as the differences between
modelled and actual climate during the next century, discussed
further below, but the upper limits of tree densities and basal area
do not exceed levels observed in some contemporary Arizona
ponderosa pine forests (Covington et al. 1997; Fulé et al. 2001).
Despite the lack of a significant difference in overall regen-
eration between treated and untreated sites as measured in 2004,
the slightly greater regeneration levels on untreated sites led to
their greater tree density over the course of the simulation, espe-
cially under the second regeneration scenario. Ponderosa pines
still constituted the majority of basal area in treated areas after
100 years, but accounted for only 35% of total basal area in
untreated areas. The proportion of oaks in terms of both density
and basal area increased over time in treated and untreated areas.

The high variability in model outputs, illustrated in the error bars
in Fig. 4, might be expressed in terms of a patchy landscape with
pine groups scattered in a matrix of shrubfields.
Savage and Mast (2005) delineated several trajectories
ponderosa pine forests have taken after crownfire: burned
landscapes have turned back into dense pine forests, become
early-successionalponderosapine/Gambeloakforests,orunder-
gone type conversions into potentially self-perpetuating grass-
lands or oak/manzanita shrubfields. Since some regeneration
was present on every site and 86% of the plots, conversion to
grassland is unlikely. Sixty-four percent of untreated and 11%
of treated plots had no surviving pines and no ponderosa pine
regeneration; conversion to an oak/manzanita shrubfield is more
likely in these areas. In both treated and untreated areas, future
growth will in general be a combination of oaks, junipers, pines,
and New Mexico locust, rather than the strongly ponderosa
pine-dominated pre-wildfire forest.
It is uncertain how long an altered successional trajectory
such as an oak/manzanita shrubfield may persist, and what stage
might occur next (Barton 2002). Savage and Mast (2005) found
that these conditions could persist for at least five decades, and
pointed out that these type conversions may be self-perpetuating
if the area repeatedly experiences intense fire. Tree planting can
substitute for natural regeneration, but Savage and Mast (2005)
cautioned that many post-wildfire plantations of ponderosa pines
have failed. On the other hand, a shrubfield near an area with
surviving pines may eventually revert to a ponderosa pine forest
(Savage and Mast 2005). Our plots with complete mortality of
ponderosa pine trees and no ponderosa pine regeneration (38%
of the plots overall) were patchily distributed across the study
sites, so nearby trees could serve as seed sources. However, even
if these areas ultimately become ponderosa pine forests again,
the recovery process would most likely take centuries rather than
decades. During the interim, ponderosa pine forests on the burn
area would be fragmented and considerably reduced in total size.
Climate change is projected to accelerate shifts in veg-
etational states caused by fire. While site-specific forecasts
remain uncertain, average temperature and precipitation are both
expected to increase in the western USA and Canada, extending
the fire season and increasing both fire frequency and total area
burned because of the greater amplitude and duration of extreme
fire weather (Flannigan et al. 2001;Westerling et al. 2006). In the
South-west, the largest fires are associated with a current-year
drought after several years of above-average precipitation (Swet-
nam and Betancourt 1990; McKenzie et al. 2004), so higher
average precipitation may actually increase the number of large
fires.This effect of climate change on fire regimes may indirectly
hasten vegetation shifts more than the direct effect of climate
change itself on vegetation; burn areas offer sites for invasive
species such as Bromus tectorum to colonise, and increased fire
size and frequency may decrease the habitat available to late-
successional species (Flannigan et al. 2001; McKenzie et al.
2004). Old ponderosa pine forests, already rare, may become
further imperilled.
Management implications
The Rodeo–Chediski fire merits attention not only for its promi-
nence in eastern Arizona but also because similar post-fire
landscapes are likely to dominate increasingly larger fractions
of the South-west’s forests. The unintended long-term effect of
our history of fire suppression, overgrazing, and conventional
timber management focussing on the harvesting of large trees
may be the increasing fragmentation of the largest contigu-
ous ponderosa pine forest in the United States, with resultant
long-term soil damage, loss of timber revenue, and ecological
and social effects that are not yet entirely known. Climate change
is forecasted to accelerate these shifts.
Even under the extreme conditions of drought and wind
that characterised the Rodeo–Chediski, however, fuel reduc-
tion treatments that took place before the fire had a major
effect in reducing fire severity and helping perpetuate ponderosa
pine ecosystems. These treatments included prescribed burning
(Finney et al. 2005) and thinning (Cram and Baker 2003; this
study). These treatments comprised only a small portion of the
burn area, however (Finney et al. 2005).
Field data and simulation results indicate that ponderosa pine
will lose dominance for the next several decades to centuries
over a considerable proportion of the burn area, to be replaced
by a matrix of oak/manzanita shrubfields and thickets of oaks,
junipers, and New Mexico locust with the occasional remnant
ponderosa pine. In contrast, most treated areas should recover
to a ponderosa pine/Gambel oak forest relatively quickly. While
tree planting is costly and often fails in the South-west, it should
be considered because of sparse ponderosa pine regeneration
and the likelihood of shrub species dominance, especially in
untreated areas.
Most south-western forests are currently at high risk of severe
crownfire (Fiedler et al. 2002; Schmidt et al. 2002). Unless
extensive fuel reduction treatments are undertaken in the near
future, preferably in ways that integrate strategic fuelbreak loca-
tions (Finney 2001) and conservation priorities (Noss et al.
2006), many of these forests will experience severe fires. In
1951, Weaver recommended thinning of small-diameter trees
and the use of prescribed fire to improve forest health and pre-
vent severe wildfire in ponderosa pine forests (Weaver 1951).
Forest management involving fuel reduction treatments in an
ecological restoration context are now also recommended by
many others (Covington et al. 1997; Agee and Skinner 2005).
At least in strategic areas, treatments such as thinning and pre-
scribed burning should help ponderosa pine forests persist even
after extraordinary fires, such as the Rodeo–Chediski.
