New White Paper: Forest Fires Have Increased in Size,
Severity and Frequency Across Western Forests
 
As we enter another active wildﬁre season in the Southwest, a new white
paper by the Ecological Restoration Institute analyzes wildﬁre trends across the
western US since 1950. The paper summarizes the conclusions of a
preponderance of literature analyzing changes to wildﬁre season across the
western US and shows that forest ﬁres have increased in size, severity and
frequency. 
 
The paper responds to a minority of critics who maintain that changes in ﬁre
size, frequency and severity are consistent with historical conditions. It explains
how the increase in the number of wildﬁres and area burned in most forested
regions of the West are a result of dense forests with high fuel loads, rising
temperatures, increased drought, longer ﬁre seasons, below-average winter
precipitation, and earlier spring snowmelt.
 
This paper strikes up another timely discussion on living with wildﬁres, wildﬁre
prevention and the implications of large-scale restoration efforts.
