Introduction 
 
Context:  Wildfire is a natural event within the southwestern ponderosa pine forest.  
Its very occurrence is a necessary ingredient to a healthy ecosystem.   However, 
historic fires were predominantly frequent surface fires of low intensity that thinned the 
forest of fuel accumulations, with occasional intense stand replacement fires occurring 
in patchy areas or under extreme fire conditions.  Due to past societal demands and 
land-management practices, natural fuel accumulations have been increasing for 
decades, resulting in an escalating trend in uncharacteristic, dangerous, destructive, 
and costly wildfires.  
 
When a forest is “healthy” it would support low intensity, ground fires every 2-20 years 
across the landscape.  Every year hundreds of thousands of acres of surface fuels 
would burn through natural ignitions or ignitions by native (pre-European) peoples.  
Thus, one of the best defenses against “catastrophic crown fires” is to live with and 
adapt to the type of fire that is natural to the system.  As the one of the goals of the 
national fire plan states, a “Community-based approach to wildland fire issues 
combines cost-effective fire preparedness and suppression to protect communities 
and the environment with a proactive approach that recognizes fire as part of a 
healthy, sustainable ecosystem.” 
 
The 1996 fire season in our area clearly focused public attention on the plight of our 
forests and the risk posed by catastrophic wildfire.  The result was an energized 
community committed to action, the founding of the Greater Flagstaff Forests 
Partnership (GFFP), and the increased involvement of the Ponderosa Fire Advisory 
Council (PFAC).  Since that time, continued wildfire activity and on-going education 
and mitigation efforts have resulted in widespread public support of and an 
expectation for forest treatments.  In addition, as we become more effective with our 
treatments, land managers will be able to make greater use of characteristic, low 
intensity fires through prescribed burns, appropriate wildland fires for resource benefit 
and containment of wildland fires as more effective, cost efficient strategies – a true 
measure of living with and adapting to a fire-dependent ecosystem. 
 
Community protection and preparedness is a critical step toward mitigating immediate 
fire hazards and restoring adjacent wildlands.  A combination of fuel management, 
FireWise standards, and appropriate fire-use and/or suppression response across 
ownerships within-and-adjacent to at-risk communities will reduce threats to life and 
property, protect values-at-risk, and create a safe context for the use of fire in 
subsequent forest ecosystem restoration efforts.  This plan outlines actions needed to 
prepare and equip the greater Flagstaff community to live and thrive within our fire-
adapted ponderosa pine forests.

Goal:  To protect Flagstaff and surrounding communities, and associated values and 
infrastructure, from catastrophic wildfire by means of: 
a) An educated and involved public,  
 
 
 
      
b) Implementation of forest treatment projects designed to reduce wildfire 
threat and improve long-term forest health, in a progressive and prioritized 
manner, and 
c) Utilization of FireWise building techniques and principles. 
The Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP), authorized by the Healthy Forests 
Restoration Act of 2003, is a strategic plan as well as an action plan: it provides a broad 
operating framework for all agencies and ownerships – private, city, county, state, and 
federal – within the area, while identifying community protection priorities.  Site specific 
planning and implementation remains the responsibility of each owner/jurisdictional 
agency, acting in concert with the guidelines expressed within this plan.

Fuel management treatments designed to reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfire 
and protect communities incorporate the principles of ecological restoration.  Practices 
designed to reduce excessive numbers of smaller trees, retain large trees, and accept 
natural fire (or apply prescribed fire to mimic the natural event) are key to reducing the 
wildfire threat in our area.  These treatments, along with other practices over a period 
of time, are required to create the conditions necessary for an improvement in overall 
forest ecosystem health. 
 
Partners:  PFAC is a 16 member group of local emergency and prevention fire agencies; 
GFFP is a 27 member group committed to ecological forest restoration and community 
wildfire protection.  Membership for each organization is included in Appendix 1. Both 
groups have partnered to coordinate development of this plan.  Staff of the Coconino 
National Forest (USFS), which is a member of PFAC and operates under a Memorandum 
of Understanding with GFFP, have been consulted throughout this process as well. 
Both PFAC and GFFP, in concert with strong citizen support, have been collaborating for 
years to reduce the risk of wildfire.  Traditionally, PFAC has focused on response to fire 
events and public education designed to lessen the risk, while GFFP has designed forest 
restoration and community protection projects in 10,000-acre blocks around the greater 
Flagstaff area.     
Signed by President Bush in December 2003, the Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HFRA) 
requires development and approval of a CWPP by communities who wish to receive 
priority funding for implementation of forest treatments designed to reduce wildfire risks to 
their respective community. 
The GFFP and PFAC have identified five mutual objectives: though not all are 
specifically referenced or included in the CWPP, they nonetheless influenced plan 
development.  They are: 
 
• Create a healthy and sustainable forest and protect communities by 
implementing forest treatments designed to reduce the threat of catastrophic 
wildfire.

• Engage the public by providing opportunities in both preparedness and 
mitigation efforts. 
• Support efforts to establish effective and sustainable methods to utilize small-
diameter wood and other forest biomass. 
• Promote FireWise building materials and construction techniques, as well as 
creation and maintenance of defensible properties and neighborhoods. 
• Attract necessary funding (appropriations, contracts, donations, grants, etc.) 
to successfully reduce fire threat. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
Both groups take seriously their respective responsibility to resolve the issues we – as a 
greater community – now face.  Together, we are committed to action that will reduce 
wildfire threat across jurisdictions and within our mutual area-of-interest.  
The Northern Arizona University Forest Ecosystem Restoration Analysis (ForestERA) 
project was engaged to provide baseline data and analysis to assess the impacts of 
ponderosa pine restoration and fuel-reduction treatments.  Using the latest available data 
(2001 satellite imagery), spatial analysis tools in an ArcGIS environment were used to:  
• 
Identify areas for management focus, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Provide baseline data on current conditions (vegetation, canopy closure, etc.), 
• 
Design treatment scenarios and test and compare the cumulative effects of 
these modeled treatments on fire behavior, and  
 
 
 
 
• 
Predict fire hazard and behavior across the entire Analysis Area. 
NOTE: Interested parties are invited to visit the ForestERA website   
 
 
       (www.forestera.nau.edu) for a more detailed discussion of   
 
 
       available data and their modeling process.   
It is recognized this is a “coarse-filter” approach restricted to ponderosa pine forest 
ecosystems that does not exactly match what various agencies would utilize to plan 
and implement site-specific treatments.  Therefore, information presented throughout 
this plan can and should be augmented by the Jurisdiction-Having-Authority (JHA) 
with site-specific data during project planning efforts.  This may result in adjustments 
of priorities, locations, and treatments.   
 
 
The inclusion, application and analysis of ForestERA data is intended to provide a 
framework for discussion and illustrate both the threat and potential impacts of a range 
of treatments that could be applied throughout both the Wildland/Urban Interface zone 
and the entire Analysis Area.   
 
Principles:  Development of the CWPP has been guided by the following framework:  
• 
Fuel Management:  Reduction of target hazardous fuels is based upon known 
fire risk, fire behavior, and threats to values-at-risk.  
 
 
 
 
• 
Social and Political. Social and political concerns play a major part in defining 
treatments and their locations.

O c t o b e r  1 ,  2 0 0 4  

• 
Operational:  Due to financial, infrastructure, and personnel constraints, 
emphasis must placed on strategically located fuel treatments designed to 
protect key values-at-risk, and that can serve as anchor points for larger, 
landscape-scale treatments.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Ecosystem:  Reduction of hazardous fuels should be integrated with overall 
ecosystem conservation, restoration and management goals. 
 
 
 
• 
Economic: Implementation and maintenance of fuel treatment benefits greatly 
outweigh their costs -  
¾ They save money by avoiding suppression expenditures, rehabilitation 
costs, and compensation for property damage 
¾ They are an investment in protecting firefighter and civilian lives 
 
¾ They present new opportunities for rural economic development 
¾ They may help address issues related to the availability of homeowner’s 
insurance in fire prone forest ecosystems 
• 
Ethical: The continuing decline in forest health and the increasing probability of 
catastrophic fires, and their potential impact on the greater Flagstaff region, is a 
reality. The need to act now to restore forest health and reverse this dangerous 
downward spiral is of utmost importance.                         
In addition, the Arizona Governor’s Forest Health Advisory Council developed a set of 
“Guiding Principles for Forest Restoration and Community Protection” through 
collaboration by a wide variety of forest professionals to help communities think 
through how to articulate a plan of action for restoring their forests, and for protecting 
their communities.  Those Principles are included as Appendix 2 and were used 
during development of this plan and in the design of actions to achieve our goal. 
Process:  Development of the CWPP incorporated the eight steps outlined in 
“Preparing a Community Wildfire Protection Plan: A Handbook for Wildland-Urban 
Interface Communities” (March 2004).  These steps are: 
• Step One: Convene decision makers 
• Step Two: Involve federal agencies 
• Step Three: Engage interested parties 
• Step Four: Establish a community base map 
• Step Five: Develop a community risk assessment 
• Step Six: Establish community hazard reduction priorities and recommendations to 
reduce structural ignitability 
• Step Seven: Develop an action plan and assessment strategy 
• Step Eight: Finalize the Community Wildfire Protection Plan 
In addition, we endeavored to reflect the standard themes of any emergency plan – 
Prevention, Mitigation, Response, and Recovery – where appropriate in the plan.

8) Finally, the CWPP: 
(a) 
Received Concurrence by the GFFP, PFAC, the Coconino National 
Forest and the National Park Service 
 
 
 
  
(b) 
Was Approved by the Coconino County Board of Supervisors, Flagstaff 
City Council, local Fire Departments and Fire Districts, and the AZ State 
Land Department – Fire Management Division 
 
 
 
 
Coordination occurred with both the Kaibab National Forest and the Williams Interagency 
Fire Advisory Council regarding areas both west and northwest of this CWPP area, and 
will continue as they work toward development of a CWPP in their area.  Other adjacent 
areas, such as the Blue Ridge area, will be monitored and coordination will occur as they 
begin development of CWPPs or are added to this plan by amendment.  In addition, the 
CWPP for Flagstaff and surrounding communities will be reviewed in six months and then 
annually by a CWPP Review Team consisting of representatives of PFAC, GFFP, the 
USFS, local governments, environmental groups and citizens.  If substantive changes are 
required, it will be submitted to the appropriate authorities for review and approval.    
Relationship To Other Plans:  In March 2000, the then Grand Canyon Forests 
Partnership (GCFP), later renamed the GFFP, in partnership with PFAC, developed a 
“Flagstaff Area Wildfire Risk Assessment” report.  That report detailed wildfire risk in the 
greater Flagstaff area generally based upon a ½-1 mile set-distance from selected 
communities within the boundaries of the GCFP.  This CWPP supercedes that earlier 
document: we have expanded the analysis area, incorporated additional communities, and 
utilized data not available at the time of the earlier report to develop a more realistic picture 
of both threat and need. 
This plan is compatible with and inclusive of on-going planning and implementation efforts 
of various agencies and jurisdictions engaged in its development.  In addition, this plan is 
designed to compliment both existing and developing emergency/disaster management 
plans and Homeland Security related efforts. 
For More Information:  This plan is posted on the GFFP website at www.gffp.org.

Community Identification and Description 
 
Analysis Area:  Map 1 depicts Flagstaff and surrounding communities at-risk included in 
the CWPP Analysis Area.   The Analysis Area includes portions of two counties (primarily 
Coconino, with a very small part of Yavapai), two cities and their associated adjacent 
areas (Flagstaff and Sedona), several unincorporated communities (Munds Park, Mormon 
Lake, Parks/Bellemont, Cosnino/Winona), the greater Flagstaff Metropolitan Planning 
Organization area (joint County-City of Flagstaff planning effort), two National Forests 
(primarily the Coconino, with a small part of the Kaibab), and the Flagstaff-area National 
Monuments. 
Map 2 depicts ownership within the plan boundary.  Acreage breakouts for the Analysis 
Area are shown below:

The roughly 1,465-square mile Analysis Area stretches from the San Francisco Peaks 
to below the Mogollon Rim, and is in the midst of the largest continuous ponderosa 
pine forest in the world.  The full-time population of the area is approximately 75,000, 
with another 20,000+/- visitors in the area on any given day.

In addition, the plan encompasses an area that includes two Interstate Highways (I-17 
and I-40), two Arizona Department of Transportation designated scenic byways (Hwy 
89A and Hwy 180), a major east-west railroad line (Burlington Northern Santa Fe), a 
regional airport, a state University and community college, two world-class 
observatories (three sites), numerous cultural attractions, archaeological treasures, 
and recreational sites, three critical community watersheds (Flagstaff – Rio de Flag 
and Lake Mary; Sedona – Oak Creek), and the San Francisco Peaks, the highest 
mountains in Arizona and a backdrop for the area recognized as a significant site for 
several Native American tribes.  
 
Headquarters of the Coconino National Forest, the area also serves as the gateway to 
Grand Canyon National Park.  Finally the area is bounded on the west by Camp 
Navajo, a weapons storage site and AZ Army National Guard training facility, and on 
the northeast and east by the Flagstaff Area National Monuments (Wupatki, Sunset 
Crater, and Walnut Canyon).   
 
To facilitate establishment of the Wildland/Urban Interface, a Threat Matrix utilizing 
ForestERA data for the entire Analysis Area was developed.  Multiple parameters were 
examined both separately and in combination with others.  Those selected to include in 
the final analysis were as follows: 
                                                        Table 2

2. Municipal Watersheds (Lake Mary) 
RISK 
3. Fire Behavior (Predicted active and passive crown fire, surface fire)        
4. Post-Fire Flooding Potential (Rio de Flag and Oak Creek) 
OTHER 
5. Areas upwind (six-mile distance) from at-risk communities 
 
Items which influenced the selection of these five parameters included: 
1. Homes and businesses are the basis of the CWPP.  We chose a minimum “buffer” 
value of a 1½ miles around at-risk communities.  (Infrastructure was considered 
separately – see p. 21) 
2. The Lake Mary watershed provides approximately 30% of the water supply for the 
Flagstaff area (since 1949). 
3. Predicted fire behavior (Table 3 and Map 3) can be modeled based upon vegetation, 
slope, weather and other factors.  
4. Both the Rio de Flag and Oak Creek have a high potential for flooding (with 
associated erosion and sedimentation) following a severe wildfire, with significant 
impacts to Flagstaff and Sedona, respectively.  
5. Large fires are typically associated with wind events: it is not uncommon for long-
distance spread of several miles to occur in a relatively short period (4-6 hours).

As depicted in Tables 4 and 5, and Map 4, the Threat Level was divided into three 
categories: High, Moderate, and Low.  Three important items to understand in reviewing 
this Map are: 
1. 
Based upon this analysis, an indication of High Threat did not appear around the 
communities of Parks or Mormon Lake.  However, a ground assessment of the 
site reveals that a High Threat does indeed exist.  (This reinforces the concept 
that the ForestERA approach requires site-specific evaluation prior to 
implementation of any recommended treatment.)  To ensure inclusion of 
protection for all communities, a 1½ mile buffer on the upwind side of 
communities and a ½ mile buffer on the downwind side was included.  
2. 
Oak Creek Canyon is a “corridor” which links the Sedona area with both the 
Munds Park and greater Flagstaff areas.  Topography and other resource issues 
may restrict the ability to conduct large-scale treatments in this corridor, but 
reinforces the need to implement effective FireWise building standards on private 
property, and to conduct treatments downwind, where fire will exit the canyon and 
threaten either Munds Park or Flagstaff. 
3. 
This analysis is based upon a landscape-scale study: threats to some areas 
(Sedona, Winona, City of Flagstaff) are not clearly depicted but all threat levels 
are known to exist.  Site-specific interpretation is required by local experts, 
owners, and jurisdictional agencies.   
Appendix 2 contains a complete set of the five separate maps listed above (Values, 
Risk, Other) that were utilized to conduct this analysis.

Wildland/Urban Interface:  The Wildland/Urban Interface for Flagstaff and surrounding 
communities at-risk encompasses multiple jurisdictions and ownerships within a relatively 
large geographical area.  It extends for some distance outside the City of Flagstaff 
corporate boundaries, the largest metropolitan community in Northern Arizona.  Areas 
within unincorporated Coconino County include the communities of Munds Park, Kachina 
Village, Mountainaire, Forest Highlands, Mormon Lake, Bellemont, Timberline-Fernwood, 
Doney Park, Lower Lake Mary, Flagstaff Ranch, the Baderville-Ft. Valley, Mt Elden, 
Westwood, and Pine Dell Fire Districts (contract entities served by the Flagstaff Fire 
Department), Cosnino, Winona, Upper Oak Creek Canyon, and Sedona, as well as 
substantial state and federal land.  Overall, this plan incorporates these at-risk 
communities and their associated infrastructure sites into a single regional CWPP, rather 
than separate plans for each. 
The “interface” is often defined as an easily identified geographic area where structures 
directly abut wildland fuels.  In this perspective, the “interface” is confined to a relatively 
narrow area a set-distance from neighborhoods or communities.  Some view it strictly as 
the “Home Ignition Zone”, a distance of roughly 100-200 ft. from a structure.  Others view it 
in a somewhat larger context: the Healthy Forests Restoration Act (HFRA) identifies it, in 
the absence of a CWPP, as a distance of ½ mile or 1½ mile from an at-risk community, 
depending on local conditions.

Limiting treatments to a pre-set distance from structures, while important to individual 
structure and/or infrastructure protection, does not recognize that a community is more 
than a collection of structures, and fails to understand the dynamic nature of fire behavior.  
Further, a strict distance definition does not adequately address the ecological needs of an 
area.   
The Wildland/Urban Interface for Flagstaff and surrounding communities, as allowed by 
the HFRA, is identified as an area where public safety is the over-riding goal: it is 
sufficiently large to: 
1) 
Reduce the potential of a high intensity fire from entering the community, 
2) 
Create an area whereby fire suppression efforts will be successful,                   
3) 
Limit large amounts of wind-driven embers or “fire brands” from settling on the 
community, and                        
4) 
Protect critical infrastructure. 
Infrastructure outside of identified at-risk communities was also incorporated into the 
Wildland/Urban Interface zone.  We chose to buffer infrastructure, such as is listed below, 
by a ¼ mile treatment zone (1/8 mile either side): 
 NOPI Research Facility – Anderson Mesa  
 Utilities:   
High voltage overhead powerlines  
 
 
 
     
El Paso Natural Gas aboveground stations 
 
 
 Transportation 
Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad 
 
 
 
 
Interstate 17 and 40  
 
 
 
 
 
 
State Highways 3, 89A, and 180  
 
 
 
 Communication: 
Cell Phone Towers   
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mt. Elden Tower Sites  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mormon Mountain Tower Sites 
 
 
 
 
 
Schnebly Hill Tower Sites 
In addition, ForestERA data does not exist for the Sedona and Cosnino/Winona areas.  
We have therefore chosen to include a 1½ mile buffer on the upwind side of each 
community and a ½ mile buffer on the downwind side. 
When the Threat Map (Map 4, p.18) and community and infrastructure buffers were 
combined, the Wildland/Urban Interface for this CWPP was established as depicted on 
Map 5, with acreage breakouts shown in Table 6.

We recognize that several smaller clusters of homes exist outside the identified at-risk 
communities and designated Wildland/Urban Interface zone but within the overall Analysis 
Area.  Their exclusion in no way diminishes the need for those owners to undertake 
appropriate mitigation efforts or cooperative ventures between themselves and the 
adjacent landowner and/or jurisdictional authority.   However, to include every parcel of 
private land within the Wildland/Urban Interface is to enlarge it beyond realistic treatment 
capabilities.

Community Assessment 
 
Fuel Hazard:  Prior to European settlement in the 1860’s, the forest around Flagstaff was 
comprised of relatively open stands of large-diameter ponderosa pine with scattered oaks, 
aspen, and other species, and intermingled with denser forests in canyons and on steep 
slopes, and with open meadows and grasslands common.   Tree numbers averaged 30-50 
per acre, with these trees arranged in small groups.  While some young thickets and open 
meadows were undoubtedly present, a savanna community structure dominated the 
landscape.  Fires were frequent, returning every 2-7 years, and were relatively low-intensity 
in nature. 
Beginning in the 1880’s, and extending until fairly recently, area forests were subjected to societal 
demands that resulted in intense livestock grazing, harvesting of large-diameter trees, and a 
policy of fire suppression that embraced fire exclusion.  These actions led to profound changes 
within the forest and set-the-stage for the intense wildfires common today. 
From 1917-1920, a period of relatively wet weather, in combination with the exceptional 1919 
cone crop, resulted in the establishment of millions of new seedlings.  These trees are the very

As a result, many pine stands are presently overstocked with small and mid-sized second-growth 
trees.  Basal areas commonly range from 150 to well over 200 and tree density from several 
hundred to over a thousand per acre.  Canopy closure typically varies from 50% to 70% but often 
approaches 100%.   An occasional juniper, pinyon pine, Douglas fir, white fir, Gambel oak, limber 
pine or aspen occurs among the pine stands.  Insect and disease problems in these stands 
include dwarf mistletoe and periodic episodes of various bark beetles and other insects and 
disease.   
Ponderosa pine sites, the overwhelming majority of the entire area, are best represented by Fire 
Behavior Prediction System (FBPS) Fuel Model #9 - closed-canopy pine stand with needle 
understory.  In the few open areas, ground cover is a mix of grasses and forbs.  Logging residue 
from the early 1900’s such as pitchy high stumps and remaining cull trees contribute to the fire 
hazard and fuel laddering potential.  
Fires are natural events, have been present since before humans occupied this area, and 
will continue to occur.  What has changed, however, is the severity of fires we now 
experience.  Our ponderosa pine ecosystem did not evolve with the fire intensity of today’s 
fires, whether natural or human caused.   
Three factors influence the spread of wildfire: fuel, weather, and topography.  Of these, we 
can only manage fuel to reduce the intensity and spread of wildfire.  
Fuel – The area around Flagstaff is part of the largest continuous ponderosa pine 
forest in the world. Natural fuel amounts have increased dramatically in the past 80 
years.  Homes and flameable structures are simply another source of fuel. 
 
Weather – Historically, due to prevailing wind pattern, our local fire spread pattern 
is from the southwest to northeast.  We also experience two other fire weather 
factors on a fairly routine basis that, like wind, are beyond our ability to control: low 
relative humidity and high temperature.  The southwest is also in the midst of a 
persistent drought that has greatly increased vegetation mortality, thus increasing 
fire potential.  
 
Topography -- Fires burn faster upslope than down.  Canyons, ridges, and 
drainages funnel wind.  South facing slopes dry quicker and burn more readily.  
Steep slopes present challenges for treating hazardous fuels, thus reinforcing the 
need to treat adjacent, more easily accessible areas, in a more intensive manner 
and at a greater scale. 
 
Wildfires teach valuable lessons: 
 
1. 
They occur in any season of the year. Although the primary concern (both in 
number and severity) is during the Apr-July timeframe, fire agencies in the 
area respond to wildfires virtually year-round when appropriate weather 
conditions exist. 
 
2. 
They can be any size.  Both small and large fires can be destructive.

O c t o b e r  1 ,  2 0 0 4  
2 7

3. 
They occur in any fuel type.  Timber fires have the biggest flames, and offer 
the most resistance to control, but grass fires can be just as frightening to 
residents, and result in significant damage/loss to homes and infrastructure. 
 
4. 
They can burn with incredible speed.  Most damage within developed areas 
occurs within a relatively short timeframe.  Once a wildfire encroaches upon a 
community, it is too late to implement widespread, highly effective mitigation 
measures. 
 
5. 
Generally, there are seldom enough resources to protect every home, 
structure, or improvement during a large, catastrophic wildfire.   Emergency 
responders are often forced to decide which homes to protect and which to 
abandon.  Mitigation actions recommended and/or required and implemented 
now will make a tremendous difference in the survival of homes and property 
and the protection of community values-at-risk. 
 
6. 
The trend in wildfire size and intensity, coupled with increasing awareness of 
other values-at-risk, is resulting in growing pressure to place firefighters in 
areas of greater-and-greater risk.  Firefighter and public safety are the 
absolute first priority, but it is not uncommon for fire managers to find 
themselves at-odds with non-fire personnel who insist on dangerous and 
unsafe actions of questionable value.  Responsible fire managers understand 
that permitting such actions violates their first priority and are obliged to 
refuse. 
 
7. 
Wildfires do not respect boundaries or jurisdictions, and they have become 
increasingly destructive and expensive.  A multi-agency, inter-departmental, 
and multi-faceted program approach is necessary to reduce risk prior to 
ignition; suppression actions alone are not the answer. 
 
8. 
The question is not “if” a wildfire will occur, it is “when” and “where” it will 
happen. 
                                                                                                                                                           
To achieve community protection, forest treatments and FireWise standards focused on 
public safety must begin in the Wildland/Urban Interface.  First priority should be given to 
treating areas of dangerous fuels adjacent to communities, and then working outward in 
the W/UI. The overall scope-of-work is immense and the need to act quickly and decisively 
in this priority area is paramount.  For community benefit, treatments in the Analysis Area 
focused on ecological needs and forest health, but reflecting the need to reduce fire threat, 
should also occur.    
Important community protection and forest health restoration work has been 
implemented throughout the Analysis Area during the past several years, and plans 
are underway to continue treatments.  As one example, treatments completed in-and-
around the City of Flagstaff as of July 2004 are depicted in Map 8, which was 
compiled by the Flagstaff Fire Department.

Community Values At Risk:  The greater Flagstaff area is dependent upon a healthy 
forest for community well being.  Catastrophic wildfire, fed by excessive fuel amounts, 
on-going drought, and devastating insect attacks, threaten a myriad of community 
values.  These values may include scenic vistas, emotional and spiritual attachments, 
cultural resources, watershed values, wildlife habitat, old-growth forests, recreational 
opportunities, public health, firefighter safety, structures and other infrastructure, and 
public confidence in government.   (A description of these can be found in the article 
“The Wildland Urban Interface: What’s Really At Risk?” at the following web site: 
www.flagstaff.az.gov/fuelmanagement.)  
 
Two other community impacts not commonly considered include the following: 
1)   The economic shock of catastrophic fires to a local economy is an important,  
  
and often overlooked impact.   A recent study conducted by the Flagstaff Fire  
  
Department, with information supplied by the Greater Flagstaff Economic  
  
Council, the Chamber of Commerce, and the City’s Sales Tax Division, and 
  
utilizing information from other communities affected by large fires, revealed  
  
that a fire which damaged and/or destroyed 300 homes in early summer – at  
  
the onset of the tourist and visitor season – would have a first-year economic  
  
impact to the greater community in excess of $60 million.   
2) The Rodeo-Chediski fire (2002) was the largest wildfire in Arizona’s recorded 
history and was visible from Flagstaff.  Even though it was more than 80 miles 
away, it prompted tremendous public concern as evidenced by the large increase 
and tone of calls into the Flagstaff 911 Emergency Dispatch Center.  By 
overlaying the boundary and footprint of that 460,000 fire on Flagstaff and the 
northern area of the CWPP (Map 10), we get a dramatic illustration of the 
extensive impacts a large fire like this might have on our area – communities from 
Doney Park to Williams devastated, wildlife habitat and critical watersheds 
stripped of their vegetative cover, decades to rebuild lives and centuries for 
ecosystem restoration.  The scope of values that could be impacted is truly 
significant and just the potential for that type of wildifre occurrence is a primary 
driving force for creation of this CWPP - to ameliorate the threat of such a fire to 
the Flagstaff and surrounding communities.

Community Mitigation Plan 
 
Fuel Hazard Reduction:  As indicated in the Introduction section, the CWPP is both a 
strategic plan and action plan: it provides a broad operating framework for all agencies 
and ownerships – private, city, county, state, and federal – within the area and 
identifies priority areas and treatments.  Specific site prescription planning and 
implementation is the responsibility of each JHA, acting in consideration of the 
guidelines expressed within this plan.                                                                                                  
 
Mitigation actions designed to reduce dangerous fuel accumulations within the 
Analysis Area are based, in part, on the “Guiding Principles for Forest Ecosystem 
Restoration and Community Protection” promulgated by the Governor’s Arizona 
Forest Health Advisory Council (Appendix 2).  These principles include: 
 
1. The overall strategy is dynamic, adaptive, and coordinated.  Given the current 
continuing decline in forest health, and the increasing threat of catastrophic 
wildfire, our actions to reverse this trend must be bold, large-scale, and 
undertaken immediately.  All actions must be considered against the certain 
results of inaction, and must be continually monitored and revised as 
necessary. 
 
2. A sustainable community, with associated values-at-risk, is linked to a 
sustainable ecosystem.  Appropriate treatments must be based on social and 
ecological needs, and be geared toward reducing risk of destructive wildfire 
and restoring functioning ecosystems.  Restoration efforts should be directed 
toward protecting and promoting development of old-growth and large trees, 
but not – if such a case should exist – at the expense of adequate fire 
protection to communities at-risk.   Fire hazard reduction must be linked to the 
reintroduction of fire as a keystone ecological process.  An active program of 
prescribed fire, including maintenance burns, and natural fire use, with 
implementation by land-managers on a site-specific need and basis, is 
essential.  Vegetative treatments, and the pace of their implementation, will 
vary across the landscape, thereby creating an opportunity for biodiversity to 
exist and flourish.   
 
3. The immediate, but not exclusive, focus is on protecting communities.  A fire-
resistive condition will be accomplished by modifying forest fuels at sufficient 
distances from structures and communities so as to reduce severe fire 
behavior, establishing defensible neighborhoods, and widespread use of fire 
resistant construction materials and architectural design.

O c t o b e r  1 ,  2 0 0 4

4. Necessary treatments, both-first entry efforts and maintenance activities, 
implemented and continued on site-specific needs, require a sustained 
commitment of public interest, political will, and financial investment.  
Reducing wildfire risk and improving forest health is a long-term process 
measured in decades: because we are dealing with a living and dying 
ecosystem, it is one that will essentially be required forever. 
 
Desired Future Conditions:  Actions and treatments will leave both the landscape and 
at-risk communities resistant to catastrophic fire.  Ponderosa pine stands will generally 
range from 30-100 larger-diameter trees/acre and/or basal area of 40-80/acre, be 
found in groups in varying degrees of interlocking canopy, and be separated by 
openings of various sizes.  This pattern of tree clumps and openings will be variable 
and provide for a diverse, rich, robust and healthy ecosystem that supports a variety of 
butterflies, songbirds, mycorrhizae, carabib beetles, pollinators, grasses, flowers, 
shrubs and herbaceous plants.  Further, it will avoid a homogenous, plantation 
appearance.  Thicker groupings of trees, including all sizes, are found scattered 
throughout the larger area 
Specific objectives related to fire behavior in ponderosa pine forest ecosystems 
(designed to make suppression actions easier, safer, and less costly, and to facilitate 
prescribed fire use), are as follows:

These principles address only forested ecosystems.  One quarter of the Analysis Area, such as areas 
around Sedona and Cosnino/Winona, is composed of other vegetation types, primarily pinon/juniper 
woodlands and chaparral.  As better data becomes available on fire behavior and treatment effects in 
these vegetation types, this plan will be amended to address fire behavior within these habitats.

Treatment Guidelines:  This plan provides recommendations for successful 
outcomes, and not prescriptive options for treatment of ponderosa pine forests.  
The following discussion is intended to serve as a general guide and framework 
within which specific prescriptions should be developed.  Modification of these 
concepts, by the JHA based upon specific conditions and objectives for that 
specific parcel, existing land management plans, legal requirements, and other 
standards, will be required and is encouraged.   
Tree Selection - Selective thinning from below, initially focusing on over-topped 
pines, is a priority.  If possible, “leave” trees are left in a clumped pattern rather than 
evenly spaced.  Openings created by the clumpy leave-tree pattern allow a fire to 
either drop to the ground or stay on the ground permitting effective suppression 
action. Clumps can vary from 1/10th acre up to as large as 1 or more acres in size.  
The number of trees in a clump may range from as few as two to 15 or more, with 
30 or more occurring in a limited number of clumps throughout specific project 
areas.  Trees, including the crown area, will generally occupy areas ranging from 
20-50% of the area.  Openings will range from 1/10th to 1-2 acres in size and 
constitute a variable of 50-80% of the area.   
In general, trees designated for removal exhibit one-or-more of the following 
characteristics: 
1. 
Contributes to crown-fire behavior: ladder effect into the overstory canopy, low 
crown-base heights, dense interlocking canopies, etc. 
2. 
Are vulnerable to drought or insect infestation: suppressed, reduced vigor, etc. 
3. 
Currently infested with insects that threaten to spread to other trees, unless the 
tree is to remain for other benefits. 
4. 
Infected with dwarf mistletoe: Stands with high infestation levels of dwarf mistletoe 
can be thinned or pruned to reduce crown fire potential during the inevitable 
wildfire.  Small pockets of mistletoe can be Isolated from non-infected trees by a 
barrier of fifty feet (to reduce further spread of the parasite), or removed. 
 
Conversely, trees considered for retention, will be those, unless other issues or 
benefits prevail, which are often: 
 
1. 
Clustered around evidences of historic forest structure (ex: downed logs, 
stumps, stump-pits, etc) or, alternatively, based on best existing forest 
structure.  
2. 
The largest diameter, exhibit high crown-base heights, and are the most 
fire resistant:   
3. 
Old trees exhibiting yellow bark.     
4. 
Oaks, aspen, or other species of wildlife or ecological value 
 
NOTE:  a)  Some variation is needed: trees may vary in-height. Stands should 
include small intermediate size trees, saplings and seedlings, but 
none of these should threaten larger, older trees during a fire.

O c t o b e r  1 ,  2 0 0 4

b)   In the absence of prescribed fire, clumps may be prone to loss due 
to high surface fuel loadings: retention of clumps requires periodic 
use of fire. 
                                                                                                               
Removal of the larger diameter trees in a stand, including standing dead snags, is 
to be avoided unless cutting is required to adequately reduce fire risk, provide for 
public safety or protection of improvements (ex: trees leaning over home, play area, 
power line, road, or hiking trail), or for some other ecological benefit. (Removal of 
“large” trees is a significant issue for many groups and individuals.  The GFFP has 
been discussing this issue for several years and is currently considering adoption of 
“A Management Policy for Ponderosa Pine Forest Structure in the Flagstaff 
Wildland/Urban Interface”.  Such a policy, when adopted, should be incorporated 
into revisions of this CWPP to address this issue.) 
When designating trees for removal, personnel must be aware of fire behavior 
alignments such as prevailing wind direction, shading, slope, fuel arrangement and 
continuity, including interlocking crowns, and potential suppression strategy and 
tactics best-suited to the individual site.    
Wind-driven fires are not uncommon in our area.  To provide optimal protection, 
treatments are required upwind of at-risk communities – south and west in our area 
– to a greater distance to provide adequate protection.  Conversely, treatment 
distance north and east of at-risk communities can be reduced unless 
circumstances dictate otherwise.  However, one should be mindful that plume 
dominated fire behavior results in extreme fire spread from spotting of several miles 
in all directions and should be expected. 
Topographic features – such as canyons – directly influence fire behavior, but may 
be impractical to treat due to slope, soil sensitivity, safety, expense, and other 
values such as critical wildlife habitat.  This lends emphasis to enlarging treatments 
where fire is expected to emerge from a canyon and where firefighting forces have 
the best opportunity for control    
Overall, this approach is considered to be an intermediate-intense modification of 
most existing stands, involving removal of 50-75% of the existing trees.  Experience 
has shown that over the entire area, many, but not all, of the trees to be removed 
will be smaller diameter. 
Cutting Techniques - The type of mechanized operation is obviously important 
when conducting treatments.  A traditional harvesting operation may be the 
preferred method in some areas, while in others it may not.  For the later, a 
“micro” harvesting approach may be required: trees are cut either using hand-
crews with power saws or by a small shear, and wood can be moved by an All-
Terrain-Vehicle (ATV) with a trailer or some other small-equipment approach.  
Such an approach, however, will likely lengthen the time required to treat the 
parcel, and may result in higher costs and pose an increased risk to the 
operator.

Restricting hours of operation in response to local conditions and neighborhood 
concerns may be warranted.  For example, if an operation is immediately adjacent 
to homes or a neighborhood, activity may need to be restricted to normal working 
hours within a reasonable distance to lessen the impact to residents.  However, 
doing so  should be done with the realization the operation will extend further into 
the future. 
Stumps should be cut as low to the ground and as level as possible.  This not only 
improves post-treatment visual quality, but permits easy access for wood removal 
and other subsequent land management needs.  However, potential adverse 
impacts from unrestricted post-treatment access (ex: soil compaction, erosion, etc) 
should be addressed in the planning phase of a project, and subsequently 
managed.  
Utilization - The majority of material available for wood production from the 
greater Flagstaff area will be small diameter ponderosa pine. Opportunities for 
using this material are constrained by a number of factors including high 
harvesting costs, structural properties associated with juvenile wood, and a lack 
of consistent markets and processing facilities.  Harvesting costs associated 
with forest restoration and community wildfire protection, including 
transportation and handling of raw material, are often quite high even where 
larger, high-value trees can be harvested. These costs can be prohibitive for 
smaller businesses. 
 
The difficulty in finding suitable markets for this small diameter material is 
magnified by poor mechanical properties that make it unsuitable for all but the 
least demanding structural uses. It is characterized by suppressed growth with 
low tension and strength due to a high ratio of juvenile wood and difficulty in 
product drying. Finding suitable markets is further complicated by the fact that 
currently there are virtually no outlets for the types of timber that will be 
harvested. New processing facilities will have to match the types of wood 
material available with the use of contemporary utilization techniques. 
 
Northern Arizona and Flagstaff is uniquely situated to capitalize on 
contemporary opportunities for solid wood and biomass utilization. (See 
Appendix 6 for a complete description of this topic.)  Solid wood applications in 
which businesses are actively exploring or have already invested in the 
Flagstaff area, include roundwood construction, composite products like 
oriented strand board (OSB) and wood/plastic materials, and engineered 
lumber like glu-laminate beams and finger-jointed lumber. Biomass applications 
include wood chips for baseload energy production, densified fuel pellets for 
heating, and biochemical extractives. Other products for which small diameter 
pine is currently being used in the region include firewood, posts and poles, 
landscaping timbers, ground covers or mulch, pallet manufacturing, and crafts.

Slash Treatment – Four general slash-disposal methods exist and each may be 
utilized under the appropriate circumstances.  Regardless of the method chosen, 
the required work (such as piling) should be completed as soon as possible after it 
is generated. 
Hand Piles:  This is a common practice of handling slash.  Hand piles 
should be a minimum of six feet tall and six feet wide.  Piles should be 
located in openings to minimize scorching leave trees when the piles are 
later burned.  Likewise, placing piles on top of old stumps or logs should be 
avoided to reduce both the amount of smoke and the chance for “creep” 
when the piles are later burned.   
Machine Piles:  This method is feasible and widely utilized.  It is particularly 
appropriate on larger projects and in more open areas.  Piles are typically much 
larger than those created by hand-piling.  Whole tree skidding may also be used 
with the piles created at the landings.  Windrows may also built using dozers: 
this technique has been successfully utilized in the area.  
Chip or Grind:  Although occasionally used, this technique is comparatively 
expensive and chips decompose slowly in our area.  If future under-burning is 
anticipated for the site, chips may add to smoke management problems.  The 
material can, however, be used for mulch or decorative landscaping.  Hauling 
chips to a disposal site is expensive. 
Lop-and-Scatter:  This method, where material is cut so it is less than 12-24 
inches above ground-level and then left on-site, should be carefully considered 
on sites immediately adjacent to structures.  If the amount of slash is light and 
the manager can complete a broadcast burn as soon as the material has dried, 
it may be effective.  However, due to the increased fire hazard, as well as visual 
concerns, this method is not as common as it once was, and adjacent to 
homes, it should never be left in-place for an extended period.   
Pile Burning - Piles should be burned only when consumption will be greater 
than 90%.  All pile burns should be conducted under conditions intended to 
minimize scorch and smoke impacts. 
Because the ultimate intent for many treatment sites is to conduct a broadcast 
burn, some existing dead-and-downed material can be piled during the thinning 
operation.  These piles could then be burned alongside thinning-material slash 
piles.  Although there are financial costs of doing so, which may be prohibitive 
depending upon the site, removing these materials during the pile burn phase does 
result in decreased smoke emissions during the subsequent broadcast burn.

Hand Piles: As a standard practice, these piles are burned either when snow 
cover exists or during an extended wet weather episode.  Once ignited and as 
they burn-down, the piles can be periodically consolidated to ensure complete 
and timely consumption.  Ignited piles should, if at all possible, burn-down by 
nightfall to minimize smoke impacts to area residents. 
Machine Piles: Like pile burns, this type operation requires either snow or an 
extended wet weather episode.  These type piles typically are larger than hand-
piles, and will therefore burn longer once ignited.  The advantage is that there 
are fewer piles per acre and they can often be burned under wetter conditions 
than possible for hand-pile burning.  
 
Photo 8: Pile burn operation 
Broadcast Burning- Treating ground fuels is a critical component of any effort 
designed to reduce fire threat, and it has added ecological benefits, such as 
recycling nutrients.  Once an area has been thinned and the slash has been 
treated, or where a burn only treatment is designated, the site can be broadcast 
burned.  Firelines are usually constructed by hand or with a drag pulled by an 
ATV, or the burn crew can use natural breaks or roads/trails as a containment 
line. 
Where site objectives dictate that standing dead trees and large downed woody 
material need to be protected, they can be either hand lined or otherwise excluded 
from the burn block.  Extra protection measures may not be necessary for many 
fire-tolerant cultural or archaeological sites: treating these areas with prescribed fire 
has the advantage of protecting them from emergency suppression activities during 
a wildfire.

Photo 9: Broadcast burning can be successfully implanted   
 
         
both in the forest and adjacent to homes 
Deep duff and needle accumulation at the base of the larger older trees will often 
smolder for days.  This essentially bakes the cambium layer and can lead to tree 
death 1-2 years, or more, after the burn.  To avoid this potential loss, the site should 
be evaluated prior to ignition.  If necessary, duff and needle material can be raked-
away from high-risk trees: usually raking to a distance of one foot from the bole is 
sufficient.   
Historically, large-scale broadcast burning has occurred in the fall, and to a lesser 
extent, during breaks in the summer monsoon season.  Within the past few years, 
however, in response to smoke management objectives, burning is also occurring 
in the spring.  As the demands to boost prescribed fire use increase, one option to 
enlarge the burn ”window” is to shift more burns into the spring and summer 
months to recreate the historical fire regime.  This, however, is a more challenging 
time to use prescribed fire and will depend on the availability and preparedness of 
appropriate resources at the local, regional and national levels.  Summer burning 
should become easier, from a fire behavior standpoint, once a site has been 
previously burned and excessive accumulations of fuel are removed. 
Under-burning in pine stands generally calls for target flame lengths of 1 to 3 ft, 
although some sites require a “hotter” burn to achieve resource objectives.   
Ignition by hand with drip torches or with ATV-mounted torches is preferred.  Burn 
operations usually begun by mid-morning following the break-up of the night time 
temperature inversion and the establishment of the day time wind pattern.  
Completion of ignition should be targeted early enough to ensure adequate smoke 
dispersal prior to the onset of cooler nighttime temperatures.

Every burn is to have a completed burn plan.  Among many items in this plan are 
specific objectives for the burn.  These may include, but are not limited to, such 
items as: 
1. 
Fuel Reduction (fuel size classes, %’s, etc)                                  
 
2. 
Tree Mortality  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
          
3.  
Scorch  
 
Extensive public notification is an essential element of the program.  This can be 
achieved by posting signs in the area announcing the proposed burn, news 
releases, and in many cases, door to door contact throughout the nearby 
neighborhood(s).  A continuing education program through talks to civic groups, 
service clubs, and others to inform the community of the importance and benefits of 
the program are important as they generate understanding and support for the 
effort.   
Local experience has shown that a previously notified neighborhood is willing to 
tolerate smoke for a day, but after 2-3 days, patience wears thin.  If a particular log, 
stump, or site within a burn unit becomes a major concern to nearby resident(s), 
the responsible fire manager may decide to extinguish it the first night.   
Burn units should be designed so they can be dispersed throughout the area so as 
to not constantly impact the same neighborhood(s).  Neighborhood air sheds, 
indicated by diurnal smoke flows, are key to managing nighttime smoke impacts.    
Maintenance:  Once thinning, slash treatment, and first under-burning have 
been completed, the treated area constitutes an effective fuel-break for the next 
several years.  Follow-up thinning and maintenance burns must be scheduled 
as necessary to ensure the treated areas remain free of the risk of catastrophic 
wildfire.  Adequate access must be assured, not only to conduct needed follow-
up treatments, but also to permit rapid response of fire suppression forces.  As 
part of a long-term maintenance and fire management program, fire 
containment and wildland fire use should be emphasized as appropriate 
management options for fire restoration. 
Community Involvement - Throughout any treatment operation, the Project 
Manager must maintain contact with potentially affected residents.  Input and 
concerns from such persons must be considered, and where possible, 
incorporated into the overall effort.  Treatments bordering neighborhoods 
should be explained to residents: one approach would be to go door to door to 
each residence, explain the project, and gather first-hand comments.  In 
particular instances, a “case-officer”, assigned to a specific resident, may be 
desired so that one person deals with that individual throughout the life-of-the 
project.

Photo 10: Public involvement is critical to success 
Costs - Individual project expenses vary tremendously from site-to-site based 
on ownership, size, complexity, and need. It is difficult to compare one site to 
another, especially initial treatment vs. maintenance requirements. Table 8 on 
pg. 58 presents “average” costs associated with CWPP treatment 
recommendations in order to establish a ball-park figure of what it may cost to 
achieve the fire behavior modifications described in this plan. 
What should also be considered is the cost of doing nothing.  For our area, it is no 
longer a question of “if” a wildfire will occur, but “when”, “where”, and “how much 
damage” will result.  Working with residents before the wildfire, not during or after it, 
is preferred. 
Benefits – Experience with wildfires burning in previously treated areas 
demonstrates the following:  
 
Improved access for fire fighters and apparatus 
 
Increased efficiency when locating and constructing firelines 
 
Easier detection and suppression of spot fires 
 
Decreased mop up time and effort 
 
Reduced fire intensity, torching and mortality 
 
Improved public safety 
 
Reduction of loss 
 
Reduction of air emissions 
 
Another benefit, particularly in interface areas, is reduced trash accumulation 
through elimination of hiding cover necessary for transient camps and party spots.

Recommendations and Guidelines – Experience with Interface Zone treatments 
has led to development of the following procedures: 
1. 
Involve those potentially impacted or affected from the very beginning.  
 
2.  
Once the project is started, commit to complete it in a timely manner.   
 
3. 
Use signs, news releases, and other appropriate methods to update 
people on the status of the project. 
 
4. 
When mistakes occur, which can and will happen, immediately  notify 
adjacent residents, explain what happened and why, and advise them of 
what is being done to correct the situation.  Assume full-responsibility: 
allow on-site personnel to make commitments to address a problem. 
 
5.   Document and follow-up special concerns or small details that may be 
important to a concerned individual.  Personal “client” service is an 
absolute necessity.  All involved must always strive to establish and 
maintain professionalism, integrity and credibility. 
 
6.   Project staff must stay focused on the ultimate goal. Reduction of fire risk 
 
requires the active and on-going involvement of all. 
 
7.    Success leads to success.  Recent history has demonstrated that many 
 
landowners throughout the community have seen ongoing and completed
 
treatments and have implemented similar treatments on their own land.  
 
 
Wildfire Prevention and Fire Loss Mitigation   Two documents and one                   
area-of-emphasis contribute greatly to community protection.  They include:   
 
Coconino NF Prevention Management Plan – See Appendix 6.  Only a few pages 
of the plan are included to demonstrate the ongoing prevention efforts of the 
USFS.  For detailed annual activities under the plan, visit their web site at: 
www.fs.fed.us/r3/coconino. 
 
Volunteer Agreement – Within the past month, an agreement between the USFS 
and various Fire Departments and Districts, has been finalized.  A long-sought 
objective of PFAC, the agreement allows Fire Departments and Districts to 
volunteer personnel and equipment to USFS prescribed burn operations.  This 
promises to permit effective hands-on training and greater treatment 
accomplishment than previously possible.

Structure Ignitability – Implementation of measures to reduce fire risk and improve 
community protection are not restricted to federal, state, county, or city lands: they 
must also occur on private property.  The interested reader is encouraged to visit 
www.firewise.org for additional details, or contact either the State Land Department or 
the appropriate Fire Department or District (see Section 5, p.71).    
Wildfire suppression will always be needed, but preparing and equipping homes and 
neighborhoods to live in a fire-environment is just as critical.  Developers and property 
owners can greatly enhance protection of their investments by establishing a FireWise 
property and neighborhood.  This is done by:   
A. Development Standards – Working with both Planning Departments and 
developers and property owners to incorporate FireWise techniques prior to 
construction can significantly reduce fire threat and improve public safety.  Efforts 
undertaken with a single owner prior to individual lot development is very efficient 
and greatly preferred.  Fire Departments and Districts can provide fuel reduction, 
access, water source, and street width and slope standards, along with bridge load 
limits and other fire protection needs/requirements during the planning stage, prior 
to actual development.     
B. Hazard Fuel Reduction – Treatment of an entire property, rather than a 
narrow strip or portion of a site, is the recommended and preferred method.  
Doing less simply creates the illusion of home or neighborhood protection.   
 
Treatments include selective thinning, brush disposal, and prescribed fire.  
Varied levels of treatment can occur on the property based on density and 
species of vegetation present, and location in relation to topography (ridge top, 
slope, aspect, presence of steep drainages, etc).   
 
 
The goal is to keep fire intensity low, keep the fire on the ground, and limit 
flame exposure to structures.  This can be accomplished as follows: 
 
1. 
Thin to reduce crown density with canopy breaks to eliminate crown fire 
spread, 
 
2. 
Eliminate low-hanging branches and other material which allows a 
ground fire to climb into trees (ie - ladder fuels), and  
 
3. 
Reduce excess fuel accumulations through removal or prescribed fire. 
 
Depending upon the property, these actions can generate large amounts of 
material that require disposal.  Methods utilized are often dependent upon such 
factors as amount produced, property location, and any restrictions currently in-
effect.  Techniques include burning, bulk curbside pick-up, transport to a waste 
management facility, or transformation into a useful product: examples of the 
later approach include removal for firewood or chipping for landscape use.

C. Fire Resistive Materials and Construction Techniques – Incorporation of these 
items into the design and construction phases of a building project directly 
contribute to structure survivability.  Examples include: 
1. Non-combustible roof material: Minimum of Class B or better.  
2. Limited combustible siding: large logs, stucco, rock, etc. 
3. Enclosed soffits 
4. Screened roof and crawl space vents: minimum of ¼ inch wire screen. 
5. Limited combustible decking material: to further promote FireWise efforts, 
enclose and/or keep areas underneath clear of debris. 
6. Double paned windows. 
 
7. Glass skylights (rather than plastic) 
 
8. Home suppression systems: several types are now entering the 
marketplace.  Activated in advance of an approaching wildfire, they are a 
viable form of home defense.  However, they do not replace the need to 
create a FireWise home environment utilizing all the techniques 
described in this section of the plan. 
 
D. Landscaping – Outdoor plantings are an important component of our 
community.  They add shade and beauty, buffer noise, provide privacy and 
inspiration, and supply habitat for wildlife.   Proper selection, placement, and 
maintenance of landscape plants can provide the desired benefits and not 
increase the risk to home and property.  However, improper selection, poor 
placement, or deficient maintenance of plantings can directly contribute to the 
destruction of a home during a wildfire event.  PFAC has produced a brochure 
on FireWise landscaping – consult their web site for details. 
 
There are four attributes of vegetation that should be considered when 
purchasing, planting, or conducting maintenance: 
 
1. Location: Vegetation can be close or even adjacent to a home, provided 
it is of the right kind and not part of a continuous “fuel-bed” leading up to 
the house.  Adjacent to a home, “specimen” type shrub and tree 
plantings should be considered.  These plantings should be isolated 
from others through both horizontal and vertical separation: grass, 
flowers, cinders, or mulch can be used to fill-in the gaps.

O c t o b e r  1 ,  2 0 0 4  
4 8

2. Type:  Highly flammable plants high in oils or resins should not be 
planted close to structures.  These plants will ignite easier and burn 
hotter than other types of vegetation.  If such plants are already in-place, 
consider removal.  If unable to do so, separate them from other existing 
vegetation by removal of adjacent plants.  Favor plants which naturally 
have a high moisture content as evidence by leaves which are often 
thick, soft, and pliable.  Ignition can still occur, but it will take longer and 
they will not burn as hot. 
 
 
 
 
3. Amount and Arrangement:  Large plants are acceptable, provided they 
are not crowded together in a continuous planting.  Tree branches 
should not interlock and form a closed, continuous canopy overhead.  
Such an arrangement allows heat and fire to be easily transmitted from 
one plant to another.  Shorter plants should not be placed where their 
presence could provide a “ladder” for a ground fire to climb higher into 
adjacent vegetation, thus endangering the home.  Consider plants that 
are low growing: If ignited, there will be less material to burn.  Be sure to 
inspect these plants regularly and remove any fallen leaves and needles 
that might collect in or under them.  In addition, dead material in plants 
should be removed during routine maintenance.  Weeds and grass 
should be routinely mowed to a height of two inches or less. 
 
4. Vigor: Healthy plants are better able to withstand the challenges of our 
environment.   Plants should be watered as required.  Consider use of 
native plants, many of which require less water than exotics.  Mulch 
should also be utilized to reduce watering needs: wood chips are OK 
provided they are placed so not to form a continuous fuel bed leading 
directly to the house.   
 
E. Annual Maintenance – Maintaining a FireWise property will decrease yearly 
fuel accumulations and limit potential ignition sources that could cause 
structures to ignite.  These include: 
 
1. 
Eliminate readily-combustible materials (ex: needles, hay bales, 
 
firewood, etc) to a distance at least 30 feet from structures. 
 
2. 
Clean needles, leaves, or any other combustibles from roofs, rain-
 
gutters, and under decks. 
 
3. 
Remove tree limbs which overhanging fireplace chimneys. 
 
4. 
Clear vegetation around propane tanks  
 
5. 
Remove dead vegetation 
 
6. 
Mow weeds and grass to less than 2 inches in height.

7. 
Remove branches and limbs that are within six feet of the ground 
 
F. Home Assessments – Fire Departments and Districts will conduct a free 
home/property assessment, upon request, to educate owners about fire threat and 
provide recommended mitigation methods. 
G. Neighborhood Coordination – Individual home protection is a necessary first 
step, but to achieve community protection, defensible neighborhoods are critical.  
Recent fires have conclusively demonstrated that an approaching wildfire can ignite 
individual structures, triggering a neighborhood conflagration beyond the response 
capability of firefighters.  Interested individuals, Home Owner Associations and 
others, such as Block-Watch or Woods-Watch groups, can be the needed catalyst 
to spur neighborhood action to reduce fire threat.   
Improved Protection Capabilities:  Several potential activities and efforts should be 
initiated or further developed, thereby increasing community protection.  These 
include, but are by no means limited to, the following:  
1. Survey existing neighborhoods.  Identify, map, and prioritize neighborhoods for 
neighborhood-wide home ignitibility reduction. 
2. Establishment of a Regional Fuels Crew – This would involve many different 
partners and require sufficient funding.  Principle among the partners would be 
PFAC members, but it could also involve NAU-ERI and GFFP as well.  The 
consolidated crew, larger than current separate efforts, would be under single 
leadership with standardized training, equipment, and treatments standards.  In 
addition to mitigation and prevention efforts, the crew could be available within 
the local area for fire suppression needs throughout the year.    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. Increased Public Education activities: Utilization of new outreach methods to 
prepare the community to receive fire – Currently, there are a number of 
education initiatives and outreach methods underway by area partners.  These 
include public meetings, presentations to service clubs, civic organizations and 
homeowner associations, media notices, periodic workshops and symposia, 
development/distribution of material, and participation in community events such 
as the Forest Festival, Science In-The-Park, and the County Fair.  Future 
activities might include involvement in the Northern Arizona Home Show, public 
service announcements, airing of informational videos on Public Access TV and 
public service announcements on commercial TV, recognition of FireWise 
communities by the national FireWise program, and development and 
maintenance of a joint-agency website devoted to this issue.   
 
4. Develop/adopt/implement Legislation & Appropriations (State/Federal) – 
Adequately fund and/or support, with sufficient oversight to ensure proper and 
timely application.  Items of current interest include:

4.  Recruitment of small-diameter, sustainable wood-based industry –   
                                  
Utilization of the large amounts of biomass that must be removed from area 
forests is critical to success.  This issue is covered elsewhere in this Section 
(See Utilization, p. 40). 
5. Fire District Formation – Some outlying homes within the CWPP are outside 
existing Fire Districts.  Owners within these areas should seriously consider 
formation of Fire Districts – via the County – to facilitate emergency response, 
prevention, and mitigation efforts.     
6. Compatible data-layers for the Sedona and Winona area to facilitate analysis of 
the entire CWPP area – Key information used in the development of this plan is 
lacking for the Sedona and Winona areas and/or not in the same format as that 
for the remainder of the area.  This somewhat complicated our use of the work of 
the NAU-ForestERA project.  Comparable data for areas with gaps should be 
developed to make future revision of this plan easier. 
7. Develop a standardized Neighborhood Wildfire Assessment format – The City of 
Flagstaff has recently received a donation from Allstate Insurance Foundation for 
just such an effort.  Once developed, it can be readily transferred to other 
jurisdictions within the CWPP area.  The information derived from this effort can 
augment the threat matrix data contained in this plan, as well as become an 
educational outreach tool to residents. 
8. Incorporation of CWPP into on-going activities and established land-
management and agency plans – Both PFAC and the GFFP intend to utilize this 
document to prioritize actions, secure funding, coordinate activities, implement 
treatments, and monitor desired outcomes.  The CWPP also provides guidance 
to private citizens in their effort to reduce their exposure to wildfire. 
9. Identification of additional resource and equipment needs – Individual agencies 
are responsible to provide appropriate administration and planning for their 
respective organization.  In addition, and to facilitate joint discussion and 
interoperability, PFAC, on an annual basis and with any needed assistance from 
GFFP, will host a multi-party discussion of current fire response capability within 
the CWPP area.  Centered on the goal of reviewing and revising the PFAC 
Operations Plan (Appendix 2), the discussion will include all facets of fire 
management resources and other topics that may be appropriate. 
10. Funding – This plan, and implementation of the identified activities, is intended to 
demonstrate our intent to implement and provide general information to 
appointed and elected officials and grant-funding organizations and agencies.  
Our coordinated effort to protect the greater Flagstaff community is a key 
ingredient to attracting additional funding to further implementation efforts.

11. Wood Distribution Networks – Establishment of on-going relationships with 
individuals and organizations on both the Hopi and Navajo Reservations, as well 
as with large charity organizations with interest and capability in wood 
delivery/distribution efforts, is an important utilization initiative.   There is 
tremendous need for wood products – primarily firewood and posts-and-poles 
throughout both areas.  It is estimated that over 75% of all homes on the 
Reservations have no electricity and require wood for heating and cooking.  
Creation of a steady “wood-pipeline” will not only benefit those who receive the 
wood, but also assist in reducing fire threat in our area by removal/utilization of 
excess small-diameter trees.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12. Statewide Mapping Effort – The "Arizona Fuels, Information, Restoration, and 
Education Mapping and Assessment Program" or ARIZONA FIRE MAP, is 
designed to establish and maintain a GIS-based mapping system that will 
document forest treatments, CWPP status, grant receipts, etc.  Forest treatments 
within the Flagstaff area have been used to develop a prototype map.  
Involvement with this effort, as it develops, will ensure our area remains at the 
forefront of statewide activities. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
13. Coordination with adjacent areas during development of their respective CWPP – 
Two adjacent areas where future plans may be developed are Sedona/Verde 
Valley and Williams/Parks-Bellemont.  Both Sedona and Parks-Bellemont are 
included in this plan: inclusion in another plan is encouraged, but synchronization 
will be required to ensure management conflicts do not occur. 
14. Adoption/implementation of the Coconino County Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard 
Mitigation Plan (MJHMP) and the Coconino County Emergency Management 
Plan (EMP) – Wildfire has been identified as one-of-five priority hazards within 
the County.  The MJHMP, upon approval by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) opens-the-door for pre-disaster mitigation funding 
and facilitates post-disaster mitigation and recovery efforts.  The all-risk EMP, 
currently under development, will ensure consistency in emergency prevention, 
mitigation, response (including evacuation protocols), and recovery efforts 
throughout the entire county. 
15. PFAC Operations and Smoke Management Plans – On an annual basis, a 
review and revision of each plan will occur.  
16. Development of a PFAC Prevention Plan – On an annual basis, a 
comprehensive Prevention Plan, using and incorporating the existing Coconino 
National Forest plan as a template (see Appendix 6), will be developed to 
coordinate activities, messages, etc.

17. Adoption and enforcement of appropriate codes throughout the Greater Flagstaff 
Area – Such action will ensure consistency on fire resistive construction, access, 
water, and addressing requirements, hazard fuel mitigation efforts, etc.  (The 
adoption of the remainder of the Governor’s “Arizona Forest Health Advisory & 
Oversight Councils” recommendations, identified on pg. 53 of this plan, will assist 
with this need.) 
18. Implement an appropriate monitoring program – Designed to track both 
accomplishments and effects of treatments, this will lend credibility to the effort 
and provide information necessary for the adaptive management of the plan.  
Perhaps this could be a project for an interested student or volunteer.  
19. Support the USFS in:   
 
 
 
 
                                   
a)  Encouraging development/use of a Wildland Fire Use Plan for application 
in appropriate wildland areas,                                                                          
b)  Application of the Appropriate Management Response for area wildfires     
c)  Planning, preparation, and implementation of prescribed fire projects 
Both GFFP and PFAC can provide leadership and assist with public educational 
needs to ensure community support of these two items.

Implementation and Monitoring 
 
                                                                                                                                                  
Community Mitigation Treatments:  The combined effects of fuel reduction treatments 
implemented through past projects with proposed treatments identified and prioritized in 
this plan will not create a completely “Fire Safe” community, nor eliminate the need for 
suppression operations.  Due to conditions outside our control, such as drought or 
extreme weather conditions, no one can guarantee total safety from wildfire.  However, 
this plan is based upon both science and experience, and implementation will greatly 
reduce fire threat and create a FireWise environment.  
 
Rather than recommending specific treatments, we have chosen to present, as found 
in Section 3, Desired Future Conditions (p. 37) and general Treatment Guidelines (p. 
38-47).  Variations of these guidelines have been successfully utilized by property 
owners and land managers in the area for a number of years.   
 
In this section, we have also chosen to present Treatment-Types utilizing the “coarse-
filter” approach and vocabulary available with ForestERA data: We recognize that site-
specific planning will need to occur prior to implementation of any treatment, and that 
the application of tree cutting, prescribed fire, etc, may differ somewhat from that 
described herein and must reflect silviculturally-accurate methodology and 
terminology.  Factors considered in defining these potential Treatment Types included 
(see “Treatment Types” in Glossary for definitions of terms): 
 
1. Overall reduction of predicted fire behavior from Active Crown Fire to Passive 
Crown Fire.  It is extremely difficult to move predicted fire behavior to Surface Fire 
with just initial treatment unless significant tree removal and pruning, along with 
surface fuel removal, occurs: even then, individual and small groups of trees may 
ignite. 
2. Treatment action in areas currently rated as Surface Fire will be as follows: 
a) Within the Interface Zone → Low Thinning Intensity, (if needed), followed by 
 
Light Prescribed Burn (Maintenance). 
b) Outside the Interface Zone, but within the Analysis Area → Light Prescribed 
Burn only, unless other factors or objectives dictate the need for Low Intensity 
Thinning. 
3. Protection of wildlife habitat (such as Mexican Spotted Owl and Northern 
Goshawk), municipal or other critical watersheds (such as Lake Mary and Rio de 
Flag), and specially designated areas (such as Kachina and Red Rock Secret 
Mountain Wilderness Areas and San Francisco Peaks and Oak Creek Canyon 
Research Natural Areas) were considered and included in the analysis.

O c t o b e r  1 ,  2 0 0 4

The exact location of the various potential Treatment Types may need to be slightly 
adjusted to take advantage of topographic or access features in order to facilitate 
effective and safe suppression actions when a major fire threatens the area.  Adaptive 
management requires adjustment and refinement as the effort moves forward, and we 
encourage treatments that have as their goal the reduction of fire risk and the 
improvement of overall forest ecosystem health. 
 
Five treatment types are recommended - three utilizing mechanical removal of trees 
followed by prescribed (broadcast) burning, and two burn-only treatments.  They 
include: 
 
Mechanical Thinning Followed by Prescribed Burn: 
Low Intensity = Light thinning followed by prescribed fire; representative of a 
maintenance fuel reduction or light restoration 
   Intermediate Intensity = Moderate thinning followed by prescribed fire; representative of 
a moderate fuels reduction or moderate restoration 
   High Intensity = Heavy thinning followed by prescribed fire; representative of a heavy 
fuels reduction or full restoration 
Prescribed Fire Only: 
Light Burn = No mechanical thinning (not required); maintenance burn (one goal is low 
tree mortality) on sites with light fuels 
      Heavy Burn = No mechanical thinning (restricted or impractical); thin with fire (one goal is
  
higher tree mortality) on sites with heavy fuels 
 
For additional discussion of these fuel treatments and how they were used in the 
analysis to modify predicted fire behavior, visit the ForestERA web site. 
 
In addition to vegetation treatments, FireWise building techniques and standards are 
required.  The Uniform Fire Code (UFC) and various Wildland Interface Fire Codes all 
provide the necessary framework, but not all areas can now adopt such codes based 
upon population, statutory authority, etc.  (This issue is addressed in Section 3 - 
Improved Protection Capabilities, p. 52.)  Currently, within the CWPP area, only the 
City of Flagstaff has requirements that all new developments implement a Fuel 
Management program prior to construction and that use of limited-combustible 
building material is mandatory in selected areas.  
 
Priority Areas and Treatment Costs:  The priority area for implementation of appropriate 
vegetative treatments is the entire Wildland/Urban Interface zone (map 5, p. 22).  
Achieving public safety and community protection through treatment of the most severe 
fuel accumulations nearest communities are the over-riding objectives.  Therefore, within 
the W/UI priority zone, emphasis should be placed on treating areas of predicted active 
crown fire behavior adjacent to communities or infrastructure.  In addition, anywhere 
surface fire behavior is predicted, these areas can be treated more quickly and at much 
lower cost with prescribed fire and may also be emphasized.

Over the long term, treatment of the remaining acreage within the Analysis Zone will 
need to be implemented.  However, sites within this area should reflect other values: 
public safety may not be the over-riding emphasis, and treatments must reflect those 
other values and resource management objectives.  Opportunities may arise where 
appropriate treatments within this area are desirable prior to treatments in the 
Wildland/Urban Interface: if this occurs, and the work will not jeopardize priority 
projects within the W/UI, the opportunity should not be missed.  Work in this area will 
require the JHA to review and refine any treatments in close collaboration with various 
stakeholders. 
 
Maps 11A (Wildland/Urban Interface) and 11B (Analysis Area), depict recommended 
locations of where the treatments should be located.  As indicated earlier, 
development of detailed prescriptions will be the responsibility of the JHA, and must 
be consistent with statutory authority and applicable land and resource management 
plans, be based on detailed knowledge of site conditions, and address specific 
resource management objectives. 
 
Table 8 identifies the acreage of each treatment type within the Wildland/Urban Interface 
and the remaining Analysis Area excluding the W/UI.  The table also provides an estimate 
of potential costs associated with applying the recommended treatments to the appropriate 
acres.  Based on best estimates of typical costs associated with planning and 
implementation of the five treatments in earlier projects, an “average” per/acre cost was 
determined and applied.  This data dramatically illustrates the financial commitment 
required to treat the recommended acres.  This cost demonstrates that from a strategic 
perspective, small-diameter wood-based enterprise development (including infrastructure 
development, wood utilization technology, sustained supply, and sufficient capital for 
business establishment and operating), all geared toward the establishment of a 
sustainable and effective industry that can offset some of the costs associated with 
hazardous fuel treatment, is critical if we are to succeed. 
 
Needed capital can take many different forms: subsides, low-interest loans, cost-share, 
profit-sharing ventures, and direct payments.  Funding sources may include numerous 
federal, state, local government, and private corporation ventures, and should include the 
entire gamut: planning, design, implementation, and monitoring.

Predicted Treatment Effects:  When proposed treatments are applied to the 
appropriate acres as recommended in this plan, the ForestERA model is capable of 
predicting and displaying potential effects on fire behavior resulting from treatment.  
Maps 12A and 12B depict the response of fire behavior to implementing the 
recommended treatments in the Wildland/Urban Interface and in the entire Analysis 
Area.  Although these are predicted effects, it does serve to illustrate the potential 
impacts of fuel reduction treatments on one of the parameters of most concern in 
protecting communities from catastrophic wildfire.  For comparison purposes, Map 13 
presents three maps side by side: predicted fire behavior under current conditions, 
predicted fire behavior after all recommended treatments are implemented in the W/UI, 
and predicted post-treatment fire behavior in entire Analysis Area.  Table 9 provides 
acreage and percent change in predicted fire behavior based on these maps. 
 
Monitoring and Assessment Plan:  In our efforts to reduce the threat of 
uncharacteristic wildfire to communities and restore fire to fire adapted ecosystems, we 
recognize that we do not fully understand the consequences of all management options.  
Similarly, we do not yet fully realize or appreciate the consequences of traditional 
treatment options in all areas or ecosystems.  In the face of uncertainty regarding the 
social, ecological, economic, and actual fire behavior changes as a result of fuels 
reduction efforts, and the concomitant potential “slowing down” of projects due to 
stakeholders’ concerns, appeals, and lawsuits, it is imperative that a targeted, efficient 
and effective monitoring program be integrated into land management actions.  
However, to best use the information gathered by such monitoring efforts, it is also 
imperative that we, as stewards of the land, use a decision making process that is 
adaptive, or able to alter the course of actions based on the best available information.  
This is what is intended by the process of adaptive management. 
 
To coordinate tracking and monitoring of the implementation of this CWPP, a Review 
Team should be established to include, at a minimum, representatives from GFFP, 
PFAC, Forest ERA, the USFS, local government, the environmental community, and 
citizens at large.  Initiating activities right after formal approval of the CWPP and utilizing 
input from various sources, the Review Team should evaluate and report on the 
accomplishments and challenges in meeting the overall goal of this plan:  
 
To protect Flagstaff and surrounding communities, and associated values and 
infrastructure, from catastrophic wildfire by means of:  
a) An educated and involved public,  
 
 
 
      
b) Implementation of forest treatment projects designed to reduce wildfire threat 
and improve long-term forest health, in a progressive and prioritized manner, 
and 
c) Utilization of FireWise building techniques and principles.

It is proposed that the Review Team also be tasked with designing and coordinating 
implementation of a multi-party monitoring program to acquire real data with which to 
accomplish their evaluation and reporting activities and implement adaptive 
management.  The monitoring program will need to address diverse areas such as fuel 
reduction and fire behavior, ecosystem restoration, ecological impacts, and social and 
economic issues, and should be based on existing monitoring protocols.  A framework of 
goals, objectives, and measurement methods, such as the “GFFP Monitoring & Research 
Teams Adaptive Management Framework” and which is included as Appendix 9, should 
be considered for inclusion in CWPP projects, based on the management objectives and 
potential impacts of each project.  Not every project will have the same degree of 
uncertainty, and not every project has the same number of factors that are potentially 
impacted.  The Review Team (or other appropriate body) may need to assess each project, 
and decide the level of monitoring that should be accomplished based on site-specific 
details, management objectives specific to existing conditions, desired future conditions, and 
the management options available to accomplish those objectives. 
 
All CWPP projects must allocate funds to accomplish monitoring (approximately 5-10% of 
project costs is a target), and establish a formal process for integrating the results of that 
monitoring through time back into the land management decision-making process.  One of 
the major benefits of monitoring projects and the cumulative effects of projects at the 
landscape level is that the process serves as a tremendous tool for public education and 
involvement, and as we learn from our failures and successes, there is greater agreement 
about how to proceed into the future. 
 
At a minimum, each of the three items in the goal above will be evaluated based upon 
the four criteria described below.  Not all may be applicable for each item, and 
additional criteria may be added.  They include: 
 
a. Implementation – A crucial aspect of measuring success will be actual 
implementation of needed treatments: Did they occur and in what locations?  
Treatment Maps (For example: Map 8, p. 29) will be updated annually and 
shared with the community and all responsible parties. 
b. Effectiveness – Of equal importance is the question of how effective are the 
various treatments: Have they done what was anticipated in terms of fire risk 
reduction?  Where possible, pre-and-post treatment fuel transects will be 
inventoried to determine actual change in fuel amounts.  Fire affects from 
subsequent wildfires will be evaluated to refine future treatments and the 
results shared with the community. 
c. Ecological Impacts – We continue to need a better understanding of how 
fuels reduction and forest restoration actions affect the plants, animals, soils, 
watersheds, and ecosystems within project areas.  If we are to be successful 
in restoring forests, we must understand the ecological effects of our various 
restoration strategies and actions, both at the project scale, and at the 
landscape scale.

d. Social Monitoring – Public attitudes toward both on-going and proposed 
treatments, and the agencies/organizations promoting and implementing 
them, is critical to success.  Assessment of these attitudes will be on-going, 
and will include review of the following indicators:  
¾ 
Editorials and other media coverage 
¾ 
Letters to editor 
¾ 
Requests for assistance 
At some point, it may be beneficial to engage the Behavioral Sciences Lab at 
Northern Arizona University (or another source) to conduct a scientific poll or 
survey to further refine treatments and guide education and planning efforts. 
         e.  Economic Impacts - If we are to achieve success, a sustainable utilization 
component is essential.  Of importance will be the success in attracting viable 
small diameter wood-based businesses into the area and evaluating their 
resulting economic impact.  Once in place, evaluation of this aspect will be 
coordinated with the Greater Flagstaff Economic Council. 
 
The Review Team should hold their initial meeting as soon as the CWPP is approved 
and establish a process to help facilitate implementation of the plan among the various 
land management agencies and to design and implement the monitoring program.  A 
formal convening of the Team should also be scheduled for six months after adoption 
of the CWPP to complete a comprehensive review of the Plan and develop any 
recommended revisions.  Thereafter, the Team should meet at least annually to 
review progress and make recommendations for appropriate revisions to the 
document.   
      
Roles and Responsibilities of Stakeholders:  As depicted on Table 10, successful 
implementation of the CWPP cannot be done without major cooperation from all.  
Without continued collaboration and mutual assistance, this plan will only provide a 
false sense of security.  Wildfire does not recognize property boundaries, and neither 
can we.

Assistance 
 
Development of the CWPP is a new initiative established under the HFRA of 2003.  
Since very few communities have completed plans – per guidelines set forth by the 
National Association of State Foresters, Communities Committee of the Seventh 
Forest Congress, Society of American Foresters, National Association of Counties, 
and Western Governors’ Association – reference material from other communities or 
groups regarding both specific plan content and process was limited.  Nonetheless, 
we believe we have developed a community supported CWPP that meets the intent of 
the HFRA. 
 
Important documents utilized during development of this plan include:

GLOSSARY 
 
Glossary terms come from several sources including:  
Arizona Forest Health Advisory Council. 2003. Guiding Principles for 
Forest Ecosystem Restoration and Community Protection. September 2003. 
Ecological Research Institute. 2004. Western Mogollon Plateau Adaptive 
Landscape Assessment Draft Report on Initial Workshop Outcomes. June 2004 
  
Basal Area (BA): The area of the cross-section of a tree trunk near its base, usually 4½ feet 
above the ground.  Basal area is a way to measure how much of a site is occupied by trees.  
The term basal area is often used to describe the collective basal area of trees per acre. 
 
Biodiversity (biological diversity): The variety of life and its process, including the variety in 
genes, species, ecosystems, and the ecological processes that connect everything in the 
ecosystem. 
 
Coarse-filter analysis: An analysis of aggregates of elements such as cover type or plant 
community. 
 
Community protection: Actions or programs undertaken for the purpose of protecting human 
lives, property, and infrastructure. 
 
Conservation: The careful protection, utilization and planned management of living 
organisms and their vital processes to prevent their depletion, exploitation, destruction, or 
waste. 
 
Critical habitat: According to Federal Law, the ecosystem upon which endangered and 
threatened species depend. 
 
Crown fire: This is a fire that travels from one crown (or tree top) to another in dense stands 
of trees, killing most trees in its path. However, even in intense crown fires, unburned 
strips may be left due to powerful, downward air currents. A passive (or dependent) crown 
fire relies upon heat transfer from a surface fire burning below crowns. An active (or 
independent) crown fire does not require transfer of heat from below the crowns, 
 
Defensible space: This is the area around a structure where fuels and vegetation are treated, 
cleared or reduced to slow the spread of wildfire towards the structure. It also reduces the 
chance of a structure fire moving from the building to the surrounding forest. Defensible 
space provides room for the firefighters to do their jobs. Many communities are taking a 
more holistic approach of creating defensible neighborhoods rather than jus individual 
properties.

Disturbance: A discrete event, either natural or human induced, that causes a change in the 
existing condition of an ecological system. 
 
Ecosystem: Living organisms interacting with each other and with their physical 
environment, usually described as an area for which it is meaningful to address these 
interrelationships. 
 
Ecological restoration: The process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been 
degraded, damaged, or destroyed. 
 
Fire Behavior:  As utilized throughout this plan -  
                                                                                                                                                  
Active Fire Behavior = Fires readily transition into tree crowns, with large group tree          
torching common: associated long-range (≥ .5 mile) spotting is common 
Passive Fire Behavior = Fires will transition into tree crowns, but only small-group or 
individual tree torching common: associated long-range spotting (≥ .5 miles) can occur 
Surface Fire Behavior = Fires stay on the ground, with little tendency to transition into tree 
crowns except in isolated cases: short-range spotting (≤ ¼ mile) can occur 
Fire Frequency (Fire Return Interval): How often fire burns a given area; often expressed in 
terms of fire return intervals (e.g., fire returns to a site every 5-15 years). (see also Fire 
Regime Group). 
 
Forest ecosystem health: A condition where the parts and functions of an ecosystem are 
sustained over time and where the system’s capacity for self-repair is maintained, allowing 
goals for uses, values, and services of the ecosystem to be met. 
 
Forest ecosystem restoration: Holistic actions taken to modify an ecosystem to achieve 
desired, healthy, and functioning conditions and processes. Generally refers to the process 
of enabling the system to resume acting, or continue to act, following the effects of a 
disturbance. Restoration management activities can be active (such as control of invasive 
species, thinning of over-dense tree stands, or redistributing roads) or more passive (more 
restrictive, hands-off management direction that is primarily conservation oriented). 
Frequently, a combination or number of actions is used sequentially to achieve restoration 
goals. 
 
Hazard: To place something of value in a risky or dangerous situation 
 
Hazardous fuel: Excessive live and dead trees and other vegetation and organic debris that 
increase the potential for uncharacteristically intense wildland fire and decrease the 
capability to protect life, property, and natural resources. 
 
Healthy ecosystem: An ecosystem in which structure and functions allow the maintenance 
of the desired condition of biological diversity, biotic integrity, and ecological processes 
over time.

Old growth tree; This is an old tree, one that exhibits the complex structural characteristics 
associated with the oldest age class of trees in a group, clump or stand. In today’s forests, 
an old growth tree in one that has been present since before the onset of commercial 
logging and fire exclusion. These trees are sometimes referred to as pre-settlement trees. 
These trees typically have orange or yellow platy bark. 
 
Prescribed fire: A management fire ignited to meet specific fuel reduction or other resource 
objectives. All prescribed fires are conducted in accordance with prescribed fire plans. 
 
Risk to communities: The risk associated with adverse impacts to communities resulting 
from unwanted wildfire. 
 
Reference conditions: Conditions characterizing ecosystems composition, structure, and 
their variability. 
 
Restoration: Actions taken to modify an ecosystem in whole or in part to achieve a desired 
condition. 
 
Surface fire: A fire that burns over the forest floor, consuming litter, killing aboveground 
parts of herbaceous plants and shrubs, and typically scorching the bases and crowns of 
trees.  
 
Sustainability: The ability of an ecosystem to maintain ecological processes and functions, 
biological diversity, and productivity over time. 
 
Threat:  An indication that an undesirable event or catastrophe may occur.  For this plan, a 
Threat matrix, using three items, was developed to permit focus upon the Interface Zone. 
 
Value – The measure of how strongly something is desired, expressed in terms of 
effort, money, etc one is willing to expend to attain or preserve it.  Two issues 
(Communities and Infrastructure, and Municipal Watersheds) were identified in this plan. 
 
Risk – The possibility of danger, injury, or loss.  Two issues (Predicted Fire Behavior 
and Post-Fire Flooding) were identified in this plan.   
 
Other – Further or additional issues.  One item (Areas upwind from at-risk communities 
(permitting fire spread into at-risk communities) was identified in this plan.

Treatment Types (potential): These are general descriptor terms only, not silvilcultural 
terms-   Thinning Intensity: 
     Low  
   = Simple thinning, w/prescribed fire  
     Intermediate  = Moderate thinning, w/prescribed fire  
     High   
   = Heavy thinning w/prescribed fire  
    
     Prescribed Fire only (Rx): 
  Light  =  No mechanical thinning: maintenance burn (one goal is lower tree  
 
        mortality) or sites w/light fuels (less intense fire) 
     Heavy = No mechanical thinning (required or practical): thin with fire (one          
                                goal is higher tree mortality) or sites w/heavy fuels (more intense  
                                fire  
 
Watershed: An area of land with a characteristic drainage network that contributes surface 
or ground water to the flow at that point: a basin or a major subdivision of a drainage basin. 
Wildland fire use: The management of naturally ignited wildland fires to accomplish 
specific pre-stated resource management objectives in pre-defined geographic areas 
outlined in Fire Management Plans.

Preamble to the Guiding Principles  
Arizona’s high country is home to magnificent forests harboring a diversity of biological, 
cultural, and economic values. Yet many of Arizona’s forests—especially Arizona’s 
extensive ponderosa forests—have undergone a dramatic transformation during the past 
century due to land use, climate, and other factors. These changes have increased 
insect and disease outbreaks, abnormally severe fires, and adversely affected biological, 
cultural, and economic values. The unacceptable risk posed by these conditions requires 
immediate and strategic action.  
Recognizing these factors, Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano convened a Governor’s 
Conference on Forest Health and Safety in March 2003. Findings from this conference 
led to the development of an Action Plan for Arizona, and a call for the creation of a 
broad, science-based Forest Health Advisory Council to provide recommendations on 
how to improve the health of Arizona’s forests. 
 
The Arizona Forest Health Advisory Council has developed these Guiding Principles to 
provide an overall framework for planning and implementing forest ecosystem restoration and 
community protection projects statewide. In presenting these Guiding Principles, the Council 
emphasizes the following:  
Different forest types have different natural disturbance regimes. For example, where 
crown fire is unnatural, thinning and prescribed burning may be needed to safely 
reestablish more natural surface fire regimes. But in forest types where crown fire is 
natural, such treatments may not be needed, at least from an ecological standpoint.

O c t o b e r  1 ,  2 0 0 4

Understanding these differences is fundamental to restoring more natural disturbance 
regimes in our forests.  
 
Community stakeholders must take the lead to implement these principles and make the 
decisions for their communities at risk. The Council stresses the immediate and urgent 
need to adequately reduce the risk to communities. This will require a comprehensive 
effort to reduce hazardous fuels in and around at-risk communities regardless of the 
adjacent ecosystem type. Fire research and recent fires demonstrate that fuels reduction 
treatments in and around communities may not prevent the loss of homes. Homeowners 
must do their part to create defensible space and replace or mitigate flammable building 
materials.  
 
Although Arizona’s forest and woodland ecosystems need restoration, it is important to 
understand that restoration is a young science whose long-term outcomes are uncertain. 
The Council urges employing a diversity of restoration strategies that fit local ecological, 
social, political, and economic circumstances. A “one size fits all” approach is not 
appropriate.  
 
Learning about restoration should be an active and ongoing process. A serious 
commitment to monitoring and adaptive management is critical to understanding the 
ecological, social, and economic dimensions of restoration. The Guiding Principles 
should be viewed as dynamic and adaptable to evolving conditions and experiences.  
 
The costs of restoration must be weighed against the costs of inaction. Though 
restoration may seem a weighty investment, it pales in comparison to the immediate and 
long-term costs and risks of allowing current forest conditions to persist. Restoration is a 
process of recovery requiring a substantial and sustained investment of funds, and 
political and public support.  
 
The Guiding Principles urge us to think big. Arizona’s forests and the ecological 
processes that sustain them span landscapes. Assessing needs, identifying priorities, 
and charting progress toward community protection and forest ecosystem restoration 
goals must occur within an appropriately large landscape context.  
 
The Council’s ultimate hope is that the Guiding Principles will help guide our movement 
toward sustainable and reciprocal relationships between human communities and forest 
ecosystems – relationships that sustain the biological, cultural, and economic values that 
contribute to a healthy democratic society, both now and into the future. 
 
Guiding Principles 
 
Integration  
The overall strategy for restoring forest ecosystem health and protecting 
communities must be dynamic, comprehensive and integrated. A primary 
component of the overall strategy is to perform a statewide forest health evaluation to 
identify high-priority communities, critical infrastructure, habitats, and watersheds at risk. 
This evaluation can also provide the framework for monitoring individual projects and 
cumulative effects.

Sustainable Communities and Economies 
Sustainable economies are linked to sustainable ecosystems. We should be 
building a sustainable future for Arizona’s forests and communities  
 
The immediate focus should be on protecting human communities at risk, critical 
infrastructure, along with key watersheds and habitats. Distinguishing between 
forest ecosystem restoration and community protection, and focusing on community 
protection within the entire community—private, public and tribal lands and the wildland-
urban interface—will improve the likelihood of success.  
 
Close collaboration among all stakeholders is essential to a community-based 
approach to forest ecosystem restoration and community protection. Encourage 
and empower community-based collaborations to demonstrate and implement effective 
community protection and forest ecosystem restoration. Be sensitive and responsive to 
the diversity of individuals and communities who value and/or depend on the forest and 
its resources.  
 
Decision-making about forest ecosystem restoration and community protection 
must occur with a serious commitment to rigorous adaptive management. Such an 
approach should include baseline data, short and long-term monitoring, and a 
transparent mechanism for tracking results, evaluating and incorporating findings into 
the decision-making process.  
 
Ecological Integrity 
Appropriate restoration methods are based on ecological need. These methods are 
further defined by the importance of the site in the watershed or landscape, and the 
timing, techniques and resources needed to restore ecological integrity. Restoration 
needs to be designed with a clear understanding of desired and ecologically appropriate 
future conditions.  
 
Effective forest ecosystem restoration should reestablish fully functioning 
ecosystems. A primary goal of forest restoration is to enhance ecological integrity, 
natural processes and resiliency to the greatest extent possible. Fire hazard reduction 
must be linked to the reintroduction of fire as a keystone ecological process. An active 
program of prescribed and maintenance burns and natural fire use is essential.  
 
Forest ecosystem restoration and community protection treatments should 
protect and enhance water and soil resources. The development and implementation 
of forestry best management practices will serve to protect these resources. 
 
Forest ecosystem restoration should protect and promote development of old-
growth trees and large trees needed to restore ecosystem structure and function.  
 
Landscape scale forest ecosystem restoration should maintain native plant and 
wildlife populations and habitat features. A key consideration is the need to maintain 
and restore movement corridors and refugia to avoid biodiversity bottlenecks.

Project work should be based upon landscape assessments of risks to and status 
of aquatic and terrestrial resources and of the potential for restoration to be 
successful. The assessment is used to identify the root causes of ecosystem 
degradation at the eco-regional, intermediate and site level scales, determine 
appropriate methods for restoring degraded systems and create a spatially-explicit 
prioritization of restoration needs.  
 
Land Use and Planning  
Forest ecosystem restoration must include evaluating and changing public land 
use practices that are scientifically demonstrated to contribute to forest health 
degradation.  
 
Forest ecosystem problems and solutions exist in a context of land use. In fire 
prone areas community officials must develop, adopt, and enforce comprehensive land 
use plans, zoning regulations and building codes for community protection, forest 
restoration, ecosystem health requirements and long-term fire management. Zoning and 
land use have a major impact on fire management, and can make a significant 
contribution to restoring forest health and protecting communities.  
 
Forest ecosystem restoration requires effective community protection to establish 
and maintain a fire-resistive condition for structures, improvements and 
vegetation. Methods for accomplishing this condition are based on public safety needs, 
fire hazard, and local capability and creativity. A fire-resistive condition will be 
accomplished by removing and modifying forest fuels, establishing defensible space, 
and use of fire-resistant construction materials and architectural design.  
 
Funding and Compliance  
Forest ecosystem restoration and community protection requires a sustained 
investment of federal, tribal, state, local and private resources. Restoration is a 
long-term process requiring a sustained commitment of funding. Adequate, sustained 
investment in forest ecosystem restoration and community protection is more cost 
effective and socially desirable than fire suppression and rehabilitation.  
 
Forest ecosystem restoration and community protection actions should comply 
with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.  
 
Practices  
Forest ecosystem restoration and community protection programs should use the 
lowest impact techniques that will be effective and efficient. Explore, develop and 
utilize low impact technologies to sustain and enhance ecosystem integrity and 
productivity, and minimize negative cumulative effects.  
 
All forest ecosystem restoration and community protection treatments should use 
locally adapted native plant materials to the greatest extent possible. Non-invasive, 
non-native species may be considered for emergency rehabilitation.

GLOSSARY  
 
Adaptive Management 
A type of natural resource management in which decisions are made as part of an 
ongoing process. Adaptive management combines planning, implementing, monitoring, 
research, evaluating, and incorporating new knowledge into management approaches 
based on scientific findings and the needs of society. Results are used to modify future 
management methods and policy.  
 
Biodiversity  
The variety of life forms and processes including complexity of species, communities, 
gene pools, and ecological functions.  
 
Biodiversity Bottleneck  
A bottleneck in this context is the assemblage of environmental and/or human-caused 
factors or ecological “threats” that hamper the ability of ecosystems to support 
biodiversity at its current level through time. The bottleneck analogy is that fewer 
organisms (and their genes) in the bottle (current conditions) may be able to emerge on 
the other side (future conditions) due to resource limitations. (Source: this council.)

Community Protection  
Actions or programs undertaken for the purpose of protecting human lives, property, and 
infrastructure. (Source: this council)  
 
Crown fire  
This is a fire that travels from one crown (or treetop) to another in dense stands of trees, 
killing most trees in its path. However, even in intense crown fires, unburned strips may 
be left due to powerful, downward air currents. A passive (or dependent) crown fire relies 
upon heat transfer from a surface fire burning below the crowns. An active (or 
independent) crown fire does not require transfer of heat from below the crowns. Source:

th 
Edition). John Wiley and Sons, Inc. New York, NY. p. 282. (See also 
Surface Fire)  
 
Cumulative Effects  
Individual actions when considered alone may not have a significant impact on the 
quality of the human environment. Groups of actions, when added together may have 
collective or cumulative impacts that are significant. Cumulative effects that occur must 
be considered and analyzed without regard to land ownership boundaries. Consideration 
must be given to the incremental effects of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable 
related future actions of the Forest Service, as well as those of other agencies and 
individuals. Source: CEQ Regulations applied to US Forest Service regulations

Defensible Space  
This is an area around a structure where fuels and vegetation are treated, cleared or 
reduced to slow the spread of wildfire towards the structure. It also reduces the chance 
of a structure fire moving from the building to the surrounding forest. Defensible space 
provides room for the firefighters to do their jobs.(New Mexico State Forestry) Many 
communities are taking a more holistic approach of creating defensible neighborhoods 
rather than just individual properties.  
 
Ecosystem  
A spatially explicit, relatively homogeneous unit of the earth that includes all interacting 
organisms and components of any part of the natural environment within its boundaries. 
An ecosystem can be of any size-a log, pond, field, forest, range or grassland, or even 
the earth' s biosphere. (Society of American Foresters, 1998.)  
 
Ecosystem Function  
The process through which the constituent living and nonliving elements of ecosystems 
change and interact, including biogeochemical processes and succession. 
 
Ecosystem/Ecological Integrity  
The completeness of an ecosystem that at multiple geographic and temporal scales 
maintains its characteristic diversity of biological and physical components, spatial 
patterns, structure, and functional processes within its approximate range of historic 
variability. These processes include: disturbance regimes, nutrient cycling, hydrologic 
functions, vegetation succession, and species adaptation and evolution. Ecosystems 
with integrity are resilient and sustainable.  
 
Ecosystem Process  
The actions or events that link organisms and their environment, such as predation, 
mutualism, successional development, nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, primary 
productivity, and decay. Natural disturbance processes often occur with some periodicity 
(From Webster's dictionary, adapted to ecology).  
 
Ecosystem Resilience  
The ability of a system to respond to disturbances. Resiliency is one of the properties 
that enable the system to persist in many different states or successional stages.  
 
Fire Frequency (Fire Return Interval)  
How often fire burns a given area; often expressed in terms of fire return intervals (e.g., 
fire returns to a site every 5-15 years). (see also Fire Regime Group).  
 
Fire Regime Group  
A generalized description of the role fire plays in an ecosystem. It is characterized by fire 
frequency, predictability, seasonality, intensity, duration, and scale (patch size), as well 
as regularity or variability. (See also Fire Frequency)

Forest Ecosystem Health  
A condition where the parts and functions of an ecosystem are sustained over time and 
where the system's capacity for self-repair is maintained, allowing goals for uses, values, 
and services of the ecosystem to be met.  
 
Forest Ecosystem Restoration  
Holistic actions taken to modify an ecosystem to achieve desired, healthy, and 
functioning conditions and processes. Generally refers to the process of enabling the 
system to resume acting, or continue to act, following the effects of a disturbance. 
Restoration management activities can be active (such as control of invasive species, 
thinning of over-dense tree stands, or redistributing roads) or more passive (more 
restrictive, hands-off management direction that is primarily conservation oriented). 
Frequently, a combination or number of actions is used sequentially to achieve 
restoration goals.  
 
Hazardous Fuel  
Excessive live or dead trees and other vegetation and organic debris that increase the 
potential for uncharacteristically intense wildland fire and decrease the capability to 
protect life, property, and natural resources.  
 
Invasive or Noxious Weed (also applies to animals and other organisms)  
Any species of plant which is, or is liable to be, detrimental or destructive and difficult to 
control or eradicate and shall include any species that the director, after investigation 
and hearing, shall determine to be a noxious weed. Arizona Revised Statutes 3-201 
http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ars/3/00201.htm  
 
Landscape  
An area composed of interacting and inter-connected patterns of habitats (ecosystems) 
that are repeated because of the geology, landform, soils, climate, biota, and human 
influences throughout the area. Landscape structure is formed by patches (tree stands 
or sites), connections (corridors and linkages), and the matrix. Landscape function is 
based on disturbance events, successional development of landscape structure, and 
flows of energy and nutrients through the structure of the landscape. A landscape is 
composed of watersheds and smaller ecosystems. It is the building block of biotic 
provinces and regions.  
 
Natural Disturbance Regime  
A natural disturbance (e.g. fire, insect outbreak, flood) with a characteristic frequency, 
intensity, size, and type that has influence on an ecosystem over evolutionary time. 
 
Old Growth Tree  
This is an old tree, one that exhibits the complex structural attributes associated with the 
oldest age class of trees in an old growth stand. In today’s forests, an old-growth tree is 
one that has been standing since before the onset of commercial logging and fire 
exclusion. These trees are sometimes referred to as pre-settlement trees. Old-growth 
ponderosa pine trees typically have orange, platy bark. Source: Schubert, G.H. 1974.

Prescribed Fire  
Any fire ignited by management actions to meet specific objectives. All prescribed fires 
are conducted in accordance with prescribed fire plans. (See also Wildland Fire Use)  
 
Risk to Communities  
The risk associated with adverse impacts to communities resulting from unwanted 
wildland fire.  
 
Surface fire  
A fire that burns over the forest floor, consuming litter, killing aboveground parts of 
herbaceous plants and shrubs, and typically scorching the bases and crowns of trees.

Sustainable (Sustainability)  
Meeting the needs of the current generation without compromising the ability of future 
generations to meet their needs. Ecological sustainability entails maintaining the 
composition, structure and processes of a system, as well as species diversity and 
ecological productivity. The core element of sustainability is that it is future-oriented. 
(Committee of Scientists Report, 1999.)  
 
Wildland Fire Use  
The management of naturally ignited wildland fires to accomplish specific pre-stated 
resource management objectives in pre-defined geographic areas outlined in Fire 
Management Plans. (See also Prescribed Fire)  
 
Wildland-Urban Interface  
The area or zone where structures and other human development meet or intermingle 
with undeveloped wildland or vegetative fuel.

Purpose   
 
The purpose of this document is to prepare an organized operations plan that will be in place in the 
event of any initial or extended attack fires within the PFAC response area.  This area includes the 
cities of Flagstaff and Sedona as well as the following fire districts; Flagstaff Ranch, Highlands, 
Mormon Lake, Parks-Bellemont, Pinewood, Sedona and Summit Fire.   This area also includes all of 
the State and Federal lands throughout this area.  This plan is meant to deal with incidents that do not 
exceed the complexity level of a Type 3 incident. This plan builds on the current Mutual Aid 
Agreement amongst all PFAC members and will help to maximize effectiveness and efficiency in 
providing safe and professional responses to wildland fire incidents throughout our area. 
 
 
Initial Incident Notification and Dispatch Procedures

In order to clearly understand our dispatch procedures, please understand the distinctions between 
the three primary dispatch centers we will be dealing with. 
 
“Flagstaff”- This dispatch center is run by the Coconino National Forest and will be the primary 
dispatch center for all wildland incidents.  While it is not always staffed 24 hours a day, there is an 
answering service that will begin the activation process if any call is made to the Fire Reporting 
number, 526-0600. 
 
“Alarm” (Flagstaff/Coco Co. 911) - This dispatch center is run by the City of Flagstaff Police 
Department and also dispatches for the Coconino County Sheriff’s Office.  “Tones” will be given by 
this center to initiate a wildland fire dispatch to all northern fire departments, which will then 
transfer to Channel 10 and have all further communications with “Flagstaff”. 
 
“Alarm” (Sedona FD, Pinewood FD) - This dispatch center is run by the Sedona Fire Department.  
“Tones” will be given by this center to initiate a wildland fire dispatch to all southern fire 
departments, which will then transfer to the Flagstaff Coconino 1 Channel and have all further 
communications with “Flagstaff”. 
 
1) Call comes into an Alarm Center  
Alarm locates jurisdictional responsibility and dispatches those resources.  After agency 
notification, Alarm will immediately notify Flagstaff of the incident and which units are 
responding.  Flagstaff will dispatch any additional or requested resources based upon the 
predetermined Dispatch Model for Fire Danger Levels. 
 
2) Call comes into Flagstaff  
Flagstaff will immediately determine jurisdictional responsibility and dispatch closest 
available state or federal resources based upon the Dispatch Model for Fire Danger Levels.  
Flagstaff will contact an Alarm Center if the closest available resources are not state or 
federal units and Alarm will initiate dispatch.  Initial dispatching of resources will be based 
upon the predetermined Dispatch Model for Fire Danger Levels.   
 
3) Call comes into Arizona State Land 
In the case of Initial Attack fires, all dispatches for SLD will go through Flagstaff. Flagstaff 
will dispatch appropriate agencies as indicated in the Dispatch Model for Fire Danger 
Levels. The ASLD will provide to the responding agency or agencies the authority to make 
appropriate requests for resources until their arrival. 
 
All dispatch duties after the initial dispatch will be done by Flagstaff.

Dispatch Model for Fire Danger Levels 
(These are minimum dispatch levels and may be adjusted accordingly). 
 
Flagstaff will dispatch resources based on fire danger levels. They are L=Low, M=Moderate, 
H=High, VH=Very High, and E=Extreme. 
 
1) Single Jurisdiction Fire: 
 
L-H 
The agency of jurisdiction will be dispatched to this incident.  Adjacent 
jurisdiction(s) who feel their jurisdiction could be threatened may also 
respond. 
 
VH- E 
Flagstaff will automatically dispatch an additional two (2) engines, water 
tender, and two (2) overhead above the normal dispatch of resources as 
available.  A dozer will be dispatched as requested by the IC or at the 
discretion of Flagstaff. 
 
2. Multi-jurisdictional Fire: 
 
 
L-H 
 Primary Jurisdiction/Closest Available Resources respond as appropriate. 
(USFS & FD) Adjacent jurisdiction(s) who feel their jurisdiction could be 
threatened may also respond. 
                         
VH-E       
Flagstaff will automatically dispatch an additional two (2) engines, water 
tender, and two (2) overhead above the normal dispatch of resources as 
available.  A dozer will be dispatched as requested by the IC or at the 
discretion of Flagstaff. 
 
The purpose of identifying a Dispatch Model for Fire Danger Levels, especially during Very High to 
Extreme conditions, is to keep small fires from getting large.  We encourage fire agencies to monitor 
USFS Channel 1 and if a ‘fire flash’ is in your jurisdiction to initiate a response.  It is imperative 
that if a response is initiated in this manner or if a report comes directly into an agency, contact with 
Flagstaff and Alarm should be done immediately.  If Flagstaff gets notification of an incident 
during Very High to Extreme conditions, they will immediately dispatch closest available 
resources as identified in the Fire Order Model for Dispatch. 
 
Please note that all non-jurisdictional companies will be released as soon as possible to become 
available back in their home areas.  Also, the response request can be denied by the requested 
agency if they can not meet the demands of the request. 
 
C W P P - F l a g s t a f f  &  S u r r o u n d i n g  C o m m u n i t i e s                
O c t o b e r  1 ,  2 0 0 4  
9 6

 
 
Contact with both Flagstaff and Alarm will also be made when any agency is involved in an 
incident(s) that removes all of their resources from availability.  If this notification is made, a time 
frame should be given for unavailability.  When units become available, contact will be made to both 
Flagstaff and Alarm of their availability.   
 
After the initial dispatch, all units will use Forest Service Channel 1 to communicate with all units 
responding to a wildland incident.  Upon arrival at the incident, the use of a tactical channel(s) will 
be used as designated by the IC.  The following channels will be identified as Group 2 for Initial 
Attack (IA) in those radios that are capable of multiple groups or are field programmable.  Please 
note:  The City of Flagstaff Fire Department does not have multiple group radios and use of our 
standard group one channels will be necessary.  It is only at the request of the IC that the use of the 
pre-identified Group 2 frequencies will be used. 
 
As this Operations Plan is a supplement to our existing PFAC Mutual Aid Agreement, all agencies 
agree to allow the use of their frequencies to other agencies while involved in the mitigation of an 
incident. 
 
Emergency Scene Operational Responsibilities 
 
Regardless of jurisdiction, first on scene unit will assume Incident Command.  IC will communicate 
with Flagstaff the following: 
a. 
Initial size-up to include size, IC, fire name, etc. (use IRPG) 
b. 
Location/Jurisdiction  
c. 
Additional resource requirements 
d. 
Immediate concerns, exposures, access, etc. 
At this time, command of the incident may be transferred to the appropriate jurisdictional personnel 
or may be transferred due to the level of complexity of the incident. 
 
2) Aviation Operations in the Urban Interface / Congested Areas 
 
All aircraft use will be ordered and coordinated through the Flagstaff Zone Dispatch Office 
in accordance with established procedures in the Southwest Area Mobilization Guide.   
 
The following will apply to determine air-tanker use when dispatched to congested areas: 
1. A Lead Plane will be ordered any time an air-tanker has been requested for use in a 
congested area.  Air Tanker Drops may precede before the Lead Plane arrives if 
communications are established between the aircraft and Incident Commander, 
authorization is granted from the IC, and the line is cleared of personnel and 
equipment prior to commencing retardant operations.

2. Aerial supervision (Air Tactical Group Supervisor) is recommended when there are 
more that two aircraft or a mix of aircraft (fixed/rotor-wing) over the incident at the 
same time.   
3. An Air Operations Branch Director will be ordered for any fire requiring continuous 
air-tanker or helicopter operations within the congested area to coordinate with the 
Flagstaff Airport Manager and/or Control Tower in the designing and implementation 
of Temporary Flight Restrictions and aviation operations.  The AOBD may also assist 
in the establishment of dip-sites and heli-base operations. 
 
3) Temporary Flight Restrictions 
 
When fires occur, there may be a need to request Temporary Flight Restrictions to secure 
airspace over the incident for aviation operations.  These restrictions will be requested by 
the Incident Commander, Air Tactical Group Supervisor, or the Air Operations Branch 
Director through the Flagstaff Zone Dispatch Center.  The request will be made to the 
Southwest Coordination Center, who will advise when the TFR goes into effect.  This may 
take 2-4 hours.  When the restriction is no longer needed, it should be rescinded as soon as 
possible.   
 
The TFR will need to be configured and closely coordinated with the Flagstaff Airport 
Manager and Control Tower as  nearly every portion of our urban interface areas have the 
potential to impact airport operations.  A guide for Incident Commanders in determining 
the need for a TFR includes: 
 
• 
Type and number of aircraft operating (Air Tactical, air-tanker, helicopter) within the 
incident and their aeronautical requirements including orbit dimensions horizontally

When the Type 3 Team is called for, Flagstaff will begin the notification process for the Type 3 
Team.  The County Emergency Services Coordinator and/or City Manager will be notified 
immediately by Flagstaff through the appropriate Alarm Center.   It will be the County Emergency 
Coordinator or City Manager’s decision to activate the EOC.   
 
Joint Information Center 
 
If an EOC is established a Joint Information Center will also be established at the EOC.  If an EOC 
is not established, the Joint Information Center will be located at the Peaks Ranger District, the 
Flagstaff Law Enforcement Administrative Facility (LEAF) or Sedona Fire Station #1. 
 
Law Enforcement 
 
Law enforcement is recognized as a needed and essential part of any IA fire of any consequence.  
The appropriate LE agency having jurisdiction in the area of a fire will be notified immediately.  The 
Law Enforcement Representative will meet with either the Liaison Officer or IC.  As needed, a Law 
Enforcement Branch will be established. 
Responsibilities for Law Enforcement will be determined by their representative and the Incident 
Commander. 
 
1) Evacuation 
Upon determination by the Incident Commander and/or the Sheriff that evacuation procedures 
are warranted, the Coconino County Sheriff's Office, the City of Flagstaff Police Department, 
the Sedona Police Department, the Arizona Department of Public Safety, the Arizona 
Department of Transportation, or any other appropriate law enforcement agencies shall be 
responsible for implementing an appropriate evacuation.  The Law Enforcement Liaison shall 
report evacuation progress to the Incident Commander, on a regular basis.  CCEM must be 
notified early in this process, to provide appropriate reception areas/shelters. 
 
2) Traffic Control 
The Coconino County Sheriff's Office, City of Flagstaff Police Department, and other law 
enforcement agencies shall be responsible for implementing a traffic control plan.  
Continued communication with the Liaison or the IC is essential. 
                                       
It is important that a law enforcement liaison be established early in the incident (at the 
Command Post) in order to minimize traffic congestion and maintain safety to the public.

3) Security 
It shall be the responsibility of the jurisdictional law enforcement agency to establish, when 
appropriate, a security patrol for evacuated areas yet to be immediately threatened by fire (pre-
cautionary evacuation mode), in conjunction with the law enforcement coordinator assigned to 
the command staff.  The appropriate LE agency will assist in securing the perimeter of the 
incident to allow authorized persons only into and out of the area.

Purpose:  Catastrophic wildfire is the #1 threat to the greater Flagstaff area.  A wide range of 
community values – documented elsewhere – are impacted by these type wildfires.  Reducing 
overabundant natural fuel accumulations and improving forest health within and adjacent to 
communities must occur.   
 
One method to do so is the application of prescribed (Rx) fire.  Rx fires reduce slash accumulations 
produced during fuel reduction projects, as well as forest surface fuels that have accumulated during 
the past decades.  Restoring fire to the ecosystem improves forest health  increases community 
protection capability. 
 
Background:  Smoke is a natural result of fire: the issue we must focus on is not if we should have 
smoke - we have no choice: it will either be wildfire or prescribed – but when, where, and under 
what conditions it will occur.  The only way we can focus on, and manage, these issues, is with 
application of Rx fire and implementation of a Community Smoke Management Plan (CSMP). 
 
Components:  The three primary components of this plan are: 
 
Emission Reduction Techniques:  These include, but are no means limited to – 
 
• Removing wood products (firewood, post-and-pole, etc) 
• Allowing sufficient time for material to dry 
• Avoiding stumps, downed logs, snags 
• Restricting piles or acreage 
• Limiting consecutive burn days in same area  
• Utilizing proper ignition patterns 
• Timing ignitions to coincide with favorable weather events 
• Scheduling to avoid special event days or high-occupancy sites 
 
Public Awareness:  Three separate areas require continuing attention - 
 
1) On-Going:  Brochures, website information, special presentations, and media interviews 
are valuable techniques to establish the purpose of Rx fire, methodology of planning, 
ERT’s and control efforts, future plans, agency coordination practices, and results of 
previous burns.  Together, these will serve to reduce concerns associated with Rx fire.   
 
2) Pre-Fire:  These announcements must inform the public of project locations, dates and 
times of implementation, and homeowner mitigation measures they can implement to 
reduce impacts to their own health, property, and daily activities.  They can be distributed 
through the media, posting specific project information on agency websites; notifying 
homes and neighborhoods immediately adjacent to burns as well as areas  which will be 
significantly impacted (both day and night), and personal contacts to individuals with high 
health concerns.  Fire managers must provide a common message including project goals 
and smoke mitigation efforts.

O c t o b e r  1 ,  2 0 0 4  
1 0 3

 
3) During Burn:  Techniques during an on-going Rx fire could include empowering each 
person on-site to act as an Information Officer if approached by the public, placement of a 
designated person at a site easily accessible to the public and within site of the burn to 
answer questions, or leading field tours for interested people.  If unexpected conditions 
occur during the operation, efforts to minimize impacts should be announced, what is 
being done to mitigate the impacts, and responsibility stated to ensure continued public 
acceptance of the program. 
 
Agency Coordination:  A culture of open-and-continuing communication and coordination 
between land management agencies, fire management professionals, public health organizations, 
and air quality regulators is critical for an efficient and effective Rx fire program.  Project 
planning, treatment priorities, coordination with adjacent Rx fires, resource sharing, public 
notification, and potential smoke impacts and mitigation efforts require discussion and joint 
involvement.   
 
Monitoring day and night smoke movements through personal observations, mapping, and 
photographs will enable local fire managers to document and share information on smoke-travel 
patterns, effectiveness of smoke mitigation efforts, and potential accuracy of forecasted weather 
information.  Instrument-based air-quality monitoring, the responsibility of regulatory agencies, 
can help determine visual and health impacts, compliance with air quality standards, and provide 
information necessary to refine future Rx fire efforts.  In addition, post-Rx fire reviews are 
beneficial so lessons can be identified and shared with others. 
 
Permits:  Local Fire Depts and Fire Districts are allowed, through an agreement with the AZ Dept 
of Environmental Quality (ADEQ), to issue permits for small debris burns within their jurisdiction.  
State and Federal agencies, and larger burns within the Fire Dept/Fire District jurisdictions, require a 
permit from ADEQ.  Permit information is available at:   
www.adeq.state.az.us/environ/air/assess/smp.html  
 
Public Notification Contacts: 
 
1)   Contact information for PFAC agency personnel can be found in PFAC   
          
Operating Plan (Appendix 1 to the CWPP) 
2) Each agency will maintain their own individual homeowner/business contact list 
Result:  Effectiveness of the CSMP will be determined by level of public awareness, including 
acceptance of reasonable smoke, the success of agency coordination, and the continued-and-timely 
application of ERT’s.  Efforts to further the Rx fire program will pay dividends in the future: the 
wise use of Rx fire will reduce fire threat, improve forest health, and protect our community.

STATUS REPORT  
Small Diameter Timber Utilization 
 
 
 
July 15, 2004 
Twenty years from now, the greater Flagstaff area 
will be home to a small but thriving sector of 
businesses based on the ecologically sustainable 
utilization of forest products. Revenues created 
through the sale of these forest products will provide the economic engine for ecosystem restoration 
efforts in the region's forests. 
 
Businesses will include primary producers of forest products and "value-added" processors 
employing technologies that maximize the value of forest products. Availability of these forest 
products will be based on long-term forest management planning, and healthy ecosystem 
functioning, seeking a sustainable and stable flow of products to users, which in turn will provide 
stable jobs and benefits for local workers and the community.

Introduction 
 
This Plan has been prepared for the Coconino National Forest using the Risk Assessment and 
Mitigation Strategies (RAMS) planning process.  RAMS was developed for fire managers to be a 
holistic approach to analyzing wildland FUELS, HAZARD, RISK, VALUE, and SUPPRESSION 
CAPABILITY.  It considers the effects of fire on unit ecosystems by taking a coordinated approach 
to planning at a landscape level, and allows users to develop fire prevention and/or fuels treatments 
programs. 
 
The steps involved in this process included: 
 
 
Listing Management Objectives for the Coconino National Forest 
 
Identification of spatial Compartments for study 
 
Assessment of significant issues within each Compartment 
 
Identification of Management Objectives within each Compartment 
 
Identification of Fire Management Zones (FMZs) and Sub-Units 
 
Development of Alternative Fire Prevention Program Options 
 
Creation of Personnel and other Expense Prevention Budgets 
 
Identification of detailed Prevention Work Programs 
 
Development of a total Fire Prevention Program and budget

ELECTRICAL 
 
Electrical Safety Facts 
General:   An important part of the disaster recovery is hazard recognition.  Should you come across 
damaged or fallen power poles or lines, contact your local electrical power authorities.  DO NOT 
TOUCH THE DOWNED WIRES.  In the cleanup area, be especially careful when cutting trees and 
operating heavy equipment around power lines.  Vegetation and power poles may have lost stability 
due to fire damage. 
 
If a power line or pole should fall next to you while working in the area, do not walk – hop out of the 
area.  (Using this technique, you will be less likely to be a conductor of electricity).

Electricity is always trying to go somewhere.  It goes easily through conductors; it does not go easily 
through non-conductors.

One of the most important fixtures in the conduction of electric current are utility poles.  The fire or 
fire suppression actions may have dislodged or broken some of these poles, causing the wires to sag or 
break, resulting in extremely hazardous conditions.  Do not touch anything at the scene. 
 
Trees can also be dangerous conductors of electricity.  When a tree falls or grows into contact with 
power wires, the electric power diverts and finds a path to the ground through the branches and the 
trunk.  Anyone who comes into contact with these trees is subject to tragic consequences, since electric 
power can easily jump from the tree to the person. 
 
Electrical Safety Tips 
• 
Do not overload circuits; don’t operate several large appliances at the same time on the same 
circuit. 
• 
Do not use extension cords to plug in many items on one outlet. 
• 
Turn off appliances when you finish using them.  Provide adequate air circulation around all 
appliances to prevent over-heating.  Keep appliances clean, repaired and serviced. 
• 
Check wires and plugs regularly.  Replace worn or frayed wires.  Do not run cords under 
carpets or across doorways. 
• 
Be careful when replacing fuses or breakers.  Keep the area near the circuit box dry and turn 
the main switch off before changing the fuse/breaker. 
• 
Temporary lines should be removed from service. 
 
 
Electrical Locations To Avoid 
• 
Electrical meters and service lines coming into the home or other outbuildings. 
• 
Any power supply line which appears to sag, show bare wire, or have insulation missing. 
• 
Secured power sub-stations or any area identified as high voltage. 
• 
Downed power lines. 
 
Emergency Procedures for an Electrical Fire 
• 
Call the fire department. 
• 
Shut off power supply at the breaker if possible. 
 
Restoring Electric Power 
If, upon returning to your residence, there is no electrical power, please check to make sure the main 
breaker is on.  If the breakers are on and power is still not present, please call to report the power 
outage to your local electrical power authorities. Reporting problems like a down or broken wire will 
speed up the process of power restoration.

• 
Stand off to one side of the breaker box when turning on the main breaker.  Do not stand 
directly in front of the box. 
• 
If any smells of hot electrical insulation or sparking occurs, turn of the breaker immediately and 
call an electrician. 
• 
If electrical lights or appliances appear brighter than normal, turn off main breaker.  The 
service entrance needs to be checked. 
 
To Change A Fuse 
Try to find the cause of the blown fuse, and correct it by disconnecting the defective appliance or 
appliances causing the overload or short circuit.  Shut off the main power switch when you change the 
fuse. 
 
¾ 
Do not replace fuses with a higher amp rating fuse than you removed. 
¾ 
Turn on the main switch to restore the power. 
¾ 
If the fuse blows again, leave it alone and contact a certified electrician.  Other problems 
may exist and should be investigated to remove the possibility of an electrical fire. 
 
To Reset A Circuit Breaker 
Try to find the cause of the overload or short circuit and correct it by disconnecting the defective 
appliance or appliances.  Turn the switch to “on” to reset and restore power.  If breaker trips again 
leave it alone, and contact a certified electrician.  Other problems may exist and should be found to 
remove the possibility of an electrical fire. 
 
 
Special Information of Fuses & Circuit Breakers 
Fuses and circuit breakers shut off the current whenever too much current tries to flow through a wire 
because of: 
 
• 
A short circuit, possibly caused by a bare wire touching the ground;  
• 
Overloading, possibly caused by too many lights or appliances on one circuit; or 
• 
By defective parts in an appliance. 
 
Know where the main circuit or fuse box is located in your house.  Be sure you can locate the main 
switch; it controls all of the power coming into the house and is usually inside the circuit box.  In some 
cases, however, it may be located outside of the house.  Fuse or circuit boxes generally are labeled to 
designate which area of the house the circuits or fuses serve. 
 
DRINKING WATER 
 
Restoring Water Systems 
Unless impacted by a fuel spill, the fire should not have affected wells at undamaged homes.  If your 
house was damaged, your water system may potentially have become contaminated with bacteria due 
to loss of water pressure.  In this case it is recommended that the well be disinfected and the water be 
tested before consumption.  To disinfect your water system, pour ½ - 1 cup of chlorine bleach inside the

well casing and turn on all faucets until a chlorine scent in noticed.  Allow the chlorine solution to 
remain in the system overnight.  The following morning, open all faucets and flush the system until free 
of chlorine smell. 
 
If you have a public use well or water system, contact the County Health Department for specifics on 
testing prior to consumption of any water.   
 
SOLID WASTE 
 
Removing Debris 
 
Cleanup of your property can expose you to potential health problems from hazardous materials.  Wet 
down any debris to minimize health impacts from breathing dust particles.  The use of a two-strap dust 
particulate mask with nose clip and coveralls will provide the best minimal protection.  Leather gloves 
should be worn to protect your hands from sharp objects while removing debris.  
 
Hazardous materials such as kitchen and bathroom cleaning products, paint, batteries, contaminated 
fuel and damaged fuel containers must be handled properly.  Contact the City of Flagstaff or Coconino 
County for specific handling restrictions and disposal options. 
 
All hazardous materials should be labeled as to their contents if known!   
 
 
HEATING FUELS 
 
Checking Propane Tanks 
 
Propane suppliers recommend homeowners contact them for an inspection prior to reusing their 
system.  If the fire burned the tank, pressure relief valve probably opened and released the contents of 
the tank.  Tanks, brass and copper fittings, and lines may be heat-damaged and unsafe.  Valves should 
be turned off and remain closed until the propane suppliers inspect the system. 
 
Checking Home Heating Oil Tanks 
 
Heating oil suppliers recommend homeowners contact them for an inspection prior to reusing their 
system.  The tank may have shifted or fallen from the stand and fuel lines may have kinked or 
weakened.  Heat from the fire may have caused the tank to warp or bulge.  Non-vented tanks are more 
likely to bulge or show signs of stress.  The fire may have loosened or damaged fittings and filters.  If 
the tank is in tact and heating oil remains in the tank, the heating oil should still be good.  If you have 
questions on the integrity of the tank, fuel lines, tank stand, or the fuel, or need assistance in moving the 
tank or returning it to service, contact your fuel supplier.

MISCELLANEOUS SAFETY AWARENESS 
 
Ash Pits 
Holes created by burned trees and stumps create ash pits, which are full of hot ashes.  Mark them for 
your safety, as they can stay hot for many days following the fire, causing serious burns.  Warn your 
family and neighbors, especially children.  Tell them to watch for ash pits and to not put hands or feet 
in these holes—they are hot! 
 
Evaluation of Trees Damaged by Fire 
The following information will assist you in evaluating any trees that have been scorched or burnt by 
the fire.  Identification of the type of tree affected is important and can easily be done.  Two basic types 
of trees exist in this area:  deciduous and evergreen.  Deciduous trees are broad leaf trees that lose their 
leaves in the fall.   
 
In this area we have quaking aspen (deciduous).  Evergreen trees have needles and in this area we have 
ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain juniper. 
 
First: visually check the tree stability.  Any tree weakened by fire may be a hazard.  Winds are normally 
responsible for toppling weakened trees.  The wind patterns in your area may have changed as a result 
of the loss of adjacent tree cover. 
 
If the tree looks stable: 
• 
Visually check for burnt, partially burnt or broken branches and tree tops that may fall. 
 
• 
Check for burns on the tree trunk.  If the bark on the trunk of the tree has been burned off or 
scorched by very high temperatures completely surround the tree’s circumference,  
 the tree will not survive.  This is because the living portion of the tree (cambium) was 
 
destroyed.  The bark of the tree provides protection to the tree during fire.  Bark thickness  
 varies based upon tree species: check carefully to see if the fire or heat penetrated the bark.  
 
Where fire has burnt deep into the tree trunk, the tree should be considered unstable until  
 checked.  
 
• 
Check for burnt roots by probing the ground with a rod around the base of the tree and out 
away from the base several feet.  The roots are generally six to eight inches below the surface.  
If you find that the roots have been burned you should consider this tree very unstable; it could 
easily be toppled by wind. 
 
If the tree is scorched 
A scorched tree is one that has lost part or all of its needles.  Leaves will be dry and curled.  
Needles will be a light red or straw colored.  Healthy deciduous trees are resilient and may 
possibly produce new branches and leaves, as well as sprouts at the base of the tree.  Evergreen 
trees, particularly long-needled trees, may survive when partially scorched.  An evergreen tree 
that has been damaged by fire is subject to bark beetle attack. Please seek professional 
assistance concerning measures for protecting evergreen trees from bark beetle attack.   
 
Seek professional assistance before felling trees near power lines, houses or other improvements.

Residual Smoke In Fire Interior 
 
Smoke may be present on the interior of the fire for several days following containment.  This occurs as 
a result of stumps, roots, and other surface materials being exposed to changing temperatures and wind 
conditions.  Smoke volume from these materials may fluctuate depending on weather conditions.  This 
activity should not pose a risk and smoke will continue to dissipate until materials are fully consumed 
or extinguished by fire crews or weather.

GFFP Monitoring & Research Team 
Adaptive Management Framework 
Discussion Draft 10/01/04 
 
 
The following tables were developed by the Greater Flagstaff Forests Partnership (GFFP) Monitoring and 
Research Team as the initial makings of a monitoring and research plan for the 180,000 acre project area of the 
GFFP (see www.gffp.org).  This framework could be applied to a smaller or larger landscape.  The following five 
broad areas of concern reflect the monitoring needs categories of this partnership, and are divided into fuels 
reduction, ecosystem restoration, social issues, economic health, and institutional health.  This is a very 
broad framework of what areas COULD be monitored within the larger area.  The actual application of what 
SHOULD be monitored within individual projects may be a much smaller, and more focused subset of these 
variables.  Decisions about which goals are desirable for individual projects should be decided by the actual project 
designers (e.g., ID team), and determined based upon very specific project objectives, the specific landscape that 
is affected by the project, the desired conditions for that landscape, and how those desired conditions are proposed 
to be achieved.  Also, an explicit relationship needs to be developed between an analysis of the outcomes of the 
monitoring, and how those outcomes affect future management.

Steps in the Evaluation Process 
Longitudinal Study – Process Evaluation – assess changes over time.  
1. Collect baseline data-establish an understanding of what currently exists; before intervention (treatments or programs). 
2. Collect data at stages as projects progress; either at regular time intervals or after major interventions. 
3. What is the change from pre- to post-test? Analyze the data. 
4. Answer the question – Have goals been met? Establish criteria for successful outcomes. 
5. Recommendations – refine treatments and programs; guide planning and education efforts. 
 
A sustainable community is linked to a sustainable ecosystem. 
Healthy forest Æ Community well-being. 
 
Areas to explore 
1. Insurance industry – current status of homeowner insurance for forest fire loss. 
2. USFS and congressional representatives – determine public pressure thresholds to either suspend or omit restoration prescriptions.

Characteristic & Uncharacteristic– In ecological systems, this refers to whether or not a variable or condition of 
the ecosystem or its parts is included in what is known about its historic or natural range of variability, which may be specific

to a given geographic area. E.g., we know from tree ring studies around Flagstaff that the historic range of variability for low 
intensity fires for the period of 1500 to 1872 was 2-15 years.  Thus fires that currently occur within that range are characteristic 
in frequency (see Fire Regime). 
 
Crown Fire, Active and Passive -- This is a fire that travels from one crown (or treetop) to another in dense stands of trees, 
killing most trees in its path.  However, even in intense crown fires, unburned strips may be left due to powerful, downward air 
currents.  A passive  (or dependent) crown fire relies upon heat transfer from a surface fire burning below the crowns.  An 
active (or independent) crown fire does not require transfer of heat from below the crowns. Source:  Barnes, Burton V., Donald 
R. Zak, Shirley R. Denton, and Stephen H. Spurr.  1997.  Forest Ecology (4th Edition).  John Wiley and Sons, Inc.  New York,

Fire Regime -- A fire regime is defined according to fire characteristics such as intensity, frequency, severity, season, extent, 
duration, behavior, spatial distribution, and type of fire (see Crown Fire).

Surface Fire -- A fire that burns over the forest floor, consuming litter, killing aboveground parst of herbaceous plants and 
shrubs, and typically scorching the bases and crowns of trees. Source:  Barnes, Burton V., Donald R. Zak, Shirley R. Denton, 
and Stephen H. Spurr.  1997.  Forest Ecology (4th Edition).  John Wiley and Sons, Inc.  New York, NY p. 281 (se also Crown 
Fire).
