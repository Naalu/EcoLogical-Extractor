Abstract
Three treatments designed to initiate the process of restoring the surface ﬁre regime and open forest structure of a
southwestern ponderosa pine forest were compared on the Kaibab National Forest along the Grand Canyon’s South Rim. The
treatments were: (1) full restoration (FULL)—thinning trees to emulate stand structure prior to ﬁre regime disruption ca. 1887,
forest ﬂoor fuel treatment, and prescribed burning, (2) minimal thinning (MIN)—removing young trees only around living old-
growth (pre-1887) trees, fuel treatment, and prescribed burning, (3) burn-only (BURN)—representing the current management
policy in Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP), and (4) CONTROL. Each treatment was applied to a 12 ha unit. Compared to
reconstructed 1887 conditions, all study sites were much more dense prior to treatment (94–176 trees/ha in 1887, compared to
783–3693 trees/ha in 1997). However, basal area increases were less striking (12.6–20.3 in 1887, 17.5–27.0 m2/ha in 1997),
reﬂecting past harvest and dwarf mistletoe reduction treatments that removed many large pines. In 2000, 1 year after
treatment, tree densities were reduced to 11, 23, and 37 of pre-treatment levels in the FULL, MIN, and BURN treatments,
respectively. Understory plant communities showed signiﬁcant declines in richness and plant frequency across years, probably
due to a severe drought in 2000 (60% of average precipitation). No differences in plant communities were observed across
treatments, despite the mechanized disturbance associated with tree removal in the FULL treatment. Prescribed ﬁre behavior
(ﬂame length, ﬂaming zone depth) and effects (bole char, crown scorch) were similar across all three burned treatments.
Simulated ﬁre behavior under dry, windy conditions was reduced in all three treatments compared to the control. The FULL
treatment was much less susceptible to crownﬁre due to reduced crown bulk density and crown fuel load and increased crown
base height. Crownﬁre susceptibility of the BURN treatment was only slightly reduced, while the MIN treatment was
intermediate. Compared to the reference conditions of forest structure, the FULL treatment represented the most rapid and
comprehensive restoration treatment, although the residual stand was at the low end of historical density. The BURN treatment
thinned many small trees but had minor effects on crownﬁre susceptibility. Effects of the MIN treatment fell between FULL
and BURN. The experimental treatments may be useful for the creation of defensible ﬁrebreaks near developments, roads, and
boundaries with the FULL treatment, supplemented by MIN and BURN treatments over larger areas.

1. Introduction
The largest stand-replacing forest ﬁres in the
recorded history of the southwest have occurred in 2
of the past 5 years, 1996 (Horseshoe, Hochderffer,
Bridger-Knoll, Dome, Hondo) and 2000 (Cerro
Grande, Outlet, Pumpkin, Viveash). Severe and costly
crownﬁres in western ponderosa pine and related long-
needled pine forests are recognized as a symptom of
underlying ecosystem degradation (Leopold, 1924;
Cooper, 1960; Moore et al., 1999). Contemporary
conditions in virtually all frequent-ﬁre adapted forests
of western North America differ greatly from the
evolutionary environments or range of natural varia-
bility of the biota (e.g. Covington et al., 1994; Arno
et al., 1995a; Minnich et al., 1995; Fule´ and Covington,
1997; Dahms and Geils, 1997; Millar and Wolfenden,
1999), leaving ponderosa forest ecosystems vulnerable
to severe ﬁres, pathogen outbreaks, or non-native
species invasions. As the scale of disturbance size and
intensity increases, forests may cross thresholds to
alternative stable states, such as grasslands or shrub-
lands (Holling, 1992; Romme et al., 1998).
Three distinct approaches exist for dealing with
increasingly severe wildﬁres. First, in some situations
there may not be an underlying ecological problem.
For example, Swetnam et al. (1999) argued that
increasing density in the twentieth century of pinyon
trees at the northern end of its range in Colorado was
not related to ﬁre suppression or overgrazing, but was
caused by northward expansion following long-term
climate warming. Brown et al. (1999) and Shinneman
and Baker (1997) presented evidence that relatively
long ﬁre-free periods (>100 years) and stand-replacing
ﬁres may have occurred in ponderosa pine forests of
the central Rockies and Black Hills prior to European
settlement. In such circumstances there may be no
ecological rationale for management action.
A second approach is to focus on hazardous fuels
with treatments including logging, thinning, chipping
or utilization of slash, and/or prescribed burning
(Kalabokidis and Omi, 1998; Scott, 1998a; McIver
et al., 2001; USDA/USDI, 2000), as well as modiﬁca-
tion of fuels immediately surrounding structures
(Cohen, 1995).
Ecological restoration is a third approach. Reversing
recent deleterious changes and restoring more nearly
natural conditions—that is, conditions characteristic of
the evolutionary environment of an ecosystem—is
central to restoration ecology (Society for Ecological
Restoration, 1993). The paradigm of ‘ecosystem
management’ is linked to ecological restoration
because it takes the best possible understanding of
the structure, function, and composition of intact,
natural ecosystems as a point of reference for manage-
ment strategies (Kaufmann et al., 1994; Landres
et al., 1999). Where evolutionary environments can
be maintained or restored at large enough scales,
principles of conservation biology suggest that these
habitats are most likely to perpetuate native plants and
animals and allow their future evolution (Noss, 1991;
Grumbine, 1992; Moore et al., 1999). Many ecosystem
changes that have already occurred are permanent
(species extinction) or have long-lasting effects (loss of
old-growth trees, atmospheric CO2 increase), leading
some to argue that restoration goals may be misguided
because the evolutionary environment cannot be fully
regained or because the current environment might
have superior qualities (Millar and Wolfenden, 1999;
Tiedemann et al., 2000; Wagner et al., 2000). Certainly
any management regime should proceed from careful
assessment of ecological and social issues. In many
cases there are speciﬁc reasons for managing ecosys-
tems in conditions far removed from the range of
natural variability. But the idea that native species and
communities are most likely to beneﬁt from restoration
of conditions as close as possible to the evolutionary
environment is integral to US resource policy (i.e.
ecosystem management) and law. Under the Endan-
gered Species Act, for example, it is not acceptable to
permit the extinction of a native species under the
argument that a ‘‘superior’’ exotic species is available
instead. This link between conservation of native
biological diversity and restoration of native habitats
underscores the broad philosophical goal of a restora-
tive approach, ‘‘not to revive the past . . . but to secure
our future by restocking a dangerously depleted global
inventory of natural areas’’ (Clewell, 2000, p. 217).
While a laudable goal, testing of speciﬁc treatment
alternatives is essential.
In ponderosa pine forests, restoration treatments
started with the reintroduction of surface ﬁre (Weaver,
1951; Biswell, 1972; Covington and Sackett, 1984).
Fire alone was usually insufﬁcient to restore the open,
crownﬁre-resistantforeststructurecharacteristicofpre-
European settlement conditions (Sackett et al., 1996).

Therefore, recent restoration methods have focused
on tree thinning as well as burning, guided by detailed
dendroecological and historical reconstructions of
pre-disruption conditions (Arno et al., 1995b; South-
west Forest Alliance, 1996; Covington et al., 1997;
Scott, 1998a; Moore et al., 1999; Lynch et al., 2000).
The National Park Service was a pioneer among US
resource management agencies in recognizing and
attempting to reverse the deleterious effects of ﬁre
exclusion (Pyne, 1982; Sellars, 1997). Since the
1970s, Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP) has
intensively pursued restoration of the natural role of
ﬁre in its approximately 38,500 ha of ponderosa pine,
ponderosa pine/Gambel oak, and mixed conifer forest.
Despite many successful burns, intense ﬁre behavior
due to dense forest conditions led to several costly
escaped ﬁres. Reviews of the fuel situation by Davis
(1981) and the Interagency Task Force (Nichols et al.,
1994) reached similar conclusions, recommending
aggressive treatment of accumulated fuels and an
expansion of prescribed burning. The 1994 review
suggested using mechanical treatments in limited
circumstances to thin ‘‘understory trees which have
grown into the area following ﬁre exclusion’’ in order
to ‘‘assist in restoration of natural ﬁre regimes,
ecosystem stability, and protection of mature overs-
tory trees’’.
In 1997, we developed a cooperative project with
Grand Canyon and the Tusayan District of the Kaibab
National Forest to test several ecological restoration
approaches on small areas. All treatments included
restoration of surface ﬁre but varied in tree thinning
and fuel treatments.
2. Methods
2.1. Study area
The experiment was conducted on a 50 ha site in the
Tusayan Ranger District of the Kaibab National Forest
on the border of GCNP. The elevation was approxi-
mately 2290 m with gentle slopes, averaging 7%. The
forest habitat type is ponderosa pine/Gambel oak
(Larson and Moir, 1987). Soils in GCNP adjacent to
the site are classiﬁed as ﬁne, smectitic, mesic, Vertic
Paleustalfs and Haplustalfs, clay soils weathered from
calcareous sandstone parent material (Lindsay, 2000,
personal communication). Average precipitation is
36.8 cm,
including
average
annual
snowfall
of
177.5 cm, at Grand Canyon Village, approximately
2097 m elevation and 20.4 km NW of the study area
(GCNP, 1992). Temperatures range from an average
maximum of 29 8C in July to 8 8C in January.
Precipitation varied substantially in the speciﬁc
measurement years of this study: the water year (1
October–30 September) for 1997 recorded 43.3 cm
precipitation (117% of average) while the water year
for 2000 recorded only 22.4 cm precipitation (61% of
average).
Human inﬂuence in the Grandview area, as
evidenced by prehistoric cultural resources, was likely
linked to the ponderosa pine/pinyon–juniper ecotone
where a diversity of valued plants and animals would
have been attractive to both nomadic and sedentary
groups (Hevly, 1988). The region around the study site
included the ﬁrst Euro-American developments at
Grand Canyon: Hance and Hull cabins, the Grandview
trail and mine, several early tourist camps and the
Grandview Hotel. Euro-American settlement was
associated with the cessation of the frequent forest
ﬁre regime after 1887, livestock grazing, predator
control, tourism, mining, and logging for construction
materials and mine timbers. Recent management
impacts included the Grand Canyon mistletoe control
project of 1949–1952 in which infected trees were
pruned or thinned along a broad swath of the South
Rim (Lightle and Hawksworth, 1973). Past harvest
included individual tree selection and group selection
methods focusing on mature ponderosa pine trees. The
site was not grazed by livestock since prior to 1997 and
was fenced in 1999 as part of this experiment. Heavy
use by mule deer and Rocky Mountain elk was
observed in the drought year of 2000, possibly due to
the placement of a temporary water reservoir as a
ﬁreﬁghting contingency just north of the study site.
2.2. Treatment design
Four treatments were developed with input from
Park Service and Forest Service staff as well as public
comments: (1) a full ecological restoration treatment
(FULL), designed to emulate the structure of pre-
settlement forests, treat fuels, and restore ﬁre in
prescription; (2) a minimal thinning treatment (MIN),
designed to reduce ﬁre hazard and facilitate prescribed
P.Z. Fule´ et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 170 (2002) 19–41
21

ﬁre; (3) a burn-only treatment (BURN); (4) a control
treatment (CONTROL). These treatments cover a
range of alternatives in taking the ﬁrst steps toward
restoring ecosystem characteristics. The experiment
was originally designed in three blocks, each con-
taining a replicate of the four treatments ðN ¼ 12Þ.
Pre-treatment measurements were carried out on all
three blocks, the Kaibab National Forest site described
here and two GCNP sites. The Grand Canyon sites
were not treated due to obstacles in the environmental
assessment process. As a result, the experimental
design was reduced to a before–after control-impact
(BACI) design (Stewart-Oaten et al., 1992) with
N ¼ 4.
The reference condition selected for the FULL
thinning was the pre-settlement pattern of tree species
composition and spatial arrangement (White, 1985;
Fule´ et al., 1997; Covington et al., 1997; Mast et al.,
1999). Living pre-settlement trees of all species were
retained. In addition, wherever evidence of remnant
pre-settlement
material
was
encountered
(snags,
stumps, logs), several of the largest post-settlement
trees of the same species within 9.1 m were retained as
replacements. If suitable trees were not found within
9.1 m, the search radius was extended to 18.2 m. Each
remnant was replaced with 1.5 trees (i.e. three
replacements per two remnants) if the replacements
were 40.6 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) or larger,
otherwise each remnant was replaced with 3 trees.
The MIN treatment focused on protecting living old-
growth trees from crownﬁre. To a limited extent, the
MIN was also expected to reduce tree competition
(Biondi, 1996). Around each old tree, young trees were
thinned to interrupt the continuity of crown fuels both
horizontally and vertically, converting the fuel com-
plex in the immediate vicinity to a savannah type
(roughly ﬁre behavior fuel model 2, Anderson, 1982)
instead of a forest type (fuel model 9). The thinning
radius ranged from 12 to 18 m, proportional to the
height of the focal tree. The thinned area was
anisotropic with the longest radii to the SW and/or
downhill on sloping sites, in order to providemaximum
protection from the prevailing SW wind direction and/
or from downslope ﬁres. Within the thinning area,
cutting nearest the old tree was similar to the FULL
treatment, with nearly all young trees removed. Toward
the outer edges of the thinning radius, the thinning was
feathered into the unthinned surrounding stand.
The presence of ponderosa pine trees severely
infested with dwarf mistletoe affected the thinning
designs. Hawksworth and Geils (1990) estimated the
mean time to death of 50% of infected trees at Grand
Canyon as 7–25 years for dwarf mistletoe rating
(DMR) of 5–6 on a scale of 0–6. We chose to retain all
pines of pre-settlement origin, irrespective of mis-
tletoe infestation. But since post-settlement pines with
a DMR of 5 or 6 were highly likely to die in the near
future, they were not considered acceptable replace-
ment trees.
In both the FULL and MIN treatments, accumulated
forest ﬂoor fuels were raked approximately 30 cm
away from the base of the boles of old-growth trees in
order to minimize cambial girdling by ﬁre (Sackett
et al., 1996). The BURN treatment was intended to
imitate current management practices at GCNP so
fuels were not raked from tree boles.
2.3. Field methods
Treatments were randomly assigned to four forest
units, each nominally 12 ha in size (actual range 11.9–
13.4 ha). Twenty permanent monitoring plots were
established in each unit (total N ¼ 80 plots) between
20 August and 3 November 1997. Plots were located
on a 60 m grid, corresponding to a measured experi-
mental area of 7.2 ha per treatment unit. Plot centers
were established with tape and compass from sur-
veyed reference points, such as section corners. Global
positioning systems were used to geo-reference plot
grids. Centers were permanently marked with iron
stakes and slope and aspect were recorded. Photos
were taken to plot center from 11.28 m NE.
Overstory trees taller than breast height (137 cm)
were measured on a 400 m2 (11.28 m radius) circular
ﬁxed-area plot. Species, condition (living or snag/log
classes (Thomas et al., 1979)), diameter at breast
height (dbh), and a preliminary ﬁeld classiﬁcation
of pre-settlement or post-settlement origin, were
recorded for all live and dead trees over breast height,
as well as for stumps and downed trees that surpassed
breast height while alive. Potentially pre-settlement
ponderosa pine trees were identiﬁed based on size
(>40 cm diameter at ‘‘stump height’’ (dsh), 40 cm
above ground level) or yellowed bark (White, 1985).
Trees of all other species, oaks, pinyons, and junipers,
were considered as potentially pre-settlement if
22
P.Z. Fule´ et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 170 (2002) 19–41

dsh >20 cm. All potentially pre-settlement trees, as
well as a random 10% subsample of other trees, were
cored with an increment borer at 40 cm above ground
level to determine age and past size, as described
below. Diameter at stump height was recorded for all
cored trees. All overstory trees were marked with
aluminum tags at breast height and tree locations were
mapped.
Regeneration (trees below breast height) and shrubs
were tallied by condition class and by three height
classes (0–40, 40.1–80, and 80–137 cm) on a nested
100 m2 (5.64 m radius) subplot. The point-line inter-
cept method (line transect) was used to collect her-
baceous and shrub data on all plots. Plant species,
substrate, and overstory canopy cover (vertical projec-
tion of canopy taller than 137 cm) were recorded every
30 cm along a 50 m line transect oriented upslope with
25 m above and 25 m below the plot center. Species
were also recorded within 5 m to either side of each
transect, forming a 10 m wide belt transect on each
plot. Dead woody biomass and forest ﬂoor material
were measured on a 50 ft planar transect in a random
direction from each plot center.
Trees were marked for retention and thinning was
carried out under a Forest Service contract. Total costs
(marking, thinning, fuel raking, fencing, and pre-
scribed burning) were US$ 748/ha in FULL and US$
566/ha in MIN. The prescribed ﬁre costs alone (BURN
treatment) averaged US$ 44/ha (Johnson, 2000,
personal communication).
Forest ﬂoor fuels were re-measured on 1 September
1999, prior to burning. The treatment units were
burned with strip headﬁres on the afternoons of 18 and
20 October 1999. Winds ranged from 0 to 7 km/h,
wind direction was primarily from the north and east,
and relative humidity varied from 14 to 28%. Average
ﬂame lengths were 25–120 cm (corresponding to
ﬁreline intensities of 13–383 kW/m (Agee, 1993))
with maximum ﬂame lengths reaching 2.5–3 m
(1884–2799 kW/m). Flaming zone depths ranged
from 0.25 to 1.8 m. Fires burned primarily on the
surface, but some passive crownﬁre (torching) was
observed in the BURN unit. Plot 1 in the CONTROL
unit was unintentionally burned with high tree
mortality. This plot was removed from analysis.
After burning, fuels were re-measured on 5
November 1999. Burn severity codes (ﬁve categories,
unburned to complete consumption) were recorded
at each forest ﬂoor measurement point. All variables
on all permanent plots were re-measured during 4–
8 August 2000. In addition, total height, crown base
height, crown scorch (height and percent), bole char
(minimum and maximum height), and dwarf mistletoe
rating (0–6) were measured on all trees. Burn severity
codes (four categories, unburned to completely bur-
ned) were assigned to vegetation and substrate (litter,
rock, soil, wood, scat, bole) at each intercept point
along the line transects.
2.4. Laboratory, statistical, and modeling analysis
Increment cores were surfaced and visually cross-
dated (Stokes and Smiley, 1968) with local tree-ring
chronologies. Rings were counted on cores that could
not be crossdated, especially younger trees. Additional
years to the center were estimated with a pith locator
(concentric circles matched to the curvature and den-
sity of the inner rings) for cores that missed the pith
(Applequist, 1958). Fuel loadings were calculated from
the planar transect data (Brown, 1974; Sackett, 1980).
Pre-settlement forest structure was reconstructed at the
time of disruption of the frequent ﬁre regime, 1887,
following dendroecological methods described in
detail by Fule´ et al. (1997). Brieﬂy, size at the time
of ﬁre exclusion was reconstructed for all living trees
by subtracting the radial growth measured on incre-
ment cores since ﬁre exclusion. For dead trees, the date
of death was estimated based on tree condition class
using diameter-dependent snag decomposition rates
(Thomas et al., 1979). To estimate growth between the
ﬁre exclusion date and death date, we developed local
species-speciﬁc relationships between tree diameter
and basal area increment ðr2 ¼ 0:450:90Þ. An
analogous process of growth estimation was used to
estimate the past diameter of the small proportion of
living pre-settlement era trees for which an intact
increment core could not be extracted due to rot.
Comparisons of forest variables on the 20 sample
plots between treatments and over time (pre- and post-
treatment) were made with repeated-measures analysis
of variance (ANOVA) using Systat (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, 1998). Alpha level was 0.05. Variables
were square-root transformed where necessary to meet
ANOVA assumptions of normality and homoskedas-
ticity. Following a statistically signiﬁcant ANOVA
result, treatment means were compared with a post-hoc
P.Z. Fule´ et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 170 (2002) 19–41
23

Tukey’s procedure. Collapsing a replicated experiment
to a single realization of each treatment substantially
limited statistical inference because of the lack of
knowledge of within-treatment error, an undesirable
but common occurrence in environmental ﬁeld studies
(Eberhardt and Thomas, 1991). Signiﬁcant differences
mean that the populations in each unit differ but
treatment cause-and-effect cannot be inferred in a
statistical sense. In a practical sense, however, it is
logical to infer that intentional treatments, such as
cutting trees and burning, caused direct effects such
as declines in tree density or consumption of fuels. A
much weaker level of inference would be appropriate
for assessing more subtle alterations or those where
mechanisms are less apparent.
Herbaceous community data analysis included
calculations of plant and substrate frequencies, species
richness, Simpson’s index (SI, richness weighted by
frequency), height classes, and cumulative species
curves. PC-ORD (MjM Software, Gleneden Beach,
OR, 1999) was used for community analyses, includ-
ing species area curves, cluster analyses, ordinations
(non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS)), and
indicator species analysis.
Fire behavior was modeled with the Nexus Fire
Behavior and Hazard Assessment System (Scott and
Reinhardt, 1999). Crown biomass was estimated with
allometric equations for foliage and ﬁne twigs of
ponderosa pine (Fule´ et al., 2001), Gambel oak (Clary
and Tiedemann, 1986), and pinyon and juniper (Grier
et al., 1992). Crown volume was estimated by the
averages of maximum tree height (top of the canopy)
and crown base height (bottom of the canopy). Crown
bulk density was calculated as crown biomass divided
by crown volume. Crown base height values measured
in the CONTROL treatment in 2000 were used to
estimate pre-treatment values for all stands. Since the
majority and presumably the largest of the pre-
settlement era trees had been previously logged on
the study site, pre-settlement stand height (20 m) and
crown base ðr2 ¼ 0:450:90Þ height (4.88 m) values
were estimated at the 90th percentile of trees >10 m
tall in 1997.
Fire weather extremes representing the 90th and
97th percentiles of low fuel moisture, high winds, and
high temperature were calculated from 34 years of
data on the Kaibab National Forest (Tusayan weather
station) using the FireFamily Plus program (Bradshaw
and Brittain, 1999). Weather values were calculated
for the entire ﬁre season (23 April–16 October) as well
as for June, historically the month with the most severe
ﬁre weather (Table 1). Fire behavior information from
two of the two largest wildﬁres in northern Arizona,
the 1996 Horseshoe (May) and Hochderffer (June)
ﬁres, was used to estimate wind gusts during periods
of extreme ﬁre behavior. Sustained winds of 51 km/h
were commonly observed on these ﬁres.
‘‘Average’’ stand conditions fail to represent the
dispersed fuel ladders that facilitate the transition to
the crown in real ﬁres, making simulated ﬁres difﬁcult
to crown even though real ﬁres crowned under similar
or even less severe conditions. Taking the variability of
the data into account to simulate more realistic ﬁre
behavior, we ranked the crown base height data by
quintiles (20% categories) and compared ﬁre behavior
and treatment effects on both the stand averages and
the susceptible quintiles.
Growth of retained trees for 40 years following the
treatments was simulated with the forest vegetation
simulator (FVS, Van Dyck, 2000), central Rockies/
southwestern ponderosa pine variant. Canopy fuels
were calculated for the stands in 2040 as described
above.
3. Results
3.1. Changes in tree structure
In 1887, at the end of the pre-settlement frequent-
ﬁre regime, forest structure was relatively open (93.8–
176.3 trees/ha, 10.6–20.3 m2/ha), with ponderosa pine

making up 84–95% of basal area (Table 2). By 1997,
all the study units were signiﬁcantly more dense. The
units differed in tree structure prior to treatment, with
tree densities ranging from 782.9 to 3692.5 trees/ha
and basal areas from 17.5 to 27.0 m2/ha (Tables 2 and
3). Ponderosa pine dominated all sites, making up 53–
91% of trees/ha and 74–80% of total basal area.
Treatments had rapid and substantial effects on tree
structure (Fig. 1). In FULL treatment, tree density was
reduced to 11% of pre-treatment density, from 1337.5
to 153.8 trees/ha. Basal area declined to 35% of pre-
treatment levels, from 17.5 to 6.2 m2/ha. Sixty-nine
percent of the tree density decline was due to tree
thinning and 31% to mortality from ﬁre or other
causes. The MIN treatment reduced density to 23% of
pre-treatment density, from 2935.0 to 683.8 trees/ha.
Basal area declined to 59% of pre-treatment levels,
from 22.5 to 13.4 m2/ha. Fifty percent of the tree
density decline was due to tree thinning and 50% to
mortality from ﬁre or other causes. The BURN
treatment reduced density to 37% of pre-treatment
density, from 3692.5 to 1383.8 trees/ha. Basal area
declined to 80% of pre-treatment levels, from 27.0 to
21.7 m2/ha. All of the tree density decline in the
BURN treatment was due to mortality from ﬁre or
other causes. The untreated CONTROL site changed
by less than 4% in tree density and less than 1% in
basal area during the same period.
Relative dominance by ponderosa pine was reduced
slightly in the MIN and BURN treatments, declining a

maximum of 7% in tree density and 3% in basal area.
In contrast, the FULL treatment resulted in numerical
dominance by Gambel oak. Ponderosa pine made up
only 28% of post-treatment tree density, although the
species remained dominant in basal area (68%).
Canopy cover did not differ signiﬁcantly between
treatments in 1997, ranging from 39.5 to 52.7%. After
the treatment, the canopy cover in both the FULL and
MIN treatments was signiﬁcantly lower (Table 4).
Tree regeneration density declined substantially in
the CONTROL as well as the other treatments
(Table 5), but neither the treatment nor time factors
were found to be statistically signiﬁcant. Regeneration
in all size classes was dominated by highly variable
patches of Gambel oak sprouts, but ponderosa pine
seedlings were relatively better represented in taller
size classes. Density of regeneration dropped an
average of 81% (range 70–86%) in the tallest class and
79% (range 68–88%) in the middle class. Only in the
shortest regeneration class was a difference observed
among treatments: the CONTROL, MIN, and BURN
densities all declined (average 47%, range 34–65%),
but the FULL treatment increased by 166% due to a
large increase in oak sprouts. Even after the decline
observed in 2000, all treatments retained over 1500
seedlings or sprouts per hectare.
No signiﬁcant differences were found in any crown
scorch or bole char variables across the three burned

to 4.8 m with maxima 65–142% higher. Scorched
crown volume averaged 22.6–29.5%, but maximal

Dwarf mistletoe rating (DMR) of ponderosa pine
trees, measured only post-treatment, was signiﬁcantly
highest in CONTROL (average 1.5 out of 6). The three
treated units had low DMR values (FULL ¼ 0:3,
MIN ¼ 0:1, BURN ¼ 0:01) that did not differ sig-
niﬁcantly.

The predominant trend throughout the understory

richness and frequency between 1997 (pre-treatment)
and2000(post-treatment).Thedeclineswereconsistent

and statistically signiﬁcant over time but were incon-
sistent and rarely signiﬁcant between treatments,
suggesting that the change was due primarily to dro-
ught, herbivory, or other non-treatment factors.
Litter and plants were the most frequent ground
covers recorded along herbaceous transects (Table 7)
in both 1997 and 2000. Post-treatment litter frequency
increased between 19 and 37%, in place of the plant
cover that was found before treatment. Plant cover
decreased between 21 and 34% after treatment. In
2000, bare soil increased (0.1–6.0%) in all treatments
except the CONTROL. The increase in bare soil was
lower in the MIN treatment (0.1%) than in the FULL
treatment (6.0%).
Between 51 and 58 additional species not recorded
on line transects were found on belt transects in both
1997 and 2000 (Table 8). Species richness in the
CONTROL treatment areas was signiﬁcantly higher
than the other three areas in 1997, before experi-
mentation began, and over all treatments, years, and
methods of measurement. The largest 1997–2000
decreases were observed in the BURN treatment (17–
32 species) and the CONTROL (15–19 species). The
lowest decrease was found in the FULL treatment (5–
13 species). SI, a widely used dominance measure of
diversity, ranged from 2.0 to 11.8 with averages
ranging from a low of 5.63 in the BURN treatment to a
high of 5.84 in the MIN treatment prior to treatment
(Fig. 2). SI decreased signiﬁcantly in all treatments
from 1997 to 2000. Post-treatment SI ranged from 0 to
0.75 with averages ranging from a low of 0.11 in the
BURN treatment to a high of 0.19 in the FULL

CONTROL plots in both years (1997 and 2000) and

plots
(Table 9). Except in the MIN plots, percent nativity
increased post-treatment. For both years and all
treatments, Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) was the
most frequent non-native species on line transects (up
to 7%). On belt transects, the most abundant non-
native species recorded were B. tectorum, Taraxacum
ofﬁcinale (common dandelion), Trifolium repens
(white clover), and Verbascum thapsus (common
mullein).
Community-wide comparisons with NMDS showed
differences over time but no differences between treat-
ments either before or after treatment for either plant
frequencies or species presence/absence (data not
shown). There was very little variation between treat-
ment in burn severity of either substrates (litter, duff,
wood) or vegetation. Average burn severity codes fell
between 3.07 and 3.95 where ‘‘4’’ denotes unburned.
3.3. Fuels
Surface fuels were similar at all units before
treatment (Table 10). Forest ﬂoor depth averaged
2.4 cm (range 1.76–3.13 cm). Small woody fuels
(1–100H (where 1H denotes 1 h timelag, 2H denotes
2 h timelag, etc.) timeclass, <7.62 cm diameter)
averaged 4.30 Mg/ha (range 2.91–5.00 Mg/ha) and
large woody fuels (1000H) averaged 10.34 Mg/ha
(range 8.16–13.86 Mg/ha). After thinning, forest ﬂoor
depth increased by 28 and 61% in FULL and MIN.
Total woody fuels increased by 360% in FULL and
decreased by 62% in MIN. Burning reduced forest
ﬂoor depth 41–78% and woody fuels by 10–43%. Fuels
were relatively stable between the 1999 burn and the
2000 re-measurement. Substantial variability between
measurement periods was observed in the untreated
CONTROL and standard errors were commonly
50% of the means throughout the fuel data.
Variation in crown bulk density (foliage and ﬁne
branches) prior to treatments ranged from 0.0501 to
0.0662 kg/m3 (Table 11), relatively less than the
variation in basal area or tree density (Tables 2 and 3).
Crown bulk density was reduced 61% in the FULL
treatment, 42% in the MIN treatment, and only 19.5%
in the BURN treatment (Table 11). Pre-treatment
crown fuel loads varied from 6.6 to 10.3 Mg/ha. After
thinning and burning, crown fuels were reduced 66%
in the FULL treatment, 48% in the MIN treatment, and
27% in the BURN treatment. Changes in the
CONTROL crown bulk density and fuel load were
<1% in the same period. Crown base heights were not
measured before treatment, but they averaged at least
1.3 m higher than the CONTROL after treatment. All
three treated units were similar in average crown
base height in 2000 (range 0.32 m) but the lowest
quintile of crown base height was more variable (range
0.85 m).
3.4. Potential ﬁre behavior
The purpose of the modeling analysis was not to
accurately estimate the behavior of a real ﬁre but rather
to compare the treatment alternatives. Model results
should always be applied cautiously. There are a
number of uncertainties in the models integrated in
Nexus, reﬂecting the complexity of ﬁre behavior
(Scott, 1998b). Fire behavior models are highly

sensitive to crown base height, wind speed (or wind
reduction factor), fuel moisture, and surface fuel model
variables (1H fuel loading, herbaceous fuels, surface
area-to-volume ratio, fuel bed depth). We held slope
constant at 7% (the average slope of the experimental
sites) but similar fuels on steeper slopes would exhibit
higher ﬁre intensity. The actual numerical values used
for model inputs produced realistic predictions but the
behavior of real ﬁres in these stands would be affected
by variability in fuels and weather, roads, meadows,
surrounding forest fuels, landscape topography, and
suppression activities.
Under the modeled conditions (Table 1), all treat-
ments were susceptible to relatively intense ﬁre
behavior: ﬂame lengths 7.2–12.3 m, surface ﬁre rate
of spread 27.5–35.6 m/min, and heat/area ranging
from 12.7 to 21.0 kJ/m2 (Table 12). The FULL
treatment caused a major reduction in potential ﬁre
behavior as modeled in the Nexus software. The MIN
treatment had an intermediate effect and the BURN
treatment was least effective in altering ﬁre character-
istics. Crownﬁre behavior outputs included the torch-
ing index (wind speed required to initiate passive
crownﬁre) and the crowning index (wind speed
required to sustain active crownﬁre). Torching is
primarily inﬂuenced by crown base height and
crownﬁre is primarily inﬂuenced by the closely related
variables of crown fuel load and crown bulk density
(Table 12). Prior to treatment, passive crownﬁre
(torching) was predicted for all sites under the modeled
conditions, burning 59–83% of the crown volume, and
the crowning index was only 4.4–16.6 km/h higher
than the modeled 51 km/h wind speed, indicating that a
small increase in wind speed could sustain active
crownﬁre. After treatment, under identical moisture
and weather conditions, all sites still supported passive
crownﬁre but the FULL treatment had greatly reduced
ﬁre intensity: ﬂame length declined by 80% and crown
volume burned dropped by 81%. Flame lengths
declined by 57 and 49% and the crown volume burned
decreased by 57 and 47% in the MIN and BURN
treatments, respectively. The predicted crown volume
burned in FULL after treatment was only 11%, in
contrast to 30% in MIN and 44% in BURN. Crowning
indices increased by 96% in FULL, 48% in MIN, and
only by 17% in BURN. After treatment, a wind of

64.7 km/h could still sustain crownﬁre in BURN but a
wind of 126.9 km/h would be required for active
crownﬁre in FULL.
Simulated ﬁres in the reconstructed pre-settlement
stands were projected to remain on the surface
(Table 12), but this result is dependent on crown
base height, a variable that is difﬁcult to estimate for
the reconstructed forest. However, crown bulk density
for the reconstructed 1887 forest was low, averaging
0.0248 kg/m3 (range 0.0195–0.0338 kg/m3). The max-
imum crown bulk density in 1887, 0.0338 kg/m3, was
nearly 70% lower than the average 1997 value of
0.0570 kg/m3 (Table 11). Accordingly, the crownﬁre
indices projected for the pre-settlement stands were
high, ranging from 89.4 to 131.9 km/h.
By 2040, 40 years after treatment, FVS simulations
showed that retained trees in all four treatments
increased in crown fuel load by 52% in CONTROL
(12.1 Mg/ha), 88% in FULL (4.2 Mg/ha), 118% in
MIN (9.2 Mg/ha), and 82% in BURN (13.6 Mg/ha).
4. Discussion
Causal inferences are limited because the experi-
ment was unreplicated. These circumstances are often

encountered in ecosystem experiments, especially in
the complex policy and funding environment of
research on public lands. Comparisons are mean-
ingful, however, because the treatment alternatives
were tested against a control site and because pre-
treatment measurements were taken, analogous to the
BACI design of Stewart-Oaten et al. (1992). Since the
treatments were not subtle, distinct effects associated
with each treatment were already apparent in the ﬁrst-
year data. A meta-analysis approach integrating
related experimental treatments across the broader
region will eventually provide the most complete
picture of ecological restoration effects (Arnqvist and
Wooster, 1995).
None of the treatments tested here could immedi-
ately reverse long-standing ecological degradation,
such as the loss of old-growth trees. Rather, they
represent differing levels of management intervention
aimed at initiating the process of restoring pre-
degradation ecosystem characteristics. All require a
long-term commitment to prevent future degradation
(e.g. overharvesting, overgrazing, excessive recrea-
tional use), maintain the surface ﬁre disturbance
regime, and continue monitoring and evaluation of the
sites. Furthermore, patterns seen in the ﬁrst growing
season following treatment will change over time.
Additional mortality is expected to become evident,
especially for conifers (Sackett et al., 1996). On the
other hand, some trees considered dead in 2000 due to
crown scorch may survive (Dieterich, 1979). Espe-
cially given the drought conditions in 2000, understory
plant response was probably not indicative of future
successional trends.
Forest structural conditions were restored most
closely within the range of natural variability by the
FULL treatment. Tree density and basal area were
actually reduced to the low end of the 1887 dis-
tribution, nearly one standard deviation below the
1887 mean. Basal area reconstructed in 1887 averaged
13.0 m2/ha on the FULL, compared to only 6.9 m2/ha
in 2000 (Table 2). Forest density in 2000 was about
150% of the reconstructed 1887 density, but current
pine density of 42.5 trees/ha was lower than the
historic density (60.0 trees/ha; Table 3). Since the
thinning prescription called for retaining all living old-
growth trees and multiple replacements for dead trees
of pre-settlement origin, the low density of pines was
not an intentional outcome of the FULL treatment.
Rather, it resulted from the heavy mistletoe infestation
encountered in potential replacement trees. The FULL
site had a mean of only 35 pine seedlings/ha in 2000.
Monitoring will assess whether the regeneration
density proves sufﬁcient for maintaining pine in the
unit. If not, natural regeneration can be supplemented
with planted seedlings of local provenance. The MIN
treatment reduced basal area to 13.4 m2/ha, very close
to the historic 12.6 m2/ha, but tree density of
683.8 trees/ha remained nearly seven standard devia-
tions above the 1887 level (113.8 trees/ha). The mean
density in 2000 was more than double the maximum
density in 1887. The BURN treatment thinned about
2300 small-diameter trees/ha but the site remained far
above historic levels for both basal area and density.
Canopy cover in BURN was unaffected by burning
(Table 4).
The understory plant community declined consis-
tently in plant cover and species richness from 1997 to
2000 across the spectrum from the undisturbed
CONTROL treatment to the mechanically harvested
FULL treatment. Even in the ﬁrst growing season
following disturbance, any deleterious understory
effects associated with burning, thinning, or equip-
ment operation were not distinguishable against the
background of drought effects. Burn severity, crown
scorch, and bole char were also essentially the same
across all three burned treatments.
Concern over the initial disturbance associated with
thinning and burning treatments has led some to call
for staged, multiple entries to accomplish restoration
(e.g. Southwest Forest Alliance, 1996). In theory, a
series of minimally disturbing treatments could reduce
undesirable
impacts
associated
with
understory
damage from machinery and heat injury from burning
heavy slash fuels. This hypothesis was not supported
by the present study, at least in the ﬁrst post-treatment
year, since no substantive differences were observed in
understory response or heat effects across the range of
treatments.
Simulation of 40 years of stand growth following
treatment was consistent with expectations. Of all
treatments, only FULL remained within the pre-
settlement range of variability for crown fuel loading
in 2040. Individual trees were predicted to be largest
in FULL in 2040 (quadratic mean diameter, all
species averaged 33.5 cm), followed by CONTROL
(24.9 cm), MIN (24.6 cm), and BURN (20.6 cm). It is
36
P.Z. Fule´ et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 170 (2002) 19–41

more difﬁcult to estimate crown bulk density in 2040
since crown base height is unknown. If crown base
height and stand height in 2040 were assumed to be
2.3 and 18.4 m, respectively (equal to the 2000 control
unit values), then crown bulk density would be:
CONTROL 0.0754 kg/m3, FULL 0.0258 kg/m3, MIN
0.0568 kg/m3, and BURN 0.0844 kg/m3. Again, only
the FULL treatment remained within the pre-settle-
ment range of variability for crown bulk density.
Under a wildﬁre scenario similar to that in Table 12,
therefore, all the treatments except FULL would be
highly susceptible to crownﬁre by 2040.
Changes over time will affect the treated sites in a
variety of ways. Oaks are expected to resprout quickly
while pines establish in sporadic favorable years
(Savage et al., 1996; Fule´ et al., 1997), but repeated
burning is expected to limit tree regeneration to safe
sites (sensu White, 1985) in all treatments. Future
growth of established trees is anticipated to respond to
competition, with individual tree growth rates for
pines and oaks in FULL likely to be several times
higher than in BURN (Kolb et al., 1998; Onkonburi,
1999; Ffolliott et al., 2000). However, increased tree
biomass in FULL will be spread over a greater canopy
volume as trees grow in height. As long as new
regeneration remains regulated by ﬁre, FULL is likely
to remain within the range of natural variability in
basal area, density, and crown bulk density. Since MIN
and BURN are already above the historic levels for
these variables even immediately after treatment, they
are expected to remain high since repeated surface
burning kills relatively few established trees (Sackett
et al., 1996).
The economic efﬁciency of these treatments cannot
be fully assessed because of their small scale.
However, it is reasonable to assume that even for a
larger operation, per-hectare costs would remain
highest in FULL due to the greater amount of tree
marking, thinning and slash, followed by MIN, with
BURN remaining relatively low. The cost ratios of the
experimental treatments were approximately 17:13:1
for FULL:MIN:BURN. Costs can also be compared in
terms of the relative beneﬁts achieved. For example, if
costs are calculated per kilometer increase in crown-
ﬁre index, the costs per treatment are US$ 12.00/km in
FULL, US$ 19.70/km in MIN, and US$ 4.70/km in
BURN, a ratio of approximately 2.5:4:1, making
FULL more economically favorable than MIN with
respect to crownﬁre hazard. The BURN treatment
remained lowest in cost, but the total gain in crownﬁre
index was only 9.3 km/h, not enough to make a
meaningful difference in the event of a severe wildﬁre.
A detailed analysis of economic differences in terms
of all the possible variables that may be of ecological
or social importance is beyond the scope of this paper.
Such an assessment would be likely to include factors
such as (1) ‘‘costs’’ of differential ﬁre hazard and
understory recovery potential following the initial
treatment, (2) ‘‘costs’’ of remaining outside the range
of natural variability, if restoration to within RNV was
a management objective, and (3) costs of future
thinning, snag creation, or fuel treatment if the initial
MIN or BURN treatment was deemed insufﬁcient.
4.1. Implications for research and management
Each treatment alternative had distinct advantages
and disadvantages that may inﬂuence management
decisions about their broader application. The FULL
treatment provided a rapid and effective initial
restoration intervention to reduce crownﬁre hazard
and create conditions expected to be suitable for
recovery of understory diversity and productivity, with
minimal ecological ‘‘costs’’ in terms of soil and
understory disturbance. Rapid change to the forest
has beneﬁcial effects in terms of immediate crownﬁre
protection, economic efﬁciency, maximizing the
opportunity for understory response, and eliminating
the need for future thinning entries and concomitant
disturbance. Negative consequences of rapid change
could include physiological or environmental shock to
residual trees (e.g. sunscald, windthrow). Such effects
were not observed in similar thinning treatments near
Flagstaff, AZ for either old-growth or second-growth
ponderosa pine (Kolb et al., 1998; Feeney et al., 1998).
Another concern might be excessively fast alterations
to habitat for some wildlife species (Wagner et al.,
2000). Effects on mobile species are difﬁcult to
measure at the scale of this experiment, although a
concurrent study of small mammal communities on the
study site is in progress (Chambers, in press). At Mt.
Trumbull, AZ, Waltz and Covington (1999) found
increased butterﬂy abundance and diversity following
treatments similar to FULL. Finally, the FULL treat-
ment required road access and use of heavy machinery.
These factors weigh against FULL in roadless
P.Z. Fule´ et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 170 (2002) 19–41
37

areas, wilderness, or sites where machinery and noise
are undesirable (e.g. noise disturbance to Mexican
spotted owls during the breeding season). Depending
on the level of risk from crownﬁre, temporary
disturbance may be deemed an acceptable tradeoff
for improved ﬁre protection and economic efﬁciency.
Of the two agencies involved in this study, virtually
all of the ponderosa pine/Gambel oak forestlands of
the Kaibab National Forest are practically and legally
accessible for the FULL treatment. The value of
treatment by-products such as logs or chips could be
used to defray costs. However, the ecosystem man-
agement mandate of the Forest Service does not
necessarily center on restoration of natural habitats
(Kaufmann et al., 1994). In contrast, GCNP has good
road access only on the South Rim. The North Rim,
where the bulk of forestlands occur, has few roads and
is proposed for wilderness designation. Deriving value
for treatment by-products, whether through sale or
trade for treatment work, is against current policy. But
the park does have a mandate to ‘‘conserve the scenery
and the natural and historic objects and the wild life
therein . . . by such means as will leave them unim-
paired . . .’’ (Sellars, 1997, p. 38), a directive con-
sistent with ecological restoration (Moore et al.,
1999). Initial application of a treatment like FULL
within the park could include protection of develop-
ments and restoration along roads or boundaries,
creating protected buffers for dispersed non-mechan-
ized thinning and prescribed burn blocks.
The BURN treatment killed many small-diameter
trees, reduced fuels, and raised crown base height.
However, basal area, canopy cover, and crownﬁre
hazard were not greatly reduced because the majority
of trees >20 cm in diameter survived. Any differences
in tree mortality due to not raking accumulated fuels
away from tree boleswillprobably take several years to
become apparent (Sackett et al., 1996) or may not be
signiﬁcant (Kaufmann, 2000). Excessive rapidity of
forest change is not a concern for BURN. Instead, the
fundamental issue is that burning alone may be
insufﬁcient to restore forests conditions to the natural
range of variability. Process modeling of long-term
forest change under repeated burning has led to varying
results, depending in large part on model assumptions
about ﬁre behavior and ﬁre-caused mortality. For
example, Miller and Urban (2000) suggested that
relatively intense prescribed ﬁres could restore forest
structure over several centuries in the Sierra Nevada,
while a model applied by Covington et al. (in press)
indicated that an Arizona forest remained dense
indeﬁnitely under a prescribed ﬁre regime. The present
study cannot resolve the question, but it does show that
the BURN treatment site remained dense and vulner-
able to crownﬁre after initial burning. Since the canopy
cover
and
large tree
structures were
relatively
unchanged, the potential for density-dependent growth
declines (Biondi, 1996) and mortality (Mast et al.,
1999) of old-growth trees will probably continue and
prospects for future understory recovery appear
limited. Continued application of the BURN treatment
on both park and forest lands appears likely.
The fact that the MIN treatment was intermediate to
FULL and BURN in almost every respect suggests
that the treatments fall along a continuum of forest
conditions rather than representing three qualitatively
different environments. The implication of continuity
is that the properties of other intermediate treatments,
not tested in this experiment, could reasonably be
predicted based on the effects observed here. This
hypothesis awaits testing at this and other sites over
time. While the MIN site remained outside the range
of natural variability in tree structure, substantial gains
in reducing canopy closure and crownﬁre hazard were
achieved. Since the thinning was centered on old-
growth trees, the ﬁre protection may be disproportio-
nately valuable in terms of allowing old trees to
survive wildﬁre or intense prescribed burning. The
MIN treatment could be carried out with machinery
but does not require mechanized equipment, making it
more useful in the park’s unroaded lands and forests
managed as proposed wilderness.
Extending from this initial experiment, we recom-
mend that Kaibab National Forest and GCNP consider
applying treatments similar to FULL and MIN, with
appropriate site-speciﬁc modiﬁcations, to additional
sites. A ﬁrst step would be implementation of the
companion experimental blocks within the park.
Another useful approach would be to apply either
the FULL or MIN treatments in sites currently being
thinned to reduce ﬁre hazards around developed areas
of the park. Over time, variants of these treatments or
similar ones being tested in southwestern forests
(Covington et al., 1999; McIver et al., 2001) could be
combined to create landscape-scale burn blocks
buffered by restored edges, within which ﬁre could
38

be applied consistently and safely. For example, the
concept of defensible shaded fuelbreaks accompanied
by area treatments outlined by Agee et al. (2000) could
be applied in the park by using a FULL-type treatment
around developments and along roads and borders,
with MIN- and BURN-type treatments applied to
larger adjacent areas. On the forest, large-scale
thinning could be pursued more rapidly and econom-
ically, protecting resources on both sides averaged
33.5 cm of the boundary.
