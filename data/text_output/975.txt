Effects of Alternative Silvicultural Treatments on
Cable Harvesting Productivity and Cost in Western
Washington
Damon S. Hartley and Han-Sup Han
Increasingly, alternative silvicultural methods have been considered to meet the demand for nontimber values such as visual quality and biodiversity in the
Paciﬁc Northwest. The successful implementation of these alternative silviculture treatments requires careful consideration of economics and operational
efﬁciencies in timber harvesting. This study used detailed time study and shift-level data to assess the effect of alternative silvicultural treatments on the
production and cost of cable harvesting in western Washington. Four silvicultural treatments were examined: clearcut, two-age, patch cut and thin, and group
selection. Silvicultural treatments greatly affected the production and cost of timber harvesting, especially in felling and yarding processes. The average yarding
cycle time (3.74 minutes/cycle) in the clearcut unit was shorter than those in other partial cutting treatment units because there were no residual trees to work
around and higher harvest volumes per acre, compared with the partial cut units. The average tree size greatly affected yarding cost: the clearcut unit had
the second-highest yarding cost ($52.38/thousand board feet [mbf]) because of the smallest piece size (69.6 board feet/piece). Stump-to-truck cost for this
study ranged from $70.49/mbf for the patch cut and thin to $120.19/mbf for the group selection. Carriage types and yarding direction also had an impact
on yarding productivity.

F
orest management practices in the Paciﬁc Northwest are
changing to reﬂect increased public demands for addressing
nontimber values such as structural and biological diversity as
well as aesthetics and wildlife habitats (Curtis et al. 1998, Reutebuch
et al. 2002). These demands often call for implementing alternative
silvicultural practices (i.e., partial cutting) with less-intensive harvest
of trees (Johnson 2002, Reutebuch et al. 2002) and more emphasis
placed on the ecological perspective (Keegan et al. 1995). Partial
cutting treatments are not new to forest management in the Paciﬁc
Northwest, but land managers and contract loggers often voice con-
cerns about increased logging costs and operational requirements
resulting from the protection of environmental values while produc-
ing timber (Arnott and Breese 1997). This type of management is
complicated further by the fact that there are no commonly accepted
procedures that dictate how partial harvest treatments are imple-
mented, administered, or evaluated (McNeel and Dodd 1996).
Successful implementation of the alternative silvicultural treat-
ments is, in part, dependent on the operations being economically
efﬁcient while meeting the landowner’s objectives for the stand
(Coulter 1999). Potential ﬁnancial returns are important criteria for
forest managers to consider when planning a timber harvest. Gen-
erally, clearcutting is accepted as being less expensive than partial
cutting. Higher harvesting productivity or low harvesting cost often
is associated with clearcuts because workers and machinery do not
have to maneuver around residual trees, machines have to move less
because of higher volumes removed per area, and hooking times are
shorter because of higher concentrations of downed timber (Kellogg
et al. 1996a, 1996b, Howard et al. 1996).
Harvesting productivity commonly decreases with partial cut-
ting because care must be taken to minimize damage to residual trees
and equipment travel times are longer when trees are spaced farther
apart. However, other factors such as an increase in average tree size
may make up for productivity losses incurred due to reduced harvest
intensity per acre (Kluender et al. 1998). Planning and layout is an
integral part of timber harvesting and the cost (dollars per acre) of
planning and harvest layout is inﬂuenced by the amount of harvest
volume per acre and silvicultural treatments. The planning of a
partial harvest may take anywhere from two to seven times longer
than planning a clearcut because of the amount of detail needed in
laying out the skyline corridors, with the result that planning costs
associated with partial cutting are higher than those associated with
clearcutting (Kellogg et al. 1998).
Another challenge in the Paciﬁc Northwest is that the topogra-
phy is often too steep (more than 35%) to be harvested effectively by
ground-based harvesting systems. Although ground-based harvest-
ing systems can work on slopes of up to 50%, their production is
considerably diminished as the upper slope limit is approached
(Conway 1982). Cable harvesting systems often are used to harvest
timber in steep terrain, but cable harvesting costs are more sensitive
to alternative silvicultural treatments than ground-based harvesting
systems. For example, Daigle (1992) found that the cost of tractor
logging in partial harvests was between 0 and 16% greater than the
cost of logging clearcuts. In contrast, cable logging costs for partial

ABSTRACT

cutting were 19 and 4% above clearcutting costs. He suggested that
several factors contributed to the difference in the increase in cable
logging costs, including the large amount of time spent during cor-
ridor changes and the large labor inputs required for yarding activ-
ities (i.e., typically three to four people are directly related to yarding
activities in a cable logging). Increased number of landing and road
changes and smaller turn sizes also contribute to higher cable log-
ging costs in a partial cutting (Hochrein and Kellogg 1988). Eco-
nomic concerns become greater when alternative silvicultural treat-
ments are implemented using cable systems because these systems
have higher costs than ground-based harvesting systems in a partial
harvesting (Daigle 1992).
Implementing alternative silvicultural systems in coastal conifer
stands of the Paciﬁc Northwest using cable systems is being consid-
ered more frequently, and there is a need to enhance our knowledge
of how to efﬁciently and economically implement alternative har-
vesting practices. The objectives of this study were to compare the
productivity and cost of cable harvesting among four different silvi-
cultural treatments and to identify what factors inﬂuence them.
Study Area and Methods
Four different silvicultural treatments were located on a 242-ac
study area in the Capitol State Forest in Olympia, Washington
(latitude, 46.85° N; longitude, 123.15° W). The stands were pri-
marily (89–97%) stocked with Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menzesii),
but also supported small components of western hemlock (Tsuga
heterophylla), western red cedar (Thuja plicata), red alder (Alnus
rubra), and bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum). The average dbh of
the merchantable (i.e., conifer) species was 19 in. The elevation of
the site is approximately 500 ft above sea level and the slope ranged
from 15 to 57%. All cutting units were located outside of riparian
management areas and were not required to leave buffers. Table 1
summarizes the mean site conditions for each of the four silvicul-
tural treatments. These treatments include
•
Clearcut. Even-aged prescription that removed 100% of trees in
the harvest unit. Because clearcutting is the traditional and most
common harvesting practice in this area, we have chosen to use
it as the reference treatment for this study. We will use this
reference as the basis of all comparisons between silvicultural
treatments.
•
Two-age. Uneven-aged prescription, in which approximately
15 trees/ac are retained until the next rotation.
•
Patch cut and thin. Uneven-aged prescription that removed
about 20% of the overstory, in patches of 1.5–5 ac with thin-
ning in between the openings, resulting in a stand that contains
ﬁve separate age classes. The patch cut and thinning operations
were not separated to analyze the overall effect of this type of
treatment.
•
Group selection. Similar to patch cut and thin except the open-
ings are limited to less than 1.5 ac that are scattered over the
harvest unit.
One logging contractor conducted all four silvicultural treat-
ments. The contractor was familiar with the use of cable harvesting
systems in partial cutting operations and he had been performing
partial harvest using these systems for 10 years. Felling was done
either by a Timbco 445-D feller-buncher with a Quadco (Prince
George, BC, Canada) hot saw head for ﬂat or moderate slopes (less
than 40%), or by a contract faller using a Stihl 064 chainsaw
(Oceana West Industrial Park, Virginia Beach, VA) with a 34-in.
bar for steep slopes (more than 40%). Both manual and mechanical
felling methods were used in the group selection and patch cut, with
the mechanical felling used in the thinning sections and manual
felling was used in the clearcut patches. The clearcut unit was felled
mechanically, and the two-age unit was felled manually (Table 2).
Yarding was done using a Washington 78SL swing yarder
(Trican Machinery, Ltd., New Westminster, BC, Canada) run by a
crew of four with 5–30 years of experience: a yarder operator, a
rigging slinger, and two choker-setters. The yarder had a 47-ft tower
and was capable of yarding distances of 1,800 ft. The yarder was
used in different conﬁgurations (standing and running skyline sys-
tems and uphill and downhill yarding) and with an assortment of
carriages to facilitate yarding of the harvest units (Table 3). The
equipment conﬁgurations were determined by the contractor, in
accordance with his views on the most productive setup for the site.
During yarding three carriage types were used: Eagle Eaglet motor-
ized clamping carriage, a mechanical slack pulling (MSP) carriage
and a grapple carriage. The MSP carriage and the grapple carriage
were used in downhill yarding situations in one of the clearcut
patches with a running skyline setup. For material smaller than
17 in., large-end diameter, whole trees were yarded to the landing
where trees were processed with an excavator-based Cat 320D with
a Fabtec (Menomnee, MI) processing head in all units. All material
larger than a 17-in. small-end diameter was processed at the stump
using a chainsaw. A Link-Belt heel boom loader was used to load tree
length logs onto the trucks at landing.

A detailed time study was performed on the yarding phase of the
operation for each silvicultural unit between May and August of
2002. All the productive elements and delays were measured to
develop predictive equations for average cycle time for yarding op-
erations. The productive yarding cycle was divided into six ele-
ments: outhaul, lateral out, hooking, lateral in, inhaul, and unhook-
ing. The elemental times in seconds were collected using a Husky
fex21 ﬁeld computer (Lexington, KY), with the Time Study Data
Logger program (Itronix, Spokane Valley, WA) (Wang 2001).
Along with the elemental times, independent variables also were
collected and related to the average yarding cycle time models.
The independent variables collected were yarding distance, lateral
distance (except for when grapple yarding was used in the patch cut
and thin unit where lateral distance was not collected), number of
pieces per cycle, carriage type, and yarding direction. Delays in
the productive cycle were recorded also in three categories: (1)
operational—downtime during the cycle such as hang-ups, losing
logs, decking problems, and others; (2) mechanical—downtime
caused as a result of machine failure; and (3) personal—downtime
caused for other than mechanical or operational reasons.
Shift-level data are the daily production information of a ma-
chine or person per shift recorded by each operator at the end of the
day throughout the operation. A time log was kept on all the ma-
chines for the entire harvest so that the detailed information could
be compared with the daily production, to make sure that there were
no errors made. No detailed time study data were collected for
felling, processing, and loading. Shift-level data were used to esti-
mate production rates for these activities. The daily production data
for each piece of equipment were used to derive a cost per unit of
volume for each piece of machinery on each harvesting unit.
The data collected in the detailed time studies were entered into
a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, where an initial screening of data was
performed. Outliers were screened and removed from the data set if
they were more than 3 SDs from the mean. After the outliers were
removed, the data were transferred to SAS version 8.02 (SAS 2001)
where multivariate ordinary least squares regression analysis was
preformed to develop models of delay-free cycle time. Tree and log
size information was calculated using the preharvest cruise and scal-
ing data. The scaling data were obtained from the mill to which the
logs were taken, where the logs were scaled according to the westside
Scribner log rule. Logs were identiﬁed by truck scale tickets and were
able to be differentiated by sale unit. The scaling data were used to
determine average volume per piece for each unit and also the
weighted average was used to determine average piece size for the
sale.
Machine rates were calculated for each machine that was used in
the harvesting of each of the study units. The machine rates were
calculated using the method outlined by Miyata (1980). Several
assumptions were made to calculate machine rates, and they are
summarized in Table 4. The machine rates for all machinery are
listed in Table 5. For this study the yarder had the highest total cost
per scheduled machine hour (SMH) because of high labor cost
associated with a four-person crew.
Results and Discussion
Felling, Processing, and Loading
Mechanical felling productivity varied greatly among silvicul-
tural treatments because of the differences in density of residual
standing timber and felling methods (Table 6). Mechanical felling
was used in the clearcut unit as well as the thinning sections of the
patch cut and thin and group selection units. The average produc-
tion rates of the mechanical felling were not statistically different in
the patch cut and group selection units with production rates of
32.4 trees/SMH and 28.0 trees/SMH, respectively, and 65.7
trees/SMH in the clearcut. Mechanical felling costs were 176%
higher in the partial cutting areas ($17.74/thousand board feet
[mbf]) than in the clearcut unit ($6.42/mbf). The cost per mbf was
calculated by multiplying the trees per hour production rate by the
average standing tree volume and dividing the machine rate for the
felling system by that product. Manual felling productivity was ap-
proximately 12.01 trees/SMH (or $15.78/mbf) in the clearcut sec-
tions of the patch, group selection, and two-age treatments. It was
expected that manual felling production would have decreased also
because of the care necessary to avoid hang-ups and undue damage
to the residual stand (Kellogg et al. 1996b). Felling productivity,
however, was not affected because of the high fraction of trees felled
in the sections where manual felling was used. In the calculation of
felling cost, an average tree volume of 263.41 board feet (bd ft) was
used, which was estimated from the presale cruise.
Processing productivity was consistent throughout all the silvi-
cultural treatment units because processing occurred independently
from the yarding activities. There were no processing production

data collected from this study, and we used the processing produc-
tion information from a previous study that used a similar processor
in comparable tree sizes (Coulter 1999). The processing production
rate used in the cost calculation was 11.45 mbf/SMH, which re-
sulted in a unit processing cost of $10.99/mbf. Log trucks were
loaded from a cold deck, by a loader dedicated to loading only,
resulting in a consistent production in loading for all the silvicultural
treatment units studied. On average, ﬁve trucks were loaded per day
with an average payload of 4.276 mbf/truck load. The hauling dis-
tance to the mill was 250 mi one way, and each truck made only one
trip per day. This resulted in a loading cost of $25.03/mbf.
Skyline Yarding
Yarding Cycle Time
The shortest average cycle time was observed in the clearcut unit
(3.33 minutes), followed by the patch cut (4.23 minutes) and two-
age (4.44 minutes), and the group selection (4.88 minutes) had the
longest average cycle time (Figure 1, Table 7). The outhaul time was
relatively similar throughout the treatments, with signiﬁcant differ-
ences between the two-age and patch cut; and the clearcut and group
selection were caused by the differences in the external yarding dis-
tance of each unit.The time spent pulling cable laterally was signif-
icantly higher in the two-age unit (46.61 seconds/cycle; P 
0.0001). This unit had a steeper ground slope than the other units
and a large amount of logging slash on the ground, which resulted
from processing large trees at the stump. The slash interfered with
the choker-setter’s movement. Hooking time was the shortest for
the clearcut and the two-age units (clearcut, 42.88 seconds/cycle;
two-age, 47.69 seconds/cycle. The abundance of timber on the
ground, timber mechanically felled and bunched (clearcut), and
large trees (two-age) attributed to the quick hooking time.
Time for lateral-in to the carriage was inﬂuenced by residual trees
and the felling method. The two-age and group selection units,
which required the greatest amount of yarding through standing
timber, had signiﬁcantly higher cycle times for lateral-in than
clearcut and patch cut (Tukey’s honestly signiﬁcant difference
[HSD], P  0.001). The logs and trees in the group selection and
two-age units had to be worked around residual trees during the
lateral–cable-in process, slowing the process of returning the cable
to the carriage. In the patch cut, the trees in the single tree selection
thinning area were mechanically felled and placed in bunches near
the skyline corridors to facilitate the lateral-in process. In the areas
that were grapple yarded the lateral distance was recorded as 0 ft;
thus, there was no lateral-out or lateral-in time. The residual trees in
the two-age and group selection units also caused longer times for
the inhaul process because the logs had to be pulled through a
residual stand. Unhooking time was similar across the treatments
with the exception of the group selection. Although all units used
the use of electronic chokers, the unhooking time for the group
selection unit was longer because of mechanical problems with the
chokers. To facilitate data analysis, the mean unhooking time for all
the turns recorded, excluding the unhooking times for the group
selection, was used to provide an estimate of unhooking time for the
group selection unit.
Regression models for delay-free cycle time were developed, us-
ing the common independent variables of lateral yarding distance,
yarding distance, and number of pieces per cycle for all the harvest-
ing units (Table 8). For the models all the coefﬁcients were signiﬁ-
cant except for the coefﬁcient on pieces per cycle in the group
selection model, which had a value of P  0.351, and the coefﬁcient
on lateral distance in the two-age model, which had a value of P 
0.144. The coefﬁcient for pieces per cycle was positive and statisti-
cally the same in magnitude, except that the patch cut coefﬁcient
was signiﬁcantly higher than the clearcut. Similarly, the coefﬁcient
for the lateral distance variable was positive with statistically the
same magnitude, except that the patch cut variable was signiﬁcantly
higher than the two-age unit. In the patch cut model, dummy vari-
ables were used to examine the effect of carriage type and position of
the yarder (uphill versus downhill yarding). The coefﬁcients that
were signiﬁcant for the patch cut model in addition to pieces per
cycle, lateral distance, and yarding distance were the coefﬁcients for
the grapple carriage and yarding direction. Both coefﬁcients were
found to have negative signs, which signify that both the grapple
carriage and the uphill yarding resulted in lower cycle times than
downhill yarding and slack pulling carriages. The combined model
was developed based on all the data from the different silvicultural
units and resulted in a general model for skyline yarding productiv-
ity on this study, including dummy variables to account for differ-
ences in silvicultural treatment, carriage type, and position of the
yarder.
Delays
Delays caused signiﬁcant differences in overall cycle time (Figure
2, Table 9). During our ﬁeld observations, we found that mechan-
ical malfunctions of the old yarder constituted the majority of the
total delay time, accounting for 43 and 85% of the delays for the
two-age and patch cut units, respectively. The patch cut unit had

some large mechanical problems with the yarder; in addition, the
carriage type was changed three times. Consequently, over 50% of
the average total cycle time for the patch cut unit was made up by
delays. Twenty-seven percent of the average cycle time for the patch
cut was attributed to mechanical delays. The clearcut and group
selection units had no appreciable mechanical downtime observed
in this study. Operational delays such as hang-ups with residual trees
and deck management at landings were highest in the two-age unit
(7.33% of the observed time), compared with 1.63% in clearcut,
0.43% in patch cut, and 0.26% in group selection units.
In the overall operation, road changes (moving the skyline
cables to the next corridor) accounted for between 11 and 20% of
the total observed operating time. The time spent to prerig the
next corridor was not included in the road changes because it was
done independently from yarding activities. Pulling the strawline
was treated as a working delay only if it interfered with yarding
activities. Less time was spent on road changes in the clearcut
unit than any of the other units (Figure 3). Because there were no
standing trees between the corridors in a clearcut, the cables did
not have to be pulled all the way back to the yarder before moving
to the next corridor. The shorter yarding distances in the clearcut
and group selection units contributed to fast road change times.
The fast road change times and the low delay times in the clearcut
resulted in the highest utilization rate (productive machine hour
[PMH]/SMH, 87%). In contrast the two-age unit had the lowest
utilization (73%) because of increased operational delays (i.e.,
hang-ups) and high percentage of road change time. The patch
cut and group selection units had utilization rates of 76 and 85%,
respectively.
Carriage Type and Yarding Direction
In the patch cut unit, three different types of carriage were used
during the yarding operation and this affected yarding production.
The grapple carriage required signiﬁcantly (Tukey HSD, P 

0.0001) lower average cycle time than other carriages, and the mo-
torized and MSP carriage had similar average cycle times (Table 10).
Although the cycle times for the grapple carriage were lower, the
production rate with that carriage was low because the grapple car-
riage could yard only 1 tree/cycle. The motorized and MSP carriages
yarded between 1 and 7 logs or trees/cycle. The grapple carriage
would have to reduce its average cycle time by 1.16 minutes to equal
the productivity of the other types of carriages. Felling pattern also
affected the efﬁcient use of carriages. When the trees were felled
perpendicular to the contours of the hill, it was difﬁcult for the
grapple carriage to be quickly positioned on a log. If the trees had
been felled parallel to the contour it would have been more condu-
cive for the use of a grapple carriage.
This study showed that position of the yarder at either the top or
the bottom of the slope had a statistically signiﬁcant (P  0.0001)
impact on yarder productivity. The average cycle time for uphill

yarding was on the average approximately 37 seconds shorter than
the average cycle time for downhill yarding. This equated to approx-
imately an extra 16 turns/day, or an additional 4.18 mbf/day, as-
suming an average number of 2.6 logs/turn and an average log
volume of 100.6 bd ft. A lower harvesting cost might have resulted
if access to landings at the top of the slope were built relatively
inexpensively at a low environmental impact.
Yarding Cost
Yarding costs ranged from $37.19 to 76.51/mbf, with the patch
cut and thin having the lowest cost per unit volume (Table 11). The
number of pieces per turn was consistent for all units at approxi-
mately 2.5 trees/turn, except when a grapple carriage was used. The
grapple carriage yarded 1 tree/turn. Although the clearcut unit had
the fastest average cycle time, it had the second-highest cost as it was
observed in this study because the average volume per piece was
lowest (69.6 bd ft/piece) in the clearcut unit. The average piece sizes
in the patch cut and two-age treatment were nearly twice that of the
clearcut (Table 11).
The stand conditions varied between silvicultural treatment
units (Table 1). To determine the effect of silvicultural treatments

on the harvesting cost, we standardized the variables that were con-
tained within the parameters of the developed models. On this
standardized basis, the clearcut unit had the lowest cost of
$46.10/mbf (Table 12). The group selection treatment had the
highest cost because of the highest average time per cycle and the
second-lowest volume per piece. This unit had a relatively low har-
vest intensity (10.7 mbf/ac), which required increased time for mov-
ing and setting up the yarder and minimizing residual stand damage.
When all the phases (felling, yarding, processing, and loading) of
harvesting were considered, using the standardized harvesting vari-
ables based on potential production, the clearcut had a stump-to-
truck cost of $81.99. The group selection treatment had the highest
stump-to-truck cost of the four treatments, 31% higher than the
clearcut. In between were the two-age treatment and the patch cut,
which were 22 and 13% higher, respectively (Table 13). Potential
production is used to illustrate more clearly the differences between
silviculture treatments by removing the effects of downtime. This
follows the pattern that was seen in the yarding cost because yarding
was the most costly of the harvesting cost components.
Conclusion
The difference in silvicultural treatments greatly affected the cost
and production of harvest operations, especially in felling and yard-
ing production. In silvicultural treatments that had higher levels of
residual trees and had those residuals uniformly dispersed through-
out the cutting blocks (i.e., no large openings), the production of
both felling and yarding operations was observed to decline due to
the increased care needed to avoid damage to residual trees. This
study clearly showed that there was an increase in felling cost for
both manual and mechanical felling methods as the amount of
residual timber increased. Silvicultural treatment had its biggest
impact on yarding productivity and cost because of increased time
for skyline road changes and yarding cycles. As expected, the stand
with the lowest number of residual trees per acre resulted in the
shortest amount of time spent for road changes.
Average tree size, yarding direction, carriage type, and felling
patterns all interacted with silvicultural treatment to inﬂuence total
harvesting cost. Because of different initial stand conditions or
smaller average tree diameters clearcut did not result in the lowest
costs, as would be expected. In this study the patch cut had the
lowest yarding cost ($24.73/mbf) and lowest total stump-to-truck
cost ($70.49/mbf), and the clearcut had the third-lowest yarding
cost ($52.38/mbf) and second-lowest total stump-to-truck cost
($89.22/mbf). This difference was caused by mainly the differences
in tree size of the two units. As the size of the logs increase, yarding
productivity was signiﬁcantly increased without impacting on over-
all average yarding cycle time.
The type of carriage used should be matched to felling methods
and operational conditions. The data showed that the grapple car-
riage was less productive than the other yarding systems used, espe-
cially when trees were felled perpendicular to the contour. The
fellers assumed that a motorized or MSP carriage was going to be
used. Instead, the yarding contractor decided to use a grapple car-
riage and spent much time to cast or pivot the grapple carriage to

The yarding productivity was estimated using the individual regression equation for each treatment.
This comparison was done based on uphill yarding with a motorized carriage and the standardized values (yarding distance, 360.03 ft; lateral distance, 32.45 ft; pieces per turn, 2.56; and volume
per piece, 100.6 bd ft). The hourly machine rate for yarding was $146.14/SMH or $208.77/PMH.

hook the logs. Had the timber been felled along the contour rather
than perpendicular to the contour, the grapple carriage would have
been much more efﬁcient and the ﬁndings might have been differ-
ent. Yarder location was another factor that affected the total cost of
harvest. When yarding downhill, yarding productivity was notably
reduced because of the care needed to keep the logs under control
while moving them downhill.
Under a scenario of uniform initial conditions among the stands,
we found that the clearcut, as expected, would return the lowest
logging cost, followed by the two-age and patch cut harvest, with a
group selection harvest being the highest cost alternative. Harvest-
ing cost increased as tree retention levels increased (i.e., decrease of
the number of trees removed per acre) and as the retained trees were
more interspersed throughout the cutting unit (i.e., large openings
[1.5 ac] were not used).
