Summary
 
1.
 
Many management prescriptions are based on ecological hypotheses; evaluating empirical
support for these hypotheses can improve management. There has been considerable dispute about
the potential response of the northern goshawk to three management-driven forest structures in
ponderosa pine forests of the south-western United States: (i) the structure recommended by US
Forest Service’s goshawk guidelines, designed to increase the abundance of 14 goshawk prey species
and thus beneﬁt goshawks; (ii) preferred foraging habitat as suggested by empirical evidence that
goshawks forage selectively in areas with abundant large trees and dense canopy closure, rather than
areas of highest prey abundance; and (iii) presettlement (i.e. prior to Euro-American settlement)
structure characterized by clumps of large trees, canopy closure < 40% and dense herbaceous
understorey, which could have negative effects on goshawks.
 
2.
 
To evaluate empirical support for hypotheses that goshawk reproduction is affected by each of
these three forest structures, we measured forest structure in a 1215-ha nest-centred circular area in
each of 13 goshawk breeding areas on the Apache–Sitgreaves National Forest, Arizona. The breeding
areas were selected to span the full range of productivity (ﬂedglings per year monitored) over the
previous 9-year period.
 
3.
 
Forest structure had a moderate effect on goshawk productivity (
 
r
 
2
 
 
 
≤
 
 0·46). Contrary to
expectation, goshawk productivity decreased with increasing similarity to the goshawk guidelines.
 
4.
 
Goshawk reproduction was not correlated with resemblance of the breeding area to preferred
foraging habitat or resemblance to presettlement forest conditions.
 
5.
 
Synthesis and applications
 
. Because the goshawk guidelines may not improve goshawk
reproduction, the Forest Service should reconsider its decision to apply the guidelines to most
forested lands in Arizona and New Mexico. Managers should evaluate empirical support routinely
for the major ecological hypotheses that underlie forest prescriptions.

Introduction
 
The northern goshawk 
 
Accipiter gentilis
 
 L. is a species of
concern in Arizona (Arizona Game and Fish Department,
undated) and a US Forest Service sensitive species in Region
3 (US Forest Service 1993a). The goshawk population in the
western United States was evaluated for listing under the
Endangered Species Act in 1992 and 1998 (US Fish & Wildlife
Service 1998). Concern over the status of the goshawk prompted
the US Forest Service to develop management recommendations
for National Forests in Arizona and New Mexico (Reynolds
 
et al
 
. 1992; referred to hereafter as ‘goshawk guidelines’).
In 1996, the goshawk guidelines were incorporated into
amendments of all Forest Plans in these two states (US Forest
Service 1995, 1996). The amendments require the goshawk
guidelines to be implemented on all Forest Service forestlands
that are not managed for Mexican spotted owls (
 
Strix occidentailis
lucida
 
). A fundamental assumption of the goshawk guidelines
is that the ‘goshawk is a forest habitat generalist that uses a
variety of forest types, forest ages, structural conditions, and
successional stages’ (Reynolds 
 
et al
 
. 1992: 1). Reasoning that
‘if goshawk populations are a barometer of their prey popu-
lations, then forest management should feature prey habitats’,
Reynolds 
 
et al
 
. (1992) prescribed a forest structure that

should provide abundant populations of 14 prey species.
Following Reynolds 
 
et al
 
. (1992), we use the term forest
structure to include descriptors such as tree density, diameter
distribution, canopy closure, numbers of snags and logs and
basal area.
Greenwald 
 
et al
 
. (2005) provide an alternative concept of
ideal goshawk habitat. Their review of habitat use studies
in North America (11 of 12 published after the goshawk
guidelines) suggests that goshawk foraging locations within
their home ranges are characterized by many large [> 40·6 cm
diameter at breast height (d.b.h.)] trees and dense (> 40%)
canopy closure, but that goshawks do ‘not select stands with
the greatest prey abundance’ (Greenwald 
 
et al
 
. 2005: 120).
Although none of the studies reviewed by Greenwald 
 
et al
 
.
(2005) hypothesized that goshawk reproduction or survival
would be highest in goshawk breeding areas with many large
trees and dense canopy closure, this is a reasonable hypothesis
from these observations.
In these same south-western forests, ecological restoration
of ponderosa pine (
 
Pinus ponderosa
 
) and pine-oak (
 
Quercus
 
species) forests has been proposed to reverse changes to forest
structure and function caused by a century of livestock
grazing, ﬁre suppression and timber harvest, and to reduce
the risk of stand-replacing wildﬁres (Covington & Moore
1994). Accordingly, managers in the region are proposing
treatments to restore conditions that prevailed prior to Euro-
American settlement. Compared to current forest structure,
these presettlement conditions are characterized by lower
basal area, stem density and canopy closure, and a larger
fraction of the landscape dominated by large trees (Fulé,
Covington & Moore 1997; Mast 
 
et al
 
. 1999; Fulé 
 
et al
 
. 2002;
Waltz 
 
et al
 
. 2003). Concern that presettlement forest structure
will affect goshawk populations adversely is one of the main
issues raised by environmental advocacy groups opposed to
implementation of restoration treatments (US Fish and
Wildlife Service 1998).
Managers would beneﬁt from an empirical assessment of
how these three alternative forest structures would affect
goshawks. Although direct experiments would be ideal,
managers would have to assign randomly a statistically useful
number of goshawk territories to required treatments and
controls, and it would take decades to implement treatments
and monitor goshawk response. We chose a less direct but
more expedient approach by correlating goshawk reproduction
with similarity of goshawk breeding areas to each of these
three alternative forest structures.
Several previous studies have related stand characteristics
to goshawk reproduction (Crocker-Bedford 1990, 1995; Ward,
Ward & Tibbets 1992; Patla 1997; Finn, Marzluff & Farland
2002). Although each of these studies provided useful
information about how reproduction varies with one or more
forest trait, no study addressed these particular forest structures
directly or compared empirical support for alternative
hypotheses. Furthermore, these studies were limited to
relatively short monitoring periods: 3–7 years per territory
(Patla 1997) or 1–3 years per territory (all other studies).
Monitoring reproduction for > 3 years is appropriate because
goshawk reproduction in western North American landscapes
ﬂuctuates widely among years, probably driven by changes in
weather and prey abundance (Kennedy 1997; Krüger &
Lindström 2001; McClaren, Kennedy & Dewey 2002). One
possibility is that forest structure affects reproduction only
during years of high ﬂedging success, other years being so
poor that the inﬂuence of habitat is obscured. For example,
Bloxton (2002) observed that goshawk reproduction virtually
ceased in La Niña years (years of low precipitation in western
North America driven by cold ocean temperatures in the
equatorial Paciﬁc), overriding habitat effects. Alternatively,
forest structure might inﬂuence reproduction only in years of
poor reproduction; for example, Krüger & Lindström (2001)
observed that in good years all goshawk territories had high
productivity with little variation among breeding areas.
To address these issues, we related goshawk nest productivity
over a 9-year period to forest structure in landscapes around
13 goshawk breeding areas in ponderosa pine and pine–oak
forests on the Apache–Sitgreaves National Forest in Arizona.
Our objective was to assess how reproductive success of
goshawks varied with similarity of goshawk breeding areas to
three alternative forest structures (goshawk guidelines,
preferred foraging habitat, presettlement conditions) over a
time span that included a range of climatic conditions typical
of the South-western United States.
 
Methods
 
STUDY
 
 
 
AREA
 
We studied goshawks on the Black Mesa and Lakeside Ranger
Districts of the Apache–Sitgreaves National Forest in east-central
Arizona. The study area is part of the Mogollon Plateau, an area
dominated by basaltic and limestone type soils that forms the
uplifted southern edge of the Colorado Plateau and is dominated
by ponderosa pine. Elevations in the study area ranged from 1768
to 2417 m (mean 2134 m). In these breeding areas, silverleaf oak
(
 
Q. arizonica
 
), pinyon pine (
 
P. edulis
 
), alligator juniper (
 
Juniperus
deppeana
 
) and Utah juniper (
 
J. osteosperma
 
) frequently co-occurred
with ponderosa pine, especially at lower elevations or on south-
facing slopes. At higher elevations and in steep canyons, co-dominant
species were Douglas fir (
 
Pseudotsuga menziesii
 
), white fir (
 
Abies
concolor
 
), and aspen (
 
Populus tremuloides
 
). Gambel oak (
 
Q. gambelii
 
)
and New Mexico locust (
 
Robinia neomexicana
 
) were common
understorey tree species throughout. Annual precipitation at the
nearest weather station (Show Low Airport, 2102 m elevation)
averaged 39·9 cm during 1993–2002, with driest years in 2002
(24·5 cm) and 1996 (31·4 cm), and relatively wet years in 1993 (53·4 cm),
1994 (50·7 cm) and 1997 (46·6 cm).
Our research activities occurred within a 1215-ha circle (radius
1967 m) from the geographical centroid of each area’s known
nest locations. To avoid the implication that these circles correspond
exactly to goshawk territories, we use the term ‘goshawk breeding
areas’ to refer to these circular areas.
None of the goshawk breeding areas in our study experienced
timber harvest in > 8% of the breeding area (mean 2·8%, range
0–7·6%) during 1993–2002. Thus we believe that the goshawk
reproduction we observed was not affected by disturbance or other
short-term effects of timber harvest.

MONITORING
 
 
 
GOSHAWK
 
 
 
REPRODUCTION
 
During 1993–2002, the Arizona Game and Fish Department, US
Forest Service (USFS) and Northern Arizona University collaborated
to monitor northern goshawks in the study area. Each year, we first
visited each historic northern goshawk breeding area in April and
May to determine occupancy and locate any active nest. An historic
breeding area was a nest site or cluster of nests where an incubating
goshawk was observed at least once during the previous 3 years. If
occupancy was not confirmed at historic nest sites, we conducted
visual searches within a 1·6 km radius around the centroid of known
nests, excluding pinyon–juniper woodlands, meadows or other
treeless areas. Following USFS South-western Region’s northern
goshawk inventory protocols (Kennedy & Stahlecker 1993; Joy,
Reynolds & Leslie 1994), we also broadcast conspecific recordings to
elicit responses from northern goshawks. Playback tapes provided
by the USFS included both the adult ‘alarm’ call and the female
‘wail’ call. The alarm call was used from June to early July (nestling
period) and the wail call was used from late July to early September
(fledgling period). Because Woodbridge & Detrich (1994) found
95% of alternative nests within 800 m of the last known nest, we
placed 24 calling points uniformly throughout an 800-m radius area
around previous nest sites. If we could not verify nesting activity in
an occupied area early in the season, we conducted a second survey
during the fledgling dependency period (August). We spent up to 7
person-days searching a breeding area before considering it unoccupied.
An area was considered occupied if a pair of goshawks were
inferred to use the area during at least part of the breeding season,
based on presence of a new or refurbished nest, an adult bird at or
near a nest on 
 
≥
 
 2 occasions, or fresh mutes, moulted feathers and
prey remains around a nest structure (Ingraldi 1999). A nest was
considered active if we observed a female goshawk in incubation
posture, at least one fresh egg or egg shell fragments or fledgling or
juvenile northern goshawks (Ingraldi 1999). Active nests were visited
at least once every 10 days to monitor status and productivity.
A nest was deemed successful if at least one nestling survived to
100% of fledgling age (39 days old; Steenhof 1987). Ages were
determined using Boal’s (1994) photographic guide, or by the observed
number of days since hatching. Productivity was measured as
number of nestlings that survived at least 39 days, unless there was
subsequent evidence that the nestlings did not fledge.
We used fledglings per year monitored (occupancy rate times pro-
ductivity per occupied nest) as a measure of reproductive success.
Nest productivity is a problematic measure because it considers only
nest areas where pairs are present and initiate breeding but ignores
intermittent use or early abandonment of lower quality sites
(McClaren 
 
et al.
 
 2002). Krüger & Lindström (2001) found that
breeding pairs of goshawks occupied progressively poorer breeding
sites as number of breeding pairs increased, i.e. only the best sites
were occupied in years with few nesting attempts. Fledglings per
year monitored incorporates both measures. Similarly, Wiens &
Reynolds (2005: 210) found that the number of fledglings produced
per adult goshawk over a 10-year period was ‘a reliable index of
fitness’ (which they defined as recruitment to the breeding population).
We did not use data for the first year each breeding area was discovered
because by definition an area with a newly discovered nest could not
be classified as unoccupied.
From all 46 goshawk breeding areas known and monitored
annually for all or part of 1993–2002, we excluded 18 breeding areas
because > 50% of the breeding area was dominated by either
pinyon–juniper or mixed conifer vegetation types and four breeding
areas at which major disturbance (campground construction,
timber harvest in > 10% of the area during the 10-year period)
occurred during the monitoring period. Because most goshawks in
this region nest in forests dominated by ponderosa pine, we confined
our attention to breeding areas in that forest type. We then selected
the five most productive and five least productive breeding areas,
and selected three areas randomly with intermediate productivity.
For these 13 areas, we calculated fledglings produced per breeding
area (see Table S1 in Supplementary material).
 
MEASURING
 
 
 
FOREST
 
 
 
STRUCTURE
 
After the 10 years of monitoring, when all nest locations had been
determined, we measured forest structure in each of the 13 breeding
areas. We mapped one sample point per 4·05 ha (10 acres) throughout
each breeding area (~300 points per breeding area), assigned each point
a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) location, and used global
positioning system (GPS) units to locate each point on the ground.
Based on radio-telemetry studies, Reynolds 
 
et al
 
. (1992) posited
three key components to a goshawk home range: nest areas (73 ha
divided among three alternate nest areas and three replacement
areas); a post-fledging family area (170 ha near the nest used by the
female and fledglings from incubation through juvenile dispersal);
and a foraging area (2185 ha of additional foraging area for the male
goshawk). Areas close to the nest may have a different influence on
goshawk reproduction than do more distant areas. Thus we
evaluated forest structure in two areas: a circular area centred on
the geographical centroid of the breeding area’s nest locations, and
a larger annulus around this circle. The 243-ha circle (radius 880 m,
~60 sample points) was intended to encompass the nest areas and
post-fledging family area; for brevity we refer to this circle as the
Central Zone of a goshawk breeding area. The annulus was the area
within a circle of radius 1967 m, excluding the Central Zone, and
thus encompassed 972 ha (~240 sample points) of the foraging area
closest to the nest; we refer to this area as the Foraging Band. Totalling
1215 ha, these areas represent half of a 2430-ha home range for a
pair of breeding goshawks (Reynolds 
 
et al
 
. 1992; Kennedy 
 
et al
 
.
1994). Funding limitations precluded sampling additional breeding
areas, or the entire foraging area.
We collected forest stand data at each point, using USFS
intensive (Level I) stand examination procedures (US Forest Service
1993b). At each sample point we placed three concentric plots:
(1) variable-radius plot utilizing a 10 basal area factor (BAF) prism
within which we recorded d.b.h., height and species for each live
tree; (2) 0·405-ha (1-acre) circular plot within which we tallied all
snags > 25·4 cm d.b.h. and logs > 25·4 cm at midpoint; and (3) a
0·00405-ha (0·01-acre) fixed circular plot within which we tallied all
seedlings and saplings < 12·7 cm d.b.h. Our minimum size thresholds
for tallying snags and logs correspond to snag and log definitions in
Reynolds 
 
et al
 
. (1992).
After calculating basal area by species, we used USFS algorithms
to calculate three derived variables at each point: forest type, canopy
closure class and dominant diameter class. We recognized 10 forest
types [non-forest, ponderosa pine, oak, pinyon–juniper (PJ), aspen,
mixed conifer, pine–oak, pine–PJ, oak–PJ and PJ–oak] based on the
basal area of each tree species with respect to thresholds defined
by Eyre (1981) and US Fish and Wildlife Service (1995: 52–58). We
estimated canopy closure class from percentage of a theoretical
maximum Stand Density Index (SDI) for each forest type using the
USFS algorithm (McTague & Patton 1989; US Forest Service
1993b) and maximum SDI values for each forest type proposed by
Long (1985). Canopy closure class boundaries were 40% canopy
closure (corresponding to 30% maximum SDI), 50% canopy closure

(corresponding to 39% of maximum SDI) and 60% (corresponding
to 47% maximum SDI). We recognized six diameter classes, designated
1–6, corresponding to the Vegetative Structural Stages (VSS) used
in USFS Region 3 (Reynolds 
 
et al
 
. 1992; see Table 1, footnote b).

reference forest structures. 
 
S
 
 is scaled from 0% (no similarity) to

similarity between communities or species assemblages, 
 
S
 
 can also
be used to quantify similarity between sampling units and reference

X

 values are the observed values in a
goshawk breeding areas and 
 
X
 
k
 
 values are the value for the same
variable under the reference condition.
We calculated how well each goshawk breeding area resembled
each of four reference forest structures (Table 1), including two
versions of the goshawk guidelines, an empirical estimate of presettle-
ment forest structure and an estimate of preferred foraging habitat.
Reynolds 
 
et al
 
. (1992) developed the goshawk guidelines by identifying
14 goshawk prey species, reviewing the literature on habitat selection
by these species, and interpreting the literature on habitat use by
these 14 species in terms of six tree diameter class (Table 1, footnote b),
canopy closure and numbers of snags and logs. This process yielded
recommendations that nesting habitat should be dominated by
trees > 46 cm d.b.h. with canopy closure > 50%, that the post-
fledging family area should be dominated by the larger diameter
classes with canopy closure > 50%, and the foraging area should be
dominated by larger diameter classes with canopy closure > 40%
(details in Table 1).
Our first model for the goshawk guidelines reflected the distribution
of diameter classes, canopy closures, snags and logs recommended
by Reynolds 
 
et al
 
. (1992). The second version reflected only the
distribution of diameter classes recommended by Reynolds 
 
et al
 
.
(1992). We developed this simpler model for two reasons. First, we
did not measure canopy closure directly in the field, but calculated
it using a Forest Service algorithm (US Forest Service 1993b), which
introduced unknown errors into our estimates of canopy closure
class. Secondly, most goshawk breeding areas had far fewer snags
and logs than recommended by Reynolds 
 
et al
 
. (1992), such that all
goshawk breeding areas were about equally dissimilar from the
goshawk guidelines with regard to these characteristics. This uniform
dissimilarity could mask importance of differences among breeding
areas in tree diameter distributions.
Our reference forest structure for preferred foraging habitat was based
on interpretation of 12 studies of foraging habitat summarized by
Greenwald 
 
et al
 
. (2005). These studies suggest that ideal foraging habitat
is a landscape with an average of 50 large trees ha
 
–1
 
 and 100% of the
landscape with canopy closure > 40% (details in Table 1, footnote c).
Table 1. Reference forest structures that might affect goshawk reproduction or survival in ponderosa pine forests of the South-western United
States. We hypothesized that goshawk reproduction would increase as a goshawk breeding area increasingly resembled the goshawk guidelines
or preferred foraging habitat, but would decrease with increasing resemblance to presettlement conditions. Unless otherwise labelled,
percentages are percentage of landscape area. VSS: Vegetative Structural Stages

density we observed in a goshawk breeding area. Speciﬁed value (50) is 20% larger than the highest mean density we observed in a goshawk 
breeding area. The results of our analyses did not vary when we tried ideal values ranging up to 100 (an implausibly high value for this region).

(b) only small fractions of each breeding area met snag and log targets.

Our reference forest structure for presettlement conditions was
based on reconstructed conditions at two sites in Arizona, one near
Grandview Point on the south rim of the Grand Canyon (Fulé et al.
2002) and one near Mount Trumbull (Waltz et al. 2003). In both
cases, dendroecological methods (Fritts & Swetnam 1989) were
applied to current evidence (old-growth trees, stumps, logs and
other signs of tree removal) to estimate forest conditions prior to
livestock grazing, fire suppression and logging (1870 at Mount
Trumbull, 1887 at Grandview). P. Z. Fulé (Northern Arizona
University) provided the raw data that we used to recreate frequency
distributions of basal area, dominant diameter class and canopy closure
(Fig. 1). These were the only available data on presettlement conditions
in nearby ponderosa pine and pine–oak forests. Soil types in these
two areas were derived from the same parent materials (basalt, calcerous
sandstone and limestone) as those in our study area. Because the
two sites had similar distributions for each variable measured, we
used the mean of the two distributions as the reference condition.

For each set of reference conditions, we built two models that
related goshawk reproduction (number of fledglings fledged per
year monitored) to the percentage similarity of a goshawk breeding
area to that reference forest structure. One model related reproduction
only to conditions in the Central Zone; the second model had an
additional term for the influence of the Foraging Band (Table 2).
We used an information-theoretic approach adjusted for small
sample size [Aikake’s information criterion (AICc); Burnham &
Anderson 2002] to evaluate empirical support for each of the eight
models. Because this approach will always identify the model with
the best support, even when no model is well supported, we report
only models that met minimal thresholds of ΔAICc < 5·0 and
adjusted r2 > 0·10. We compared empirical support among the eight
models.
Results
The 13 goshawk breeding areas varied in their percentage
similarity to reference forest structures (see Table S2 in
Supplementary material). The Central Zones of breeding
areas were on average 32% similar (range 21–56%) to the
forest structure recommended by the goshawk guidelines.
When only the diameter distribution recommended by the
guidelines was considered, average percentage similarity

increased to 50% (range 32–82%). The Foraging Band of a
breeding area was somewhat more similar to the goshawk
guidelines, averaging 43% similarity (range 26–57%) for
the full prescription and 71% (range 53–85%) for the diameter
distribution only. Percentage similarity between breeding
areas and preferred foraging habitat averaged 65% in both
the Central Zone and Foraging Band. Goshawk breeding
areas were about 30% similar to presettlement conditions,
with no Central Zone or Foraging Band exceeding 38%
similarity.
Three of the four models relating goshawk reproduction to
the goshawk guidelines were supported by the data (Table 3),
including two models that included only effect of forest
structure in the Central Zone, and one model that included
effects of both the Central Zone and the Foraging Band.
Contrary to expectation, however, goshawk breeding areas
that resembled most closely the forest structure prescribed
by the goshawk guidelines tended to have lower goshawk
productivity (Table 3, Fig. 2). This negative inﬂuence was
most pronounced for forest conditions in the Central Zone,
for which a 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in percentage
similarity was associated with a half SD decrease in productivity.
The similarity of the Foraging Band to the goshawk guidelines
had a negative association with goshawk productivity in only
one model, but the coefﬁcient was close to zero (Table 3). In
light of these surprising results, we examined models for the
three worst years of goshawk reproduction (1997, 2001 and
2002), as well as the three best years of goshawk reproduction
(1995, 1996 and 1998; details in Table S1 of Supplementary
material). In both cases the same models were supported, and
the sign and size of standardized coefﬁcients were similar to
those observed across all 9 years. No r2 value exceeded 45%
(Table 3).
No model relating goshawk reproduction to ideal foraging
habitat or to presettlement forest structure was supported by
the data. Because our linear models could be insensitive to
non-linear trends we examined scatterplots, which conﬁrmed
the lack of association between ﬂedgling success and these
two forest structures in either the Central Zone or Foraging
Band.
Discussion
A PRIORI HYPOTHESES
None of the expected associations between goshawk repro-
duction and forest structure were conﬁrmed. There was no
evidence of increased goshawk reproduction in breeding
areas that resembled preferred foraging habitat, or of decreased
reproduction in forest structure more similar to presettlement
conditions.
The strongest pattern was that, contrary to our hypothesis,
production of ﬂedglings decreased as the breeding area’s
similarity to the goshawk guidelines increased. Why did
goshawk reproduction not increase with similarity to the
goshawk guidelines? One possibility is that Reynolds et al.
(1992) estimated inaccurately forest conditions that maximize
prey abundance. Their procedure involved three key decisions
or interpretations, each of which was subject to uncertainty
(Arizona Game and Fish Department 1993). First, Reynolds
et al. (1992) gave each prey species equal weighting in their
analysis, despite differences among prey species in biomass,
abundance and contribution to goshawk diet, and despite
the fact that six of the 14 species are unavailable in winter.
Secondly, Reynolds et al. (1992) interpreted primary literature
to estimate whether each species was found in low, moderate or
high abundance in each VSS canopy closure class. These
interpretations were necessarily subjective because the primary
literature did not use VSS as an independent variable and
because the three abundance classes were not deﬁned explicitly.
Thirdly, Reynolds et al. (1992) translated tallies of the number

similarity of a breeding area to a reference forest structure, for 13

of species scoring ‘high’ and ‘medium’ in each VSS class into
optimal percentages of the landscape in each class. Although
Reynolds et al. (1992) discussed and interpreted these tallies
thoughtfully, others (e.g. Arizona Game and Fish Department
1993) interpreted these same data as supporting a prescription
with larger fractions of the landscape dominated by larger
trees and denser canopy closures. Errors at each step in the
process could have synergistic effects that compromised this
conceptual model.
Another possibility is that Reynolds et al. (1992) erred in
their fundamental assumption that goshawks are habitat
generalists and prey specialists that thrive best in a landscape
with abundant prey. Drennan & Beier (2003) and Greenwald
et al. (2005) questioned this assumption and emphasized evidence
that goshawks are prey generalists and habitat specialists.
Finally, the goshawk guidelines use a forest descriptor
(VSS) that has never been evaluated rigorously for its utility
as a descriptor of wildlife habitat (although it was developed
originally for this purpose: Thomas 1979). To the extent that
VSS is an inappropriate descriptor it would contribute to
statistical noise in our analyses, but such noise is unlikely to
cause the negative correlation we observed.
Our results offer no support for the alternative hypothesis
that reproductive success increases in breeding areas with
increasing percentage of ideal foraging habitat. Empirical
studies of foraging locations selected by goshawks in the
western United States (summarized by Greenwald et al. 2005)
were remarkably consistent in documenting that goshawks
use forest structures characterized by relatively dense canopy
and many large trees, but do not use sites with higher prey
abundance. Goshawks in France also seem indifferent to prey
abundance but partial to large trees and high crown volumes
(Penteriani, Faivre & Frochot 2001). Because these forest
conditions did not improve goshawk reproduction, we speculate
that perhaps these forest conditions are associated positively
with demographic parameters that we did not measure, such
as reproductive life span, or adult or post-ﬂedging survival.
Presettlement forest structure (< 250 stems ha−1, < 40%
canopy closure, < 1 large snag and < 1 large log per ha; Fulé
et al. 2002; Waltz et al. 2003) differs markedly both from
preferred habitat and from the recommendations of the goshawk
guidelines. Thus we expected that similarity to this structure
would be correlated negatively with goshawk reproduction.
Our results do not support this notion. However, no goshawk
breeding area was > 39% similar to restored conditions, and
we caution against extrapolating our results to the effects of
large-area restoration treatments.
The three forest structures we examined had only moderate
inﬂuence on goshawk productivity. Two other studies, using
different forest traits, found little inﬂuence of forest structure
on reproductive success of northern goshawks in the western
United States. Joy (2002) found that proportions of six vegeta-
tion types did not differ between 56 higher-productivity and
44 lower-productivity goshawk territories in a 9-year study in
northern Arizona. Patla (1997) observed no effect of percentage
mature forest on goshawk occupancy or goshawk productivity
per occupied nest, and attributed this result to the fact that all
territories had high (> 60%) percentage mature forest with
little inter-territory variation. The most regularly occupied
territories in her study were characterized by relatively greater
proportions of mature forest cover. Patla (1997) also observed
a small positive effect of sage-scrub openings on occupancy
and reproduction (r2 = 0·22) and speculated that prey
production was relatively high in those openings.
The low correlations we observed may be related to the fact
that our circular areas did not necessarily correspond to areas
of most intense goshawk use. None the less, we believe the
1215-ha circular areas we sampled included most areas used
by breeding goshawks parents and ﬂedglings during the
breeding season. On the nearby Coconino National forest,
mean home range size (95% harmonic mean) during the
breeding season was 840 ha for 23 females and 1341 ha for 12
males (Hall 2001). Similarly, our 880-m radius Central Zone
probably includes areas most important to juveniles and
adult females during the ﬂedgling dependency period.
Kennedy et al. (1994) reported that 96% of the locations of
ﬂedglings were within 800 m of the nest during the ﬁrst
4 weeks of the juvenile dependency period, decreasing to 76%
in the last 4 weeks. However, these home range areas are not
circular, and goshawks use areas within their home range
non-uniformly (Kennedy et al. 1994; Beier & Drennan 1997).
WHAT MAKES SOME GOSHAWK BREEDING AREAS 
MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN OTHERS?
Like Krüger & Lindström (2001), we observed that some
goshawk breeding areas consistently produced more ﬂedglings
than others. The contrary ﬁndings of McClaren et al. (2002)
may reﬂect their use of ﬂedglings per active nest as the
response variable, ignoring differences in occupancy rates
among breeding areas. However, if forest structure does not
drive productivity, what does? Plausible hypotheses include
prey abundance, disturbance, weather patterns and parenting
ability of goshawk breeders.
Prey abundance was correlated with year-to-year variation
in reproduction for goshawk populations studied for 4–
10 years in the western United States (Doyle & Smith 1994;
Keane 1999; Salafsky, Reynolds & Noon 2005) and Sweden
(Tornberg, Korpimäki & Byholm 2006), but was uncorrelated
with goshawk population growth in a 24-year time–series in
Germany (Krüger & Lindström 2001). Based on the three US
studies, we believe that prey abundance is a major driver of
year-to-year variation in reproduction for goshawk popula-
tions in the western United States. A reasonable hypothesis is
that prey abundance also drives reproductive variation among
goshawk breeding areas. To our knowledge, no study has
tested this hypothesis.
Disturbance levels, such as number of roads, trafﬁc volume
on roads or trails, amount of residential development, timber
harvest and research activity (e.g. nest checks, nest surveys)
could also affect goshawk reproduction. These disturbances
were relatively constant across our 13 breeding areas, but
we believe that an unauthorized camping area did cause aban-
donment of one breeding area that had been consistently

productive before intensive camping began near the nest
stand.
Weather patterns, such as spring and summer precipitation,
are correlated with between-year variation in goshawk
reproduction (Kostrzewa & Kostrzewa 1990; Patla 1997;
Penteriani 1997; Ingraldi 1999; Bloxton 2002; Fairhurst &
Bechard 2005). However, for such effects to account for
variation among goshawk breeding areas, the breeding areas
would have to experience different weather patterns. We do
not believe this was the case on our study area.
Finally, our most productive breeding areas may have
reﬂected qualities of the breeding pairs rather than forest
structure within the breeding area. However, given a mean
reproductive life span of 2 years (Wiens & Reynolds 2005),
several generations of high-quality parents would have to
use a given breeding area to create high productivity over
9 years of observations. Until a researcher devises a method
to measure parenting ability independently from nest success,
it would be difﬁcult to design a study to test this hypothesis
rigorously.
MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS
The goshawk guidelines were conceived as an approach to
management that would address the needs of multiple species
(goshawks and 14 prey species) and meet other forest objectives
(Reynolds et al. 1992). Compared to the years when production
of ﬁbre and ungulates drove forest management, the guidelines
marked a big step towards ecosystem management and
conservation of all native species. However, the assumptions
behind the guidelines remain a set of largely untested hypotheses.
Despite small sample size and the use of an observational
rather than experimental approach, we found a moderate
negative correlation between goshawk productivity and the
forest structure prescribed by the guidelines. This calls into
question the purported beneﬁt to goshawks. Studies have not
yet addressed response of the 14 prey species.
These results raise questions about the decision (US Forest
Service 1996) to implement the goshawk guidelines on most
Forest Service lands in Arizona and New Mexico. In (1993, the
Arizona Game and Fish Department (1993: 62) recommended
that the Forest Service ‘identify areas... which reﬂect the desired
future conditions identiﬁed in the [goshawk guidelines, and] ...
monitor these areas to see if goshawks and the 14 targeted
prey have responded as expected’. Our study suggests that
goshawks did not respond as expected, and the monitoring
and adaptive management approach recommended in 1993 is
equally important today.
More broadly, many prescriptions for managing forests
and other wildlands are based on ecological hypotheses.
Managers should evaluate empirical support for the ecological
hypotheses that are being applied to large landscapes. Careful
allocation of areas to prescription and control sites, adequate
replication and long-term monitoring are essential to evaluate
empirical support in the most rigorous fashion. Observational
studies such as ours can be a fast and relatively inexpensive
alternative.
