Abstract—The management of national park and wilderness areas
dominated by forest ecosystems adapted to frequent, low-intensity
fires, continues to be a tremendous challenge. Throughout the
inland West and particularly in the Southwest, ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa) and mixed conifer forests have become dense and
structurally homogeneous after periods of intense livestock grazing,
followed by more than 100 years of fire suppression. Prior to the late
1800s, pine-dominated forests at Grand Canyon National Park
were structurally diverse, averaging 45 to 90 trees per acre, with
frequent, low-intensity fires burning across the landscape every 7 to
11 years. Today, much of the historic landscape heterogeneity has
been replaced by dense, contiguous stands averaging 600 to 900
trees per acre. The beneficial reintroduction of fire to these areas is
difficult and often results in fire effects that are uncharacteristic of
those produced by historic fire regimes. In response, park managers
have called for the exploration of restoration approaches using
combinations of prescribed fire and understory thinning. The goal
of this approach is to achieve more natural and sustainable forest
structures while conserving the most fragile elements of the exist-
ing ecosystem such as old-growth trees and native herbaceous
communities. This paper describes the approach, rationale and
preliminary results of a project designed to examine the utility and
ecological effects of three, small-scale restoration experiments on a
suite of forest structure attributes.
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and mixed conifer
forests throughout western North America have under-
gone striking changes since the cessation of a high-fre-
quency, low-intensity fire regime in the late 1800s (Swetnam
and Baisan 1996; Barrett and others 1997; Covington and
others 1997a). At Grand Canyon National Park increas-
ingly dense forest structures have enveloped meadows,

homogenized landscapes, and now provide a conduit for the
development of large-scale, high intensity fires (GRCA
1992; Moore 1994; Nichols and others 1994). Recent at-
tempts to reintroduce fire into these dense forests have
been costly to prepare, difficult to control and often produce
damaging fire effects, particularly in mixed conifer forests
on the North Rim of the Park (Nichols and others 1994).
The most notable effect of these high intensity fires is a
marked loss of old-growth trees due to excessive crown
scorch and pockets of stand replacing fire. These effects are
of particular concern since Grand Canyon National Park
contains some of the largest remaining tracts of unhar-
vested old-growth forest in the Southwest.
Interagency fire management reviews have called for the
exploration of methods to mechanically thin understory
trees and remove forest floor fuels before widespread appli-
cation of prescribed fire (Davis 1981; Nichols and others
1994; Botti and others 1997). In consultation with Park
managers, we designed a project to explore alternative
approaches to deal with this management problem (Covington
and others 1997b). This approach is based on evidence that,
for ecosystem restoration to be successful, tree understories
must be thinned prior to the application of fire, because
underburning is insufficient to thin the dense stands that
have developed since fire regime disruption (Sackett and
others 1996). Restored tree structures that reflect historic
variability as expressed by densities, spatial patterns and
species composition should result in more sustainable grow-
ing conditions for native plant communities and the habitats
they provide (Kaufmann and others 1994).
Fire managers at Grand Canyon are highly proficient and
have been proactive in their attempts to return the natural
role of fire to the Park’s forests. In recent years with the
adoption of more flexible fire-use policies, significant acre-
ages (primarily in the ponderosa pine type) are being burned.
These management fires do exhibit some benefits such as a
measurable decrease in forest floor organic matter and the
consumption of ladder fuels. However, due to heavy fuel
concentrations, these fires also have the potential to create
locally intense fire effects that are likely to be detrimental to
native plants and animals (sensu Neary and others 1999).
These adverse effects which include old growth tree mortal-
ity, pockets of crown fire, and intense soil heating are
particularly apparent in the mixed conifer forests on the
North Rim and prevail even though prescribed burns are
applied conservatively and with great skill (Nichols and

250
USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-15-VOL-5. 2000
others 1994). Attempts to reintroduce fire to the Park’s
ponderosa pine forests produce fewer adverse effects, but in
general, management ignitions in this forest type typically
do not adequately thin sapling and pole sized trees, as they
have already developed fire-resistant bark (Sackett and
others 1996). When fires of sufficient intensity to thin small
diameter ponderosa pine trees are prescribed, the result is
increased old growth tree mortality and soil heating (Nichols
and others 1994; Sackett and others 1996; and Neary and
others 1999). In an attempt to surmount these difficult
issues, we proposed to test alternative methods that utilize
combinations of process restoration (fire) and structure
restoration (tree thinning), to restore forest structures that
will be more sustainable upon the reintroduction of fre-
quent fires.
The development of any relevant, ecologically sound res-
toration approach relies upon a solid understanding of the
historic range of variability of the ecosystem (Morgan and
others 1994; Moore and others 1999). For this project, target
conditions were quantified for experimental restoration
approaches based upon reconstructions of forest structures
and disturbance regimes that existed at the time of fire
regime disruption. Reconstructions of forest conditions in
the Southwest are quite feasible given a continuous period
of fire suppression since the late 1800s, coupled with ex-
tremely slow rates of decomposition. This combination of
factors has maintained most evidence of the tree structure
that existed at the time of fire regime disruption allowing for
an accurate reconstruction of tree density, spatial pattern,
and species composition (Fulé and others 1997; Huffman
and others 1999). It is important to realize that while initial
restoration treatments are directed toward a particular
point in time, we do not view such a treated condition as a
static structure to be maintained in perpetuity. Instead, we
view this restored condition as merely a sustainable starting
point for the reintroduction of fire that is consistent with
historic fire regimes and the forest structures they produced.
It will be the effects of future fires burning in the restored
fuel matrix that will shape and maintain more natural forest
structures and processes.
The development of specific restoration prescriptions has
been a lengthy process that was shaped by public comments
and feedback from park managers, scientists and environ-
mental groups. In particular, this relates to restoration
experiments in mixed conifer forests on the North Rim,
which are within areas proposed for wilderness designation.
While the overall goals of restoration based management
are compatible with wilderness management, there are
several short-term effects associated with restoration activi-
ties that create temporary conflicts with wilderness values.
These may include tree thinning and associated stumps,
forest floor fuel manipulation, and the operation of mecha-
nized equipment. The artifacts of restoration activities, such
as stumps and slash, are usually erased following several
prescribed burning cycles (5–15 years). When compared to
the hundreds of years it takes to re-establish old growth tree
structures that are lost to high intensity fires, a one to two
decade visual effect may prove to be an acceptable alterna-
tive. Through consultation with Park managers, we con-
tinue to develop and refine approaches that seek to make
short-term restoration practices as compatible as possible
with wilderness values.
Objectives _____________________
The specific objectives of this project are to quantify
historic forest structures and fire regimes, and measure
current forest structures. Secondly, we will examine the
operational utility and effects on forest structure of several
restoration treatments using combinations of prescribed fire
and understory tree thinning. Since experiments are ongo-
ing, this paper is limited to a discussion of current and
reconstructed presettlement conditions, as well as the devel-
opment of experimental treatments.
Study Area _____________________
Grand Canyon National Park is located in north central
Arizona, approximately 70 miles north of Flagstaff. Eleva-
tions range from 1,650 to 9,165 feet, with vegetation commu-
nities that range from desert scrub to subalpine forests. The
Park consists of two management units, South Rim and
North Rim, bisected by the vast inner canyon carved by the
Colorado River. Our project focuses on the forest ecosystems
above the rims and includes ponderosa pine - Gambel oak
(Quercus Gambelii) and mixed conifer forests. Mixed conifer
forests at the Grand Canyon contain combinations of ponde-
rosa pine, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), white fir
(Abies concolor) and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides).
Though none of the Park is designated wilderness, much of
the North Rim is proposed wilderness, which requires man-
agement actions that will maintain wilderness character.
Methods _______________________
In order to measure the treatment effects of restoration
experiments, we established small-scale (80-acre) experi-
mental blocks on both rims of the Park. One experimental
block was located in the North Rim mixed conifer forest,
and two were located within South Rim ponderosa pine—
Gambel oak forests. One of the South Rim experimental
blocks is located adjacent to the Park boundary on the
Tusayan District of the Kaibab National Forest. Each
experimental block was divided into four, twenty-acre
units that were randomly assigned one of four experimen-
tal treatments. Within each unit, we installed twenty, 0.1-
acre permanent plots, where we measured tree ages, tree
overstory (species, condition, diameter, height, and crown
characteristics), seedling structure, evidence of insects and
pathogens, forest floor fuel loadings, and herbaceous/shrub
community structure. Reconstructions of presettlement
forest structure are based on a dendroecological model
described in (Covington and Moore 1994; and Fulé and
others 1997).
To obtain fire history information, we collected partial
cross sections from fire-scarred trees, snags, stumps and
logs located throughout the study areas. Samples were
surfaced, cross-dated and years were assigned to specific
fire events as indicated by fire scarred tree-rings (Stokes
and Smiley 1968). Fire event determinations were verified
by a second dendroecologist and fire events were then
compiled to illustrate the dynamics of the historic fire
regime at each study site (Fulé and Heinlein, this volume).

Results and Discussion __________
Presettlement and Contemporary Forest
Structures and Fire Regimes
Prior to fire regime disruption, presettlement ponderosa
pine/Gambel oak forests on the South Rim experimental
blocks (EB1 and EB2) averaged 45.2 and 48.4 trees per acre
with a total basal area of 40.5 to 60.8 ft2/acre (table 1). There
have been no widespread fires on these sites since 1887.
However, prior to 1887, fires occurred on average, every 7 to
9 years (Covington and others 1998). Current forest struc-
tures have changed substantially, both in terms of tree
density and basal area. The same areas now average 580.3
to 897.4 trees per acre with a total basal area of 98.5 to 102.5
ft2/acre (table 1). Current tree densities are significantly
different between experimental blocks and this trend is
likely attributable to contrasting land-use histories. For
example, EB1, which is located on the Kaibab National
Forest, was logged in the early 1900s, continuously grazed
by domestic livestock and is a fuelwood harvesting area. In
contrast, no logging, fuelwood harvesting or livestock graz-
ing has occurred on EB2.
Forest structures have also changed substantially within
the North Rim mixed conifer experimental block (EB3).
Prior to fire regime disruption, this site averaged 93.1 trees
per acre with a total basal area of 101.1 ft2/acre (table 1).
There have been no widespread fires on this site since 1879.
Prior to 1879, fires occurred every 7 to 11 years (Covington
and others 1998). Today, the same area contains 571.1 trees
per acre with a total basal area of 188.7 ft2/acre (table 1). In
addition to these large density increases, species composi-
tion has shifted from a ponderosa pine dominated mixed
conifer forest to a white fir dominated forest (table 1).
Experimental Treatments
In light of the ecological trends occurring in Grand Canyon
forests, we propose to test the effects of three treatments and
a control on a suite of ecological variables, including fire
behavior and fire effects on tree structure, herbaceous plant
community structure and forest floor fuels. Within the Park,
thinning activities will exclusively target trees less than 5
inches dbh, with all cut material remaining on-site. Thinned
material on the Kaibab National Forest experimental block
(EB1) will be sold to a fuelwood contractor. Hand tools are
proposed for thinning the North Rim site (EB3), while chain
saws are proposed for thinning the South Rim sites (EB1 and
EB2). In addition, fences have been constructed around EB1
to exclude future livestock grazing. Detailed descriptions of
experimental treatments are as follows:
Control—No thinning or prescribed fire treatments will
take place. Forest structure will be monitored over time to
track the continued effects of fire exclusion. Deliberate
protection from wildfire or prescribed burning will continue
on control sites in perpetuity.
Prescribed Fire—This treatment will test the effects of
using prescribed fire without any manipulation of under-
story trees or forest floor fuels. This approach represents
current management practices being applied at Grand Can-
yon National Park (GRCA Fire Management Plan 1992).
Table 1—Comparison of presettlement and current overstory tree density and basal area. Presettlement forest structures are based on
reconstructed conditions at the time of fire regime disruption. Historic fire regimes were disrupted in 1887 on experimental block 1 and
2. The last widespread fire on experimental block 3 occurred in 1879. Data is derived from 80, 0.1-acre plots per experimental block.

Minimal Thinning—This treatment will involve thin-
ning the minimum number of trees necessary to reintroduce
prescribed fires without significant mortality to old-growth
trees. The focus of thinning activities is to break up ladder
fuels and remove small trees in close proximity to presettle-
ment-era trees. The extent of thinning around targeted old-
growth trees will vary, and will be based on existing research
results focused on the effects of accumulated fuels and
associated fire effects (Ryan and Reinhardt 1988; Ryan and
others 1998). Additionally, thick accumulations of duff and
litter will be raked from around the base of all presettlement
trees to minimize adverse effects from smoldering combus-
tion (Ryan and Frandsen 1991; Swezy and Agee 1991;
Sackett and others 1996). Prescribed fire will then be ap-
plied to consume existing fuels and to promote additional
thinning of fire intolerant postsettlement trees (Thomas and
Agee 1986; Mutch and Parsons 1997). Additional prescribed
fires are planned in perpetuity, based on reconstructed fire
regimes (Covington and others 1998).
Full Restoration Treatment—This treatment will use
a diameter-limit understory tree thinning to reconfigure
stand structures and spatial patterns to more closely re-
semble those that existed at the time of fire regime disrup-
tion (Covington and others 1997). This alternative focuses
on the conservation of presettlement-era trees and the
maintenance of specific spatial structures. This will be
accomplished through the thinning of small diameter trees
(up to 5 inches at dbh), raking of accumulated forest floor
fuels around the base of presettlement trees and the rein-
troduction of repeated frequent, low-intensity fires. Fires
will be prescribed following reconstructed intervals and
seasonalities.
Discussion _____________________
With the exception of several remote areas in the north-
west corner of the Park (Fulé and others, this volume),
forests throughout the Grand Canyon have become much
denser, have heavier fuel loads than in the past and are at
tremendous risk for stand-replacing fires. While there is
general agreement among ecologists and ecologically-
trained managers that restoration strategies must be de-
veloped and implemented, the selection of an appropriate
management approach remains the subject of much debate
(Parsons and others 1984; Bonnicksen and Stone 1985;
Stephenson 1999). A process restoration approach that
involves the reintroduction of fire and a structure restora-
tion approach that requires tree thinning prior to the
application of fire, are the two methods we will explore. The
process restoration method, in the form of prescribed natu-
ral and manager ignited fires, has been implemented in
many national parks and wilderness areas (Parsons and
Landres 1998). Ecologically and economically, this ap-
proach has been most beneficial in areas that contain large
contiguous tracts of forest that have evolved with infre-
quent, high-intensity stand replacement fire regimes (pri-
marily mesic mixed conifer and subalpine forests). In other
areas, such as sequoia groves (Sequoiadendron giganteum)
in the Sierra Nevada, modern fire suppression has not
impacted historic stand structures to the point where the
reintroduction of fire is detrimental (Stephenson 1999).
Unfortunately, these same approaches have proven to be of
limited utility in the lower-elevation ponderosa pine domi-
nated ecosystems found throughout the interior West
(Sackett and others 1996). Large increases in stand densi-
ties and successional advances by shade-tolerant tree spe-
cies coupled with steady accumulations of forest floor fuels
make the reintroduction of prescribed fire in these areas a
very complex, costly and potentially damaging endeavor.
Compared to other ongoing restoration projects in the
Southwest (Covington and others 1997a), the experiments
being applied within the Park experimental blocks (EB1 and
EB2) are more conservative in their approach. The major
differences are the extent of structural manipulation prior to
the reintroduction of fire and the amount of time it will take
to restore presettlement structures. This project proposes to
mechanically thin trees smaller than 5 inches dbh and will
rely more on the thinning effects of fire to achieve forest
structures that resemble target conditions. In both the
ponderosa pine and mixed conifer areas, the vast majority of
trees occur within the 1-5 inch diameter class (fig. 1), but for
several reasons, the effects of this thinning will likely differ.
In the South Rim ponderosa pine/Gambel oak forests there
will be a substantial number of residual postsettlement
ponderosa pines, particularly in the 5-9 inch diameter class,
that may be difficult to thin with prescribed fires (Sackett
and others 1996). In the North Rim mixed conifer forest,
there will also be a sizeable number of residual trees in the
5-9 inch diameter class (fig. 1). However, the majority of
these trees are fire-intolerant white fir, Douglas-fir, and
Engelmann spruce, all of which are easily killed by low-
intensity fires (Thomas and Agee 1986; Ryan and Reinhardt
1988; and Mutch and Parsons 1997). In summary, we expect
a more rapid return to presettlement conditions in the North
Rim mixed conifer forest and a longer process in the South
Rim ponderosa pine/Gambel oak areas.
The application of structure restoration, in combination
with prescribed fire, should be viewed as a flexible manage-
ment tool that can be used in many situations to accomplish
a variety of goals. For example, fire managers could initially
use operational-scale restoration thinning to accomplish
components of their current workload, including the prepa-
ration of control-lines for large prescribed burns, securing
boundaries with adjoining land owners, reduction of fuels in
old-growth areas and the protection of administrative sites.
The completion of this preliminary work would provide a
monitored, incremental step toward the expansion of struc-
ture restoration that would be of immediate utility. Once
implemented and refined, managers could further apply the
methodology with greater confidence and efficiency.
Regardless of the rationale presented in this paper,
restoration through management intervention is contro-
versial and remains a relatively untested concept in na-
tional parks. There are critics who argue that a hands-off
management approach is entirely appropriate and most
closely aligned with Park Service mandates. Even among
those who agree that intervention is needed, there are
many additional issues surrounding the choice of an appro-
priate method that must be resolved. This research project
is intended to more fully inform debate on these issues by
providing information on the effects of both process and
structure/process restoration on vegetation structure, fuel
loadings, operational utility and social reaction.
