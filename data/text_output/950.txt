ERI helps advance technologies for forest
management 
Advanced forest management technologies such as LiDAR, tablet-based
prescriptions and marking, and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are widely
used in private sector forestry to help lower management costs and increase
efﬁciency. To increase the pace and scale of restoration efforts on public land,
the Forest Service launched a Forest Products Modernization (FPM) initiative,
which addresses technology gaps and promotes tools and learning strategies
that will help achieve restoration and forest management goals. 
Over the past two years, the ERI has worked with the Forest Service on its
FPM initiative. At the local level, ERI facilitates efforts by the 4FRI Forest
Service implementation team, The Nature Conservancy, and Campbell Global
to test innovative management approaches that include LiDAR, tablet
technology, use of virtual boundaries, and others that will increase efﬁciency

and lower cost to both the Forest Service and contractors. In addition, the ERI
participated as a neutral third party in the Forest Service’s national FPM
strategy development. The ERI provided partner insights that may have been
missed during internal discussions. This work illustrates how varied and
important our work is to help accelerate the science and implementation of
restoration.

Findings from this study, which are summarized in the fact sheet, suggest

prescribed burning are likely to lead to more resilient plant communities that are
more tolerant of drought and warm temperatures.

Forest Operations and Biomass Utilization
By Jeff Halbrook, Research Associate
Camp Navajo Forest Products Business Cluster: The Forest Operations and
Biomass Utilization program at ERI is working with industry and local
stakeholders to identify and locate forest products industries sited at Camp
Navajo, located west of Flagstaff, Arizona. The ERI is working with Camp
Navajo and the Army Corp of Engineers to obtain a one-year easement to test
the logistics of using rail systems to chip and ship wood ﬁber from Arizona to
distant markets. If the pilot project logistics are favorable, chipping and shipping
may be one of the ﬁrst wood products industries at Camp Navajo. By increasing
wood product access through rail transportation to Asian markets, communities
across the western US may ﬁnd uses for an overabundance of woody biomass,
a byproduct of forest restoration.  
 
Helicopter ﬂying whole trees to landing on Flagstaff Watershed Protection Project.

Whole-tree helicopter yarding productivity analysis: The San Francisco Peaks,
located north of Flagstaff, Arizona, are a critical watershed for the city. The
forests in this area are at risk of high-severity wildﬁre and subsequent
catastrophic ﬂooding due to a terrain of steep slopes and overcrowded forest
conditions. To thin a strategic, steep area, crews are using a helicopter to
extract whole trees, including limbs and braches. Researchers at ERI are
studying the productivity and logistics associated with these operations. ERI
staff are conducting a detailed work analysis of the felling, hooking, helicopter
extraction, and landing operations. Information from this research project will
help land managers and private contractors predict operational costs
associated with helicopter logging as well as which variables could improve
productivity of fuels reduction projects.
Research and Development 
2019 Summer Field Season Outlook
By David W. Huffman, Research and Development Director
 
In summer 2019, ERI ﬁeld crews will collect data from several sites that make
up our Long-term Ecological Assessment and Restoration Network (LEARN).
Data from this work will allow the ERI to address broad questions related to
effectiveness of restoration treatments, particularly the effects of thinning and
prescribed ﬁre on survival and growth of old trees and the importance of
prescribe ﬁre for extending treatment longevity. Crews will also visit sites across
Arizona and collect data that, when paired with remote sensing data, will be
used for landscape-scale analyses. In one of these projects, ERI ecologists will
investigate long-term changes in ponderosa pine cover within the lower
ecotone where forest ecosystems are especially vulnerable to climate and
wildﬁre impacts. Another landscape-scale project will quantify spatial patterns
and other forest attributes within wildﬁres that have been managed to achieve
resource beneﬁts. These projects will provide valuable information to assist
forest managers in planning and prioritizing ecological restoration treatments at
multiple scales.
ERI Science Delivery and Outreach News 
By Caleb Stotts, Program Coordinator, and Bryce Esch, Sr. Program
Coordinator

We are committed to assessing the latest science needs and communicating
restoration science to our land management partners to better meet forest
management goals. A few highlights across this broad program of work include:
West-wide: The ERI is working to understand how projects within the
Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) are measuring
landscape-level restoration success. As the ﬁrst ten-year CFLRP funding cycle
comes to a close, ERI’s goal is to help stakeholders and the Forest Service
better understand the challenges of monitoring landscape-scale desired
conditions and to identify what indicators and datasets could be used for
landscape-level assessment.  
Region-wide: In response to land manager inquiries, the ERI partnered with
the Tonto and Prescott national forests to study transitional pine and evergreen
oak ecosystems. ERI staff are researching the historical role of ﬁre, how forest
conditions have changed through time, and fuel reduction treatment effects on
forest structure. During this research, we work with managers to host annual
“learning exchange” workshops, which bring scientists and forest managers
together to share information about ecological research and fuel management
strategies.
Forest projects:In fall 2018, ﬁre managers on the Coconino National Forest
implemented a prescribed ﬁre in the Fort Valley Experimental Forest northeast
of Flagstaff. Since 1994, ﬁre managers have maintained a four-year burning
interval, making this the seventh prescribed ﬁre on the project. While this
project area is just a few acres in size, the methods used to restore and
maintain forest structure in this experiment helped inform the development of
restoration projects throughout the Southwest.

is one of the three university-based institutes that makes up the Southwest
Ecological Restoration Institutes (PL108-317), which also includes the ERI and
the New Mexico Forest and Watershed Restoration Institute (NMFWRI). The
institutes have a shared mission of applied research that helps shape healthy
forests, prevent wildﬁres, and create jobs. This year, the ERI is working closely
with CFRI and NMFWRI to organize a workshop for stakeholders and agency
personnel that will assess the progress made in the 10 years since the original
Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration legislation.
