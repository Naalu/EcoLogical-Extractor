The Fort Valley Experiment Station (now Fort Valley Experimental Forest) has contributed many long-
term studies to forest research. This paper focuses on a “Methods of Cutting” study initiated in 1913 on
the Coulter Ranch Unit of Fort Valley and how that long-term study yielded important ecological and
management lessons. We quantiﬁed the historical and contemporary forest patterns at this ponderosa
pine–Gambel oak site, which was harvested using three different harvesting systems in 1913 (seed tree,
group selection, and light selection) and was partially excluded from livestock browsing in 1919. Using
nine historically stem-mapped permanent plots for the following three stand structural scenarios: 1913
pre-harvest (modeled), post-harvest (actual), and 2003–2006 (actual) conditions, we examined the short-
and long-term consequences of harvest and livestock grazing land-use and stand dynamics. We assessed
changes in spatial pattern under each harvesting system and in each structural scenario, and lastly, we
examined spatial and temporal tree recruitment patterns as observed in the contemporary (2003–2006)
conditions. The seed tree harvests effectively converted the spatial patterns from aggregated to random
and left few trees, while the group selection and light selection had varying effects, but consistently
exaggerated the spatial patchiness of the stand. By 2003–2006, all plots were aggregated at all scales
and were one large patch of predominately small trees. Sites that were harvested, but excluded from
livestock browsing had 40% more trees in 2003–2006. Contemporary recruitment patterns were signiﬁ-
cantly aggregated under all harvesting systems, but were most strongly aggregated if the site received a
group selection or light selection cut. For group and light selection, pine seedlings initially established in
stump patches created by harvesting and then proceeded to ﬁll-in the remaining area, with recruitment
rarely found under the residual pine or oak trees. Long-term data sets, such as these established by the
Fort Valley Experimental Forest in 1913, are essential for quantifying the impact of historical land-use
practices on contemporary forest composition and structure. Ignoring land-use legacies may lead to the
misinterpretation of stand dynamics and development, and therefore should be explicitly quantiﬁed and
incorporated into future management and restoration activities.

1. Introduction
The Fort Valley Experiment Station (now Fort Valley Experi-
mental Forest; FVEF) has contributed many long-term studies and
ecological lessons to forest research as the USFS ﬁrst experimen-
tal station in the nation (Olberding, 2002). In 1908, the station
was established in the ponderosa pine forests of northern Ari-
zona with its initial focus on silvicultural research. G.A. Pearson,
ﬁrst director of Fort Valley, and his team of scientists conducted
pioneering research on natural and artiﬁcial regeneration, stand

improvement, individual tree and stand dynamics, and they initi-
ated one of the ﬁrst studies to determine the factors that controlled
and limited the distribution of tree species. Many of these early
studies are described in detail in “Fort Valley Experimental Forest
– A Century of Research 1908–2008” (Olberding and Moore, 2008;
http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs p053.html).
For this paper, we focused on one case study from Fort Valley
that exempliﬁes how long-term studies yield important ecological
and management lessons. The case study experiment was initiated
in 1913 on the Coulter Ranch section of FVEF. The original purpose
of the study was to determine the effects of harvesting methods
on tree regeneration and growth in a ponderosa pine–Gambel oak
(Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum Dougl. ex Laws.–Quercus gambelii
Nutt.) forest. The experiment was part of the nation-wide ‘Methods
of Cutting’ study that examined the feasibility of seed tree, group
selection, and light selection regeneration harvests. We deter-
mined the effects of these three silvicultural harvest treatments

and livestock browsing on historical (1913) and contemporary
(2003–2006) stand density, tree size, and spatial patterns.
The initial settlement of the Southwest by Euro-Americans (circa
1880s) markedly changed forest structure through intensive log-
ging, livestock grazing and ﬁre suppression, as well as indirectly
through ﬁre exclusion (Fulé et al., 1997; Allen et al., 2002; Moore et
al., 2004; Cocke et al., 2005). These legacies of past land-use prac-
tices, or land-use legacies (a.k.a. site history or disturbance history),
may inﬂuence forest structure and function for decades to centuries
(Foster et al., 2003). Scientists and managers recognize the impor-
tance of land-use legacies, but only when we quantify the impact
of these past activities can we use that information to understand
contemporary or future conditions.
Land-use legacies commonly persist for many decades within
ecosystems, including ponderosa pine forests, and have been
shown to inﬂuence contemporary conditions (e.g., Christensen,
1989; Fulé et al., 1997; Foster et al., 2003; Youngblood et al.,
2004; Moore et al., 2004). An understanding of disturbance his-
tory and vegetation change provides a context for ecological studies
(Christensen, 1989; Pickett et al., 1997), a basis for natural resource
management and planning (Moore et al., 1999; Swetnam et al.,
1999; Egan and Howell, 2001), and is essential in restoration mod-
eling (e.g., Covington et al., 2001). Contemporary management
practices in southwestern ponderosa pine ecosystems must con-
sider the historical context under which current forest structure
developed and the subsequent inﬂuences of early silviculture and
land management practices. Few studies have been able to iso-
late effects of harvest history on ponderosa pine stand dynamics
and only a few have examined their inﬂuence on spatial pattern
(Cooper, 1961; White, 1985; Biondi et al., 1994; Sánchez Meador et
al., 2009, 2010).
We investigated how historical land management practices, or
land-use legacies, have inﬂuenced the forest structure over a 93-
year period on a long-term silviculture research site in northern
Arizona. The study site is representative of ponderosa pine–Gambel
oak forests found throughout northern Arizona, but is unusual in
that different harvesting systems were applied when the study
began in 1913. This dataset provides a unique opportunity to
examine the interactions of historical (1913) harvesting methods,
livestock use, and long-term (1913–2006) dynamics on forest struc-
ture and spatial pattern.
Our study addressed ﬁve questions: (1) how might forest struc-
ture have looked in the absence of seed tree, group selection and
light selection harvesting in 1913 on a ponderosa pine–Gambel oak
site in northern Arizona? (2) How did each harvesting system affect
stand characteristics and spatial patterns over the short-term (as
observed in 1913 following harvest)? (3) How did stand character-
istics and spatial patterns change over the long-term (as observed
in 2003–2006)? (4) How did the stand structural patterns result-
ing from harvesting and livestock use (speciﬁcally sheep browsing)
inﬂuence the recruitment of subsequent ponderosa pine cohorts
across the site and within each of the three harvesting systems?
(5) Where did recruitment occur with respect to unharvested pine
and oak trees, pine stumps, and natural grass openings?

is 7.9 ◦C and average annual precipitation at the Fort Valley Exper-
iment Forest (FVEF) weather station is 502.9 mm. Precipitation
follows a monsoonal pattern with half falling as rain in July and
August, and half as snow in the winter (Sellers and Hill, 1974). Ele-
vations range from 2240 to 2300 m and the study area has a gently
rolling topography. The lowest elevations bisect the center of the
site, providing both northerly and southerly aspects. Soils, derived
from Tertiary basalt ﬂows and cinders, are classiﬁed as a complex
of ﬁne, smectitic Typic Argiborolls, Lithic Eutroboralfs, and Mol-
lic Eutroboralfs, primarily with clay loam and stony clay textures.
The site is within vegetation units (Terrestrial Ecosystem Units 582,
585, and 586) that collectively comprise over 109,000 ha (14%) of
the Coconino National Forest (Miller et al., 1995). Ponderosa pine
and Gambel oak are the dominant trees, with scattered New Mexi-
can locust (Robinia neomexicana Gray) thickets and single alligator
juniper (Juniperus deppeana Steud.) stems occurring throughout the
study area.
2.2. Project history of Coulter Ranch
This research was initiated in 1913 on the Coulter Ranch section
of FVEF (a.k.a. S5 Unit or COCS5). The site had not been harvested
prior to the experiment initiation. The main objectives of the orig-
inal study were to determine the amount of tree canopy cover
needed to adequately shelter young trees from the sun and desicca-
tion, as well as quantify effects of harvesting methods on advanced
regeneration, newseedlingestablishment, and residual tree growth
(Krauch, 1926, 1933, 1934, 1937; Lexen, 1939; Pearson, 1923, 1944,
1950). This “Methods of Cutting” (Krauch, 1916) was established by
Hermann Krauch (FVEF Forest Examiner) and C.F. Korstian (FVEF
Silviculturist), who initially divided the site into three harvesting
systems: seed tree (61 ha), group selection (56 ha), and light selec-
tion (45 ha and originally called “Shelterwood”). The objectives of
the seed tree system, an even-aged harvesting system, were to
leave 8–10 trees ha−1 uniformly distributed across the site as a seed
source and the removal of 80% of the sawtimber volume. The two
uneven-aged harvesting systems, group selection and light selec-
tion, were established in accordance with the historical harvesting
practices in the southwestern region and targeted the removal of
70 and 50% of the volume, respectively (Krauch, 1916). The site was
harvested by the Flagstaff Lumber Manufacturing Company in the
summer and fall of 1913.
In 1913, 7 permanent plots were established within each har-
vesting system for a total of 21 plots, which were remeasured every
5 years until 1943. These scientists/foresters found that the seed
tree method had the fewest tree seedlings after the initial harvest
in 1913, but by 1942, the seed tree method had the best reproduc-
tion. Interestingly, Schubert (1974) said that the seed tree method
was used successfully at Coulter Ranch because 1913 was a heavy
seed year, but no other successes were reported. Diameter growth
declined in the Coulter Ranch plots from 1913 to 1943 (Pearson,
1950). Thirty years after cutting, a large proportion of trees made
no growth or grew less than 1 in. in diameter. Trees in the scattered
seed tree cutting, where the heaviest volume was removed, had the
greatest initial diameter growth. Yet increment per acre was low in
this treatment because so few trees were retained in the stand, and
after 30 years average growth also declined. Released small trees
accounted for the high average growth during the ﬁrst 10 years for
all cutting methods.
We remeasured nine of these plots (Table 1), which range in
size from 0.8 to 1.9 ha. Criteria used for selecting plots for remea-
surement were: (1) plots with the largest extent were selected
to include three plots within each harvesting system and (2) at
least one of the plots selected had to be fenced and excluded
from livestock. These plots are identiﬁed using the original FVEF
naming system, comprised of a combination of letters and num-
bers representing the silvicultural unit (S5), individual permanent
plot designations (A, B, . . ., G), and the harvesting system (group
selection = 1, seed tree = 2, or light selection = 3). For example, S5B3
denotes permanent plot B in the light selection system (3) of the
Fort Valley Experimental Forest silviculture unit 5 (the Coulter
Ranch Unit).
In addition to examining the effects of different harvesting sys-
tems, the original 1913 study also excluded livestock on portions
of the plots (Fig. 1; Table 1). Unfortunately, budget constraints pre-
vented livestock exclusion from occurring simultaneously with plot
establishment. Following severe damage of pine reproduction from
livestock browsing between 1913 and 1918 (Allison, 1919), a por-
tion of each harvesting system was fenced in 1919.
2.3. Field measurements
All live trees with diameter at breast height (DBH; 1.37 m above
ground level) ≥9.14 cm (3.6 in.) were initially measured in 1913,
with tree condition, DBH, and other variables being recorded in
a ledger that is currently housed in the USFS Rocky Mountain
Research Station Fort Valley Archives, Flagstaff, Arizona. In addi-
tion, stem maps were created that included live tree locations,
location and stump diameter of trees harvested in 1913, loca-
tion of snags and logs, and the general location of seedlings and
oak patches. In brief, contemporary (2003–2006) ﬁeld methods
included the reestablishment of plot locations, measurement of
all evidence of living or dead tree structures, either presently or
at some past time reaching at least DBH, including x, y coordi-
nates to the nearest 0.1 m and 0.1◦using the Impulse 400 laser
rangeﬁnder and MapStar compass system (Laser Technology Inc.,
U.S.A.). Detailed descriptions of the historical and contemporary
ﬁeld methods, as well as additional descriptors of contemporary
conditions, are detailed by Moore et al. (2004), who reported for-
est structural reference conditions (size distributions, tree density
ranges, etc.) within a 1.01-ha subplot of S5A2, S5B3, and 13 addi-
tional permanent plots throughout Arizona and New Mexico.

(reconstructed), 1913 post-harvest (measured), and 2003–2006 (contemporary, measured) time scenarios.
2.4. Describing stand structure
To quantify how tree stand structure and spatial pattern
changed in the short-term (immediately following harvesting in
1913) and over the long-term (90+ years later), we examined the
forest stand structure and spatial patterns of three stand struc-
tural scenarios on each plot: (1) 1913 pre-harvest (reconstructed),
(2) 1913 post-harvest (measured) and (3) 2003–2006 (contem-
porary, measured). We focused our attention on trees ≥9.14 cm
DBH (3.6 in.) because detailed historical data were not collected
for smaller trees. All tree spatial coordinates were obtained during
contemporary measurements using a surveying laser. The historical
stem map was used to ensure that trees and stumps present at plot
establishment, or speciﬁcally noted on the historical maps, were
relocated correctly since numerous historical pieces of evidence
had undergone varying levels of decomposition.
To compare stand structure and spatial patterns among sce-
narios, we used the location (x–y coordinates), the historical stem
map, and size of all trees and stumps present in each scenario.
We obtained DBH data for the 2003–2006 scenario during con-

temporary measurements, while the post-harvest scenario data
were obtained from the 1913 plot ledgers. For the pre-harvest
scenario, we accounted for all pine trees harvested in 1913 and
determined the location and size of all oak trees. Since the area was
not harvested prior to the 1913, sizes of the pine stems harvested
were estimated by measuring the current diameter at stump height
(DSH: diameter at stump height or 30 cm) and applying DBH-DSH
regression models (Hann, 1976) to predict the corresponding DBH.
For the oak trees, we reconstructed the oak structure in 1913 fol-
lowing dendroecological methods described in detail by Fulé et al.
(1997). We assumed death dates of 1980 for all dead oak trees,
based on sensitivity analysis of reconstructed cut trees conducted
by Huffman et al. (2001), and because these trees were cut for
ﬁrewood and determining an exact death date was not possible.
2.5. Describing tree spatial patterns
Since spatial patterns are scale-dependent, we wanted to
describe the spatial patterns of trees at multiple scales on each
permanent plot for all three scenarios.
To determine whether the spatial pattern of individual trees
changed with scale observed and to describe their degree of
“patchiness”, we used the second-order univariate statistic, Rip-
ley’s K(t) (Ripley, 1976, 1977, 1981). The Ripley’s K(t) analysis
examines the spatial pattern of pairs of points within various
radial lag distances (t) to determine whether their distribution is
random (also called complete spatial randomness or CSR), aggre-
gated, or uniform (Upton and Fingleton, 1985; Legendre, 1993)
and K(t) provides insight into how these patterns change with
increasing scale (Upton and Fingleton, 1985; Dale, 1999). Cal-
culated values that fall outside of the conﬁdence interval are
statistically different from complete spatial randomness, with
values greater than 0 indicating aggregation and values less
than 0 indicating an uniform (regular) spatial pattern. We used
2-m lag distances and a maximum lag distance of half the
minimum dimension of each plot to reduce the error induced
by edge effects (Boots and Getis, 1988). Visual interpretation
was simpliﬁed using a square root, variance-stabilizing trans-
formation of K(t) to L(t) −t (Besag, 1977). Observed L(t) −t
values were tested for signiﬁcance at ˛ = 0.05 using 99 Monte
Carlo permutations (Upton and Fingleton, 1985), and average
second-order univariate statistics (Diggle, 2003) were computed
for harvesting system in each of the three stand structural
scenarios.

2.6. Describing tree recruitment patterns
In addition to the spatial pattern of individual trees, we wanted
to know if the residual stand structural patterns resulting from the
different harvesting systems inﬂuenced the recruitment of subse-
quent ponderosa pine cohorts. Speciﬁcally, we wanted to know if
the cohorts established: (1) under unharvested pine trees, (2) under
unharvested oak trees, (3) in openings created by tree harvest,
and/or (4) in natural grass openings. To examine these associa-
tions, we treated the residual trees after the 1913 harvests as one
antecedent population, the pine stumps resulting from these har-
vests as a second antecedent population, and the reconstructed oak
(in 1913) as the third antecedent population. The spatial relation-
ships between these three antecedent populations and the adult
trees that established prior to initial harvest were then examined
using Ripley’s K12(t) bivariate analysis (Lotwick and Silverman,
1982; Rowlingson and Diggle, 1993; Diggle, 2003). Ripley K12(t)
bivariate analysis was conducted and interpreted in the same
manner as the Ripley’s K(t) analysis, except that distances were cal-
culated between points of different populations and the conﬁdence
envelopes were formed by holding the locations of the antecedent
population constant while simulating 99 toroidal shifts of the loca-
tion of contemporary recruitment. This step tested a variation of
the independent point processes hypothesis (Goreaud and Pélissier,
2003) focusing on the spatial patterns of the contemporary pine
recruitment given the spatial pattern of the three antecedent pop-
ulations (McDonald et al., 2002, 2003). Ripley’s K(t) univariate
and Ripley’s K12(t) bivariate analyses were conducted using R
v.2.2.0 (R Development Core Team, 2005) and the splancs pack-
age (Rowlingson and Diggle, 1993; Bivand and Gebhardt, 2000).
Average second-order bivariate statistics were computed for each
antecedent hypothesis (e.g., pine cohorts established under unhar-
vested pine trees) for each of the three harvesting scenarios.
3. Results
3.1. Stand structure
Reconstructed live tree densities (≥9.14 cm DBH) in 1913 for
the pre-harvest scenario averaged 127.3 trees ha−1 (s = 26.9) and
ranged from 74.1 to 163.9 trees ha−1 (Table 2). On the plots that
were grazed (n = 5), the unharvested live tree density averaged
134.8 trees ha−1 (s = 22.8) and ranged from 112.4 to 163.9, while
those that were eventually excluded from livestock browsing (in
1919) averaged 118.0 trees ha−1 (s = 32.0) and ranged from 74.1 to
145.8. Mean basal area and DBH for all plots were 19.0 m2 ha−1
(s = 4.5) and 38.3 cm (s = 7.5), respectively.
The live pine tree (≥9.14 cm DBH) densities were reduced by an
average of 65% in the seed tree, 34% in the group selection, and 44%
in the light selection system immediately following their respective
1913 harvests. Residual (post-harvest) stand-level pine basal area
averaged 6.0 m2 ha−1 (s = 2.4) across all plots and ranged from 2.8 on

S5B2 to 10.3 on S5B3 (Table 2). These values correspond to a basal
area reduction of 77% in the seed tree, 61% in the group selection,
and 57% in the light selection system.
Contemporary (2003–2006) live tree (≥9.14 cm DBH) densities
of both pine and oak combined averaged 693.3 (s = 347.6) trees ha−1
and ranged from 316.3 to 1492.7 (Table 2). As compared to
the pre-harvest scenario, tree densities increased by an average
9.2 times in the seed tree, 4 times in the group selection, and
3.7 times in the light selection system. On the plots that were
grazed by livestock (n = 5), the contemporary tree densities (for
both pine and oak combined) averaged 516.2 trees ha−1 (s = 143.4),
while those that were excluded from livestock in 1919 (n = 4)
averaged 914.7 trees ha−1 (s = 420.9). Contemporary mean basal
area and DBH for all plots (regardless of grazing and browsing
history) had increased to 34.2 m2 ha−1 (s = 12.4) and decreased
to 21.0 cm (s = 5.1), respectively. Contemporary diameter distri-
butions (DBH ≥9.14 cm) tended to exhibit an inverse J-shaped
distribution (Fig. 2).
Total (pine and oak combined) diameter distributions (DBH
≥9.14 cm) prior to the 1913 harvest varied, but generally were
regularly distributed across all diameter classes (Fig. 2). All plots
had diameter distributions similar to those of multi-cohort stands
(Oliver and Larson, 1996), with oak comprising the majority of
the smallest diameter classes (10–30 cm). Several plots (esp. S5B2)
were missing or had low pine establishment in the smallest diam-
eter classes in 1913. S5A2 was missing the cohort of trees from
the 40 cm class while S5E2 and S5B3 had the lowest proportion of
oak in the 1913 pre-harvest scenario. Not surprisingly, the largest
diameter trees (>60 cm, see Fig. 2) were harvested in 1913 regard-
less of the harvesting system used, with group selection having the
least effect on the diameter distributions.
3.2. Tree spatial patterns
Live pine trees were signiﬁcantly aggregated under all scenarios
(Fig. 3), with trees being more strongly aggregated in the 1913 post-
harvest scenario (excluding S5B2, which exhibited CSR). In both
the pre- and post-harvest scenarios, the live pine tree locations
exhibited distinct peaks in aggregation from 4 to 16 m lag dis-
tances (e.g., Fig. 3a and d), indicating that historical patches of trees
were approximately 0.005–0.08 ha in size. However, on average
the heights of these peaks were much larger for the post-harvest
as compared to the pre-harvest scenario, indicating that the har-
vest exaggerated the patchiness of the stand (e.g., Fig. 3a and b). In
the pre-harvest scenario, trees were consistently aggregated at dis-
tances up to 10–18 m for the seed tree and light selection systems
and were aggregated at all scales sampled for the group selection
system. Also, the average maximum scale at which trees were found

to be aggregated and the corresponding average peak in aggrega-
tion changed little for the seed tree and light selection systems
(Fig. 3d and f), with the group selection system showing an increase
in peak aggregation from 7 to 23 m (Fig. 3e). In the 2003–2006 sce-
nario, trees were aggregated (except S5A2) at all spatial scales up
to the maximum distance tested for all systems (Fig. 3g–i). Broad
peaks were discernable and likely resulted from increases in patch
size through recruitment on previously unoccupied sites.
3.3. Tree recruitment patterns
Pine recruitment patterns over the past 90 years varied with har-
vest system, number of pine and oak stems, and pine stumps (Fig. 4).
The pine recruitment patterns exhibited a: (1) negative association
or repulsion with the unharvested live pine tree locations at scales
under 15 m for seed tree, all scales for group selection, and under
32 m for light selection systems (i.e., Fig. 4a–c, respectively); (2)
positive association or aggregation with pine stump locations on
all sites at varying lag distances (e.g., Fig. 4e); and (3) random asso-
ciation (CSR) with the locations of the reconstructed live oak trees
at all scales sampled, except in the light selection where repulsion
was observed (Fig. 4i). The spatial association among pine recruit-
ment in the seed tree system was randomly associated with the
few remaining unharvested pine (<31 trees ha−1), but a few plots
showed a negative association at small distances (Fig. 4a). S5B2,
which was the most intensely harvested plot sampled (residual
density of 10.7 trees ha−1), shows how initial seedlings established
near pine stumps, while later cohorts colonized the plot indiscrim-
inately (Fig. 5 and repeat photos Fig. 6).
More pronounced patterns were found on the plots that received
group selection and light selection harvests (Fig. 4). For these sys-
tems (n = 6), pine recruitment exhibited a negative association with
the live pine trees and a positive association with pine stumps.
Random associations with live oak trees were found at all scales
sampled across all plots except S5G1 and S5B3, which exhibited
small-scale (≤8 m) positive association and too few oak to make
any inferences, respectively. The establishment of initial cohorts
in the newly created openings (stump patches) was well docu-
mented by the stem-mapped data and repeat photography for the
group selection (Figs. 7 and 8) and for the light selection system
(Figs. 9 and 10). Initial and subsequent cohorts appeared to be rarely
recruited directly under unharvested live pine trees.
4. Discussion
Harvesting systems used and livestock exclusion in the early
1900s increased tree densities and exaggerated the patchiness of
the ponderosa pine–Gambel oak stands examined in this study.
Both pine and oak densities increased due to harvest, but the seed
tree system had the largest increase and the light selection system
had the least. Tree density was greatest on plots where livestock
browsing was excluded, regardless of harvest method. Lastly, over
the past 90 years, post-harvest pine recruitment occurred most
commonly in interspaces or canopy gap (either on a stump patch
or in a natural grass opening) and away from older, live trees or
residual tree patches.
4.1. Stand structure, tree spatial patterns and recruitment
Contemporary stand conditions, which include increased den-
sity and smaller trees, most likely resulted from numerous pulses of
pine establishment in the early 1900s (Pearson, 1950; Savage et al.,
1996) following heavy livestock grazing, ﬁre exclusion, and inten-
sive harvesting systems (e.g., seed tree system). Intense grazing
provided favorable seedbeds for seedling establishment, similar to
those created historically by frequent surface ﬁres or more recently
by harvesting, and when combined with ﬁre exclusion would allow
an unusually high density of trees to become established and per-

sist (Pearson, 1950; Cooper, 1960; White, 1985; Mast et al., 1999;
Moore et al., 2004; Bakker and Moore, 2007). This density would
have included a cohort that established after the last ﬁre event prior
to Euro-American ﬁre exclusion. In northern Arizona pine forests
around Flagstaff, it appears that following ﬁre exclusion and ini-
tial disturbance, new cohorts initiated in waves of establishment
until growing space was fully utilized in the 1940s, then recruit-
ment essentially stopped (Sánchez Meador et al., 2010). Comparing
the stand structure of the 1913 pre-harvest scenario to presettle-
ment conditions reported for nearby areas, pine and oak densities
on our study area were greater than the 43 pine trees ha−1 and
4 oak trees ha−1 found by Covington and Moore (1994) at Bar-M
Canyon, the 43 pine trees ha−1 found by Fulé et al. (1997), and
within the range of 62–72 pine trees ha−1 found by Fulé et al. (2002)
for sites on the south rim of Grand Canyon National Park. Further-

relatively high densities of small-diameter oaks, which was simi-
lar to the conditions found on several plots examined in this study
(S5A2, S5C1, S5F3). Fulé et al. (1997) hypothesized that since Gam-
bel oak reproduces vegetatively and is highly susceptible to ﬁre, it
is likely that many or most of these small trees would have been
thinned had ﬁres continued after ﬁre exclusion and that the density
of larger oaks may be more representative of the long-term average
oak density under a continuing frequent ﬁre regime. Their estimate
of presettlement oak density over 10 cm DBH was 33 oaks ha−1 and
very near to those reported in this study.
The observed increase in ponderosa pine and Gambel oak tree
density by 2003–2006 is consistent with the structural changes in
ponderosa pine ecosystems reported throughout Arizona (Cooper,
1960; White, 1985; Covington and Moore, 1994; Fulé et al.,
1997, 2002; Mast et al., 1999; Moore et al., 2004) and in related
long-needled pine ecosystems throughout western North Amer-
ica (Covington et al., 1994; Harrod et al., 1999; Youngblood et
al., 2004). The contemporary density of ponderosa pine is very
close to the 1997–1999 average of 520 trees ha−1 reported by
Moore et al. (2004) for Arizona and New Mexico, but less than
the 690–956 trees ha−1 range reported by Fulé et al. (2002) for
the south rim of Grand Canyon National Park, the 1900 trees ha−1
reported by Covington and Moore (1994) at Bar-M Canyon, and the
720 trees ha−1 reported by Fulé et al. (1997) for the Camp Navajo
Army National Guard facility. Contemporary oak densities reported
were very similar to the 156 trees ha−1 reported at Bar-M Canyon
(Covington and Moore, 1994) and the average 138–182 oaks ha−1
reported by Barger and Ffolliott (1972) in a central Arizona pon-
derosa forest.
Historically, unharvested stands on this study site were com-
posed of tree patches averaging 0.005–0.08 ha in size with
interspaces heavily browsed by livestock. The contemporary stand
structure, all sites and regardless of harvesting system used, may
be best characterized as a single large patch (≥1.9 ha). Over the last
90+ years, however, tree patch size has generally increased and
the plots at this research site, as with most ponderosa pine forest
across northern Arizona, have become homogenized with respect
to spatial pattern. The observed increase in tree density over time
is likely due to an increase in the number of tree patches (recruit-
ment of new patches) rather than tree recruitment into pre-harvest
patches.
Our results suggested that pine recruitment patterns varied
both between and among areas that received different harvests,
but was highest in interspaces or canopy gap openings produced
by either intensive tree removal, slash accumulation, or pre-
existing grass openings that were heavily grazed by livestock.
The results of the spatial analysis and the trends captured by
repeat photography series suggest that post-harvest recruitment
patterns were not spatially random and pine seedlings initially
established in the interspaces, and were followed closely there-
after by cohorts establishing around stumps created in 1913.
Several of the plots within the study site were fenced in 1919,
which in turn, likely released these pine seedlings from browsing
and/or trampling and contributed to the increased tree densi-
ties seen on these sites today (Pearson, 1950; Bakker and Moore,
2007).
4.2. Constraints of historical data – Fort Valley Experimental
Forest
Clear differences were observed in tree patterns among the
three harvesting systems. The ability to draw causal inferences is
limited by the lack of treatment replication, a common problem
in assessing change using retrospective studies (Carpenter, 1990)
and case studies in general. However, the original FVEF researchers
recognized the need to install plots that captured the variability of
the site (elevation, slope, slope position, initial tree densities), thus
permitting inferences on the inﬂuence of tree patterns with respect
to harvesting system.
One concern with any study is the size of the sample plot relative
to the spatial scale of the process of interest (Dale, 1999). Our plots
ranged from 0.8 to 1.9 ha, and likely captured all individual tree and

patch patterns because: (1) the smallest extent examined (0.8 ha)
was three times greater than the maximum patch size (0.29 ha)
reported by White (1985), and (2) the minimum lag distance exam-
ined on all sites (40 m) was equal to or larger than those reported
for similar studies (e.g., Mast and Veblen, 1999; Boyden et al., 2005).
Another sampling issue is the small sample size of plots, clus-
tered together in one area, which only represent 14% of the
Coconino National Forest. And, lastly, since the plots we used in
this study had different harvesting and grazing histories, do they
represent either the historical and/or the contemporary forest? The
latter two issues raise concerns about the applicability of our case
study results to the larger, heterogeneous landscape of ponderosa
pine forests in northern Arizona (Bell et al., 2008). However, Moore
et al. (2000) and Bell et al. (2008) showed that these historical per-
manent plots were representative in structure and composition of
the broader region (basalt parent material) in the historical con-
text, lending some degree of support to extrapolating inferences
about historical small-scale spatial patterns observed on these
plots. Finally, it should be noted that these data do not represent
presettlement reference conditions (sensu Kaufmann et al., 1994;
Morgan et al., 1994; Fulé et al., 1997; Moore et al., 1999) since
the 1913 pre-harvest scenarios embodies some 30+ years of ﬁre
exclusion and livestock grazing.
5. Management implications and “lessons learned”
The long-term changes in forest structure and spatial patterns
reported for this ponderosa pine–Gambel oak site in northern
Arizona add to our understanding of how contemporary forest
conditions developed and inform management for future condi-
tions (Foster et al., 2003). Understanding these land-use activities
and their enduring consequences on forest structure and spatial
patterns, decades later after they have occurred, can increase the
effectiveness of management (Swetnam et al., 1999). In contrast,
ignoring land-use legacies may lead to the development of ill-
conceived restoration and management schemes (Foster, 2002).
Long-term, permanent plots are essential for detecting and
quantifying ecosystem changes over time and provide a context
for interpreting these changes (Likens, 1989; Leigh and Johnston,
1994). Various agents, such as ﬁre exclusion, harvest history, live-
stock grazing, climate change, etc., may be implicated in plant
population change or decline, but cause and effect are not easily
demonstrated without data from long-term studies (Christensen,
1989; Spellerberg, 1991; Leigh and Johnston, 1994). The study
described here from the USFS Fort Valley Experimental Forest
demonstrates how some ecological and management questions can
only be addressed using long-term data and permanent plots.
