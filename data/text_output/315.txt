Forest Stand Characteristics Altered by Restoration
Affect Western Bluebird Habitat Quality
Catherine S. Wightman1,2 and Stephen S. Germaine1,3
Abstract
Forest managers are setting Ponderosa pine (Pinus pon-
derosa) forests in the southwestern United States on a tra-
jectory toward a restored ecosystem by reducing tree
densities and managing with prescribed ﬁre. The process
of restoration dramatically alters forest stands, and the ef-
fects of these changes on wildlife remain unclear. Our
research evaluated which aspects of habitat alteration
from restoration treatments may be affecting the habitat
quality of Western Bluebird (Sialia mexicana), an insec-
tivorous songbird whose populations are declining. Habi-
tat loss resulting from ﬁre-suppression activities may be
partially responsible for their population declines; thus,
the bluebird is a good representative species for assessing
how the reconstruction of presuppression forest condi-
tions can affect wildlife. We measured habitat variables at
63 successful and 19 unsuccessful Western Bluebird nests
in 1999–2001 and 2003. We compared habitat models that
represented bluebird biology and habitat changes from
restoration. Two models of nest success that included (1)
an increased herbaceous and bare ground cover and (2)
increased Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) densities and
reduced Ponderosa pine densities were most supported by
the data. Increased herbaceous ground cover and Gambel
oak density likely represent improved invertebrate as-
semblages and thus improved forage abundance for nest-
ing bluebirds. Lower Ponderosa pine densities may
provide bluebirds with open perches from which to hunt
and thereby improve the availability of invertebrates as
a food source. We also provide a landscape-scale example
of changes to bluebird habitat quality from treatments,
which we recommend as a useful tool in restoration
planning.

Introduction
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of the southwest-
ern United States have changed dramatically over the past
century, primarily in response to grazing, logging, and ﬁre
suppression (Covington & Moore 1994). Currently, Ponder-
osa pine forests tend to be composed of single-age stands,
which lack structural and compositional diversity. These
homogeneous, dense forests are stressed by competition for
resources and bark beetle infestations and are increasingly
vulnerable to high-intensity wildﬁre. There is also less
growth and diversity of herbaceous plants and lower soil
moisture in current condition forests when compared with
conditions prior to Euro-American settlement (Covington
et al. 1997). In an attempt to improve ecosystem functions
and restore natural ﬁre regimes within Ponderosa pine for-
ests, restoration prescriptions are currently being imple-
mented at varying scales throughout the southwestern
United States (Covington et al. 1997; Allen et al. 2002).
The pre-settlement model of restoration is one such
prescription that is being applied in southwestern Ponder-
osa pine forests (Covington et al. 1997). This prescription
uses conditions prior to Euro-American settlement (pre-
1870) as a baseline for reconstruction. The treatments
involve mechanical thinning to reduce Ponderosa pine den-
sities and prescribed ﬁre to reduce organic litter accumula-
tion and allow herbaceous plants to reestablish (Korb &
Springer 2003).
These changes will affect wildlife in various ways (Allen
et al. 2002). For example, thinning may reduce vertical
structure for nesting or foraging birds, but an increase in
herbaceous vegetation may provide improved foraging
conditions for herbivores and insectivores (Chambers &
Germaine 2003). When developing forest restoration plans,
it is critical to identify and manage the structural and
compositional features of the forest that are important to
wildlife (Lindenmayer & Franklin 2002). Important or
good-quality habitats for wildlife can be measured, in part,
by the reproductive success and/or survival rates of the occu-
pants (Van Horne 1983; Clark & Shutler 1999). Therefore,
models identifying habitat features associated with repro-
ductive success for wildlife species can function as an index
to habitat quality and as a tool for restoration planning.
Western Bluebird (Sialia mexicana), a cavity-nesting,
ground-foraging, insectivorous songbird, was historically
associated with open pine–oak forests of the western
United States (Grinnell et al. 1930; Bent 1949; Guinan
et al. 2000). Western Bluebird populations are declining
in parts of their range (Sauer et al. 2005), and this may

be a result of the dense forest conditions created by
ﬁre-suppression activities (Guinan et al. 2000). Germaine
and Germaine (2002) found that bluebirds ﬂedged more
young
on
restoration-treated
forest
plots
than
on
untreated ones. In addition, bluebird density and repro-
ductive success in northern Arizona was higher in moder-
ately thinned forest stands (Szaro 1976; Brawn & Balda
1988; Brawn 1991). Thus, forest restoration may improve
habitat conditions for bluebirds by reducing pine densities.
However, bluebirds may respond to forest changes in addi-
tion to reduced tree densities, and it is unclear whether
there are other forest features altered by restoration such
as changes to the herbaceous ground cover that may be im-
portant to bluebirds. In our study we attempted to identify
which characteristics altered by treatments may function
as proximate factors of Western Bluebird nest success.
We evaluated associations between Western Bluebird
reproductive success and habitat characteristics on the for-
est stand and nest-site scale. Our objectives were to (1)
identify model(s) of habitat features altered by restoration
that best predicted nest success; (2) identify habitat fea-
tures altered by restoration that were associated with nest
productivity; and (3) model the changes in habitat quality
after treatments were implemented across a landscape.
Methods
Study Area
We conducted this research on the Grand Canyon-
Parashant National Monument in northwestern Arizona
(lat 36239N, long 113099W; 1,980–2,196 m in elevation).
Ponderosa pine and Ponderosa pine–deciduous forests
dominated the study area. Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii)
and New Mexican locust (Robinia neomexicana) were the
primary deciduous species. Quaking aspen (Populus tremu-
loides) was present in a few localized patches. Pinyon pine
(Pinus edulis) and Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma)
were forest components in the lower and drier areas.
Our 7.4-km2 study area was managed using ﬁre suppres-
sion, logging, and cattle grazing for the past century. Prior
to restoration treatments, 70% of the ground cover was
litter and duff, and only 15% was live plants (A. E. M.
Waltz & P. Z. Fule´, Ecological Restoration Institute,
2001, unpublished data). Total tree density on a represen-
tative subset of the study area prior to treatments aver-
aged approximately 1,370 trees/ha (Waltz et al. 2003).
Restoration treatments involved a prescription of thin-
ning using pre-1870 reference conditions, burning, and
reseeding (see Covington et al. 1997 and Waltz et al. 2003
for details). All living Ponderosa pines older than 120
years were retained. For each instance of pre-1870 tree
evidence, such as snags, stumps, or logs, three Ponderosa
pines were retained if the trees were less than 40.6 cm in
diameter at breast height (dbh). For trees greater than
40.6 dbh, three trees were retained for every two instances
of pre-1870 tree evidence. Merchantable thinned trees were
removed, and smaller trees were lopped and scattered
across the plot. All thinned areas were then treated to
a controlled broadcast burn to reduce fuel loads and stim-
ulate herbaceous production. Seed was applied after burn-
ing to help native plants reestablish. Gambel oak was not
thinned, but some mortality occurred from prescribed ﬁre.
Approximately 202 ha of Ponderosa pine–Gambel oak
forest were treated. A control area of approximately 511
ha in the southeast portion of the study area, along with
two 10- to 30-ha blocks imbedded in the landscape of trea-
ted areas, was not treated (Fig. 1). Density of Ponderosa
pines in treated plots averaged 146.3 ± 28.5 (SE) trees/ha
and in untreated plots averaged 644.8 ± 95.2 (SE) trees/ha
(Roccaforte 2005). In a comparison of restoration-treated
and untreated experimental blocks on the study area, thin-
ning of Ponderosa pines reduced tree density by an aver-
age of 77% (range 68–85%) and canopy cover was
reduced from 56 to 35% (posttreatment range 22–53%;
Waltz et al. 2003).
Reproductive Success
We searched for nesting Western Bluebirds in 1999–2001
and 2003 in treated and untreated habitats. Nests were not

monitored adequately in 2002 because of budget con-
straints; therefore, we did not include nests from 2002 in
our analyses. Observers walked systematically through
each plot beginning at dawn and followed pairs of Western
Bluebirds until nesting sites were located (Ralph et al. 1993).
Behavioral cues, such as an adult carrying nesting material
or food to a cavity, were used to identify nesting locations.
Observers alternated days between treated and untreated
habitat to ensure equal coverage. We typically monitored
active nests every 3–4 days until we determined nest fate
(i.e., success or failure). We included only those nests that
were accessible using a 5-m-tall ladder and used a small
ﬂashlight and mirror to conﬁrm a nesting attempt and iden-
tify nest contents. Western bluebirds used some nests in
more than one year. For these nests, we used nest success and
habitat data from the ﬁrst year the nest was found only.
To estimate productivity, we used the number of young
in the nest on the last day prior to ﬂedge. We summed
productivity within a year if a nest produced two clutches
and then averaged among years that the nest was moni-
tored. This yielded one estimate of productivity for each
nesting cavity, which we compared with habitat data from
the ﬁrst year the nest was found.
Habitat Measures
We measured eight habitat variables at two spatial scales:
the nest site and forest stand. Nest site characteristics
describe features that bluebirds may use to select the nest
tree and cavity (third-order selection; Johnson 1980). We
recorded dbh of the nest tree and height of the nest cavity.
Forest stand characteristics describe the general forest habi-
tat conditions surrounding nest sites or second-order selec-
tion. We centered two 50-m transects on the nest tree in
cardinal directions and tallied ground cover by point inter-
cept at 1-m intervals. We tallied overstory coniferous can-
opy cover at 2.5-m intervals. To estimate the relative
density of tree species, we conducted 6-m-wide belt trans-
ects along the 50-m transects and tallied the number of trees
by species. Trees in the center where transects overlapped
were counted once. We estimated the density per hectare
of each tree species by summing the total number of trees
by species and dividing by the area sampled (0.0564 ha).
Habitat Models
We chose an information-theoretic approach to identify
and select the best models of reproductive success (Burn-
ham & Anderson 2002). This approach allowed us to use
our knowledge of Western Bluebird biology to build and
compare habitat models that were based on habitat changes
from forest restoration. Our models were built after prelim-
inary data analysis suggested that an information-theoretic
approach was the best technique for interpreting our data.
We identiﬁed two sets of six models (Table 1) contain-
ing habitat variables altered by restoration and likely to
inﬂuence Western Bluebird nest success or productivity.
The models in each set contained the same predictor
variables, described below, but the response variable was
different among sets.
Model 1 included the ground cover variables percent
forbs, grasses, and bare ground. These variables were
selected because increases in the abundance of herba-
ceous vegetation, which is a desired outcome of treat-
ments, are strongly correlated with increases in the
abundance of invertebrates (Murdoch et al. 1972; Polis
et al. 1997; Haddad et al. 2001), which are the primary
food source of Western Bluebirds. Bare ground was in-
cluded because it may represent ground cover conditions
where litter has not accumulated or has been reduced
through prescribed ﬁre and may allow herbaceous plants
to establish (Korb & Springer 2003). Bare ground may
also create spaces between herbaceous vegetation that
facilitates the capture of invertebrates.
Model 2 included the density of Ponderosa pine and
Gambel oak. Western Bluebirds typically use a ‘‘perch-
forage’’ technique to capture invertebrates, which involves
perching low on trees to ﬁnd available prey on the ground
(Guinan et al. 2000). Perches that provide open views of
the surrounding ground will likely increase capture suc-
cess. We suspected that a reduction in Ponderosa pine
density would increase the number of perches with open
views and thus the amount of invertebrates available for
capture. Although Gambel oak was not thinned during
restoration treatments, some mortality occurred from pre-
scribed ﬁre, especially during initial treatments when
there were high fuel loads on the ground. We included
Gambel oak as a tree density variable because 81% of
nesting attempts were in cavities in Gambel oak (n ¼ 43)
or Gambel oak snags (n ¼ 13). In addition, Hayward
(1948) found six times as many invertebrates under oaks
than in surrounding areas and 30 times more invertebrates
under oaks than under either herbaceous low shrubs or
tall shrubs (Leidolf et al. 2000). Thus, Gambel oak likely
plays an important role in Western Bluebird ecology.
Model 3 included the variable percent canopy cover of
overstory coniferous trees. We selected this variable as

the best comprehensive descriptor of restoration treat-
ments. We included this model to evaluate whether the
combination of increased forage abundance (more herba-
ceous vegetation) and increased forage availability (more
open perches) was the best predictor of Western Bluebird
nest success or productivity. We could not combine varia-
bles in models 1 and 2 directly because of collinearity
among predictor variables (Hosmer & Lemeshow 1989)
and constraints on the number of variables in each model
due to sample size (Williams & Titus 1988).
Model 4 included the variables nest tree dbh and cavity
height. We included this model to assess whether changes
in the vertical forest structure, i.e., fewer small trees,
might affect bluebird nest success by inﬂuencing nest
placement. We expected that cavities in larger trees far-
ther off the ground might be more protected from nest
predators and thus provide improved reproductive bene-
ﬁts to the nesting pair.
Model 5 included a single variable, density of Ponder-
osa pine. This variable was selected because it is the most
common descriptor of forest changes resulting from resto-
ration or fuel-reduction treatments. Although we suspect
that Western Bluebirds are responding to a combination
of habitat alterations created by a reduction in Ponderosa
pine densities and prescribed ﬁre, we assessed this model
to determine whether it can be used as a predictor of res-
toration effects on Western Bluebird habitat quality.
Our last
model included
only the
intercept. We
included this model for comparative purposes because
support for the intercept-only model would imply that
nest survival was not a function of the habitat variables
measured (Burnham & Anderson 2002).
Nest Success Analysis and Model Selection
We used the logistic-exposure method to predict daily nest
survival for each of the six models described above
(Shaffer 2004). This method is similar to logistic regression,
except it accounts for nests that might have been missed
early in the nesting season. Our data met the assumptions
of independence and homogeneity of daily survival rates
among the same values of predictor values required by the
logistic-exposure method. For each nest, we calculated
exposure days, or the number of days between when the
nest was found and when its fate was determined (i.e., nest-
lings ﬂedged or nest failed). We included the number of
exposure days for each nest in the link function of each
logistic regression (see Shaffer 2004 for details). Our logis-
tic-exposure models, then, provided us with a daily, rather
than a seasonal, probability of nest survival.
To identify which models were the best predictors of
nest success, we used Akaike’s Information Criterion
(AIC; Burnham & Anderson 2002) to compare the six
models of daily nest survival. A lower AIC score indicated
that a model contained more information than competing
models with higher scores. Because we had a relatively
large number of parameters in our models with respect to
sample size, we used AICc, which was a second-level
adjustment that included a bias correction term. We con-
sidered all models with AICc values less than or equal to
2.0, which is the difference between the lowest AICc score
and the AICc score for that model, to be supported by the
data and thus, good predictors of nest survival. We also
calculated the AIC weight (wi), which is the likelihood
that each model compared with the other models in the
set was the best model (Burnham & Anderson 2002).
Higher wi values indicated stronger support for that model
relative to the others.
For the models supported by the data, we presented the
parameter estimates (b) and SE of each variable and the
model intercept. These estimates allowed us to calculate
the probability of nest survival for different values of the
habitat variables. We calculated the 95% Wald conﬁdence
limits for each parameter estimate to provide an estimate
of the sampling variability for each variable (Allison
1999). Because there was not a linear relationship
between the habitat variables and probability of nest sur-
vival using the logistic-exposure method, we also calcu-
lated the odds ratio for each variable. The odds ratio
reﬂects the change in odds of nest survival for each unit
change of the variable while controlling for the other vari-
ables in the model (Hosmer & Lemeshow 2000).
We also calculated threshold values associated with nest
survival for the habitat features in our best models. We
pooled the forb, grass, and bare ground cover variables
and estimated 95% conﬁdence limits to identify a lower
bound that was associated with nest survival. To identify
a threshold of tree densities, we used the logistic-exposure
model to calculate a probability of daily nest survival with
different combinations of tree density values. By raising
the daily probability of nest survival to the 35 days
required for a successful breeding attempt (14 days incu-
bation 1 21 days nestling period ¼ 35 days; Guinan et al.
2000), we adjusted the probability of daily nest survival to
the probability of a successful breeding attempt (Mayﬁeld
1975). We reported combinations of Ponderosa pine and
Gambel oak densities that provided a greater than or
equal to 50% probability of a successful breeding attempt.
Productivity Analysis and Model Selection
We used linear regression to evaluate the relationship
between productivity and the six models described above
(Zar 1996). We again compared models using AICc and
wi to identify the model(s) that best represent the relation-
ship between productivity and forest habitat conditions, as
described above. We calculated the adjusted r2 value of
each linear regression model to evaluate the strength of
the relationship between habitat variables and productiv-
ity (Zar 1996).
Landscape-Scale Application of Model
Our third objective was to model the changes to Western
Bluebird habitat quality after treatments were implemented

across a landscape. For this exercise, we selected the
logistic-exposure model of daily nest survival described
above that was supported by the data and contained
variables that were relatively easy for forest managers to
measure across the landscape.
For our landscape modeling, we used vegetative data
collected from a 300-m grid system overlaid on the study
area (Roccaforte 2005). Plots, 50 3 20 m, were centered on
each grid point, and the long axes of the plot paralleled the
primary direction of the slope to correct plot area for slope
angle. The total number of trees, by species, in a plot was
tallied and then adjusted by area to indicate the number
of trees per hectare by species. Data were collected before
and after restoration treatments had been completed.
We entered tree density estimates from the landscape
data into our model of nest success to calculate the proba-
bility of daily nest survival for each 300-m grid point. We
adjusted for a 35-day breeding season (described above)
and plotted the probability of a successful breeding
attempt at each 300-m grid point in a Geographical Infor-
mation Systems (GIS). We assigned probabilities to forest
habitat between the grid points, in 25-m increments, based
on the probabilities of all grid points within a 500-m radius
of each grid point. We created two maps, one predicting
nest success in forest habitat prior to restoration treat-
ments and one predicting nest success after treatments.
Because the boundaries between treated and untreated
forest were discrete breaks in habitat, grid points within
500 m of a center point but in a different treatment type
were not included in estimating a probability for that 25-m
cell. We classiﬁed cells with a less than 50% probability of
nest success as poor-quality habitat and cells with a greater
than or equal to 50% probability of nest success as good-
quality habitat.
Results
Nest Success
We monitored nests and measured habitat at 63 successful
and 19 unsuccessful Western Bluebird nests from 1999 to
2001 and in 2003 (Table 2). Of the six logistic-exposure
models, two models had the strongest support for predict-
ing Western Bluebird nest survival (Table 3). The best
model (wi ¼ 0.50) contained the ground cover variables of
percent grasses, forbs, and bare ground. The model con-
taining the variables tree densities of Ponderosa pine and
Gambel oak was also weighted relatively high (wi ¼ 0.33)
and thus was also a good predictor of nest survival. The
model that included only the variable density of Ponder-
osa pine trees was moderately supported by the data but
was not considered one of the best models because its
AICc was greater than 2.0. Nest site descriptors, canopy
cover, and the intercept-only model were relatively poor
predictors of nest survival.
The odds ratio for the variables in the best models indi-
cated that for every 1% increase in grasses, forbs, or bare
ground in the ground cover, the odds of daily nest survival
increased by 5, 9, or 13%, respectively (Table 4). For each
1% increase in the density of Ponderosa pine trees, the
odds of daily nest survival decreased by 0.3%. Increases in
Gambel oak tree densities were positively associated with
nest survival; a 1% increase in Gambel oak increased the
daily nest survival rate by 0.2%. When considered across
a 35-day nesting season, these habitat changes can have
a substantial inﬂuence on nest success.
The lower 95% conﬁdence limit for ground cover varia-
bles at successful nests were 7, 5, and 8% for grasses,
forbs, and bare ground, respectively. Thus, at least 20% of
the ground cover should be a combination of grasses,
forbs, and bare soil to provide good-quality habitat for
bluebirds. Using our tree density model, we calculated
a habitat-quality threshold of 270 Ponderosa pine trees/ha
if Gambel oak densities were zero. Ponderosa pine densi-
ties at or below this threshold produced conditions favor-
able
for
successful
breeding
attempts
by
Western
Bluebirds. As the proportion of Gambel oak increased,
higher densities of Ponderosa pine provided good-quality
bluebird habitat. For example, average oak densities on

our study site were approximately 200 stems/ha (Rocca-
forte 2005). At this density of oak, habitat with approxi-
mately 400 Ponderosa pine trees/ha would be classiﬁed as
good-quality bluebird habitat.
Productivity
Four of the six linear regression models developed to
assess the relationship between habitat and productivity
performed equally well (Table 5). These models included
ground cover, tree density, and canopy cover variables.
However, the amount of variation explained by the best
models was relatively low (r2
a ¼ 0.07–0.12), which indi-
cates that these models cannot solely explain differences
in productivity.
Landscape-Scale Application of Model
We used the model containing the variable Ponderosa
pine and Gambel oak densities to map the nest success of
Western Bluebirds across the landscape of the study area.
When applied in our untreated forest, 41% (302 ha) of the
surveyed area was classiﬁed as good-quality habitat
(50% probability of nest success) for Western Bluebirds
(Fig. 2a). With the completion of treatments on a portion
of the study area, the amount of good-quality habitat
increased to 393 ha or 53% of the surveyed area (Fig. 2b).
With few exceptions, the treated areas were classiﬁed as
good-quality Western Bluebird habitat.
Discussion
Forest restoration can improve Western Bluebird habitat
(Germaine & Germaine 2002); however, the complex and
often simultaneous changes to forests from treatments can
make it difﬁcult to determine which of the observed
changes are responsible for habitat improvement. We
found that treatment-induced changes to the ground cover
and tree densities were positive inﬂuences on bluebird
nest success. Using our models, we identiﬁed speciﬁc
thresholds for managing bluebird habitat. We also created
maps of our study area that reﬂected the expected changes
to bluebird habitat from treatments.
Changes to the ground cover and tree densities from
treatments may be important determinants in bluebird
habitat quality, in part, by inﬂuencing foraging opportuni-
ties. Food supply can directly inﬂuence the number of
young produced per pair in a variety of bird species (Mar-
tin 1987; Newton 1998), and a more abundant and avail-
able invertebrate population would provide Western
Bluebirds with more food resources for developing nest-
lings. The combination of increased herbaceous vegeta-
tion and bare ground resulting from treatments may
provide an abundant and diverse community of ground
invertebrates (Haddad et al. 2001) for bluebirds to exploit.
Lower Ponderosa pine densities associated with treat-
ments may improve prey availability by providing blue-
birds with more open perches for scanning for prey
(Guinan et al. 2000). The presence of Gambel oak also
was important in bluebird habitat quality, probably
because of its positive association with invertebrates
(Leidolf et al. 2000), its importance as nesting substrate
(this study), and perching beneﬁts. Thus, restoration treat-
ments that enhance or maintain Gambel oak are likely to
be beneﬁcial to bluebirds.
Other
factors,
such
as
habitat
heterogeneity
and
weather (Herlugson 1980; Brawn 1991), may also affect
reproductive success of Western Bluebirds. For example,

Lewis’
Woodpecker
(Melanerpes

nests
varied
between habitat types. Alterations to the nest predator
assemblages and differences in predation rates in treated
and untreated forest habitat may be partially responsible
for our results. However, of failed nests in our study, more
than 25% (5 of 19) contained abandoned nestlings. This
suggests that other factors, such as food availability, also
may be important inﬂuences on bluebird nest success.
Weather can inﬂuence nest success (Brawn 1991), possibly
through prolonged exposure to suboptimal conditions or
improved food resources during the spring. Annual pre-
cipitation varied little (average ¼ 14.7 ± 1.7 SE inches/
year; WRCC 2005) during the years we sampled; thus, we
were unable to evaluate the interaction between weather
and habitat features. In years of extreme weather events,
variations in habitat may become more or less important.
A primary outcome of restoration treatments is a signiﬁ-
cant reduction in Ponderosa pine densities (Waltz et al.
2003), and a desired outcome is an improved herbaceous
community (Covington & Moore 1994). We found that
treatments that increase or maintain at least 20% of
a ground cover composed of grasses, forbs, and bare soil
should improve bluebird habitat. We also found that den-
sities of Ponderosa pine less than or equal to 270 trees/ha
improve habitat conditions for nesting Western Bluebirds,
if Gambel oak trees are not present. Areas with high
Gambel oak densities can provide good-quality bluebird
habitat with even higher Ponderosa pine densities. How-
ever, we were unable to identify a lower threshold, below
which tree densities become too low to provide good-
quality bluebird habitat. Brawn and Balda (1988) found
that Western Bluebird density was higher in thinned plots
with 208–217 Ponderosa pine trees/ha than in open plots
with 52–57 Ponderosa pine trees/ha. The reduction in
perch trees for foraging may be responsible for the lower
densities of Western Bluebirds in open habitats (Guinan
et al. 2000). Ponderosa pine density for successful nests on
our study area averaged 150 trees/ha. Therefore, treat-
ments that reduce Ponderosa pine densities below a lower
threshold, ranging somewhere between 57 and 150 trees/
ha, may reduce the quality of bluebird habitat rather than
improve it, especially in the absence of Gambel oak.
We offer one important caveat to the use of tree density
as an indicator of Western Bluebird habitat quality. If
established, invasive, herbaceous species could reduce the
quality of the ground cover conditions for Western Blue-
birds despite a reduction in tree densities. Cheatgrass
(Bromus tectorum) is a noxious invader common on trea-
ted sites in our study area (C. S. Wightman & S. S. Ger-
maine, Arizona Game and Fish Department, 2003, personal
observations; A. E. M. Waltz, Ecological Restoration Insti-
tute, 2001, unpublished data). Cheatgrass is a very successful
competitor (Evans et al. 2001; Sieg et al. 2003), and once
invaded, a system can become homogeneously dominated
by cheatgrass and remain in this state indeﬁnitely (Pierson
& Mack 1990). Because insect diversity is correlated with
ground cover heterogeneity (Murdoch et al. 1972; Haddad
Figure 2. The probability (<50% or 50%) of nest success of

et al. 2001), a homogeneous cheatgrass ground cover could
reduce the diversity of invertebrate prey available to West-
ern Bluebirds. Thus, although we offer our tree density
model as a useful index to Western Bluebird habitat quality
for restoration planning, we do not recommend using it as
a substitute for monitoring ground cover conditions when
assessing restoration treatments.
Management Recommendations
Forest restoration treatments that stimulate herbaceous
vegetation, decrease Ponderosa pine densities, and main-
tain or enhance Gambel oak densities can improve the
reproductive success of Western Bluebirds in areas where
suitable nest cavities exist. The restoration treatment we
examined will not, in the short term, create new nesting
cavities in areas where they do not already occur. We rec-
ommend that forest planners use our threshold of 270
Ponderosa pine trees/ha to simulate habitat changes
across the landscape when planning treatments in areas
where Gambel oak are absent. We recommend that man-
agers retain all Gambel oak trees, when present, during
thinning operations. In areas of high Gambel oak densities
(>200 stems/ha), managers can maintain Ponderosa pine
densities up to 400 trees/ha and still maintain good-quality
bluebird habitat. We also recommend that treatments
increase the proportion of herbaceous ground cover and
bare soil to a combined total of at least 20%. After initial
treatment, maintenance and monitoring of the ground
cover, which may include frequent prescribed ﬁre applica-
tions, must be a priority if habitat conditions for bluebirds
are to be improved or sustained.
Implications for Practice
d Restoration treatments that increase the proportion
of grasses, forbs, and bare soil to a combined total of
greater than or equal to 20% should create good-
quality habitat for Western Bluebirds.
d Maintenance and monitoring of ground cover condi-
tions must be continued after initial treatment to
maintain good-quality bluebird habitat.
d The reduction of Ponderosa pine densities to less
than or equal to 270 stems/ha during treatments, if
Gambel oak are not present, is also important for
providing good-quality bluebird habitat.
d All Gambel oak trees, when present, should be re-
tained during thinning operations.
d If Gambel oak is present, Ponderosa pine trees can
be retained at slightly higher densities and still pro-
vide good-quality bluebird habitat.
d Tree densities should not be used for monitoring
Western Bluebird habitat quality without assessing
ground cover conditions because the invasion of
exotic herbaceous plants could alter the quality of
the habitat without affecting tree densities.
