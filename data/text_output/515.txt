The Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University is a pioneer in research-
ing, implementing, and monitoring ecological restoration of southwestern ponderosa pine 
forests. These forests have been significantly altered over the last century, with decreased 
ecological and recreational values, near-elimination of natural low-intensity fire regimes, 
and greatly increased risk of large-scale fires. The ERI is working with public agencies and 
other partners to restore these forests to a more ecologically healthy condition and trajectory—
in the process helping to significantly reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfire and its 
effects on human, animal, and plant communities.

and prescribed burning around inhabited areas is done both for com-
munity wildfire protection and to improve forest health. But with the 
benefits may come health concerns, visibility impairment, public safety 
issues, and diminished scenic and place value—the public nonetheless 
appears to understand and strongly support such work.

Executive summary
The restoration of forest ecosystems is an important, yet sometimes controversial, 
practice. In recent years numerous studies have explored how the public perceives for-
est health, restoration, and fire; however, few analyses have summarized and compared 
results across studies. The purpose of this publication is to identify consistencies in the 
results of recent studies, assess the public’s overall understanding of forest restoration 
issues, and evaluate areas of continuing controversy.
The information presented here is a synthesis of public survey research conducted 
throughout the country, with a primary focus on research conducted in the Southwest. 
We integrated a broad spectrum of literature in our evaluation, including peer-reviewed 
publications, gray literature, and unpublished studies. Each source was selected based 
on its focus and content area. We reached the following conclusions:
	
•	
Residents of the Southwest understand the ecological role of fire in south-	
	
	
	
western forests, but many are uncomfortable with allowing wildfires to burn.
	
•	
The use of prescribed fire (fire introduced by managers under specified 	
	
	
	
conditions to achieve management objectives) as a management tool is 	
	
	
	
strongly supported.
	
•	
Residents of the Southwest are concerned about the possible impacts of 	
	
	
	
smoke from prescribed fire and wildfire. However, most believe that smoke is
	
	
an acceptable side effect of using prescribed fire to manage the region’s forests.
	
•	
The use of mechanical thinning to reduce forest fuels and restore forest 	
	
	
	
structure is widely supported.
	
•	
Residents of the Southwest are solidly opposed to old-growth logging and do 	
	
	
not believe logging should drive the USDA Forest Service’s budget. How-
	
	
ever, they are not consistently opposed to the removal of some larger trees 	
	
	
	
during thinning operations.
	
•	
The Forest Service has earned a high level of public trust in its forest  
	
	
management, including the implementation of prescribed fire and mechanical 
	
	
thinning programs, in the Southwest.
	
•	
Government land managers and universities were chosen as top sources for  
	
	
public information regarding forest management.

Introduction
Understanding public values, perceptions, and preferences is increasingly recognized as 
a crucial element of public land management.1  Individuals who reside far from public 
forests, as well as those living nearby, expect to have their voices heard on a range of 
management issues, including restoration prescriptions and policies. Recent investi-
gations have concluded that “[Resource management] policies and practices lacking 
societal acceptance and approval will ultimately fail” even if scientifically valid and eco-
nomically feasible.2 Therefore, the success of forest restoration in the Southwest is tied 
to an understanding of public opinions, including sources of disagreement and conflict.
A number of studies have been conducted in recent years to assess public opinion on 
issues related to restoration and fire management, yet they have not been readily acces-
sible. This report synthesizes public opinion data on forest restoration-related issues in 
the Southwest (Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah) in order to identify areas 
of agreement and disagreement and to outline future research needs. It is intended to 
provide guidance to forest managers, policy makers, and researchers in planning future 
treatments and research.
How we constructed this analysis
The information presented in the tables that follow is based exclusively on studies con-
ducted in the Southwest. Additional results from studies focused on other geographic 
areas are included in the text in order to provide context for the information presented 
in the tables. To compare results across studies, we chose questions from different 
surveys that were fundamentally similar in terms of the questions asked and response 
categories given. The specific wordings of questions in the tables represent general 
summaries of the survey questions, and do not necessarily reflect the exact wordings as 
they originally appeared in the surveys.
In some cases, seemingly similar questions on different surveys resulted in dissimilar 
answers. There are several reasons why different surveys produce inconsistent respons-
es to similar questions. The surveys included here were not all sampled from the same 
populations; some surveyed residents of an entire state, others surveyed only part of a 
state, and others included samples from several different states. Each survey is based on 
a sample of people, and it can be expected that different samples, even from the same 
population, will show some variation. Furthermore, the surveys were administered 
during different years, and public opinions change over time, particularly in response 
to important events or personal experiences. Finally, differences in the way a question is 
asked and differences in what response categories are given can have a big effect on the 
answers respondents give. These sources of variation should be considered when inter-
preting the results presented here. Unless otherwise indicated, differences noted in the 
text are statistically significant. Interested readers should consult the original literature 
for more information on each study.

The role of fire in southwestern forests
Most people believe fire can, and does, play an important role in southwestern forest 
ecosystems.
Fire has been a natural and frequent occurrence in southwestern forests for millennia, 
but within the last century fire suppression has become a dominant forest management 
policy.3 After decades of hearing the “Smokey Bear” message that all forest fires are bad, 
Americans are starting to hear a more nuanced message: fires can be beneficial or detri-
mental depending on conditions. Two recent studies found high levels of understand-
ing for the natural role of fire in southwestern forests.4 Differences in the way survey 
questions were asked may account for the variation in results.
Several other surveys indicate that residents of the Southwest have a fairly complex 
view of fire and understand that recent catastrophic fires are, at least in part, a conse-
quence of decades of fire suppression. In one of the first studies of its kind, a 1981 sur-
vey showed that over two-thirds of Tucson, Arizona residents believed fires could have 
a beneficial effect on forests.5 In a more recent survey, 79 to 87 percent of residents of 
the Southwest believed that many plants require occasional fire for new seedlings to 
sprout.6 In 2003, 76 percent of residents of Arizona’s ponderosa pine belt believed the 
following statement was true: “We now have many damaging fires because fires were 
suppressed for many years.”7 A 2005 poll showed 78 percent of Arizonans agreeing with 
the statement, “Not all forest fires are bad.”8 
These findings show strong levels of understanding of the natural role of fire in south-
western forests and reflect a shift away from the belief that all forest fires are bad. This 
may help to explain the widespread support in the Southwest for the use of prescribed 
fire (fire introduced by managers under specified conditions to achieve management 
objectives). However, survey results presented elsewhere in this document suggest that 
people are not necessarily comfortable with allowing naturally ignited fires to burn 
freely.

EXTINGUISHING ALL WILDFIRES
There is disagreement over whether naturally ignited fires should ever be allowed to burn 
freely.
For decades, the U.S. Forest Service and many other land management agencies had a 
policy of extinguishing all fires. More recently, some National Forests, National Parks, 
and other public land units have allowed certain naturally ignited fires to burn as long 
as no lives or structures were threatened and the risk of the fire getting out of con-
trol was low. Two recent surveys examined whether or not residents of the Southwest 
support a policy of allowing wildfires (as opposed to prescribed burns) to burn if no 
human lives are at stake. In both cases a near-majority felt that all wildfires should be 
extinguished, even if no lives are threatened.9 
However, other surveys have indicated greater support for allowing naturally ignited 
fires to burn. In a study examining Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico residents’ 
opinions on fire management, between 20 and 26 percent of those surveyed believed 
“All fires must be extinguished regardless of cost,” while majorities in all three states 
agreed with the statement “We probably have to let some fires burn, but must protect 
residences.”10 Between six and 11 percent felt that fires should be allowed to burn 
naturally even if structures are at risk. A National Park study found that 33 percent of 
visitors to Grand Canyon National Park believed all fires should be prevented in Na-
tional Parks.11 In a 1981 survey of Tucson, Arizona residents, over 57 percent agreed 
with the statement, “Fires that are burning underbrush and debris, but not tall trees, 
should be allowed to burn as long as they’re watched.”12 
These findings show some support for allowing naturally ignited fires to burn. How-
ever, two of the most recent surveys found lower levels of acceptance, perhaps because 
both used the word “wildfire” whereas previous studies did not. These mixed results 
contrast with studies showing consistently high support for prescribed fire, as discussed 
below.

Prescribed fire
The majority of residents of the Southwest support using prescribed fire as a forest 
management tool to reduce wildfire risk and severity.
Research demonstrates that prescribed fire can be very effective in reducing forest fuel 
loadings and has ecological benefits in many southwestern forests.15 Therefore, pre-
scribed fire is a common management tool in the Southwest. Survey results indicate 
strong support for using prescribed fire, with the majority of survey participants believ-
ing it will reduce wildfire risk and severity.16 
Some surveys evaluated how personal characteristics or experiences influence percep-
tions regarding the issue of prescribed fire. Knowledge of prescribed fire’s effects, and 
trust in the implementing agency, have been found to be particularly important fac-
tors influencing people’s acceptance of its use.17 Results from a 2002 survey, while not 
tested for statistical significance, suggest that support for prescribed fire did not differ 
between those who lived in metropolitan areas (86 percent support among Maricopa 
County, Arizona residents; 88 percent support among Pima County, Arizona residents) 
and those who lived in more rural areas (86 percent support).18

SMOKE IMPACTS FROM PRESCRIBED FIRES
The majority of respondents feel that smoke produced by prescribed fires is acceptable.
All fires, whether naturally ignited or prescribed, produce smoke. Air quality impacts 
from fires can affect visibility, aesthetics, public safety, and human health.19 Two recent 
surveys found that residents of the Southwest generally believe that smoke from pre-
scribed fires is acceptable.20 
A recent study reported that 56 percent of the respondents in Yavapai County, Arizona, 
37 percent of respondents on Colorado’s Front Range, and 58 percent of respondents 
in the Salt Lake City and Tooele, Utah suburbs rated smoke from prescribed fires as a 
“great” or “moderate” concern.21 The remainder rated it as a “slight concern” or “not 
a concern.” In the aftermath of an escaped prescribed fire that reduced air quality in 
northern Utah, only 11 to 15 percent of affected residents agreed with the statement 
“Because of smoke, prescribed fire isn’t worth it.”22 A survey administered in 2002 
found that 82 to 83 percent of respondents in Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico 
believed the statement “People have difficulty breathing due to poor air quality after a 
fire” was true.23 Note that this question did not distinguish between prescribed fires 
and wildfires.
Residents of the Southwest are concerned about the possible impacts of smoke from 
prescribed fire and wildfire. However, most believe that smoke is an acceptable side ef-
fect of using prescribed fire to manage the region’s forests.

MECHANICAL THINNING
Residents of the Southwest support the use of mechanical thinning and believe it is 
effective in reducing the risk and intensity of wildfires.
Recent surveys have found strong public support for the use of mechanical thinning 
in reducing forest fuels and restoring forest structure, though levels of support appear 
to vary among different locations and contexts.24 In one recent study, Utah residents 
were less supportive of mechanical thinning, and less likely to believe in its effective-
ness, than Colorado or Arizona residents.25 Another survey reported differences in both 
acceptance of thinning and beliefs in its effectiveness between wildland-urban interface 
and non-wildland-urban interface residents.26 It also concluded that very few respon-
dents were concerned with the effects of mechanical thinning on soil erosion or water 
quality, soil compaction, ecosystem damage, recreational opportunities, scenic beauty, 
wildlife habitat, and native plant growth. A 2001 survey recorded positive attitudes 
toward, and approval of, mechanical thinning among both permanent and seasonal 
residents of western Colorado, with no significant differences between homeowner 
types.27 A 1998 survey found positive attitudes toward mechanical thinning as a means 
of performing restoration in the Mt. Logan Wilderness Area in northern Arizona.28 
Taken together, these studies show that the use of mechanical thinning as a manage-
ment tool has widespread support among residents of the Southwest.

REMOVING LARGE-DIAMETER TREES
Residents of the Southwest want old-growth forests protected but do not consistently agree 
whether it is acceptable to remove “large-diameter” trees.
Removing large-diameter trees during thinning operations has become a controversial 
issue for forest managers around the country. Restoration treatments, as well as fuel 
reduction operations, often include the removal of trees in a range of size classes. There 
is no universally accepted definition of “large-diameter,” and disagreement exists as to 
whether large trees should ever be removed during thinning treatments. A related issue 
concerns the removal of old-growth trees, which are usually not only large in size, but 
also centuries old.
Public opinion regarding the removal of large-diameter trees was evaluated in four 
recent surveys.29 One study documented majority support for focusing on thinning 
smaller brush and trees rather than on cutting large trees. In the three other surveys, 
more respondents supported large tree removal than opposed it. These varying results 
are likely due to differences in the way each survey asked this question. For example, 
only one of the four studies actually defined “large-diameter tree” (in this case, a tree 
over 16 inches in diameter).30 
In a 2002 survey, 76 percent of Arizonans felt that it was important to save old-growth 
southwestern forests.31 Another Arizona survey found that 79 percent believed the 
Forest Service’s budget should not depend on how much commercial timber is pro-
duced.32 
These results suggest that people may accept thinning of large trees, depending on the 
context and how “large tree” is defined. Residents of the Southwest are solidly opposed 
to old-growth logging and do not believe logging should drive the Forest Service’s bud-
get, but are not consistently opposed to the removal of some larger trees during thin-
ning operations.

TRUST IN THE FOREST SERVICE
There are high levels of public trust in the Forest Service to manage southwestern forests 
responsibly.
Public trust in land management agencies has been recognized as an important fac-
tor influencing the acceptability of management actions.33 Two recent Arizona surveys 
found high levels of public trust in the Forest Service’s overall forest management and 
in the implementation of its prescribed fire and mechanical thinning programs.34 
Other surveys have addressed similar topics. One recent study measured public trust in 
the Forest Service along an eight-point scale (1 = “You do not trust the Forest Service 
at all”; 8 = “You trust the Forest Service completely”).35 Average scores for respondents 
from Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico were 6.3, 6.1, and 5.8, respectively. These 
values indicate a relatively high level of trust for the Forest Service. High levels of pub-
lic trust in the Southwest contrast with levels of trust elsewhere in the country. A 2000 
survey of northeast Oregon residents found only 43 percent trusted the Forest Service 
with a prescribed fire program and 52 percent with a mechanical thinning program.36 
A recent study focusing on California, Michigan, and Florida found support for the no-
tion that public trust in government land managers is associated with perceived agency 
competence as well as with perceived risks and benefits of proposed actions.37 Despite 
the range of controversial issues confronting the Forest Service, residents of the South-
west report high levels of trust in the agency’s management of forestlands, and specifi-
cally in its implementation of prescribed fire and thinning programs.

SOURCES FOR PUBLIC INFORMATION
Government land managers and universities were selected as the most credible sources for 
public information on forest health issues.
Learning about forest health issues from a credible, accurate, and unbiased source is 
important. The public obtains information through a variety of avenues, each with its 
own objectives and perspectives. Results from the 2003 and 2005 Grand Canyon State 
Surveys show that the majority of respondents believe government land managers and 
universities provide the most credible information on forest management.38 Note that 
respondents were asked to choose only one source as the most persuasive (in 2003) or 
most accurate (in 2005).
A recent study examined trust in information sources in the Pacific Northwest.39 It 
found that 84 percent of survey respondents rated university researchers as “trustwor-
thy,” while newspapers and magazines, TV and radio programs, and environmental 
groups were considered trustworthy by 53, 49, and 25 percent, respectively. Other 
surveys evaluated where the public prefers to get its information on forestry issues. 
Survey participants in Arizona ranked newspapers (33 percent) and the Forest Service 
(28 percent) as the most preferred information sources, while only 14 percent selected 
television and nine percent radio.40 Magazines, the Internet, and nonprofit organiza-
tions were rarely selected in this survey, with fewer than six percent of respondents 
selecting each of these options.

CONCLUSIONS
The results synthesized in this publication point to areas of agreement and disagree-
ment in the public debate over forest restoration. The Forest Service, which manages 
most of the forestland in the Southwest, has earned a high level of public trust in its 
management of the National Forests. Mechanical thinning and prescribed fire, two 
major tools in fuel reduction and forest restoration, are also widely supported by the 
public, and the smoke effects from prescribed fire are seen as an acceptable conse-
quence of using this management approach. The public has a fairly advanced under-
standing of the natural role of fire in southwestern forests, with most residents believ-
ing fire can have beneficial effects on forest ecosystems.
At the same time, clarity and agreement are lacking regarding some elements of public 
debate. Surveys point to varying results regarding the acceptability of allowing naturally 
ignited fires to burn freely. Some studies show majority support for this practice, while 
others do not. Equally inconclusive are the data on the acceptability of removing large-
diameter trees, with some studies pointing to broad opposition and others showing 
majority support for some removal of large trees. It is likely that public sentiment on 
both of these topics depends greatly on specific situations. Answers to questions such 
as “Where will fire be allowed to burn?,” “What resources might be at risk?,” “How is a 
large-diameter tree defined and how many will be removed?,” and “What is the justifi-
cation for removing these larger trees?” will no doubt influence public opinion. More 
research is needed to investigate the nuances of these important issues. Future research 
is also needed to examine the relationships between demographic variables (for exam-
ple, age, income, ethnicity, and education) and opinions on forest restoration, particu-
larly at a time when the population of the Southwest is rapidly changing.
