Bringing Forest Restoration to a New Elevation
Partners
The Lower Middle Mountain Research Project is a 
collaborative forest restoration project involving the 
San Juan National Forest, Northern Arizona 
University (Flagstaff, AZ), and Fort Lewis College 
(Durango, CO).
Need for New Knowledge
Warm, dry mixed conifer forests in 
southwestern Colorado, like many forests in 
the region, are experiencing diminished 
ecosystem function, increased susceptibility 
to crown fires, and insect outbreaks. 
There is a general consensus that action is 
needed in these forests to restore ecosystem 
health and decrease the danger of harmful 
crown fires. However, there is currently a  lack 
of information about effective restoration 
options in this forest type.
Knowledge gained from this replicated forest 
management experiment will provide scientific 
information ecological effects of different 
restoration treatments.
This information can be directly applied by 
land managers on area national forests and 
other forests in the region.
The initial planning meeting with faculty, staff, and students 
from Fort Lewis College, Northern Arizona University, and 
Colorado State University, and staff from the Pagosa Springs 
Ranger District of the San Juan National Forest.  
Examples of the warm, dry mixed conifer forest in the study 
area.  Top photograph shows mature ponderosa pine (Pinus 
ponderosa) forest with a thick undergrowth of Douglas-fir 
(Pseudotsuga menziesii), white fir (Pinus concolor), quaking 
aspen (Populus tremuloides), and various shrubs.  The bottom 
photograph shows a forest more dominated by aspens in the 
foreground.
