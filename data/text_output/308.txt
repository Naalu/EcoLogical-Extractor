Abstract: The ecological benefits of changing cattle grazing practices in the western United States remain
controversial, due in part to a lack of experimentation. In 1997 we initiated an experimental study of two
rangeland alternatives, cattle removal and high-impact grazing, and compared grassland community responses
with those with more conventional, moderate grazing practices. The study was conducted in a high-elevation,
semiarid grassland near Flagstaff, Arizona (U.S.A.). We conducted annual plant surveys of modified Whittaker
plots for 8 years and examined plant composition shifts among treatments and years. High-impact grazing
had strong directional effects that led to a decline in perennial forb cover and an increase in annual plants,
particularly the exotic cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.). A twofold increase in plant cover by exotic species
followed a severe drought in the sixth year of the study, and this increase was greatest in the high-impact
grazing plots, where native cover declined by one-half. Cattle removal resulted in little increase in native
plant cover and reduced plant species richness relative to the moderate grazing control. Our results suggest
that some intermediate level of cattle grazing may maintain greater levels of native plant diversity than the
alternatives of cattle removal or high-density, short-duration grazing practices. Furthermore, episodic drought
interacts with cattle grazing, leading to infrequent, but biologically important shifts in plant communities. Our
results demonstrate the importance of climatic variation in determining ecological effects of grazing practices,
and we recommend improving conservation efforts in arid rangelands by developing management plans that
anticipate this variation.

Impacto de la Intensidad de Pastoreo durante la Sequ´ıa en un Pastizal de Arizona
Resumen: Los beneficios ecol´ogicos del cambio de pr´acticas de pastoreo de ganado en el oeste de Estados
Unidos aun son controversiales, en parte por la falta de experimentaci´on. En 1997 iniciamos un estudio
experimental de dos alternativas, remoci´on de ganado y pastoreo de alto impacto, y comparamos las respuestas
de la comunidad de pastizal con las de pr´acticas de pastoreo moderadas, m´as convencionales. El estudio se
llev´o a cabo en un pastizal semi´arido, de alta elevaci´on, cerca de Flagstaff, Arizona (E.U.A.). Durante 8 a˜nos
realizamos muestreos anuales de plantas en parcelas Whittaker modificadas y examinamos los cambios en la
composici´on de plantas entre tratamientos y a˜nos. El pastoreo de alto impacto tuvo dos efectos direccionales
que llevaron a una declinaci´on en la cobertura de hierbas perennes y al incremento de plantas anuales,
particularmente de pasto ex´otico Bromus tectorum L. Despu´es de una sequ´ıa severa la cobertura de especies
ex´oticas increment´o al doble en el sexto a˜no del estudio, y este incremento fue mayor en las parcelas de pastoreo
de alto impacto, en las que la cobertura de especies nativas declin´o a la mitad. La remoci´on de ganado result´o
en un leve incremento en la cobertura de plantas nativas y redujo la riqueza de especies de plantas en relaci´on
con el control con pastoreo moderado. Nuestros resultados sugieren que alg´un nivel intermedio de pastoreo
puede mantener mayores niveles de diversidad de plantas nativas que las alternativas de remoci´on de ganado

Introduction
Scientific information on the effects of livestock grazing
is plentiful and can be construed to support the claims
of very different positions on the subject (e.g., Fleischner
1994; Brown & McDonald 1995). To improve the science
of rangeland conservation, we argue for greater atten-
tion to the variability among ecosystems and experimen-
tation with alternative grazing practices. Differences in
site productivity and plant tolerance to grazing are great,
even among similar grassland biomes (Mack & Thomp-
son 1982), and responses to grazing vary with climatic
conditions (Curtin 2002). Consequently, the evaluation
of the effects of livestock on critical components of bio-
logical diversity and rangeland productivity may require
regional- or site-specific research that incorporates cli-
matic variability. Moreover, published research is based
largely on observational studies that singularly address cat-
tle removal as an alternative to current practices (Curtin
2002). Experimentation with management-relevant treat-
ments provides an opportunity to establish predictable
relationships among a variety of grazing practices and
ecological responses, thus expanding conservation-based
management beyond a single strategy.
Numerous alternatives to current grazing practices ex-
ist, including removing or reducing cattle (Bock et al.
1993), development of exurban housing (Maestas et al.
2003), and increasing the density of cattle (Savory & Par-
sons 1980). Fleischner (1994) highlights the negative ef-
fects of cattle and posits that their removal would ben-
efit ecosystems at multiple trophic levels. Nevertheless,
the ecological literature from the western United States
provides contradictory evidence on the effects of remov-
ing livestock, particularly for plant communities (Brown
& McDonald 1995; Curtin 2002). Stohlgren et al. (1999)
compared grazed pastures with livestock exclosures in
four western states and found no consistent effect of graz-
ing on species diversity. Jones (2000) reviewed 150 stud-
ies of grazing in arid regions and found that the majority
of research provides limited inference due to poor exper-
imental design. Of the studies deemed sufficiently robust,
vegetation responses were too varied to support a defini-
tive conclusion on the effects of livestock removal ( Jones
2000). In this journal Curtin (2002) reviewed recent graz-
ing studies (Milchunas & Lauenroth 1993; Stohlgren et
al. 1999; Jones 2000) and concluded that (1) because
grassland ecosystems are sustained through dynamic pro-
cesses of disturbance, research should broaden beyond
exclosure-only studies; (2) climatic patterns, particularly
in arid regions, often interact with management actions,
necessitating the integration of treatment and climate ef-
fects in research; and (3) research should aim to identify
environmental thresholds at which management actions
have predictable effects.
Consistent with Curtin’s (2002) recommendations to
assess the conservation implications of alternative grazing
practices, we examined a gradient of grazing intensities
applied in an 8-year controlled experiment over a period
of marked climatic variation. In a high-elevation semiarid
grassland, we addressed the following questions: (1) What
are the relative effects of alternative grazing practices and
interannual climatic variation on the organization of grass-
land communities? (2) How do plant functional groups
respond to cattle removal in contrast to increasing cattle
density? and (3) What are the conservation implications
of shifts in plant composition in a region where inter-
annual climatic variation is great? We interpreted our re-
sults in the context of the published literature and make
recommendations regarding the conservation of semiarid
rangelands.
Methods
Study Area
The study site is located in a high-elevation, semiarid grass-
land in north-central Arizona (U.S.A., 34◦59′ 03′N 111◦
26′ 30′W) at an elevation of 2160 m, within the upper
Great Basin grassland (Brown 1994) at an ecotone that
includes ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Law-
son) and one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma [En-
gelm.] Sarg.). The herbaceous plant community is domi-
nated by the perennial grasses western wheatgrass (Pas-
copyrum smithii [Rydb.] A. L¨ove) and squirreltail grass
(Elymus elymoides [Raf.] Swezeyi) and the forb Carruth’s
sagewort (Artemisia carruthii Wood ex Carruth.). The
soils are Mollisols dominated by shrink-swell clays with

basalt cobbles throughout. The variation of sand, silt, and
clay textural classes was generally within a range of 10%
among study plots (Loeser et al. 2001b). A full description
of the study area and experimental design is in Loeser et
al. (2001a).
The region has a biannual precipitation regime with
winter snowfalls and summer rains. The area’s 20-year
mean for precipitation during the water year (8 months
prior to July and our annual plant survey) is 384 mm.
Water-year precipitation for this region during the years
of this study, 1997–2004, was approximately one-half of
the 20-year mean (Table 1). July is the warmest month
of the year with a mean monthly maximum temperature
of 27◦C, and January is the coldest month with a mean
minimum temperature of −9◦C.
The history of livestock grazing for this site was dif-
ficult to document; however, available records indicate
that low- to moderate-intensity livestock grazing has oc-
curred on the site for the latter half of the twentieth
century. Historical records suggest overgrazing occurred
over much of Arizona between 1870 and 1890 (Hastings
& Turner 1965; Curtin et al. 2002), and we expect this
particular study site was no exception. Cattle and sheep
grazing during 1900–1950 was variable, with generally
greater stocking rates than in recent decades. In addition
to livestock, large grazers, including elk (Cervus elaphus),
mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and pronghorn (An-
tilocapra americana), inhabit this region and were not
intentionally excluded from any treatment. Fecal counts
suggest no difference in wild ungulate usage of experi-
mental plots (Loeser et al. 2005).
Experimental Design
To document the relationships between grazing and the
plant community, we implemented two alternative treat-
ments in an area with preexisting grazing by cattle. We
first selected a 320-ha pasture that received livestock
grazing of moderate intensity (1 cow-calf pair/ha for 20
days/year in a rest-rotation cycle) in which ranchers man-
aged livestock to remove no more than 50% of above-
ground plant biomass. The herd primarily comprised
cow-calf pairs of a hybrid breed (Gelbvieh and Angus)
that were habituated to the rest-rotation practice and the
vegetation type. We built three 1-ha livestock exclosures
adjacent to 1-ha livestock enclosures (three pairs). Adja-
cent to each fenced pair of plots, we demarcated a sur-
vey plot in the surrounding moderately grazed pasture
(Fig. 1).
In this manner the study site consisted of three
blocks located in areas dominated by grassland vege-
tation with sparsely distributed trees. Each block con-
tained three treatments (cattle removal, moderate graz-
ing, high-impact grazing). The cattle removal and high-
impact treatments were initiated in 1997. The moderate
grazing practice was the experimental control because
it was most similar to predominant land-use practices in
the American southwest and was the initial condition of
the novel treatments. The livestock enclosures received a
high-impact, short-duration grazing treatment to simulate
herd impact without killing plant root systems (average
grazing event of 200 cow-calf pairs/hectare/year for ap-
proximately 12 hours). This treatment occurred annually
except for 2002, when drought conditions forced ranch-
ers to relocate their cattle. This treatment served as a criti-
cal upper-end treatment representing a ranching practice
that could be implemented with open-range herding or
similar concentrated techniques.

Plant Surveys
To measure plant community composition we established
a permanent modified Whittaker plot (Stohlgren et al.
1995) in the center of each 1-ha treatment area for a total
of nine survey plots. The modified Whittaker plot allows
for determination of the heterogeneity of plant commu-
nities with a greater degree of accuracy than either true
random sampling or the original Whittaker plot design
(Stohlgren et al. 1995). This sampling design involved a
1000-m2 plot with nested subplots consisting of 1 100-m2,
2 10-m2, and 10 1-m2 subplots (Stohlgren et al. 1995).
Species lists for the 1-, 10-, 100-, and 1000-m2 subplots
were completed to measure species richness; however,
we only report data from 1-m2 subplots here. Plant iden-
tifications were referenced with the Deaver Herbarium
(Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff), and voucher
specimens were retained in the Sisk Laboratory (North-
ern Arizona University in Flagstaff). Of the approximately
80 plant species at the site, 5 could not be identified due
to the poor condition of the specimens and were removed
from all analyses. In all cases unidentified specimens were
rare and accounted for <0.05% of ground cover.
The first year of survey data was collected prior to im-
plementation of the cattle removal or high-impact treat-
ments and reflects the pretreatment condition of moder-
ate grazing practices. Each modified Whittaker plot was
surveyed annually in July, except in 1997 when measure-
ments were made in September. Plant surveys occurred
prior to the primary grazing event by cattle; however,
brief periods of cattle grazing early in the season preceded
plant surveys in 1997 and 1998.
Community-Level Analyses
To address our initial question of plant community re-
sponses to treatments and year effects, we created a two-
dimensional ordination of the plots’ plant communities
in species space with nonmetric multidimensional scal-
ing (NMS; McCune & Grace 2002) for the pretreatment
year of 1997 and the last year of the study, 2004. Data
matrices were composed of sample units (each modi-
fied Whittaker plot) and species (number of occurrences
among the ten 1-m2 subplots). A Sorenson distance mea-
sure was applied because of its good performance with
ecological data (McCune & Grace 2002). For each treat-
ment the average position in ordination space of the three
plots was calculated and plotted with error bars that rep-
resent standard deviation. Finally, we tested the effect
size of treatment on community composition in each year
with a nonmetric multiresponse permutation procedure
(MRPP) and report the chance-corrected within-group
agreement value (A) and a p value (McCune & Grace
2002). To further describe results from the ordination,
we calculated the average cover of each plant species in
1997, the pretreatment condition, and in 2004, the last
year of data collection.
To elucidate the patterns observed in the ordination,
we calculated native and exotic species richness. The
average species richness was calculated for each modi-
fied Whittaker plot based on the ten 1-m2 subplots. We
used a hierarchical approach to the statistical analysis
of these data. The first step was a test of treatment-by-
year interactions with a repeated measures analysis of
variance (RM-ANOVA). If the result was significant ( p <
0.05), we conducted a post hoc analysis for treatment
effects within each year with Tukey’s HSD (honest sig-
nificant difference, Sokal & Rohlf 1995). Nevertheless, if
the treatment-by-year interaction was not significant, we
report RM-ANOVA results for the whole model. A blocked
design was applied to increase our ability to detect treat-
ment effects; however, the placement of the three blocks
in a single pasture (320 ha) constitutes a form of pseudo
replication that we were unable to avoid due to logistics
involved in moving cattle.
To investigate the potential effects of grazing intensity
on the spread of exotic species of greatest concern at
this site, we compared the occurrence of cheatgrass (Bro-
mus tectorum L.) among treatments, as measured by fre-
quency. We define occurrence as a measure of the spatial
distribution of cheatgrass and calculated occurrence as
the percentage of the thirty 1-m2 subplots of each treat-
ment in which cheatgrass was present. We calculated the
average occurrence of cheatgrass for each treatment by
year and analyzed these data as described previously.
We examined canopy cover of plant functional groups
(annual forbs, perennial forbs, annual grasses, and peren-
nial grasses) and exotic and native species. Cover was
calculated in each modified Whittaker plot as the average
among the 10 1-m2 subplots. The 1-m2 subplots were sur-
veyed with a pin frame (Mueller-Dombois & Ellenberg
1974). We placed a pin (diameter = 0.5 cm) through
the frame at 50 grid intersections for each 1-m2 subplot
and recorded all basal and foliar contacts with the pin.
Canopy cover for each species was estimated as the num-
ber of contacts with the pin divided by 50. The pin frame
method is robust to multiple observers and performs well
in low-growing vegetation (Kent & Coker 1992). Statisti-
cal analysis followed methods discussed previously. Pre-
sentation of the plant functional group data followed the
convention of displaying differences between alternative
treatments and the moderate grazing control in each year.

than cattle removal. Community dissimilarity between
high-impact plots and moderate grazing plots was nearly
twofold greater than between cattle removal and mod-
erately grazed plots ( p = 0.02, A = 0.25; Fig. 2b). Fur-
thermore, high-impact grazing exerted the greatest ho-
mogenizing effect on the plant community; the average
community dissimilarity was less than one-half of either
cattle removal or moderate grazing plots. A more detailed
description of the plant community based on canopy
cover of individual species suggests that no single species
is solely responsible for the community differences ob-
served ( ). Pretreatment data collected in 1997 verified
that plant communities were initially similar ( p = 0.75,
A = −0.05; Fig. 2a).
Grazing Effects on Native and Exotic Plant Species Richness
Species richness of plants was affected by novel grazing
treatments and interannual climatic variation. In 4 of the 7
years following initiation of the treatments, cattle removal
reduced native species richness by 1 species/m2 com-
pared with the moderate grazing control (Tukey pairwise:
p < 0.05; Fig. 3a). High-impact grazing yielded a similar
trend, but it rarely differed statistically from the moderate
grazing control. Treatment effects on native plant species
richness were strongly influenced by interannual varia-
tion (F14,158 = 2.40, p < 0.01). By the final year of the
study novel treatments had relatively weak effects on na-
tive species richness, which suggests that differences in
native species richness were not driving the divergence
of plant communities observed in the ordination of 2004
plots (Fig. 2b).
Differences in exotic plant species richness among
treatments were an important factor in community
change. Exotic species richness showed an increasing
trend over time in both high-impact grazing and cattle
removal treatments (F14,158 = 8.48, p < 0.01; Fig. 3b).
year of the study we observed, on average, one more ex-
otic species per square meter in cattle removal plots than
the moderate grazing control and twice that amount in the
high-impact grazing plots (Tukey pairwise: p < 0.05). The
effect of novel treatments on exotic species was periodi-
cally overwhelmed by environmental conditions, such as
during the severe early season drought of 2002, in which
exotic species were nearly absent from the plots (Ta-
ble 3).
Grazing Effects on Cheatgrass
Cheatgrass in particular responded strongly to the high-
impact grazing treatment and to a lesser degree to the cat-
tle removal treatment. Cheatgrass, an exotic annual grass,
initially occurred in <5% of our survey plots and showed
sporadic increases until it became almost completely ab-
sent during the 2002 drought (F14,158 = 9.72, p < 0.01;
Fig. 4). In 2003 cheatgrass became dominant in the high-
impact treatment, occurring on 80% of the 1-m2 subplots,
compared with <50% of plots in other treatments (Tukey
pairwise: p < 0.05; Fig. 4). The difference in the spatial
extent of cheatgrass between high-impact and other treat-
ments widened in 2004: cheatgrass colonized nearly 100%
of the 1-m2 survey plots in the high-impact treatment. Fur-
thermore, counts of basal and foliar cover of cheatgrass
were at least two times greater in the high-impact treat-
ment than other treatments in 2004 (M.R.R.L., data not
provided).
Grazing Effects on Plant Cover
Plant cover showed greater variability in response to
novel treatments than plant species richness; however,
clear trends emerged. First, the effect of grazing treat-
ments on plant cover depended on environmental con-
ditions that fluctuate over time, such as precipitation.
Treatment-by-time interactions were statistically signif-
icant for all plant functional groups (perennial forb:
F14,158 = 6.18, p < 0.01; perennial grass: F14,158 = 3.16,
p < 0.01; annual forb: F14,148 = 3.51, p < 0.01; annual
grass: F14,158 = 5.29, p < 0.01; Fig. 5). Second, high-
impact grazing generally showed greater effects on plant
cover than did cattle removal. Perennial forb cover con-
sistently declined in response to high-impact grazing in
the latter half of the study and was 8% lower than in the
moderate grazing control by the last year of the study
(Tukey pairwise: p < 0.05; Fig. 5a). In high-impact grazing
sites annual grass cover increased (Fig. 5d) but perennial

influenced by interannual variation (treatment-by-year in-
teractions: native, F14,158 = 5.70, p < 0.01; exotic, F14,158
= 5.92, p < 0.01; Table 3). High-impact grazing had lit-
tle effect on native plant cover until the sixth year of the
study, when cover declined by nearly one-half in a single
year, apparently due to an interaction with drought early
in the year (Tukey pairwise: p < 0.05). Two years after
the sharp decline, native plant cover remained 10% lower
in high-impact grazing plots than either moderate grazing
or cattle removal plots.
Exotic plant cover showed the opposite response and
was 13% greater in high-impact plots than the moderate
grazing control in the final year of the study. Exotic cover
was also greater in cattle removal plots than control plots.
At the end of the study, however, it was difficult to iso-
late the effect of cattle removal because relatively large
amounts of exotic plant cover were present in some cat-
tle removal plots at the beginning of the study (Table 3).

Discussion
The plant communities under alternative grazing treat-
ments diverged, and the magnitude of the effect was influ-
enced by climatic conditions. High-impact grazing in com-
bination with a severe drought led native plant cover in
the subsequent year to decline by one-half. Furthermore,
we observed a sharp increase in the occurrence of annual
plants, particularly cheatgrass, in the high-impact grazing
treatment. By the seventh year of the study, the novel treat-
ments of high-impact grazing and cattle removal showed
greater exotic plant species richness and cover than the
moderate grazing control. In general, plant cover exhib-
ited much greater variability in response to novel grazing
treatments than overall community composition, and na-
tive plant cover was relatively insensitive to the removal
of cattle. In the context of an ecosystem with a century
of livestock grazing, our experimental assessment of eco-
logical effects of alternative management practices doc-
uments complex responses in the plant community that
present challenges to management.

Climate and Grazing Interactions
The effects of alternative grazing practices were greatly in-
fluenced by interannual variation in climatic conditions,
particularly precipitation. Our study spanned 8 years dur-
ing which the coefficient of variation in annual precipita-
tion was 39%, and each year’s precipitation fell below the
20-year mean. Drought was particularly severe at the start

of the growing season in 2002, when northern Arizona
received only 19% of its average precipitation (20-year
mean). The drought corresponded with a 10% decline
in total canopy cover for cattle removal and moderate
grazing treatments and >30% decline in the high-impact
treatment.
A similar interaction of drought and heavy grazing
was documented by Fuhlendorf and Smeins (1997) for
the plant composition of a semiarid savanna in Texas.
The plant community exposed to heavy grazing showed
twofold greater change than either light grazing or cat-
tle removal treatments (Fuhlendorf & Smeins 1997). The
loss of cover measured in our study is more remarkable
in light of the fact that it occurred in a year when cattle
were completely absent. The drought conditions of 2002
forced ranchers to relocate their cattle, and therefore the
plant response we documented provides evidence that
past grazing practices can greatly influence community
responses to local climatic change. In this case 5 years of
high-impact grazing prior to 2002 interacted with drought
to reduce plant cover dramatically.
Although canopy cover fully rebounded to predrought
levels in 2003, more than one-third of this increase
was attributable to exotic species. Exotic species appar-
ently benefited from the reduced capacity of native plant
species, and if the plant composition of this grassland op-
erates in a nonequilibrium fashion (Westoby et al. 1989),
the dramatic increase in exotic species may signify a tran-
sition to a new community state. In contrast, if this re-
sponse is transitory, high-impact grazing practices still
may present a risk to native plants because the likelihood
of a future drought remains high in a region where at
least eight severe, multiyear droughts have occurred in
the last 1000 years (Ni et al. 2002). Predictions of future
responses of the plant community to continued human
perturbation, such as grazing, in the face of certain cli-
matic variability remain fraught with challenges charac-
teristic of complex natural systems (Brown et al. 1997).
Exotic Species Responses to Grazing
Exotic cover in the last 2 years of the study was primarily
composed of two annual weeds, tumblemustard (Sisym-
brium altissimum L.) and cheatgrass, common distur-
bance loving species in western U.S. rangelands (Young
et al. 1972; Gelbard & Belnap 2003). S. altissimum ac-
counted for 13% of plant cover in 2003, which was nearly
one-half of the total exotic species cover, but it declined
to 1% of total plant cover in 2004. S. altissimum exhibited
highly variable germination, which appears to be associ-
ated with wet conditions and disturbance. Cattle grazing
increases S. altissimum abundance (Pearson 1976); how-
ever, its ability to remain a dominant species in succes-
sional communities appears limited (Daubenmire 1940).
Similarly, cheatgrass shows great interannual variabil-
ity (Hull & Pechanec 1947), but a growing body of lit-
erature suggests it can alter community type and dis-
place native biota (Young & Evans 1978; Belnap & Phillips
2001), which increases persistence of cheatgrass. Grazing
is generally considered a dispersal vector for cheatgrass;
however, populations can establish in locations that are
not grazed by livestock (Belnap & Phillips 2001). Fur-
thermore, carefully controlled grazing may reduce cheat-
grass abundance (Daubenmire 1940; Mosley 1996). In our
study region cheatgrass is broadly distributed, but seldom
dominant (L. Moser, personal communication). In north-
ern Arizona cheatgrass populations appear to be expand-
ing in distribution along roadways (e.g., Gelbard & Belnap
2003), but it is difficult to predict the likelihood of persis-
tence. A cheatgrass population that increased to 70% of
plant cover following a wildfire in sagebrush was subse-
quently reduced by 65% during a period of drought (West

& Yorks 2002). Our data clearly link high-impact grazing
to increased spread of cheatgrass; however, the relation-
ship between grazing and cheatgrass distribution is not
necessarily linear. Our results suggest that intermediate
levels of grazing may inhibit cheatgrass colonization, but
this finding should be experimentally tested over a longer
time period. If cheatgrass ultimately becomes a dominant
species in this plant community, it would likely increase
the frequency of fire, resulting in further impacts to the
native biota (Young & Evans 1978).
Grazing-Tolerant Traits in the Plant Community
Surprisingly, cattle removal and high-impact grazing treat-
ments, which were designed to represent opposing ends
of a grazing intensity gradient, produced similar ecolog-
ical outcomes. Both treatments reduced native species
richness and increased exotic species richness in com-
parison with the moderate-intensity treatment. It may be
that an intermediate level of disturbance from livestock
grazing can promote a more heterogeneous landscape,
providing greater opportunity for a variety of plants (Mc-
Naughton 1983). In a review of grazing effects on vege-
tation heterogeneity, Adler et al. (2001) found that patch-
scale grazing typically increased plant diversity. Apply-
ing this framework to our study, the density of cattle in
the moderate grazing treatment may have encouraged
patch-scale grazing. In contrast, the high-impact treat-
ment could be considered a homogenizing force acting on
the plant community as dense cattle herds place grazers
on all possible vegetative patches, equalizing ecological
impacts.
Homogenization of the community may also occur at
the opposite end of our gradient of grazing pressure be-
cause the removal of cattle eliminates a major agent of
patch-scale disturbances. Further observation of cattle be-
havior at this site may provide evidence by which we
may evaluate the patch-scale disturbance hypothesis. We
emphasize that moderate grazing practices may sustain
greater native plant diversity now, but it remains to be
determined whether livestock grazing had this effect on
native plant diversity during their initial introduction to
this region. Undocumented changes in the populations
of native grazers at the time of livestock introduction fur-
ther complicate efforts to understand changes in plant
communities during the past century.
An evolutionary perspective, which encompasses
much longer time periods, may serve as an important in-
dicator of plant community responses to grazing intensity
(Milchunas & Lauenroth 1993). Rangelands in the Ameri-
can Southwest do not show evidence of large herds of na-
tive mammalian grazers equivalent to typical disturbance-
adapted communities in the midwestern United States
or the African Serengeti; however, its grasslands include
many disturbance-tolerant species. The dominance of
short-statured plants, with perennating organs located
close to the ground and storage organs located below-
ground, confers resilience to both drought and grazing
(Coughenour 1985; Sala et al. 1996) on this grassland.
Other traits, such as fiber content (Adler et al. 2004), ni-
trogen content (Adler et al. 2004), and ability to colonize
gaps (Bullock et al. 2001), may make the system tolerant
of grazing, but generalizations have been criticized (Vesk
& Westoby 2001).
Within the last few centuries various events in the
western United States have encouraged the spread of
grazing-tolerant species. Agricultural policies have pro-
moted “range improvement” programs that involve the
seeding of grazing-tolerant species, often introducing
new species (Rogler & Lorenz 1983). Moreover, exten-
sive and intensive livestock grazing can exert directional
selection pressures that favor grazing-tolerant plants over
less tolerant species (Fuhlendorf et al. 2001). At our study
site the grazing-tolerant bunchgrass, E. elymoides, has ex-
panded its range within the last century and currently oc-
curs as a dominant species across large areas (M.R.R.L.,
unpublished data). We hypothesize that a century of live-
stock grazing, and in particular a multidecadal period of
intensive grazing in the late 1800s, increased the rela-
tive composition of grazing-tolerant species (Loeser et al.
2004). Incomplete records from our site also suggest that
community composition has been more stable during the
last half of the twentieth century, leading up to the current
period of rapid spread of exotic species, which our data
suggest is being facilitated by recurrent drought. In grass-
lands where grazing-induced shifts in dominant species
have occurred, the value of a site’s evolutionary history
in predicting plant responses is greatly reduced.
Conclusions and Management Implications
In regions that are typified by large interannual varia-
tion in climate, interactions between grazing and climate
should be anticipated by researchers and managers, even
if the effects are poorly understood (Wiegand & Milton
1996; Fuhlendorf et al. 2001). In the northern Arizona
rangeland, areas that have a high density of ungulates,
such as corrals, watering holes, and trails, are most sus-
ceptible to exotic species expansion following severe
drought, which acts as a stressor on native species. Local
knowledge of management areas should be used to iden-
tify heavily grazed areas to assist managers in the control
of exotic species, such as cheatgrass. Furthermore, as the
variability in precipitation events is expected to increase
as a component of climate change (Frich et al. 2002),
managers should anticipate more drought-years that fur-
ther stress native communities and facilitate the spread
of cheatgrass and other exotic plant species. Although

cost-effective control of most exotic species does not ap-
pear close at hand, preventative steps are warranted. Care-
ful scrutiny of soil disturbance events, such as intense
grazing practices and road building, should precede ac-
tion.
It is a common practice in the American Southwest to
remove cattle from grasslands for 1–3 years to provide
an opportunity for recovery of degraded plant communi-
ties. Our results cast doubt on the efficacy of short-term
removal of cattle to increase local-scale plant diversity
(Floyd et al. 2003). In fact, native species richness in the
moderately grazed treatment was greater or similar to that
in cattle removal plots, even in very dry years. Long-term
removal of cattle, perhaps on the order of decades, may
yield greater responses in the native plant community. Val-
one et al. (2002) documented a time lag in the response
of perennial grass cover to cattle removal that exceeded
20 years, and climatic conditions such as drought may fur-
ther mask the effects of cattle removal (Fuhlendorf et al.
2001). Although we anticipate more profound effects of
cattle removal on the plant community as this experiment
matures, the recovery of native species may be inhibited
by a lack of propagules. Preliminary evidence suggests
that the seed bank does not include a reserve of grazing-
intolerant species (M.R.R.L., unpublished data), so active
reseeding programs may be necessary to increase plant
diversity.
We documented potential benefits to plant diversity
from moderate grazing practices that may be the result of
patch-scale grazing increasing community heterogeneity,
but this prediction needs testing with empirical research
at larger spatial scales. Indeed, animal behavior could vary
with pasture size, and site-specific characteristics may
modify or reverse the effect of any grazing practice. In a
Californian grassland, grazing on serpentine soil increases
species richness by 17%, but has the opposite effect for
communities in nearby nonserpentine soils (Harrison et
al. 2003). A precautionary approach to conserving biodi-
versity may warrant the application of multiple strategies
to achieve greater landscape heterogeneity (Christensen
1997; Wiens 1997). Fuhlendorf and Engle (2001) recom-
mend a landscape-scale approach that applies a hetero-
geneous patchwork of disturbance, such as grazing or
fire, followed by periods of rest. Results of the applica-
tion of this approach in the mesic tallgrass prairie show
landscape-scale increases in plant diversity (Fuhlendorf
& Engle 2001), but data are limited for dry-land regions.
Our results suggest that the combined species richness
in cattle removal and moderate grazing treatments could
exceed the species richness of moderate grazing alone;
however the response was inconsistent. The site-specific
qualities of plant composition, soil type, and climatic con-
ditions present a challenge to conservation planning that
may be best addressed with on-site experimentation with
management actions, such as demonstrated here for a
semiarid southwestern grassland.
