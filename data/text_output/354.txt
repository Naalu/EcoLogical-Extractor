Abstract
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of the southwestern United States are a mosaic
of stands where undisturbed forests are carbon sinks, and stands recovering from
wildﬁres may be sources of carbon to the atmosphere for decades after the ﬁre. However,
the relative magnitude of these sinks and sources has never been directly measured in
this region, limiting our understanding of the role of ﬁre in regional and US carbon
budgets. We used the eddy covariance technique to measure the CO2 exchange of two
forest sites, one burned by ﬁre in 1996, and an unburned forest. The ﬁre was a high-
intensity stand-replacing burn that killed all trees. Ten years after the ﬁre, the burned
site was still a source of CO2 to the atmosphere [109  6 (SEM) g C m2 yr1], whereas the
unburned site was a sink (164  23 g C m2 yr1). The ﬁre reduced total carbon storage
and shifted ecosystem carbon allocation from the forest ﬂoor and living biomass
to
necromass.

in gross primary production was even larger (372  13 g C m2 yr1 at the burned site and
858  37 g C m2 yr1at the unburned site). Water availability controlled carbon ﬂux in the
warm season at both sites, and the burned site was a source of carbon in all months, even
during the summer, when wet and warm conditions favored respiration more than
photosynthesis. Our study shows that carbon losses following stand-replacing ﬁres in
ponderosa pine forests can persist for decades due to slow recovery of the gross primary
production. Because ﬁre exclusion is becoming increasingly difﬁcult in dry western
forests, a large US forest carbon sink could shift to a decadal-scale carbon source.

Introduction
Terrestrial ecosystems strongly inﬂuence the global
carbon cycle and, combined with oceans, are estimated
to absorb about half of the carbon dioxide (CO2) cur-
rently released by human activities (Schimel et al., 2001;
Dilling et al., 2003). Simulated global patterns of carbon
ﬂux suggest that forests dominated by ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa), including those represented by our
study sites in northern Arizona, are a carbon sink
(Potter & Klooster, 1999). Yet regional estimates of
carbon sequestration by terrestrial ecosystems are likely
overestimated, because most studies avoid recently
disturbed sites and do not adequately consider impact
of disturbance on carbon ﬂuxes (Pacala et al., 2001;
Breshears & Allen, 2002; Hurtt et al., 2002; Schimel &
Baker, 2002; Dilling et al., 2003; Litton et al., 2003; Saleska
et al., 2003; Law et al., 2004; Misson et al., 2005). Simula-
tions and empirical data suggest that stand-scale CO2
ﬂux depends strongly on stand age and time since
disturbance (Thornton et al., 2002; Amiro et al., 2003;
Law et al., 2003; Song & Woodcock, 2003; Pregitzer &
Euskirchen, 2004). Elucidation of the magnitude, spatial

and temporal scales, and biological processes of such
inﬂuences is essential to improve estimates of carbon
balance in forested landscapes.
Stand-replacing wildﬁres cause a sudden conversion
of carbon stored in vegetation and soil to CO2, which is
then released to the atmosphere. Such short-term effects
of ﬁre can be reasonably estimated from information on
fuel consumption and extent of burning (Auclair &
Carter, 1993; Conard & Ivanova, 1997; Harden et al.,
2000; Page et al., 2002; Law et al., 2004). Longer term
effects of ﬁre on the carbon balance are more uncertain
and are inﬂuenced by ﬁre effects on local hydrology,
surface energy exchange, soil temperature (Amiro et al.,
1999), rate of vegetation recovery (Amiro et al., 2003;
Law et al., 2003; Litton et al., 2003; Kashian et al., 2006),
soil respiration, and erosion of soil organic carbon
(Black & Harden, 1994).
The effects of ﬁre on the carbon balance can last for
variable periods, depending on the intensity of the ﬁre
and the recovery of the ecosystem. Several studies show
that ﬁre reduces net ecosystem production in young,
regrowing stands, because decomposition of necromass
produced from the disturbance causes heterotrophic
respiration to exceed net primary production, changing
the ecosystem from a sink to a source of CO2 (Amiro,
2001; Thornton et al., 2002; Wirth et al., 2002; Law et al.,
2004; Randerson et al., 2006). In intensively managed
pine forests, 2–5 years may elapse after disturbance
before regrowing forests shift from a carbon source to
a sink (Thornton et al., 2002; Misson et al., 2005), while
the same transition may require 10–30 years for conifers
in the Paciﬁc Northwest United States (Cohen et al.,
1996; Law et al., 2001) and many decades for boreal
forests (Schulze et al., 2000; Fredeen et al., 2007). Current
understanding of the effects of severe ﬁre or high-
intensity harvesting on carbon ﬂuxes in ponderosa pine
forests suggests that it may take 50–100 years to replace
the carbon lost from these disturbances and a period of
10–20 years to shift the ecosystem from a carbon source
to a carbon sink (Law et al., 2001). These estimates from
more mesic forests (Thornton et al., 2002; Amiro et al.,
2003; Law et al., 2003; Litton et al., 2003; Kashian et al.,
2006) may have limited application in southwestern
ponderosa pine forests, where the drier climate appears
to slow recovery following stand-replacing wildﬁre
(Savage et al., 1996; Savage & Mast, 2005).
Over a century of ﬁre suppression and heavy live-
stock grazing have eliminated the natural low-intensity
surface ﬁre regime of ponderosa pine forests in most
areas of the southwestern United States (Cooper, 1960;
Swetnam & Baisan, 1996; Fule´ et al., 1997). Ecosystem
structure has shifted from open savanna-like forests
maintained by frequent (every 3–25 years) surface ﬁres
to dense forests of small trees with little understory
(Covington et al., 1994; Swetnam & Baisan, 1996; Fule´
et al., 1997). This shift is considered an important
component of the recent carbon sink of terrestrial eco-
systems (Potter & Klooster, 1999; Houghton et al., 2000;
Pacala et al., 2001; Schimel et al., 2001; Hibbard et al.,
2003), but the sink is not sustainable because increasing
carbon storage in woody fuels (Covington et al., 1994;
Covington et al., 2001; Keane et al., 2002; Fule´ et al., 2004;
Moore et al., 2004) and recent climate warming (Brown
et al., 2004; Westerling et al., 2006) lead to stand-
replacing wildﬁres in arid and semiarid forests that
cover large areas of the western United States (GAO,
1998; Breshears & Allen, 2002). Measurements of carbon
exchange in burned and ﬁre-suppressed, unburned
forests provide data necessary for understanding the
carbon balance implications of different forest manage-
ment strategies in semiarid regions. Attempts to mea-
sure or predict spatial variation in carbon sinks for the
western United States will have large errors if impacts
of severe ﬁre are not considered.
The overall objective of this study was to evaluate the
effects of stand-replacing ﬁre on the carbon cycle of
ponderosa pine forests in northern Arizona. We mea-
sured ecosystem CO2 and water ﬂuxes for 17 months
(2005–2006) in an unburned ponderosa pine forest and a
forest that was burned by a high-intensity stand-
replacing wildﬁre that killed all trees in 1996 to (1)
compare carbon ﬂuxes, pools, and environmental re-
sponses of ﬂuxes, and (2) provide the ﬁrst data on
ecosystem carbon ﬂuxes, using eddy covariance for
ponderosa pine forests of the southwestern United
States.
Materials and methods
Study sites
Our study compares two ponderosa pine sites: an
unmanaged, undisturbed forest and a forest that
burned in a stand-replacing wildﬁre. The sites are
located 35 km apart, in the vicinity of Flagstaff, in
northern Arizona, United States.
The unburned site is located on the Northern Arizona
University Centennial Forest (3515020.500N, 111145043.3300W,
elevation 2180ma.s.l.) and represents a typical example of
the ponderosa pine forests of this area, with no distur-
bances (harvests, thinning, or ﬁres) having occurred for
many decades. Season maximum leaf area index (LAI,
projected area) during the study was 2.3, tree basal area
was 30m2ha1, and average tree age was 87 years
(Table 1). The forest is dominated by ponderosa pine
and includes a sparse understory (maximum LAI 0.06)
of grasses and forbs.

The burned site is located on the Coconino National
Forest (35126043.4300N, 111146018.6400W, elevation 2270 m
a.s.l.) in a 10 500 ha area burned by a high-intensity
stand-replacing wildﬁre in 1996. The ground surface
of the site is covered with sparse grasses, shrubs, and
woody debris (WD) produced by the ﬁre. Before the
ﬁre, the burned site had stand characteristics similar to
the unburned site (Table 1). Since the 1996 ﬁre, no
postﬁre management, such as salvage logging or tree
planting, has occurred at the site, and no tree seedlings
have established. The vegetation at the site consists
of grasses (Bromus tectorum, Elymus repens), shrubs
(Ceanothus
fendleri),
and
forbs
(Oxytropis
lambertii,
Verbascum thapsus, Linaria dalmatica, Circium wheeleri).
The climate of the area is characterized by cold
winters, sunny but dry springs, and irregular and
moderate annual precipitation (610 mm, 30-year aver-
age, Western Regional Climatic Center, http://www.
wrcc.dri.edu/index.html) about equally divided be-
tween winter and the July–August monsoon season
(Sheppard et al., 2002). The two sites had similar incom-
ing radiation and seasonal trends for most of the
measured meteorological variables during the study
(Table 2, Fig. 1). The main environmental differences
between the sites can be explained by the absence of the
tree canopy cover at the burned site, where soil and air
temperatures were lower in the winter and higher in the
summer, soil water content (SWC) was lower, and vapor
pressure deﬁcit (VPD) higher compared with that at the
unburned site (Table 2, Fig. 1). Precipitation in 2006 was
also lower at the burned site than at the unburned site
(Table 2, Fig. 1).
Stand characteristics were measured at ﬁve 25 m
radius circular plots located in the eddy covariance
footprint at each site. The plots were located between
150 and 400 m in the prevailing wind direction, in the
east–west section from the towers. At the burned site,
preﬁre stand characteristics were determined in 2006
from adjacent, unburned areas. Diameter at breast
height (1.4 m above ground) was measured for all trees
in the plots and was used to calculate basal area, LAI,
and biomass, using allometric equations and speciﬁc
leaf area developed for ponderosa pine in northern
Arizona (Kaye et al., 2005; McDowell et al., 2006). Allo-
metric equations developed for ponderosa pine in New
Mexico (Omdal et al., 2001) were used to estimate coarse
root biomass at the unburned site. Understory LAI was
measured at each site at four, 0.5 m2 subplots for each of
the ﬁve plots (total 20 per site). All understory vegeta-
tion was clipped from the subplots at the time of peak
standing crop (late September 2006), and projected leaf
area was measured in the laboratory with an image
analyzer (Agvision, Monochrome System, Decagon
Devices Inc., Pullman, WA, USA). Fine root biomass
(diameter o2 mm) was obtained at the two sites in
2006 at each of the ﬁve plots from three soil cores (total
15 per site) of 20.4 cm2 in area and a depth of 15 cm,
where most of the ﬁne root biomass is concentrated
(Hart et al., 2005). Roots were extracted from the soil
with a hydropneumatic elutriation system (Scienceware
Bel-Art Products, Pequannock, NJ, USA). The carbon
content of the mineral soil was obtained from Grady &
Hart’s (2006) study of the same ﬁre for samples col-
lected in 2005.

Fine WD (diameter o7.5 cm) was measured at each
site, using the Brown method (1974) on four 3.7 m
transects from each plot center. Coarse WD (diameter
47.5 cm) was measured on four, 0.04 ha plots per site.
Length, top, middle, and base diameters of coarse WD
were recorded, and mass was calculated using New-
ton’s formula and a bulk density of 0.4 g cm3 (Harmon
& Sexton, 1996). WD was calculated as the sum of ﬁne
and coarse materials. Forest ﬂoor depth was measured
on nine evenly spaced points along each transect and
converted to mass (Ffolliot et al., 1968). Of this mass,
25% was subtracted as mineral soil, and the forest ﬂoor
carbon pool (Fule´, 1990) was then determined using a
carbon concentration of 0.58 g carbon per gram forest
ﬂoor (Nelson & Sommers, 1982). The carbon concentra-
tion of the organic matter of all other pools was
assumed to be 0.50 g carbon per gram dry weight.
Decomposition of WD was estimated at each site based
on changes in speciﬁc gravity of WD from a chronose-
quence (Erickson et al., 1985; Harmon & Sexton, 1996).
The chronosequence at the burned site consisted of
10-year-old WD produced by the ﬁre (n 5 25) and fresh
WD produced by logging at a nearby site in 2006
(n 5 35). The chronosequence at the unburned site con-
sisted of 20-year-old WD produced by thinning at a
nearby site (n 5 25 slash piles) and fresh WD produced
by logging at another nearby site (n 5 35).
Eddy measurements
The data we present were collected between September
2005 and December 2006. We used the same equipment
at each site: a closed-path analyzer (Li-7000, LI-COR,
Lincoln, NE, USA), a 3-D sonic anemometer (CSAT3,
Campbell Scientiﬁc, Logan, UT, USA), and a pump
(N89, KNF Neuberger, Freiburg, Germany) drawing
air with a ﬂow of 10 L min1 through Teﬂon tubing of
4 mm i.d. Tubing was 9 m long at the burned site and
4 m long at the unburned site. Every 2 weeks, the air
intake ﬁlters (Acro 50, Gelman Sci., Ann Arbor, MI,
USA, 1 mm pore diameter) were changed and the ana-
lyzers were calibrated maintaining the analyzer cells at
the same pressure occurring during sampling. The eddy
covariance system was positioned at a height of 23 m,
5 m above the canopy (18 m) at the unburned site and
4 m above the ground at the burned site. Data were
recorded at 20 Hz by a datalogger (CR1000, Campbell
Scientiﬁc, and 2 Gbyte memory cards, SanDisk, USA)
and averaged over 30-min intervals. Raw data were
postprocessed in the laboratory using the software
MASE (designed by G. Manca, JRC Italy, following Au-
binet et al., 2000). In particular, the 30-min ﬂuxes were
quality ﬂagged using the Carboeurope methodology
(steady-state test and integral turbulence characteristic
test; Foken & Vichura, 1996; http://www.geo.uni-bayr
euth.de/mikrometeorologie/QC_Workshop/QA_QC_
012.f90). Precipitation, variances in the measured sca-
lars, spikes, and number of rejected data during the
30-min intervals were additional parameters considered
in the quality assessment.
At the unburned site, the storage ﬂuxes were com-
puted until July 2006 using the concentration measured
by the analyzer at the top of the tower (Hollinger et al.,
1999; Morgenstern et al., 2004), and afterwards using a
CO2, water, and temperature proﬁle. The proﬁle system
sampled at 1, 8, and 16 m in addition to the 23 m height
sampled by the eddy system analyzer. An infrared gas
analyzer (LI-840, LI-COR) measured concentrations of

water and CO2, switching every 20 s between three lines
where the ﬂow was maintained at 1 L min1. A 1 L
volume buffer, averaging the air collected in the pre-
vious minute, allowed the three heights to be measured
continuously. At the burned site, no proﬁle was
installed because of the low stature of the vegetation,
and the storage term was estimated using the top
concentration measurements.
Meteorological measurements at the two sites in-
cluded global and net radiation calculated from the
incoming and outgoing short- and long-wave radiation
(CNR1, Kipp and Zonen, Delft, the Netherlands), total
and diffuse photosynthetic photon ﬂux density (PPFD;
with BF3 DeltaT devices, Cambridge, UK), reﬂected
PPFD (LI-190, LI-COR), and precipitation (5.4103.20.041
Thies Clima, Goettingen, Germany). In addition, wind
speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, precipita-
tion, air humidity, and air temperature were measured
at both sites with the same instrument (WXT510,
Vaisala, Helsinki, Finland). Volumetric SWC (ECH2O-
EC20 Decagon, Pullman, WA, USA) and soil tempera-
ture (107, Campbell Scientiﬁc)
were measured at
mineral soil depths of 2, 10, 20, and 50 cm. The SWC
sensors were calibrated for soil A and B horizons of
both sites in the laboratory, under controlled conditions
(e.g. McMichael & Lascano, 2003). In addition, an
equation to correct for the sensor sensitivity to tempera-
ture was determined empirically. Soil heat ﬂux was
measured at depth of 8 cm (HFP01SC Hukseﬂux, Delft,
the Netherlands) at both sites and additionally at the
unburned site with a second sensor (HFT3 REBS Inc.,
Seattle, WA, USA) because of the high spatial variability

at this site. SWC and soil temperature (averaged be-
tween 2 and 6 cm mineral soil depths) were measured
within 50 cm of the soil heat ﬂux plates to allow for
calculation of soil heat storage. All meteorological para-
meters were measured every 15 s and recorded at 30-
min intervals by a datalogger (CR10X 1 AM16-32 multi-
plexer, Campbell Scientiﬁc). The systems were powered
by 12 V solar panels, positioned more than 30 m from
the anemometer.
We report carbon source to the atmosphere as a
positive ﬂux and carbon sink as a negative ﬂux. Net
ecosystem exchange (NEE) included the storage term
and is used to refer to instantaneous ﬂuxes, as well as
long-term monthly and annual sums. Ecosystem gross
primary production (GPP) was considered to be the
same as gross ecosystem production (GEP; Law et al.,
2002) and was calculated for daytime conditions at a 30-
min interval as NEE 1 total ecosystem respiration
(TER). Daytime TER was calculated from the relation-
ship between night-time TER and soil temperature
(Law et al., 2002; Richardson et al., 2006). GPP was set
to 0 during night-time conditions, even if NEE 1 TER
was negative (thus suggesting night-time carbon up-
take; Giasson et al., 2006), and this caused a slight
imbalance of carbon ﬂuxes on an annual scale, so that
annual NEE was not equal to annual GPPannual TER
(difference of 16 g m2 yr1 at the unburned site and
1 g m2 yr1 at the burned site).
Gap-ﬁlling
We divided data into three quality classes: good, inter-
mediate, and bad (http://www.geo.uni-bayreuth.de/
mikrometeorologie/QC_Workshop/QA_QC_012.f90).
The good-quality data were used to determine the
relationships of NEE, GPP, and TER with environmen-
tal factors. The intermediate-quality data were included
in computations of daily, monthly, and annual sums.
Bad-quality data were excluded from all analyses and
were replaced by modeled data for the daily, monthly,
and yearly carbon budget calculations. The datasets of
the two sites were treated with the same analytical
criteria and procedures.
We estimated uncertainty in the annual carbon bud-
get by assessing the sensitivity of the annual sums to
different ﬁltering criteria and different procedures for
ﬁlling bad-quality and missing data (e.g. McCaughey
et al., 2006). Data were gap-ﬁlled using look-up tables
and nonlinear regressions (Falge et al., 2001). Look-up
tables were built using 2 months best quality datasets
(up to 4 months for winter TER). For night-time NEE,
2 1C soil temperature classes and SWC classes (from two
to three classes depending on the measured range) were
used. For daytime NEE, 200 mmol m2 s1 PPFD classes
and one additional environmental factor that explained
the most variation in NEE were used. This factor was
SWC in four to ﬁve classes depending on the measured
range, or VPD in 0.5 kPa classes, or soil temperature in 2
or 5 1C classes. Nonlinear regressions were ﬁtted on
monthly good-quality datasets, using a rectangular
hyperbola equation (Ruimy et al., 1995) for daytime
NEE, and on a bimonthly basis, using a Q10 relationship
with soil temperature for night-time NEE (Richardson
et al., 2006). Two-month intervals were used to reconcile
the lack of best quality data of shorter periods with the
need to include the short-time sensitivity of ecosystem
respiration to temperature (Reichstein et al., 2005;
Richardson et al., 2006). The use of only temperature
for this night-time NEE gap-ﬁlling approach is based on
the assumption that the bimonthly relationship indir-
ectly includes the effect of other parameters, such as
SWC, phenology, litter and substrate availability, that
are often difﬁcult to measure adequately (Curiel et al.,
2004). Next, we used three different data ﬁltering criter-
ia. The ﬁrst was the replacement of bad-quality data
with gap-ﬁlled data. The second was the replacement of
bad-quality data and the application of u* ﬁltering,
where u* ﬁltering consists of rejecting night-time TER,
when u* is below a site-speciﬁc threshold. The third was
the application of only u* ﬁltering, which is used in
most eddy covariance studies (Falge et al., 2001; Aubinet
et al., 2002; Hollinger & Richardson, 2005; Humphreys
et al., 2006; Morgenstern et al., 2004; Stoy et al., 2006).
The combination of different gap-ﬁlling and data ﬁlter-
ing methods produced seven different procedures:
(1) look-up tables applied to bad-quality data, (2)
look-up tables applied to bad-quality and u*-ﬁltered
data, (3) nonlinear regression applied to bad-quality
data, (4) nonlinear regression applied to bad-quality
and u*-ﬁltered data, (5) nonlinear regression applied
to u*-ﬁltered data, (6) an automatic gap-ﬁlling proce-
dure available on the web (Markus Reichstein, Max
Planck Institute, Germany; http://gaia.agraria.unitus.
it/database/eddyproc/) applied without u* ﬁltering,
and (7) the same automatic gap-ﬁlling procedure avail-
able on the web, with u* ﬁltering.
At the burned site, 5% of the data were missing in
2006, 43% of the data were gap-ﬁlled because they were
missing or bad, and 60% were gap-ﬁlled when u*
ﬁltering was also applied. In contrast, the standard u*
ﬁltering application replaced only 25% of the data at the
burned site. At the unburned site, 14% of the data were
missing in 2006, 32% of the data were gap-ﬁlled because
they were missing or bad, and 46% were gap-ﬁlled
when the u* ﬁltering was also applied. The standard
u* ﬁltering application replaced only 40% of the data at
the unburned site. Data losses and data rejection were
in the same range as for similar studies (Baldocchi et al.,

2001; Falge et al., 2001; McCaughey et al., 2006). Com-
pared with the unburned site, high wind speed was
more frequent during both day and night, and good-
quality data, particularly during the day, were always
less frequent at the burned site (Fig. 2). An increase in
wind speed decreased data quality at the burned site,
whereas it increased the data quality at the unburned
site (Fig. 2).
The site-speciﬁc u* threshold used in the night-time
TER u* ﬁltering procedure was calculated using only
the best quality data following Reichstein et al. (2005)
and was 0.3 m s1 at the burned site and 0.2 m s1 at the
unburned site. The same methodology applied by the
automatic on-line gap-ﬁlling tool on night-time TER
data of all qualities gave a threshold of 0.1 m s1 at both
sites and resulted in a lower amount of gap-ﬁlled data.
The daily energy balance closure (Aubinet et al., 2000;
Wilson et al., 2002) for 2006, excluding days with snow
on the ground, was 0.92 (r2 5 0.90, Po0.0001, n 5 302)
for the burned site and 0.84 (r2 5 0.94, Po0.0001,
n 5 262) for the unburned site (data not shown), and it
was in the range of what is often measured by eddy
covariance (Wilson et al., 2002). The difference in closure
between sites can be attributed to site-speciﬁc charac-
teristics, considering that identical settings, equipment,
and software were used at the two sites. A possible
reason for this difference is the high spatial heteroge-
neity at the unburned site caused by groups of trees
alternating with irregularly sized openings, resulting in
different footprints for eddy covariance and net radia-
tion measurements.
We analyzed the relationship between NEE and PPFD
(30-min data) on a monthly basis by ﬁtting the best
quality data with a rectangular hyperbola model, de-
termining night-time TER, apparent quantum yield,
and maximum assimilation (Ruimy et al., 1995). A Q10
function was used for night-time TER. The 30-min
residuals (difference between the modeled and the
measured values for night-time TER, and for daytime
NEE when PPFD 4800 mmol m2 s1) were regressed
against other environmental factors with a second-
degree
polynomial,

plotted for each month and factor.
We compared the effect of diffuse light on NEE
between the burned and unburned sites. NEE of CO2
for clear and cloudy conditions (diffuse PPFD o30%
and 460% of total PPFD, respectively) was averaged
using 200 mmol m2 s1 PPFD classes. We assumed that

night-time NEE data were not affected by the daytime
contribution of diffuse PPFD, and thus the night-time
average was used for both cloudy and clear sky condi-
tions. Often, on a monthly basis, clear and cloudy
conditions did not overlap: cloudy conditions were
common only at low PPFD and did not occur at high
PPFD, while the opposite trend occurred for clear sky
conditions. For each PPFD class, we also calculated
average VPD, air temperature, soil temperature, and
SWC. For the burned site, the diffuse light analysis
was limited by a short growing season, and technical
problems with the diffuse PPFD measurements oc-
curred during July–August 2006. Consequently, we
analyzed data from October 2006 for both sites and
compared August and October 2006 for the unburned
site only.
Results and discussion
Carbon ﬂuxes
Because of similar preﬁre stand and soil characteristic
(Table 1) and local climate (Fig. 1, Table 2) between the
sites, the differences measured in this study can be
attributed to the wildﬁre. The stand-replacing ﬁre al-
tered both the abiotic (e.g. soil temperature) and the
biotic (e.g. biomass, LAI) characteristics of the ecosys-
tem. The ﬁre had a large effect on NEE, even 10 years
after the ﬁre (Figs 3, 5 and 6). Compared with the
unburned site, NEE was lower at the burned site and
CO2 uptake was limited to a very short period (Fig. 3).
In contrast to large parts of the world, including pon-
derosa pine forests in Oregon (Law et al., 2000) and
California (Misson et al., 2005), where the months of
May and June are often characterized by peaks in NEE
(Baldocchi et al., 2001; Aubinet et al., 2002; Morgestern
et al., 2004; McCaughey et al., 2006), NEE was low
during June at our sites (Fig. 3) and reached its max-
imum only during the wet July–August monsoon sea-
son (Fig. 3). The NEE peak was in August at the
unburned site (monthly light curve maximum assim-
ilation 517 mmol m2 s1), and in September, after the
full leaf development of the herbaceous annual plants,
at the burned site (monthly light curve maximum
assimilation 57.7 mmol m2 s1). At the unburned site,
as in other coniferous (Hollinger et al., 1999; Morgen-
stern et al., 2004) and ponderosa pine forests (Anthoni
et al., 1999; Misson et al., 2005), CO2 uptake occurred in
winter, when environmental conditions were favorable
(Figs 3 and 5).

The effect of SWC on CO2 uptake is illustrated
by comparing the dry and warm October 2005 and the
wet and cooler October 2006 at the unburned site.
Weekly averages of the ﬁrst 3 weeks of October were
used in the comparison. Compared with October
2006, GPP in October 2005 was substantially lower
(23.9 g C m2 week1
vs.
7.4 g C m2 week1),
while
TER was only moderately lower (16.9 g C m2 week1
vs. 12.5 g C m2 week1). The changes likely reﬂect the
greater sensitivity of GPP to drought than TER (Fig. 4),
as has been reported previously (Misson et al., 2005;
Granier et al., 2007). In addition, only the effect of the
increased SWC on TER was counteracted by the effect
of the decreased soil temperature, suggesting that TER
was more sensitive to temperature than was GPP
(Fig. 4). The increase in SWC in late October 2005 was
quickly followed by an increase in NEE at the unburned
site (Fig. 3). The same SWC increase did not increase
NEE at the burned site, because of the already advanced
senescence of the herbaceous vegetation.
Wildﬁre shifted the monthly and annual carbon bud-
gets from a CO2 sink at the unburned site to a CO2
source at the burned site (Fig. 5), due primarily to lower
GPP at the burned site. In many ecosystems, distur-
bances, such as ﬁre, are expected to increase TER
because of increased above- and belowground necro-
mass and an increase in soil decomposition rate. How-
ever, little effects or even reduced TER have been
measured in the past in conifers (Amiro, 2001; Kowalski
et al., 2003; Misson et al., 2005; Giasson et al., 2006; Irvine
et al., 2007). Kowalski et al. (2004) summarized the
effects of disturbance on TER in two different cases
depending on species: (1) TER is increased by distur-
bance in resprouting species, where the belowground

system did not die after the disturbance; (2) TER is
decreased by disturbance in nonsprouting species,
where the decrease in living biomass, exudates, and
photosynthetic assimilates is more important than the
increase in decaying necromass. In our study, lower
GPP was more important than a change in TER in
decreasing NEE at the burned site. The burned site
was a source of carbon during every month of 2006
(Fig. 5). Even during the warm and wet conditions in
August and September, the most favorable period for
carbon uptake at the burned site, TER was stimulated to
a greater extent than GPP, resulting in the site being a
net source of carbon to the atmosphere.
The different gap-ﬁlling methodologies produced
different estimates of yearly NEE (Fig. 6), but all esti-
mates showed that the burned site was a net carbon
source, whereas the unburned site was a net carbon
sink. The use of look-up tables or monthly nonlinear
regression for gap-ﬁlling had a small effect on the total
annual carbon balance at both sites (maximum differ-
ence of 9 g C m2 yr1). In contrast, the ﬁltering criteria
had larger consequences. For example, a difference of
95 g C m2 yr1 was found if annual NEE at the un-
burned site was calculated by gap-ﬁlling only bad-
quality data or by also applying the u* ﬁltering
(Fig. 6). In all cases, adding the quality check of NEE
to the traditional u* ﬁltering increased the amount
of
gap-ﬁlled
data,
resulting
in
a
difference
of
21 g C m2 yr1 in annual NEE at the burned site, and
10 g C m2 yr1 at the unburned site (Fig. 6). Applying
the standard on-line gap-ﬁlling procedure caused dif-
ferences in the annual NEE only if the u* ﬁltering was
not considered (Fig. 6).
Annual NEE, calculated as an average ( SEM) of the
seven methods, was 109 ( 6) g C m2 at the burned site
and 164 ( 23) g C m2 at the unburned site; annual
TER was 480 ( 5) g C m2 at the burned site and 710
( 54) g C m2 at the unburned site; annual GPP was
372 ( 13) g C m2 at the burned site and 858
( 37) g C m2 at the unburned site (Fig. 5). The ratio
of annual NEE to GPP was 0.19 for the burned site and
0.30 for the unburned site, compared with 0.27 for a
ponderosa pine forest in Oregon (Anthoni et al., 1999).
Annual TER/GPP was 1.3 at the burned site and 0.83 at
the unburned site, compared with 0.70 reported by
Granier et al. (2007) for various European forest ecosys-
tems, and very similar to the value reported for conifers
(0.85; Law et al., 2002) and to the value found for an
unburned ponderosa pine forest in Oregon (0.82;
Anthoni et al., 1999).
Ten years after the ﬁre, the burned forest was a
moderate carbon source, while the unburned site was
a moderate carbon sink. This ﬁnding is in agreement
with other studies, where disturbances such as ﬁre,
wind throw, or harvest caused ecosystems to become
carbon sources (Amiro, 2001; Knohl et al., 2002; Thorn-
ton et al., 2002; Wirth et al., 2002; Humphreys et al.,
2006). Thornton et al. (2002) reported that the modeled

carbon compensation point, the time taken for an eco-
system to become a net sink for carbon, differed among
sites and depended on the type of disturbance, with
longer periods for ﬁre and shorter periods for harvests.
The carbon compensation point for ponderosa pine
forest after stand replacing ﬁre was one of the longest
(14–16 years) in the Thornton et al. (2002) analysis. The
carbon compensation point depends on species, cli-
mate, management type and intensity, and frequency
of disturbance and is estimated to range from 2 to 30
years (Cohen et al., 1996; Schulze et al., 1999; Litvak et al.,
2003; Bond-Lamberty et al., 2004; Kowalski et al., 2004).
Our burned site is still a carbon source of 109 g m2 yr1
in the 10th year after burning, and no trees have
established yet. Likely, the site will not shift to a carbon
sink until the vegetation cover re-establishes, which
could take many decades (e.g. Savage & Mast, 2005).
Carbon pools
Ten years after the ﬁre, the burned site contained
substantially less (53%) total carbon than the unburned
site (Table 3). The mineral soil carbon content was
similar between sites (Grady & Hart, 2006), but in the
burned site, the aboveground biomass carbon was only
2%, the forest ﬂoor 12%, and the ﬁne root carbon 31% of
the pools found at the unburned site. In contrast, WD at
the burned site was ﬁve times greater than that at the
unburned site and constituted 43% of the total carbon of
the burned site (Table 3). But despite the high contribu-
tion of this pool to the total ecosystem carbon, the
decomposition of the aboveground WD, calculated
using a site-speciﬁc empirically determined annual
decomposition
constant
(k)
of
0.031,
was
only
78 g C m2 yr1, 16% of the yearly TER. At the unburned
site, k was 0.014 and ﬂux from aboveground WD to the
atmosphere was calculated to be 7 g C m2 yr1, 1% of
the yearly TER. The k values determined in our study
are in the same range of other ponderosa pine studies
[0.015 in Turner et al., in the Rocky Mountains (1995),
and 0.027 in Law et al. (2001) in Oregon]. The higher k at
the burned compared with that at the unburned site
might be related to colonization of ﬁre-killed trees
by bark beetles and wood borers (McHugh et al., 2003)
that accelerate subsequent decomposition and could
explain the slightly higher respiration losses per stored
carbon at the burned site: the respiratory loss of carbon
per unit of stored carbon was 0.081 g C m2 yr1 at the

unburned site.
Environmental control: daytime NEE
We assessed whether SWC and soil temperature at
different depths, water vapor deﬁcit (VPD), and air
temperature were important controls on daytime NEE
by examining residuals (modeled minus measured va-
lue) from regression of light-saturated NEE on PPFD.
Correlations between residuals and the environmental
factors varied over months (Fig. 7a), and the highest
value of r2 was 0.70. In general, the residuals were more
weakly correlated with the environmental factors when
the relationship between PPFD and NEE was tighter
(for example at the unburned site in April 2006, r2 was
0.86, Po0.0001, n 5 917) and were more strongly corre-
lated for the unburned site than for the burned site
(Fig. 7a). The seasonal trend in the correlations was
similar for all SWC and temperature depths, but the
relative contribution of the different depths to mea-
sured NEE changed each month. In general, the correla-
tion between NEE and SWC was highest from March to
August, whereas correlations between NEE and soil
temperature increased during winter (Fig. 7a). Most
environmental factors were correlated with NEE in
May. Air temperature and VPD often were correlated
with NEE only at the unburned site. In short, no single
environmental factor secondary to PPFD consistently
predicted daily NEE, and the two sites did not behave
the same. Correlations between NEE and environmen-
tal factors other than PPFD were higher in our study
than in others, where r2o0.25 (Hollinger et al., 1994;
Aubinet et al., 2002; Giasson et al., 2006). This difference
among sites is likely in part biological and site speciﬁc,
as the dissimilarity of our two sites shows, and in part
methodological,
as
we
restricted
the
analysis
of
residuals to the best quality data and the light-saturated
part of the day.
At both sites, NEE per unit light availability (quantum
yield, F) was higher under cloudy conditions than that
under clear conditions (Fig. 8, Table 4), consistent with
many other studies (Hollinger et al., 1994; Goulden et al.,
1997; Baldocchi et al., 2001; Law et al., 2002). This effect
has been explained as a greater penetration of diffuse
light deep into the canopy (Oechel & Lawrence, 1985;
Weiss, 2000) or, alternatively, because environmental
conditions more favorable for carbon assimilation, such
as lower VPD, occur on cloudy days (Gu et al., 2002). We
expected that at the burned site, where the canopy is
very open (LAI 0.6), greater penetration of diffuse
radiation in the canopy would be minimal. However,
an increase in the apparent quantum yield (F) between
clear and cloudy conditions occurred at both sites (Table
4). Environmental factors at the unburned site differed
between August and October (e.g. air temperature was
higher for clear conditions in August but lower in
October; Fig. 8), thus confounding the effect of cloudi-
ness and environmental conditions. However, August
was mostly warm and wet, and the lower VPD, air
temperature, and higher SWC found in cloudy versus
clear conditions were more favorable for NEE. In con-
trast, in October, when lower temperatures limited NEE,
cloudy conditions were associated with higher air and
soil temperatures, slightly lower SWC, and similar, low
VPD (1 kPa compared with 1.6kPa in August) compared
with clear conditions. Thus, we conclude that NEE was
stimulated by cloudy conditions because of more favor-
able environment conditions for photosynthesis and not
because of enhancement of photosynthesis by deeper
light penetration into the canopy.
Environmental control: night-time NEE
Residuals between night-time TER modeled from tem-
perature and measured night-time TER were weakly
correlated with all environmental variables, for both the
burned and unburned sites (Fig. 7b). It is possible that a

relationship between TER and environmental factors
other than soil temperature was less obvious than for
daytime NEE (Fig. 7a) because, unlike for CO2 uptake,
several processes and different CO2 sources, with pos-
sible counterbalancing effects, contribute to TER (Trum-
bore, 2006; Granier et al., 2007). It is also possible that,
compared with the daytime, the lower correlation in the
night was caused by the greater difﬁculty of measuring

night-time TER, and thus by the small night-time
dataset.
The correlation of soil temperature proﬁles and night-
time TER exhibited different patterns between the two
sites (Fig. 7b). At the burned site, 30-min TER was best
correlated with the deepest soil temperature (50 cm,
r2 5 0.23, Po0.0001, n 5 576) and at the unburned site
with the most shallow soil temperature (2 cm, r2 5 0.35,
Po0.0001, n 5 2804). The same trend was found by
Richardson et al. (2006) while comparing a northern
hardwood forest and a grassland. The difference could
be explained by differences in root distribution between
herbaceous and woody species, or by the contribution
of the litter layer, which was present only at the un-
burned site. Clearly, selection of drivers for ecosystem
ﬂuxes, such as the soil temperature depth, is difﬁcult to
generalize across different ecosystems.
The relationship between soil temperature and night-
time TER (1 year of data, temperature measured at a
common depth of 10 cm) was similar in shape for the
two sites. However, TER was consistently lower at the
burned than at the unburned site, even when SWC was

similar between sites (Fig. 9). Moreover, TER at the
burned site decreased at the highest temperature and
lowest SWC, conditions outside the range of those that
occurred at the unburned site (Fig. 9). The absolute
difference in TER between the two sites was smallest
(0.46 mmol m2 s1) at the lowest soil temperature and
largest (2.2 mmol m2 s1) at the highest soil temperature
recorded at both sites (Fig. 9). On an annual basis, the
burned site lost 480 ( 5 SEM) g C m2 yr1 via TER to
the atmosphere, considerably lower than the 710 ( 54
SEM) g C m2 yr1 lost by the unburned site (Fig. 5). A
cause of the lower TER at the burned compared with
the unburned site is smaller carbon pools at the burned
site: while there was no change in the mineral soil
carbon and the WD increased, the forest ﬂoor, ﬁne root
biomass, and the aboveground biomass decreased con-
siderably (Table 3). The lower SWC (at 10 cm) at the
burned site (Figs 1 and 3) may also contribute to the
lower TER. During all of 2006, in part because of the
lower precipitation and in part because of the absence
of shade created by the tree canopy, the burned site had
lower SWC than the unburned site, even though evapo-
transpiration (ET) was lower at the burned site than at
the unburned site (Fig. 9). Fitting the average night-time
TER for each soil temperature class (Fig. 9) with an
exponential model based only on soil temperature
(Lloyd & Taylor, 1994; Janssens et al., 2001; Reichstein
et al., 2005; Richardson et al., 2006) explained 60% of the
observed variation at the burned site and 93% at the

(Hanson et al., 1993; Richardson et al., 2006), the ex-
plained variation increased to 83% and 97%, respec-
tively, for the burned and unburned sites. The Q10 for
TER based on soil temperature (10 cm) was 1.75 ( 0.10
SEM) at the unburned site and 1.47 ( 0.15 SEM) at the
burned site, and it increased to 1.92 ( 0.16 SEM) at the
burned site if the soil temperature was limited to the
range also experienced at the unburned site. This result
is similar to data reported in other studies of ponderosa
pine: a Q10 of 1.8 was reported by Law et al. (1999) in
Oregon and 1.6 by Xu et al. (2001) for a young plantation
in California. The higher control on TER by SWC at the
burned site compared with the unburned site is likely
due to higher soil temperature and lower SWC at the
burned site. Reduction of TER by dry and warm con-
ditions has often been reported (Janssens et al., 2001;
Hart et al., 2006; Granier et al., 2007).
Controls over GPP and water use efﬁciency
GPP was less strongly linked to ET at the burned site
than at the unburned site (Fig. 10a). Lower LAI at the
burned site than at the unburned site (Table 2) can
explain the difference in the slope between sites. Water
use efﬁciency at the burned site was lower and less
tightly related to ET than at the unburned site (Fig. 10b).
More of the variation of GPP was explained by soil
temperature at the burned site than at the unburned site
(Fig. 10c). GPP was more responsive to VPD at the
unburned site than at the burned site (Fig. 10d) and
followed the same trend observed in other ponderosa
pine forests (Anthoni et al., 1999).
Conclusion
The ponderosa pine forest that we studied in northern
Arizona, 10 years after a stand-replacing ﬁre, was a
moderate carbon source (109 g C m2 yr1) compared
with a moderate carbon sink (164 g C m2 yr1) ob-
served in a nearby unburned stand. The most pronoun-
ced effect of the ﬁre was to reduce photosynthesis (GPP
was circa 60% lower) and next to reduce TER (30%
lower). The ﬁre also changed ecosystem carbon pools by
reducing carbon in the forest ﬂoor and living biomass
and increasing carbon in WD. Carbon ﬂux from above-
ground WD via decomposition was greater at the

burned site than at the unburned site, but both were a
small fraction (o16%) of TER. The TER was lower at all
soil temperatures at the burned site than at the un-
burned site, even when SWC was similar, consistent
with other reports for conifer forests disturbed by
severe ﬁre (Kowalski et al., 2004).
The regional climate of the study sites explains part of
the slow ecosystem recovery from ﬁre. Cold winters,
dry springs, and low and irregular precipitation limit
GPP, while the wet, warm summer is often more favor-
able for carbon losses than for carbon uptake. The
burned site was a carbon source to the atmosphere in
all months. The severity of the ﬁre, where all trees were
killed and most of the forest ﬂoor consumed, also had
an important role in slowing ecosystem recovery. High-
intensity, stand-replacing ﬁres, such as the one we
studied, are a consequence of management polices of
the past centuries (Covington et al., 1994), and, because
of climate changes, are expected to become more com-
mon in the future (Brown et al., 2004; Westerling et al.,
2006).
Environmental variables secondary to light intensity
and temperature, such as SWC, VPD, and soil tempera-
ture at different depths, exhibited a control that was
seasonally variable and stronger on daytime NEE than
night-time TER, and stronger for the unburned than for
the burned site. In addition, cloudy conditions were
more favorable for carbon uptake than clear sky condi-
tions at both sites, likely because of more favorable
environment conditions for photosynthesis on cloudy
days.
Stand-replacing ﬁre had a strong and persistent effect
on NEE in ponderosa pine forests of northern Arizona.
It is unlikely that the burned site will shift from being a
carbon source to being a carbon sink in the immediate
future due to slow vegetation recovery after ﬁre.
Persistent effects of severe ﬁre must be included to
accurately quantify the carbon balance of ponderosa
pine forests in the southwestern United States, and,
in general, in large-scale and long-term biome produc-
tivity assessments.
