Warm/dry mixed conifer forests have undergone changes in disturbance regimes, forest structure, species
composition, and surface fuel accumulation which have led to increased susceptibility to large, un-
characteristically severe wildﬁres and pathogenic outbreaks. Ecosystems resilient to ﬁre events return to a si-
milar set of structures (e.g., forest and understory composition and density) or processes (e.g., ﬁre, decom-
position rates); however, when exposed to disturbances outside the evolutionary envelope, may transition to a
diﬀerent state (e.g., type conversion). We sampled warm/dry mixed conifer forest stands treated prior to the
2011 Wallow Fire and paired untreated sites ﬁve years following the ﬁre. Our objective was to evaluate mid-term
ecosystem resiliency in terms of forest structure, bark beetle activity, and tree regeneration. We hypothesized
that treated units would have higher mid-term post-ﬁre resiliency compared to untreated units. In 2016, average
total tree density remained signiﬁcantly lower in treated compared to paired untreated units; conifer density and
BA decreased in both treated and untreated units. Diameter distributions in 2016 treated units remained similar
to those observed in 2012 with the exception of increased density in the smallest diameter class. In untreated
units, the majority of tree density reductions occurred in the 10–30 cm dbh classes. Post-ﬁre tree mortality was
stable across treated and untreated units, with no signiﬁcant diﬀerences; however, abundant ingrowth of small
hardwoods occurred throughout the study area. Large-tree density decreased by about 20% in both treated and
untreated units between 2012 and 2016. Evidence of post-ﬁre bark beetles was generally low and patchy
throughout the study site; however, beetle activity was more widespread in untreated units. Twice as many trees
were attacked by bark beetles in untreated versus treated units suggesting treatments may have reduced post-ﬁre
beetle activity. Following wildﬁre, observed conifer regeneration was lower and hardwood regeneration was
higher with increasing burn severity; conifer regeneration was nearly three times higher in treated units. This
study suggests that pre-ﬁre fuel reduction treatments contribute less to mid-term resiliency than to short-term
resiliency of forested ecosystems. We observed trends of higher resilience to insect outbreaks and potential
implications for type change from conifer to deciduous forest. Furthermore, our study underscores the im-
portance of understanding mid-term post-ﬁre recovery, and while it provides insights regarding recovery of these
ecosystems, additional monitoring and research is needed to fully understand the implications toward long-term
resiliency.
1. Introduction
Larger ﬁres, burning with higher severity (i.e., overstory loss), are
occurring
with
increasing
frequency
in
frequent-ﬁre
ecosystems
throughout the world (Westerling et al., 2006; Climate Central, 2012;
Attiwill and Binkley, 2013). Additionally, these larger, landscape-scale
ﬁres can result in contiguous, high-severity patches across larger areas
than historically observed in these ecosystems (Pausas et al., 2008;
Dennison et al., 2014). Ecosystems resilient to ﬁre events return to a
similar set of structures (e.g., forest and understory composition and
density) or processes (e.g., ﬁre, decomposition rates) (Holling, 1973);
however, when exposed to disturbances outside the evolutionary

T

envelope, may transition to a diﬀerent state (e.g., type conversion). For
example, uncharacteristically severe ﬁre events in frequent-ﬁre forests
may result in an ecosystem transition from forests to grass-shrub
communities (Beisner et al., 2003; Bowman et al., 2013; Stephens et al.,
2013).
In the western U.S., warm/dry mixed conifer forests have under-
gone changes in disturbance regimes, forest structure, species compo-
sition, and surface fuel accumulation due to more than a century of ﬁre
exclusion and resource extraction (Fulé et al., 2009; Lydersen et al.,
2013; Reynolds et al., 2013). These changes have increased ecosystem
susceptibility
to
drought
(Negrón
et
al.,
2009),
large,
un-
characteristically severe ﬁres (Stephens and Collins, 2004; Beaty and
Taylor, 2008), and bark beetle attacks (McHugh et al., 2003; Hood and
Bentz, 2007; Negrón et al., 2016). Recent landscape-scale ﬁres (e.g.,
Rodeo-Chediski Fire [2002], Hayman Fire [2002], Rim Fire [2013])
have burned large landscapes with large, contiguous patches within
warm/dry mixed conifer forest ecosystems. These ﬁres have had ad-
verse eﬀects to ecological and human communities (Strom and Fulé,
2007; Graham, 2003; Lydersen et al., 2014). For example, the Wallow
Fire, the largest ﬁre recorded in Arizona, burned a total of 217,741 ha
(538,050 ac) in Arizona and New Mexico during the summer of 2011
(Wadleigh, 2011), destroying 32 residences and sending a sustained
smoke
plume
causing
potential
health
impacts > 1500 km
away
(Weinhold, 2011).
Uncharacteristic disturbance events can also lead to increases in
other
disturbance
agents,
such
as
bark
beetles
(Coleoptera:
Curculionidae, Scolytinae). For example, trees damaged, but not killed
by ﬁres, become more susceptible to bark beetle attacks resulting in
additional tree mortality in stands impacted by ﬁre (Rasmussen et al.,
1996; Hood and Bentz, 2007; Lerch et al., 2016). The likelihood of
beetle attacks and mortality has been correlated with various burn se-
verity metrics including bole char height, crown damage, cambium
injury, and diameter at breast height (dbh) (McHugh et al., 2003;
Negrón et al., 2016), sometimes in a nonlinear fashion (Hood and
Bentz, 2007).
To mitigate for high ﬁre risk on federally-managed western forests,
fuel reduction treatments including tree thinning and prescribed ﬁre are
implemented, but most often placed adjacent to high-value areas, such
as communities and infrastructure. These locations provide anchor
points for suppression activities, point protection for resources and
values at risk, and can be eﬀective at reducing ﬁre severity and re-
sulting post-ﬁre damage (Pollet and Omi, 2002; Martinson and Omi,
2013). Pre-ﬁre thinning treatments have been shown to reduce ﬁre
severity during wildﬁres (Waltz et al., 2014) and reduce beetle-caused
mortality after prescribed ﬁres (Fettig et al., 2010). In addition to re-
ducing ﬁre-injured trees, which could limit bark beetle-caused mor-
tality, thinning has long been recognized as a method for increasing
stand and individual tree resistance to beetle attacks because it reduces
inter-tree competition, increases tree defense characteristics, and may
change structural and olfactory characteristics, including inﬂuencing
pheromone plume dispersal (Thistle et al., 2004), that beetles use for
locating hosts and conspeciﬁcs (Bartos and Amman, 1989; Amman and
Logan, 1998; Kolb et al., 1998; Fettig et al., 2007).
We examine the trajectory of frequent-ﬁre forest responses to a large
landscape ﬁre, building oﬀa one-year post-ﬁre study (Waltz et al. 2014)
that
examined
short-term
metrics
of
forest
resiliency
to
un-
characteristically severe wildﬁre. Using large-tree mortality, high-se-
verity patch size, and burn severity (measured by tree mortality), they
concluded that stands that had forest thinning treatments implemented
prior to the wildﬁre had higher resiliency than untreated stands. Waltz
et al., (2014) found treated areas had lower large-tree mortality,
smaller high-severity patch sizes, and overall lower ﬁre severity com-
pared with adjacent untreated stands and recommended additional
mid- and long-term assessments of metrics associated with resiliency
were necessary to fully understand fuel reduction treatment eﬀects on
resiliency. In particular, the type changes predicted and observed from
uncharacteristically severe events (Savage and Mast, 2005; Roccaforte
et al., 2012; Buma et al., 2013) can only be assessed with regeneration
studies through time. Understory responses, including invasive plant
establishment or growth, also require years to decades to properly as-
sess. Stand structure conditions one year following wildﬁre may have
antecedent inﬂuence over observed recovery, especially in the case of
ﬁre-caused delayed tree mortality. Finally, little is known about the
eﬀects of fuel reduction treatments on beetle-caused tree mortality after
wildﬁres.
Our objective in this study was to evaluate forest structure, bark
beetle activity, and tree regeneration in terms of mid-term ecosystem
resiliency and, with respect to the observed conditions ﬁve years fol-
lowing the Wallow Fire, to address the study constraints identiﬁed by
Waltz et al. (2014). We re-examined the hypothesis that wildﬁre hazard
reduction treatments increase ecological resiliency with respect to de-
layed large-tree mortality, bark beetle activity, and regeneration den-
sity and composition. We revisited the same study sites and used the
same experimental design established in 2012 that paired areas that
had fuels reduction treatments implemented prior to the ﬁre with
nearby untreated areas. Our speciﬁc questions in the warm/dry mixed
conifer post-ﬁre landscape were: (1) Do forest structure and post-ﬁre
delayed large-tree mortality diﬀer among treated and untreated units?
(2) Does bark beetle activity diﬀer among treated and untreated units?
and, (3) Does overstory regeneration density and composition diﬀer
among treated and untreated units?
2. Methods
2.1. Study area
We relocated study sites in the Wallow Fire footprint on the Apache-
Sitgreaves National Forests in east-central Arizona near the commu-
nities of Greer, Alpine, and Nutrioso. We examined warm/dry mixed
conifer forest ecosystems where multiple wildland-urban interface
(WUI) fuels reduction treatments occurred prior to the Wallow Fire
(Waltz et al., 2014). Elevation ranged between 2469 and 2838 m and
slopes were < 45%. Overstory tree species present included: ponderosa
pine (Pinus ponderosa), Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii), white ﬁr
(Abies concolor), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), southwestern
white pine (Pinus strobiformis), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides),
Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), New Mexico locust (Robinia neomex-
icana), and alligator juniper (Juniperus deppeana). The Wallow Fire
burned 217,741 ha in east-central Arizona and west-central New
Mexico between May 29 and July 8, 2011 (National Interagency Fire
Center,
https://www.nifc.gov/ﬁreInfo/ﬁreInfo_stats_lgFires.html,
ac-
cessed 14 February 2018). Our study sites were located in the northern
extent of the ﬁre and burned from June 4–9, 2011; the ﬁre burned
16,250–30,850 ha each of these days (Waltz et al. 2014). The two
closest Remote Automated Weather Stations (RAWS http://www.raws.
dri.edu) near Alpine and Greer, AZ recorded maximum air temperatures
during this time period between 23.3 and 26.7 °C, daily minimum re-
lative
humidity
of
5–15%,
and
maximum
wind
speeds
of
38.5–67.7 km h−1 out of the south-southwest (Western Regional Cli-
mate Center, www.wrcc.dri.edu, accessed 3 May 2017; Waltz et al.
2014). Average total annual precipitation was 399 mm from 2001 to
2011. Total precipitation in 2011, the year of the Wallow Fire, was 90%
of the pre-ﬁre decadal average. Total annual precipitation at Alpine, AZ
averaged 476 mm between 2012 and 2016. Most precipitation in the
study area occurs in winter and during summer monsoon storms.
2.2. Experimental design
We replicated the same study design previously implemented in
2012 and described in detail in Waltz et al. (2014). In summary, we
utilized a quasi-experimental design (Shadish et al., 2002) by re-
measuring nine pairs of treated/untreated study units. We selected

treated units based on the following criteria: (1) warm/dry mixed
conifer forest type; (2) treated within the 10 years prior to the Wallow
Fire; (3) minimum area of 12 ha; (4) burned during the Wallow Fire. We
used a paired-plot design where each treated unit was paired with a
nearby untreated unit that had similar topography and burned within
the same 24-h period. Treated units included areas that were me-
chanically thinned followed by either prescribed burning or mechanical
residual fuel removal. We revisited 179 of 180 plots (18 units × 10
randomly selected plots = 180 plots; one treated plot could not be re-
located in 2016) that were initially sampled in 2012.
We examined delayed large-tree mortality and forest structure at-
tributes (density and basal area [BA]) ﬁve years following the Wallow
Fire compared to the one-year post-ﬁre observations (Waltz et al.,
2014). We suggest mid-term metrics of resiliency to assess if fuels re-
duction treatments increased resiliency to uncharacteristically severe
ﬁre including delayed large-tree mortality, bark beetle activity, and
regeneration.
2.3. Field methods and statistical analysis
Plots were remeasured between 8 July and 22 August 2016, ﬁve
years following the Wallow Fire. We recorded species, condition (living
or snag/log classes from Thomas et al., 1979), and presence of and
mortality from bark beetle attacks (assessed by presence and abundance
of pitch tubes, exit holes, and or frass), and measured diameter at breast
height (dbh) for all overstory trees taller than 137 cm within each 400-
m2 ﬁxed-area sampling plot. We tallied tree regeneration (trees < 137
cm in height) and woody shrubs within a 100-m2 subplot nested within
each overstory plot and recorded species and condition for each stem.
We performed statistical analyses for forest structure, large-tree
mortality, bark beetle activity, and regeneration at the treatment unit
level using matched pairs in Wilcoxon signed-rank tests using JMP® Pro
software (v. 13.0.0, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC 1989–2017). We ﬁt
zero-inﬂated Poisson and zero-inﬂated negative binomial generalized
linear mixed-eﬀects models using the glmmTMB package (Brooks et al.,
2017) in R (v 3.4.3, R Core Team, 2017) for each of the response
variables (conifer and hardwood regeneration counts) as a function of
percent observed overstory mortality in 2012 and treatment (treated vs
untreated). We used α = 0.05 for all analyses.
3. Results
3.1. Forest structure and delayed large-tree mortality
In 2016, average live tree density remained signiﬁcantly lower
(P = 0.0117) in areas where fuels reduction treatments were im-
plemented prior to the Wallow ﬁre (110 trees ha−1) compared to paired
untreated units (271 trees ha−1) (Table 1). In treated units, total live
tree density increased by 27 trees ha−1 (33%) between 2012 and 2016,
while in untreated units, density decreased by 20 trees ha−1 (−7%).
However, the increase in treated units was exclusively due to post-ﬁre
ingrowth of aspen saplings (254% increase). Conifer density and BA
decreased in both treated and untreated units. Density decreases were
dominated by a net loss of ponderosa pine in treated (−8 trees ha−1;
−1 m2 ha−1) and untreated (−42 trees ha−1; −2 m2 ha−1) units and
showed a statistically insigniﬁcant trend towards higher net losses in
untreated stands (−41% in untreated vs. −24% in treated). Diameter
distributions in 2016 treated units remained similar to those observed
in 2012 with the exception of the smallest diameter class (2.5–10 cm)
which increased by 654% from 7 to 55 trees ha−1 (Fig. 1). In untreated
units, the majority of tree density reductions between 2012 and 2016
occurred in the 10–30 cm dbh classes; both treated and untreated stands
showed minimal decreases in the larger diameter tree classes. For large
trees (conifers ≥37.5 cm dbh; hardwoods ≥20 cm dbh) alive in 2012,
density decreased by 9 trees ha−1, or −21% (range: −25% to 0%), and
BA decreased by 1 m2 ha−1, or −16% (range: −23% to 0%), between
2012 and 2016 in treated units; large-tree density decreased by 8 trees
ha−1, or −18% (range: −42% to 0%), and BA decreased by 1 m2 ha−1,
or −20% (range: −41% to 0%), between 2012 and 2016 in untreated
units (Fig. 2).

pitch tubes with frass for ponderosa pine, southwestern white pine, and
spruce; or widespread frass for Douglas-ﬁr and white ﬁr) and un-
successful (few pitch tubes and little to no frass), was generally low and
patchy throughout the study site. About 9% (118 out of 1365) of trees
alive in 2016 were attacked by bark beetles throughout the study area;
however, activity was more widespread in untreated units (15% of
treated plots vs. 69% of untreated plots had at least one attacked tree).
Stands treated prior to the Wallow Fire had a lower percentage of trees
attacked than untreated stands (7.4% ± 2.7% for treated units;
15.3% ± 4.8% for untreated units) but the diﬀerence was not sig-
niﬁcant (Fig. 3; P = 0.26). Of those trees that were attacked, about half
were killed in both treated and untreated stands as a result of bark
beetle attacks. All trees that were attacked in treated units were large
(> 37.5 cm dbh) ponderosa pines (92%) with the exception of one large
white ﬁr. In untreated units, ponderosa pine (80% of total recorded
attacks) and Douglas-ﬁr (12% of recorded attacks) were the two pre-
dominant species with beetle attacks; attacked trees had an average dbh
of 30 cm.
3.3. Regeneration density and composition
Regeneration was abundant in 2016 and occurred on > 75% of the
plots in both treated and untreated units. Regeneration and shrub
density were highly variable and showed no statistically signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between treated and untreated units (Table 2). Conifer re-
generation density was nearly three times greater in treated units
compared to those that were untreated prior to the Wallow Fire.
Hardwood species (aspen, oak, and locust) dominated the regeneration
sampling, and comprised 86% of stem density in treated units and 94%
in untreated units. Shrub density in untreated stands was nearly double
that of treated stands, albeit statistically insigniﬁcant.
Based on ﬁeld observations in 2016 and observations of high-se-
verity patches in both treated and untreated units reported by Waltz
et al. (2014), the relationship of conifer and hardwood regeneration
responses with post-ﬁre (2012) overstory mortality was also assessed
(Fig. 4). Waltz et al. (2014) reported high-severity patches in treated
stands, although signiﬁcantly smaller than high-severity patches in
untreated stands. Zero-inﬂated negative binomial generalized linear
mixed eﬀects models conﬁrmed no diﬀerences between treated and
untreated stands with respect to conifer regeneration but a signiﬁcant
treatment eﬀect was observed for hardwood regeneration. Residuals
exhibited a small amount of skewedness (i.e., the median was not zero)
and low corresponding overdispersion parameters (1.17 for conifers
and 0.902 for hardwoods) suggest the data were not overdispersed.
(Fig. 4). Regression coeﬃcients (i.e., expected log count for one-unit
increases in predictor variables) for percent overstory mortality were
−1.21 (P = 0.004) and 1.12 (P = 0.002) for conifer and hardwood
regeneration, respectively. Untreated units (as compared to treated)
exhibited a negative relationship with both conifer and hardwood re-
generation counts and while signiﬁcant for hardwood regeneration
(coef. −0.56; P = 0.013), conifer regeneration relationship to treat-
ment was not statistically signiﬁcant (coef. −0.35; P = 0.186).

4. Discussion
We assessed forest responses to uncharacteristically severe wildﬁre
ﬁve years following the Wallow Fire. Comparisons with a one-year post-
ﬁre assessment allowed us to examine the trajectory of response for
treated (thinned and burned) and untreated stands. Although short-
term metrics of resiliency, deﬁned by Waltz et al. (2014), suggested
thinned units showed higher resiliency to the Wallow Fire, longer-term
studies are needed to assess the persistence of this pattern. We hy-
pothesized resilient forests would show (1) lower delayed large-tree
mortality from wildﬁre; (2) lower attack and/or mortality from asso-
ciated disturbance agents (e.g., bark beetles); and (3) regeneration
density and composition similar to the pre-ﬁre overstory composition.
Delayed tree mortality occurred in both treated and untreated
stands; however, there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in response, sug-
gesting little diﬀerence in resiliency of treated and untreated stands
with regard to ongoing tree mortality following high-severity ﬁre. In
treated stands, overall tree density increased due to fast-growing
hardwood recruitment into the overstory. When examining delayed tree
mortality, diﬀerences were diﬃcult to evaluate because 2016 total tree
density was not independent of fast-growing regeneration. Hardwoods
also had a large inﬂuence on the regeneration results.
Bark beetle attack rates showed trends of higher attacks in untreated
stands; however, these were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. Aerial surveys con-
ducted by the U.S. Forest Service, reported high levels of bark beetle activity
within the perimeter of the Wallow Fire in the years following the ﬁre (USDA,
2017). Thus, we expected to observe high levels of beetle activity within our
study units. In contrast to our expectations, evidence of beetle activity was
low throughout our study sites; however, beetle activity was more wide-
spread in untreated units. Although not statistically signiﬁcant, the percent of
residual tree density attacked by bark beetles in untreated units (15.3%) was
twice as high as in treated stands (7.4%), suggesting that pre-ﬁre thinning
treatments may reduce beetle activity in stands burned by wildﬁres. Once a
tree was attacked, mortality was about 50% for both treated and untreated
stands; however, this does not mean that tree vigor/resistance was not in-
creased by the thinning treatments. We did not examine bark beetle attack
density and it is possible that it took a higher density of beetles to kill trees in
treated versus untreated areas. Ponderosa pine was by far the most heavily
attacked tree species in our study, which is likely due in part to its dominance
in the studied stands (65% of all residual conifers in treated units and 52% of
all residual conifers in untreated units), but is also consistent with previous
research showing that bark beetles favor ﬁre-injured ponderosa pine trees
(McHugh et al., 2003; Wallin et al., 2003; Breece et al., 2008). Although we
did not examine galleries in this study, ponderosa pines are generally at-
tacked by a combination of beetle species in both the Ips and Dendroctonus
genera in dry forests of Arizona, often with multiple species occurring in the
same tree (Breece et al., 2008). There are no published reports of mountain
pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) as a signiﬁcant contributor to mortality
of ponderosa pine in eastern Arizona; however, mountain pine beetle has
been documented as causing mortality in southwestern white pine following
the Wallow Fire (USDA, 2013). Similarly, ﬁr engraver (Scolytus ventralis Le-
Conte) and Douglas-ﬁr beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopkins) have
shown a preference for attacking ﬁre-injured trees (Schmitz and Gibson,
1996; McMillin and Allen, 2003; Hood and Bentz, 2007; USDA, 2013).
Douglas-ﬁr, the second-most abundant conifer in our study (21% of all re-
sidual conifers in treated units and 32% in untreated units), was the second-
most attacked tree in untreated stands but no Douglas-ﬁrs were attacked in
treated stands.

Total regeneration of overstory trees showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerences
among treated and untreated stands for conifer species and a signiﬁcant
negative eﬀect for hardwoods in untreated stands, oﬀering a nuanced view
of post-ﬁre recovery where the response of hardwood regeneration fol-
lowing ﬁre may increase in areas that receive treatments prior to un-
characteristically severe wildﬁres. Additionally, there were compositional
diﬀerences signiﬁcantly related to severity of the ﬁre, based on overstory
mortality. High-severity areas showed higher regeneration of hardwoods,
which resprout and can quickly respond to large openings in canopies.
Alternatively, conifer species (dominant in the pre-ﬁre overstory) re-
generate by seed and require a local seed source.
For example, Barton (2002) showed that intense crown ﬁres in the
Chiricahua mountains of southeastern Arizona drastically changed
community structure and composition, resulting in heterogeneous pine-
oak forests, dominated by Apache pine (Pinus engelmannii) and Chi-
huahua pine (Pinus leiophylla) being converted into homogeneous oak
woodlands dominated by sprouting hardwoods. Similar conditions were
observed by Savage and Mast (2005) in northern Arizona ponderosa
pine forests following crown ﬁres in the late 1940s to the mid-1970s,
where their results suggest that these systems were non-resilient and
thus have been largely converted to grass-shrub communities. Fur-
thermore, Strom and Fulé (2007) and Tarancón et al. (2014) suggest
distinctly diﬀerent trajectories, where simulations without treatments
resulted in type conversion or extreme forest loss and simulation of
fuels reduction and/or restoration treatments resulted in increased
sustainability of native forest in the face of severe wildﬁres and pro-
jected climate change. Most recently, Owen et al. (2017) reported si-
milar, yet highly variable, results in ponderosa pine and sprouting
hardwood regeneration patterns following the 2000 Pumpkin and 2002
Rodeo-Chediski Fires (13 years post-ﬁre) and suggest that ponderosa
pines are re-establishing at low densities in heterogeneous spatial pat-
terns within large, high-severity patches. However, it is important to
note that our mean ﬁve-year post-ﬁre conifer regeneration densities
were 2–5 times higher than the upper end of their reported range
13 years post-ﬁre. In short, our results varied and support these and
other ﬁndings regarding post-ﬁre recovery (e.g., Haire and McGarigal,
2010) and provide another nuanced view, in which the degree of
conversion from pine-dominated forest to sprouting hardwood shrub-
lands or woodlands is heavily inﬂuenced by pre-ﬁre conditions, se-
verity, and time since ﬁre.
4.1. Conclusions and management implications
This study evaluated forest structure, bark beetle activity, and tree
regeneration dynamics in terms of ecosystem resiliency based on ob-
served conditions ﬁve years following the Wallow Fire to address the
identiﬁed study constraints in the Waltz et al. (2014) “metrics of re-
siliency” study. Waltz et al., (2014) state that treatments that aid pro-
tection of human values and resources will always be ﬁrst priority for
federal land managers in the western U.S.; however, in frequent-ﬁre
systems, these treatments also add ecological resilience to these eco-
systems. Our study suggests that pre-ﬁre fuel reduction treatments
contribute less to mid-term resiliency than to short-term resiliency
(Waltz et al., 2014) of forested ecosystems. We observed trends of
higher resilience to insect outbreaks and potential implications for type
change from conifer to deciduous forest. Furthermore, this study un-
derscores the importance of understanding post-ﬁre recovery in the
mid-term, and while it provides some insights regarding recovery of
these ecosystems, additional monitoring and research is needed to fully
understand the implications toward long-term resiliency.
