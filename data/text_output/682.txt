1. Introduction
The diversity and abundance of native understory vegetation is
an important measure of ecological integrity in ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa) forests. Over the past century, ﬁre suppression,
overgrazing, and poor logging practices have led to increased
overstory density and reduced understory species abundance (i.e.,
aerial cover) and diversity (Bakker and Moore, 2007). The loss of
species from a community can alter ecosystem functions, such as
plant productivity, nutrient cycling, and trophic linkages, and may
reduce community resistance to nonnative species invasion (Elton,
1958; Hooper and Vitousek, 1997; Tilman et al., 1997; McCann,
2000). Thus, a major management goal in these low-diversity
forests is to restore the native diversity and abundance of
herbaceous understory communities while simultaneously miti-
gating nonnative species establishment and spread. In this paper
we evaluate whether reducing overstory biomass and canopy
cover and reintroducing surface ﬁres can achieve these goals.
Restoration treatments of tree removal and prescribed ﬁre are
ecological disturbances. Tree harvesting machinery and personnel
often perturb the soil during thinning procedures and prescribed
ﬁre removes much of the understory aboveground biomass. While
the disturbances are produced with the intention of enhancing the
native vegetative community, undesired and detrimental non-
native species can also respond quickly to disturbance (Hobbs and
Huenneke, 1992; Crawford et al., 2001; Grifﬁs et al., 2001; Allen
et al., 2002). Nonnative species have been shown to increase in
coniferous forests treated with prescribed ﬁre, particularly when
coupled with tree thinning (Wienk et al., 2004; Fule´ et al., 2005;
Huisinga et al., 2005; Dodson and Fiedler, 2006; Youngblood et al.,
2006; Collins et al., 2007). The risk of spread of nonnatives is a
major concern and usually contrary to the goals of ecological
restoration (Moore et al., 1999; Allen et al., 2002; D’Antonio and
Meyerson, 2002).

An important goal of forest restoration is to increase native plant diversity and abundance. Thinning and
burning treatments are a common method of reducing ﬁre risk while simultaneously promoting
understory production in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests. In this study we examine the
magnitude and direction of understory plant community recovery after thinning and burning restoration
treatments in a ponderosa pine forest. Our objective was to determine if the post-treatment community
was a diverse, abundant, and persistent assemblage of native species or if ecological restoration
treatments resulted in nonnative species invasion. This project was initiated at the Grand Canyon-
Parashant National Monument, Arizona, USA in 1997. We established four replicated blocks that
spanned a gradient of soil types. Each block contained a control and a treated unit. Treated units were
thinned to emulate pre-1870 forest stand conditions and prescribed-burned to reintroduce ﬁre to a
system that has not burned since 1870. We measured plant cover using the point-line intercept
method and recorded species richness and composition on 0.05 ha belt transects. We examined the
magnitude of treatment responses using Cohen’s d effect size analysis. Changes in community
composition were analyzed using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS). Native plant species cover
and richness increased in the thinned and burned areas compared to the controls. By the last year of the
study, annual species comprised nearly 60% of the understory cover in the treatment units. Cheatgrass
(Bromus tectorum), a nonnative annual grass, spread into large areas of the treated units and became the
dominant understory species on the study site. The ecological restoration treatments did promote a
more diverse and abundant understory community in ponderosa pine forests. The disturbances
generated by such treatments also promoted an invasion by an undesirable nonnative species. Our
results demonstrate the need to minimize disturbances generated by restoration treatments and argue
for the need to proactively facilitate the recovery of native species after treatment.

To examine the response of ponderosa pine forests to thinning
and burning restoration treatments, we established several stand-
scale (32 ha) experimental blocks at the Mt. Trumbull restoration
site in the Uinkaret Mountains of northern Arizona. This site was
determined to be a useful choice for ecological restoration due to a
high crown-ﬁre risk compared to pre-1870 conditions (Roccaforte
et al., 2008). Additionally, understory plant species diversity and
abundance was lower than regional pine-oak forests (see Laughlin
et al., 2005 for an example of a more diverse and abundant
understory community in a pine-oak forest). At the onset of the
project, Mt. Trumbull supported a dense ponderosa pine—Gambel
oak (Quercus gambelii) forest (1370 trees taller than 1.37 m ha1),
with a thick litter and duff layer (2–5 cm depth; Waltz et al., 2003).
The overall objective of this project was to reduce the risk of crown
ﬁre and increase native understory abundance and species
diversity (see Waltz et al., 2003 for a description of treatment
protocols and overstory response to restoration treatments).
Understory recovery following thinning and burning treat-
ments on Mt. Trumbull was potentially compromised by an
impoverished native seed bank and the presence of several species
of invasive nonnative plants, particularly cheatgrass (Bromus
tectorum) (Springer, 1999). Cheatgrass has severely invaded the
Mojave and Great Basin deserts including portions of southern
Nevada and Utah and northern Arizona. In the western United
States cheatgrass has been highly persistent and disruptive to the
ecosystem (Mack, 1981; Brandt and Rickard, 1994; Knapp, 1996).
Cheatgrass-dominated systems promote frequent, homogeneously
distributed ﬁres (Whisenant, 1990) and usually contain lower
native plant diversity and abundance than comparable native-
dominated areas (Young and Evans, 1978; Mack, 1981). Therefore,
it is possible that cheatgrass could prevent native species
establishment following restoration activities.
There is evidence that native plant community composition can
regulate the invasion potential of an ecosystem. The community-
level factors that determine invasibility are numerous, poorly
understood, and often different from one system to the next.
Biodiversity is often linked to the invasibility of a system, but there
is little agreement as to the function of biodiversity in resisting
invasion. Low-diversity systems have been shown to be at greater
risk of invasion (Elton, 1958; Tilman, 1997; Kennedy et al., 2002),
while other research has shown high-diversity communities to be
more invasible (Stohlgren et al., 2001, 2003). There is increasing
evidence that the presence of mature perennial species is the most
important community factor for limiting the spread of cheatgrass
(Booth et al., 2003; Humphery and Schupp, 2004; Chambers et al.,
2007).
In this study we evaluate the magnitude and direction of
understory vegetation change for the ﬁrst ﬁve years after
restoration treatments. The ecological restoration project at Mt.
Trumbull had two primary objectives concerning the understory
response to thinning and burning treatments: (1) to increase the
abundance and diversity of native understory vegetation; and (2)
promote
a
resilient
plant
community
that
is
resistant
to
encroachment by nonnative species.
2. Methods
2.1. Study site
The study site is located in the Grand Canyon—Parashant
National Monument (GCPNM), located in the Uinkaret Mountain
range of northern Arizona on the north side of the Grand Canyon.
The GCPNM is currently co-managed by the BLM and National Park
Service. We established our research plots in a basin between the
Mt. Trumbull and Mt. Logan Wildernesses (368220N, 113870W), at
an elevation range from 2000 to 2400 m. The soils on Mt. Trumbull
consist primarily of shallow, cindery Inceptisols derived from
basaltic parent materials.
The study area receives an annual average of 415 mm of
precipitation, but there is a high amount of variability from year to
year (Fig. 1). Annual precipitation during the eight years of this
study varied from a high of 660 mm in 2004 to a low of 150 mm in
2002, the driest year recorded in northern Arizona. The majority of
the precipitation occurs as monsoonal rain in the late summer and
snow in winter.
Vegetation on our study site was dominated by ponderosa pine
and Gambel oak. There was a diverse shrub community consisting
primarily of Utah serviceberry (Amelanchier utahensis), wax
currant (Ribes cereum), New Mexican locust (Robinia neomexicana),
and big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata). The main grass species
were bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides), muttongrass (Poa
fendleriana), and western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii). No
native annual grasses have been recorded in our study area. There
was a very diverse community of perennial and annual forbs.
2.2. Block design
We established four experimental blocks, each approximately
32 ha in size, containing two 16-ha treatment units. Within each
block one unit was randomly assigned an ecological restoration
treatment and the other was used as an untreated control. In each
treatment unit, we established 20 permanently marked plots
spaced 60 m apart in a grid pattern. Blocking design was based on
soil type, forest density, forest composition and herbaceous cover.
Listed below is a brief description of each:
Block 1 – Located on a relatively recent lava ﬂow with lava/
cinder soils and some exposed bedrock, this block had low tree
density, consisting almost entirely of ponderosa pine, with
many living presettlement (pre-1870) trees and scattered large
shrubs, primarily Utah serviceberry and wax currant. Soils on
this block were the coarsest of the research units.
Block 2 – This block was located on ﬁne-grained and vesicular
basalt soils and had an abundance of Gambel oak, as well as
New Mexican locust and big sagebrush scattered throughout
the unit. It also had relatively high herbaceous cover.
Block 3 – At the highest elevation, Block 3 was dominated by
large, presettlement ponderosa pine, but Gambel oak and New
Mexican locust were located throughout the unit. The soils
were moderately grained, cindery remnants of an ancient
cinder cone.

precipitation from 1992 to 2007. Arrows denote years of vegetation measurements.

Block 4 – Represented the densest stands of ponderosa pine
forest at Mt. Trumbull. It consisted of dense ponderosa pine
poles (<10 cm), some Gambel oak clumps and some Pinus edulis
and Juniperus osteosperma at its western end. This block was on
ﬁne-grained basalt soils with few living presettlement ponder-
osa pine.
2.3. Restoration treatments
Thinning treatments were designed to recreate a forest
structure consistent with pre-EuroAmerican settlement (pre-
1870) conditions. All live coniferous trees established prior to
1870 and all deciduous trees were retained. Additionally, for every
nonliving remnant (e.g., snags, stumps, stump holes, etc.) of a
conifer that was alive pre-1870, we retained 1.5–3 replacement
trees (e.g., for 10 remnants of pre-1870 trees, 15–30 replacement
trees would be retained). Thinning was conducted in 1999.
Merchantable timber was removed from the site and the slash
was lopped and scattered. The treatment units were burned in
1999 and 2000 (see Waltz et al., 2003 and Fule´ et al., 2007 for
additional details on historical forest reconstruction and the
thinning and burning protocol). Slash was copious across the study
site prior to burning, leading to localized areas of high ﬁre severity
that
experienced
unintended
tree
mortality
and
high
soil
temperatures. Even in high-severity burned areas, tree mortality
was insufﬁcient to reduce tree density below prescription targets.
The study area was not seeded after treatment.
Prior to thinning and burning, total basal area averaged
approximately 35 m2 ha1 in both the control and treatment
units. In 2000, after thinning and burning, basal area had been
reduced to 34.3 and 18.8 m2 ha1 respectively. Additional mor-
tality of trees after 2000 further reduced the basal area to
33.8 m2 ha1 in the control units and 14.7 m2 ha1 in the treated
units (Waltz et al., 2003; Fule´ et al., 2007). The litter and duff layers
were signiﬁcantly reduced after burning (Waltz et al., 2003).
2.4. Sampling design
Sampling protocol for herbaceous and shrub vegetation was
modiﬁed from the National Park Service ﬁre monitoring protocol
(USDI NPS 1992). We used the point-line intercept method to
collect herbaceous and shrub cover data and a belt transect to
collect species richness data on all plots. Each plot contained one
50-m transect running with the dominant slope of the landscape
and centered on the center of each plot. Plants were recorded every
30 cm along the transect for a total of 166 points per plot. Species
presence/absence was also recorded within 5 m to either side of
each transect, forming a 10 m wide belt on each plot. Taxonomic
nomenclature and species nativity were based on the USDA Plants
Database (USDA NRCS, 2009).
Weinitiallycollecteddatain1997and1998,priortothinningand

Species richness, however, was greater in the replacement unit
(initial = 8.5 species/500 m2; replacement = 14.5). For the purposes
ofthisanalysisweareassumingthattheseunitsareinterchangeable.
2.5. Statistical analysis
The low statistical power in this large-scale experiment (n = 4)
hinders our ability to draw real biological inferences with
traditional statistics such as an ANOVA. Furthermore, it would
be difﬁcult to determine if non-signiﬁcant results were due to a
true lack of ecological difference or simply an artifact of the low
sample size. Therefore, we chose to examine the magnitude and
direction of the treatment effects. We calculated treatment effect
sizes
(Nakagawa
and
Cuthill,
2007)
for
several
univariate
understory characteristics and used data reduction (McCune and
Grace, 2002) to explore community-level changes. To overcome
the limitation of the small sample size, we are treating each block
as an individual case study using the 20 subplots as subsamples.
Effect size analysis was developed to combine results from
multiple studies, which is conceptually similar to combining
results from multiple sites or blocks (Gurevitch and Hedges, 1999).
For each variable in the analysis, effect size was calculated using a d
statistic for paired groups with the following equation:
d ¼ m2  m1
spooled
;

m1 is the mean of a control unit, m2 is the mean of a treated unit,
n1 = 20 is the sample size within the control unit, n2 = 20 is the
sample size within the treated unit, s2
1 is the variance within the
control unit and s2
2 is the variance within the treated unit (Hedges,
1981; Cohen, 1988). We calculated the mean d across the four blocks
for each variable in the analysis and determined the 95% conﬁdence
interval (CI) for each mean d statistic (Nakagawa and Cuthill, 2007).
We used the point-line intercept data to determine cover values
by dividing the number of points per line transect intercepting a
species or growth habit with the total possible number of points
(166). Cover values for each plot were averaged across all plots
within a treatment unit for each year’s data. We calculated an
annual d statistic for each treatment unit for total, native and
nonnative species, perennial grass, total annual, native annual and
Bromus tectorum cover. Annual d statistics were averaged across
treatment units within year for a yearly treatment effect d statistic
and its accompanying 95% CI.
We used the belt transect data to determine species richness for
all species (total), natives and nonnatives. The number of species
present on each belt transect in each year was summed. We
averaged species richness across belt transects within each
treatment unit for each year. We then calculated d statistics and
CI’susingthesameprocedureasthecoverdata.Meansandmeasures
of variability were generated using JMP-IN software (version 5.1.2,
SAS Institute, 2004). We calculated all d statistics manually.
Community composition was also derived from the belt transect
data. Each species within each treatment unit was assigned a
number from 0 to 20 based on the number of plots in which the
species was detected on the belt transect. We created a community
composition matrix from the 1998 pre-treatment measurements
and the 2001 and 2005 post-treatment data. The 2000 measure-
ments were taken during the ﬁrst growing season after burning and
the 2002 data were collected during a severe drought. To simplify
the interpretation of the analysis, we excluded those two years.
We
used
nonmetric
multidimensional
scaling
(NMS)
to
examine changes in community composition over time and among
treatments (Clark, 1993). Analyses were conducted using PC-ORD
software (version 5.10, McCune and Mefford, 2006). We ran the
ordination using the Sorenson distance measure, random starting
conﬁgurations, 50 runs with real data, a maximum of 200
iterations per run and a stability criterion of 0.00001. The stress
value of the ﬁnal solution was compared to random solutions using
a Monte Carlo test with 50 randomizations. To reduce noise in the
analysis, we ﬁltered out any species that did not occur on at least
10% of the treatment units (McCune and Grace, 2002).

The relationships between plant species groups and ordination
axes were determined by the main matrix Pearson’s r correlations.
Species with the largest (in absolute value) correlation coefﬁcients
were considered to have the strongest inﬂuence on the axes. To
determine the differences in the rate of change in community
composition between the treatment and controls, we calculated a d
statistic and 95% CI from the Sorenson distance matrix.
Lastly, we used simple linear regression to examine the
relationship between species richness and cheatgrass invasion.
We regressed 2005 cheatgrass cover against both native and total
species richness per plot for each year of the study. All linear
regression analyses were conducted using JMP IN software
(version 5.1.2, SAS Institute, 2004).
3. Results
3.1. Pre-treatment
The
pre-treatment
plant
community
was
not
detectibly
different between the control and thinned and burned units
(Fig. 2). While most cover values were greater in the thinned and
burned areas in 1998, there was high variability among blocks
(Table 1). The 95% conﬁdence intervals for effect sizes overlapped
with zero for all response variables prior to treatment (Fig. 2).
3.2. Plant abundance and diversity
The restoration treatments increased plant community cover
and diversity compared to the controls (Fig. 2). By 2005, total cover
had nearly doubled in the restoration treatment, while remaining
unchanged on control units (Table 1). This trend was consistent for
most plant growth habits we analyzed. While native species
dominated the community immediately after treatment, non-
native species accounted for over 40% of the cover by the end of this
study (Table 1). Additionally, nonnative species cover had an
increasingly positive effect size (Fig. 2). Most of this change was
driven by the large increase in cheatgrass (Table 1). Prior to 2002,
cheatgrass cover remained consistent in both the restored and
control units. There was a sharp reduction in cheatgrass cover in
2002, likely in response to the drought of that year. By 2005,

zero (i.e., no effect) ordinate. The vertical arrow indicates the time of the treatment.

cheatgrass had the greatest cover of any individual species and
most growth habits (Table 1). Additionally, by 2005 cheatgrass
accounted for 90% of the total nonnative cover in the thinned and
burned units and 71% in the control units. Prior to thinning and
burning, cheatgrass was prevalent on the treated unit of block 2
(17.85% cover), but was not detected on any of the other blocks.
Cheatgrass cover in 2005 was the greatest in blocks 2 and 3 (36.5%
and 26.15%, respectively) and lowest in block 1 (0.6%), with
intermediate levels in block 4 (5.85%).
Total species richness increased in both thinned and burned and
control areas, but was greater in the thinned and burned areas.
Richness increased in the thinned and burned areas by an average
of more than 10 species, while the controls only increased by an
average of approximately 4 species (Table 1). Nonnative species
richness in the thinned and burned areas had the largest effect size
(Fig. 2). While the change versus the controls was large, nonnative
species only accounted for a small amount of the total species
richness (Table 1). By 2005, nonnatives only accounted for 15% of
the species found in the thinned and burned units. In the controls,
nonnative species richness increased by an average of less than one
species (Table 1).
Species composition showed a strong directional shift in the
ﬁrst two years after thinning and burning (Fig. 3). While the change
was more pronounced in the thinned and burned plots, there was
also a detectable shift in the controls (d = 1.44; 95% CI = 0.94).
Between 2001 and 2005 the rate of change was slower, but the
directional trends of the community were generally similar. Changes
along the time gradient (Axis 2) were driven by a transition from
predominantly woody species to an annual-dominated community
(Fig. 3, Table 2). Of the ﬁve species with the strongest positive
correlation with the time gradient, four were annuals. The longest-
lived species of this group was the biennial forb Lactuca serriola
(Table 2). Conversely, all of the taxa with the strongest negative
correlation to the time gradient were woody plants, except for the
perennial forb Oenothera caespitosa. A similar relationship was
detected across the blocks, with longer lived species having a greater

While

and

did
increase
in
the
restoration treatments, annuals accounted for more than 50% of
the total cover in the treated areas by the end of this study
(Table 1). Variability in annual species cover was high both within
and among years (Table 1). The 2001 annual species community
was comprised of predominantly native species while in 2005
cheatgrass cover was more than double that of all native annuals.
Although perennial species made up less than half the cover in the
thinned and burned areas, there was less change in the community
composition between 2001 and 2005 as compared to immediately
after thinning and burning. This suggests the rate of change in the
plant community is slowing (Fig. 3).
The linear regression analyses showed poor relationship
between cheatgrass cover and total and native richness. The
strongest relationship we detected was between 2005 cheatgrass
and 2002 native richness (r2 = 0.13). No correlation was strong
enough to suggest a biologically signiﬁcant relationship between
pre-invasion species richness and intensity of cheatgrass invasion.
4. Discussion
While the ecological restoration treatments did promote native
diversity and abundance, enhancement of the understory com-
munity was insufﬁcient to resist invasion by cheatgrass. By 2005,
the thinned and burned areas contained nearly twice as many
species as was observed prior to treatment. Native cover, however,
only increased by 25% in response to thinning and burning, with
the greatest change occurring in the native annual community. In
the sixth growing season after thinning and burning treatments
were completed, cheatgrass cover increased by four-fold over pre-
treatment levels. This suggests that the change was insufﬁcient to
establish a native plant community that could exclude an
aggressive nonnative species. After six post-treatment growing
seasons, a single nonnative species dominated the understory and
native species cover comprised only a little more than half the total
cover.
4.1. Effectiveness of treatments in increasing native cover and
diversity
Previous research has reported much larger changes within the
ﬁrst few years after thinning and burning treatments. Ponderosa
pine restoration projects in northern Arizona observed strong
increases in total biomass, total cover, and perennial grass cover
(Moore and Deiter, 1992; Fule´ et al., 2005; Moore et al., 2006;
Laughlin et al., 2006, 2008). Reduced competition from trees for
light, space and soil resources, as well as the removal of
accumulated litter and duff, should have generated a strong
response in the understory. While species richness nearly doubled
over the course of the study, there were no substantial increases in
cover except for the spread of cheatgrass in 2005.
The lack of native species response may be an artifact of low
precipitation levels in the years immediately prior to and following
thinning and burning (Fig. 1). The four years of below-average
moisture beginning in 1999 culminated in 2002 when the area
received only 150 mm of precipitation, approximately a third of
the annual average. In spite of the drought conditions in 2002,
there was above-average rainfall in early September of that year,
commensurate with the normal germination period of cheatgrass.
From that point forward, there was average or above-average
annual precipitation on Mt. Trumbull, with reliable monsoonal and
fall moisture. This wet period corresponds with the inﬂux of
cheatgrass.
It is important to note that the increase in cheatgrass cover
appears to be additive to the understory community. That is, the
data suggest no native cover was displaced to accommodate the
spread of cheatgrass into the thinned and burned areas (Table 1).
Even with the large increase in cheatgrass cover, native species
cover continued to increase through 2005. It is impossible,
however, to determine how much the native cover might have
increased in the absence of the nonnative invasion.
Richness and diversity responded in a much stronger manner to
the thinning and burning treatments than did native cover.
Increases in richness were almost exclusively driven by native
species (Table 1). Native richness increased the most in the thinned
and burned areas in 2005, the same year we observed the increases
in cheatgrass cover. This suggests that, at least in the short-term,
the cheatgrass invasion has not had a deleterious affect on native
community composition. Interestingly, Fule´ et al. (2005) and our
study both observed increasing species richness in the untreated
controls. We do not have direct evidence for the cause of this
response, though it may be an edge effect from the surrounding
treated areas.
4.2. Can restoration treatments resist nonnative invasion?
The post-treatment native plant community on Mt. Trumbull
was not able to resist encroachment by an aggressive nonnative
species. Although species richness and native cover both increased,
these changes did not promote sufﬁcient biological inertia (sensu
Von Holle et al., 2003) in the system to inhibit the spread of
cheatgrass. The lack of reduction in native species abundance or
richness observed with the invasion suggests the pre-invasion
community was either depauperate in functional diversity or, at
minimum, had an abundance of available habitat in the system. We
do not know if the cheatgrass invasion has saturated the system or
if there are sufﬁcient resources still available for continued
simultaneous increases in both native species and cheatgrass.
Long-term monitoring will be necessary to determine the extent
and persistence of the invasion.
Soil texture played a major role in the post-ﬁre successional
dynamics, with long-lived plants being positively correlated to
coarser soils (Fig. 3). Areas with coarser soils were dominated by
shrubs, with perennial forbs and grasses the main component of
the herbaceous understory. Annuals, including cheatgrass, only
established in areas with ﬁne or moderately grained soils. Since all
of the soils on our study area were well-drained, it is likely that the
coarser soils had insufﬁcient water-holding capacity to support
shallow-rooted annual species, instead favoring deeper-rooted
shrubs and perennial forbs. We do not know if the inability of
cheatgrass to establish on the coarse soil sites was to due to simple
water deﬁciency or the inability of cheatgrass to effectively absorb
soil nutrients, particularly nitrogen, in the absence of adequate soil
moisture. Soil texture, soil water-holding capacity, nitrogen
availability, and nitrogen mineralization are strongly intercon-
nected in semi-arid systems (Austin et al., 2004), and several
studies have shown that water and nitrogen can be simultaneously
limiting factors for cheatgrass establishment and growth (Link
et al., 1995; Beckstead and Augspurger, 2004).
5. Conclusions
Invasion by nonnative plant species is a recurring problem with
thinning and burning based ecological restoration treatments.
Several studies have shown a signiﬁcant treatment response in
nonnative species abundance and/or richness after thinning and
burning projects (Grifﬁs et al., 2001; Wienk et al., 2004; Fule´ et al.,
C.M. McGlone et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 258 (2009) 2638–2646
2643

2005; Dodson and Fiedler, 2006; Moore et al., 2006). Typically,
however, the nonnative species have remained a minor component
in the understory community. This is especially true on thinned
and burned sites that develop a robust perennial grass community
after treatment (Grifﬁs et al., 2001; Moore et al., 2006).
There are several factors that may have led to the inability of the
understory community on Mt. Trumbull to resist invasion by
cheatgrass. Seeding with native species or targeted nonnatives is a
common management practice for bolstering seed banks in
disturbed areas, particularly after ﬁre (Robichaud et al., 2000;
Beyers, 2004). The lack of post-treatment seed application may
have limited the potential for native community recovery. Post-ﬁre
seeding has been shown to mitigate nonnative establishment and
spread (Floyd et al., 2006), but seeding can also elevate the risk of
promoting invasion through contaminated seed mixes (Keeley
et al., 2006). Other thinned and burned areas of Mt. Trumbull were
seeded after treatment and similar patterns of cheatgrass invasion
were observed (McGlone et al., 2009). The high level of disturbance
associated with the thinning and burning treatments may have
compromised the sparse vegetation and seedbank present at the
initiation of the project. Most trees were whole-tree harvested and
the logging machinery often caused substantial soil disturbance.
Additionally, fuel loads were heavy and surface-level ﬁre severity
was high in some areas, potentially leading to ﬁre induced plant
mortality and destruction of the seed bank. Korb et al. (2004)
showed that the heat generated from slash pile burning can
signiﬁcantly deplete the soil seed bank and promote the establish-
ment of nonnative species.
It is unknown if cheatgrass will persist as the dominant species
on Mt. Trumbull. In spite of being an annual, disturbance-loving
species, cheatgrass-dominated communities have shown long-
term persistence in other ecosystems (Brandt and Rickard, 1994).
Forests, however, are considered marginal habitat for cheatgrass,
though the species can invade open, disturbed ponderosa pine
forests (Pierson and Mack, 1990). This has been observed on Mt.
Trumbull, where cheatgrass has been largely absent from areas of
dense forest, but has persisted in forest openings for more than a
decade. As more of the forest is thinned in the on-going restoration
work, more habitat will be susceptible to cheatgrass invasion.
Additionally, disturbances are commonplace on Mt. Trumbull. The
BLM is continuing to use thinning and prescribed burning to
reduce wildﬁre risk. Furthermore, the area is also managed for
cattle grazing and recreational activities such as hunting and
hiking. The aforementioned activities are all common occurrences
on the GCPNM and will continue to generate disturbances and
provide dispersal mechanisms for cheatgrass seeds for the
foreseeable future.
Persistent populations of cheatgrass often shift the invaded
ecosystem into an alternate stable state that is likely irreversible
(Brandt and Rickard, 1994). Reduced plant species diversity,
changes in the community composition of soil biota and altered
soil nutrient content have all been documented in cheatgrass-
dominated ecosystems (Young and Evans, 1978; Mack, 1981;
Knapp, 1996; Evans et al., 2001; Belnap et al., 2005). Since the plant
cover, both native and cheatgrass, in the thinned and burned units
was still increasing by 2005, it is reasonable to assume that the
understory was still responding to the restoration treatments. This
makes it difﬁcult to predict if cheatgrass will persist as the
dominant understory species at Mt. Trumbull or if the native
perennial species will be able to establish at levels sufﬁcient to
reduce cheatgrass to a subordinate in the ecosystem. Continued
monitoring will be necessary to fully assess the inﬂuence of
thinning and burning treatments and cheatgrass invasion on the
vegetative community.
A potentially important factor in the future development of the
understory community on Mt. Trumbull will be the role of ﬁre.
While ﬁre return intervals (FRI) in cheatgrass-dominated systems
are consistent with intervals measured through ﬁre scar analysis
on Mt. Trumbull (3–5 year FRI for cheatgrass (Whisenant, 1990)
and 4–7 years for Mt. Trumbull (Waltz et al., 2003)), the ﬁre
behavior is very different in the two communities. Cheatgrass
communities tend to burn homogeneously across the landscape
(Brooks et al., 2004). Open-canopy ponderosa pine forests with a
native perennial grass dominated understory support a mean-
dering surface ﬁre regime that leaves a mosaic of burned and
unburned areas (Weaver, 1951). The heterogeneous burn dis-
tribution in ponderosa pine forests can leave many shrubs and
perennial herbaceous species unburned through one or more ﬁre
cycles. In the more homogeneously distributed cheatgrass ﬁres,
nearly all plants are burned in every ﬁre. Many of the native species
cannot withstand repeated burning at short time intervals, leading
to high mortality levels. The cumulative impact of cheatgrass-
mediated ﬁre regime changes can promote a positive feedback
cycle that reinforces cheatgrass establishment to the exclusion of
native vegetation (D’Antonio and Vitousek, 1992; Brooks et al.,
2004).
The Mt. Trumbull project exempliﬁes the paradox of ecological
restoration. Disturbance is necessary to shift the ecosystem out of
its undesirable state, but those disturbances also leave the system
vulnerable to invasion by aggressive nonnative species. In several
regards the restoration project achieved its goals. Crown fuels are
lower and canopy connectivity is disrupted, reducing the risk of
large-scale crown ﬁres (Roccaforte et al., 2008). The thinned and
burned areas have greater native species richness and cover, but
these successes are potentially compromised by the spread of
cheatgrass through the treatment units. Long-term dominance by
a nonnative species is contrary to the stated objectives of this
project as well as the general ethic of ecological restoration (SER,
2004). The presence of cheatgrass prior to implementation of
restoration treatments suggested the potential for invasion.
There are many ecological concerns in modern ponderosa pine
forests that have encouraged a sense of urgency for accelerated
implementation of ecological restoration projects, including the
risk of large-scale crown ﬁres and permanent loss of understory
diversity (Covington, 2000; Allen et al., 2002). The increasing risk
of invasion by aggressive nonnative species, however, suggests the
need to temper the ecological disturbances caused by restoration
projects and proactively promote a vigorous native understory.
Based on our observations on Mt. Trumbull we propose three
modiﬁcations to the ecological restoration protocol that was used
during this study. First, managing the tree thinning to reduce soil
disturbances generated by tree harvesting machinery and greater
removal of the slash prior to burning could have generated fewer
opportunities for nonnative species establishment and spread,
while causing less disruption to the extant native ﬂora. The second
recommendation would be to have a greater length of time
between the implementation of tree thinning and the prescribed
burning. This would allow a rest period between disturbance
events during which the remnant native vegetation can recover
from the thinning disturbance, potentially creating a more resilient
perennial understory prior to burning. Lastly, aggressive post-ﬁre
seeding with a highly competitive native perennial grass may
facilitate the establishment of a native community capable of
excluding undesirable nonnative species. An example of viable
native perennial grass is bottlebrush squirreltail, which as a
mature plant has been shown to compete well with cheatgrass
(Booth et al., 2003; Humphery and Schupp, 2004). The utility of
these recommendations is potentially compromised by the added
expense of implementation costs due primarily to increased labor
requirements and logistical challenges associated with greater
slash removal. Additionally, our recommendations would reduce
the speed at which thinning and burning projects could be

completed, creating conﬂicts with the need for rapid reduction of
crown-ﬁre potential in ponderosa pine forests. There is little
scientiﬁc information available regarding threshold levels of
disturbance and native species establishment necessary to resist
nonnative species invasion. Even less is known about how best to
implement thinning and burning projects in a cost-efﬁcient and
timely manner while not exposing the ecosystem to risk of invasion.
