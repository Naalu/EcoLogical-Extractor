Abstract
Overstory tree thinning and prescribed ﬁre are used to restore ecosystem structure and function in ponderosa pine (Pinus
ponderosa Laws.) forests of the southwest but little research has examined constraints on population-level responses of
understory plants. In order to study growth and reproduction of a common shrub species after forest restoration treatments, we
monitored Fendler ceanothus (Ceanothus fendleri Gray) plants from 1999 to 2002 in thinned and unthinned overstory units. To
study effects of tree thinning, we analyzed relationships of overstory stand density (Reineke’s SDI) and current-year branch
length, number of branches, and biomass, and also evaluated the importance of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and Rocky
Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) herbivory (Browsing) as a predictor in linear models. To study effects of prescribed ﬁre, we
examined mortality, seedling emergence, and growth response on experimentally burned and unburned plots. SDI and browsing
were signiﬁcantly and negatively correlated with F. ceanothus current-year branch length, biomass, and leaf area but
relationships were generally weak. Across the 4 years, browsing appeared to be consistently more important than SDI in
explaining variation in growth. Although SDI and browsing were signiﬁcant predictors of growth in years with near normal
precipitation, models failed in drought years. Burning resulted in 17–32% mortality whereas 0–5% of plants died on unburned
plots. Mortality of burned plants was positively related to amount of forest ﬂoor consumed during prescribed ﬁres. One growing
season after ﬁre, surviving burned plants responded by producing long resprouts. Current-year branches were consistently longer
on burned than unburned plants only where plots were protected from large herbivores. Unburned plants had more current-year
branches and greater biomass than burned plants. No seedlings emerged on unburned plots but were found on 44% of burned
plots. A quadratic function represented the relationship between seedling emergence and forest ﬂoor consumption. Our results
suggest that restoration treatments in ponderosa pine forests of northern Arizona can help increase abundance of F. ceanothus but
population responses may be slow, particularly when constrained by ungulate herbivory, ﬁre-related mortality of plants and
dormant seeds, and drought.

1. Introduction
It is well known that tree thinning and opening of
dense overstory canopies alters understory microcli-
mate by increasing light transmission, throughfall
precipitation, and soil temperature. (Anderson et al.,

1969; McLaughlin, 1978; Vales and Bunnell, 1988;
Groot and Carlson, 1996). Reduction of overstory
density can also increase available soil moisture and
nutrients (Covington et al., 1997; Kaye and Hart,
1998). These changes can be beneﬁcial to herbaceous
and woody understory plants and increased commu-
nity production is commonly observed after overstory
thinning (Jameson, 1967; Ffolliott and Clary, 1975;
Uresk and Severson, 1989). Response of understory
communities to changes in overstory density can be
expressed by negative linear or curvilinear functions
(Ffolliott and Clary, 1975). For example, in northern
Arizona ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.)
forests,
forage
production
increased
linearly
as
values
of
Reineke’s stand
density
index (SDI;
Reineke, 1933) decreased below 400–550 (Moore
and Deiter, 1992). At higher SDI values, understory
production responses to variations in stand density
were minimal.
Quantiﬁcation of overstory–understory relation-
ships allows forest managers to predict outcomes of
ecological restoration treatments that use thinning to
reduce overstory densities to levels more like those of
presettlement forests (Covington and Moore, 1994;
Covington et al., 1997; Moore et al., 1999). In some
cases, however, other interactions may be as important
as stand density in constraining understory plant
growth and reproduction. For example, we previously
showed that Fendler ceanothus (Ceanothus fendleri
Gray) not protected from browsing mule deer (Odo-
coileus hemionus) and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus
elaphus) had less than one-fourth the current-year
biomass as protected plants in ponderosa pine
stands that had been thinned as part of an ecological
restoration experiment (Huffman and Moore, 2003).
Additionally, severe drought may override potential
beneﬁts of forest thinning in these semi-arid ecosys-
tems (Fule´ et al., 2002). Finally, seeds of plants with
seedbank strategies often require scariﬁcation or
other cues to initiate germination (Harper, 1977).
For these species, recruitment of new genets into
populations may not occur as a result of overstory
thinning alone.
Prescribed ﬁre is often used with thinning as an
ecological restoration tool in ponderosa pine forests of
the Southwest (Covington et al., 1997; Moore et al.,
1999; Allen et al., 2002). Low-intensity ﬁre can
mineralize accumulated forest ﬂoor litter layers,
release nutrients bound in detritus, reduce heavy fuel
loads, and rejuvenate plant populations by stimulating
sprouting and germination of dormant seeds (Whelan,
1995). Importantly, low-intensity ﬁre was a critical
process that inﬂuenced structure and function of pre-
settlement ponderosa pine forests of the southwest and
returned at mean intervals ranging from 2 to 20 years
(Fule´ et al., 1997). Thus, ﬁre should be reintroduced
when restoration of functional attributes of these
ecosystems is a goal (Kaufmann et al., 1994; Coving-
ton et al., 1999).
Presettlement ﬁres likely burned quickly through
abundant grassy fuels and transferred little heat to soil
systems in southwest ponderosa pine forests. Low fuel
loads, high fuel moistures, high relative humidity, low
daytime temperatures, and low wind speed are needed
to safely reintroduce ﬁre in these forests where it has
been excluded for nearly 130 years (Sackett et al.,
1996; Fule´ et al., 1997). Otherwise, initial ﬁres can
smolder in slash and deep layers of accumulated forest
ﬂoor debris and transfer lethal levels of heat to soils
(Covington and Sackett, 1990; Sackett et al., 1996).
Thus, ﬁre behavior and severity during prescribed
burns are likely to be important determinants of
successional trajectories for understory communities.
Further, easily measured variables predictive of ﬁre
effects on understory species can help land managers
formulate prescriptions that both reduce accumulated
fuels and accomplish ecological objectives related to
vegetation structure and composition.
Our objective in this study was to quantify the
effects of overstory density and prescribed ﬁre on F.
ceanothus, a semi-evergreen, nitrogen-ﬁxing shrub
common in understories of ponderosa pine forests
throughout the southwest, Rocky Mountains, and into
South Dakota (Story, 1974; Conard et al., 1985).
Scattered populations of F. ceanothus provide unders-
tory structural heterogeneity and wildlife habitat, par-
ticularly browse for mule deer and elk (Huffman and
Moore, 2003). Resprouting of F. ceanothus after dis-
turbances such as ﬁre appears to be common (Pearson
et al., 1972; Ffolliott et al., 1977; Vose and White,
1991) although detailed descriptions of vegetative
characteristics and variation of response to ﬁre beha-
vior are presently lacking. Similar to congeneric spe-
cies, its seeds are forcibly ejected from dehiscing
capsules and likely remain in forest ﬂoor seed banks
for years until heat from ﬁre allows germination

(Kearney and Peebles, 1951; Quick and Quick, 1961;
Reed, 1974; Krishnan, 1989). Here we report F. cea-
nothus growth and reproduction under a range of
forest overstory densities and the importance of her-
bivory and drought in constraining response. We also
describe mortality, production, and seedling recruit-
ment on experimentally burned plots one growing
season after burning.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study site
We conducted our study during 1999–2002 on the
Fort Valley Experimental Forest (358160N, 1118410W)
in Coconino County approximately 10 km northwest
of Flagstaff, AZ. Elevation of the study area was
around 2300 m above mean sea level. Aspect of the
site was southerly and the topography was gentle with
average slopes of approximately 5–10%. Soils are
developed on tertiary basalt parent material and are
moderately well drained. Annual precipitation at the
site averages around 52 cm and is typically bimodal in
distribution with July–September rain and December–
March snow. In 1999, precipitation was 96% of the
long-term (51 years) average of 41.3 cm for January–
September (Western Regional Climate Center, 2003).
In 2000, 63% of the long-term average fell in these
months. In 2001, precipitation was 91%, but in 2002
only 54% of the long-term average for January–Sep-
tember occurred. Thus, 1999 and 2001 had near
average precipitation whereas 2000 and 2002 were
droughts.
Forest overstories were comprised of ponderosa
pine and common understory species included the
grasses Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica Vasey),
mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia montana (Nutt.)
A.S. Hitchc.), bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus ely-
moides (Raf.) Swezey) and pine dropseed (Blephar-
oneuron tricholepis (Torr.) Nash); the forbs lupine
(Lupinus spp.), ﬂeabane (Erigeron spp.), buckwheat
(Eriogonum spp.), yarrow (Achillea millifolium L.),
and pussytoes (Antennaria spp.); and shrubs F. cea-
nothus and woods rose (Rosa woodsii Lindl.). No
domestic livestock were present at the study site
and primary large herbivores were mule deer and
Rocky Mountain elk.
2.2. Sampling methods
2.2.1. Experimental design
F. ceanothus patches were located in three forest
units undergoing ecological restoration treatments and
three adjacent untreated (control) units in March 1999.
Forest restoration units were 14–16 ha in size and
were thinned in late winter 1998. Before thinning,
basal area was 34–38 m2/ha and density was 955–
1492 trees/ha for trees greater than 1.37 m in height.
Thinning from below reduced basal area by 35–56%
and left 140–243 trees/ha in scattered groups to emu-
late presettlement spatial structure (Fule´ et al., 2001).
Ten discrete patches of F. ceanothus were found in
each of the forest restoration and control units
(N ¼ 60) and these were used to examine effects of
overstory density on F. ceanothus growth and repro-
duction. Patches were generally no more than 2 m in
area and comprised 1–15 F. ceanothus stems. F. cea-
nothus can expand vegetatively and sprout from
belowground branches and root crowns (Vose and
White, 1987; Huffman, pers. obs.). It is not known
whether patches comprised more than one clone.
Hereafter, we refer to stem populations in these
patches as F. ceanothus ‘‘plants’’. Circular plots
(1 m2) were established at the center of F. ceanothus
patches and metal rebar was used to mark plot centers
for relocation.
We established an additional 50 F. ceanothus plots
in each of the restoration units and used these to study
effects of prescribed ﬁre (N ¼ 150) and interactions
with herbivory on growth and reproduction. Effects of
prescribed ﬁre could only be examined within the
thinned forest units due to extreme fuel hazard in
control units. Forest ﬂoor depth was estimated to the
nearest 0.1 cm at plot center. In restoration units, plots
were randomly assigned to herbivore protection and
experimental burning treatments in a 2  2 factorial
design.
2.2.2. Herbivore protection
Fenced exclosures, 2 m  2 m in area and 1.4 m in
height, were constructed in spring 1999 around plots
selected for herbivore protection. Exclosures were
made of wire fence (5 cm  10 cm mesh) and T-bar
posts. The small size of the fenced area discouraged
deer and elk from jumping over the fencing and large
mammal herbivory was effectively eliminated within

107

exclosures. From 0.6 to 5% of terminal buds on
current-year branches were damaged or removed,
apparently by invertebrates, within exclosures across
the 4 study years.
2.2.3. Experimental burning
In order to burn selected plants, ﬁre lines were
constructed around all F. ceanothus plots in restoration
units. Fire lines were continuous fuel breaks approxi-
mately 25–50 cm in width wherein all vegetation and
forest ﬂoor material was removed exposing the
mineral soil. The area protected by ﬁre lines, and
which encompassed each F. ceanothus plot, was
approximately 4 m2. Additionally, all downed woody
debris larger than 5 cm in diameter was removed from
plots in order to control ﬁre behavior and severity.
F. ceanothus plots were experimentally burned in
April 2000 and May 2001 in coordination with United
States Forest Service’s (USFS) broadcast burning of
the larger forest units. In April 2000, 24 F. ceanothus
plots (12 protected from herbivores, 12 unprotected)
were burned in one of the restoration units (called
overstory unit 3T). Drip-torches ﬁlled with a diesel–
gasoline mixture were used to ignite forest ﬂoor
material around edges of the plots and ﬁres were
allowed to burn until naturally extinguished. Due to
extreme ﬁre danger in spring 2000, burn plans were
cancelled before we could complete our experiments.
We were able to resume experimental burning in May
2001. At this time, 65 additional plots (33 protected
from large herbivores, 32 unprotected) were burned in
the 2 remaining restoration units (called overstory
units 1T and 2T).
Average and maximum ﬂame lengths on plots were
estimated during burning. To assess ﬁre behavior,
forest ﬂoor depth on plots was measured within 2
months of burning following methods used at plot
establishment.
2.2.4. F. ceanothus measurements
Length and number of F. ceanothus stems on plots
were measured in March 1999 (pretreatment). Subse-
quently, F. ceanothus stems were measured annually in
September each year from 1999 to 2002. Stem length,
basal diameter, current-year branch length (estimated
average and longest), and number of current-year
branches were measured. Current-year biomass and
leaf area was estimated from stem length relationships
developed from separate destructive sampling (Huff-
man and Moore, 2003).
F. ceanothus seedling recruitment was assessed
twice per year (July and September) and emerging
seedlings were counted at each plot within the
2 m  2 m areas encompassed by ﬁre lines and herbi-
vore exclosures. Emergent seedlings were identiﬁed
by their small stature (stem diameter < 0:5 mm,
length < 5 cm) and the presence of cotyledons.
Overstory density was measured in 2001 at each
plot using point sampling (Avery and Burkhart, 1983).
Wedge prisms of 4.6 basal area factor (BAF; m2/ha)
were used for tree tallies. All tally trees were measured
for diameter at breast height (1.37 m) and recorded in
4 cm diameter classes.
2.3. Data analyses
Linear regression was used to analyze relationships
between F. ceanothus growth variables and overstory
density and browsing. Signiﬁcance level selected for
regressions was 0.05. F. ceanothus growth variables
analyzed were stem number, current-year branch
length (average and longest), current-year biomass,
and current-year leaf area for each of the 4 years of the
study. Overstory density values were derived using
Reineke’s stand density index (SDI; Reineke, 1933)
and tree diameters from point samples. Browsing
values were calculated as the number of current-year
branches browsed divided by the total number of
current-year branches counted on each plot. Data were
natural log-transformed when examination of residual
plots indicated increasing variance with increasing
estimated values.
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used
to test for effects of prescribed burning within restora-
tion units (no plots were burned in untreated units).
Since signiﬁcant differences in stem number, size, and
current-year biomass and leaf area had developed
between protected and unprotected plots by the time
they were burned (Huffman and Moore, 2003), effects
of burning were analyzed for these two groups sepa-
rately. Further, effects of burning were analyzed sepa-
rately for the 2 burn years (2000 and 2001). To analyze
ﬁre effects in 2000, data from burned and unburned
plots in overstory unit 3T were used. To analyze ﬁre
effects in 2001, data from burned and unburned plots
in overstory units 1T and 2T were used. In ANOVA
108

tests for burn-year 2001 plots, overstory unit was
included as a blocking factor. F. ceanothus response
variables analyzed were stem number, population
change, current-year branch number and length (aver-
age and longest), and current-year biomass. Data were
natural log-transformed when necessary to normalize
data distributions and homogenize variances. Signiﬁ-
cance level for tests was 0.05.
Logistic regression was used to test for relationships
between F. ceanothus mortality (categorical) and
ﬂame length and amount (cm) of forest ﬂoor con-
sumed in burning. Linear regression was used to
analyze the relationship between seedling emergence
and forest ﬂoor consumption.
Seedling establishment was assessed by evaluating:
(1) emergence, deﬁned as the number of ﬁrst-year
seedlings counted on a plot. Such seedlings typically
had cotyledons and one or more true leaves; (2) 1-year
survival, deﬁned as the number of seedlings counted
for emergence divided by the number of seedlings
remaining on the same plot after the next growing
season multiplied by 100 (e.g. (emergence 2000/
remaining 2001)  100); (3) 2-year survival, deﬁned
as the number of seedlings counted for emergence
divided by the number remaining on the same plot
after two growing seasons multiplied by 100 (e.g.
(emergence 2000/remaining 2002)  100). Two-year
survival assessment only applied to plots in the overs-
tory unit (3T) that was burned in 2000.
3. Results
3.1. Overstory density, herbivory, and drought
Values for SDI ranged from 124 to 1754 across all
plots (thinned and control forest units) sampled.
Although SDI contributed signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05)
to models and was negatively related to F. ceanothus
growth, its importance was generally low (b1 
|0.004|) compared to that of browsing (proportion of
current-year stems browsed; b2  |0.018|) (Table 1). In
1999, a year of near normal (96%) precipitation
January–September,
SDI
and
browsing
together
explained 60% of variation in current-year biomass.
Neither SDI nor browsing was signiﬁcantly related to
number of current-year branches in 1999 (Table 1).

January–September), SDI was only signiﬁcantly (P <
0.05) related to current-year biomass and leaf area on
plots. Browsing in 2000 was signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05)
related to all growth variables except the longest
current-year branch length, number of current-year
branches, and current-year leaf area on plots (Table 1).
In 2001, a year of near normal (91%) precipitation,
results were similar to those of 1999 and the full model
generally provided the best predictions of growth. In
2002, a year of extreme drought (54% normal pre-
cipitation January–September), SDI was signiﬁcantly
related to number of current-year branches and cur-
rent-year biomass and leaf area on plots. Browsing
was not signiﬁcantly (P  0.05) related to any growth
variable in 2002.
Values of r2 for growth models were generally
higher in years 1999 and 2001 than in 2000 and
2002. Annual precipitation played a signiﬁcant role
in determining the importance of overstory tree den-
sity and browsing on F. ceanothus growth parameters.
Although only four growing seasons were available to
assess the relationship, a signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) positive
trend was observed between correlation coefﬁcients of
F. ceanothus growth models (current-year branch
length response variable) and percent of average
long-term precipitation for the months January–Sep-
tember (Fig. 1).
3.2. Experimental burning
In general, ﬁre behavior and severity were similar
on plots burned in 2000 and 2001 (Table 2). In 2000,
burning resulted in morality of 17% (4 of the 24
burned) of F. ceanothus plants whereas no plants died
that were not burned in forest unit 3T. In 2001, 32%
(21 of the 65) of the burned plants died whereas 5% of
plants died that were not burned in units 1Tand 2T. For
all burned plots combined, probability of mortality
was signiﬁcantly (P < 0.001) related to amount of
forest ﬂoor consumed (Fig. 2). Probability of plant
death increased dramatically after about 3 cm of forest
ﬂoor consumption and no plants survived on plots
where more than 6 cm of forest ﬂoor was consumed.
Average (13–19 cm) and maximum (91–117 cm)
ﬂame lengths were not signiﬁcantly related to
F. ceanothus mortality.

resprouted from aerial stem bases or belowground
structures within about 60 days from burning. In
general, burning converted F. ceanothus patches from
all-aged stem assemblages to those dominated by ﬁrst-
year sprouts. Where plants survived, burning had
varying effects on subsequent stem production. Burn-
ing did not signiﬁcantly (P  0.05) affect the number
of stems on plots protected from large herbivores.
Mean stem number generally increased on protected
plots regardless of burning. Stem number did not
signiﬁcantly (P  0.05) change on unprotected plots
burned in 2000. However, a signiﬁcant (P < 0.05)
increase in number of stems occurred on unprotected
plots burned in 2001.
Burned plants generally produced longer current-
year branches than unburned plants one growing sea-
son after treatment (Table 3). Current-year branches of
burned plants were mainly sprouts originating from
stem bases or belowground structures. These were long
stems (43 cm) with relatively few lateral shoots. On
unprotected plots burned in 2001, there were no sig-
niﬁcant differences in current-year branch length
between burned and unburned plants (Table 3).
Stems of unburned plants had signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05)
more current-year branches than those of burned plants
one growing season after burning, regardless of herbi-
vore protection (Table 3). More current-year branches
on stems of unburned plants translated to signiﬁcantly
(P < 0.05) greater current-year biomass for plants
burned in 2001 (Table 3). No signiﬁcant difference in
current-year stem biomass was found between burned
and unburned plants for those burned in 2000.
3.3. Seedling establishment
No seedlings emerged on unburned plots in any of
the 4 study years. On plots burned in 2000, seedlings
emerged on nearly half (45.8%) the plots and a mean of
1.0 (S.E. ¼ 0.3) seedlings per plot (2500 seedlings/ha)
occurred. Seedlings were found on 55% of plots burned
in 2001 and emergence averaged 5.1 (S.E. ¼ 1.4)

seedlings per plot (12,750 seedlings/ha). Protection
from large herbivores did not signiﬁcantly (Mann–
Whitney; P  0.05) affect the number of seedlings
per plot for either burn year. Therefore, summaries for
seedling emergence and survival are given for pro-
tected and unprotected plots combined (N ¼ 89).
The number of seedlings emerging on plots was not
signiﬁcantly related to amount of forest ﬂoor con-
sumed. However, a signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) relationship
was found between probability of seedling emergence
on plots (proportion of plots on which seedlings
emerged) and amount of forest ﬂoor consumed in
0.5 cm classes (Fig. 3). The form of the relationship
was quadratic and probability of emergence was the
greatest (45–100%) on plots with moderate (2.5–
6.5 cm) amounts of forest ﬂoor consumed.
One-year seedling survival was 26.7% (1000 seed-
lings/ha) on plots burned in 2000. One-year survival
on plots burned in 2001 was 11.0% (1250 seedlings/
ha). Mean 1-year survival was not signiﬁcantly (P 
0.05) affected by protection from large herbivores for
plots in either burn year. Two-year seedling survival
on plots burned in 2000 was 3.6% (200 seedlings/ha).
4. Discussion
4.1. F. ceanothus growth as related to
overstory density
Annual growth of F. ceanothus was negatively
related to overstory stand density (SDI), although
relationships we found were weak. Other researchers
have reported similarly weak relationships of shrub
production and ponderosa pine density although her-
bivory was not included in models (Uresk and Sever-
son, 1989; Moore and Deiter, 1992). Over the 4 years
of our study, ungulate herbivory appeared to be gen-
erally more important than SDI in explaining variation
in growth. This was not surprising since we previously
reported that F. ceanothus shrubs protected from deer
and elk retained nearly ﬁve times more current-year
biomass than that were not protected (Huffman and
Moore, 2003). Additionally, full models that included
both SDI and browsing as predictors of growth were
insigniﬁcant, or explained no more than 14% of the
variation in F. ceanothus growth, during 2 drought
years at our site (Table 1). Periodic drought is common
in southwestern ponderosa pine ecosystems and
appears to constrain understory response to overstory
thinning (Fule´ et al., 2002). Our results suggest that
substantial growth response to restoration treatments
may require several years at our site, particularly
under intense pressure from large herbivores.
4.2. Vegetative response to prescribed ﬁre
Although short ﬂame lengths suggested low ﬁre
intensity, temperatures lethal for F. ceanothus shrubs
were apparently generated belowground when burning
consumed more than about 3 cm of forest ﬂoor depth.
Detrital layers of 2–4 cm are common in ponderosa
pine forests of the southwest although depths of up to
8 cm have been reported where ﬁre has been excluded
for many years (Covington et al., 1997; Fule´ et al.,
2002). Although land managers are often concerned
with heat effects from burning in heavy slash (e.g.,
Fule´ et al., 2002), our data corroborates other ﬁndings
that indicate smoldering combustion in forest ﬂoor
fuels can have severe effects on important biota
(Covington and Sackett, 1984, 1990). Further research
is needed to determine if other factors, such as plant
age, soils, or climatic conditions after burning, affect
F. ceanothus response to prescribed ﬁre.
Plants that survived burning resprouted readily and
after two growing seasons burned plants were regain-
ing an all-age population structure. Sprouting after
disturbance and annual stem recruitment between
disturbances are important strategies for persistence
in competitive plant communities and where safe sites

for seedling establishment are rare (Keeley, 1977;
Kurmis and Sucoff, 1989; Huffman et al., 1994;
Tappeiner et al., 2001). For F. ceanothus, rapid recov-
ery of vertical stature after ﬁre is accomplished
through production of long, unbranched sprouts. This
capability was more fully expressed on plots protected
from large herbivores. Our ﬁndings corroborate to
those of Vose and White (1987) who found that burned
plants were nearly the same size as unburned plants 1
year after ﬁre. Since ﬂower and fruit production
appears to be related to stem size (Huffman, 2003;
Huffman and Moore, 2003), a quick return to preburn
stature may suggest an adaptive trait that allows
F. ceanothus to replenish dormant seed pools in the
interim periods between frequent ﬁres.
4.3. Regeneration from seed
F. ceanothus seedling emergence was related to
depth of forest ﬂoor consumed during experimental
burns. Probability of emergence was the greatest at
moderate depths (>2 and <7 cm) of consumption.
These results suggest that dormant seeds in soil seed
banks were stimulated to germinate after exposure to
heat from ﬁre (e.g., Story, 1974; Krishnan, 1989;
Huffman, 2003) but at greater depths of forest ﬂoor
consumption heat-induced mortality of seeds occurred
(Huffman, 2003). A dormant seed strategy is com-
monly reported for the Ceanothus genus (Gratkowski,
1974; Keeley, 1977, 1992; Noste, 1985; Conard et al.,
1985), although germination responses to temperature
and duration of heat appear to vary among species
(Quick, 1935). Although rates of long-term survival
and establishment of new genets is uncertain, recruit-
ment may offset ﬁre-related mortality of extant plants
at our site.
4.4. Management implications
As additional programs are established to restore
ecological function in ﬁre-prone, forest ecosystems, it
will be increasingly important to monitor understory
plant populations and identify biotic and operational
constraints to their recovery. On our site, tree thinning
from below and prescribed ﬁre treatments appeared to
have potential to increase F. ceanothus growth and
reproduction. Herbivory and drought, however, were
important in constraining plant growth for 4 years after
forest restoration treatments. Herbivory by wild ungu-
lates has been shown to be an important constraint on
restoration of other forest types (Augustine and Fre-
lich, 1998; Opperman and Merenlender, 2000). Man-
agement options to alleviate ungulate herbivory in
ponderosa pine forests include retaining scattered
slash after thinning operations to provide plants with
temporary protection, or modiﬁcation of landscape
features such as water catchments and roads to modify
animal spatial patterns (Reynolds, 1966; Severson and
Medina, 1983).
In our study, fuel conditions (i.e., forest ﬂoor depth)
and ﬁre behavior affected mortality of established
plants and seedling emergence. Similarly, Schimmel
and Granstro¨m (1996) showed that burn depth could
be used as an indicator of heat impact to belowground
propagules and affect population structure of several
understory species in boreal forests. This suggests that
burn plans may be formulated to achieve fuel con-
sumption targets as well as produce desired population
structures and understory plant community character-
istics. In turn, responses of common understory spe-
cies should be used as feedback in the adaptive process
to reﬁne ecological restoration prescriptions.
