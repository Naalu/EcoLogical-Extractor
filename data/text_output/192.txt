Effect of a Prescribed Burn in Ponderosa Pine
on Inorganic Nitrogen Concentrations
of Mineral Soil
Michael G. Ryan1
and
W. Wallace Covington2
Soil inorganic nitrogen was measured during the summer after
a fall prescribed burn at a ponderosa pine site in northern Arizona.
Fire behavior varied among sawtimber, pole, and sapling stands;
the greatest fuel reduction occurred in the sawtimber. Ammonium-
nitrogen content of the upper 15cm of soil in the burned sawtimber
plots was as much as 80 times greater than in unburned plots. This
is approximately 70 kg ha-1 more available N, a major fertilizing
effect. The soil under the burned pole plots had a slightly greater
inorganic nitrogen content than under unburned plots, while burn-
ing did not change the soil inorganic nitrogen in the sapling plots.
The increased availability of nitrogen after burning may affect
regeneration, understory growth, and growth of overstory trees.
Keywords: Fire ecology, inorganic nitrogen, nitrification, forest
soils, prescribed burning.
Fire has been excluded from many ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) stands in the South-
west for 60 to 100 years because of herbaceous fuel
reduction associated with heavy grazing, and wildfire
suppression activities. Exclusion of fire has changed the
structure of the timber stands (Cooper 1960) and has
caused heavy accumulations of forest floor and woody
fuels (Biswell1972). Consequently, the average size and
severity of wildfires in this type have increased greatly.'

Since the late 1940s, land managers in the Southwest
have been using prescribed burning to reduce heavy fuel
loads. Prescribed burning in ponderosa pine can have
a variety of immediate effects including plant mortali-
ty, fuel reduction (Sackett 1980), and partial surface
sterilization (Landsberg and Cochran 1980).Over longer
periods, burning may alter soil temperature, moisture,
and nutrient relations (Fuller et al. 1955, Vlamis et al.
1955), and thereby affect growth of woody and her-
baceous plants. Because nitrogen availability frequent-
ly is limiting in ponderosa pine ecosystems (Wagle and
Beasley 1968, Wagle and Kitchen 1972, Heidmann 1985),
changes in nitrogen mineralization after burning are
especially important. This note reports the results of a
study of soil inorganic nitrogen content during the sum-
mer after a fall prescribed burn. These first-year effects
are important for understanding changes in seedling
establishment and growth, understory production, forage
quality, and nutrient losses resulting from burning.

Research Area
The Chimney Spring area is in the eastern part of the
Fort Valley Experimental Forest, about 10 km northwest
of Flagstaff, Ariz. The Fort Valley Experimental Forest
was established in 1908 and is considered to be repre-
sentative of ponderosa pine in the Southwest. The
climate is subhumid to humid, combined with cool
temperatures;
the
ponderosa
pine
type
is
also
characterized by deficient early summer moisture. Mean
annual temperature at Fort Valley is 7°C, and the mean
annual precipitation is 57.4 cm (Schubert 1974). Approx-
imately one-half of the precipitation falls as snow.
The soil is a Brolliar stony clay loam, tentatively classi-
fied as a fine, montmorillonitic, frigid, typic Argibo-
roll.' Brolliar soils have a low infiltration rate, and
depth to basalt flow rock is typically 50-100 cm.
The ponderosa pine stand studied was characterized
by groups of even-aged trees clustered within an uneven-
aged stand. The average number of stems per hectare
for each overstory size class was: saplings (1.5-9.9 ern
d.b.h.)-2,750, poles (10.0-27.5 cm d.b.h.)-no, and
sawtimber (greater than 27.5 em d.b.h.)-130 (Sackett
1980). Basal area averaged 33 m2 ha-1 for all trees 10 cm
d.b.h. or larger, (Sackett 1980). No fire had occurred for
100 years prior to the 1976 prescribed burn (Dieterich
1980);before 1876, fires burned at approximately 2-year
intervals.
The
area
was
virtually
undisturbed
by
harvesting (Sackett 1980). The elevation ranges from
2,195 m to 2,255 m with gentle slopes (0-5%).
The study area was burned at night using a combina-
tion of backing fires and short strip head fires, A descrip-
tion of conditions before and after the burn and of the
burn itself was presented by Sackett (1980). Tree mor-
tality from burning was confined to isolated mature trees
and to younger trees near heavy fuel accumulations.
Overall, forest floor material less than 2.5 ern diameter
was reduced by 63% from 32.0 to 11.9 metric tons ha':'.
The greatest reduction in forest floor depth occurred in
the sawtimber type, perhaps because of high pre-burn
fuel loading (Sackett 1980). The amount of litter con-
sumed on the pole plots varied from light to heavy, while
litter consumption on the sapling plots was slight
(Sackett 1980). Changes in nutrient content of the woody
debris and forest floor were reported in Covington and
Sackett (1984).
Methods
Twenty-eight 1 ha plots, with five permanent basal area
points each, were established (Sackett 1980); 18 plots
were burned in November 1976. North-south and east-
west lines that intersected the basal area points defined
a set of quadrants. Each quadrant was classified into one
of three categories-saplings, poles, or sawtimber-based

on the composition of the overstory in that quadrant.
Quadrants with large downed logs, roads, stumps, or
mixed overstory were excluded from the study (20% of
the quadrants). The dominant overstory type was pole
(55%of the quadrants), followed by sawtimber (15%) and
sapling (10%).
Information from preliminary sampling was utilized
to determine the most time-efficient combination of the
number of composite samples per overstory cover class
and subsamples per composite that would yield a
variance low enough to detect meaningful changes in soil
inorganic nitrogen content (Falck 1973). The combina-
tion of 4 randomly selected quadrants per treatment and
10 subsamples per quadrant was used.
In each quadrant, three 7 m sampling lines were
established at angles of 23°, 45°, and 67° from the
quadrant boundaries. Mineral soil was sampled at ran-
domly selected 10 em intervals along these sample lines;
the 0 to 2 m interval of each sample line was excluded
to avoid sampling the effects of trampling around the plot
center. All litter, including partially burned fragments,
was removed before soil core samples were taken. For
each collection period, soil cores were extracted and
composited from each of 10 randomly selected segments
in each quadrant.
The mineral soil was sampled with a soil corer to a
depth of 15 em . Samples were stored under ice in a
cooler prior to analysis. Soils were sampled four times
in 19n, beginning 8 months after the fire-July 14, July
29, August 5, and August 25 (periods 1-4, respectively).
Field moist soils were used for laboratory analysis. The
composite samples were screened and the fractions
greater than 2 mm were discarded. A 25 g subsample
was placed in a preweighed container, weighed, dried
to a constant weight at 105° C, and reweighed to deter-
mine moisture content. A 1:1soil to water paste was used
to determine pH on a separate sample.
A representative sample (20-25 g) of the wet soil
«2 mm) was weighed and placed in a 500 ml flask; 2N
KC1(10 ml per gram of wet soil) was added in order to
extract the inorganic nitrogen (Bremner 1965). The soil
and extractant solution was shaken intermittently for 1
hour, was filtered, and the filtrate then was refrigerated.
All samples were extracted the same day they were col-
lected, and were analyzed within 3 weeks.
Ammonium-nitrogen (NH;-N) and nitrite (NO;-NJ plus
nitrate-nitrogen (NO;-N) was determined by macrodis-
tillation with MgO and Devarda's alloy-an adaptation
of the steam distillation method (Bremner 1965). Because
the predominant form of oxidized nitrogen in these soils
is nitrate, nitrite plus nitrate-nitrogen is designated as
NO;-N in this note. Caution should be exercised in
comparing these distillation results with those obtained
by the colorimetric AutoAnalyzer procedure. For exam-
ple,
White
and
Gosz
(1981) found
that standard
automated techniques may overestimate NH;-N in some
samples, perhaps because of amino acid interference.
The experiment was a two-factor analysis of variance
with repeated measures: two treatments (burn and con-
trol), three overstory size classes (sapling, pole, and
sawtimber), and four sampling dates (periods 1-4),

ly higher than all other treatment-overstory combinations
for period 4 (table 3). The correlation between NH;-N
and soil moisture content was not significant, while the
correlation between NO;-N and soil moisture content
was positive and significant (R = 0.54). The pH ranged
from 6.2 to 6.5 throughout the study, and was not sig-
nificantly affected by burning.
Discussion
Other studies of fire effects on western coniferous soils
have shown either direct or indirect increases in in-
organic nitrogen (Brown et al. 1973, St. John and Rundel
1976, Stark 1977). For example, 18 months after a
prescribed burn in a Sierran coniferous forest, NH;-N
was approximately 6 times and NO;-N was 1.5 times
unburned controls (St. John and RundeI1976). However,
these changes disappeared after the onset of the grow-
ing season. Therefore, the 20-80 times increase in soil
ammonium in the sawtimber type and the retention of
these high concentrations for 2 months of the growing
season in this study is particularly striking.
The inorganic nitrogen and moisture content response
was concentrated in the sawtimber type. This response
appears to be related to the severity of the fire under the
mature sawtimber trees, where heavy fuel accumulations
were almost completely consumed. The nearly complete
consumption of sawtimber litter, together with possible
mortality of fine 'roots," may be responsible for the
treatment effect. Because no measurements of soil in-
organic nitrogen were taken directly after the prescribed
burn, it is not known whether the source of the increased

NH;-N is pyrolysis of organic compounds (Cristensen
1973, DeBano et al. 1979, Mroz et a1. 1980) or increased
mineralization.
The high NH;-N content of soil in the burned
sawtimber type provides an increased substrate for nitri-
fying organisms. However, soil NO;-N content re-
mained stable throughout the growing season, suggesting
no apparent increase in nitrification rates. Nitrifying
bacteria are sensitive to soil heating (Wells et a1. 1979).
Therefore, soil heating may have decreased populations
of nitrifiers initially, followed by a gradual recovery. The
significant increase in NO;-N concentrations in the
burned sawtimber class in period 4 as control concen-
trations declined supports this explanation.
These
results
show that prescribed burning in
ponderosa pine can increase nitrogen availability the
year after the burn, particularly where forest floor loads
are heavy. For example, based on the soil survey data
of Meurrise.' the burned sawtimber sites had approx-
imately 70 kg ha-1 more available nitrogen than the con-
trols. This increase in available nitrogen may be partially
responsible for the increases in pine seedling establish-
ment and growth (Sackett 1984, Haase 1981) as well as
increases in production and nitrogen content of the
understory (Harris and Covington 1983) after burning
at this study area. However, the persistance of high
NH;-N levels after this first year is not known.
