ABSTRACT  
There is increasing interest in the restoration of classic landscapes such as native grasslands in the 
northeastern United States. This stu dy characterizes the species composition and range of natural 
variability of xeric limestone prairies in unglaciated central Appalachia. Bouteloua curtipendula, the 
characteristic and dominant graminoid, is the primary indicator species for xeric limestone prairies in 
Pennsylvania, and its distribution is restricted to dry, south-southwest facing slopes within the valleys of 
the Ridge and Valley Physiographic Province. Only ten such prairies are known to remain in Pennsylvania 
and their total area is < 1 hectare. A total of 126 native taxa representing 40 families was found on the 
extant prairies. Twelve rare, state-listed prairie species were found on these sites, and their state-wide 
distributions also were concentrated in the Ridge and Valley . In comparison to Ohio and West Virginia 
limestone prairies, community structure, determined by dominant graminoids, was identical, but species 
composition, particularly related to prairie forb assemblages, was slightly different (average Sorenson 
similarity coefficient = 38%). The limestone prairies of Pennsylvania have a strong association with the 
Opequon soil series, which is found only in limestone valleys. Xeric limestone prairies in Pennsylvania likely 
were never a large component of the presettlement landscape, were likely concentrated in central 
Pennsylvania, and currently serve as important refugia for uncommon eastern prairie species. 
INTRODUCTION 
There is great interest among restoration ecologists in characterizing the presettlement 
landscape and its flora (Noss 1985), yet widespread habitat loss and degradation make it 
difficult to discern the distribution of native plant communities before the arrival of European 
settlers. This is especially difficult in the eastern United States where there has been a long 
history of human disturbance. Nonetheless, interest is increasing in the restoration and rec­
reation of classic landscapes (Jordan 1994), such as grassland, in Pennsylvania (Steiner 2001). 
Determining reference conditions for these rare plant communities is the first step toward 
successful restoration. The concept of reference conditions refers to the state of an ecosystem 
prior to Euro-American settlement (Fule et al. 1997, Moore et al. 1999, Stephenson 1999) and 
can be used as a criterion for determining the scope and evaluating the success of restoration 
projects (Christensen et al. 1996). Reference conditions, in the case of eastern xeric limestone 
prairies, refer to the prairie's presettlement plant species composition, regional distribution, 
and abundance. This study characterizes the species composition and range of natural vari­
ability of xeric limestone prairies in unglaciated central Appalachia to provide land managers 
with ''base datum" (Leopold 1941) conditions that will guide prairie restoration efforts. 
Pennsylvania (literally translated "Penns woods") is renowned for its vast and rolling 
upland forests, yet not all historical accounts describe it as such. At the time of Euro-American 
settlement in the late 18th century, valleys within the Ridge and Valley Physiographic Province 
harbored mosaics ofgrassland and open woodland. Historical accounts describe large grasslands 
at the time of European settlement in Penns Valley, Centre County (Losensky 1961, Macneal

1998, Ruffner and Arabas 2000), in Buffalo Valley, Union County (Allen 1876), and in the 
limestone regions of the Great Valley Physiographic Province in Franklin County (Klotz and 
Walck 1993). Perhaps the most striking limestone grassland was known as the "Great Plains" in 
Penns Valley. These "plains" were perched on an upland limestone shield that is a common 
geological feature of valley floors in the Ridge and Valley region of central Appalachia. Philip 
Vickers Fithian, a traveling minister, visited Penns Valley in 1775 and wrote in his journal, "In 
this valley there are large open plains, cleared either by the Indians or accidental fire. Hundreds 
of acres are covered with fine grass and a great variety of flowers " (Albion and Dodson 1934). 
Written accounts and other historical documents such as land warrants provide a convincing 
account of the nature and location of the Great Plains but yield little detail about prairie 
reference conditions. The only ecologically significant information we can discern from these 
earlier accounts is that these grasslands were very dry, stretched on for several miles in length, 
and contained a "great variety of flowers." 
What relationship is there between the historic grasslands and the extant limestone 
prairies of today? Macneal (1998) and Losensky (1961) utilized property descriptions from the 
original land warrants in the late 18th century to delineate the Great Plains. A small remnant 
grassland community [comprised of one main patch and several other smaller patches (total 
area = 0.1 ha)] that harbors several rare prairie plants exists within the boundary of the Great 
Plains. The most dominant grass species is the C4 perennial Bouteloua curtipendula (sideoats 
grama), which is most abundant in the central plains and southwestern states on dry, upland 
sites (Bazzaz and Parrish 1982), but is threatened in Pennsylvania. Eight other state-listed 
grassland species persist in this remnant, including Anemone cylindrica (the only known 
population in Pennsylvania), Bromus kalmii, Lithospermum canescens, Linum sulcatum, 
Onosmodium molle var. hispidissimum, Panicum oligosanthes, Ranunculus fascicularis, and 
Solidago rigida (nomenclature follows Rhoads and Block 2000). Many other uncommon species 
(see Appendix) are found among the limestone prairie patches, and according to Kunsman 
(1990), "There are probably very few sites in Pennsylvania that have so many rare or otherwise 
uncommon species growing together." 
This rare upland community has been referred to as a "Side-oats gramma calcareous 
grassland" (Fike 1999), but is more appropriately defined as a "xeric limestone prairie" (sensu 
Baskin et al. 1994 and Baskin and Baskin 2000) since it is structurally and floristically similar 
to limestone prairies in West Virginia (Bartgis 1993; C.C. Baskin, pers. comm.), Ohio (Braun 
1928), and Missouri (Baskin and Baskin 2000, Ware 2002). This community is distinct from 
"cedar glades" primarily because it is dominated by a C4 perennial grass rather than C4 annual 
grasses (Baskin et al. 1994; Baskin and Baskin 1999, 2000); it is also distinct from "barrens", 
such as the Big Barrens region of Tennessee and Kentucky, because it is found on shallow, rocky 
soils rather than on deep, arable soils (Baskin et a1. 1994, Chester et al. 1997). This unique 
prairie remnant has been known since at least 1959 (Westerfeld 1959), but the current study is 
the first to demonstrably link the extant limestone prairie to the historical accounts of grassland 
in central Pennsylvania. 
What can the current distribution, abundance, and species composition of xeric limestone 
prairies tell us about their presettlement reference conditions? Diamond (1999) stressed the 
importance of patterns and trends in piecing together environmental history. This study relates 
trends and associations of rare plant distributions, soil types, and geographical variables among 
the extant Pennsylvania limestone prairies to provide insight into their presettlement dis­
tribution and abundance. 
METHODS 
Prairie Distribution 
To examine the distribution of limestone prairies, we used Pennsylvania Natural 
Diversity Inventory (PNDI) field surveys, aerial photographs and field reconnaissance to locate 
extant populations of Bouteloua curtipendula. Since limestone prairies in Pennsylvania are 
DECEMBER 2003 

generally dominated by Bouteloua curtipendula, we mapped the distribution of these prairies by 
plotting the known extant populations. 
To determine the general pre settlement extent of limestone prairies in Pennsylvania, we 
mapped the distribution of rare eastern limestone prairie species that currently persist on the 
remnants. There are 12 (including Bouteloua curtipendula) eastern prairie species (plants of 
dry, "non-forested areas in the eastern United States," J.M. Baskin, pers. comm.) growing in 
association with B. curtipendula that are listed in Pennsylvania as endangered, threatened, or 
of special concern: Anemone cylindrica, Bromus kalmii, Linum sulcatum, Lithospermum 
canescens, Onosmodium molle var. hispidissimum, Ophioglossum engelmannii, Panicum 
oligosanthes, Ranunculus fascicularis, Ruellia humulis, Senna marilandica, and Solidago 
rigida. Using distribution information in Rhoads and Klein (1993) as a reference, these species 
were plotted on a map of Pennsylvania and each county was ranked according to the density of 
rare species that occurs there. 
Species Composition 
Since no historical accounts describe the presettlement plant species composition of these 
grasslands, we conducted floristic inventories of extant prairies. Each of the 10 study sites, 
which account for all known limestone prairies in Pennsylvania, was visited at least three times 
throughout the growing season of the year 2001 (late spring, mid-summer, and fall) and every 
native herbaceous plant was recorded and ranked with a qualitative abundance value. Only 
common woody plants detected at least once in every 100 m2 within or surrounding the prairies 
were recorded. Abundance values were classified as follows: 1 = one flowering stem per 100 m2 
or on the entire site, 2 = 2 to 10 stems per 100 m2, 3 = 11-50 stems per 100 m2, 4 = 51-100 
stems per 100 m2, and 5 = 101-500 stems per 100 m2. 
Importance Values were assigned to all species based on relative abundance and species 
presence. Relative abundance was calculated by averaging the midpoints of each abundance 
class (e.g., the midpoint of Abundance Class 2 is six, since the class ranges from 2 to 10 stems per 
100 m2) across all prairie sites. Importance Values were calculated by multiplying a species' 
relative abundance by the proportion of prairies in which the species was found. For example, 
the relative abundance of Panicum oligosanthes is 3.6 stems per 100 m2 per study site and 
the proportion of prairies it was detected in is 0.2; therefore, the Importance Value for 
P. oligosanthes is 0.72. 
Community coefficients (CC), based on Sorenson's Species-presence Index of Similarity 
(Mueller-Dombois and Ellenberg 1974, Barbour et al. 1999), were used to compare the floristic 
similarities of the 10 limestone prairies, and also to compare the limestone prairies of 
Pennsylvania to those of West Virginia (Bartgis 1993) and Ohio (Braun 1928). It is difficult to 
make direct comparisons between the species lists of the West Virginia and Ohio prairies since 
sampling methodology differed slightly among the studies (i.e., Bartgis 1993, included glade 
woodland species in his list). Therefore, data sets were adjusted (i.e., exotic species, tree canopy 
dominants, and forest plants were removed) so that native herbaceous prairie species 
composition was used to determine the CCs. 
A Mantel test (Mantel 1967) was used to determine the relationship between geographical 
distance (a matrix defined by prairie location in decimal degrees) and ecological distance 
(McCune and Grace 2002). This test was used to test the hypothesis that prairies in closer 
proximity to each other are more floristically similar. In this study, we define ecological distance 
as the distance in ordination space between the prairies determined by species composition and 
relative abundance. Mantel's (1967) asymptotic approximation was used to evaluate the test 
statistic. The Mantel test was performed in PC-ORD (McCune and Mefford 1999). 
Physical Characteristics 
Physical characteristics, including soil types and topographical orientation, of the prairies 
were measured to gain an understanding of the range of environmental variables that allow 
limestone prairies to persist and also to determine indirectly their presettlement distribution 
and abundance. Soil surveys (Long 1975, Braker 1981, Lipscomb and Farley 1981, Eckenrode 
CASTANEA VOLUME 68 

1985, Kohler 1986, Zarichansky 1986) were utilized to determine the soil series on which the 
prairies are currently found. Soil texture and pH were also measured for each study site. Seven 
random locations within each prairie were chosen to extract five em deep soil cores. The samples 
from within each prairie were combined and mixed together for analysis. Soil texture was 
determined using the hydrometer method with a Bouyoucos scale (Gee and Bauder 1986). Soil 
pH values were measured in soil solutions with soil to water ratios of 1, with an addition of 
CaCl2 to more closely resemble the actual field conditions (Brady and Weil 1998). Because soil 
depth is so difficult to measure in these habitats (Baskin and Baskin 1999) and because mea­
suring percent rock fragments requires destructive sampling, the ranges were pooled from the 
soil survey literature. Therefore, the data on soil depth and percent rock fragments should be 
interpreted as approximations, rather than as accurate field measurements. In many cases, the 
soils at the study sites are much more shallow « 10 em) and have greater proportions of rock 
fragments than what is reported in the literature (D.C. Laughlin, pers. obs.). 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Prairie Distribution 
The current distribution of xeric limestone prairies in Pennsylvania suggests that they 
always have been confined to a particular physiographic region. Bouteloua curtipendula is 
restricted to the Ridge and Valley Physiographic Province of central-southcentral Pennsylvania 
(Figure 1), except for a few occurrences in the extreme southeast on serpentine barrens (Wherry 
1963, Rhoads and Klein 1993; J. Kunsman, pers. comm.), a distinctly different plant 
community-type. With the exception of the southeastern populations, there are 11 known 
populations of Bouteloua curtipendula in Pennsylvania. Ten of the 11 populations are limestone 
prairie remnants; the other population occurs on a streamside cliff edge with plants not found in 
limestone prairies, and is therefore ignored in this analysis. 
The distributions of the 12 rare prairie species are concentrated in central Pennsylvania. 
The counties in the Ridge and Valley harbor the highest density of rare prairie plants, and 9 of 
the 12 species are found in Centre County alone (Figure 2). This suggests that limestone prairies 
were located predominantly in central Pennsylvania. 
Species Composition 
A total of 126 native taxa representing 40 families was found among the 10 study sites: 20 
graminoids, 80 forbs (74 perennials and 6 annualsl biennials), 3 ferns, and 23 woody plants 
(Appendix). Native species richness ranged from 20-57 species per site (Table 1), which is 
similar to the 21-54 species per site in the southern Ridge and Valley limestone barrens 
(DeSelm 1993). There was no relationship between richness and prairie size (r 2 = 0.054, p > 
0.05). Three graminoids, Bouteloua curtipendula, Danthonia spicata, and Schizachyrium 
scoparium, dominated in terms of abundance, but common forbs, such as Anemone virginiana, 
Solidago nemoralis, Monarda fistulosa, Lithospermum canescens, Asclepias tuberosa, A. 
verticillata, A. oiridiflora, Penstemon hirsutus, and Senecio obovatus, contributed greatly to 
species richness (Table 2). This suite of herbaceous species, when found growing together, can be 
considered an indicator of this habitat and can be used not only to discover unknown prairie 
sites, but also to identify potential sites for prairie restoration. Surprisingly, only five legumes 
were found among all 10 prairies; this is low compared to the 66 legumes detected in southern 
Ridge and Valley glades and barrens (DeSelm 1993) and the 18 legumes detected in West 
Virginia limestone prairies (Bartgis 1993). The most common woody species associated with 
these prairies are Juniperus virginiana, Juglans nigra, Celtis occidentalis, Pinus strobus, and 
P. virginiana. 
The methodology used to generate this species list likely omits some important taxa that 
were present in presettlement times that may have been extirpated from the region; hence, the 
list is incomplete. Furthermore, this methodology likely adds some common native taxa that are 
currently present on extant prairies that may not have occurred on these prairies in the past. 
Nevertheless, the appended list represents the best possible information on the native species

composition of xeric limestone prairies in Pennsylvania. Therefore, Table 2 and the Appendix 
can be used as templates for determining the future species composition of restored and rec­
reated limestone prairies in central Pennsylvania. 
Exotic invasion is likely a significant reason for the loss of native species from limestone 
prairies. Herbaceous exotics such as Coronilla varia L., Daucus carota L., Lonicera japonica 
Thunb., Melilotus Mill. spp ., and Verbascum thapsus L. are common on many of the limestone 
prairies. Centaurea maculosa Lam. is particularly problematic at the Westfall Ridge and 
Tytoona Cave prairies and is present on many others. Woody exotics, such as Elaeagnus 
umbellata Thunb., Ligustrum vulgare L., Lonicera morrowii AGray, Lonicera tatarica L., and 
Rhamnus cathartica L., invade from the periphery and have caused a significant reduction in 
the areal extent of the prairies throughout the 20th century (Laughlin 2002). 
Many native species that were recorded in the prairies by PNDI field surveys less than 20 
years ago were not detected in the present surveys. Trichostema brachiatum and Thalictrum 
revolutum occurred in two prairies in the past but were not detected in the present study. Aster 
ericoides, Heliopsis helianthoides, Rudbeckia trilobata, Viburnum rafinesquianum, Quercus 
prinoides, Scutellaria elliptica, Sporobolus asper, and Liatris scariosa were present in at least one 
prairie previously but were not detected in any prairie in the present study (Appendix). Species 
that disappeared from some prairies yet remained in others include Antennaria neglecta, Aster 
novae-angliae, Aster pilosus, Aster urophyllus, Euthamia graminifolia, Solidago nemoralis, 
Calystegia spithamaea,Desmodiumpaniculatum, D. rotundifolia,Spiranthes lacera var.gracilis, 
Andropogon gerardii, Andropogon virginicus, Danthonia spicata, Schizachyrium scoparium, and 
Galium circaezans. There is a chance that some species were not detected because the plants may 
have been dormant due to the mild drought of 2001. However, this loss of native species is a trend 
that is likely to continue ifthe habitats are not properly managed and maintained. 
Though the limestone prairies in Pennsylvania are structurally very similar, i.e., the 
communities are dominated by C4 perennial grasses (Baskin et al. 1994, Baskin and Baskin 
1999, 2000), mainly Bouteloua curtipendula (Table 2), there are important differences in spe­
cies composition among the prairies. Sorenson Community Coefficients (CC) for all possible

pair-wise combinations between the 10 prairies were low. The average (z st. dev.) CC across all 
prairies was 38.3 :!::: 8.0% (range == 24-55%). Even when outlier species (those found at only one 
prairie) were removed from the dataset, the average CC was still only 42.3 :!::: 8.1% (range == 28­
56%). These relatively low similarity indeces indicate that individual prairies contain different 
combinations of prairie forbs and that many forbs are found only at a few prairies. Indeed, five of 
the rare prairie species were detected only once, each at different prairies. Therefore, we suggest 
that if conserving the maximum number of limestone prairie plants in Pennsylvania is desired 
by land managers, then several, rather than few, prairies should be protected, and new pop­
ulations of rare prairie species should be introduced into the remnant prairies. 
The limestone prairies of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, considered in aggregate, 
also exhibit slight dissimilarities (average CC == 38%), even though the prairies are all 
structurally similar and the most abundant species are common to all three states (Table 2). The 
CC between Pennsylvania and West Virginia prairies was 40%; the CC between Pennsylvania 
and Ohio prairies was 43%; the CC between West Virginia and Ohio prairies was 32%. These 
dissimilarities may be due to differences in total native species richness. Pennsylvania prairies 
(total native species richness == 126 species) harbor fewer native species than West Virginia 
(approx. 144 species)and Ohio (approx. 197 species) prairies. Ohio prairies are likely the richest 
in species because they are closer to the rich tallgrass prairies of the Midwest (Ladd 1997). 
Pennsylvania prairies, on the other hand, are on the edge of many prairie species ranges. 
Pennsylvania and West Virginia limestone prairies harbor considerably fewer species 
than the glades and barrens ofthe southern Ridge and Valley, which contain 803 native species 
(including woody plants) (DeSelm 1993). Bouteloua curtipendula is present on a few southern 
sites, but the dominant graminoids tend to be Schizachyrium. scoparium. and Andropogon 
gerardii (DeSelm et al. 1969, DeSelm 1993). The CC between Pennsylvania limestone prairies 
and the southern Ridge and Valley glades and barrens was 21%. However, 75% of the species 
in Pennsylvania prairies are also found in the southern Ridge and Valley. Moreover, four rare 
species detected in northern limestone prairies, namely Bouteloua curtipendula, Linum 
sulcatum, Panicum oligosanthes (=P. scribnerianum), and Sporobolus asper, are also

considered notable and "rare" on southern barrens (DeSelm et a1. 1969, DeSelm 1993). 
Limestone prairies in the northern Ridge and Valley are quite distinct from barrens on the 
Pennyroyal Plain of Tennessee and Kentucky because the barrens do not harbor populations of 
Bouteloua curtipendula, the barrens are found on deep soils, and the barrens contain far more 
native species (native richness = 311) (Baskin et al. 1994, Chester et al. 1997). 
Limestone prairies in Pennsylvania that are closer together geographically are also more 
floristically similar (Mantel test, r = 0.42, p = 0.02). We suggest that this lends support to the 
hypothesis that, prior to Euro-American settlement, there was more connectivity between 
limestone prairies on a landscape scale. Native prairie propagules could once move among 
prairies; hence, prairies that were closer together were more floristically similar. Landscape 
fragmentation has since isolated a once more connected system of prairies, and wind and animal 
dispersed species, such as Bouteloua curtipendula, can no longer move among prairies 
(Laughlin 2003). 
Physical Characteristics 
Limestone prairies are limited to specific microhabitats within the Ridge and Valley 
Physiographic Province and occur only in the valleys where limestone soils predominate. All 
are found on south-southwest facing slopes (average slope = 13°) and range in elevation from 
190-370 m above sea level (Table 1). It must be noted, however, that in times such as the 
Hypsithermal (10,000 to 7,000 14C yr BP) and the "Medieval Climatic Optimum" (ca. AD 900­
1300), this region experienced warmer and drier climatic conditions (Webb et al. 1983, Brush 
1991). Moreover, prior to the 18th century, landscapes in Pennsylvania were influenced by an 
anthropogenic fire regime (Lindestrom 1925, Abrams 1992). Under these various conditions, 
limestone prairies were likely not as restricted to southern and southwestern exposures, as was 
the case with the "cedar glades" of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Missouri (Delcourt et al. 1986). 
Eight of the ten known Pennsylvania limestone prairies are found on the Opequon soil 
series (Table 3). These sites also are associated with the Hagerstown and Elliber soil series. The 
Opequon series (taxonomically defined as a Lithic Hapludalf) consists of shallow (30-50 cm 
deep), rocky (often with exposed bedrock), and well-drained soils with low soil-water avail­
ability. Opequon soils are found on convex uplands and formed in limestone residuum (Braker 
1981). The Hagerstown series (a Typic Hapludalf) consists of deep (100-180 em), well-drained 
limestone soils on valley uplands and can also be quite rocky (Long 1975). The Elliber series (a 
Typic Hapludult) consists of deep (100 to 200 ern), well-drained soils rich with chert and is found 
on the sides of ridges in valley uplands (Lipscomb and Farley 1981). 
The soils on all 10 sites are very similar (Table 3). Most are clay loams that are neutral 
with an average soil pH of 7.23. According to the soil surveys, the soils average 17% rock

fragments (range = 0-75%), and average 66 cm deep to limestone bedrock (range = 3D-150 em). 
However, on most sites, exposed bedrock was common and the soils were rarely deeper than 
10 cm (D.C. Laughlin, pers. obs.; see Methods). These landscape and soil variables should be 
considered when determining suitable sites for limestone prairie restoration. 
The xeric nature of these prairies results from the combination of south-southwest facing 
slopes and rocky, well-drained, shallow limestone soils. Other studies have documented that 
Bouteloua curtipendula typically occurs on this type of soil. "Xeric prairies" in Ohio that harbor 
abundant stands of B. curtipendula occur exclusively on shallow, rocky soils derived from 
dolomite (Braun 1928). Other researchers in Ohio have documented B. curtipendula growing on 
soils "derived from Peebles dolomite [that] are generally shallow and poorly developed" (Annala 
et al. 1983, Annala and Kaputska 1983). On Tennessee barrens, B. curtipendula grows most 
abundantly where the soil is only 10 em deep (DeSelm 1994). In Texas, B. curtipendula grows in 
soils with relatively high clay content ( ~60%), neutral pH (6.9-7.4), and low rainfall (Diamond 
and Smeins 1985, Smeins and Diamond 1983). Bouteloua curtipendula is also abundant on 
intermediate and shallow soils that contain 5-70% limestone fragments (Fuhlendorf and Smeins 
1998). Apparently, many limestone prairie remnants persist because the herbaceous plants that

§ The 3 numbers in the texture column represent the proportions of sand / silt / clay. 
* Percent rock and soil depth values were obtained from Long (1975), Braker (1981), Lipscomb and Farley (1981), 
Eckenrode (1985), Kohler (1986), and Zarichansky (1986) (see Methods). Midpoints were used to obtain the averages. 
grow in them can tolerate the shallow, dry and rocky conditions, while most woody species cannot 
withstand the harsh microclimate (Braun 1928, Annala and Kaputska 1983, DeSelm 1989). 
Not only do the extant limestone prairies have a strong association with Opequon soil, 
most of the historic Great Plains in central Pennsylvania was on the rocky and shallow 
Opequon-Hagerstown soil complex, which is an aggregation of predominantly Opequon soil 
(Braker 1981). The boundary of the Great Plains, as delineated by Macneal (1998), was used 
to determine the soil composition of the historic grassland. Nearly 60% of the land area is 
comprised of the Opequon-Hagerstown soil complex, and 27% of the area is pure Hagerstown 
soil. The Great Plains prairie remnant itself is found on pure Opequon soil where the soil is 
extremely shallow with much exposed limestone bedrock. 
Since limestone prairies have a strong association with Opequon soil, the distribution of 
Opequon delineates the natural distribution of limestone prairies. The distribution of Opequon 
in Pennsylvania is restricted to valleys within the Ridge and Valley Physiographic Province 
(Figure 3). Opequon soil is also found most abundantly in Centre County. The other two soil 
series (Hagerstown and Elliber) associated with limestone prairies in Pennsylvania are found 
also almost exclusively in the Ridge and Valley. 
If we assume that xeric limestone prairies are limited to Opequon soil in Pennsylvania, 
then it is possible to make generalizations about their former coverage in presettlement times. 
We tallied the total acreage of each of the three relevant soil series in every county within the 
Ridge and Valley using the county soil surveys. The total land area in the Ridge and Valley of 
Pennsylvania is roughly 4 million ha. The Hagerstown series comprises 125,356 ha, the Elliber 
series 21,448 ha, and the Opequon series 32,985 ha. Opequon is not an abundant soil series in 
the Ridge and Valley (0.8% of the total land area). The total area of the three soil series is 
179,789 ha, which is only 4.4% of the entire Ridge and Valley. This percentage is an over­
estimate ofland area capable of supporting limestone prairies, since Opequon soil on north-facing 
slopes will not support xeric limestone prairies. Clearly, available prairie habitat is limited. 
We believe this paints a realistic picture of the valleys in presettlement central Pennsylvania: 
a landscape dominated by oak-chestnut forests (Braun 1950), occasionally interspersed with 
small patches of xeric limestone prairies.

counties have not yet been digitized. 
Anthropogenic influence 
The origin of xeric limestone prairies is a topic of some debate. Without direct human 
management, at least 10 prairies in Pennsylvania have persisted to the present. However, over 
the last 60 years, at least two prairies have decreased considerably in size due to woody .plant 
invasion (Laughlin 2002). We attribute this phenomenon to the lack of fire, which may have 
been more common in presettlement Pennsylvania when native Delaware Indians used fire as 
a hunting and management tool (Lindestrom 1925, Abrams 1992), and to the lack of browsing 
pressure by native ungulates; woody species tend to respond negatively to fire and browsing 
(Adams et al. 1982, Pendergrass et al. 1998, Ritchie et al. 1998). This suggests that xeric 
limestone prairies in Pennsylvania were, at least in part, anthropogenically maintained like 
other xeric limestone prairies in the eastern United States (Baskin et al. 1994). However, it is 
clear that woody species recruitment is also impaired by the lack of suitable moisture in the 
rocky, shallow soils (Braun 1928, DeSelm et al. 1969, DeSelm 1993; D.C. Laughlin, pers. obs.), 
Therefore, without the extremely rocky conditions of the soil, few prairies would have persisted. 
Nevertheless, ifrestoration practitioners do not reintroduce the appropriate disturbance agents 
to maintain the open, grass-dominated structure of the prairies, it is likely they will one day be 
lost from the landscape entirely. 
Further research into other aspects oflimestone prairie ecology would greatly improve our 
understanding of xeric limestone prairie reference conditions. Reference conditions include 
more than presettlement species composition, abundance, and regional distribution. They also 
include ecological processes, such as presettlement fire regimes (Moore et al. 1999), which 
DECEMBER 2003 

determine community structure and function. For example, Guyette and McGinnes (1982) 
determined that fire frequency declined in an Ozark glade after Euro-American settlement. 
Currently, detailed fire records (both recent and paleoecological) are unknown for areas in 
Pennsylvania where limestone prairies occur, yet understanding the role of fire in eastern 
limestone prairies would be very useful for developing management practices for both remnant 
and restored prairies. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Associations between xeric limestone prairie distribution, abundance, and plant species 
composition in Pennsylvania yield insight into the presettlement qualities of these prairies. In 
Pennsylvania, xeric limestone prairies are currently restricted to limestone soils on south­
southwest facing slopes in the valleys of the Ridge and Valley Physiographic Province. Since the 
ecological variables required to support limestone prairies are not abundant, limestone prairies 
in Pennsylvania were likely never a large component of the presettlement landscape. The con­
centration of Opequon soil and rare prairie plants in Centre County suggests that limestone 
prairie abundance was greatest in central Pennsylvania. It is appropriate to limit xeric lime­
stone prairie restoration to regions where they have occurred in the past. 
Limestone prairie habitat in Pennsylvania is seriously threatened. Less than one ha of 
xeric limestone prairies in aggregate is known to still exist in Pennsylvania. Drought tolerant 
woody species also are invading these small prairies, and, with the continued exclusion offire, the 
prairies are slowly changing into shrub fields or cedar woodlands, much like limestone prairies in 
the Ozarks (Baskin and Baskin 2000, Ware 2002) and in the southern Ridge and Valley (DeSelm 
et al. 1969). Given the interest in landscape scale models for conservation and restoration, it is 
important to include limestone prairies in efforts to restore native plant communities in central 
Pennsylvania. The extant limestone prairies are more than just ecological anomalies. They 
are historical, cultural and ecological reminders of a time when natural processes, including 
anthropogenic influences, created a dynamic mosaic of habitats throughout central Appalachia. 
The restoration and re-creation of xeric limestone prairies will ensure their survival and 
ultimately enrich our understanding of the presettlement landscape of central Pennsylvania.
