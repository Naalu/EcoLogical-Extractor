Abstract
We analyzed attributes of tree encroachment on montane meadows and subalpine grasslands
on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park. Species composition, age, density,
height, diameter, condition class, and patterns of tree establishment were examined on belt
transects at 12 meadow sites. Of the 3481 live and dead trees sampled, 52% of all trees were
Populus tremuloides, 20% were Picea spp., 11% were Abies lasiocarpa, 10% were Abies
concolor, and 7% were Pinus ponderosa. Tree densities averaged 4703 trees ha1. Sixty-
two percent of the trees sampled were less than 20 yr of age, although some species
established in the early and mid-1800s. Ninety-one percent of all trees, however, established
after the mid-1930s, with the greatest establishment occurring after the early 1970s. Of this
91%, Populus tremuloides composed the majority (90%) of recent tree recruitment, with
a mean establishment date of 1983–1984. A general pattern of progressively younger trees
from the closed forest toward the meadow interiors was detected for some species, and
together with little evidence of historical tree occurrence (e.g., large standing dead, downed
logs, etc.) on the transects, indicated that trees had been encroaching on these meadows
since the 1800s. These trends suggest a loss of important meadow habitat and landscape
biodiversity within Grand Canyon National Park during the past century.
Introduction
Montane meadows and subalpine grasslands are important
components in many western forest ecosystems. On the North Rim of
Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP), meadows and subalpine
grasslands are critical vegetation types, yet they cover less than 2% of
the land area (Warren et al., 1982). Plant community composition and
structure in meadows are often dramatically different than in the
surrounding forests, and these meadows provide important habitat for
wildlife, as well as aesthetics and biological diversity. A meadow
opening, for example, will generate four to ﬁve times the herbaceous
production and plant richness of the nearby forest interior (Moore and
Deiter, 1992; Brown, 1994). During the past century, it appears that
conifers and Populus tremuloides (Michx.) species have encroached
upon the meadows and subalpine grasslands in GCNP and through-
out the Southwest, eliminating or reducing the extent of these
critical landscape elements (Brown, 1994). GCNP personnel observed,
‘‘Encroachment appears to be occurring on all meadowlands; however,
in some areas it seems to be occurring at a faster rate’’ (NPS-RFP, 1990).
Recent tree encroachment into montane and subalpine meadows of
western North America is widely reported from the Paciﬁc Northwest
(Franklin et al., 1971; Rochefort and Peterson, 1996; Miller and
Halpern, 1998) to Utah (Ostler et al., 1982) (see also Rochefort et al.,
1994, for review). In contrast to the numerous studies documented in
the Paciﬁc Northwest and northern Rocky Mountains, few studies in the
Southwest have been reported (Allen, 1984, 1989; Dyer and Moffett,
1999). We suggest in this study that Arizona’s unique monsoonal
climate, relatively recent EuroAmerican settlement, and large contro-
versial deer herds from the early 1900s (Leopold, 1943; Russo, 1964)
may yield some interesting tree encroachment patterns.
Casual observations of meadow habitat in northern Arizona
suggest that some meadows may be relatively stable while others are
converting to forest. Several researchers commented on the small trees
near meadow borders while conducting other studies on the Kaibab
Plateau in the 1930s and 1940s (Mead, 1930; McHenry, 1933;
Rasmussen, 1941; Merkle, 1962). For example, Mead (1930) stated,
‘‘. . . in many cases seedlings of Picea pungens occur along the edge of
the
meadow
in
the
open.
This
apparently
does
not
signify
encroachment since usually no trees of intermediate size are found
between the seedling and the mature tree. These seedlings are stunted
and short for their ages.’’ ‘‘In a good many cases [however] it appears
that Populus aurea [now P. tremuloides] advances into the meadow
making way for Picea pungens seedlings. These seedlings are
apparently more healthy and in some cases grow to maturity.’’ Merkle
(1962) noted, ‘‘. . . no isolated young trees are found out in the
meadows, but invasion is suggested by the presence of small trees
along the margin.’’ Pearson (1913) was the ﬁrst to investigate possible
tree invasion of Pinus ponderosa into ‘‘parks’’ near Flagstaff, AZ, and
he concluded that the microclimate in the parks was too severe for tree
establishment and survival. No quantitative study has been conducted
on tree encroachment into meadows in Arizona.
We initiated this study to describe species composition, structure,
and temporal patterns of tree encroachment on the montane meadows
and subalpine grasslands of the North Rim of GCNP. Quantitative
information concerning patterns of encroachment in GCNP will help
park ecologists and natural resource managers formulate management
strategies to conserve meadow habitat that contributes to species and
landscape diversity. Further, such information adds to our scientiﬁc
understanding of an apparently widespread phenomenon in the western
United States.
Study Area
PHYSICAL SETTING
The study was conducted on the North Rim of GCNP, Arizona
(368109N to 368289N, 1118459W to 1128109W) (Fig. 1). The North
Rim is situated between the northern edge of GCNP and the southern
edge of a series of plateaus (primarily the Kaibab and Walhalla), which
eventually drop down to the Colorado River. The Kaibab Plateau is the

largest and highest. The North Rim ranges from ca. 2075 to 2800 m in
elevation.
The general climate of the North Rim is characterized by cold,
snowy winters and mild, moist summers. The only year-round weather
records that exist for the Kaibab Plateau are for the Bright Angel
Ranger Station, which is located near the southern tip of the plateau in
GCNP. Annual precipitation at the Bright Angel Ranger Station
(elevation 2560 m) averaged 65 cm, with a range from 35 cm to 114
cm between 1930 and 1995 (National Climatic Data Center, 2004;
Arizona Weather, 2004). Precipitation distribution is bimodal, with
distinct monsoonal rains from mid-July until September and snowfall
can be heavy with 50–60% of the precipitation falling in the winter
months (December through March). Temperature averages 178C in
July and 38C in January (Green and Sellers, 1964; Sellers et al.,
1985). The average freeze-free period ranges from 93 to 101 days
(from approximately mid-June until mid-September).
A series of elongate topographic depressions and drainage valleys,
which generally trend north to south, are located throughout the Kaibab
and Walhalla Plateaus (Strahler, 1944). Surface streams are absent and
drainage is subsurface, except after snowmelt. These basins and
drainage valleys are grassy and often treeless (called ‘‘parks’’ or
‘‘meadows’’), and contain limestone outcrops and solution sinks. Soils
on upper slopes are well-drained, moderately deep to deep gravelly
loam to clay loam, and formed in residuum and alluvium from limestone
sources—primarily Kaibab and Toroweap Limestone (Robbie, 1980;
Brewer et al., 1984). Soils of meadow bottoms are somewhat poorly
drained, loam or clay loam (Robbie, 1980; Brewer et al., 1984).
The primary tree species on the forest-meadow boundaries
includes Populus tremuloides (Michx.), Picea engelmannii (Parre),
Picea pungens (Engelm.), Pinus ponderosa (Laws.), Abies concolor
(Lindl.), and Abies lasiocarpa (Nutt.) (Warren et al., 1982, White and
Vankat, 1993). Forest understory shrubs include Juniperus communis
(L.) and Berberis repens (Lindl.).
Approximately 1780 ha (between 1% and 2%) of the North Rim’s
vegetation is classiﬁed as meadow (Warren et al., 1982). Hereafter, in
this study, we will use the general term ‘‘meadow’’ to collectively
represent montane meadows, subalpine grasslands, parks, and wood-
land parks.
CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL SETTING
A rich prehistory, aboriginal, Mormon, and EuroAmerican history
surrounds the Kaibab Plateau and North Rim of GCNP. Early land use
and anthropogenic impacts on these forests and meadows undoubtedly
played important roles in shaping contemporary plant community
structure and dynamics.
Recorded history began with Spanish expeditions in the late
1700s on the Kaibab Plateau, and in the nearby remote region from the
Colorado River north to the Utah border known as the Arizona Strip
(Altschul and Fairley, 1989). By the mid-1830s Mexican traders were
traveling regularly through the Arizona Strip region on the Old Spanish
Trail, but did not venture onto the Kaibab Plateau. Altschul and Fairley
(1989) stated, ‘‘During the mid-1800s, the human impact on the Kaibab
Plateau was limited to a declining population of Kaibab Paiutes [due to
European diseases and slavery] and possibly some trappers.’’
Mormon settlers occupied the Arizona Strip in the 1850s and

1860s, but did not begin timber harvesting or livestock grazing (sheep,
cattle, and horses) on the Kaibab Plateau until the early and mid-1870s
(Verkamp, 1940; Rasmussen, 1941; Altschul and Fairley, 1989). The
Kaibab Plateau also experienced additional grazing pressure in the early
1900s (approximately 1915–1930) due to an overabundance of deer
(Mann and Locke, 1931; Rasmussen, 1941). Deer population irruption
was soon followed by a population crash. This story became a classic
(and controversial) story of predator-prey relationships (Leopold, 1943;
Caughley, 1970; Young 2002).
The low-intensity surface ﬁres, which were a common occurrence
in northern Arizona Pinus ponderosa forests and lower elevation
mixed conifer forests prior to the 20th century, ceased in the late 1870s
and early 1880s. Frequent ﬁre regimes were disrupted in forested
highlands of the Arizona Strip as early as 1870 in the Mount Trumbull
area (P.Z. Fule´ et al., unpublished data), about 85 km west of the
Kaibab Plateau, and between 1876 and 1883 near Flagstaff, AZ
(Dieterich, 1980; Fule´ et al., 1997). Wolf and Mast (1998) and Fule´
et al. (2002) report ﬁre regime disruption between 1879 and 1887 at
several locations on the North Rim of GCNP.
Methods
FIELD PROCEDURES
The meadow sites studied varied by size, forest type surrounding
the site, landform, and topographic position (Table 1). Landform or
topographic positions were based on McHenry (1933), who observed
that the North Rim meadows occupied three distinct locations over the
landscape, including the ﬂat ﬂoor of broad shallow valleys, intermediate
stream drainages, and south-facing slopes of drainage valleys. The
intermediate stream drainages (ISD) are relatively abundant, while the
south facing slopes (SFS) and the broad and shallow valleys (BSV) are
few in total number but often large in extent.
We used a 1967 1:62,500 U.S. Geological Survey topographic
quadrangle map to stratify the North Rim of GCNP by elevation from
2400 to 2700 m, which is the elevation range of the meadows. We
identiﬁed 32 ISD, 16 SFS, and 2 BSV. We numbered the meadows
within each category and visited these meadows in the ﬁeld. Over 60%
of the ISD and SFS categories had paved roads, unimproved dirt roads,
or old livestock runways running through the middle of them resulting
in erosion and disturbances that impeded natural tree encroachment.
From the few relatively undisturbed ISD and SFS, we randomly
selected 10 meadow sites to represent the western, central, and eastern
portions of the North Rim. We sampled all meadows from the BSV
category, since there were only two in GCNP (Table 1). The 12 meadow
sites were sampled in the summers of 1992 and 1993.
Transect placement was systematically determined and based off
northern and southern points we identiﬁed for each meadow using maps
and photographs. We relocated these points in the ﬁeld and used a 50-,
100-, or 150-m random start to establish the ﬁrst transect along the
forest-meadow margin. Thereafter, we established transects every 250
m along the margin until we had sampled the entire meadow perimeter.
Transects were then categorized by general aspect, according to their
location along the meadow perimeter: southwest-facing (458), north-
west-facing (1358), northeast-facing (2258), or southeast-facing (3158).
The number of transects established per meadow, therefore, varied with
meadow site, shape, and size; at least two transects were established in
the narrow or very small (1 ha) meadows and up to 15 transects were
established in large (.24 ha) meadows. Sixty-two belt transects were
sampled in total.
After the location of each belt transect was determined, the starting
point was anchored at the tree (mature, sapling, seedling, or sucker) that
was farthest into the meadow interior. Each transect was then
established from meadow interior toward the closed forest for 50 m
perpendicular to the forest-meadow edge (Vale, 1981). All transects
reached the forest edge, and some transects extended beyond into the
closed forest. Each transect length was corrected for slope, if necessary.
The belt transect was 2 m wide. The corners of each plot were
permanently staked with rebar.
All trees encountered within the 50 m 3 2 m belt transects were
measured. Data recorded for each tree included location (x, y; recorded
to the nearest 0.10 m), species, age, condition class (sensu Maser et al.,
1979), total height, and diameter. For this study, we combined the two
Picea species because of the difﬁculty in correctly identifying them in
the seedling stage (up to 1 m tall) (Jones and Bernard, 1977). Diameters
were measured at ground level for seedlings, suckers, and smaller
saplings (5 cm in diameter at ground level). Diameters of larger
saplings (.5 cm in diameter at ground level) and mature trees were
measured at 30 cm.
The ages of trees 5 cm in diameter were indeterminate or
questionable in the ﬁeld and, therefore, were cut with a handsaw at
ground level, and a cross-section was brought to the lab to determine
total age using a binocular microscope. Peters et al. (2002) reported
that ground-level ring counts in young (,10 yr) stands are a reliable
way to identify initial regeneration patterns.
Larger saplings and mature trees were cored at 30 cm above
ground level. Although we recognize the advantages of coring at
ground level, the butt swell and irregular growth at the base of older
trees, and the GCNP personnel concerns about destructive sampling of

older trees, made sampling at ground level an unreasonable choice. The
30 cm coring height was the lowest position on the tree stem we could
use for consistency in aging, given the circumstances. Age-to-coring
height (years to reach 30 cm in this study) was obtained by taking the
average age of seedlings, suckers, or saplings in the 2.54 cm to 61 cm
height category by species, and then adding this estimate to the total
age. Estimates by species were 2, 13, 3, 9, and 19 yr to reach 30 cm
for P. tremuloides, Picea spp., P. ponderosa, A. concolor, and A.
lasiocarpa, respectively. Peters et al. (2002) suggested a 3- to 6-yr
underestimate in age of older (ca. 20–40 yr) stands, even if sampled at
ground level, and especially for shade-tolerant species such as Abies
and some Picea species. To compensate for this problem, our data were
examined for decade-scale patterns of tree establishment by species.
Of the 3481 trees sampled on all belt transects, 766 were dead,
had rotten centers, or had unreadable cores. Therefore, age statistics
were from a sample size of 2715 live trees. Tree density statistics were
from a sample of 2916 live trees.
DATA ANALYSES
Our data analyses were divided into two general parts: (1) general
trends, intended to determine if trees were encroaching upon the
meadows on the North Rim of GCNP, and (2) individual species
patterns, a more speciﬁc examination of species’ structural attributes
and temporal patterns of establishment.
To examine the general trends, we used percentage and descriptive
statistics for a pooled-view of the trees at the forest-meadow borders.
We also divided the 50 m transects into thirds (0–16.6 m, 16.7–33.3 m,
and 33.4–50 m) for analysis of spatial patterns of tree establishment
along transects from meadow interiors toward the closed forest. We
used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test for main effects (p
 0.05) of transect distance on maximum tree age, mean tree density,
maximum tree diameter, and overall mean density of dead woody
material (e.g., standing dead, downed logs, etc.). When main effects
were found, Tukey’s post-hoc test (p  0.05) was used to examine
differences among group means. Chi-squared goodness-of-ﬁt tests, for
individual species and for all species combined, were used to test for
signiﬁcant differences (p  0.10) in number of trees among aspects.
The data were examined further to determine differences in
individual tree species’ structural attributes and temporal patterns of
encroachment. These analyses also used percentages and descriptive
statistics. We used ANOVA to test for main effects (p  0.05) of
distance on individual species’ ages or species’ densities or a combi-
nation of species’ age and density. When main effects were found,
Tukey’s post-hoc test (p  0.05) was used to examine differences
among group means. For all analyses, data were natural-log or square
root transformed to normalize distributions or to obtain homogeneity of
variance when necessary.
Results
GENERAL TRENDS
The majority of trees on the forest-meadow margins were young
and small when data for all species were pooled. Mean tree age was
20 yr (in 1993), and 62% of the trees sampled were less than 20 yr of
age (Fig. 2). Less than 8% of the trees sampled were greater than 53 yr
of age, while only 23 trees (,1%) were greater than 90 yr of age. When
trees were grouped into 10-year age classes, the establishment
distribution had a distinct period between the mid-1800s and 1903
where only 23 trees (ca. 1%) established on the plots (Fig. 2). The
period from 1968 to 1993 had the greatest tree establishment; 71% of
the trees in our study plots established during this period, and of those,
the majority (60%) established during the 1980s (Fig. 2). In addition,
more than 80% of the trees were less than 3 m in height and nearly 90%
were less than 15 cm in basal diameter.
Tree age, density, and size varied with distance along belt
transect. For all species combined, there was a signiﬁcant effect (p ,
0.001) of transect distance on the maximum age of trees (Fig. 3). Trees
that were the farthest into the meadow were signiﬁcantly (p , 0.001)
younger than trees closer to the forest and the middle one-third (p ¼
0.02) of all transects. Likewise, there was a signiﬁcant (p¼ 0.04) effect
of transect distance on the mean number of trees (Fig. 4), where fewer
trees were established farthest into the meadow, and the greatest
number of trees were established in the middle one-third. Tree density
closest to the forest edge was not signiﬁcantly different from the other
two distances. Lastly, for all species combined, there was no signiﬁcant
effect of transect distance on mean tree size (Fig. 5).
The age data were divided into 30-yr age classes and tree density
by age class as a function of transect distance yielded some interesting

results (Fig. 6). As expected, the older age classes (61–90 yr and 90þyr)
had a greater tree density toward the forested end of the transects, and
gradually tapered off out into the meadow. Tree densities for the
younger age classes (1–30 yr and 31–60 yr), however, did not differ
with transect distance.
Sixty-seven percent of trees sampled were live and in the healthy
condition class. However, many of the younger trees appeared stressed
from seasonal drought, disease, browsing, and fossorial animals
(Moore, personal observation), which Moir et al. (1999) suggest are
local controls on tree encroachment. This observation is supported
further by our data. Approximately 33% of the tree seedlings and
suckers were either declining or dead. The amount of smaller standing
dead material (5 cm; seedlings, young suckers, small saplings) was
signiﬁcantly greater (p ¼ 0.04) than that of larger standing or downed
material at all three transect distances (Fig. 7). Of the 3481 total trees
(live and dead) sampled, 35 (ca. 1%) were classiﬁed as dead and down
logs. Nearly half (17) of these logs were found on 3 of the 62 transects,
while the majority (68%) of transects were completely devoid of large
down woody material (Fig. 7).
The majority (62%) of encroaching trees occurred on the north-
facing aspects (Table 2), although tree density by aspect was not
statistically signiﬁcant. More speciﬁcally, 22% of all trees occurred on
SW-facing aspects (458), 35% occurred on NW-facing aspects (1358),
27% occurred on NE-facing aspects (2258), and 16% occurred on SE-
facing aspects (3158). This general trend is consistent with other studies
that found greater tree encroachment (and greater tree densities) on
northerly aspects, and is attributed to a longer retention of snow and
greater soil moisture (Rochefort et al., 1994; Moir et al., 1999).
These results, in combination with age data and analysis of dead
structures, indicate that the contemporary meadow edges on the North
Rim were essentially devoid of trees in the late 1800s and early 1900s.
By the 1940s, however, an average of 300 trees ha1 established, and
by 1993 there were an average of 4703 trees ha1. A large proportion
of the trees established in 1992–1993 were aspen suckers, and, many of
these will not likely survive to maturity because seedling and sucker
mortality is typically high (Schier et al., 1985).
INDIVIDUAL TREE SPECIES PATTERNS
Of the 3481 live and dead trees sampled, 52% of all trees on the
transects were Populus tremuloides, 20% were Picea spp., 7% were
Pinus
ponderosa,
10%
were
Abies
concolor,
and
11%
were
Abies lasiocarpa.
We also examined the maximum tree age (Fig. 8) and the mean
tree density (Fig. 9) along each transect by individual tree species. Pinus
ponderosa and Picea species both demonstrated a signiﬁcant effect
(ANOVA; p , 0.05) of transect distance on the maximum age. Pinus
and Picea trees that were the farthest into the meadow were signiﬁcantly
(Tukey post-hoc; p ¼ 0.008–0.02) younger than trees closer to the
forest. The middle one-third of all transects were not signiﬁcantly
different from the meadow or forested ends for either species,
suggesting a gradual progression of these tree species into the meadow.
Populus tremuloides, Abies concolor, and Abies lasiocarpa, however,
did not demonstrate a signiﬁcant effect of transect on maximum age.
There was no signiﬁcant effect (p . 0.05) of transect distance on the
mean number of trees (Fig. 9) for any species.
When number of trees was plotted against establishment date for
individual species, details of regeneration and stand structure patterns
became apparent (Fig. 10). Populus tremuloides age structure was
a distinct ‘‘inverse-J’’ shaped curve, which is indicative of an uneven-
aged distribution dominated by young trees (Nyland, 1996). P.
tremuloides established on some transects as early as 1850 (Fig. 10),
and the mean establishment date was 1983–1984. The majority (90%)
of P. tremuloides regeneration occurred relatively recently between

signiﬁcant effect of distance (ANOVA; p . 0.05) was detected.

Values are means and standard errors. Similar letters within distance
classes denote statistically similar means (Tukey post-hoc; p . 0.05).
Signiﬁcant differences (Tukey post-hoc; p , 0.001) between mean
dead seedlings/suckers and means of other dead structures within each
distance class were found. No signiﬁcant difference existed between
seedlings/suckers across distance classes; however, mean standing
dead .5.0 cm diameter in distance classes 16.7–33.3 m and 33.4–50.0
m were signiﬁcantly greater (ANOVA; p¼0.04 main effect of distance)
than mean standing dead .5.0 cm in distance class 0–16.6 m (Tukey
post-hoc, p , 0.05). Similarly, mean dead and down in distance class
16.7–33.3 m was signiﬁcantly greater (ANOVA; p¼0.01 main effect of
distance) than dead and down means in 0–16.6 m and 33.4–50 m, both
of which were similar (Tukey post-hoc, p , 0.05). Mean stump density

1973 and 1993. Substantial mortality may eventually occur on the sites,
however, because over 50% of the P. tremuloides suckers in our study
were classiﬁed in a ‘‘declining’’ condition. Schier et al. (1985) noted
that P. tremuloides is an early successional species and can produce
abundant vegetative suckers from roots, yet many of these die within
the ﬁrst 5 yr.
Picea species established as early as 1859 (Fig. 10) with a mean
establishment date of 1960–1961. The Picea species’ age distribution,
and therefore establishment, was rather consistent in the last 80 yr
(1913–1993).
Pinus ponderosa represented the oldest trees on the forest-
meadow borders (10 older than 113 yr; Fig. 10), with a mean
establishment date of 1948–1949. This species established as early as
1780, with scattered individuals establishing on the drier and generally
lower
elevation
meadows
(primarily
Walhalla
Plateau
site)
or
southwest-facing aspects (primarily the Basin site), almost every
decade until the early 1880s. Maximum age observed for P. ponderosa
was 78, 164, and 180 yr of age on transect thirds from meadow interior
toward closed forest, respectively. These older trees, located 25 m to
50 m or more from the contemporary meadow edge, may be useful
indicators of the forest-meadow boundary that existed in the late 1800s
and early 1900s (McHenry, 1933). Since the early 1900s, there has
been an increase in P. ponderosa establishment, with a peak between
1943 and 1953. We did not see, however, the large 1919 P. ponderosa
regeneration event described by Savage et al. (1996) for other parts of
Arizona. P. ponderosa establishment was minimal on these meadows
from 1963 until 1993.
Abies concolor ﬁrst established on these transects around 1925,
and gradually increased until 1993 (Fig. 10). The mean establishment
date was 1975–1976. A. concolor tree density nearly doubled from
1973 to 1993. A. lasiocarpa initially established on the mesic and
higher elevation transects around 1902 (Fig. 10) with a mean date of
establishment 1967–1968. In general, A. lasiocarpa numbers in-
creased, with a noticeable pulse of establishment between 1933 and
1943, and then a more recent pulse between 1963 and 1983. A.
lasiocarpa establishment slowed between 1983 and 1993.
DISCUSSION
During the past century, conifers and Populus tremuloides
(Michx.) have invaded montane meadows and subalpine grasslands
within the North Rim of GCNP. The tree age structure and general
pattern of progressively younger trees from the closed forest toward
the meadow interiors, together with little evidence of historical tree
occurrence (e.g., large standing dead, downed logs, etc.) on the
transects, indicate that trees have been encroaching on these meadows
since the early 1900s. Tree encroachment and increased tree density of
contemporary forest-meadow boundaries occurred to some extent since
the mid-1800s, however, the encroachment has increased steadily since
the 1930s and 1940s, with the greatest numbers of trees occurring
during the 1980s. These results conﬁrm the casual observations of early
scientists who commented on the presence of small trees (Picea
pungens and Populus tremuloides in particular) along the North Rim
meadow margins in the 1930s through the 1950s (Mead, 1930;
McHenry, 1933; Rasmussen, 1941; Merkle, 1962; see also photo pair in
Fig. 11 located 1.8 km north of the Upper Little Park study site).
Further, our data suggest that the meadow-forest boundaries are
dynamic and may change over relatively short or long time periods
(Rochefort et al., 1994; Miller and Halpern, 1998). And, ﬁnally the
recent tree encroachment we describe for the meadows of GCNP is
consistent with a widespread phenomenon observed in meadow areas
across the western United States (Franklin et al., 1971; Ostler et al.,
1982; Rochefort et al., 1994; Rochefort and Peterson, 1996; Miller and
Halpern, 1998).
The pattern of tree encroachment on the North Rim differed with
species. Trees establishing in the 1800s on the forest-meadow borders
were Pinus ponderosa in the lower elevation sites and drier south-
facing aspects of the higher elevations, Picea species in the higher
elevation sites and mesic north-facing aspects of lower sites, and
Populus tremuloides on all sites. Pinus and Picea species steadily
invaded the North Rim meadows beginning approximately 1900, but in
low numbers. Populus tremuloides exhibited low recruitment from the
early 1900s until the 1950s, and then over a more recent 20–25 yr
period (1968–1993) has made substantial advances into neighboring
meadow habitat and contributed disproportionately to increasing tree
densities relative to the other species. Abies concolor and A. lasiocarpa
occurred on the meadow edges in the 1930s, but not in great numbers
until more recently. Abies spp. increased gradually from 1943 to 1993.
Pinus ponderosa and Picea species appeared to follow a more
‘‘linear’’ model of tree encroachment, with older trees in or near the
closed forest and younger trees farther out into the meadow interior. In
contrast, Populus tremuloides and Abies spp. did not invade in a linear
fashion, but contributed to tree encroachment by increasing tree

densities and ﬁlling in space around existing trees, a pattern noted by
other researchers (Franklin et al., 1971; Rochefort and Peterson, 1996).
White and Vankat (1993) suggested that Pinus ponderosa and Picea
species create favorable microsite conditions for the shade-tolerant
Abies concolor and Abies lasiocarpa to establish.
Relationships of tree species’ establishment patterns with respect
to speciﬁc microsite conditions or landscape factors, such as historical
and current climatic patterns, ﬁre exclusion, livestock, and native
ungulate herbivory has been examined by numerous researchers at other
locations in the western United States (Franklin et al., 1971; Dunwiddie,
1977; Jakubos and Romme, 1993; Rochefort et al., 1994; Rochefort and
Peterson, 1996; Miller and Halpern, 1998; Moir et al., 1999). Although
examination of causal factors was beyond the scope of this study, as
with the studies cited above, the factors driving tree encroachment on
the meadows of the North Rim of GCNP are likely operating at several
scales (White and Vankat, 1993; Miller and Halpern, 1998). Further, the
many possible landscape-scale mechanisms such as climate change, ﬁre
exclusion, and ungulate herbivory are confounded. For example, the
end of the Little Ice Age (ca. 1850), which brought about a warmer and
wetter climate in the Rocky Mountains and Southwest (Lamb, 1977),
has been cited as the trigger for Pinus contorta invasion of meadows in
Yellowstone National Park (Jakubos and Romme, 1993), Picea-Abies
encroachment on forest-tundra ecotone in Colorado (Hessl and Baker,
1997) and subalpine meadows of south central New Mexico (Dyer and
Moffett, 1999). In our study, however, the period from the mid 1850s
through the early 1900s did not see a large amount of tree en-
croachment, although it may have contributed to the few Pinus and
Picea individuals that established during that time. On our sites, the
period from 1968 to 1993 had the greatest tree establishment (especially
Populus tremuloides), with a peak during the 1980s. Climate may have
been a possible forcing factor in tree invasion during this time, because
the period from 1983 to 1988 was an extremely wet one in northern
Arizona (Salzar, 2000).
Fire regime disruption occurred around 1879 on the North Rim of
GCNP (Wolf and Mast, 1998; Fule´ et al., 2002), and our data show
some initial establishment of Pinus ponderosa, Picea species, and
Populus tremuloides near this time. Similarly, Merkle (1954) and Fule´
et al. (2002) suggest that the high-intensity crown ﬁres, which occurred

in the higher Picea-Abies forest type in the mid-1800s in GCNP, were
most likely the origin of Populus tremuloides stands that dated to the
middle and late 1800s.
Another factor often cited as a trigger in tree encroachment is
release from domestic or native ungulate browsing. In the early and
mid-1870s, Mormon settlers began using the Kaibab Plateau as summer
range for livestock (sheep, cattle, horses), and for 20–30 yr grazing was
intense (Mann and Locke, 1931; Rasmussen, 1941; Mitchell and
Freeman, 1993). The livestock numbers decreased dramatically at the
turn of the 20th century because of a severe 10-yr drought (1894–1904)
(D’Arrigo and Jacoby, 1991; Mitchell and Freeman, 1993; Grissino-
Mayer and Swetnam 2000; Salzar 2000). Surprisingly, our data do not
show a large amount of tree encroachment during the early 1900s as you
might expect after release from livestock herbivory, although other
studies have shown that livestock, especially sheep, effectively slow
tree establishment, and then subsequently cause increases in tree
invasion when animals are removed (Dunwiddie, 1977; Vankat and
Major, 1978; Vale, 1981; Allen, 1989; Savage and Swetnam, 1990;
Miller and Halpern, 1998).
Our data do suggest, however, a release of Populus tremuloides in
the late 1940s and 1950s. This release appears to coincide with
a reduction of large deer herds that occurred on the North Rim between
1915 until the early 1950s (Mann and Locke, 1931; Rasmussen, 1941;
Leopold, 1943; Merkle, 1962; Russo, 1964). Deer apparently were
rarely seen using the meadows and parks on the Kaibab Plateau until
about 1916, when they began to appear in large numbers (Rasmussen,
1941). In 1935, McHenry stated that very few P. tremuloides trees were
under 20 yr of age in GCNP. Merkle (1962) determined that size
distribution was irregular in the P. tremuloides of the North Rim with
almost complete absence in intermediate sizes (2 to 25 ft), which he
assumed was due to the intense browsing by deer that began in the early
1920s and continued into the 1950s. Romme et al. (1995), White et al.
(1998), Ripple and Larsen (2000), and Binkley et al. in (in press) also
suggest that large ungulate herds, together with alteration of historical
ﬁre regimes and predator/prey relationships, have affected successful P.
tremuloides recruitment in several national parks and other areas in the
Rocky Mountains of the western United States.
Conclusions
Tree establishment patterns varied with tree species and size and
type of meadow on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park
during the past century. On meadow sites where the soils are extremely
rocky or gravelly (Mead, 1930, McHenry, 1933) or remain saturated
during the growing season, or where severe frost pockets exist (Moir
et al., 1999), trees will have difﬁculty establishing. Mead (1930) and
Merkle (1962) suggested that the high elevation subalpine meadows
will persist indeﬁnitely without invasion of trees from the adjacent
forest because the high soil moisture levels in spring cause seeds to rot,
while scalding surface temperatures and very dry soil in early summer
kill any tree seedlings that manage to germinate. Although these harsh
conditions exist on the higher elevation broad valley meadows of
the North Rim (McHenry, 1933), our data show signiﬁcant tree
establishment on these sites. In contrast, where meadows are small (1
ha) or long and narrow in shape, such as the intermediate stream
drainages, it is possible that these meadows could be completely
replaced by forest vegetation within the next several decades. Meadow
size on the North Rim appears to have decreased since the mid-1930s,
but most dramatically since the 1970s and 1980s. These results suggest
at least a temporary loss of important meadow habitat and landscape
biodiversity within Grand Canyon National Park.
