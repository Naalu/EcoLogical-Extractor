Summary
1. Biological invasion can permanently alter ecosystem structure and function. In-
vasive species are difﬁcult to eradicate, so methods for constraining invasions would be
ecologically valuable. We examined the potential of ecological restoration to constrain
invasion of an old ﬁeld by Agropyron cristatum, an introduced C3 grass.
2. A ﬁeld experiment was conducted in the northern Great Plains of North America.
One-hundred and forty restored plots were planted in 1994–96 with a mixture of C3 and
C4 native grass seed, while 100 unrestored plots were not. Vegetation on the plots was
measured periodically between 1994 and 2002.
3. Agropyron cristatum invaded the old ﬁeld between 1994 and 2002, occurring in 5% of
plots in 1994 and 66% of plots in 2002, and increasing in mean cover from 0·2% in 1994
to 17·1% in 2002. However, A. cristatum invaded one-third fewer restored than unrestored
plots between 1997 and 2002, suggesting that restoration constrained invasion. Further,
A. cristatum cover in restored plots decreased with increasing planted grass cover. Stepwise
regression indicated that A. cristatum cover was more strongly correlated with planted
grass cover than with distance from the A. cristatum source, species richness, percentage
bare ground or percentage litter.
4. The strength of the negative relationship between A. cristatum and planted native
grasses varied among functional groups: the correlation was stronger with species with
phenology and physiology similar to A. cristatum (i.e. C3 grasses) than with dissimilar
species (C4 grasses).
5. Richness and cover of naturally establishing native species decreased with increasing
A. cristatum cover. In contrast, restoration had little effect on the establishment and
colonization of naturally establishing native species. Thus, A. cristatum hindered
colonization by native species while planted native grasses did not.
6. Synthesis and applications. To our knowledge, this study provides the ﬁrst indication
that restoration can act as a ﬁlter, constraining invasive species while allowing colon-
ization by native species. These results suggest that resistance to invasion depends on the
identity of species in the community and that restoration seed mixes might be tailored
to constrain selected invaders. Restoring areas before invasive species become estab-
lished can reduce the magnitude of biological invasion.

Introduction
Biological invasion can produce profound and irreversible
changes to ecosystem structure and function (Mooney &
Hobbs 2000; Sakai et al. 2001). Agropyron cristatum (L.)
Gaertn., a perennial C3 grass, is a model species illustrating
these effects. Introduced to North America in the early 1900s,
A. cristatum now dominates 13–17 million ha of semi-arid
grassland on the continent (Heidinga & Wilson 2002).
Stands dominated by A. cristatum contain 35% lower species
richness (Heidinga & Wilson 2002) and 25% less soil carbon
(Christian & Wilson 1999) than native grassland.

Invasive species are difﬁcult to eradicate once estab-
lished (Benz et al. 1999; Manchester & Bullock 2000;
Wilson 2002; Price & Weltzin 2003). Methods of pre-
venting or constraining their spread have been difﬁcult
to develop (Keane & Crawley 2002; Perry & Galatowitsch
2003; Perry, Galatowitsch & Rosen 2004) but would be
ecologically valuable. Our objective was to explore the
potential of ecological restoration to constrain the
spread of invasive species in old ﬁelds. Ecological
restoration is ‘the process of assisting the recovery of
an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or
destroyed’ (SER 2002) and often involves the planting
of native species associated with later successional
stages. Negative correlations between abundances of
native and introduced species (Anderson & Inouye
2001; Heidinga & Wilson 2002) suggest that invasion
by A. cristatum could be reduced if old ﬁelds were
planted with native perennial grasses from later succes-
sional stages.
Agropyron cristatum alters the successional trajectories
of ecosystems where it is established: old ﬁelds sown
with A. cristatum half a century ago remain domin-
ated by this species, whereas unsown old ﬁelds now
resemble native grassland (Christian & Wilson 1999).
Preferred management actions to constrain invasion
by A. cristatum should have minimal effects on other
species. We assessed this by examining the effects of
invasion and restoration on the species richness and
cover of naturally establishing (non-planted) native
species.
Interspeciﬁc differences in resource use and other
traits suggest that native species should differ in their
effectiveness in constraining invasion. Differences are
likely to be most pronounced among functional groups
(species with similar phenologies and physiologies). In
general, established (resident) vegetation should have
a stronger inhibitory effect on invading species from
the same functional group than on species from other
functional groups (Fargione, Brown & Tilman 2003).
We hypothesized that effectiveness in constraining
invasion by A. cristatum would differ among functional
groups and would be greater in restored vegetation from
the same functional group as A. cristatum (C3 grasses)
than in restored vegetation from another functional
group (C4 grasses).
We also examined the relative importance of bio-
tic- and dispersal-related variables to the spread of
A. cristatum. Variables thought to be potentially impor-
tant included cover of planted grasses, percentage bare
ground, percentage litter, species richness, distance
from the A. cristatum source and distance parallel to
the prevailing wind. Here we report on a 9-year ﬁeld
experiment that examined these factors.
Materials and methods
We studied an old ﬁeld in Grasslands National Park,
Saskatchewan, Canada (49°11′N 107°43′W). The ﬁeld
was cultivated for more than 30 years and abandoned
in 1984. A roadside 20 m south of the experiment was
dominated by a well-established stand of A. cristatum
when our experiment began in 1994. Wilson et al. (2004)
provide details of the experimental design and describe
native grass establishment through to 1997. We exam-
ined invasion of the experiment by A. cristatum between
1994 and 2002. Two-hundred and forty plots, each
3 × 10 m, were randomly assigned to treatments. One-
hundred and forty plots were planted and are referred
to as restored plots; the remaining 100 plots were not
planted and are referred to as unrestored plots. Restored
plots were planted by broadcasting or drilling seed of a
mixture of native grasses (Bouteloua gracilis, Hesper-
ostipa comata, Koeleria macrantha, Elymus lanceolatus
and Pascopyrum smithii) or by spreading seed cleanings
(biomass remaining after processing to remove awns
from Hesperostipa comata seed) that contained seeds
of several native species. Bouteloua gracilis has a C4
photosynthetic pathway; the other planted grass species
have C3 photosynthetic pathways. Nomenclature follows
USDA, NRCS (2004).
Plant cover was measured annually during 1994–97
and again in 2002. All measurements were made in the
centre 0·5 × 1 m of each plot. For each species, we esti-
mated cover using Daubenmire’s (1959) cover classes,
with the addition of a 0–1% class to more accurately
estimate the cover of small and infrequent species.
We used contingency analysis to determine whether
the rate of invasion by A. cristatum differed between
restored and unrestored plots. We restricted our focus
in this analysis to invasion between 1997 and 2002 so
that native grasses had at least 2 years to establish
before invasion. The contingency analysis compared
the restored and unrestored plots with respect to the
proportion of plots where A. cristatum was absent in
1997 but present in 2002.
Next, we focused on the restored plots in 2002 and
used regression to examine the relationship between
A. cristatum cover and several biotic and dispersal-
related variables: cover of planted grasses, species
richness, percentage bare ground, percentage litter, dis-
tance from the A. cristatum source and distance east in
the site (the prevailing wind is from the west). Species
cover and richness were included because they are
likely to vary with the abundance of an invader (Anderson
& Inouye 2001). Bare ground and litter were included
as variables that might affect seedling establishment.
Cover values were arcsin (square-root x) transformed
and richness data were log (x + 1) transformed for
analysis; statistics were back-transformed for pres-
entation. Plots with zero values for both variables were
omitted from analyses. We then used stepwise regres-
sion to assess the relative importance of variables.
Variables were included in the model if P ≤ 0·05 and
removed if P > 0·10. Standard coefﬁcients were used to
make comparisons among variables included in the
stepwise regression.
To test whether the response of A. cristatum cover
varied with functional group identity, we followed the

regression of A. cristatum cover against planted grass
cover with separate regressions of A. cristatum cover
against cover of planted C3 grasses and against cover
of planted C4 grasses.
We also tested the correlations between the cover of
naturally establishing (i.e. non-planted) native species
and the covers of A. cristatum and planted native spe-
cies. This analysis was repeated for richness of naturally
establishing species.
Results

Agropyron cristatum occurred in 5% of plots in 1994, 34%
in 1997 and 66% in 2002. Mean cover of A. cristatum
was 0·2% in 1994, 2·2% in 1997 and 17·1% in 2002. As
A. cristatum invaded the plots over the course of the
experiment, differences in its presence and abundance
among treatments reﬂected differences in its ability to
invade treatments. Invasion during 1997–2002, after
native grasses had established, was signiﬁcantly lower
in restored plots (28% of plots invaded) than in un-
restored plots (42% of plots invaded; Z = 2·27, P = 0·011).
Thus, restoration reduced the spread of A. cristatum by
one-third. Agropyron cristatum cover ranged from 0 to
100% of the total plant cover in individual plots in 2002.

Accompanying the spread of A. cristatum between
1994 and 2002 were additional changes indicating a
transition in dominance from ruderal to perennial
species. Two annual forbs, Kochia scoparia and Conyza
canadensis, accounted for > 50% of the plant cover in
1994 in both restored and unrestored plots (Table 1).
By 1997, Kochia scoparia was absent from the plots,
Conyza canadensis accounted for < 3% of the plant
cover and plots were dominated by Elymus lanceolatus,
other planted native grasses (restored plots only),
A. cristatum, Lactuca serriola, Tragopogon dubius and
Hordeum jubatum. Of these species, only planted native
grasses and A. cristatum remained abundant in 2002.
In restored plots, perennial grasses increased dra-
matically in importance. The proportion of plant cover
attributable to grasses increased from 8·5% in 1994 to
79·2% in 2002 (Fig. 1). Planted native grasses, particu-
larly Elymus lanceolatus, Bouteloua gracilis and Koe-
leria macrantha, comprised > 40% of the plant cover in
restored plots in 2002 (Table 1). Restoration success
varied among plots: cover of planted native grasses
in 2002 ranged from 0 to 100% of total plant cover in
restored plots.
Agropyron cristatum was the most abundant species
in unrestored plots in 2002, but grasses as a whole were
less prevalent than in restored plots: the proportion of
plant cover attributable to grasses increased from 6·0%
in 1994 to 44·0% in 2002 (Fig. 1). Short-lived perennial
forbs such as Taraxacum ofﬁcinale and Medicago sativa
were the next most abundant species in these plots,
followed by Elymus lanceolatus (Table 1).

In restored plots in 2002, cover of Agropyron cristatum
decreased signiﬁcantly with increasing total cover of
planted native grasses (Fig. 2a). A. cristatum cover was
more strongly negatively correlated with planted C3 grass
cover than with planted C4 grass cover (Fig. 2b,c), indi-
cating that functional groups differed in their ability to
resist A. cristatum invasion.

parallel to the prevailing winds (F1,138 = 2·57, P = 0·111;
data not shown). Agropyron cristatum cover was neg-
atively correlated with species richness (F1,138 = 33·58,
P < 0·0001; data not shown), negatively correlated with
percentage bare ground (F1,135 = 3·96, P = 0·049; data
not shown) and positively correlated with percentage
litter (F1,138 = 7·87, P = 0·006; data not shown). However,
stepwise regression indicated that neither dispersal
nor biotic-related variables were included in the best-
ﬁtting model.
The best-ﬁtting stepwise model (r2 = 0·66, F2,134 =
128·33, P < 0·0001) indicated that A. cristatum cover
was negatively correlated with planted grass cover and
percentage bare ground. The standardized coefﬁcient
for planted grass cover (−0·798) was more than three
times as large as that for percentage bare ground
(−0·258), showing that planted grass cover explained
more of the variation in A. cristatum cover than any
other variable.
Both functional groups were signiﬁcantly correlated
with A. cristatum cover when total planted grass cover
was removed and planted C3 grass cover and planted C4
grass cover were included as potential variables in the
stepwise regression. In this case, the best ﬁtting step-
wise model explained the same amount of variation
(r2 = 0·67, F3,117 = 90·46, P < 0·0001) and indicated that
A. cristatum cover was negatively correlated with
planted C3 grass cover, planted C4 grass cover and per-
centage bare ground (standardized coefﬁcients −0·763,
−0·357 and −0·253, respectively). Thus, planted C3
grass cover explained more of the variation in A. cristatum
cover than any other variable.

Total cover of naturally establishing native species was
negatively correlated with A. cristatum cover (Fig. 3a)
but did not vary signiﬁcantly with planted grass cover
(Fig. 3b). Species richness of naturally establishing
native species was negatively correlated with A. cristatum
cover (Fig. 3c) and with planted grass cover (Fig. 3d).
However, the regression with A. cristatum explained
much more of the variation in species richness than the
regression with planted grass cover (r2 = 0·26 and 0·07,
respectively; Fig. 3c,d). Also, the slope of the best-ﬁt line
was steeper with A. cristatum cover than with planted
grass cover as the independent variable.
Discussion
Ecological restoration is well-recognized for its bene-
ﬁcial effects with respect to soil stabilization, wildlife
habitat and biodiversity. Our study suggests that another
beneﬁt of ecological restoration is that it can constrain
biological invasion. While other studies have shown
that ecological restoration can reduce the prevalence
of established invasive species (Benz et al. 1999; Price
& Weltzin 2003), this is the ﬁrst study showing that
ecological restoration reduces the spread of an invasive
species while permitting native species to establish.
Our analysis of invasion by A. cristatum was restricted
to the period 1997–2002, after native grasses had had
at least 2 years to establish. This allowed us to examine
the invasion of A. cristatum into established stands of
native species. While the pre-emptive establishment of
native species may not be possible in all restorations,
our results indicate that early establishment of native
species can reduce future invasions.
By 2002, grass cover in the restored plots (Fig. 1)
approached that of undisturbed prairie (> 80%;
Coupland 1950). Bouteloua gracilis dominated the
restored plots in the years immediately following planting
(Wilson et al. 2004) but by 2002 was replaced by Elymus
lanceolatus as the dominant planted grass. Elymus lan-
ceolatus was absent from plots at the beginning of the
experiment but by 2002 was spreading from restored
into unrestored plots (Table 1).
Classical explanations of invasion rely on distance
and dispersal vectors (Moody & Mack 1988). Stepwise
regression indicated that these variables were not
signiﬁcant when planted grass covers were included
as explanatory variables. Further, the F-value for the
simple regression involving distance from the A. cristatum
seed source was less than one-tenth the size of that for
the regression with planted grass cover (F = 16 and

cover (a, c) and total cover of planted native grasses (b, d). Point size is proportional to the number of plots with that combination of
values (small, 1–5; medium, 6–10; large, >10 plots). Cover data were arcsin square-root transformed and species richness data were
log(x + 1) transformed for analysis; regression equations and lines were back-transformed to the original scale for presentation.

206, respectively). Presumably, the planted native
species constrain invasion by pre-empting space and
resources; biological pre-emption had a much greater
negative effect on A. cristatum than dispersal-related vari-
ables did. These results suggest that ecological restora-
tion may be able to override classical invasion factors.
Other ﬁeld experiments suggest that invasibility
is negatively correlated with diversity (van Ruijven,
De Deyn & Berendse 2003). In this study, however, A.
cristatum cover was much more strongly negatively
correlated with planted grass cover (r 2 = 0·599; Fig. 2a)
than with species richness (r 2 = 0·196). This suggests
that resistance to invasion is not simply a linear func-
tion of species richness: species differ in how effective
they are at constraining invasion. In particular, com-
parisons among functional groups (Fig. 2b,c) suggest
that species from the same functional group (i.e. with
similar phenology and physiology) will be more effec-
tive than dissimilar species at constraining an invasive
species. This supports the idea that successful invaders
replace native species in their niches rather than invad-
ing empty niches (Shea & Chesson 2002). This further
implies that restoration seed mixes can be tailored to
constrain selected invaders.
Restoration seed mixes cannot contain all species,
however, so colonization by naturally establishing native
species is necessary. Ideally, this colonization should
not be hindered by the presence of the planted species.
This was the case here, because the planted native
grasses had little effect on the cover or richness of
naturally establishing native species (Fig. 3b,d). Thus,
ecological restoration functioned as a ﬁlter that allowed
native species to establish at this site while reducing the
spread of an invasive species. Restoration therefore can
help address this most difﬁcult aspect of invasion
management (Keane & Crawley 2002).
Restoration success, as measured by planted grass
cover, varied greatly among plots. The inverse relation-
ship between restoration success and A. cristatum (Fig. 2)
explains why A. cristatum had a high mean cover in
restored plots (Table 1). The restored plots were located
within an old ﬁeld that, apart from our experimental
plots, was not planted with native grasses. Restoration
of larger contiguous areas might further constrain
invasion by A. cristatum. However, optimal restoration
methods vary temporally and at larger spatial scales
(i.e. among sites) (Bakker et al. 2003; Wilson et al.
2004). Methods that are effective in one habitat may be
less effective elsewhere.
As noted above, A. cristatum was present in restored
plots, although at lower levels than in unrestored plots.
Elimination of established A. cristatum plants requires
intense management strategies aimed at halting seed
production (Ambrose & Wilson 2003). The optimal
management methods for an invasive species should
capitalize on unique life-history characteristics of the
species. For example, we have utilized the early growth
and tall growth form of A. cristatum to apply systemic
herbicide in a manner that kills it without affecting the
rest of the plant community (Bakker et al. 2003).
Optimal management methods may also vary among
habitats (Sheppard et al. 2002).
Because little is known of competitive relationships
among native and introduced long-lived perennial spe-
cies (Pyke & Archer 1991; Bakker & Wilson 2001), we
need to determine how to maximize invader control.
Topics such as the optimal establishment density of
planted grasses and long-term population dynamics of
native and invasive species demand attention. Other
areas of concern include the eradication of established
introduced species (Bakker et al. 2003) and the preven-
tion of invasion into undisturbed systems (Heidinga &
Wilson 2002). Experiments should be conducted in
other ecosystems and with other invasive species and
functional groups to assess the generality of the rela-
tionship between restoration and invasion described
here.
