Abstract
Questions: How did an initial tree harvest in 1894 inﬂ uence 
the spatial and temporal patterns of Pinus ponderosa recruit-
ment? How do these patterns compare to our understanding 
of P. ponderosa stand dynamics prior to Euro-American set-
tlement? How might spatial pattern information, particularly 
with respect to patch characteristics, inform current restoration 
and management practices?
Location: A 2.59-ha permanent sample plot in the Fort Valley 
Experimental Forest, Flagstaff, Arizona. The plot was selec-
tively harvested in 1894 and measured in 1909 and 2002.
Methods: We used historical stem-map and ledger data, 
contemporary data, and dendrochronological techniques to 
reconstruct stand structure (tree size, age, location) in three 
scenarios: (1) unharvested (1909), (2) harvested (1909), 
and (3) contemporary (2002). We used Clark and Evans’ R, 
Ripley’s K(t) univariate analysis, and correlogram analysis 
to assess the spatial pattern in each scenario. We also used 
Ripley’s K12(t) bivariate analysis and tree age data to examine 
spatial and temporal recruitment patterns as observed in the 
contemporary scenario.
Results and Conclusions: The unharvested stand was aggre-
gated at scales up to 28 m. The selective harvest accentuated 
the spatial patchiness of the stand in 1909 and changed spatial 
patterns by homogenizing tree size within patches. By 2002, 
the stand was a single patch dominated by small trees. Post-
harvest recruitment patterns were not spatially random; Pinus 
seedlings initially established in natural grass openings and 
then proceeded to ﬁ ll-in stump patches created by harvesting. 
Knowledge of spatial pattern should be explicitly incorporated 
into restoration activities in these forests.

Introduction
Plant spatial patterns observed today are the net result 
of interactions among prior processes such as regenera-
tion, competition, and mortality (Dale 1999; Youngblood 
et al. 2004). Analyses of changes in spatial pattern can 
increase our understanding of plant community dynam-
ics (Levin 1992; Dale 1999; Fortin & Dale 2005) and 
the consequences of management activities such as ﬁ re 
exclusion, grazing, and thinning (Foster et al. 2003) on 
these processes. Thus, analyses of spatial patterns could 
increase our ability to understand and predict future 
stand development.
Much has been written about the dramatic structural 
and functional changes that Pinus ponderosa var. scopu-
lorum) forests of the southwestern United States have 
undergone since Euro-American settlement (Covington 
& Moore 1994; Fulé et al. 1997; Mast et al. 1999, Allen 
et al. 2002; Moore et al. 2004), but few studies have fo-
cused on spatial patterns. Furthermore, tree spatial data 
deemed essential for understanding heterogeneity in con-
temporary and historical stand structures (Youngblood 
et al. 2004; Boyden et al. 2005) are often inadequate or 
lacking. A review of the literature revealed three stud-
ies (Cooper 1960; White 1985; Biondi et al. 1994) that 
quantiﬁ ed spatial patterns in southwestern P. ponderosa 
forests, while four other studies examined P. ponderosa 
spatial patterns in other regions of the United States 
(Mast & Veblen 1999; Harrod et al. 1999; Youngblood 
et al. 2004; Boyden et al. 2005).
The dramatic structural changes in these forests sug-
gest that the underlying processes may also have changed 
over time. For example, presettlement tree seedlings 
likely concentrated in and around the established tree 
patches because frequent surface ﬁ res, grass competition, 
and drought greatly reduced the likelihood of seedling 
establishment elsewhere. Mortality of individual trees 
may have produced small recruitment sites, and frequent 
surface ﬁ res would have acted as a thinning agent on the 
pine seedling patches, most likely resulting in small,

uneven-aged groups of trees or patches (White 1985; Fulé 
et al. 2002; Stephens & Fry 2005). In comparison, post-
settlement stand development has been highly affected 
by the lack of surface ﬁ res, and is generally thought to 
follow a ‘gap’ model (Watt 1947; Stephens & Fry 2005) 
where even-aged patches of seedlings originate in forest 
openings created by disturbance (Cooper 1960, 1961; 
White 1985; Fulé et al. 2002). P. ponderosa seedlings 
establish in groups (or patches), often in the immediate 
vicinity of older trees (Pearson 1923), and may be more 
abundant northeast of seed trees, where environmental 
conditions are less harsh (Pearson 1942; Haase 1981). 
In addition, regeneration persists at higher densities on 
limestone- than basalt-derived soils (Heidmann et al. 
1982; Goodwin 2004), is episodic in nature (Pearson 
1950; Savage & Swetnam 1990; Savage et al. 1996; 
Mast et al. 1999; Allen et al. 2002; Bailey & Covington 
2002; Brown & Wu 2005), and is limited by drought and 
competition with herbaceous vegetation (Pearson 1942; 
1950; Schubert 1974; Kolb & Robberecht 1996).
One type of disturbance in post-settlement times is 
management activities such as the intensive harvesting 
that occurred during the last century. Understanding how 
these past management activities have inﬂ uenced contem-
porary forest spatial patterns will allow managers to better 
understand the consequences of their decisions (Foster et 
al. 2003; Taylor 2004). Our objective was to use histori-
cally stem-mapped tree data to describe spatial patterns 
over a 108-year period in a pure P. ponderosa stand in 
northern Arizona. We addressed three questions: 1. How 
did an initial tree harvest in 1894 inﬂ uence the spatial 
and temporal patterns of P. ponderosa recruitment? 2. 
What are the contemporary patterns of tree recruitment 
and how do they compare to our understanding of pre-
settlement P. ponderosa stand dynamics? 3. How might 
this spatial pattern information, particularly with respect 
to patch characteristics, inform current restoration and 
management practices?
Methods
Study site
The study site is located 10 km NW of Flagstaff, 
Arizona on the Fort Valley Experimental Forest within the 
Coconino National Forest (35°15.94' N, 111°44.99' W). 
Pinus ponderosa is the only tree species on the site, and the 
understory vegetation is predominantly perennial bunch-
grasses. The site is within a vegetation unit that comprises 
7% (56 000 ha) of Coconino National Forest (Terrestrial 
Ecosystem Unit 582; Miller et al. 1995). The elevation is 
2240 m. Soils are derived from Tertiary basalt ﬂ ows and 
cinders, and are classiﬁ ed as a complex of ﬁ ne, smectitic 
Typic Argiborolls and Mollic Eutroboralfs, primarily with 
clay loam and stony clay textures (Kerns et al. 2003). Mean 
annual temperature is 7.5 °C and mean annual precipitation 
is 570 mm, following a monsoonal precipitation pattern 
with half of the precipitation as rain in July and August, 
and half as winter snow.
Our site, known as COCS1A (2.59 ha, 160 m × 160 
m), was established in 1909 as part of a network of per-
manent plots used to quantify P. ponderosa growth at the 
tree and stand levels (Pearson 1923, 1933; Moore et al. 
2004). Secondary objectives of the original study were 
to compare the effects of different harvesting and slash 
disposal practices on stand dynamics and to determine the 
effects of herbaceous competition, soil, and disturbance 
events (timber harvesting, livestock grazing, ﬁ re, and pest 
outbreaks) on P. ponderosa regeneration (Woolsey 1911, 
1912; Pearson 1923, 1933; Moore et al. 2004). COCS1A 
was selectively harvested in 1894; 8 to 10 mature (> 200 
years old) trees per ha were retained as a regeneration 
source (Pearson 1923; Nyland 1996). Beginning in 1909, 
the plot was fenced to exclude livestock.
All live trees ≥ 9.14 cm (3.6 inch) diameter at breast 
height (DBH; 1.37 m  above ground level) were measured 
and stem-mapped at plot establishment. Tree condition, 
DBH, and other variables were recorded in a ledger that 
is housed in the Fort Valley Experimental Forest Archives 
(Rocky Mountain Research Station, USDA Forest Serv-
ice, Flagstaff, AZ). The residual tree density, as measured 
in 1909, was 52 trees per ha (TPH). A thinning in 1941 
removed 16 TPH (mean DBH: 48.7 cm, SD = 21.4 cm) 
and left a residual stand density of 401 TPH. 
Data collection
Historical and contemporary ﬁ eld methods are de-
tailed by Moore et al. (2004), who also report on stand 
structure changes within a 1-ha subplot of this and other 
permanent plots throughout Arizona and New Mexico. 
For our study, we measured the entire 2.59 ha plot because 
a larger spatial extent was needed for analyses of spatial 
patterns. All live and dead tree structures, including 
stumps, snags, and wind-fallen trees that grew to at least 
breast height, were measured. Spatial coordinates of all 
tree structures were obtained with a surveying laser.
To examine recruitment patterns, all tree structures 
were designated in the ﬁ eld as either pre-harvest (center 
date ≤ 1894 at 40 cm above ground) or post-harvest 
(center date > 1894). Live trees given a pre-harvest age 
designation were cored at 40 cm above the ground, as 
were 20% of the post-harvest trees. Trees were re-cored 
up to 3 times if they missed the pith, and the best core 
was selected. Increment cores were mounted, surfaced, 
and crossdated using standard dendrochronological tech-
niques (Stokes & Smiley 1996; Swetnam & Dieterich 

- 108 years of change in spatial pattern following selective harvest of a Pinus ponderosa stand -
81
1985). When the increment core failed to intercept the 
pith, or where the pith was rotten, the number of years 
from the innermost ring to the pith was estimated with 
a pith locator (Applequist 1958). Of the 493 trees cored, 
only six could not be dated to center. The average number 
of years from the innermost ring to the pith was 4.4 years 
(SD = 3.3; n = 154). Our age estimates do not account 
for the time required for seedlings to grow to a 40 cm 
height, which can range from 3 to 10 years (Sackett 1984; 
Cormier 1990) in this area.
Stand structural scenarios
We examined the spatial patterns of three stand struc-
tural scenarios: (1) ‘unharvested’ (1909 stand structure 
as it would have been if selective harvesting had not 
occurred in 1894); (2) ‘harvested’ (actual 1909 stand 
structure); and (3) ‘contemporary’ (actual 2002 stand 
structure). We restricted our attention to trees ≥ 9.14 cm 
DBH because detailed historical data were not collected 
for smaller trees. In total, our dataset contained 219 trees 
for the unharvested scenario, 134 for the harvested sce-
nario, and 1487 for the contemporary scenario. All tree 
spatial coordinates were obtained during contemporary 
measurements. The historical stem map was used to 
verify that trees and stumps present at plot establishment 
were located correctly. 
To compare stand structure and spatial patterns 
among scenarios, we used the location (x-y coordinates), 
historical stem-map, and DBH of all trees and stumps 
(reconstructed) in each scenario. DBH data for the con-
temporary scenario were obtained during contemporary 
measurements, and data for the harvested scenario were 
obtained from the 1909 stem map and plot ledger. For the 
unharvested scenario, we also needed to account for the 
trees that were harvested in 1894. Decomposition rates 
are slow in this area (Jenny et al. 1949; Hart et al. 1992; 
Covington & Moore 1994), and most windfall and stumps 
from the 1894 harvest are still present on the site. We 
measured the current DRC of each stump, using evidence 
of past tree size such as rings of residual bark at the soil 
line, sapwood, and/or immovable rocks (designating a 
permanent root collar boundary) to aid in the measure-
ment. A regression model was used to predict DBH from 
DRC for each harvested tree (r2 = 0.96, SEresiduals = 1.18, 
n = 192; Sánchez Meador 2006).
Describing tree spatial patterns
We used univariate point pattern analyses to deter-
mine whether trees were distributed uniformly, randomly 
(also called complete spatial randomness or CSR), or 
aggregated (Upton & Fingleton 1985; Legendre 1993). 
Clark and Evans’ R (Clark & Evans 1954) is a nearest 
neighbor distance (NND) index that has been reported 
in other studies of southwestern P. ponderosa forests 
(Cooper 1961; White 1985); we used it to permit direct 
comparisons with these results. It examines the distribu-
tion associated with distance from a randomly selected 
tree to its ﬁ rst nearest neighbor. We corrected for edge 
effects and used z-tests to determine whether spatial 
distributions were signiﬁ cantly (  = 0.05) non-random. 
Ripley’s K(t) function (Ripley 1976, 1977, 1981) is 
a second-order statistic that examines the spatial pattern 
of pairs of points within t radial lag distances. It does 
not aggregate spatial data and therefore can quantify 
the intensity (density of points per unit area) of pat-
tern at multiple scales (Upton & Fingleton 1985; Dale 
1999). We used 2-m lag distances and a maximum lag 
distance of 80 m (half the minimum dimension of the 
plot; Boots & Getis 1988) to reduce the error induced by 
edge effects. Visual interpretation was simpliﬁ ed using a 
square root, variance-stabilizing transformation of K(t) to 
L(t)–t (Besag 1977). The observed values were tested for 
signiﬁ cance at  = 0.05 using 99 Monte Carlo permuta-
tions (Upton & Fingleton 1985). Clark and Evans’ R and 
Ripley’s K(t) were implemented using an online spatial 
package (Reich & Davis 1998) in S-Plus 6.1 (Insightful 
Corp., Seattle, WA, 2002).
Depending on whether patches are even- or uneven-
aged, variability in tree size within patches should be low 
or high, respectively. This hypothesis was tested for each 
scenario by using Moran’s I (Moran 1950; Legendre & Leg-
endre 1998) to examine spatial autocorrelation in DBH. As 
recommended by Legendre & Legendre (1998), each cor-
relogram was tested for global signiﬁ cance and individual 
lag distances were tested (  = 0.05, Bonferroni corrected 
to account for the number of distance classes) only when 
the global test was signiﬁ cant. The lag distance was set to 
5 m so that results were directly comparable with Biondi 
et al. (1994), which was conducted nearby and utilized 
correlogram analysis to examine spatial patterns. Spatial 
autocorrelation analysis was implemented in the R software 
environment (v.2.2.0; R development Core Team 2005) us-
ing the spdep package (Bivand & Gebhardt 2000).
Lastly, we quantiﬁ ed the number and size of patches 
for each scenario. The lag distance and value of L(t) at 
the point of maximum divergence from CSR was used 
to estimate the initial values for patch size and patch 
intensity (Reich & Davis 1998; Boyden et al. 2005). A 
Neyman-Scott point process (Neyman 1939; Neyman 
& Scott 1958) was then ﬁ t to observed point patterns 
(assuming stationarity) using least squares techniques 
(Diggle 2003; Batista & Maguire 1998; Reich & Davis 
1998) and optimized estimates of patch density and mean 
patch size were computed.

Describing tree recruitment patterns
We were speciﬁ cally interested in where and when 
seedlings established relative to unharvested trees, natural 
grass openings in the stand, and openings created by har-
vesting. We hypothesized that pine seedlings would ﬁ rst 
establish in natural grass openings and then in openings 
created by harvesting. We used Ripley’s K12(t) bivari-
ate point pattern analysis (Lotwick & Silverman 1982; 
Rowlingson & Diggle 1993; Diggle 2003) to examine 
the spatial patterns of regeneration (second popula-
tion) given the spatial pattern of established trees (ﬁ rst 
population). This statistic is computed and interpreted 
as the Ripley’s K(t) statistic, except that distances are 
calculated between points from different populations 
and conﬁ dence envelopes are formed by holding the 
locations of established trees constant while simulating 
99 toroidal shifts of the recruited tree locations. Two 
analyses were conducted, one with unharvested trees as 
the ﬁ rst population and the other with cut stumps as the 
ﬁ rst population. Analyses were implemented using R 
v.2.2.0 and the splancs package (Rowlingson & Diggle 
1993; Bivand & Gebhardt 2000).
To visualize when and where recruitment occurred, 
we examined tree age distribution over the entire plot. 
We used semivariogram analysis and kriging (Isaaks & 
Srivastava 1989) to obtain a smooth map of trees ages 
and to aid in the interpretation of tree establishment dates 
and spatial pattern. On the resulting map, individual tree 
establishment dates are interpolated across the site (on a 
5 m × 5 m grid) and smoothed contours delineate areas 
with similar establishment dates. Closer contours indicate 
greater variation in establishment dates. These analyses 
were implemented using R v. 2.2.0 and the geoR package 
(Ribeiro & Diggle 2001). 
To test if these speciﬁ c tree cohorts were an artifact of 
our center date estimation methods, we examined a subset 
of full post-harvest data set (≥ 1894; n = 277 with 44% 
estimated to be within 5 years of center) to determine if 
our age structure was dominated by a single cohort (ca. 
1919, as reported by Savage et al. 1996) and represented 
a true range of establishment dates.
Results
Tree spatial patterns
The 1894 harvest of Pinus ponderosa removed ap-
proximately one third of the trees and two-thirds of the 
stand basal area (Table 1). Most of the retained trees were 
in the southern and easterly portions of the plot, and were 
smaller in size than those removed by the harvest (Fig. 
1). By 2002, tree density had increased six-fold and basal 
area had more than doubled compared to unharvested 
conditions. 
Live trees were signiﬁ cantly aggregated under all 
scenarios (Table 1; Fig. 1), but were most strongly ag-
gregated in the harvested scenario. Trees were much 
closer together in the contemporary scenario (mean NND 
= 1.9 m) than in 1909 (mean NND = 4.5 m and 3.9 m in 
the unharvested and harvested scenarios, respectively).

In the unharvested and harvested scenarios, the data 
exhibited a distinct peak in aggregation at 6 to 8 m lag 
distances (Fig. 2a,b), indicating that patches averaged 
0.02 ha to 0.03 ha in size (Table 1). Harvesting increased 
the magnitude of this peak and also increased the scale 
at which aggregation was observed (Fig. 2b). In the 
contemporary scenario, distinct small patches were not 
discernable and trees were aggregated at all spatial scales 
tested (Fig. 2c).
Trees of similar size were positively autocorrelated 
for all three scenarios (p ≤ 0.001, 0.026, and ≤ 0.001 for 
unharvested, harvested, and contemporary, respectively). 
Signiﬁ cant autocorrelation occurred at short distances in 
1909 (lags up to 15 m in the unharvested scenario, 5 m 
in the harvested scenario) and at much greater distances 
in 2002 (lags up to 30 m) (Fig. 3). Autocorrelation sta-
tistics were much more variable in the harvested than 
unharvested scenario (Fig. 3a, b).
The 1894 harvest reduced patch density by seventy 
ﬁ ve percent with a corresponding patch size increase 
of 0.01 ha (Table 1). In the contemporary scenario, the 
observed point pattern no longer exhibits stationarity 
(visible in the NW-SE density gradient; see Fig. 1c) 
violating this assumption of the Neyman-Scott clustered 
point process. As a result, contemporary patch density 
and size could not be estimated.

aggregation and values < 0 indicate uniform (regular) spatial distribution.

Tree recruitment patterns
Pine recruitment was aggregated in the early 1900s. 
Post-harvest seedlings established ﬁ rst in the natural 
grass openings, and later around stumps and under 
pre-harvest trees. Subsequent tree recruitment was 
repulsed from unharvested trees up to 28 m (Fig. 4b) 
and attracted to cut stumps at distances beyond 8 m. 
The strength of repulsion with pre-harvest trees peaked 
at 8 m, which corresponds to the peak in aggregation 
observed with Ripley’s K(t) for the unharvested and 
harvested scenarios and the shift from random to posi-
tive association with the cut stumps present after the 
1894 harvest (Fig. 4c). 
The contemporary stand exhibits an uneven-aged 
distribution, though most trees established within 40 
years of the 1894 harvest (Fig. 5a). Tree age was spa-
tially autocorrelated at lag distances up to 22.4 m. The 
regeneration appears to consist of several cohorts. 
Following harvest, initial recruitment occurred in the 
Fig. 4.  (a) Stem map showing post-harvest trees (grey circles; trees measured in 2002 with a center date ≥ 1894 at 40 cm above 
ground level; n = 1405), unharvested trees (white squares; n = 134), and cut stumps (black circles; n = 85). The resulting Ripley’s 
K12(t) bivariate statistic (transformed as [L12(t) – t]) as a function of lag distance (t) is shown for the comparison of post-harvest 
recruitment patterns to (b) unharvested trees and (c) cut stump locations.  The horizontal dashed line is the expectation under CSR 
(random) and the dotted lines are the 95% conﬁ dence limits.  Calculated values that fall outside of the conﬁ dence interval are sta-
tistically signiﬁ cant; values > 0 indicate attraction and values < 0 indicate repulsion between the two populations.

can range from +1 (perfect positive spatial correlation) to –1 (perfect negative spatial correlation); 0 indicates no spatial correla-
tion. Black triangles indicate signiﬁ cant autocorrelation (  = 0.05, Bonferroni corrected), and white dots indicate no signiﬁ cant 
autocorrelation.

middle of the openings between patches of unhar-
vested live trees, which were previously dominated by 
grasses. Subsequent cohorts (1908-1938) established 
progressively closer to these trees (Fig. 5a,b), often 
in the growing spaces created in the 1894 harvest. 
The last of the recruitment ﬁ lled in areas not fully 
occupied by previous cohorts. No recruitment oc-
curred since 1953.
Discussion
One potential issue in our study relates to how 
representative our study site is compared to other Pinus 
ponderosa stands in northern Arizona. Bell et al. (in 
press) examined this issue extensively, and considered 
representativeness with respect to both historical and 
contemporary data. With respect to historical data, 
our unharvested tree density in 1909 (85 trees/ha; 
Table 1) is somewhat higher than historical densities 
reported for other sites (e.g. 61 trees/ha in 1876 by 
Mast et al. (1999); 62 trees/ha in 1870 by Waltz et al. 
(2003); 66 trees/ha in 1883 by Fulé et al. (1997)). Key 
differences between our study and the studies reported 
above is that our data are from historical data rather 
than reconstruction models, and that our data are from 
three decades after Euro-American settlement of the 
region while the other studies are from the time of 
Euro-American settlement. 
Our results show the same trend in tree density and 
stand basal area as other studies. A comparison of 15 
sites in Arizona and New Mexico found an average 
increase in tree density from 77 to 527 trees/ha (trees 
≥ 9.14 cm DBH) and in basal area from 8 to 28.6 m2/
ha over a 80+ year period (Moore et al. 2004). Our 
site was protected from livestock grazing since 1909, 
and this has been shown to reduce contemporary tree 
densities (Bakker & Moore 2007). At present, tree 
density on our site is roughly equal to that on other 
sites in northern Arizona (e.g., 762 trees/ha (trees ≥ 
10.2 cm DBH) on an unharvested site (Covington et 
al. 1997); 720 trees/ha (trees ≥ 2.54 cm DBH) on a 
managed site (Fulé et al. 1997). 
Tree spatial patterns
In the unharvested scenario, our site was composed 
of tree patches averaging 0.02 ha in size with sparsely 
populated zones between patches. The trees were ag-
gregated, but not as strongly as the harvested scenario. 
Our mean patch size is smaller than that reported by 
White (1985: 0.1 ha), in part due to the methods by 
which patches were designated. White (1985) also 
concluded that old P. ponderosa trees were strongly 
aggregated. In comparison, Cooper (1961) focused on 
younger stands (< 80 years) and found no evidence

that the same shading pattern is employed in the age distribution and the kriged map.  For reference, unharvested trees are shown

black circles on the map.

of aggregation; trees in most of his stands were ar-
ranged randomly. 
It appears that southwestern presettlement stands 
exhibit similar structural arrangement as stands in 
other regions. In west-central Washington, Harrod 
et al. (1999) concluded that P. ponderosa was histori-
cally aggregated at small scales (≤ 15 m), yet exhibited 
reduced aggregation and increased density during 
contemporary times. Boyden et al. (2005) reported 
a random overstory pattern for P. ponderosa in the 
Colorado Front Range, while Youngblood et al. (2004) 
observed both aggregated and random spatial patterns 
in old-growth P. ponderosa stands of eastern Oregon 
and California. 
In our study area, the selective harvest in 1894 
accentuated the already patchy nature of this for-
est. The harvest also removed many of the largest 
diameter trees, leaving smaller more uniform-sized 
trees. However, the impact on spatial patterns var-
ied with scale. At fine scales (extents ≤ 28 m), tree 
patch size was largely unaffected. At coarser scales 
(extents > 28 m), the patchiness of the residual trees 
was increased because the harvest removed the large 
trees scattered singly about the plot and also removed 
entire patches. 
The repulsion between regeneration and estab-
lished trees (Fig. 4b) suggests that recruitment fol-
lowing the harvest established in new patches rather 
than into existing pre-harvest patches. As later cohorts 
established, these patches coalesced together such that 
the contemporary stand is a single large patch. Given 
the absence of regeneration in the last 50 years, the 
stand was likely a single patch already by 1950.
Tree recruitment patterns
Our results suggest that pine establishment was 
highest in interspaces or canopy gap openings, which 
is consistent with other studies (Pearson 1923; Cooper 
1960; White 1985; Mast & Veblen 1999; Boyden et 
al. 2005). The tree recruitment patterns that we found 
are consistent with Watt’s (1947) ‘gap’ model, as 
suggested by Stephens & Fry (2005).
However, a unique finding of our study was that 
post-harvest recruitment patterns were not spatially 
random (Fig. 5a). Pinus seedlings initially established 
near the center of natural grass openings and later 
filled-in the remaining available growing space near 
the edges of the grass openings and around the stumps 
created by the 1894 harvest. Many of the trees cored 
were found to have established between 1894 and 1909 
(Fig. 5b) in spite of ongoing livestock grazing. 
While canopy gaps are important for tree recruit-
ment in shade intolerant species, regeneration was 
more successful in the natural openings than those 
created by harvesting. These natural openings were 
originally dominated by grasses and therefore were 
a focus of livestock, whose overgrazing effectively 
eliminated competition from herbaceous plants 
(Pearson 1942; Heidmann et al. 1982). When the 
site was fenced in 1909, established seedlings were 
released from trampling and/or browsing (Bakker & 
Moore 2007). Additional seedlings established after 
the site was fenced.
Our results indicate that at least two distinct 
cohorts of pine seedlings established following the 
initial harvest, with most originating in the highly 
favorable establishment year of 1919 as reported by 
Savage et al. (1996). While our results are similar, 
it should be noted that their study area was only 0.1 
ha in size and, since recruitment is not distributed 
randomly across space, they may not have captured 
the full range of cohorts.
Ecological and restoration implications
The physical legacy of presettlement tree spatial 
patterns is still present on many landscapes, though 
it may be obscured or further altered by past manage-
ment activities (i.e., harvesting, livestock grazing, 
fire exclusion) and the natural progression of stand 
dynamics. At present, land managers are treating 
thousands of hectares of southwestern P. ponderosa 
forests to reduce wildfire risk though fuel reduction 
and restoration thinnings, and the occasional com-
mercial harvest. These activities, and their resulting 
spatial pattern, affect various ecosystem components 
and processes. For example, the presence of a few 
large trees in a group has a disproportionately large 
effect on the location of the future cohorts of pine 
trees (this study), and a disproportional negative ef-
fect on understory production (Laughlin et al. 2006). 
Wildlife habitat has long been known to be sensitive 
to spatial pattern (Patton 1977; Graham et al. 1994; 
Meyer & Sisk 2001; Waltz & Covington 2003).
Our results demonstrate that spatial information 
can provide new insights into age distribution and 
other common variables. In addition, spatially-explicit 
information such as NND, patch density, and patch 
size should directly inform restoration and manage-
ment efforts. For example, prescriptions could specify 
the range of desired NNDs and the number, size, and 
shape of patches.
Currently, some prescriptions explicitly incorpo-
rate presettlement tree evidence while others simply 
set non-spatial targets (e.g., target stand density or ba-
sal area values that are applied to all acres in a stand).

tree evidence will likely reduce susceptibility to cata-
strophic fire, but may produce stand structures that 
are not ‘natural’ in these forests. For example, fuel 
reduction treatments often result in random or uniform 
spatial patterns because these patterns are more easily 
implemented (J.D. Bakkerunpubl. data).
Conclusions
Spatial analysis of structural characteristics and 
recruitment patterns permits reconstructions of stand 
development. In this stand, it provided valuable insight 
into the long-term consequences of the initial selec-
tive harvest and subsequent regeneration episodes. 
By conducting such analyses over time, we increased 
our understanding of pine establishment patterns, 
possible driving mechanisms, and the impacts of 
human disturbance (Foster et al. 2003) within the P. 
ponderosa forests of northern Arizona. 
Our findings with respect to within-patch variabil-
ity and patch size are limited by the area sampled, and 
should be investigated at larger extents (i.e., larger 
stands, watershed- or landscape-scale). In addition, 
this and many other studies that have examined 
southwestern P. ponderosa regeneration patterns were 
conducted within half a kilometer of one another on a 
single soil type (Pearson 1923; White 1985; Biondi et 
al. 1994; Savage et al. 1996; Mast et al. 1999; Kerns 
et al. 2003). Studies should be conducted on other 
soil types and parent materials to assess how broadly 
the patch size and pine seedling recruitment patterns 
found in these studies can be extrapolated. Doing 
so will better enable us to make generalizations and 
explore possible mechanisms and processes behind 
the spatial patterns.
