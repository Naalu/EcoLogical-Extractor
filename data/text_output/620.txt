08/07/2003 
Northern Arizona University's Ecological Restoration Institute received a $1 million 
grant from the U.S. Forest Service to continue its study of the ponderosa pine ecosystem.  
Researchers at the institute are studying various parts of the ecosystem, including how it 
responds to thinning and prescribed burning.  
According to a press release from NAU, the Coconino National Forest indicated that 
there is potential for some of the money to be used to identify places within the forest for 
management on a "landscape scale," including places that are home to endangered 
species, watersheds and old growth trees.
