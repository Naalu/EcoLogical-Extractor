Research and Development – 2014
Summer Field Season Data Collection
By Joe Crouse, Applications Systems Analyst, Sr.
Flagstaff Watershed Protection Project (FWPP)
Peaks Ranger District, Coconino, NF: The goal of this
project is to monitor changes in Mexican spotted owl
(MSO) habitat, or Protected Activity Centers (PACs),
primarily in mixed conifer forests on roughly 11,000
acres around Dry Lake Hills and Mormon Mountain. In
partnership with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
which will be monitoring the owls, our research will
help determine treatment effects on MSOs within the
areas of the FWPP project.

Gus Pearson Natural Area
Fort Valley Experimental Forest, USDA Forest
Service: This area is home to one of the oldest
ongoing forest restoration studies in the Southwest.
This summer, understory cover estimates and
biomass collection was completed on 55 plots.
Overstory stand conditions and surface fuels were
also remeasured prior to a planned prescribed fire.
These data help scientists and managers understand
long-term responses of different forest thinning
treatments.
 
Mixed Conifer Reference Conditions
Mogollon Ranger District, Coconino NF: This project
will characterize presettlement spatial patterns of
trees in southwestern mixed conifer forests. The
objective of this study is to provide a greater
understanding of the historical range of variability of
frequent-fire forests in the Southwest and provide
information for developing restoration prescriptions in
mixed conifer forests. Four plots, each 2.5 acres, were
inventoried for stand reconstruction analysis.
 
Mogollon
Mogollon Ranger District, Coconino NF: Little
information exists on ecological outcomes to
treatments within MSO PACs using Recovery Plan
guidelines. In this new LEARN (Long-term Ecological
Assessment and Restoration Network) project, the
ERI is establishing a rigorous, controlled and
replicated study where ecological responses to an
evidence-based restoration treatment and a MSO
PAC treatment will be monitored. Over the summer,
18 proposed treatment units were sampled.

demonstration project is intended to increase our
understanding of the response of overstory structure,
vegetation and hazardous fuels in pinyon-juniper
woodlands to treatments. The overstory was treated
in 2003 and the understory was seeded with native
plant species in 2004. Data gathered 10 years after
treatment allows us to assess long-term responses to
an evidence based restoration treatment. This field
season, crews remeasured overstory structure, fuel
loading and understory plant communities at the
demo sites.
 
Salt River Project (SRP)
Williams Ranger District, Kaibab NF: During the 2014
field season, the ERI initiated a study funded by SRP
to quantify changes in forest structure, fuels,
understory communities, and potential fire behavior
on watersheds that will be treated under 4FRI. The
primary focus of the project is to provide critically
needed information concerning water balance
responses to forest restoration treatments.
 
White Mountain Stewardship (WMS) Project
Apache-Sitgreaves, NF (ASNF): In 2004 the ASNF
awarded a stewardship contract to Future Forest, LLC
to thin 150,000 acres of degraded ponderosa pine
forests in the White Mountains of Arizona over 10
years. In 2011, ERI contracted with the ASNF and the
WMS Monitoring Board to address prioritized
ecological monitoring questions. During the 2014 field
season, crews completed monitoring of 91 plots
across 20 cutting units. These plots complement the
plots installed during the 2012 and 2013 field
seasons. Findings from analysis of 2012 and 2013
data indicated a reduction in canopy fuel loading and
potential fire behavior and untreated and lightly
treated patches were found to be small and scattered,
and also revealed no evidence that landings and

slash piles had more invasive species than other
microsites. This year was the last year of the project
and concludes monitoring of the area.
 
Agency Outreach
By Bruce Greco, Director of Agency Outreach
The Agency Outreach Team had a very successful
and productive field season this year, focused on data
collection and analysis on several key U.S. Forest
Service projects in the Southwestern Region. The
team also participated in various roles with on-going
Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Projects
and provided science support to restoration
implementation efforts. A few highlights include:
 
Upper Rocky Arroyo Restoration Project
Lakeside Ranger District, Apache-Sitgreaves NF:
Completed a rapid assessment report on a 30,860-
acre restoration project. This project is in the early
stages of a NEPA analysis with a decision anticipated
in 2015.

trail system through a mixed conifer ecosystem. The
area has active Mt. Graham red squirrel middens and
a unique management and fire history.
 
Tonto NF Forest Plan Revision
We provided an overview of ecological restoration
concepts and a historical overview of forested
ecosystems on the Tonto NF at recent public
meetings held by the USFS. We also provide best-
science information and references for consideration
in the Plan revision.
 
Prescott NF MSO Habitat Treatment Study
Bradshaw Ranger District, Prescott NF: With the
assistance of a great group of NAU-ERI student
workers, we completed a rapid assessment to
determine historical reference conditions in MSO
PACs, focusing on treatment alternatives and the role
of fire. The analysis will be summarized in an
upcoming rapid assessment report.
 
White Mountain Stewardship 10-Year Final Report
Apache-Sitgreaves NF: ERI is assisting the ASNF and
Sarah Hurteau, the project lead, in compiling the final
report for the White Mountain Stewardship Project,
which ended in August 2014.

Cutting and Fire on Understory Vegetation of Mixed
Conifer Forests. ERI Fact Sheets. Ecological
Restoration Institute, Northern Arizona University. 3 p.
 
Historically, fire occurred in dry mixed conifer forests
every 2–20 years. Other mixed conifer forests, often
on moister sites, likely burned less frequently but with
greater severity. Review of the relevant literature,
which is summarized in this fact sheet, suggests that
fuel reduction or restoration treatments can reduce
hazardous fuels and enhance native species in the
short term and total understory abundance in the long
term in dry mixed conifer forests.

Considerations for Restoring Forests of the Southwest

This fact sheet explains the need for using emerging
knowledge about climate change and tree genetics to
guide post-disturbance restoration of ponderosa pine
in the Southwest. Climate change models show an
increase in drying trends for the Southwest. As a
result, locally adapted populations of ponderosa pine
may become maladapted to current sites. Seedlings
from more arid-adapted populations may promote
forest recovery from disturbance during future
warming and drying; however, more research about
genetic variation in aridity adaptation of ponderosa
pine is needed.

With high mortality rates of aspen forests throughout
much of the West, forest ecologists investigated the
role of individual aspen tree’s lifetime growth patterns
and mortality through tree ring data to examine the
relationship between lifetime growth patterns and
mortality. Researchers found that slow growth at
various stages of the tree’s life is associated with
increased mortality risk.

Applications, 24(7), 1626–1637
 
In order to help forest managers better understand
forest recovery processes after fire under future
climate change and management actions,
researchers modeled alternative climate and
management scenarios in a severely burned forest of
Arizona. The study showed sizeable differences in
model outputs depending on climate and
management actions, indicating that managers should
incorporate climate change into analyzing
environmental effects of alternative actions.

Partner Spotlight -- Salt River Project
(SRP)
As one of the nation’s largest public power utilities,
SRP provides reliable electricity and water to more
than 2 million people in Central Arizona. Most of the
Valley’s water supply comes from winter precipitation
and runoff from Arizona mountains. In an effort to
restore health and resiliency to our forests and to
protect the state’s watersheds, NAU/ERI and SRP
researchers have partnered to study forest restoration
and how restoration treatments affect water quality.
This research will increase understanding of the
relationship between forests, fire and water.
