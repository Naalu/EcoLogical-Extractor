Preface _____________________________________
In 1978, a national workshop on fire effects in Denver, Colorado provided the impetus for the
“Effects of Wildland Fire on Ecosystems” series. Recognizing that knowledge of fire was
needed for land management planning, state-of-the-knowledge reviews were produced that
became known as the “Rainbow Series.” The series consisted of six publications, each with
a different colored cover (frequently referred to as the Rainbow series), describing the effects
of fire on soil (Wells and others 1979), water (Tiedemann and others 1979), air (Sandberg and
others 1979), flora (Lotan and others 1981), fauna (Lyon and others 1978), and fuels (Martin
and others 1979).
The Rainbow Series proved popular in providing fire effects information for professionals,
students, and others. Printed supplies eventually ran out, but knowledge of fire effects
continued to grow. To meet the continuing demand for summaries of fire effects knowledge,
the interagency National Wildfire Coordinating Group asked Forest Service research leaders
to update and revise the series. To fulfill this request, a meeting for organizing the revision was
held January 46, 1993 in Scottsdale, AZ. The series name was then changed to “The Rainbow
Series.” The five-volume series covers air, soil and water, fauna, flora and fuels, and cultural
resources.
The Rainbow Series emphasizes principles and processes rather than serving as a
summary of all that is known. However, it does provide a lot of useful information and sources
for more detailed study of fire effects. The five volumes, taken together, provide a wealth of
information and examples to advance understanding of basic concepts regarding fire effects
in the United States and Canada. While this volume focuses on the United States and Canada,
there are references to information and examples from elsewhere in the world (e.g. Australia,
South Africa, Spain, Zimbabwe, and others) to support the statements made. As conceptual
background, they provide technical support to fire and resource managers for carrying out
interdisciplinary planning, which is essential to managing wildlands in an ecosystem context.
Planners and managers will find the series helpful in many aspects of ecosystem-based
management, but they also have the responsibility to seek out and synthesize the detailed
information needed to resolve specific management questions.

The Rainbow Series was completed under the sponsorship of the Joint Fire Sciences
Program, a cooperative fire science effort of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest
Service and the U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land
Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service. We thank Marcia Patton-
Mallory and Louise Kingsbury for support and persistence to make this revision possible. We
would like to dedicate this particular volume to a former USDA Forest Service Pacific
Southwest Research Station research scientist, Steve S. Sackett, for his career-long commit-
ment to research on the effects of fire on soils, to a former Rocky Mountain Research Station
research scientist Roger D. Hungerford for his contributions to organic soil consumption and
soil heating, and to the late Benee F. Swindel, a former USDA Forest Service, Southern
Research Station scientist and Project Leader, for his counseling in the art of “perseverance”.

Summary
Fire is a natural disturbance that occurs in most terres-
trial ecosystems. It is also a tool that has been used by
humans to manage a wide range of natural ecosystems
worldwide. As such, it can produce a spectrum of effects
on soils, water, riparian biota, and wetland components
of ecosystems. Fire scientists, land managers, and fire
suppression personnel need to evaluate fire effects on
these components, and balance the overall benefits and
costs associated with the use of fire in ecosystem man-
agement. This publication has been written to provide up-
to-date information on fire effects on ecosystem re-
sources that can be used as a basis for planning and
implementing fire management activities. It is a compan-
ion publication to the recently published book, Fire’s
Effects on Ecosystems by DeBano and others (1998).
In the late 1970s, the USDA Forest Service published
a series of state-of-knowledge papers about fire effects
on vegetation, soils, water, wildlife, and other ecosystem
resources. These papers, collectively called “The Rain-
bow Series” because of their covers, were widely used by
forest fire personnel. This publication updates both the
Tiedemann and others (1979) paper on fire’s effects on
water and the Wells and others (1979) paper on soils.
This publication is divided into three major parts (A, B,
C) and an introductory chapter that provide discussions
of fire regimes, fire severity and intensity, and fire related
disturbances. Part A describes the nature of the soil
resource, its importance, characteristics and the re-
sponses of soils to fire and the relationship of these
features to ecosystem functioning and sustainability.
Part A is divided into three main chapters (2, 3, and 4) that
describe specific fire effects on the physical, chemical,
and biological properties of the soil, respectively. Like-
wise, Part B discusses the basic hydrologic processes
that are affected by fire, including the hydrologic cycle,
water quality, and aquatic biology. It also contains three
chapters which specifically discuss the effect of fire on
the hydrologic cycle, water quality, and aquatic biology in
chapters 5, 6, and 7, respectively. Part C has five chap-
ters that cover a wide range of related topics. Chapter 8
analyzes the effects of fire on the hydrology and nutrient
cycling of wetland ecosystems along with management
concerns. The use of models to describe heat transfer
throughout the ecosystem and erosional response mod-
els to fire are discussed in chapter 9. Chapter 10 deals
with important aspects of watershed rehabilitation and
implementation of the Federal Burned Area Emergency
Rehabilitation (BAER) program. Chapter 11 directs the
fire specialists and managers to important information
sources including data bases, Web sites, textbooks,
journals, and other sources of fire effects information. A
summary of the important highlights of the book are
provide in chapter 12. Last, a glossary of fire terms is
included in the appendix. The material provided in each
chapter has been prepared by individuals having specific
expertise in a particular subject.
This publication has been written as an information
source text for personnel involved in fire suppression and
management, planners, decisionmakers, land manag-
ers, public relations personnel, and technicians who
routinely and occasionally are involved in fire suppres-
sion and using fire as a tool in ecosystem management.
Because of widespread international interest in the pre-
vious and current “Rainbow Series” publications, the
International System of Units (Systeme International
d’Unites, SI), informally called the metric systems (cen-
timeters, cubic meters, grams), is used along with En-
glish units throughout the volume. In some instances one
or the other units are used exclusively where conversions
would be awkward or space does not allow presentation
of both units.

Introduction
Background ____________________
At the request of public and private wildland fire
managers, who recognize a need to assimilate current
fire effects knowledge, the Rocky Mountain Research
Station has produced a state-of-the-art integrated
series of documents relative to management of ecosys-
tems (Smith 2000, Brown and Smith 2000, Sandberg
and others 2002, Neary and others this volume, and
Jones and Ryan in preparation). The series covers our
technical understanding of fire effects, an understand-
ing that has grown considerably since the first version
of this series, the “Rainbow Series,” was published in
1979. Since that time our awareness has grown that
fire is a fundamental process of ecosystems that must
be understood and managed to meet resource and
ecosystem management goals. The volumes in the
current series are intended to be useful for land man-
agement planning, development of environmental as-
sessments and environmental impact statements,
training and education, informing others such as con-
servation groups and regulatory agencies, and access-
ing technical literature. Knowledge of fire effects has
risen in importance to land managers because fire, as
a disturbance process, is an integral part of the con-
cept of ecosystem management and restoration ecol-
ogy. Fire initiates changes in ecosystems that affect
the composition, structure, and patterns of vegetation
on the landscape. It also affects the soil and water
resources of ecosystems that are critical to overall
functions and processes.
Fire is a dynamic process, predictable but uncertain,
that varies over time and landscape space. It has
shaped plant communities for as long as vegetation
and lightning have existed on earth (Pyne 1982).
Recycling of carbon (C) and nutrients depends on
biological decomposition and fire. In regions where
decay is constrained either by dry or cold climates or
saturated (in other words, anaerobic) conditions, fire
plays a dominant role in recycling organic matter
(DeBano and others 1998). In warmer, moist climates,
decay plays the dominant role in organic matter recy-
cling (Harvey 1994), except in soils that are predomi-
nantly saturated (in other words, hydric soils).
The purpose of this volume, Effects of Fire on Soils
and Water, is to assist land managers with ecosystem
restoration and fire management planning responsi-
bilities in their efforts to inform others about the
impacts of fire on these ecosystem resources. The
geographic coverage in this volume is North America,
but the principles and effects can be applied to any
ecosystem in which fire is a major disturbance process.

of fire regimes, fire severity and intensity, and fire
related disturbances. Part A describes the nature of
the soil resource, its importance, characteristics and
the responses of soils to fire, and the relationship of
these features to ecosystem functioning and
sustainability. Part A begins with a general overview
and then is divided into three chapters (2, 3, and 4).
Likewise, part B begins with a general overview then
is divided into three chapters (5, 6, and 7) that discuss
the basic hydrologic processes that are affected by fire,
including the hydrologic cycle, water quality, and
aquatic biology. Part C has five chapters that cover a
wide range of related topics. Chapter 8 analyzes the
effects of fire on the hydrology and nutrient cycling of
wetland ecosystems along with management concerns.
The use of models to describe heat transfer throughout
the ecosystem and erosional response models to fire
are discussed in chapter 9. Chapter 10 deals with
important aspects of watershed rehabilitation and
implementation of the Federal Burned Area Emer-
gency Rehabilitation (BAER) program. Chapter 11
directs the fire specialists and mangers to important
information sources including databases, Web sites,
textbooks, journals, and other sources of fire effects
information. A summary of the important highlights
of the book are provided in chapter 12. The book
concludes with a list of references used in the volume,
and a glossary of fire terms.
Importance of Fire to Soil and Water
Soil is the unconsolidated, variable-thickness layer of
mineral and organic matter on the Earth’s surface that
forms the interface between the geosphere and the
atmosphere. It has formed as a result of physical,
chemical, and biological processes functioning simulta-
neously on geologic parent material over long periods
(Jenny 1941, Singer and Munns 1996). Soil is formed
where there is continual interaction between the soil
system and the biotic (faunal and floral), climatic (at-
mospheric and hydrologic), and topographic compo-
nents of the environment. Soil interrelates with other
ecosystem resources in several ways. It supplies air,
water, nutrients, and mechanical support for the suste-
nance of plants. Soil also receives and processes rain-
fall. By doing so, it partly determines how much be-
comes surface runoff, and how much is stored for
delivery slowly from upstream slopes to channels where
it becomes streamflow, and by how much is stored and
used for soil processes (for example, transpiration,
leaching, and so forth). When the infiltration capacity of
the soil for rainfall is exceeded, organic and inorganic
soil particles are eroded from the soil surface and
become a major source of sediment, nutrients, and
pollutants in streams that affect water quality. There is
also an active and ongoing exchange of gases between
the soil and the surrounding atmosphere. Soil also
provides a repository for many cultural artifacts, which
can remain in the soil for thousands of years without
undergoing appreciable change.
Fire can produce a wide range of changes in land-
scape appearance (fig. 1.1ABC; DeBano and others

the forest landscape of a ponderosa pine forest in
Arizona where their appearance ranged from (A) un-
burned ponderosa pine to those burned at (B) low-to-
moderate severity and those burned at (C) high severity.

1998). The fire-related changes associated with differ-
ent severities of burn produce diverse responses in the
water, soil, floral, and faunal components of the burned
ecosystems because of the interdependency between
fire severity and ecosystem response. Both immediate
and long-term responses to fire occur (fig. 1.2). Imme-
diate effects also occur as a result of the release of
chemicals in the ash created by combustion of biom-
ass. The response of biological components (soil micro-
organisms and ecosystem vegetation) to these changes
is both dramatic and rapid. Another immediate effect
of fire is the release of gases and other air pollutants
by the combustion of biomass and soil organic matter.
Air quality in large-scale airsheds can be affected
during and following fires (Hardy and others 1998,
Sandberg and others 2002). The long-term fire effects
on soils and water are usually subtle, can persist for
years following the fire, or be permanent as occurs
when cultural resources are damaged (DeBano and
others 1998, Jones and Ryan in preparation). Other
long-term fire effects arise from the relationships
between fire, soils, hydrology, nutrient cycling, and
site productivity (Neary and others 1999).
In the previous “Rainbow” series published after the
1978 National Fire Effects Workshop that reviewed
the state-of-knowledge of the effects of fire, separate
reports were published on soil (Wells and others 1979)
and water (Tiedemann and others 1979). Because of
the intricate linkage between soil and water effects,
this volume combines both.
Scope
The scope of this publication covers fire and distur-
bances in forest, woodland, and shrubland, and grass-
land ecosystems of the United States and Canada.
However, it is applicable to any area in the world
having similar forest types and fire regimes. In
some instances, research information from eco-
systems outside of North America will be used to

The fire regime concept is useful for comparing the
relative role of fire between ecosystems and for de-
scribing the degree of departure from historical condi-
tions (Hardy and others 2001, Schmidt and others
2002). The fire regime classification used in this vol-
ume is the same as that used in the volume of this
series (Brown 2000) on the effects of fire on flora.
Brown (2000) contains a discussion of the develop-
ment of fire regime classifications based on fire char-
acteristics and effects (Agee 1993), combinations of
factors including fire frequency, periodicity, intensity,
size, pattern, season, and depth of burn (Heinselman
1978), severity (Kilgore 1981), and fire periodicity,
season, frequency, and effects (Frost 1998). Hardy and
others (1998, 2001) used modal severity and frequency
to map fire regimes in the Western United States
(table 1.1).
The fire regimes described in table 1.1 are defined as
follows:
•
Understory Fire Regime: Fires are gener-
ally nonlethal to the dominant vegetation and
do not substantially change the structure of
the dominant vegetation. Approximately 80
percent or more of the aboveground dominant
vegetation survives fires. This fire regime ap-
plies to certain fire-resistant forest and wood-
land vegetation types.
•
Stand Replacement: Fires are lethal to
most of the dominant aboveground vegetation.
Approximately 80 percent or more of the
aboveground dominant vegetation is either
consumed or dies as a result of fire, substan-
tially changing the aboveground vegetative
structure. This regime applies to fire-susceptible
forests and woodlands, shrublands, and
grasslands.
•
Mixed: The severity of fires varies between
nonlethal understory and lethal stand replace-
ment fires with the variation occurring in space
or time. First, spatial variability occurs when
fire severity varies, producing a spectrum from

elucidate specific fire effects on soils and water. Fire
effects on ecosystems can be described at several
spatial and temporal scales (Reinhardt and others
2001). In this chapter we will describe fire relation-
ships suitable to each spatial and temporal scale.
The fire-related disturbances included in this re-
view include wildland fires and prescribed fires, both
in natural and management activity fuels. It also
includes disturbances from fire suppression such as
fire lines and roads, and fire retardant applications.
Fire Regimes ___________________
The general character of fire that occurs within a
particular vegetation type or ecosystem across long
successional time frames, typically centuries, is com-
monly defined as the characteristic fire regime. The
fire regime describes the typical or modal fire severity
that occurs. But it is recognized that, on occasion, fires
of greater or lesser severity also occur within a vegeta-
tion type. For example, a stand-replacing crownfire is
common in long fire-return-interval forests (fig. 1.3).

understory burning to stand replacement within
an individual fire. This results from small-scale
changes in the fire environment (fuels, terrain,
or weather) and random changes in plume
dynamics. Within a single fire, stand replace-
ment can occur with the peak intensity at the
head of the fire while a nonlethal fire occurs on
the flanks. These changes create gaps in the
canopy and small to medium sized openings.
The result is a fine pattern of young, older, and
multiple-aged vegetation patches. While this
type of fire regime has not been explicitly de-
scribed in previous classifications, it commonly
occurs in some ecosystems because of fluctua-
tions in the fire environment (DeBano and
others 1998, Ryan 2002). For example, complex
terrain favors mixed severity fires because fuel
moisture and wind vary on small spatial scales.
Secondly, temporal variation in fire severity
occurs when individual fires alternate over
time between infrequent low-intensity surface
fires and long-interval stand replacement fires,
resulting in a variable fire regime (Brown and
Smith 2000, Ryan 2002). Temporal variability
also occurs when periodic cool-moist climate
cycles are followed by warm dry periods leading
to cyclic (in other words, multiple decade-level)
changes in the role of fire in ecosystem dynam-
ics. For example in an upland forest, reduced
fire occurrence during the cool-moist cycle
leads to increased stand density and fuel
build-up. Fires that occur during the transi-
tion between cool-moist and warm-dry periods
can be expected to be more severe and have
long-lasting effects on patch and stand dynam-
ics (Kauffman and others 2003).
•
Nonfire Regime: Fire is not likely to occur.
Subsequently, Schmidt and others (2002) used these
criteria to map fire regimes and departure from his-
torical fire regimes for the contiguous United States.
This coarser-scale assessment was incorporated into
the USDA Forest Service’s Cohesive Strategy for pro-
tecting people and sustaining resources in fire adapted
ecosystems (Laverty and Williams 2000). It is explic-
itly referred to in the United States as the 2003
Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HR 1904). The clas-
sification system used by Brown (2000) found in the
Effects of Fire on Flora volume (Brown and Smith 2000)
is also based on fire modal severity, emphasizes fire
effects, but does not use frequency. Examples of vegeta-
tion types representative of each of the fire regime types
are listed in tables 1.2a,b,c. These vegetation types are
described in the Brown and Smith (2000) volume.
Fire Severity____________________
At finer spatial and temporal scales the effects of a
specific fire can be described at the stand and commu-
nity level (Wells and others 1979, Rowe 1983, Turner
and others 1994, DeBano and others 1998, Feller
1998, Ryan 2002). The commonly accepted term for
describing the ecological effects of a specific fire is fire
severity. Fire severity describes the magnitude of the
disturbance and, therefore, reflects the degree of change
in ecosystem components. Fire affects both the
aboveground and belowground components of the

United States and Canada. Some widely distributed vegetation types occur
in more than one fire regime. Variations in fire regime result from regional
differences in terrain and fire climate.

ecosystem. Thus severity integrates both the heat
pulse above ground and the heat pulse transferred
downward into the soil. It reflects the amount of
energy (heat) that is released by a fire that ultimately
affects resources and their functions. It can be used to
describe the effects of fire on the soil and water system,
ecosystem flora and fauna, the atmosphere, and soci-
ety (Simard 1991). It reflects the amount of energy
(heat) that is released by a fire that ultimately affects
resource responses. Fire severity is largely dependent
upon the nature of the fuels available for burning, and
the combustion characteristics (in other words, flam-
ing versus smoldering) that occur when these fuels are
burned. This chapter emphasizes the relationship of
fire severity to soil responses because the most is
known about this relationship, and because soil re-
sponses (see chapters 2, 3, 4, and 10) are closely related
to hydrologic responses (see chapters 5 and 6) and
ecosystem productivity (see chapters 4 and 8).
Fire Intensity versus Fire Severity
Although the literature historically contains confu-
sion between the terms fire intensity and fire severity,
a fairly consistent distinction between the two terms
has been emerging in recent years. Fire managers
trained in the United States and Canada in fire behav-
ior prediction systems use the term fire intensity in a
strict thermodynamic sense to describe the rate of
energy released (Deeming and others 1977, Stocks
and others 1989). Fire intensity is concerned mainly
with the rate of aboveground fuel consumption and,
therefore the energy release rate (Albini 1976,
Alexander 1982). The faster a given quantity of fuel
burns, the greater the intensity and the shorter the
duration (Byram 1959, McArthur and Cheney 1966,
Albini 1976, Rothermel and Deeming 1980, Alexander
1982). Because the rate at which energy can be trans-
mitted through the soil is limited by the soil’s thermal
properties, the duration of burning is critically impor-
tant to the effects on soils (Frandsen and Ryan 1986,
Campbell and others 1995). Fire intensity is not nec-
essarily related to the total amount of energy produced
during the burning process. Most energy released by
flaming combustion of aboveground fuels is not trans-
mitted downward (Packham and Pompe 1971,
Frandsen and Ryan 1985). For example, Packham and
Pompe (1971) found that only about 5 percent of the
heat released by a surface fire was transmitted into
the ground. Therefore, fire intensity is not necessarily
a good measure of the amount of energy transmitted
downward into the soil, or the associated changes that
occur in physical, chemical, and biological properties
of the soil. For example, it is possible that a high
intensity and fast moving crown fire will consume
little of the surface litter because only a small amount
of the energy released during the combustion of fuels
is transferred downward to the litter surface (Rowe
1983, VanWagner 1983, Ryan 2002). In this case the
surface litter is blackened (charred) but not consumed.
In the extreme, one author of this chapter has seen
examples in Alaska and North Carolina where fast
spreading crown fires did not even scorch all of the
surface fuels. However, if the fire also consumes sub-
stantial surface and ground fuels, the residence time
on a site is greater, and more energy is transmitted
into the soil. In such cases, a “white ash” layer is often
the only postfire material left on the soil surface (Wells
and others 1979, Ryan and Noste 1985) (fig. 1.4).
Because one can rarely measure the actual energy
release of a fire, the term fire intensity can have
limited practical application when evaluating eco-
system responses to fire. Increasingly, the term fire
severity is used to indicate the effects of fire on the
different ecosystem components (Agee 1993, DeBano
and others 1998, Ryan 2002). Fire severity has been
used describe the magnitude of negative fire impacts
on natural ecosystems in the past (Simard 1991), but
a wider usage of the term to include all fire effects is
proposed. In this context severity is a description of
the magnitude of change resulting from a fire and does
not necessarily imply negative consequences. Thus, a
low severity fire may restore and maintain a variety of
ecological attributes that are generally viewed as
positive, as for example in a fire-adapted longleaf pine
(Pinus palustris) or ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa)
ecosystem. In contrast a high severity fire may be a
dominant, albeit infrequent, disturbance in a non-fire-
adapted ecosystem, for example, spruce (Picea spp.)
whereas it is abnormal in a fire-adapted ecosystem.

While all high severity fires may have significant
negative social impacts, only in the latter case is the
long-term functioning of the ecosystem significantly
altered.
Fire Intensity Measures
Byram’s (1959) definition of fireline intensity has
become a standard quantifiable measure of intensity
(Van Wagner 1983, Agee 1993, DeBano and others
1998). It is a measure of the rate of energy release in
the flaming front of the spreading fire. It does not
address the residual flaming behind the front nor
subsequent smoldering combustion (Rothermel and
Deeming 1980, Alexander 1982). Fireline intensity
can be written as a simple equation:
I = Hwr
where
I = fireline intensity (BTU/ft/sec or kW/m/sec)
H = heat yield (BTU/lb or kW/kg of fuel)
w = mass of available fuel burned (lb/ft2 or kg/m2)
r = rate of spread (ft/sec or m/sec)
Fireline intensity is proportional to the flame length in
a spreading fire and is a useful measure of the poten-
tial to cause damage to aboveground structures (Van
Wagner 1973, Rothermel and Deeming 1980, Alexander
1982, Ryan and Noste 1985). The Canadian forest fire
danger rating system calculates the intensity of sur-
face fires and crown fires based on Byram’s equation
(Stocks and others 1989). Rothermel (1972) defined a
somewhat different measure of fire intensity, heat per
unit area, which is commonly used in fire behavior
prediction in the United States (Albini 1976, Rothermel
and Deeming 1980, Andrews 1986, Scott 1998, Scott
and Reinhardt 2001). One problem with using current
fire behavior prediction systems in ecological studies
is that they focus on flaming combustion of fine fuels
and do not predict all of the combustion and fuel
consumned, or quantify all of the energy released,
during a fire (Johnson and Miyanishi 2001). The
intensity of residual combustion of large woody fuels is
modeled in the BURNUP Model (Albini and Reinhardt
1995, Albini and others 1996) and the energy release
rate from duff consumption is modeled in the First
Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM) v.5.0 (Reinhardt
2003).
Fires burn throughout a continuum of energy re-
lease rates (table 1.3) (Artsybashev 1983, Rowe 1983,
Van Wagner 1983, Rothermel 1991). Ground fires
burn in compact fermentation and humus layers and
in organic muck and peat soils where they spread
predominantly by smoldering (glowing) combustion
and typically burn for hours to weeks (fig. 1.5). For-
ward rates of spread in ground fires range on the order
of several inches (decimeters) to yards (meters) per
day. Temperatures are commonly in excess of 572 ∞F
(300 ∞C) for several hours (Frandsen and Ryan 1986,
Ryan and Frandsen 1991, Hartford and Frandsen
1992, Agee 1993). The conditions necessary for ground
fires are organic soil horizons greater than about 1.6 to
2.4 inches (4 to 6 cm) deep and extended drying (Brown
and others 1985, Reinhardt and others 1997, Johnson
and Miyanishi 2001). Surface fires spread by flaming
combustion in loose litter, woody debris, herbaceous
plants and shrubs and trees roughly less than 6 feet

1Rates of spread, flame length, and fireline intensity vary widely in transitional fires. In subalpine and boreal fuels it is common for surface fires
to creep slowly until they encounter conifer branches near the ground, then individual trees or clumps of trees torch sending embers ahead of
the main fire. These embers start new fires, which creep until they encounter trees, which then torch. In contrast, as surface fires become more
intense, torching commonly occurs prior to onset of active crowning.
2Flame lengths are highly variable in crown fires. They commonly range from 0.5 to 2 times canopy height. Fire managers commonly report
much higher flames but these are difficult to verify or model. Such extreme fires are unlikely to result in additional fire effects within a stand but
are commonly associated with large patches of continuous severe burning.

(about 2 m) tall. Under marginal burning conditions
surface fires creep along the ground at rates of 3 feet/
hour (less than 1 m/hr) with flames less than 19 inches
(less than 0.5 m) high (table 1.3). As fuel, weather, and
terrain conditions become more favorable for burning,
surface fires become progressively more active with
spread rates ranging on the order of from tens of yards
(meters) to miles (kilometers) per day. The duration of
surface fires is on the order of 1 to a few minutes
(Vasander and Lindholm 1985, Frandsen and Ryan
1986, Hartford and Frandsen 1992) except where
extended residual burning occurs beneath logs or in
concentrations of heavy woody debris. Here flaming
combustion may last a few hours resulting in substan-
tial soil heating (Hartford and Frandsen 1992). How-
ever, the surface area occupied by long-burning woody
fuels is typically small, less than 10 percent and often
much less (Albini 1976, Ryan and Noste 1985, Albini
and Reinhardt 1995). If canopy fuels are plentiful and
sufficiently dry, surface fires begin to transition into
crown fires (Van Wagner 1977, Scott and Reinhardt
2001). Crown fires burn in the foliage, twigs, and
epiphytes of the forest or shrub canopy located above
the surface fuels. Such fires exhibit the maximum
energy release rate but are typically of short duration,
30 to 80 seconds.
Fires burn in varying combinations of ground, sur-
face, and crown fuels depending on the local conditions
at the specific time a fire passes a given point. Ground
fires burn independently from surface and crown fires
and often occur some hours after passage of the flam-
ing front (Artsybashev 1983, Rowe 1983, Van Wagner
1983, Hungerford and others 1995a, Hungerford
and others 1995b). Changes in surface and ground
fire behavior occur in response to subtle changes in
the microenvironment, stand structure, and weather
leading to a mosaic of fire treatments at multiple
scales in the ground, surface, and canopy strata (Ryan
2002).

Depth of Burn Measures
The relationship of fire intensity to fire severity
remains largely undefined because of difficulties en-
countered in relating resource responses to the burn-
ing process (Hungerford and others 1991, Hartford
and Frandsen 1992, Ryan 2002). While quantitative
relationships have been developed to describe changes
in the thermal conductivity of soil, and changes in soil
temperature and water content beneath surface and
ground fires, these relationships have not been thor-
oughly extrapolated to field conditions (Campbell and
others 1994, 1995). It is not always possible to esti-
mate the effects of fire on soil, vegetation, and air when
these effects are judged by only fire intensity measure-
ments because other factors overwhelm fire behavior.
The range of fire effects on soil resources can be
expected to vary directly with the depth of burn as
reflected in the amount of duff consumed and degree of
large woody fuel consumption (Ryan 2002). Thus, for
example, the depth of lethal heat (approximately 140 ∞F
or 60 ∞C) penetration into the soil can be expected to
increase with the increasing depth of surface duff that
is burned (fig. 1.6).
Figure 1.6—Temperature ranges associated with
various fire effects (top) (from Hungerford and oth-
ers 1991) compared to the depth of heat penetration
into mineral soil (bottom) for a crown fire over
exposed mineral soil (observed in jack pine Pinus
banksiana in the Canadian Northwest Territories) or
for ground fire burning in 5-, 15-, and 25-cm of duff
(predicted via Campbell and others1994, 1995).
Conditions are for coarse dry soil, which provides
the best conduction (i.e., a worst-case scenario).
(From Ryan 2002).

Numerous authors have used measures of the depth
of burn into the organic soil horizons or visual obser-
vation of the degree of charring and consumption of
plant materials to define fire severity for interpreting
the effects of fire on soils, plants, and early succession
(Conrad and Poulton 1966, Miller 1977, Viereck and
Dyrness 1979, Viereck and Schandelmeier 1980,
Dyrness and Norum 1983, Rowe 1983, Zasada and
others 1983, Ryan and Noste 1985, Morgan and
Neuenschwander 1988, Schimmel and Granström
1996, DeBano and others 1998, Feller 1998). Depth of
burn is directly related to the duration of burning in
woody fuels (Anderson 1969, Albini and Reinhardt
1995) and duff (Frandsen 1991a, 1991b, Johnson and
Miyanishi 2001). In heterogeneous fuels, depth of
burn can vary substantially over short distances (for
example, beneath a shrub or tree canopy versus the
inter-canopy area, or beneath a log versus not (Tunstall
and others 1976, Ryan and Frandsen 1991). At the
spatial scale of a sample plot within a given fire, depth
of burn can be classified on the basis of visual observa-
tion of the degree of fuel consumption and charring on
residual plant and soil surfaces (Ryan and Noste 1985,
Ryan 2002).
Ryan and Noste (1985) summarized literature on
the relationships between depth of burn and the char-
ring of plant materials. An adaptation of their table 2,
updated to reflect subsequent literature (Moreno and
Oechel 1989, Pérez and Moreno 1998, DeBano and
others 1998, and Feller 1998) and experience, particu-
larly in peat and muck soils, is presented in table 1.4.
This table can be used as a field guide to classifying
depth of burn on small plots (for example, quadrats).
A brief description of depth of burn characteristics is
provided for clarification of subsequent discussion of
fire effects:
•
Unburned: Plant parts are green and unal-
tered, there is no direct effect from heat. The
extent of unburned patches (mosaics) varies
considerably within and between burns as the
fire environment (fuels, weather, and terrain)
varies. Unburned patches are important
rufugia for many species and are a source of
plants and animals for recolinization of adja-
cent burned areas.
•
Scorched: Fire did not burn the area, but
radiated or convected heat from adjacent
burned areas caused visible damage. Mosses
and leaves are brown or yellow but species
characteristics are still identifiable. Soil heat-
ing is negligible. Scorched areas occur to
varying degrees along the edges of more se-
verely burned areas. As it occurs on edges,
the area within the scorched class is typically
small (Dyrness and Norum 1983) and effects
are typically similar to those in light burned
areas. The scorched class may, however, have
utility in studies of microvariation of fire
effects.
•
Light: In forests the surface litter, mosses, and
herbaceous plants are charred-to-consumed
but the underlying forest duff or organic soil is
unaltered. Fine dead twigs up to 0.25 inches
(0.6 cm) are charred or consumed, but larger
unburned branches remain. Logs may be black-
ened but are not deeply charred except where
two logs cross. Leaves of understory shrubs
and trees are charred or consumed, but fine
twigs and branches remain. In nonforest veg-
etation, plants are similarly charred or con-
sumed, herbaceous plant bases are not deeply
burned and are still identifiable, and charring
of the mineral soil is negligible. Light depth of
burn is associated with short duration fires
either because of light fuel loads (mass per
unit area), high winds, moist fuels, or a combi-
nation of these three factors. Typical forest-
floor moisture contents associated with light
depth of burn are litter (Oi) 15 to 25 percent
and duff (Oe+Oa) greater than 125 percent.
•
Moderate: In forests the surface litter, mosses,
and herbaceous plants are consumed. Shallow
duff layers are completely consumed, and char-
ring occurs in the top 0.5 inch (1.2 cm) of the
mineral soil. Where deep duff layers or organic
soils occur, they are deeply burned to com-
pletely consumed, resulting in deep char and
ash deposits but the texture and structure of
the underlying mineral soil are not visibly
altered. Trees of late-successional, shallow-
rooted species are often left on root pedestals
or topple. Fine dead twigs are completely con-
sumed, larger branches and rotten logs are
mostly consumed, and logs are deeply charred.
Burned-out stump holes and rodent middens
are common. Leaves of understory shrubs and
trees are completely consumed. Fine twigs
and branches of shrubs are mostly consumed
(this effect decreases with height above the
ground), and only the larger stems remain.
Stems of these plants frequently burn off at
the base during the ground fire phase leaving
residual aerial stems that were not consumed
in the flaming phase lying on the ground. In
nonforest vegetation, plants are similarly con-
sumed, herbaceous plant bases are deeply
burned and unidentifiable. In shrublands, av-
erage char-depth of the mineral soil is on the
order of less than 0.4 inch (1 cm), but soil
texture and structure are not noticeably al-
tered. Charring may extend 0.8 to 1.2 inches
(2.0 to 3.0 cm) beneath shrubs with deep leaf

•
Deep: In forests growing on mineral soil the
surface litter, mosses, herbaceous plants,
shrubs, and woody branches are completely
consumed. Sound logs are consumed or deeply
charred. Rotten logs and stumps are consumed.
The top layer of the mineral soil is visibly
oxidized, reddish to yellow. Surface soil tex-
ture is altered and in extreme cases fusion of
particles occurs. A black band of charred or-
ganic matter 0.4 to 0.8 inch (1 to 2 cm) thick
occurs at variable depths below the surface.
The depth of this band increases with the
duration of extreme heating. The tempera-
tures associated with oxidized mineral soil are
typical of those associated with flaming (greater
than 932 ∞F or 500 ∞C) rather than smoldering
(less than 932 ∞F or 500 ∞C). Thus, deep depth
of burn typically only occurs where woody
fuels burn for extended duration such as be-
neath individual logs or in concentrations of
woody debris and litter-filled burned out stump
holes. Representative forest-floor moisture
contents associated with deep depth of burn
are litter (Oi) less than 15 percent and duff
(Oe+Oa) less than 30 percent. In areas with
deep organic soils deep depth-of-burn occurs
when ground fires consume the root-mat or
burn beneath the root-mat. Trees often topple
in the direction from which the smoldering
fire front approached (Artsybashev 1983,
Wein 1983, Hungerford and others 1995a,b).
Depth of burn varies continuously and, as is typical
of classifications, there is some ambiguity at the class
boundaries. The moderate depth of burn class is a
broad class. Some investigators have chosen to divide
the class into two classes (Morgan and
Neuenschwander 1988, Feller 1998). The most com-
mon criteria for splitting the moderate class are be-
tween areas with shallow versus deep duff. Partial
consumption of a deep layer may be more severe than
complete consumption of a shallow layer for some
effects but not others. For example, consumption of
8 inches (20 cm) of a 12-inch (30-cm) duff layer repre-
sents greater fuel consumption, smoke production,
energy release, and nutrient release than complete
consumption of a 4-inch (10-cm) layer, but because
organic matter (duff) is a good insulator, heat effects
are limited to less than an inch (1 to 2 cm) below the
duff-burn boundary. In contrast, complete consump-
tion of the 4-inch (10-cm) layer can be expected to have
similar thermal effects at three to five times greater
depth (fig. 1.6). Duff consumption is a complex pro-
cess (Johnson and Miyanishi 2001). Depth, bulk den-
sity, heat content, mineral content, moisture con-
tent, and wind speed all affect the energy release rate
and soil heating. As these factors cannot be readily
determined after a fire, it is difficult to describe
postburn criteria that can be used to consistently
split the class. While postfire examination of ground
charring alone may not be adequate for classifying
depth of burn, the actual depth can be inferred from
the preponderance of the evidence, which includes
reconstructing the prefire vegetative structure. Care-
ful postfire observations of soil characteristics, fuel
consumption, and the depth of charring of residual
plant materials can be used to classify the depth of
burn by using the descriptive characteristics pro-
vided in table 1.4.
Fire Severity Classification
Judging fire severity solely on ground-based pro-
cesses ignores the aboveground dimension of severity
implied in the ecological definition of the severity of a
disturbance (White and Pickett 1985). This is espe-
cially important because soil heating is commonly
shallow even when surface fires are intense (Wright
and Bailey 1982, Vasander and Lindholm 1985,
Frandsen and Ryan 1986, Hartford and Frandsen
1992, Ryan 2002). Ryan and Noste (1985) combined
fire intensity classes with depth of burn (char) classes
to develop a two-dimensional matrix approach to de-
fining fire severity. Their system is based on two
components of fire severity: (1) an aboveground heat
pulse due to radiation and convection associated with
flaming combustion, and (2) a belowground heat pulse
due principally to conduction from smoldering com-
bustion where duff is present or radiation from flam-
ing combustion where duff is absent—in other words,
bare mineral soil. Fire-intensity classes qualify the
relative peak energy release rate for a fire, whereas
depth of burn classes qualify the relative duration of
burning. Their concept of severity focuses on the eco-
logical work performed by fire both above ground and
below ground. Ryan (2002) combined surface fire char-
acteristic classes (table 1.3) and depth of burn classes
(table 1.4) to revise the Ryan and Noste (1985) fire
severity matrix (table 1.5). By this nomenclature two
burned areas would be contrasted as having had, for
example, an active spreading-light depth of burn fire
versus an intense-moderate depth of burn fire. The
matrix provides an approach to classifying the level of
fire treatment or severity for ecological studies at the
scale of the individual plant, sampling quadrat, and
the community. The Ryan and Noste (1985) approach
has been used to interpret differences in plant survival
and regeneration (Willard and others 1995, Smith and

Fischer 1997, Feller 1998) and to field-validate satel-
lite-based maps of burned areas (White and others
1996). The depth of burn characteristics are appropri-
ate for quadrat-level descriptions in species response
studies and for describing fire severity on small plots
within a burned area.
In the literature there is common usage of a one-
dimension rating of fire severity (Wells and others 1979,
Morrison and Swanson 1990, Agee 1993, DeBano and
others 1998, and many others). The single-adjective
rating describes the overall severity of the fire and
usually focuses primarily on the effects on the soil
resource. The fire severity rating in table 1.5 provides
guidance for making comparisons to the two-dimen-
sional severity rating of Ryan and Noste (1985) and Ryan
(2002), and for standardizing the use of the term. At the
spatial scale of the stand or community, fire severity
needs to be based on a sample of the distribution of fire
severity classes. In the original Rainbow volume on the
effects of fire on soils, Wells and others 1979 (see also

USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
15
Ryan and Noste 1985, DeBano and others 1998) devel-
oped the following criteria to do this:
•
Low severity burn—less than 2 percent of the
area is severely burned, less than 15 percent
moderately burned, and the remainder of the
area burned at a low severity or unburned.
•
Moderate severity burn—less than 10 percent
of the area is severely burned, but more than
15 percent is burned moderately, and the re-
mainder is burned at low severity or unburned.
•
High severity burn—more than 10 percent of
the area has spots that are burned at high
severity, more than 80 percent moderately or
severely burned, and the remainder is burned
at a low severity.
The Wells and others (1979) criteria for defining the
burn severity class boundaries are somewhat arbi-
trary but were selected on the basis of experience
recognizing that even the most severe of fires has
spatial variation due to random variation in the fire
environment (fuels, weather, and terrain), and par-
ticularly localized fuel conditions. Recently, Key and
Benson (2004) have developed a series of procedures
for documenting fire severity in the context of field
validation of satellite images of fire severity. Their
procedures result in a continuous score, called the
Composite Burn Index (CBI), which is based on visual
observation of fuel consumption and depth of burn in
several classes of fuels and vegetation.
In most situations, depth of burn is the primary
factor of concern when assessing the impacts of fire on
soil and water resources (fig. 1.7). Depth of burn
relates directly to the amount of bare mineral soil
exposed to rain-splash, the depth of lethal heat pen-
etration, the depth at which a hydrophobic layer will
form, the depth at which other chemical alterations
occur, and the depth to which microbial populations
will be affected. As such it affects many aspects of
erodability and hydrologic recovery (Wright and Bailey
1982, DeBano and others 1998, Gresswell 1999,
Pannkuk and others 2000). However, depth of burn is
not the only controlling factor (Ryan 2002). For ex-
ample, the surface microenvironment, shaded versus
exposed, in surface fires versus crown fires can be
expected to affect postfire species dynamics regard-
less of the depth of burn (Rowe 1983). In a surface
fire, needles are killed by heat rising above the fire
(Van Wagner 1973, Dickinson and Johnson 2001),
thereby retaining their nutrients. Thus, litterfall of
scorched needles versus no litterfall in crown fire
areas can be expected to affect postfire nutrient cy-
cling. Further, rainfall simulator experiments have
shown that needle cast from underburned trees re-
duced erosion on sites where duff was completely
consumed in contrast to crown fire areas with similar

erate to deep burn depths; and (B) light to moderate
depths. (Photos by USDA Forest Service).
depth of burn (Pannkuk and others 2000). Thus, a
lethal stand replacement crown fire (in other words, a
fire that kills the dominant overstory; Brown 2000)
represents a more severe fire treatment than a lethal
stand replacement surface fire even when both have
similar depth of burn (fig. 1.8). Thus for many ecologi-
cal interpretations it is desirable to use the two-
dimensional approach to rating fire severity to ac-
count for the effects of both the aboveground and
belowground heat pulses.
A Conceptual Model
The previous discussion leads to development of a
conceptual model to help planners, managers, and
decisionmakers appreciate the spectrum of watershed
responses to fire severity. The conceptual model de-
scribes fire severity as ranging from low water resource

responses likely to be experienced with a prescribed
fire and no accompanying hydrologic events to high
resource responses that could be expected from stand-
replacing wildfire in forests and major storm events
(fig. 1.9). Once again, fire severity is not directly
related to fire intensity for the reasons discussed
above.
Figure 1.8—Site and weather factors associated with increasing
fire severity and erosion potential.
Prescribed fire conditions (generally low fire sever-
ity) are depicted in figure 1.9 on the lower portion of
the fire severity and resource response curve. These
conditions are typically characterized by lower air
temperature, higher relative humidity, and higher
soil moisture burning conditions, where fuel loading is
low and fuel moisture can be high. These conditions
produce lower fire intensities and, as a consequence,
lower fire severity leading to reduced potential for
subsequent damage to soil and water resources. Pre-
scribed fire, by its design, usually has minor impacts
on these resources.
Fire at the other end of the severity spectrum (left
side of fig. 1.9) more nearly represents conditions that
are present during a wildfire, where temperatures,
wind speeds, and fuel loadings are high, and humidity
and fuel moisture are low. In contrast to prescribed
burning, wildfire often has a major effect on soil and
watershed processes, leading to increased sensitivity
of the burned site to vegetative loss, increased runoff,
erosion, reduced land stability, and adverse aquatic
ecosystem impacts (Agee 1993, Pyne and others 1996,
DeBano and others 1998).
Differences in watershed response along the spec-
trum between prescribed burning and wildfire or within
an individual fire depend largely upon fire severity
and the magnitude of hydrologic events following fire.
Although significant soil physical, chemical, and bio-
logical impacts would occur with a stand-replacing
wildfire, there would be no immediate watershed
response in the absence of a hydrologic event. As
indicated in figure 1.9, the magnitude of watershed

response is keyed to the size (return period) of the
hydrologic event or storm and the timing relative to
fire. In addition to climate interactions with fire sever-
ity, topography also has a major influence on water-
shed response. Forested watersheds in mountainous
regions of the West or East respond to storm events
very differently than those in the Coastal Plain or
Great Lakes where relief is at a minimum.
Fire-Related Disturbances ________
Fire
As discussed above, the primary disturbance to soil
and water resources is a function of fire severity.
Removal of vegetation alone is sufficient to produce
significant soil and watershed responses (Anderson
and others 1976, Swank and Crossley 1988, Neary and
Hornbeck 1994). In areal extent and severity level, the
disturbance produced by fire can be small or large, and
uniform or a chaotic matrix. Beyond the initial vegeta-
tion and watershed condition impacts of the physical
process of fire, suppression activities can add further
levels of disturbance to both soils and water. These
disturbances need to be evaluated along with those
produced by fire.
Fire Suppression
Fire managers need to be aware of the soil and water
impacts of suppression activities. The major soil and
water disturbances associated with fire suppression
are fire lines, roads, and fire retardants. Fire control
lines created by hand or large equipment disturb the
soil, alter infiltration, become sources of sediment,
and can alter runoff patterns (see chapter 2). Suppres-
sion activities in boreal forests have been known to
lead to decreasing permafrost depth resulting in
downcutting and slope failures (Viereck 1982). Roads
are already major sources of sediment in forest water-
sheds (Brown and Binkley 1994; Megahan 1984, Swift
1984). Temporary roads built during suppression op-
erations increase the size of road networks and erosion
hazard areas within watersheds. In addition, traffic
from heavy equipment and trucks can deteriorate the
surfaces of existing roads, making them more prone to
erosion during rainfall. Although fire retardants are
basically fertilizers, they can produce serious short-
term water quality problems if dropped into perennial
streams.
Type of Effects
The effects of fire on soil and water resources can be
direct and indirect. They occur at many scales (microsite
to ecosystem level), in different patterns, and over
variable periods. In most watersheds of fire dependent
or dominated ecosystems, fire impacts to soils and
water are significant components and variable back-
grounds of cumulative watershed effects. An under-
standing of these effects is important for land manag-
ers who deal with wildfire and use prescribed fire to
accomplish ecosystem management objectives.
This Book’s Objective ____________
The objective of this volume in the Rainbow series is
to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art under-
standing of the effects of fire on soils and water in
wildland ecosystems. It is meant to be an information
guide to assist land managers with fire management
planning and public education, and a reference on fire
effects processes, pertinent publications, and other
information sources. Although it contains far more

is left to several textbooks (Chandler and others 1991,

providing a meaningful summary for North American
fire effects on soils and water resources despite enor-
mous variations produced by climate, topography, fuel
loadings, and fire regimes.

Introduction ____________________
Soil is a heterogeneous mixture of mineral particles
and organic matter that is found in the uppermost
layer of Earth’s crust. The soil is formed as a product
of the continual interactions among the biotic (faunal
and floral), climatic (atmospheric and hydrologic),
topographic, and geologic features of the environment
over long periods (Jenny 1941, Singer and Munns
1996). Soils are important components of ecosystem
sustainability because they supply air and water,
nutrients, and mechanical support for the sustenance
of plants. Soils also absorb water during infiltration.
By doing so, they provide storage for water as well as
acting as a conduit that delivers water slowly from
upstream slopes to channels where it contributes to
streamflow. There is also an active and ongoing ex-
change of gases between the soil and the surrounding
atmosphere. When the infiltration capacity of the soil
is exceeded, organic and inorganic soil materials are
eroded and become major sources of sediment, nutri-
ents, and pollutants in streams. These water and

erosional processes are described in part B and chap-
ters 5, 6, and 7 of this publication.
To fully evaluate the effects of fire on a soil, it is first
necessary to quantitatively describe the soil and then
to discuss the movement of heat through the soil
during a fire (wildfires or prescribed burns). During
the process of soil heating, significant changes can
occur in the physical, chemical, and biological proper-
ties that are relevant to the future productivity and
sustainability of sites supporting wildland ecosys-
tems. This introductory part A presents a general
discussion on the properties of soils and the heating
processes occurring in soils during fires, and provides
some general information on the physical, chemical,
and biological responses to fire. This part is also
intended as an extended executive summary for those
interested in the general concepts concerning fire
effects on soils. Readers who are interested in more
detailed information on fire effects on soils are di-
rected to indepth discussions of the individual physi-
cal, chemical, and biological properties and processes
in soil that are affected by fire (see chapters 2, 3, and
4, respectively).

The General Nature of Soil ________
The features and the importance of soils are usually
inconspicuous to the average person. Soil is simply the
substrate that is walked on, that is used to grow trees
or a garden, that creates a source of dust when the
wind blows, that provides material that washes down
the hillslope during runoff, or that is bared when the
firefighter builds a fireline. However, closer examina-
tion shows that soil is a complex matrix made up of
variable amounts of mineral particles, organic matter,
air, and water. The inorganic constituents of soils
contain a wide array of primary (for example, quartz)
and secondary (for example, clays) minerals.
Organic matter is the organic portion of the soil and
is made up of living and dead biomass that contains a
wide range of plant nutrients. The living biomass in
the soil consists of plant roots, microorganisms, inver-
tebrates, and small and large vertebrate fauna that
burrow in the soil. The nonliving organic matter is
made up primarily of dead bark, large woody debris
(dead trees, limbs, and so forth), litter, duff, and finely
decomposed humus materials. Organic matter is bro-
ken down and decomposed by the actions of animals
and microorganisms living in the soil. An important
component of organic matter is humus, the colloidal
soil organic matter (particles smaller than 3.9 to 20 x
10-6 inches [0.001 to 0.005 mm] in diameter) that
decomposes slowly. Humus provides negative adsorp-
tion sites similar to clay minerals and also acts as an
organic glue that helps to hold mineral soil particles
together to form aggregates. This contributes to soil
structure that creates pore space soil and provides
passageways for the movement of air and water. The
decomposition of organic matter also plays a central
role in the cycling and availability of nutrients essen-
tial for plant growth. Organic matter also provides a
source of energy necessary to support microbial popu-
lations in the soil.
Water and air occupy the empty spaces (pore space)
created by the mineral-organic matter matrix in the
soil. A delicate balance exists between the amount of
pore space filled with water and that filled with air,
which is essential for root respiration by living plants.
Too much soil water can limit plant growth if the pore
space is saturated with water (for example, water-
logged, anaerobic soils). In contrast, when too little
water is available, plant growth can be limited by the
lack of water necessary for transpiration and other
physiological functions necessary for the growth of
plants. Soil water also contains dissolved ions (cations
and anions), and this is called the “soil solution.” Many
of the ions in the soil solution are absorbed by plant
roots and used for plant growth.
A combination of the inorganic materials described
above, along with variable amounts of finely divided
and partially decomposed organic matter (humus),
provides structure to the soil. Soil structure is the
arrangement of the inorganic components of the soil
into aggregates having distinctive patterns (for ex-
ample, columnar, prismatic, blocky). These aggre-
gates are stabilized by organic matter that provides an
overall porous structure to the soil.
Soil Properties—Characteristics,
Reactions, and Processes ________
The reader needs to be aware of some general defi-
nitions and terminology that are used in reference to
soil properties when reading chapters 2, 3, and 4. The
term “soil properties” is collectively used to include the
characteristics, reactions, and processes that occur in
soils. Traditionally, soils have been described in terms
of physical, chemical, and biological properties. This
classification is arbitrary, and in many cases the three
classes of soil properties are not mutually exclusive
but are so closely interconnected that it is impossible
to clearly place a soil property in any one of the three
categories. This interrelationship is particularly ap-
parent in the discussions on organic matter and the
different processes responsible for nutrient cycling.
Because of this interdependency, we attempted to
discuss the physical, chemical, and biological dimen-
sions of nutrient cycling and organic matter sepa-
rately, and then to cross-reference these discussions
among the three general categories.
Soil Profile _____________________
Variable amounts and combinations of minerals,
organic matter, air, and water produce a wide range
of physical, chemical, and biological properties of a
soil. However, these properties are not randomly
distributed but occur in an orderly arrangement of
horizontal layers called soil horizons. The arrange-
ment of these layers extending from the surface litter
downward to bedrock is referred to as the soil profile.
A schematic profile is shown in figure A.1, and a real
profile in figure A.2. Some profiles have distinct
horizons as shown in figure A.2, but some soils have
horizons that are not so distinct. The uppermost
layers consist mainly of organic matter in various
stages of decomposition. The surface litter layer (L-
layer) is made up of undecomposed organic material
that retains the features of the original plant mate-
rial (leaves, stems, twigs, bark, and so forth). Imme-
diately below the undecomposed layer is another
organic layer that is in various stages of decomposi-
tion. It is called the fermentation layer (F-layer). In
the F-layer, some of the original plant structure may
still be discernable depending on the extent of de-
composition. The lowermost surface organic matter
layer is the humus layer (H-layer) that is completely

USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
23
decomposed organic matter. The H-layer is an impor-
tant site for nutrient availability and storage. The
finely decomposed organic matter in the H-layer is
also the source of aggregating substances that com-
bine with the mineral soil particles in the upper
inorganic horizons to produce soil structure. The
original plant structure is no longer identifiable in
the H-layer. The combined F-and H-layer is com-
monly referred to as the duff.
More recent designations have been developed for
the L-, F-, and H-layers described above. Current
taxonomic terminology refers to the organic horizon as
the O horizon. The L-layer is referred to as the Oi or O1
horizon. The F-layer is designated as the Oe, or part of
the O2 horizon and the H-layer is denser than the L-
and F-layers and is designated as the Oa or O2 horizon.
The mineral soil horizons begin with the uppermost
part of the A-horizon and extend downward to bed-
rock. Depending upon the age and development of the
soil profile, there can be several intermediate mineral
horizons (for example, E-, B-, and C-horizon). The A-
horizon is the top mineral layer, and the upper part of
this horizon often contains large quantities of finely
decomposed organic matter (humus). The mineral E-
horizon is located immediately below the A-horizon. It
is the site where substantial amounts of silicate, clay,
iron, aluminum, carbonate, gypsum, or silicon are lost
by weathering and leaching that occurs during soil
development. Materials leached downward from the
E-horizon accumulate mainly in the B-horizon. In
well-developed (mature) soil profiles, the original rock
structure can no longer be recognized in the B-horizon.
The C-horizon is unconsolidated parent rock material
remaining above the R-horizon that is made up of hard
consolidated bedrock.
Importance of Organic Matter _____
The effects of fire on soils cannot be fully evaluated
unless the role of organic matter in the functioning
and sustainability of soil ecosystems is understood.
Organic matter is the most important soil constituent
that is found in soils. Although it is concentrated on
the soil surface where it makes up most of the L-, F-,
and H-layers, it also plays an important role in the

ture) soil profile showing a complete suite of the organic
and inorganic soil horizons. (Figure courtesy of the

Resource Institute, Tucson, AZ).

properties of the underlying mineral soil horizons.
Ecologically, organic matter plays three major roles:
•
Organic matter enhances the structure of soils.
The most important physical function of or-
ganic matter is its role in creating and stabiliz-
ing soil aggregates. A porous well-structured
soil is essential for the movement of water, air,
and nutrients through soils and as a result
organic matter contributes directly to the
productivity and sustainability of wildland
ecosystems.
•
Chemically, organic matter maintains and
regulates the biogeochemical cycling of nutri-
ents by providing an active medium for sus-
taining numerous chemical and biological
transformations. As such, it plays a key role in
the productivity of plant ecosystems. Its spe-
cific roles in nutrient cycling include: provid-
ing a storage reservoir for all plant nutrients,
maintaining a balanced supply of available
nutrients, creating a large cation exchange
capacity for storing available nutrients in soils,
and functioning as a chelating agent for essen-
tial plant micronutrients (for example, iron).
•
Soil provides a habitat for plant and animal
organisms that range in size from bacteria and
viruses to small mammals. The microbiologi-
cal populations in the soil are usually incon-
spicuous to most observers although the soil
can be teeming with hundreds of millions of
microorganisms in each handful of forest soil.
Their activity and diversity far exceeds that of
the other biological components of forest eco-
systems (for example, vegetation, insects, wild-
life, and so forth). Soil organic matter is of
particular importance to soil microorganisms
because it provides the main source of energy
for sustaining soil microorganisms. Soil mi-
croorganisms are involved in nearly all of the
processes responsible for the cycling and avail-
ability of nutrients such as decomposition,
mineralization, and nitrogen (N) fixation.
Fire Effects—General Concepts and
Relationships___________________
The effects of fire on soil properties must be evalu-
ated within the concept of a complex organic and
inorganic matrix of the soil profile described above.
The magnitude of change occurring during a fire
depends largely upon the level of fire severity, combus-
tion and heat transfer, magnitude and depth of soil
heating, proximity of the soil property to the soil
surface, and the threshold temperatures at which the
different soil properties change.
Severity and Fire Intensity
When discussing the effects of fire on the soil resource
it is important to differentiate between fire intensity
and fire severity because frequently they are not the
same (Hartford and Frandsen 1992). Fire intensity is a
term that is used to describe the rate at which a fire
produces thermal energy (Brown and Davis 1973, Chan-
dler and others 1991). Fire intensity is most frequently
quantified in terms of fireline intensity because this
measure is related to flame length, which is easily
measured (DeBano and others 1998). Fire severity, on
the other hand, is a more qualitative term that is used
to describe ecosystem responses to fire and is particu-
larly useful for describing the effects of fire on the soil
and water system (Simard 1991). Severity reflects the
amount of energy (heat) that is released by a fire and the
degree that it affects the soil and water resources. It is
classified according to postfire criteria on the site burned
and has been classified into low, moderate, and high fire
severity. Detailed descriptions of the appearances of
these three severity levels for timber, shrublands, and
grasslands are presented in table 1.4, Parts A,B,C
respectively. (Note: this table and the parts can be
found on pages 11 and 12 in Chapter 1).
The level of fire severity depends upon:
•
Length of time fuel accumulates between fires
and the amount of these accumulated fuels
that are combusted during a fire (Wells and
others 1979).
•
Properties of the fuels (size, flammability,
moisture content, mineral content, and so forth)
that are available for burning
•
The effect of fuels on fire behavior during the
ignition and combustion of these fuels.
•
Heat transfer in the soil during the combustion
of aboveground fuels and surface organic layers.
High intensity fires can produce high severity changes
in the soil, but this is not always the case. For example,
low intensity smoldering fires in roots or duff can cause
extensive soil heating and produce large changes in the
nearby mineral soil. In contrast, high severity crown
fires may not cause substantial heating at the soil
surface because they sweep so rapidly over a landscape
that not much of the heat generated during combustion
is transferred downward to the soil surface.
Combustion
Energy generated as heat during the combustion of
aboveground and surface fuels provides the driving
force that causes a wide range of changes in soil
properties during a fire (DeBano and others 1998).
Combustion is the rapid physical-chemical destruc-
tion of organic matter that releases the large amounts
of energy stored in fuels as heat. These fuels consist of

USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
25
dead and live standing biomass, fallen logs, surface
litter (including bark, leaves, stems, and twigs), hu-
mus, and sometimes roots. During the combustion
process heat and a mixture of gaseous and particulate
byproducts are released. Flames are the most visual
characteristic of the combustion process.
Three components are necessary in order for a fire to
ignite and initiate the combustion process (Country-
man 1975). First, burnable fuel must be available.
Second, sufficient heat must be applied to the fuel to
raise its temperature to the ignition point. And last,
sufficient oxygen (O2) is needed to be present to keep
the combustion process going and to maintain the heat
supply necessary for ignition of unburned fuel. These
three components are familiar to fire managers as the
fire triangle.
A common sequence of physical processes occurs in
all these fuels before the energy contained in them is
released and transferred upward, laterally, or down-
ward where it heats the underlying soil and other
ecosystem components. There are five physical phases
during the course of a fire, namely: preignition, igni-
tion, flaming, smoldering, and glowing (DeBano and
others 1998). These different phases have been de-
scribed in more detail by several authors (Ryan and
McMahon 1976, Sandberg and others 1979, Pyne and
others 1996). Preignition is the first phase when the
fuel is heated sufficiently to cause dehydration and
start the initial thermal decomposition of the fuels
(pyrolysis). After ignition, the three phases of combus-
tion that occur are flaming, smoldering, and glowing
combustion. When active flaming begins to diminish,
smoldering increases, and combustion diminishes to
the glowing phase, which finally leads to extinction of
the fire.
Heat Transfer
Heat produced during the combustion of
aboveground fuels (for example, dead and live veg-
etation, litter, duff) is transferred to the soil surface
and downward through the soil by several heat trans-
fer processes (radiation, convection, conduction, va-
porization, and condensation). Radiation is the trans-
fer of heat from one body to another, not in contact
with it, by electromagnetic wave motion; it increases
the molecular activity of the absorbing substance and
causes the temperature to rise (Countryman 1976b).
Conduction is the transfer of heat by molecular activ-
ity from one part of a substance to another, or be-
tween substances in contact, without appreciable
movement or displacement of the substance as a
whole (Countryman 1976a). Convection is a process
whereby heat is transferred from one point to another
by the mixing of one portion of a fluid with another
fluid (Chandler and others 1991). Vaporization and
condensation are important in fire behavior and
serve as a coupled reaction facilitating more rapid
transfer of heat through soils. Vaporization of water
occurs when it is heated to a temperature at which it
changes from a liquid to a gas. Condensation occurs
when water changes from a gas to a liquid with the
simultaneous release of heat. The coupled reaction of
vaporization and condensation provides a mecha-
nism for the transfer of both water and organic
materials through the soil during fires (DeBano and
others 1998).
The mechanisms for the transfer of heat through
different ecosystems components vary widely (table
A.1). Although heat is transferred in all directions,
large amounts of the heat generated during a fire are
lost into the atmosphere (along with smoke, gases, and
particulate matter generated by fire) by radiation,
convection, and mass transfer (DeBano and others
1998). It has been estimated that only about 10 to 15
percent of the heat energy released during combustion
of aboveground fuels is absorbed and transmitted
directly downward to the litter and duff, or mineral
soil if surface organic layers are absent. This occurs
mainly by radiation (DeBano 1974, Raison and others
1986). Within the fuels themselves most of the heat
transfer is by radiation, convection, and mass trans-
fer. Meanwhile in the soil, convection and vaporiza-
tion and condensation are the most important mecha-
nisms for heat transfer in a dry soil. In a wet or moist
soil, conduction can contribute significantly to heat
transfer. The heat transfer processes occurring in the
soil are described in more detail in chapter 2 of this
publication. The transfer of heat through mineral soil
is important because it causes soil heating and pro-
duces changes in the soil physical, chemical, and
biological properties described in chapters 2, 3, and 4,
respectively.
Depth and Magnitude of Soil Heating
As heat is transferred downward into and through
the soil, it raises the temperature of the soil. The
greatest increase in temperature occurs at, or near,
the soil surface. Within short distances downward in
the soil, however, the temperature increases quickly
diminish so that within 2.0 to 3.9 inches (5 to 10 cm) of
the soil surface the temperatures are scarcely above
ambient temperature. A diagram of the heat increases
with depth is called a temperature profile and is useful
for determining the amount of change that occurs in a
soil during a fire as the result of heating. The magni-
tude of these temperature increases depends on the
severity of the fire as described above. Residence time
of the fire (the duration of heating) is a particularly
important feature of fires, affecting the depth and
magnitude of soil heating. Detailed information on
temperature profiles that can develop during grassland,
shrubland, and forest fires is presented in chapter 2.

26
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
Temperature Thresholds of Soil
Properties
An important feature when assessing the effect of
fire on soil properties is the temperature at which
nutrients are volatilized or that irreversible damage
occurs to a particular soil property. This temperature
is called the threshold temperature (DeBano and oth-
ers 1998). Temperature thresholds have been identi-
fied for numerous physical, chemical, and biological
properties. The ranges of temperatures over which
some common soil properties change in response to
soil heating are displayed in figure 1.6. These tem-
perature thresholds have been classified into three
general classes, namely:
•
Relatively insensitive soil properties that do
not change until temperatures have reached
over about 842 ∞F (450 ∞C). This class includes
clays, cations (calcium, magnesium, potas-
sium) and other minerals such as manganese.
•
Moderately sensitive soil properties that are
changed at temperatures between 212 and
752 ∞F (100 and 400 ∞C). Materials belonging
to this class include sulfur, organic matter, and
soil properties dependent upon organic matter.
•
Sensitive soil properties are those that are
changed at temperatures less than 212 ∞F
(100 ∞C). Examples of sensitive materials are
living microorganisms (for example, bacteria,
fungi, mychorrizae), plant roots, and seeds.
This class also includes many of the biologi-
cally mediated nutrient cycling processes in
soils.
Threshold values for specific physical, chemical, and
biological soil properties are described in greater de-
tail in chapters 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
Location of Soil Properties
The natural differentiation of the soil profile into
horizons creates a stratification of the physical, chemi-
cal, and biological soil properties discussed above.
Understanding this stratified arrangement is neces-
sary in order to accurately assess the effects of fire and
soil heating on the different soil properties. The soil
properties near or on the soil surface are the most
directly exposed to heat that is radiated downward
during a fire. Soil heating generally decreases rapidly
with soil depth in a dry soil because dry soil is a poor
conductor of heat.
The organic horizons that make up the forest floor
are particularly important when discussing fire ef-
fects, because they are directly subjected to heat
produced by burning of surface fuel, and they contain
a large proportion of the organic matter found in soil
profiles (DeBano and others 1998). Although some of
the individual nutrients contained in the organic
matter may not be volatilized, others such as N are
vaporized in direct proportion to the amount of or-
ganic material lost. Most of the fire effects produced
during surface fires occur in the upper organic hori-
zons, or in the top part of the A-horizon. Heating of
the B-horizon and deeper in the soil profile occurs
only when roots are ignited and create localized
subsurface heating.

Assessing Fire Effects on
Soils __________________________
The above general information on soils along with
the detailed information given in chapters 2, 3, and 4
on physical, chemical, and biological soil properties,
respectively, can be used to assess fire effects on soils.
This assessment requires being able to quantify the
effect of fire and associated soil heating on soil proper-
ties and includes three main steps:
•
First, the amount of energy radiated down-
ward during combustion of fuels must be esti-
mated. This energy is the driving force respon-
sible for producing changes in soil properties.
In general, the magnitude of change in indi-
vidual soil properties is largely dependent
upon the amount of energy radiated onto the
soil surface, and subsequently transferred
downward into the underlying duff and min-
eral soil. This radiated heat increases the
temperature and causes changes in organic
matter and other soil properties. Therefore,
the postfire appearance of vegetation, litter,
duff, and upper soil horizons can be used to
estimate the amounts of surface heating and
used to classify fire severity as low, moderate,
or high. The basic assumption used in this
technique is that as the amount of heat radi-
ated downward increases, the severity in-
creases from low to moderate to high (in other
words, the magnitude of change in the soil
property increases). An earlier discussion de-
scribing fire severity provides the necessary
framework for establishing the severity of the
fire in different ecosystems.
•
After the fire severity has been established it
can be used to estimate soil temperatures that
develop when different ecosystems are burned
(for example, grassland, shrubland, forests).
Representative soil temperatures for different
severities of burning for different ecosystems
are discussed in chapter 2.
•
Finally, once the approximate soil tempera-
tures have been established, the changes in
specific soil properties can be estimated using
temperature threshold information. The per-
centage loss of different nutrients can be used
along with estimates of the quantities of nutri-
ents affected by fire to estimate the total nutri-
ent losses, or gains, which occurred on a specific
site during a fire. Specific information on the
temperatures at which different physical,
chemical, and biological soil properties changes
are give in chapters 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
Management Implications ________
The condition of the soil is a key factor in the
productivity of forest ecosystems and the hydrologic
functioning of watersheds. Cumulative impacts that
occur in soils as a result of fire can manifest them-
selves in significant changes in soil physical, chemical,
or biological properties. These include breakdown in
soil structure, reduced moisture retention and capac-
ity, development of water repellency, changes in nutri-
ent pools cycling rates, atmospheric losses of ele-
ments, offsite erosion losses, combustion of the forest
floor, reduction or loss of soil organic matter, alter-
ations or loss of microbial species and population
dynamics, reduction or loss of invertebrates, and par-
tial elimination (through decomposition) of plant roots.
Although the most serious and widespread impacts on
soils occur with stand-replacing wildfires, prescribed
fires sometimes produce localized problems. Manag-
ers need to be aware of the impacts that fire can have
on soil systems, and that these impacts can lead to
undesired changes in site productivity, sustainability,
biological diversity, and watershed hydrologic response.
Land managers need to be aware that some changes
in soil systems after fire are quite obvious (for ex-
ample, erosion, loss of organic matter), but others are
subtle and can have equal consequences to the produc-
tivity of a landscape. For example, carbon and N are
the key nutrients affected by burning. The signifi-
cance of these changes is directly tied to the productiv-
ity of a given ecosystem. With a given change in N
capital, the productivity of a nutrient-rich soil system
might not significantly change following burning. A
similar loss in N capital in a nutrient stressed system
could result in a much greater change in productivity.
Recovery of soil nutrient levels after fires can be fairly
slow in some ecosystems, particularly those with lim-
ited N; and in semiarid regions such as the Southwest-
ern United States and Northern Mexico nutrient fixa-
tion and turnover rates are slow.
Summary ______________________
This introductory section to the chapters in part A
has provided information on the general nature of soil
systems, some of the important soil properties, the
character of soil profiles, and important constituents
such as organic matter. It also introduces key concepts
of heat transfer to soils and thresholds for important
soil properties. The three chapters in part A address in
greater detail fire effects on individual physical, chemi-
cal, and biological properties and processes in soil
systems (see chapters 2, 3, and 4, respectively).

Introduction ____________________
Soil physical properties are those characteristics,
processes, or reactions of a soil that are caused by
physical forces that can be described by, or expressed
in, physical terms or equations (Soil Science Society of
America 2001). These physical properties (including
processes) influence the mineral component of the soil
and how it interacts with the other two components
(chemical and biological). Plants depend on the physi-
cal characteristics of soils to provide the medium for
growth and reproduction. Fire can produce significant
changes in the soil that profoundly affect the ecology of
plants (Whelan 1995). The effect of fire on individual
soil physical properties depends on the inherent sta-
bility of the soil property affected and the tempera-
tures to which a soil is heated during a fire. The
physical mechanisms responsible for heat transfer
into soils are also discussed in this chapter along with
the temperatures that develop during different severi-
ties of burning in several wildland ecosystems. The
relationships between soil physical properties affected
by fire and erosional processes are also reviewed.

Soil Physical Characteristics ______
Important physical characteristics in soil that are
affected by soil heating include: texture, clay content,
soil structure, bulk density, and porosity (amount and
size). The threshold temperatures for these soil physi-
cal characteristics are given in table 2.1. Physical
properties such as wettability and structure are af-
fected at relatively low temperatures, while quartz
sand content, which contributes to texture, is affected
least and only at the most extreme soil temperatures.
Soil Texture and Mineralogy
Soil texture is based on the relative proportion of
different-sized inorganic constituents that are found
in the 0.08 inch (less than 2 mm) mineral fraction of
the mineral soil (DeBano and others 1998). Several
soil textural classes have been specified according to
the relative proportions of sand (0.05 to 2 mm in
diameter), silt (0.002 to 0.05 mm in diameter), and clay
(less than 0.002 mm in diameter) particles in the
soil. Various proportions of the sand, silt, and clay

30

fractions are used as the basis for identifying 12
textural classes (for example, sand, sandy loam, clay
loam, silt loam). Clays are small-diameter silicate
minerals having complex molecular structures that
contribute to both the physical and chemical proper-
ties of a soil.
The components of soil texture (sand, silt, and clay)
have high temperature thresholds and are not usually
affected by fire unless they are subjected to high
temperatures at the mineral soil surface (A-horizon).
The most sensitive textural fraction is clay, which
begins changing at soil temperatures of about 752 ∞F
(400 ∞C) when clay hydration and clay lattice structure
begin to collapse. At temperatures of 1,292 to 1,472 ∞F
(700 to 800 ∞C), the complete destruction of internal
clay structure can occur. However, sand and silt are
primarily quartz particles that have a melting point of
2,577 ∞F (1,414 ∞C; Lide 2001). Only under extreme
heating do quartz materials at the soil surface become
fused. When fusion does occur, soil texture becomes
more coarse and erodible. As a result, temperatures
are rarely high enough to alter clays beyond a couple
centimeters below the mineral soil surface. The effect
of soil heating on the stability of clays is further
mitigated by the concentration of clays during soil
development in the B-horizons. These horizons are
usually far removed from heating at the soil surface
and rarely increase above ambient surface tempera-
tures unless heated by smoldering roots.
The effect of soil heating on soil minerals other than
clays has been studied to a limited extent. For example,
a study on the effect of burning logs and slash piles on
soil indicated that substantial changes can occur in the
mineralogy of the underlying soil during severe heating
while burning in juniper (Juniperus spp.) and oak
(Quercus spp.) woodlands (Iglesias and others 1997).
Although changes in minerals occurred in the juniper
stands, they did not occur in the soils under oak.
Followup laboratory burning experiments were done
on calcite formation and the alteration of vermiculite in
the soils collected from the juniper and oak woodland
sites. Temperatures required for calcite formation in
oak soils in the laboratory were found to be 932 ∞F
(500 ∞C) compared to 572 ∞F (300 ∞C) in juniper soils.
Soil Structure
Soil structure has long been recognized as an impor-
tant soil characteristic that can enhance productivity
and water relations in both agricultural and wildland
soils (DeBano and others 1998). Improving soil struc-
ture facilitates the infiltration into and the percolation
of water through the soil profile, thereby reducing
surface runoff and erosion (see chapter 5). The inter-
action of organic matter with mineral soil particles
that create soil structure also increases the cation
adsorption capacities of a soil and nutrient-supplying
capabilities of the soil (see chapter 3).
Soil structure is the arrangement of primary soil
particles into aggregates having distinctive patterns
(columnar, prismatic, blocky). Humus is an impor-
tant component of soil structure because it acts as a
glue that helps hold mineral soil particles together to
form aggregates and thus contributes to soil struc-
ture, particularly in the upper part of the mineral soil
at the duff-upper A-horizon interface (see fig. A.1).
However, further downward in the soil profile (in the
B-horizon), soil structure is more dependent on clay
minerals and the composition of the cations found in
the soil solution.
Soil structure created as a result of organic matter in
the soil can easily be affected by fire for two reasons.
First, the organic matter in a soil profile is concentrated
at, or near, the soil surface where it is directly exposed
to heating by radiation produced during the combustion
of aboveground fuels. Second, the threshold value for
irreversible changes in organic matter is low. Living
organisms can be killed by temperatures as low as 122
to 140 ∞F (50 to 60 ∞C). Nonliving organic matter begins
changing at 224 ∞F (200 ∞C) and is completely lost at
temperatures of 752 ∞F (400 ∞C) (DeBano 1990). The
loss of soil structure reduces both the amount and size
of soil pore space, as is described below.
Soil structure can also be changed by physical pro-
cesses other than fire, such as deformation and com-
pression by freezing and thawing, as well as by wet-
ting and drying. The abundance of cations in saline
and alkali soils can provide an aggregating effect,
leading to a strong prismlike structure. Hydrophobic

substances discussed later in this chapter also tend to
improve the stability of soil aggregates by increasing
their resistance to disintegration (slaking) when wet-
ted (Giovannini and Lucchesi 1983, Giovannini and
others 1983).
Bulk Density and Porosity
Bulk density is the mass of dry soil per unit bulk
volume (expressed in g/cm3) and is related to porosity,
which is the volume of pores in a soil sample (nonsolid
volume) divided by the bulk volume of the sample.
Pore space in soils controls the rates of water (soil
solution) and air movement through the soil. Well-
aggregated soils contain a balance of macropores,
which are greater than 0.02 inch (greater than 0.6
mm) in diameter, and micropores, which are less than
0.02 inch (less than 0.6 mm) in diameter (Singer and
Munns 1996). This balance in pore sizes allows a soil
to transmit both water and air rapidly through
macropores and retain water by capillarity in
micropores. Macropores in the surface soil horizons
are especially important pathways for infiltration of
water into the soil and its subsequent percolation
downward through the soil profile.
Soil aggregation improves soil structure, creates
macropore space, and improves aeration, and as a
result decreases bulk density. Pore space not only
influences the infiltration and percolation of water
through the soil, but the presence of large pores also
facilitates heat transfer by convection, and vaporiza-
tion and condensation.
Fire and associated soil heating can destroy soil
structure, affecting both total porosity and pore size
distribution in the surface horizons of a soil (DeBano
and others 1998). These changes in organic matter
decrease both total porosity and pore size. Loss of
macropores in the surface soil reduces infiltration
rates and produces overland flow. Alteration of or-
ganic matter can also lead to a water repellent soil
condition that further decreases infiltration rates.
The scenario occurring during the destruction of soil
structure by fire is:
•
The soil structure collapses and increases the
density of the soil because the organic matter
that served as a binding agent has been de-
stroyed.
•
The collapse in soil structure reduces soil
porosity (mainly macropores).
•
The soil surface is further compacted by rain-
drops when surface soil particles and ash are
displaced, and surface soil pores become par-
tially or totally sealed.
•
Finally, the impenetrable soil surface reduces
infiltration rates into the soil and produces
rapid runoff and hillslope erosion.
Physical Processes______________
The soil matrix provides the environment that con-
trols several physical processes concerned with heat
flow in soils during a fire. The results of heat transfer
are manifested in the resulting soil temperatures that
develop in the soil profile during a fire (Hartford and
Frandsen 1992). Other soil physical processes affected
by fire are infiltration rates and the heat transfer of
organic substances responsible for water repellency.
Heat Transfer in Soils
The energy generated during the ignition and com-
bustion of fuels provides the driving force that is
responsible for the changes that occur in the physical,
chemical, and biological properties of soils during a
fire (Countryman 1975). Mechanisms responsible for
heat transfer in soils include radiation, conduction,
convection, mass transport, and vaporization and con-
densation (table A.1).
Radiation is defined as the transfer of heat from one
body to another, not in contact with it, by electromag-
netic wave motion (Countryman 1976b). Radiated
energy flows outward in all directions from the emit-
ting substance until it encounters a material capable
of absorbing it. The absorbed radiation energy in-
creases the molecular activity of the absorbing sub-
stance, thereby increasing its temperature.
Conduction is the transfer of heat by molecular
activity from one part of a substance to another part,
or between substances in contact, without appre-
ciable movement or displacement of the substance as
a whole (Countryman 1976a). Metals are generally
good conductors in contrast to dry mineral soil, wood,
and air that conduct heat slowly. Water as a liquid is
a good conductor of heat up to the boiling point, and
has an especially high capacity for storing heat until
it evaporates.
Convection is a process whereby heat is transferred
from one point to another by the mixing of one portion
of a fluid with another fluid (Chandler and others
1991). Heat transfer by convection plays an important
role the rate of fire spread through aboveground fuels.
In soils, however, the complicated air spaces and
interconnections between them provide little opportu-
nity for the movement of heat through the soil by
convection.
Vaporization and condensation are important
coupled heat transfer mechanisms that facilitate the
rapid transfer of heat through dry soils. Vaporization
is the process of adding heat to water until it changes
phase from a liquid to a gas. Condensation occurs
when a gas is changed into a liquid with heat being
released during this process. Both water and organic
materials can be moved through the soil by vaporiza-
tion and condensation.

Heat Transfer Pathways and Models—The heat
that is generated by the combustion of surface and
aboveground fuels is transferred to the mineral soil
surface where it is transferred downward into the under-
lying soil by a series of complex pathways (fig. 2.1).
Quantifying these different pathways for heat flow re-
quires the mathematical modeling of fire behavior, duff
ignition and combustion, and the transfer of heat down-
ward to and through moist and dry mineral soil
(Dimitrakopoulos and others 1994).
The heat radiated downward during the combustion
of aboveground fuels is transferred either to the sur-
face of the forest floor (path A), or directly to the
surface of mineral soil if organic surface layers are
absent (path B). In most forest ecosystems, heat is
usually transferred to an organic layer of litter and
duff (path A). When duff is ignited it can produce
additional heat that is subsequently transferred to the
underlying mineral soil (path D). More details con-
cerning the influence of smoldering and burning duff
on soil heating is presented below. If duff does not
ignite, it does not heat the underlaying mineral soil
(path C). The heat reaching the mineral soil is either
transferred through a dry soil (path E) or a moist soil
(path F). Dry soils are common during wildfires,
whereas prescribed fires can be planned so as to burn
over wet or dry soils. The temperature profiles that
develop during heat transfer into moist and dry min-
eral soil vary widely and as a result affect the physical,
chemical, and biological soil properties differently
(DeBano and others 1998).
The temperature in moist soils does not rise much
above 203 ∞F (95 ∞C) until all the water in a given soil
layer has been vaporized. As a result, most of the
chemical and physical properties of soil are not greatly
affected by heating until the soil becomes dry. How-
ever, irreversible damage to living organisms near the
soil surface is likely to occur because soil temperatures
can easily be elevated above lethal temperatures 140 ∞F
(60 ∞C) for seeds and microorganisms (see part A).
Also, the lethal temperatures for microorganisms are
lower for moist soils than for those that are dry.
The depth that heat penetrates a moist soil depends
on the water content of the soil, and on the magnitude
and duration of the surface heating during the com-
bustion of aboveground fuels, litter, and duff
(Frandsen 1987). During long-duration heating, such
as that occurring under a smoldering duff fire or when
burning slash piles, substantial heating can occur 40
to 50 cm downward in the soil. This prolonged heating
produces temperatures that are lethal to soil organ-
isms and plant roots. Increased thermal conductivity
of moist soil may also create lethal temperatures at
much deeper soil depths than if the soil was dry, due
to increased thermal conductivity.
Organic-Rich Soils—Organic matter-rich soils are
created when the primary productivity exceeds de-
composition. Organic matter accumulations can vary
from thick surface duff layers located mainly on the
soil surface to deep deposits of peat that have been
accumulating for thousands of years. The ignition and
combustion of these organic-rich soils is of global
concern because of the magnitude and duration of
these fires and because of the severity of soil heating
that occurs during these types of fires (fig. 2.2). The
primary combustion process during these fires is by
smoldering. The role of fires in wetlands is discussed
further in chapter 8 of this publication.
General fire relationships: Although peatland soils
are usually saturated, they can dry out during drought
periods and become highly combustible. The fires that
occur in peatland soils can be extremely long lasting
and cover extensive areas where contiguous deposits
of peat are present. Such was the case for one of the
largest and longest burning fires in the world that
occurred in Kalimantan, Indonesia (Kilmaskossu 1988,

DeBano and others 1998). This fire was started during
drought season when the farmers were clearing an
area of logging slash by burning before planting agri-
cultural crops. The fire started in 1983 and burned
unchecked more-or-less continuously until the later
part of the 1990s. The entire burn covered an area of
over 8.4 million acres (3.4 million ha).
Although a thick accumulation of organic matter is
commonly associated with tropical and semitropical
ecosystems, the largest areas of organic soils are
actually found in the boreal regions of the world.
Although conditions are usually cool and moist in
boreal forests, fires can occur periodically in underly-
ing wetland soils during low rainfall years, at which
time these fires mostly burn only the drier surface
layers (Wein 1983). The combustion of peatland soils
in the boreal forests during wildfires that are started
by lightning have been identified as a major source of
CO2 that is released into the atmosphere. It has been
estimated that greater than 20 percent of the atmo-
spheric emissions linked to global warming are caused
by these fires in the boreal forests worldwide (Conard
and Ivanova 1997). During 1980s alone, more than
138.3 million acres (56 million ha) of boreal forest were
estimated to have burned globally (Stocks 1991). Re-
search is currently under way to develop better meth-
ods for quantifying the amounts of organic matter lost
as the result of wildland fires in peatlands (Turetsky
and Wieder 2001).
Soil heating pathways: When dealing with the com-
bustion of organic soils it is important to understand
the processes that sustain combustion. The heat pro-
duced by the combustion of aboveground fuels can be
transferred to the duff (path A, fig. 2.1). Duff (or thick
organic layers) can act as an insulating layer when it
does not ignite (path C), or a heat source when it
ignites, combusts, and continues smoldering (path D).
Therefore, the amount of heat transferred into the
underlying mineral soil depends on whether the duff
burns and whether the smoldering duff acts as a long-
term source of heat. The ignition and combustion of
the duff is complex, and attempts to correlate it with
heat produced during slash burning have been largely
unsuccessful (Albini 1975). Although the duff compli-
cates the heat transfer from the burning aboveground
fuels into the underlying mineral soil, some features
controlling duff ignition and combustion are known.
Important variables needed to describe heat produc-
tion in duff include depth, total amount, density of
packing, the amount of inorganic constituents
present, and the moisture content.
If duff does not burn, it provides a barrier to heat
flow because the thermal conductivity of organic mat-
ter is low (path C, fig. 2.1). The probability of ignition
in organic soils (including duff) depends on both inor-
ganic constituents and moisture content (Hungerford
and others 1995b). Organic soils are not necessarily
completely organic matter, but instead they may con-
tain variable amounts of mineral soil as a result of
mixing by surface disturbance. The chances of ignition
in organic soils decrease as mineral content increases
at any given moisture content. Likewise, the chances
of ignition of organic soil decrease as moisture content
increases at any given mineral content. In general,
duff burns more efficiently when the moisture content
is below 30 percent. Varying amounts will burn at
moisture contents from 30 to 150 percent, and it is too
wet to burn when moisture contents exceed 150 per-
cent (Brown and others 1985). Moisture affects both
the thermal conductivity and the heat capacity of the
duff, which in turn affect its ignitability (Hungerford
1990).
Combustion of the duff and thick organic deposits
such as peat soils involves a smoldering reaction that
is initiated by the ignition of a spot or several spots by
fire brands, hot ash material, or radiated and con-
ducted heat from the fire front (Pyne and others 1996).
After duff ignites, it can transfer large amounts of heat
into the underlying soil by convection, conduction, and
radiation, and can raise the mineral soil above 350 ∞C
for several hours. Therefore, it becomes difficult to
quantify this combined heat flow into the underlying
mineral soil. When thick layers of organic materials
ignite, glowing combustion can also create an ash
layer on the surface of the glowing duff. This ash layer
retards heat dissipation upward, thereby causing more
heat to penetrate into the soil (Sackett and Haase
1992). As a result, organic layers can transfer 40 to 73
percent of the heat generated during the smoldering
process into the underlying mineral soil (Hungerford
and Ryan 1996). The ignition, smoldering, and com-
bustion of thick duff layers can continue for hours,
thereby allowing substantial time for heat to be trans-
ferred deeply into the soil.

A duff burnout model: Combustion in duff (duff
burnout) and organic soils was summarized by
Hungerford and others (1995a,b). Ignition is initiated
at a single point or several locations on the surface duff
(fig. 2.3). Ignition can also occur in cracks or depres-
sions in duff, or be caused by woody material that
burns downward through the duff (fig. 2.3A). Fire
burns both laterally and vertically after ignition (fig.
2.3B). Fire will burn laterally until it encounters
incombustible conditions (moist organic matter, rocks,
or the absence of duff). It burns vertically until it
reaches mineral soil or moisture conditions that will
not support combustion. During the smoldering of the
fire, a hole develops in the burned-out organic layer.
Horizontal spread of the fire can leave a thin unburned
top crust (Pyne and others 1996). As the smoldering
zone moves laterally and vertically, it creates a drying
zone caused by the heat from the glowing zone, which
allows the glowing front to advance until it reaches
incombustible conditions (fig. 2.3C).
Soil Temperature Profiles—Heat absorption and
transfer in soils produce elevated temperatures
throughout the soil. Temperature increases near the
surface are greatest, and they are the least downward
in the soil. These temperature regimes are called
temperature profiles and can be highly variable de-
pending mainly on the amount of soil water present.
Dry soils are poor conductors of heat and thereby do
not heat substantially below about 2 inches (5 cm)
unless heavy long-burning fuels are combusted. In
contrast, wet soils conduct heat rapidly via the soil
water although temperatures remain at the boiling
point of water until most of the water has been lost.
The final soil temperatures reached vary considerably
between fires (different fires may produce similar soil
temperatures, and conversely, similar fires can pro-
duce widely different soil temperatures) and within
fires because of heterogeneous surface temperatures.
Numerous reports describing soil temperatures dur-
ing fire under a wide range of vegetation types and fuel
arrangements are present in the literature. As a point
of reference, some typical soil temperature profiles are
presented for different severities of fire in grass, chap-
arral, and forests.
Soil temperature increases generated during a cool-
burning prescribed fire in mixed conifer forests are low
and of short duration (fig. 2.4). This type of fire would

process. The initial ignition point is created by the
passing fire front. The fire spreads concentrically from
the ignition point (A), develops concentric burned areas
(B), and finally develops into a large burned out area
(C). (Adapted from Hungerford and others 1995b).

be carried by the surface litter and would probably not
consume much standing vegetation, although it might
affect some smaller seedlings.
Fire behavior during brush fires, however, differs
widely from that occurring during prescribed burning
in forests. Both wildfires and prescribed fires in brush
fields need to be carried through the plant canopy. The
difference between wild and prescribed fires is mainly
the amount and rate at which the plant canopy is
consumed. During wildfires, the entire plant canopy
can be consumed within a matter of seconds, and large
amounts of heat that are generated by the combustion
of the aboveground fuels are transmitted to the soil
surface and into the underlying soil. In contrast, brush
can be prescribe-burned under cooler burning condi-
tions (for example, higher fuel moisture contents,
lower wind speeds, higher humidity, lower ambient
temperatures, using northerly aspects) such that fire
behavior is less explosive. Under these cooler burning
conditions the shrub canopy may be not be entirely
consumed, and in some cases a mosaic burn pattern
may be created (particularly on north-facing slopes).
The soil temperature profiles that were measured
during low, medium, and high severity fires in chapar-
ral vegetation in southern California are presented in
figure 2.5A, B, and C.
The highest soil temperatures are reached when
concentrated fuels such as slash piles and thick layers
of duff burn for long periods (fig. 2.6A and B). The soil
temperatures under a pile of burning eucalyptus logs
(fig. 2.6A) reached lethal temperatures for most living
biota at a depth of almost 22 cm in the mineral soil
(after Roberts 1965). In must be kept in mind, how-
ever, that this extreme soil heating occurred on only a
small fraction of the area, although the visual effects
on plant growth were observed for several years. An

example of extensive soil heating that can occur dur-
ing the burning of areas having large accumulations of
duff and humus (fig. 2.6B) was reported during the
complete combustion of 2.8 inches (7 cm) of a duff layer
found under larch (Hungerford 1990).
Based on the information available on the relation-
ship between soil heating and type of fire, the follow-
ing generalities can be made:
•
Crown fires are fast-moving, wind-driven,
large, impressive, and usually uncontrollable,
and they have a deep flame front (fig. 1.3).
Usually little soil heating results when a fire
front passes mainly through the tree crowns.
•
Surface fires, compared to crown fires, are
slower moving, smaller, patchy, and are more
controllable, and they may also have a deep
flame front (fig. 2.7A). These fires usually
ignite and combust a large portion of the
surface fuels in forests and brushlands that
can produce substantial soil heating.
•
Grass fires are fast-moving and wind-driven,
may be large, and have a narrow flame front
(fig. 2.7B). The amount of fuel available for
burning in grasslands is usually much less
than that contained in brushlands and forests,
and as a result, soil heating is substantially less
than occurs during surface or smoldering fires.
•
Smoldering fires do not have flames, are slow-
moving and unimpressive, but frequently have
long burnout times. They generally are con-
trollable although they may have a deep burn-
ing front. Soil heating during this long dura-
tion smoldering process may be substantial.
Temperatures within smoldering duff often
are between 932 and 1,112 ∞F (500 and 600 ∞C).
The duration of burning may last from 18 to 36
hours, producing high temperatures in the
underlying mineral soil.
Water Repellency
The creation of water repellency in soils involves both
physical and chemical processes. It is discussed within
the context of physical properties because of its impor-
tance in modifying physical processes such as infiltra-
tion and water movement in soils. Although hydropho-
bic soils had been observed since the early 1900s (DeBano
2000a,b), fire-induced water repellency was first iden-
tified on burned chaparral watersheds in southern
California in the early1960s. Watershed scientists were
aware of it earlier, but it had been referred to simply as
the “tin roof” effect because of its effect on infiltration
(fig. 2.8A, B, and C). In southern California both the
production of a fire-induced water repellency and the
loss of protective vegetative cover play a major role in
the postfire runoff and erosion, and the area is parti-
cularly important because of the large centers of

rosa pine forest, Mogollon Rim, Arizona, and (B) Alas-
kan grasslands. (Photos by USDA Forest Service).

searchers include (A) the wettable ash and carbon

layer, and (C) the wettable subsoil. (After DeBano

populations located immediately below steep, unstable
chaparral watersheds.
Nature of Water Repellency in Soils—Normally,
dry soils have an affinity for adsorbing liquid and
vapor water because there is strong attraction be-
tween the mineral soil particles and water. In water-
repellent soils, however, the water droplet “beads up”
on the soil surface where it can remain for long periods
and in some cases will evaporate before being ab-
sorbed by the soil. Water, however, will not penetrate
some soils because the mineral particles are coated
with hydrophobic substances that repel water. Water
repellency has been characterized by measuring the
contact angle between the water droplet and the wa-
ter-repellent soil surface. Wettable dry soils have a
liquid-solid contact angle of nearly zero degrees. In
contrast, water-repellent soils have liquid-solid con-
tact angles around 90 degrees (fig. 2.9).
Causes of Water Repellency—Water repellency
is produced by soil organic matter and can be found in
both fire and nonfire environments (DeBano 2000a,b).
Water repellency can result from the following pro-
cesses involving organic matter:
•
An irreversible drying of the organic matter
(for example, rewetting dried peat).
•
The coating of mineral soil particles with
leachates from organic materials (for example,
coarse-grained materials treated with plant
extracts).
•
The coating of soil particles with hydrophobic
microbial byproducts (for example, fungal
mycelium).
•
The intermixing of dry mineral soil particles
and dry organic matter.

heat-induced water repellency).
Formation of Fire-Induced Water-Repellent
Soils— A hypothesis by DeBano (1981) describes how
a water-repellent layer is formed beneath the soil
surface during a fire, noting that organic matter accu-
mulates on the soil surface under vegetation canopies
during the intervals between fires. During fire-free
intervals, water repellency occurs mainly in the or-
ganic-rich surface layers, particularly when they are
proliferated with fungal mycelium (fig. 2.10A). Heat
produced during the combustion of litter and
aboveground fuels vaporizes organic substances, which
are then moved downward into the underlying min-
eral soil where they condense in the cooler underlying
soil layers (fig. 2.10B) The layer where these vaporized
hydrophobic substances condense forms a distinct
water-repellent layer below and parallel to the soil
surface (fig. 2.10C).
The magnitude of fire-induced water repellency de-
pends upon several parameters, including:
•
The severity of the fire. The more severe the
fire, the deeper the layer, unless the fire is so
hot it destroys the surface organic matter.
•
Type and amount of organic matter present.
Most vegetation and fungal mycelium contain
hydrophobic compounds that induce water
repellency.
•
Temperature gradients in the upper mineral
soil. Steep temperature gradients in dry soil
enhance the downward movement of volatil-
ized hydrophobic substances.
•
Texture of the soil. Early studies in California
chaparral showed that sandy and coarse-tex-
tured soils were the most susceptible to fire-
induced water repellency (DeBano 1981). How-
ever, more recent studies indicate that water
repellency frequently occurs in soils other than
coarse-textured ones (Doerr and others 2000).
•
Water content of the soil. Soil water affects
the translocation of hydrophobic substances
during a fire because it affects heat transfer
and the development of steep temperature
gradients.
Effect of Water Repellency on Postfire Ero-
sion—Fire affects water entering the soil in two ways.
First, the burned soil surface is unprotected from
raindrop impact that loosens and disperses fine soil
and ash particles that can seal the soil surface. Second,
soil heating during a fire produces a water-repellent
layer at or near the soil surface that further impedes
infiltration into the soil. The severity of the water
repellency in the surface soil layer, however, decreases
Figure 2.9—Appearance of water droplets that are
“balled up” on a water-repellent soil. (After DeBano
1981).

over time as it is exposed to moisture; in many cases,
it does not substantially affect infiltration beyond the
first year. More detailed effects of water repellency on
the infiltration process are discussed in chapter 6.
Water repellency has a particularly important effect
on two postfire erosion processes, that of raindrop
splash and rill formation.
Raindrop splash: When a water-repellent layer is
formed at the soil surface, the hydrophobic particles
are more sensitive to raindrop splash than those
present on a wettable soil surface (Terry and Shakesby
1993). Consequently, raindrops falling on a hydropho-
bic surface produce fewer, slower moving ejection
droplets that carry more sediment a shorter distance
than in the case of a wettable soil. Further, the wet-
table surfaces have an affinity for water and thereby
become sealed and compacted during rainfall, which
makes them increasingly resistant to splash detach-
ment. Conversely, the hydrophobic soil remains dry
and noncohesive; particles are easily displaced by
splash when the raindrop breaks the surrounding
water film.
Rill formation: A reduction in infiltration caused by
a water-repellent layer quickly causes highly visible
rainfall-runoff-erosion patterns to develop on the steep
slopes of burned watersheds. The increased surface
runoff resulting from a water-repellent layer quickly
entrains loose particles of soil and organic debris, and
produces surface runoff that rapidly becomes concen-
trated into well-defined rills. As a result, extensive rill
networks develop when rainfall exceeds the slow infil-
tration rates that are characteristic of water-repellent
soils.
The sequence of rill formation as a result of fire-
induced water repellency has been documented to fol-
low several well-defined stages (Wells 1987). First, the
wettable soil surface layer, if present, is saturated
during initial infiltration (fig. 2.11A). Water infiltrates

rapidly into the wettable surface ash layer until it is
impeded by a water-repellent layer. This process occurs
uniformly over the landscape so that when the wetting
front reaches the water-repellent layer, it can neither
drain downward or laterally (fig. 2.11A). If the water-
repellent soil layer is on the soil surface, runoff begins
immediately after rain droplets reach the soil surface.
As rainfall continues, water fills all available pores
until the wettable soil layer becomes saturated. Be-
cause of the underlying water-repellent layer, the satu-
rated pores cannot drain, which creates a positive pore
pressure above the water-repellent layer. This increased
pore pressure decreases the shear strength of the soil
mass and produces a failure zone located at the bound-
ary between the wettable and water-repellent layers
where pore pressures are greatest (fig. 2.11B). As the
water flows down this initial failure zone, turbulent
flow develops, which accelerates erosion and entrains
particles from both the wettable ash layer if present and
the water-repellent layer (fig. 2.11C and 2.11D). The
downward erosion of the water-repellent rill continues
until the water-repellent layer is eroded away and
water begins infiltrating into the underlying wettable
soil. Flow then diminishes, turbulence is reduced, and
down-cutting ceases. The final result is a rill that has
stabilized immediately below the water-repellent layer
(fig.2.11E). On a watershed basis these individual rills
develop into a well-defined network that can extend
throughout a small watershed (fig. 2.11F).

of wettable surface area, (B) development of a failure zone in wettable surface layer, (C) free flowing water over
the water-repellent layer, (D) erosion of the water-repellent layer, (E) removal of the water repellent layer and
infiltration into underlying wettable soil, and (F) resultant rill. (From Wells 1987. The effects of fire on the

Soil Erosion ____________________
Processes and Mechanics
The erosion process involves three separate compo-
nents that are a function of sediment size and transport
medium (water or air) velocity. These are: (1) detach-
ment, (2) transport, and (3) deposition. Erosion occurs
when sediments are exposed to water or air and
velocities are sufficient to detach and transport the
sediments. Table 2.2 gives a generalized breakdown of
sediment classes and detachment/transport/deposi-
tion velocities in water.
Erosion is a natural process occurring on landscapes
at different rates and scales depending on geology,
topography, vegetation, and climate. Natural rates of
erosion are shown in table 2.3. Geologic erosion rates
were calculated on large basins so they are higher than
those listed for forests. The data from forests come
from much smaller watershed experiments. Natural
erosion rates increase as annual precipitation in-
creases, peaking in semiarid ecoregions when moving
from desert to wet forest (Hudson 1981). This occurs
because there is sufficient rainfall to cause natural
erosion from the sparser desert and semiarid grass-
land covers. As precipitation continues to increase,
the landscapes start supporting dry and eventually
wet forests, which produce increasingly dense plant
and litter covers that decrease natural erosion. How-
ever, if the landscapes are denuded by disturbance
(for example, fire, grazing, timber harvesting, and
so forth), then the rate of erosion continues to in-
crease with increasing precipitation (fig. 2.12). Sur-
face conditions after fire are important for deter-
mining where water moves and how much erosion is
produced (table 2.4).

Erosion is certainly the most visible and dramatic
impact of fire apart from the consumption of vegeta-
tion. Fire management activities (wildfire suppres-
sion, prescribed fire, and postfire watershed rehabili-
tation) can affect erosion processes in wildland
ecosystems. Wildfire, fireline construction, temporary
roads, and permanent, unpaved roads receiving heavy
vehicle traffic will increase erosion. Increased
stormflows after wildfires will also increase erosion
rates. Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER)
work on watersheds will decrease potential postfire
erosion to varying degrees depending on the timing
and intensity of rainfall (see chapter 10; Robichaud
and others 2000).
Sheet, Rill, and Gully Erosion: Progressive
Erosion—In sheet erosion, slope surfaces erode uni-
formly. This type proceeds to rill erosion in which
small, linear, rectangular channels cut into the sur-
face of a slope. Further redevelopment of rills leads to
the formation of deep, large, rectangular to v-shaped
channels (gullys) cut into a slope (fig. 2.13).
Some special erosion conditions can be encountered.
For instance, in ecoregions with permafrost, the pro-
gression of erosion from sheet to rill to gully interacts
with the depth of permafrost thaw. Until thaw occurs,
erosion is essentially frozen. Fire and fire control
activities such as fireline construction will affect thaw
depth after wildfires, and subsequent erosion of
firelines can be substantial (fig. 2.14).
Dry Ravel—Dry ravel is the gravity-induced
downslope surface movement of soil grains, aggre-
gates, and rock material, and is a ubiquitous process in
semiarid steepland ecosystems (Anderson and others
1959). Triggered by animal activity, earthquakes, wind,
freeze-thaw cycles, and thermal grain expansion dur-
ing soil heating and cooling, dry ravel may best be

described as a type of dry grain flow (Wells 1981). Fires
greatly alter the physical characteristics of hillside
slopes, stripping them of their protective cover of
vegetation and organic litter and removing barriers
that were trapping sediment. Consequently, during
and immediately following fires, large quantities of
surface material are liberated and move downslope as
dry ravel (Krammes 1960, Rice 1974). Dry ravel can
equal or exceed rainfall-induced hillslope erosion after
fire in chaparral ecosystems (Krammes 1960,
Wohlgemuth and others 1998).
In the Oregon Coast Range, Bennett (1982) found
that prescribed fires in heavy slash after clearcutting
produced noncohesive soils that were less resistant to
the force of gravity. Dry ravel on steep slopes (greater
than 60 percent) that were prescribed burned pro-
duced 118 yard3/acre (224 m3/ha) of surface erosion
compared to 15 yard3/acre (29 m3/ha) on moderate
slopes with burning, and 9 yard3/acre (17 m3/ha) where
burning was not done after clearcutting. Sixty-four
percent of the erosion, as dry ravel, occurred within
the first 24 hours after burning.
Mass Failures—This term includes slope creep,
falls, topples, rotational and translational slides, lat-
eral spreads, debris flows, and complex movements
(Varnes 1978). Slope creep is a slow process that does
not deliver large amounts of sediment to stream chan-
nels in the periods normally considered in natural
resources management. The most important for forest
management considerations are rotational and trans-
lational slides, flows, and complex movement (Ice
1985). Slump-earthflows and debris avalanches are
more likely with increased water in the soil because of
the decreased tension between soil particles, increased

loading on slopes produced by excess soil water, and a
buoyant effect created by soil water along a failure
plane. These types of failures are most often associ-
ated with clearcutting, tree death due to disease or
insects, and road network construction. Slope failures
associated with fires are the result of the loss of the
forest floor, surface sealing, and the development of
water repellency. These processes produce a diversion
of rainfall from infiltration to surface runoff. The
result is a dramatic increase in debris torrents in
channels that greatly increase sediment delivery to
channels and flooding (see chapter 5).
Debris avalanches are the largest, most dramatic,
and main form of mass wasting that delivers sediment
to streams (Benda and Cundy 1990). They can range
from slow moving earth flows to rapid avalanches of
soil, rock, and woody debris. Debris avalanches occur
when the mass of soil material and soil water exceed
the sheer strength needed to maintain the mass in
place. The loss of root strength (for example, soil
strength, anchoring, soil mass cohesion, and so forth)
due to removal of trees or tree death caused by insects
or disease aggravates the situation. Steep slopes,
logging, road construction, and heavy rainfall aggra-
vate debris avalanching potential (table 2.5).
Most fire-associated mass failures are debris flows
associated with development of water repellency in
soils (DeBano and others 1998). Chaparral occupying
steep slopes in southern California has a high poten-
tial for mass failures, particularly when deep-rooted
chaparral species are replaced with shallower-rooted
grass species (Rice 1974). These mass failures are a
large source of sediment delivered to stream channels
(can be 50 percent of the total postfire sediment yield
in some ecoregions; fig. 2.15). Wells (1981) reported
that wildfire in chaparral vegetation in coastal south-
ern California can increase average debris avalanche
sediment delivery in large watersheds from 18 to
4,845 yard3/mile2/year (7 to 1,910 m3/km2/year). How-
ever, individual storm events in smaller basins can
trigger much greater sediment yields (Gartner and
others 2004; table 2.6). Rates as high as 221,026 yard3/
mile2 (65,238 m3/km2) have been measured after single
storms in California chaparral. Other ecoregions in
the Western United States have postfire debris flows
that have been larger (for example, 304,761 yard3/
mile2or 89,953 m3/km2 in ecoregion M331, Colorado)
but not with the same frequency (table 2.6). The
situation could change with the increasing severity,
frequency, and distribution of forest wildfires that
have characterized the past decade.

est, Arizona. (Photo courtesy of the Tree
Ring Laboratory, University of Arizona).
Cannon (2001) describes several types of debris flow
initiation mechanisms after wildfires in the South-
western United States. Of these, surface runoff, which
increases sediment entrainment, was the dominant
triggering mechanism. Campbell and others (1977)
reported a 416-fold increase in sediment yield after
wildfire in southwestern ponderosa pine.
Channel Stability—Fire-related sediment yields
vary, depending on fire frequency, climate, vegetation,
and geomorphic factors such as topography, geology,
and soils (Swanson 1981). In some regions, more than
60 percent of the total landscape sediment production
over the long term is fire-related. Much of that sedi-
ment loss can occur the first year after a wildfire (Rice
1974, Agee 1993, DeBano and others 1996, DeBano
and others 1998, Wohlgemuth and others 1998,
Robichaud and Brown 1999).
A stable stream channel reflects a dynamic equilib-
rium between incoming and outgoing sediment and
streamflow (Rosgen 1996). Increased sideslope ero-
sion after fires can alter this equilibrium by transport-
ing additional sediment into channels (aggradation).
Here it is stored until increased peakflows (see chap-
ter 5) produced after fires erode the channel (degrada-
tion) and move the stored material downstream (Heede
and others 1988). Sediment transported from burned
areas as a result of increased peakflows can adversely
affect aquatic habitat, recreation areas, roads, build-
ings, bridges, and culverts. Deposition of sediments
alters habitat and can fill in lakes and reservoirs (Reid
1993, Rinne 1996).

Postfire Sediment Yields
Baseline Yields—Some reference sediment yield
baselines are presented in tables 2.3, 2.5, and 2.6.
Natural erosion rates for undisturbed forests in the
Western United States of less than 0.01 to 2.47 tons/
acre/year (less than 0.01 to 5.53 Mg/ha/year) are higher
than Eastern United States yields of 0.05 to 0.10 tons/
acre/year (0.1 to 0.2 Mg/ha/year) but don’t approach
the upper limit of geologic erosion (Maxwell and Neary
1991). These differences are due to natural site factors
such as soil and geologic erosivity, rates of geologic
uplift, tectonic activity, slope, rainfall amount and
intensity, vegetation density and percent cover, and
fire frequency. Landscape-disturbing activities such
as mechanical site preparation (6.7 tons/acre; 15 Mg/
ha/year; Neary and Hornbeck 1994), agriculture (249.8
tons/acre; 560 Mg/ha/year; Larson and others 1983),
and road construction (62.4 tons/acre; 140 Mg/ha/year;
Swift 1984) produce the most sediment loss and can
match or exceed the upper limit of natural geologic
erosion.
Yields from Fires—Fire-related sediment yields
vary considerably, depending on fire frequency, cli-
mate, vegetation, and geomorphic factors such as
topography, geology, and soils (Anderson and others
1976, Swanson 1981). In some regions, over 60 percent
of the total landscape sediment production over the
long term is fire-related. Much of that sediment loss
can occur the first year after a wildfire (Rice 1974,
Agee 1993, DeBano and others 1996, DeBano and
others 1998, Wohlgemuth and others 1998, Robichaud
and Brown 1999). An example is the large amount of
sediment that filled in a 10 acre (4 ha) lake on the
Coronado National Forest after the Rattlesnake Fire
of 1996 (fig. 2.16). Tables 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, and 2.10 show
the range of sediment yield increases from the first

year after prescribed burns and wildfires. Sediment
yields 1 year after prescribed burns and wildfires
range from very low, in flat terrain and in the absence
of major rainfall events, to extreme, in steep terrain
affected by high intensity thunderstorms. Erosion on
burned areas typically declines in subsequent years as
the site stabilizes, but the rate of recovery varies
depending on burn or fire severity and vegetation
recovery.
Soil erosion following fires can vary from under 0.1
tons/acre/year (0.1 Mg/ha/year) to 6.7 tons/acre/year
(15 Mg/ha/year) in prescribed burns, and from less
than 0.1 tons/acre (less than 0.1 Mg/ha/year) in low-
severity wildfire, to more than 164.6 tons/acre/year
(369 Mg/ha/year) in high-severity wildfires on steep
slopes (Hendricks and Johnson 1944, Megahan and
Molitor 1975, Neary and Hornbeck 1994, Robichaud
and Brown 1999). For example, Radek (1996) observed
erosion of 0.13 tons/acre/year (0.3 Mg/ha/year) to 0.76
tons/acre/year (1.7 Mg/ha/year) from several large
wildfires that covered areas ranging from 494 to 4,370
acres (200 to 1,770 ha) in the northern Cascades
Mountains. Three years after these fires, large ero-
sional events occurred from spring rainstorms, not
from snowmelt. Most of the sediment produced did not
leave the burned area. Sartz (1953) reported an aver-
age soil loss of 1.5 inch (37 mm) after a wildfire on a
north-facing slope in the Oregon Cascades. Raindrop
splash and sheet erosion accounted for the measured
soil loss. Annual precipitation was 42.1 inches (1,070
mm), with a maximum intensity of 3.54 inch/hour (90
mm/hour). Vegetation covered the site within 1 year
after the burn. Robichaud and Brown (1999) reported
first-year erosion rates after a wildfire from 0.5 to 1.1
tons/acre (1.1 to 2.5 Mg/ha/year), decreasing by an
order of magnitude by the second year, and to no

sediment by the fourth, in an unmanaged forest stand
in eastern Oregon. DeBano and others (1996) found
that following a wildfire in ponderosa pine, sediment
yields from a low severity fire recovered to normal
levels after 3 years, but moderate and severely burned
watersheds took 7 and 14 years, respectively. Nearly
all fires increase sediment yield, but wildfires in steep
terrain produce the greatest amounts, 12.5 to164.8
tons/acre/year (28 to more than 369 Mg/ha/year). Noble
and Lundeen (1971) reported an average annual sedi-
ment production rate of 2.5 tons/acre (5.7 Mg/ha) from
a 902 acre (365 ha) burn on steep river breaklands in
the South Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho. This rate
was approximately seven times greater than hillslope
sediment yields from similar, unburned lands in the
vicinity.
Sediment yields usually are the highest the first
year after a fire and then decline in subsequent years.
However, if precipitation is below normal, the peak
sediment delivery year might be delayed until years 2
or 3. In semiarid areas like the Southwest, postfire
sediment transport is episodic in nature, and the delay
may be longer. All fires increase sediment yield, but it
is wildfire that produces the largest amounts. Slope is
a major factor in determining the amount of sediment
yielded during periods of rainfall following fire (see table
2.10). There is growing evidence that short-duration,
high-intensity rainfall (greater than 50 mm/hour in
10- to-15 minute bursts) over areas of about 1 km2
(247 acres) often produce the flood flows that result in
large amounts of sediment transport (Neary and

Best Management Practices certainly have value in
reducing sediment losses from prescribed fires.
O’Loughlin and others (1980) reported that a 66 foot
(20 m) buffer strip in a steep watershed reduced
sediment loss after prescribed fire from 800 percent of
the control watershed to 142 percent. Mitigative tech-
niques for reducing sediment losses after wildfires
often are used as part of burned area emergency
watershed rehabilitation, but they have their limita-
tions (see chapter 10).
After fires, turbidity can increase due to the suspen-
sion of ash and silt-to-clay-sized soil particles in

streamflow. Turbidity is an important water quality
parameter because high turbidity reduces municipal
water quality and can adversely affect fish and other
aquatic organisms (see chapter 7). It is often the most
easily visible water quality effect of fires (DeBano and
others 1998). Less is known about turbidity than
sedimentation in general because it is difficult to
measure, highly transient, and extremely variable.
Extra coarse sediments (sand, gravel, boulders)
transported off of burned areas or as a result of in-
creased storm peakflows can adversely affect aquatic
habitat, recreation areas, and reservoirs. Deposition of
coarse sediments destroys aquatic and riparian habitat
and fills in lakes or reservoirs (Reid 1993, Rinne 1996).

Management Implications ________
Resource managers need to be aware of the changes
in the physical properties that occur in the soil during
a fire. The most important physical process func-
tioning during a fire is the transfer of heat into the
soil. Soil heating not only affects soil physical prop-
erties but also changes many of the chemical and
biological properties in soils described in chapters 3
and 4, respectively.
Wildfires present their own unique concerns. Al-
though little can be done to modify soil heating during
a wildfire, managers need to be aware of the suscepti-
bility of severely burned areas to postfire runoff and
erosion. Excessive heating of the underlying soils
during these uncontrollable fires can change soil struc-
ture to such an extent that water infiltration is im-
peded, creating excessive runoff and erosion following
fire. Formation of water repellent soils during these
wildfires may present special concerns with erosion
following wildfires and needs to be addressed when
initiating postfire treatments. Postfire rehabilitation
is an important activity on areas burned by wildfire
where it is necessary to reestablish plant cover as soon
as possible to protect the bare soil surface from rain-
drop impact. However, discretion is needed in order to
apply the most effective and practical postfire reha-
bilitation treatments. Numerous revegetation tech-
niques that are available for use on burned water-
sheds are discussed in chapter 10 of this publication
and elsewhere (Robichaud and others 2000).
The use of prescribed fire, however, presents the
manager with alternatives for minimizing the damage
done to the soil. The least amount of damage occurs
during cool-burning, low-severity fires. These fires do
not heat the soil substantially, and the changes in
most soil properties are only minor and are of short
duration. However, the burning of concentrated fuels
(for example, slash, large woody debris) can cause
substantial damage to the soil resource, although
these long-term effects are limited to only a small
proportion of the landscape where the fuels are piled.
These types of fire use should be avoided whenever
possible. The burning of organic soils is also a special
case where extensive damage can occur unless burn-
ing prescriptions are carefully planned.
Summary ______________________
The physical processes occurring during fires are
complex and include both heat transfer and the associ-
ated change in soil physical characteristics. The most
important soil physical characteristic affected by fire is
soil structure because the organic matter component
can be lost at relatively low temperatures. The loss of
soil structure increases the bulk density of the soil and
reduces its porosity, thereby reducing soil productivity
and making the soil more vulnerable to postfire runoff
and erosion. Although heat is transferred in the soil by
several mechanisms, its movement by vaporization and
condensation is the most important. The result of heat
transfer in the soil is an increase in soil temperature
that affects the physical, chemical, and biological prop-
erties of the soil. When organic substances are moved
downward in the soil by vaporization and condensation
they can cause a water-repellent soil condition that
further accentuates postfire runoff and erosion. Water
repellency accelerates postfire runoff, which in turn
creates extensive networks of surface rill erosion. Wa-
ter repellency also increases erosion by raindrop splash.
The magnitude of change in soil physical properties
depends on the temperature threshold of the soil prop-
erties and the severity of the fire. The greatest change
in soil physical properties occurs when smoldering fires
burn for long periods.

Introduction ____________________
The chemical properties of the soil that are affected
by fire include individual chemical characteristics,
chemical reactions, and chemical processes (DeBano
and others 1998). The soil chemical characteristics
most commonly affected by fire are organic matter,
carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S),
cations, cation exchange capacity, pH, and buffer power.
Some purely chemical reactions occur in soils. These
include the exchange of cations adsorbed on the sur-
face of mineral soil particles and humus with their
surrounding solutions. Another predominately chemi-
cal reaction is the chemical weathering of rocks and
their eventual transformation into secondary clay
minerals during soil formation. During the chemical
decomposition of rock material, the soil and its sur-
rounding solution become enriched with several cat-
ions. Associated with the chemical interactions during
weathering and soil formation are physical forces
(freezing and thawing, wetting and drying) and bio-
logical activities (production of organic acids during
the decomposition of humus) that also accelerate soil
development. The most common chemical processes
occurring in soils that are affected by fire, however, are
those mechanisms that are involved in nutrient avail-
ability and the losses and additions of nutrients to the
soil.

Chapter 3:
Soil Chemistry
Soil Chemical
Characteristics _________________
The chemical characteristics of soils range from the
inorganic cations—for example, calcium (Ca), sodium
(Na), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), and so forth—
that are adsorbed on the surface of clay materials to
those contained mainly within the organic matrix of
the soil—for example, organic matter, C, N, P, S. All
chemical characteristics are affected by fire, although
the temperatures at which changes occur can vary
widely. The best estimates available in the literature
for the threshold temperatures of individual soil chemi-
cal characteristics are given in table 3.1.
The published information describing the effects of
fire on changes in individual chemical constituents of
soils and organic matter are contradictory and have
often led to differing conclusions about the magni-
tude and importance of the chemical changes that
actually occur during a fire. Different studies have
concluded that soil chemical constituents increase,
decrease, or remain the same (DeBano and others
1998). This has been particularly true for studies
reporting changes in N   and other nutrients that can
volatilize readily during a fire (for example, organic
matter, sulfur, and phosphorus). Differing conclu-
sions arise primarily because of the method used for

54
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
calculating the chemical constituents. Chemical
changes can be expressed in either percentages (or
some other expression of concentrations, for example,
ppm or mg/kg) or be based on the actual changes in
total amounts of the constituent (for example, pounds/
acre or kg/ha). Before fire, the percent of a given
chemical constituent is usually based on the amount
contained in a prefire sample that can contain vari-
able amounts of organic matter. In contrast, follow-
ing the fire the percent of the same chemical constitu-
ent is based on the weight of a burned sample that
contains varying amounts of ash along with charred
and unburned organic matter. Thus, the confusion in
nutrient changes arises because different bases are
used for calculating the change in a particular chemi-
cal constituent (that is, based on mainly organic
matter before combustion as compared to ashy and
unburned materials following a fire). This confusion
between percentages and total amounts was first
reported in a study on the effect of fire on N loss
during heating (Knight 1966). This study indicated
that the differences between percent N and total
amount of N started at 212 ∞F (100 ∞C) and became
greater until about 932 ∞F (500 ∞C). Because of these
difficulties in interpreting concentration and percent-
age data, the following discussion on the fire-related
changes in chemical constituents will first focus on
the more fundamental changes in chemical constitu-
ents in wildland ecosystems.
As a general rule, the total amounts of chemical
elements are never increased by fire. The total amounts
of different chemical elements on a particular burned
site most likely decrease, although in some cases may
remain the same (for example, elements with high
temperature thresholds such as Mg, Ca, and others
listed in table 3.1). The fire, however, does change the
form of different elements and in many cases makes
them more available for plants and other biological
organisms. A classic example of this is total N con-
tained in the ecosystem organic matter (table 3.2).
When organic matter is combusted, total N on the site
is always decreased, although increases in the avail-
able forms of N are likely to occur as is discussed in a
later section, “Nitrogen.” Therefore, managers must
be alert when interpreting the significance of the
sometimes contradictory changes in different nutri-
ents during a fire that are reported in the literature.
The following sections focus on describing these changes
in terms of the underlying chemical processes and to
indicate the management implications of these changes
in terms of soil and ecosystem productivity and postfire
management.

Organic Matter and Carbon
Many chemical properties and processes occurring
in soils depend upon the presence of organic matter.
Not only does it play a key role in the chemistry of the
soil, but it also affects the physical properties (see
chapter 2) and the biological properties (see chapter 4)
of soils as well. Soil organic matter is particularly
important for nutrient supply, cation exchange capac-
ity, and water retention. However, burning consumes
aboveground organic material (future soil organic
matter, including large logs), and soil heating can
consume soil organic matter (fig. 3.1). The purpose of
the following discussion is to focus as much as possible
on the purely chemical properties of organic matter
and on changes that occur as the result of soil heating.
Because organic C is one of the major constituents of
organic matter, the changes in organic matter and
organic C during soil heating are considered to be
similar for all practical purposes.
Location of Organic Matter in Different Eco-
systems—Organic compounds are found in both
aboveground and belowground biomass where they
make up the standing dead and live plants and dead
organic debris (that is, leaves, stems, twigs, and logs)
that accumulate on the soil surface and throughout
the soil profile (DeBano and others 1998). Organic
matter found in the soil consists of at least seven
components, namely:
•
The L-layer, (oi) which is made up of readily
identifiable plant materials.
•
The F-layer, (oe) which contains partially de-
composed organic matter but can still be iden-
tified as different plant parts (needles, leaves,
stems, twigs, bark, and so forth).
•
The H-layer, (oa) which is made up of com-
pletely decayed and disintegrated organic
materials, some of which is usually mixed
with the upper mineral soil layers.
•
Coarse woody debris that is eventually de-
cayed but can remain on the soil surface or
buried in the mineral soil for long periods.
•
Charcoal or other charred materials that be-
come mixed with the forest floor and upper-
most layers of the mineral soil.
•
The uppermost part of the A-horizon, which is
composed mainly of a mixture of humus and
mineral soil particles.
•
A mixture of mineral soil, plant roots, and
biomass (live and dead) that is concentrated
primarily in the A-horizon but may extend
downward into the B-horizon or deeper de-
pending upon the type of vegetation growing
on the site.
The amount of aboveground and belowground or-
ganic matter varies widely between different vegeta-
tion types depending upon on the temperature and
moisture conditions prevailing in a particular area
(DeBano and others 1998). In almost all ecosystems
throughout the world, greater quantities of C (a mea-
sure of organic matter) are found belowground than
aboveground (fig. 3.2). In grasslands, savannas, and
tundra-covered areas, much greater quantities of or-
ganic C are found in the underground plant parts than
aboveground (less than 10 percent of the total C in
these herbaceous vegetation ecosystems is found

aboveground). Tundra ecosystems are unique in that
large amounts of organic matter accumulate on the
soil surface because the low year-long temperatures
severely limit decomposition. In forest ecosystems, C
is more evenly distributed aboveground and
belowground (for example, temperate deciduous and
boreal forests). In general, soils with larger propor-
tions of organic matter in the aboveground biomass
and on their forest floors are more prone to distur-
bances (including fire) in their nutrient and C regimes
than those in which most of the C in the ecosystem is
located belowground.
Dynamics of Organic Matter Accumulation—
In forests, the dynamics of the forest floor are respon-
sible for the accumulation of organic matter, and the
forest floor provides a major storage reservoir for
nutrients that are cycled within natural ecosystems
(fig. 3.3). An aggrading forest ecosystem sequesters
nutrients and C aboveground in both the biomass and
the forest floor (Knoepp and Swank 1994). Over many
years this material forms the forest floor or the organic
soil horizons (designated as Oi, Oe, and Oa horizons in
part A, fig A.1). Depending on the soil type, organic
matter may be concentrated in the forest floor or
spread in decreasing amounts downward through the
soil profile (fig. 3.4 and A.2).
The forest floor increases during forest development
and aggradation when the rate of addition is greater
than the rate of decomposition. For example, Knoepp
and Swank (1994) found that forest floor mass

ments. (Adapted from Brown 1980.)

increased by 28 and 45 percent over a 10-year period
in an aggrading mixed oak (Quercus spp.) forest and
white pine (Pinus strobus) plantation, respectively.
In Arizona, Covington and Sackett (1992) examined
forest floor accumulation in a ponderosa pine (P.
ponderosa) stand having several different age “sub-
stands” within it and found several significant differ-
ences in forest floor mass among the substands. In
general, the younger sapling areas had the smallest
accumulations of forest floor materials compared to
old growth pine substands that had the greatest. Over
long periods the inputs and outputs of forest floor
materials, coarse woody debris, fine woody debris, and
leaf litter eventually reach a dynamic equilibrium
depending upon the stand type (for example, conifer-
ous versus hardwood) and forest management prac-
tices used (for example, uncut versus cut, log only
versus whole-tree harvest).
Coarse Woody Debris—Coarse woody debris (in-
cluding slash piles) is an important component of the
organic matter pools found in forested ecosystems
(fig. 3.5). In many cases it is partially or totally
covered by soil and humus layers, and it has been
found to comprise more than 50 percent of the total
surface organic matter (this can amount to 16.5 to
22.3 tons/acre or 37 to 50 Mg/ha) in old growth forests
in the Inland Northwest (Page-Dumroese and others
1991, Jurgensen and others 1997). Coarse woody
debris, along with smaller organic matter, enhances
the physical, chemical, and biological properties of
the soil and thereby contributes directly to site pro-
ductivity (Brooks and others 2003). It also provides a
favorable microenvironment for the establishment

of seedlings and plant growth. The microbiological
role of coarse woody debris is discussed further in
chapter 4.
Fire Effects—Fire not only affects the organic
matter by directly affecting its chemical composition
but it also indirectly affects the subsequent decompo-
sition rates. The magnitude of changes is related to the
severity of the burn (for example, low, moderate, or
high).
Chemical Changes: The low temperature threshold
of organic matter makes it especially sensitive to soil
heating during fire (table 3.1). Also, a major portion of
the organic matter is located in the uppermost part of
the soil profile (surface litter and humus layers) where
it is exposed directly to the heat radiated downward
during a fire (see part A). The changes in organic
matter during the course of heating have been of
interest to scientists for more than 60 years (Hosking
1938), and the changes reported by these earlier stud-
ies showed that:
•
Losses of organic matter can occur at tempera-
tures below 212 ∞F (100 ∞C).
•
Volatile constituents in organic matter are
lost at temperatures up to 392 ∞F (200 ∞C).
•
Destructive distillation destroys about 85 per-
cent of the soil organic matter at temperatures
between 392 and 572 ∞F (200 and 300 ∞C).
•
Above 572 ∞F (300 ∞C), the greater part of the
residual organic matter consists of carbon-
aceous material, which is finally lost upon
ignition.
•
Heating the soil to 842 ∞F (450 ∞C) for 2 hours,
or to 932 ∞F (500 ∞C) for 1/2 hour, destroys
about 99 percent of the organic matter.
Recent studies on the detailed heat-induced changes
in organic matter have improved our understanding of
the specific chemical changes that occur in organic
matter during the course of heating (DeBano and
others 1998). At low temperatures, the changes in
organic matter affect the more sensitive functional
groups; at higher temperatures the thermal decompo-
sition of nuclei occurs (Schnitzer and Hoffman 1964).
At lower temperatures between 482 and 752 ∞F (250
and 400 ∞C) both phenolic OH and carboxyl (COOH)
groups are lost, although phenolic groups are the more
stable of the two. Another study of the thermal changes
occurring in the H-layer under an evergreen oak forest
in Spain showed that oxygen-containing functional
groups found in humic and fulvic acids were altered
(Almendros and others 1990). Humic acids were
converted into alkali-insoluble substances that con-
tributed to soil humus, while fulvic acids were trans-
formed into acid-insoluble polymers. Biomass that
was not completely burned contained both alkali-
soluble lignin materials and brown products formed
by dehydration of carbohydrates. The lignin com-
pounds formed were more resistant to further chemi-
cal and biological change.
In a separate study, Ross and others (1997) found a
decrease in total soil C and potassium sulfate extract-
able C at 1.5 and 2.5 years after burning. Sands (1983)
found that 24 years after an intense site preparation
burn on sandy soils, soil C was still lower than on
adjacent unburned sites. This was generally the case
for all soil C components he examined, including total
organic C, extractable C, water-soluble C, humic ac-
ids, and carbohydrates.
Decomposition rates: In unburned ecosystems, natu-
ral decomposition processes (most biologically medi-
ated) slowly release nutrients to tree and plant roots

growing within the forest floor and to the mineral soil
below. These biological processes add organic matter
and nutrients to soils in forest environments under
moderate temperatures through the activity of insects
and microbes (DeBano 1991). Burning, however, acts
as an instantaneous physical decomposition process
that not only volatilizes nutrients, such as N, from the
site but also alters the remaining organic materials
(St. John and Rundel 1976).
Burning not only rapidly accelerates the rates of
organic matter decomposition during the fire itself
but can also indirectly affect postfire decomposition
rates. For example, Schoch and Binkley (1986) and
Raison and others (1990) studied loblolly pine (P. taeda)
and radiata pine (P. radiata) plantations following
fire. They found that decomposition rates of the re-
maining forest floor increased after burning, releasing
ammonium (NH4) and other nutrients. Observed
changes in nutrient release and availability may be
due to the alteration of organic matter solubility as a
result of soil heating during a fire. The change in
nutrient release and availability along with increased
soil temperature and moisture content may also in-
crease biological activity. This response may be short
lived, however, because this readily available organic
matter often diminishes rapidly and decomposition
rates decrease (Raison and others 1990). Conversely,
some studies have noted decreases in the rates of
organic matter decomposition following burning.
Monleon and Cromack (1996) measured decreased
rates of decomposition in ponderosa pine forests im-
mediately following burning and for up to 12 years.
They concluded that the lower decomposition rates
may be due to the combination of increased tempera-
ture and decreased moisture in the postfire forest
floor. Springett (1976) also measured slower decompo-
sition in Australian plantations and native forests
caused by the changes in soil temperature and mois-
ture as well as a decrease in the diversity and density
of soil fauna following burning. This suggested that
burning on a frequent rotation could simplify the litter
fauna and flora, but these changes may permanently
alter patterns of organic matter decomposition and
nutrient release.
Both fire severity and frequency of burning affect
the amount of organic matter that is lost as a result of
burning. These are two characteristics of fire effects
that fire management specialists can alter within the
context of a prescribed burning program.
Fire severity: The effect of severity of burning on the
amount of organic matter burned was reported for a
350 acre (142 ha) wildfire that burned a table moun-
tain pine stand in the Shenandoah Valley (Groeschl
and others 1990, 1992, 1993). This wildfire left a
mosaic pattern of areas that were burned at different
severities. They reported that on areas burned by a
low-severity fire, the forest floor Oi and Oe layers were
completely combusted, but the Oa layer remained.
High-severity burning also consumed the Oa layer. Of
the 10.1 tons/acre (22.6 Mg/ha) of C present in the
forest floor in the unburned areas, no C remained in
the high-severity burned areas compared to 9.3 tons/
acre (20.8 Mg/ha) C that was left on the burned areas
at low severities.
The effect of prescribed burning on the C and N
content of the forest floor on an area supporting a
mixed pine-oak overstory with a ericaceous shrub
layer was studied in the Southern Appalachian Moun-
tains (Vose and Swank 1993, Clinton and others 1996).
The study areas were treated with felling-and-burn-
ing of existing trees to stimulate pine regeneration.
Carbon and N content of the forest floor in these
systems was examined after felling, prior to burning,
and it was found that the forest floor contained be-
tween 15 and 22 percent of the total aboveground C on
the site and 44 to 55 percent of the total aboveground
N. Prescribed burning of these sites consumed the
entire Oi layer, but 75 to 116 percent of the total forest
floor C and 65 to 97 percent of the N remained in the
combined Oe and Oa layers. On these sites, about half
of the total aboveground N pool was contained in the
forest floor. Total aboveground N losses ranged from
0.086 tons/acre (0.193 Mg/ha) for the lowest severity
fire to 0.214 tons/acre (0.480 Mg/ha) on the most
severe burn. Under prescribed burning conditions it is
frequently possible to select appropriate weather con-
ditions prior to burning (for example, time since last
rain, humidity, temperature) to minimize the effects
of fire on the consumption of organic matter. There-
fore, it has been recommended that weather condi-
tions prior to burning (for example, time since rainfall)
could be used as a predictor of forest floor consumption
(Fyles and others 1991).
Responses of total C and N are variable and depend
on site conditions and fire characteristics. For ex-
ample, Grove and others (1986) found no change in
organic C in the surface 0 to 1.2 inch (0-3 cm) of soil
immediately following burning; percent total N, how-
ever, increased. Knoepp and Swank (1993a,b) found
no consistent response in total N in the upper soil
layer, but did find increases in NH4 concentrations
and N mineralization on areas where a burning treat-
ment followed felling.
Fire frequency: As would be expected, frequency of
burning can affect C accumulations. A study was
carried out on tropical savanna sites in Africa having
both clay and sandy soils that were burned repeatedly
every 1, 3, or 5 years (Bird and others 2000). While
sites with clay soils had greater total C than did the
sandy soils, they responded similarly to burning. All
unburned sites had 40 to 50 percent greater C than
burned sites. Low frequency burning (every 5 years)

USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
59
resulted in an increase in soil C of about 10 percent
compared to the mean of all burned areas. High fre-
quency burning (every year) decreased C about 10
percent. In another study, Wells and others (1979)
reported the results of a 20-year burning study in a
pine plantation in South Carolina. They found that
periodic burning over 20-year period removed 27 per-
cent of the forest floor. Annual burning conducted in
the summer removed 29 percent of the forest floor as
compared to a 54 percent loss resulting from winter
burning. The total organic matter content of the sur-
face soil (0 to 2 inches or 0 to 5 cm) increased in all
cases, but there was no effect on the 2 to 3.9 inches (5-
10 cm) soil layer. Interestingly, when they summed
the organic matter in the forest floor and in the surface
0 to 3.9 inches (0-10 cm) of soil they found that these
low-severity periodic burns sites had not reduced but
only redistributed the organic matter.
The incidence of fire has been found to also affect the
organic matter composition of savannahlike vegetation
(referred to as “cerrado”) in central Brazil (Roscoe and
others 2000). On plots exposed to more frequent fires
(burned 10 times in 21 years) C and N were decreased
in the litter by 1.652 and 0.046 tons/acre (3.703 and
0.104 Mg/ha), respectively, although no significant dif-
ferences were noted in the upper 3 feet (1 meter) of the
underlying soil. Interestingly, the increase in fire inci-
dence replaced the C3-C with C4-C by about 35 percent
throughout the soil profile. This suggested that a more
rapid rate of soil organic matter turnover occurred in
areas burned by frequent fires, and as a result the soil
would not be able to replace sufficient C to maintain
long-term productivity of the site.
Prescribed fire was returned into overstocked pon-
derosa pine stands on the Mogollon Rim of Arizona
for the purpose of restoring fire into the ecosystem
and removing fuel buildups (Neary and others 2003).
Prescribed fires were ignited at intervals of 1, 2, 4, 6,
8, and 10 years to determine the best fire return
interval for Southwest ponderosa pine ecosystems
(Sackett 1980, Sackett and others 1996). Two sites
were treated—one on volcanic-derived soils and the
other on sedimentary-derived soils near Flagstaff,
AZ. Soil total C and total N levels were highly vari-
able and exhibited an increasing, but inconsistent,
concentration trend related to burn interval. They
ranged from 2.9 to more than 6.0 percent total C and
0.19 to 0.40 percent total N (fig. 3.6). High spatial
variability was measured within treatments, prob-
ably due to microsite differences (location of samples
in the open, under large old-growth trees, in small-
diameter thickets, in pole-sized stands, next to downed
logs, and so forth). Stratification of samples by
microsite differences could possibly reduce the within-
plot variability but add complexity to any sampling
design. Although there were statistically significant
differences between the total C levels in soils of the
unburned plots and the 8-year burning interval,
there were no differences between burning intervals.
There also was a statistically significant difference
between unburned and 2-year burning interval and
the 8-year burning interval in total soil N. This study
determined that burning increased mineral soil C
and N, which conflicted with Wright and Hart’s
(1997) contention that the 2-year burning interval
could deplete soil N and C pools. This study did not
examine the mineral fractions of the soil N pool,
NH4-N, and NO3-N. Although the mineral forms of
N are small (less than 2 percent of the total soil N
pool), they are important for plant nutrition and
microorganism population functions
Soil organic matter: Summary reports have de-
scribed the effect of different management activities
(including the effect of fire) on the organic matter and
N found in the mineral portion of forest soils (D.W.
Johnson 1992, Johnson and Curtis 2001). A
metaanalysis on the results of 13 studies completed
between 1975 and 1997 (table 3.3) show that the C and
N contents of both the A-horizon and the underlying
mineral soil layers change only a small amount (less
than 10 percent) in the long term (fig. 3.7 and 3.8).
These results agreed with the conclusions of another
review (E. A. Johnson 1992) that indicated the overall
effect of fire was not significant, although there was a
significant effect of time since fire. It must be remem-
bered, however, that although small changes in soil
organic matter and C occurred in the soils during these
studies, that substantial amounts of both organic
litter and duff were most likely consumed during these
fires. Organic matter and N losses from the forest floor
could have a lasting effect on the long-term productiv-
ity and sustainability of forest sites, particularly when
they occur on nutrient-deficient sites (see the later
discussions in this chapter on N loss and ecosystem
productivity).
Cation Exchange Capacity
Cation exchange is the interchange between cations
in solution and different cations adsorbed on the
surface of any negatively charged materials such as a
clay or organic colloids (humus). Cation exchange
capacity is the sum of the exchangeable cations found
on organic and inorganic soil colloids (fig. 3.9). It arises
from the negatively charged particles found on clay
particles and colloidal organic matter in the soil.
Cation exchange capacity sites are important storage
places for soluble cations found in the soil. The adsorp-
tion of cations prevents the loss of these cations from
the soils by leaching following fire. Although most of
the exchange sites in soils are negative and attract
cations, there are some positively charged sites that
can attract anions (anion exchange has been reported
to occur on clay particles).

60
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
The relative contribution of clay particles and or-
ganic matter to the cation exchange capacity of the soil
depends largely upon the proportion of the two compo-
nents and the total quantities of each present (Tate
1987). Cation exchange capacity also depends upon
the type of clay and organic matter present. Clay
materials such as montmorillonites have large ex-
change capacities, and other clays such as kaolinite
are much lower. Other mineral particles such as silt
and sand contain few adsorption sites for cations. In
organic matter, the degree of humification affects the
cation exchange capacity, and the more extensive the
decomposition of organic material, the greater the
exchange capacity.
Soil heating during a fire can affect cation exchange
capacity in at least two ways. The most common
change is the destruction of humus compounds. The
location of the humus layer at, or near, the soil surface

makes it especially vulnerable to partial or total de-
struction during a fire because organic and humic
materials start decomposing at about 212 ∞F (100 ∞C)
and are almost completely destroyed at 932 ∞F (500
∞C). These temperatures are easily reached during
brushland and forest fires (see chapter 2 discussion on
soil temperatures). In contrast, the cation exchange
capacity of the clay materials is more resistant to
change because heating and temperatures of 752 ∞F
(400 ∞C) must be reached before dehydration occurs.
The complete destruction of clay materials does not
occur until temperatures of 1,292 to 1,472 ∞F (700 to
800 ∞C) are reached. In addition, clay material is
seldom located on the soil surface but instead is lo-
cated at least several centimeters below the soil sur-
face in the B-horizon where it is well protected from

surface heating. In general, the reduction in exchange
capacity as the result of a fire is proportional to the
amount of the total cation capacity that is provided by
the organic component (DeBano and others 1998). The
amount of cation exchange capacity remaining after a
fire affects the leaching losses of soluble nutrients
released during the fire. For example, the prefire
cation exchange capacity of sandy soils may consist
mainly of exchange sites found on the humus portion
of the soil. If large amounts of humus are destroyed in
these sandy soils during burning, then no mechanisms
are available to prevent large losses of soluble nutri-
ents by leaching.
The loss of cation exchange capacity, as the result of
organic matter destroyed by fire, has been reported on
by several authors. Soto and Diaz-Fierros (1993) in-
tensively monitored changes in soil cation exchange
capacity for one of the six soils they exposed to increas-
ing temperatures. They found that cation exchange
capacity decreased from 28.4 meq/100 g (28.4 cmol/kg)
at 77 ∞F (25 ∞C) down to 1 meq/100 g (1 cmol/kg) when
exposed to 1,292 ∞F (700 ∞C). The largest decrease
occurred between 338 and 716 ∞F (170 and 380 ∞C),
dropping from 28.1 to 6.9 meq/100 g (28.1 to 6.9 cmol/
kg). Sands (1983) examined two adjacent radiata pine
sites on sandy soils in Southeastern Australia 24 years
after cutting. He found that the sites that received an
intense site preparation burning before planting had
decreased cation exchange capacity downward in soils
to 20 cm compared to no changes on unburned natu-
rally regenerated sites.

chians that resulted in a mosaic burn pattern similar

vided by both organic matter (humus) found in the

to a wildfire produced a slight but significant decrease
in cation exchange capacity 3 months after burning
(Vose and others 1999). Also associated with the change
in cation exchange capacity on midslope areas (me-
dium-severity burn) was a decrease in exchangeable K
and Mg, along with an increase in soil pH.
Cations
Cations found in the soil that are affected by fire
include Ca, Mg, Na, K, and ammonia (NH4
 ), although
these cations are not usually deficient in most wild-
land soils (DeBano 1991). In many studies, a signifi-
cant increase in soil cation concentration following
either prescribed burning or a wildfire has been re-
ported (Grove and others 1986, Raison and others
1990, Soto and Diaz-Fierros 1993). The NH4 cation,
which is an important component of N cycling and soil
productivity, responds differently from the other cat-
ions. With the exception of NH4, cations have high
temperature thresholds and, as a result, are not easily
volatilized and lost from burned areas. The ash depos-
ited on the soil surface during a fire contains high
concentrations of cations, and their availability is
increased, including NH4 (Marion and others 1991,
DeBano and others 1998; fig. 1.4). The amount of NH4
released by burning depends upon fuel loading and the
quantity of fuel combusted (Tomkins and others 1991).
Some of the cations can be lost through particulate
transfer in the smoke (Clayton 1976).
Monovalent cations, such as Na and K, are present
largely as chlorides and carbonates that are readily
mobilized (Soto and Diaz-Fierros 1993). Divalent ions,
such as Ca and Mg, are less mobile and are commonly
present as oxides and carbonates. The formation of
insoluble calcium carbonate can occur, which limits
the availability of P following fire. Although these
readily available monovalent and divalent cations
probably do not materially affect plant growth di-
rectly, their amount and composition determines base
saturation, which plays an important role in control-
ling the pH regimes in soils (DeBano and others 1998).
Soil pH and Buffer Capacity
Soil pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion activity in
the soil and is determined at specified moisture con-
tents. Neutral soils have a pH of 7, acidic soils have a
pH less than 7, and basic soils are those with a pH
greater than 7. Buffer capacity is the ability of ions
associated with the solid phase to buffer changes in ion
concentration of the soil solution.
The combustion of organic matter during a fire and
the subsequent release of soluble cations tend to in-
crease pH slightly because basic cations are released
during combustion and deposited on the soil surface.
The increase in soil pH, however, is usually temporary

depending upon the original soil pH, amount of ash
released, chemical composition of the ash, and wetness
of the climate (Wells and others 1979). The ash-bed
effect discussed later in this chapter is an example of
these factors in which large amounts of nutrients are
deposited, with pH values being measurably changed
by fire.
The pH of the soil is an important factor affecting the
availability of plant nutrients (fig. 3.10). The nutri-
ents released during a fire that are most likely to be
affected are P, iron, and copper. P is particularly
important because it is a macronutrient that is fre-
quently limiting in wildland ecosystems, and it can
also become insoluble at both high or low pHs (see part
A). At low pH, P forms insoluble compounds with iron
and at high pH, Ca compounds tend to immobilize it.
Nitrogen
Nitrogen is considered the most limiting nutrient in
wildland ecosystems and as such it requires special
consideration when managing fire, particularly in N-
deficient ecosystems (Maars and others 1983). Nitro-
gen is unique because it is the only soil nutrient that
is not supplied to the soil by chemical weathering of
parent rock material. Almost all N found in the vegeta-
tion, water, and soil of wildland systems has to be
added to the system from the atmosphere. A rare
exception is the addition of some synthetic N-fertiliz-
ers that have been produced industrially and used for
fertilizing forested areas. The cycling of N involves a
series of interrelated complex chemical and biological
processes (also see chapter 4). Only those cycling
processes affecting chemical changes in N are dis-
cussed in this chapter (that is, N volatilization). Bio-
logically mediated processes affecting N are discussed
in more detail as part of chapter 4. The changes in N
availability produced during fire are discussed later in
this chapter in a section describing the effect of fire on
nutrient availability
Responses to Soil Heating—Volatilization is the
chemically driven process most responsible for N losses
during fire. There is a gradual increase in N loss by
volatilization as temperature increases (Knight 1966,
White and others 1973). The amount of loss at differ-
ent temperatures has established the following se-
quence of N losses upon heating:
•
Complete loss (100 percent) of N occurs at
temperatures above 932 ∞F (500 ∞C).
•
Between 75 and 100 percent of the N is lost at
temperatures of 752 to 932 ∞F (400 to 500 ∞C).
•
Between 50 and 75 percent of the N is lost at
temperatures of 572 to 752 ∞F (300 to 400 ∞C).
•
Between 25 and 50 percent of the N is lost at
temperatures of 392 to 572 ∞F (200 to 300 ∞C).
•
No N losses occur at temperatures below
392 ∞F (200 ∞C).
As a general rule the amount of total N that is
volatilized during combustion is directly proportional
to the amount of organic matter destroyed (Raison and
others 1985a). It has been estimated that almost 99
percent of the volatilized N is converted to N2 gas
(DeBell and Ralston 1970). At lower temperatures, N2
can be produced during organic matter decomposi-
tion without the volatilization of N compounds (Grier
1975). The N that is not completely volatilized either
remains as part of the unburned fuels or it is converted
to highly available NH4-N that remains in the soil
(DeBano and others 1979, Covington and Sackett
1986, Kutiel and Naveh 1987, DeBano 1991).
Estimates of the total N losses during prescribed fire
must be based on both fire behavior and total fuel
consumption because irregular burning patterns are
common. As a result, combustion is not complete at all
locations on the landscape (DeBano and others 1998).
For example, during a prescribed burn in southern
California, total N loss only amounted to 10 percent of
the total N contained in the plant, litter, and upper soil
layers before burning (DeBano and Conrad 1978). The
greatest loss of N occurred in aboveground fuels and
litter on the soil surface. In another study of N loss
during a prescribed fire over dry and moist soils,
about two-thirds of the total N was lost during burns
over dry soils compared to only 25 percent when the
litter and soil were moist (DeBano and others 1979).
Although these losses were relatively small, it should
be remembered that even small losses can adversely

affect the long-term productivity of N- deficient ecosys-
tems. The importance of N losses from ecosystems hav-
ing different pools of N is considered in more detail below.
Monleon and others (1997) conducted understory
burns on ponderosa pine sites burned 4 months, 5 years,
and 12 years previously. The surface soils, 0 to 2 inches
(0 to 5 cm), showed the only significant response. The
4-month sites had increased total C and inorganic N
following burning and an increased C/N ratio. Burn-
ing the 5-year-old sites resulted in a decrease in total
soil C and N and a decrease in the C/N ratio. Total soil
C and N in the surface soils did not respond to burning
on the 12-year-old site.
Nitrogen Losses—An Enigma— It has been conclu-
sively established by numerous studies that total N is
decreased as a result of combustion (DeBano and
others 1998). The amount of N lost is generally propor-
tional to the amount of organic matter combusted
during the fire. The temperatures at which N is lost
are discussed above. In contrast, available N is usually
increased as a result of fire, particularly NH4-N
(Christensen 1973, DeBano and others 1979, Carballas
and others 1993). This increased N availability en-
hances postfire plant growth, and gives the impres-
sion that more total N is present after fire. This
increase in fertility, however, is misleading and can be
short-lived. Any temporary increase in available N
following fire is usually quickly utilized by plants
within the first few years after burning.
Nitrogen Losses and Ecosystem Productivity—
The consequences of N losses during fire on ecosystem
productivity depend on the proportion of total N lost
for a given ecosystem (Barnett 1989, DeBano and
others 1998). In N-limited ecosystems even small
losses of N by volatilization can impact long-term
productivity (fig. 3.11).
The changes in site productivity are related to the
proportion of total N in the system that is lost. For
example, the left portion of figure 3.11 represents a
situation where large quantities of N are presented on
a site having high productivity. Moving to the right
side of the graph, both total N capital and productivity
decrease. This decrease is not linear because there are
likely to be greater losses in productivity per unit loss
of N capital on sites having lower productivity (right
side of fig. 3.11) than on sites having higher site
productivity (left side of fig. 3.11). As a result, the
losses in site productivity per unit N loss (ah to bh) from
sites of high productivity (lh) are less than losses in site
productivity per unit N loss (ai to bi) from sites having
low productivity (li). This relationship points to the
importance of somehow replenishing N lost during a
fire on low productivity sites or when using prescribed
fire in these situations, taking special care not to
consume large amounts of the organic matter present.
Phosphorus
Phosphorus is probably the second most limited
nutrient found in natural ecosystems. Deficiencies of
P have been reported in P-fixing soils (Vlamis and
others 1955) and as a result from N fertilization
applications (Heilman and Gessel 1963). Phosphorus
uptake and availability to plants is complicated by the
relationship between mycorrhizae and organic matter
and in most cases does not involve a simple absorption
from the soil solution (Trappe and Bollen 1979). Phos-
phorus is lost at a higher temperature during soil
heating than N, and only about 60 percent of the total
P is lost by nonparticulate transfer when organic
matter is totally combusted (Raison and others 1985a).
The combustion of organic matter leaves a relatively
large amount of highly available P in the surface ash
found on the soil surface immediately following fire
(see discussion on nutrient availability later in this
chapter; also fig. 1.4). This highly available P, how-
ever, can be quickly immobilized if calcareous sub-
stances are present in the ash and thus can become
unavailable for plant growth.
Sulfur
The role of S in ecosystem productivity is not well
understood although its fluctuation in the soil is gen-
erally parallel to that of inorganic N (DeBano and
others 1998). Sulfur has been reported as limiting in
some coastal forest soils of the Pacific Northwest,
particularly after forest stands have been fertilized
with N (Barnett 1989). The loss of S by volatilization
occurs at temperatures intermediate to that of N and
P (Tiedemann 1987), and losses of 20 to 40 percent of
the S in aboveground biomass have been reported
during fires (Barnett 1989). Sulfur is similar to P (and
unlike N) in that it cannot be fixed by biological
processes, but instead is added primarily by burning

different levels of site productivity. (After Barnett 1989).

fossil fuels (a source of acid rain), as fallout from
volcanic eruptions, or by the weathering of rocks
during soil development (DeBano and others 1998).
Soil Chemical Processes _________
Nutrient Cycling
Nutrients undergo a series of changes and transfor-
mations as they are cycled through wildland ecosys-
tems. The sustained productivity of natural ecosys-
tems depends on a regular and consistent cycling of
nutrients that are essential for plant growth (DeBano
and others 1998). Nutrient cycling in nonfire environ-
ments involves a number of complex pathways and
includes both chemical and biological processes (fig.
3.3). Nutrients are added to the soil by precipitation,
dry fall, N- fixation, and the geochemical weathering
of rocks. Nutrients found in the soil organic matter are
transformed by decomposition and mineralization into
forms that are available to plants (see chapter 4). In
nonfire environments, nutrient availability is regu-
lated biologically by decomposition processes. As a
result, the rate of decomposition varies widely depend-
ing on moisture, temperature, and type of organic
matter. The decomposition process is sustained by
litter fall (that is, leaf, wood, and other debris that falls
to the forest floor). Through the process of decomposi-
tion, this material breaks down, releases nutrients,
and moves into the soil as soil organic matter. Forest
and other wildland soils, unlike agricultural soils
where nutrients from external sources are applied as
needed, rely on this internal cycling of nutrients to
maintain plant growth (Perala and Alban 1982). As a
result, nutrient losses from unburned ecosystems are
usually low, although some losses can occur by volatil-
ization, erosion, leaching, and denitrification. This
pattern of tightly controlled nutrient cycling mini-
mizes the loss of nutrients from these wildland sys-
tems in the absence of any major disturbance such as
fire.
Fire, however, alters the nutrient cycling processes
in wildland systems and dramatically replaces long-
term biological decomposition rates with that of in-
stantaneous thermal decomposition that occurs dur-
ing the combustion of organic fuels (St John and
Rundel 1976). The magnitude of these fire-related
changes depends largely on fire severity (DeBano and
others 1998). For example, high severity fires occur-
ring during slash burning not only volatilize nutrients
both in vegetation and from surface organic soil hori-
zons, but heat is transferred into the soil, which
further affects natural biological processes such as
decomposition and mineralization (fig. 3.12; see also
chapter 4). The effects of fire on soil have both short-
and long-term consequences (that is, direct and indi-
rect effects) on soil and site productivity because of the
changes that occur in both the quantity and quality of
organic matter.
In summary, many nutrients essential for plant
growth including N, P, S, and some cations described
earlier are all affected to some extent by fire. Nitrogen
is likely the most limiting nutrient in natural systems
(Maars and others 1983), followed by P and S. Cations
released by burning may affect soil pH and result in
the immobilization of P. The role of micronutrients in
ecosystem productivity and their relationship to soil
heating during fire is for the most part unclear. One
study, however, did show that over half of the sele-
nium in burned laboratory samples was recovered in
the ash residue (King and others 1977).
Nutrient Loss Mechanisms
Nutrient losses during and following fire mainly
involve chemical processes. The disposition of nutri-
ents contained in plant biomass and soil organic mat-
ter during and following a fire generally occurs in one
of the following ways:
•
Direct gaseous volatilization into the atmo-
sphere takes place during fire. Nitrogen can be
transformed into N2 along with other nitrog-
enous gases (DeBell and Ralston 1970).
•
Particulates are lost in smoke. Phosphorus
and cations are frequently lost into the atmo-
sphere as particulate matter during combus-
tion (Clayton 1976, Raison and others 1985a,b).
•
Nutrients remain in the ash deposited on the
soil surface. These highly available nutrients
are vulnerable to postfire leaching into and
through the soil, or they can also be lost during
wind erosion (Christensen 1973, Grier 1975,
Kauffman and others 1993).

•
Substantial losses of nutrients deposited in the
surface ash layer can occur during surface
runoff and erosion. These losses are amplified
by the creation of a water-repellent layer dur-
ing the fire (see chapter 2; DeBano and Conrad
1976, and Raison and others 1993).
•
Some of the nutrients remain in a stable condi-
tion. Nutrients can remain onsite as part of
the incompletely combusted postfire vegeta-
tion and detritus (Boerner 1982).
Although the direct soil heating effect is probably
limited to the surface (1 inch or 2.5 cm), the burning
effect can be measured to a greater depth due to the
leaching or movement of the highly mobile nutrients
out of the surface layers. For example, leaching losses
from the forest floor of a Southern pine forest under-
story burn increased from 2.3 times that of unburned
litter for monovalent cations Na and K to 10 to 20 times
for divalent cations Mg and Ca (Lewis 1974). Raison
and others (1990) noted that while K, Na, and Mg are
relatively soluble and can leach into and possibly
through the soil, Ca is most likely retained on the
cation exchange sites. Soil Ca levels may show a
response in the surface soils for many years following
burning. However, some cations more readily leached
and as a result are easily lost from the site. For
example, Prevost (1994) found that burning Kalmia
spp. litter in the greenhouse increased the leaching of
Mg but none of the other cations. Although ash and
forest floor cations were released due to burning, there
was no change in surface soil cation concentrations
(0-2 inches or 0-5 cm). Soto and Diaz-Fierros (1993)
measured changes in the pattern of cation leaching at
differing temperatures for the six soils that repre-
sented six different parent materials. Leaching pat-
terns were similar for all soil types. Leaching of diva-
lent cations, Ca, and Mg, increased as the temperatures
reached during heating increased, with a peak at
860 ∞F (460 ∞C). Monovalent cations, K, and Na,
differed in that initially leaching decreased as tem-
perature increased, reaching a minimum at 716 ∞F
(380 ∞C). Then, leaching increased up to 1,292 ∞F
(700 ∞C). The nutrients leached from the forest floor
and the ash were adsorbed in the mineral soil. Surface
soils were found to retain 89 to 98 percent of the
nutrients leached from the plant ash (Soto and Diaz-
Fierros 1993). As the leachates moved through the
mineral soil, the pH of the solution decreased.
Nutrient Availability
The increased nutrient availability following fire
results from the addition of ash, forest floor leachates,
and soil organic matter oxidation products as the result
of fire. The instantaneous combustion of organic matter
described earlier directly changes the availability of
all nutrients from that of being stored and slowly
becoming available during the decomposition of the
forest floor organic matter to that of being highly
available as an inorganic form present in the ash layer
after fire. Both short- and long-term availability of
nutrients are affected by fire.
Extractable Ions—Chemical ions generally be-
come more available in the surface soil as a result of
fire. Grove and others (1986) found that immediately
after fire, extractable nutrients increased in the 0 to
1.2 inch (0-3 cm) depth. Concentrations of S, NH4, P, K,
Na, zinc (Zn), Ca, and Mg increased. Everything ex-
cept Zn and organic C increased in terms of total
nutrients. At the lower depths sampled, 1.2 to 3.9
inches and 3.9 to 7.9 inches (3-10 and 10-20 cm), only
extractable P and K were increased by burning. One
year later nutrient levels were still greater than
preburn concentrations, but had decreased. A study
on an area of pine forest burned by a wildfire reported
that in the soil, concentrations of P, Ca, and Mg,
aluminum (Al), iron (Fe) had increased in response to
different levels of fire severity (Groeschl and others
1993). In the areas exposed to a high-severity fire, C
and N were significantly lower and soil pH was greater.
In another study the soil and plant composition changes
were studied in a jack pine (P. banksiana) stand
whose understory had been burned 10 years earlier
(Lynham and others 1998). In this study the soil pH
increased in all soil layers following burn—O horizon,
0-2 inches (0-5 cm), and 2-3.9 inches (5-10 cm)—and
remained 0.5 units greater than preburn 10 years
later in the O horizon. Phosphorus, K, Ca, and Mg all
increased in the mineral soil; P and K were still greater
than preburn levels 10 years later. A stand replace-
ment fire in the Southern Appalachians that resulted
in a mosaic burn pattern affected exchangeable ions
(Vose and others 1999). The midslope areas of this fire
burned at a moderate severity, and a decrease in
exchangeable K and Mg along with an increase in soil
pH was measured. Soil Ca, total C and N did not
respond in any of the burned areas. There are other
studies that have also shown no effect or decreases of
soil nutrients following burning (Sands 1983, Carreira
and Niell 1992, Vose and others 1999).
Nitrogen—The two most abundant forms of avail-
able N in the soil are available NH4- and N03-N. Both
forms are affected by fire. Burning rapidly oxidizes the
soil organic matter and volatilizes the organic N con-
tained in the forest floor and soil organic matter,
thereby releasing NH4-N (Christensen 1973, Jurgensen
and others 1981, Kovacic and others 1986, Kutiel and
Naveh 1987, Marion and others 1991, Knoepp and
Swank 1993a,b). The release of NH4-N has been found
by more detailed chemical analysis to involve the
thermal decomposition of proteins and other nitrogen-
rich organic matter. Specifically, the production of

NH4-N is related to the decomposition of secondary
amide groups and amino acids. These secondary amide
groups are particularly sensitive to decomposition
during heating and decompose when heated above 212
∞F (100 ∞C) to yield NH4-N (Russell and others 1974).
The volatilization of more heat-resistant N com-
pounds can occur up to 752 ∞F (400 ∞C). The tempera-
tures required to volatilize nitrogen compounds are
increased by the presence of clay particles in the soil
(Juste and Dureau 1967).
Most NH4-N that is volatilized is lost into the atmo-
sphere, but significant amounts can move downward
and condense in the mineral soil as exchange N. The
ash produced by the fire can also contain substantial
amounts of NH4-N. As a result of these two processes,
the inorganic N in the soil increases during fire (Kovacic
and others 1986, Raison and others 1990, Knoepp and
Swank 1993a,b). In contrast, N03-N is usually low
immediately following fire and increases rapidly dur-
ing the nitrification of NH4 (see chapter 4). These
N03-N concentrations may remain elevated for sev-
eral years following fire (fig. 3.13).
The production of N03-and NH4-N by fire depends on
several factors. These include fire severity, forest type,
and the use of fire in combination with other
postharvesting activities.
Effect of fire severity: The amounts of NH4-N that
are produced as a result of fire generally increase
with the severity and duration of the fire and the
associated soil heating (fig. 3.13, 3.14, 3.15). Al-
though large amounts of the total N in the
aboveground fuels, litter, duff, and upper soil layers
are lost into the atmosphere by volatilization, highly
available NH4-N still remains in the ash or in the
upper mineral soil layers following fire (fig. 3.13).
During both high and low severity fires, increase
occurs in the amounts of NH4-N that can be found
both in the ash remaining on the soil surface follow-
ing fire and in the upper mineral soil layers (Groeschl
and others 1990, Covington and Sackett 1992). The

concentrations of NH4-N found in the ash depend on
the severity of the fire and amount of forest floor
consumed, which in turn reflects stand age. During
low severity fires, less of the forest floor is consumed
and correspondingly less amounts of NH4-N are pro-
duced (fig. 3.15). The amounts of NH4-N produced
during a fire may vary from increases of less than 10
ppm (10mg/kg) during low severity fires to 16 and 43
ppm (16 mg/kg and 43 mg/kg) during medium and
high severity fires, respectively. The variability in
the amounts of NH4-N produced also increases with
fire severity. The NH4-N concentrations following
burning are short lived (fig. 3.13), although Covington
and Sackett (1992) reported that NH4-N levels re-
mained elevated for at least 1 year following a pre-
scribed burn in ponderosa pine stands in northern
Arizona.
The direct effects of fire on N03-N concentrations are
less predictable. For example, the results of a study in
the Shenandoah National Park showed that although
total extractable inorganic N was elevated for 1 year
following the fire, the N03-N on areas burned by either
high or low severity fires increased only slightly
(Groeschl and others 1990). A more common scenario
for N03-N changes following fire results from the
increased nitrification of the highly available N pro-
duced directly during the fire (for example, NH4-N).
The end result being that NH4-N produced directly
during fire is rapidly nitrified, and N03-N begins to
increase following fire, depending on temperature and
moisture conditions (fig. 3.13)
The effects of these increased levels of highly avail-
able N during and following fire are often beneficial to
the recovering plants by providing a temporary in-
crease in site fertility. However, these short-term
benefits must be carefully weighed against the overall
and long-term effect that the loss of total N during a
fire has on the sustained productivity of the site (see
the previous discussion on Nitrogen Losses –An
Enigma).
Effect of forest type: Forest type can also affect the
amount of NH4-N produced by fire. This occurs mainly
as a result of nature of the fire behavior and the
amounts of litter that accumulate under different
forest types. Such was the case in a study conducted in
Idaho on pine/hemlock sites compared to sites occu-
pied by a Douglas-fir/western larch forest (Mroz and
others 1980). In this study the NH4-N did not increase
following burning of the pine/hemlock forest in con-
trast to the Douglas-fir/western larch forest site where
it did increase. Within 3 to 7 days, however, mineral-
ization and/or nitrification had begun on most sites.
Frequency of burning: Repeated burning and its
frequency are often-asked questions by fire managers
when conducting prescribed burns. In terms of N
availability, the effects of burning frequency depends
largely upon the ecosystem, its inherent fertility (in
terms of total and available N), total amounts of
organic matter destroyed, and its ability to replenish
the N lost by volatilization (DeBano and others 1998).
Several studies have focused on the effect of differ-
ent frequencies of prescribed burning on changes in
total and concentrations of total and available nitro-
gen. For example, a study on the effect of repeated
burn low-intensity burning in Australian eucalypt
forests (Eucalyptus spp.)showed that fire-free periods
of about 10 or more years were required to allow
natural processes time to replace the amount of N lost
during the burning, assuming that about 50 percent of
the total N in the fuel was volatilized (Raison and
others 1993). In contrast, a study of repeated burning
at 1-, 2-, and 5-year intervals in ponderosa pine forests
in northern Arizona showed no significant differences
in total N among the different burning frequencies,
but available N (NH4- and N03-N) was higher on the
sites that repeatedly burned in comparison to the
unburned controls (Covington and Sackett 1986). Re-
searchers concluded from this Arizona study that
frequent periodic burning can be used to enhance N
availability in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests.
Studies on the effects of burning frequency on grass-
lands and shrubs have been reported to have less
desirable outcomes. For example, the annual burning
of tall grass prairies in the Great Plains of the Central
United States resulted in greater inputs of lower
quality plant residues, causing a significant reduction
in soil organic N, lower microbial biomass, lower N
availability, and higher C:N rations in soil organic
matter (Ojima and others 1994). Likewise, increases
in available N may have adverse effects on some
nutrient-deficient shrub ecosystems as has been re-
ported by a study in a shrubland (fynbos) in South
Africa. In a study of lowland fynbos, a twofold increase
in soil nutrient concentrations produced by fire were
detrimental to the survival of indigenous species that
had evolved on these nutrient-impoverished land-
scapes (Musil and Midgley 1990).
Phosphorus—Responses of available soil P to burn-
ing are variable and more difficult to predict than
those of other nutrients (Raison and others 1990).
Phosphorus volatilizes at temperatures of about
1,418 ∞F (770 ∞C). The fate of this volatilized P is not
well understood. One study indicated that the only
response was on the surface soil, and P did not appear
to move downward in the soil via volatilization and
condensation, as N does (DeBano 1991). Grove and
others (1986) found the opposite. They measured re-
sponses in all major cations, S, NH4, and Zn following
burning in the surface 0 to 1.2 inches (0-3 cm) of soil.
In their study, only P and K concentrations also

USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
69
responded in the lower soil depths (1.2-3.9 inches and
3.9-7.9 inches; 3-10 cm and 10-20 cm).
As in the case of N, fire severity affects changes in
extractable P. During high-severity fires, 50 to 60
percent of the total fuel P might be lost to volatilization
(Raison and others 1990, DeBano 1991). Part of this
volatilized P ends up as increased available P in both
the soil and ash following burning. An extensive study
of P responses to different burning severities was
reported for eucalypt forests (Romanya and others
1994). The study sites included unburned, burned,
and in an ash bed found under a burned slash pile. The
greatest effects occurred in the surface soil (0-1 inch;
0-2.5 cm), and the response was dependent on fire
severity. Extractable P concentrations increased with
increasing fire severity, but the response decreased
with depth. Organic P on the other hand reacted
oppositely; concentrations were lower in the inten-
sively burned areas and greater in the unburned and
low-severity burned sites.
Fire affects the enzymatic activity and mineraliza-
tion of P. One study compared these P responses in a
controlled burn versus a wildfire (Saa and others
1993). When temperatures reached in the forest floor
of the controlled burn were less than 329 ∞F (50 ∞C),
extractable P concentrations (ortho-phosphate) showed
no significant response. In contrast, a wildfire that
produced higher soil temperatures reduced phos-
phatase activity and increased the mineralization of
organic P, which increased ortho-phosphate P and
decreased organic P. Laboratory experiments showed
that phosphatase activity can be significantly reduced
when heating dry soils but was absent in wet soils
(DeBano and Klopatek 1988). In the pinyon-juniper
soils being studied, bicarbonate extractable P was
increased although the increases were short lived.
Ash-Bed Effect _________________
Following fire, variable amounts of ash are left
remaining on the soil surface until the ash is either
blown away or is leached into the soil by precipitation
(fig. 1.4). On severely burned sites, large layers of ash
can be present (up to several centimeters thick). These
thick accumulations of ash are conspicuously present
after piling and burning (for example, burning slash
piles). Ash deposits are usually greatest after the
burning of concentrated fuels (piled slash and wind-
rows) and least following low-severity fires.
The accumulation of thick layers of ashy residue
remaining on the soil surface after a fire is referred to
as the “ash bed effect” (Hatch 1960, Pryor 1963,
Humphreys and Lambert 1965, Renbuss and others
1972). The severe burning conditions necessary to
create these thick beds of ash affect most of the
physical, chemical, and biological soil properties. Soil
changes associated with ash beds can occur as a result
of a fire itself (soil heating), the residual effect of the
ash deposited on the soil surface (that is, the ash bed),
or a combination of both (Raison 1979).
The amount and type of ash remaining after fire
depend upon the characteristics of the fuels that are
combusted, such as fuel densities (packing ratios), fuel
moisture content, total amount of the fuel load con-
sumed, and severity of the fire (Gillon and others
1995). As a result of the fire, the ash remaining after
a fire can range from small amounts of charred dark-
colored fuel residues to thick layers of white ash that
are several centimeters thick (DeBano and others
1998). When densely packed fuels are completely
combusted, large amounts of residual white ash are
usually in one place on the soil surface following
burning (such as after piling and burning slash). The
severe heating during the fire will change the color of
the soil mineral particles to a reddish color, and where
extreme soil heating has occurred, the mineral soil
particles may be physically fused together. Silicon
melts at temperatures of 2,577 ∞F (1,414 ∞C; see
chapter 2).
Chemically, fire consumption of aboveground mate-
rial determines the amount of ash produced. Ash
consists mostly of carbonates and oxides of metals and
silica along with small amounts of P, S, and N (Raison
and others 1990). Calcium is usually the dominant
cation found in these ash accumulations. Most of the
cations are leached into the soil where they are re-
tained on the cation exchange sites located on clay or
humus particles and increase the mineral soil cation
content (fig. 3.15). The pH may exceed 12. However,
the composition of the preburn material and the tem-
perature or severity of the fire determines the chemi-
cal properties of ash. Johnston and Elliott (1998)
found that ash on uncut forest plots generally had the
highest pH and the lowest P concentrations.
Physical changes associated with the ash bed effect
mainly include changes in soil structure and perme-
ability to water. The combustion of organic matter in
the upper part of the soil profile can totally destroy soil
structure, and the ashy material produced often seals
the soil to water entry.
The biological impact of the ash bed effect is twofold.
During the fire the severe soil heating can directly
affect the long-term functioning of microbial popula-
tions because the high temperature essentially steril-
izes the upper part of the soil. Plant roots and seeds are
also destroyed so that the revegetation of these sites
depends on long-term ecological succession to return
to its former vegetative cover. Indirectly, the large
amounts of ash can affect soil microbial populations. A
study of the effects of ash, soil heating, and the ash-
heat interaction on soil respiration in two Australian
soils showed that large amounts of ash slightly

decreased respiration, but small amounts had no ef-
fect (Raison and McGarity 1980). Additions of ash to
sterilized soil produced no effect, indicating that ash
acted via its influence on active soil biological popula-
tions. The chemical nature of ash was hypothesized to
affect soil respiration by its effect on:
•
Increasing pH.
•
Changing the solubility of organic matter and
associated minerals in water.
•
Adding available nutrients for microbial
populations.

Understanding the effects of fire on soil chemical
properties is important when managing fire on all
ecosystems, and particularly in fire-dependent sys-
tems. Fire and associated soil heating combusts or-
ganic matter and releases an abundant supply of
highly soluble and available nutrients. The amount of
change in the soil chemical properties is proportional
to the amount of the organic matter combusted on the
soil surface and in the underlying mineral soil. Not
only are nutrients released from organic matter dur-
ing combustion, but there can also be a corresponding
loss of the cation exchange capacity of the organic
humus materials. The loss of cation exchange capacity
of the humus may be an important factor when burn-
ing over coarse-textured sandy soils because only a
small exchange capacity of the remaining mineral
particles is available to capture the highly mobile
cations released during the fire. Excessive leaching
and loss can thus result, which may be detrimental to
maintaining site fertility on nutrient-limiting sandy
soil.
An important chemical function of organic matter is
its role in the cycling of nutrients, especially N. Nitro-
gen is most limiting in wildland ecosystems, and its
losses by volatilization need to be evaluated before
conducting prescribed burning programs. Nitrogen
deficiencies often limit growth in some forest ecosys-
tems. Xeric and pine dominated sites, which are typi-
cally prone to burning, often exhibit low N availability,
with low inorganic N concentrations and low rates of
potential mineralization measured on these sites
(White 1996, Knoepp and Swank 1998). Forest distur-
bance, through natural or human-caused means, fre-
quently results in an increase of both soil inorganic N
concentrations and rates of potential N mineralization
and nitrification. The N increases resulting from a
combination of changes in soil moisture and tempera-
ture and the decreased plant uptake of N make more
N available for sustaining microbial populations in
the soil.
Historically, some wildland ecosystems have been
exposed to frequent fire intervals. Many of these
ecosystems are low in available N and other nutrients
such as P and cations. The cycling of nutrients, espe-
cially N, may be slow, and the exclusion of fire from
these systems often results in low N mineralization
and nitrification rates. Frequent fire, however, can
accelerate these biological rates of N mineralization
because it destroys the inhibiting substances that
hinder these processes. For example, in ponderosa
pine forests in the Southwest, monoterpenes have
been found to inhibit nitrification (White 1991). These
monoterpenes are highly flammable and as a result
are combusted during a fire. As a result, the removal
of this inhibition by fire allows N mineralization and
nitrification to proceed. It is hypothesized that these
inhibitory compounds build up over time after a fire
and decrease N mineralization. Significant differences
in monoterpenes concentrations have been established
between early and late successional stages, although
specific changes over time have not been detectable
because of the large variability between sites (White
1996).
Another study has shown that the xeric pine-hard-
wood sites in the Southern Appalachians are disap-
pearing because of past land use, drought, insects, and
the lack of regeneration by the fire-dependent pine
species (Vose 2000). This information was used to
develop an ecological model that could be used as a
forest management tool to rejuvenate these Pinus
rigida stands (fig. 3.16). This model specifies that
a cycle of disturbance due to drought and insect

outbreaks followed by fire is necessary to maintain the
pine component of these ecosystems. Without fire,
mixed hardwood vegetation dominates the stand.
Therefore, prescribed burning is proving to be an
effective tool for enhancing ecosystem health and for
sustaining, preserving, and restoring these unique
habitats.
Fire severity is probably the one most important
feature of a fire that affects the chemical soil properties.
Generalized relationships for several soil properties at
different severities are presented in figure 3.15. Nitro-
gen, organic matter, and duff decrease as fire severity
increases. Available NH4-N and cations increase. The
pH of the soil generally increases because of the loss of
organic matter and its associated organic acids, which
are replaced with an abundance of basic cations in the
ash.
Summary ______________________
The most basic soil chemical property affected by
soil heating during fires is organic matter. Organic
matter not only plays a key role in the chemistry of the
soil, but it also affects the physical properties (see
chapter 2) and the biological properties (see chapter 4)
of soils as well. Soil organic matter plays a key role in
nutrient cycling, cation exchange, and water retention
in soils. When organic matter is combusted, the stored
nutrients are either volatilized or are changed into
highly available forms that can be taken up readily by
microbial organisms and vegetation. Those available
nutrients not immobilized are easily lost by leaching
or surface runoff and erosion. Nitrogen is the most
important nutrient affected by fire, and it is easily
volatilized and lost from the site at relatively low
temperatures. The amount of change in organic mat-
ter and N is directly related to the magnitude of soil
heating and the severity of the fire. High- and moder-
ate-severity fires cause the greatest losses. Nitrogen
loss by volatilization during fires is of particular con-
cern on low-fertility sites because N can only be re-
placed by N-fixing organisms. Cations are not easily
volatilized and usually remain on the site in a highly
available form. An abundance of cations can be found
in the thick ash layers (or ash-bed) remaining on the
soil surface following high-severity fires.

Introduction ____________________
Soil biological properties involve a wide range of
living organisms that inhabit the soil, along with the
biologically mediated processes that they regulate.
The welfare of these soil organisms directly affects the
short- and long-term productivity and sustainability
of wildland ecosystems (Borchers and Perry 1990).
Soils are alive with large populations of microorgan-
isms, roots and mycorrhizae, invertebrates, and bur-
rowing animals that inhabit the upper part of the soil
profile (Singer and Munns 1996). The biological com-
ponent of soil also includes plant roots and their
associated rhizosphere, vegetative reproductive struc-
tures, and seeds. These organisms proliferate in the
soil matrix, particularly the upper layers that contain
substantial amounts of organic matter. Collectively,
these organisms contribute to soil productivity by
enhancing decomposition, nitrogen (N) cycling, hu-
mus formation, soil physical and chemical properties,
plant reproduction, disease incidence, and plant nu-
trition and stability.

Chapter 4:
Soil Biology
Biological Components of
Soils __________________________
The biological component of soils is made up of both
living and dead biomass. Dead biomass consists of
organic matter that is in various stages of decomposi-
tion, extending from undecomposed plant parts in the
litter layer to highly decomposed humus materials
that can be thoroughly mixed with the upper mineral
layers of the soil profile. Both living and dead compo-
nents are affected by fire. The effect of fire on organic
matter is discussed in detail in chapter 3. This current
chapter is devoted to the description of the important
organisms that influence soil-litter systems and the
effects that fire has upon them.
Living organisms can be classified several ways.
One method of classification is whether they are flora
or fauna. Soil flora includes algae, cyanobacteria,
mycorrhiza, and plant roots. Soil fauna includes pro-
tozoa, earthworms, and insects. The category “soil
fauna” has been further divided into micro-, meso-,
and macrofauna based on body lengths of less than
0.2 mm, .20 to 10.4 mm, and greater than 10.4 mm,

74

respectively (Wallwork 1970) (fig. 4.1). The term “mi-
croorganisms” encompasses a diverse group including
bacteria, fungi, archaebacteria, protozoa, algae, and
viruses. Some common representatives of the interme-
diate-sized soil organisms (that is, mesofauna) com-
monly found in soils are round worms, springtails, and
mites, whereas the macrofauna are represented by a
wide range of larger invertebrates such as many in-
sects, scorpions, and earthworms.
Soil organisms ranging in size from microbes to
megafauna are commonly concentrated in the surface
horizons, because these soil layers contain large
amounts of organic matter (see fig. A.1, part A), and
are active sites for microbial processes, including de-
composition and mineralization. Plant roots and in-
vertebrates can occupy the forest floor (that is, L-, F-,
and H- layer) or can be found in the uppermost layers
of organic-rich mineral soil (that is, the upper part of
the A-horizon). The H-layer represents the end prod-
uct of the microbial decomposition activity that occurs
in many soils.
Soil Microorganisms
Soil is teeming with life. Hundreds of millions of
microorganisms are found in each handful of forest
soil. No other living component in a forest (vegetation,
wildlife, insects, and so forth) comes close to matching
the sheer numbers and diversity of soil microorgan-
isms. More important, microorganisms play a major
role in nutrient cycling processes, decomposition of
organic material, improvement of soil physical charac-
teristics, and disease. They also play an important role
in providing a labile pool of nutrients (Stevenson and
Cole 1999). Hence, their influence on life in naturally
occurring ecosystems is substantial. Also, some micro-
organisms form symbiotic relationships with plants,
thereby creating a unique biological entity that can be
easily affected by fire.
Free-Living Fungi and Bacteria—Fungi and
bacteria are the workhorses of the forest soil organ-
isms (fig. 4.2). Their functions in part include de-
composition, nutrient turnover and acquisition (for

example, mycorrhizal fungi and N-fixing bacteria),
disease occurrence and suppression, and degradation
of toxic materials. Bacteria (including actinomycetes
and cyanobacteria) are the most numerous, commonly
numbering about 100 million individuals in a gram of
fertile agricultural topsoil (Paul and Clark 1989, Singer
and Munns 1996). In forest soils, the numbers of
bacteria are less, but fungal numbers can range from
5,000 to 900,000 individuals per gram of soil (Stevenson
and Cole 1999). Bacteria and fungi have been esti-
mated to contribute 2.2 tons/acre (5.0 Mg/ha) of bio-
mass to some forest soils (Bollen 1974). Fungi, although
less numerous than bacteria, often account for greater
biomass due to their larger size and dominance in
woody, organic material. The diversity of these two
groups is almost unimaginable; thousands of species
of each can be found in 0.002 pound (1 g) of soil (Torsvik
and others 1990, Molina and others 1999). And this
diversity creates the collective ability of these microor-
ganisms to adapt to fire or other environmental distur-
bances (Atlas and others 1991).
Other microbial groups also serve key roles in the
biologically induced changes in forest floor litter and
soil. Protozoa, by feeding on bacteria, release plant-
available nutrients that were previously tied up in
bacterial cells. The role of viruses and archaebacteria
(formerly classified as bacteria) in forests, however, is
not well understood. These viruses are protein-coated,
acellular strands of DNA or RNA that can be predatory
to many microorganisms, suggesting a contribution to
nutrient turnover. Archaebacteria are common in ex-
treme environments where drastic temperature, mois-
ture, acidity, or nutrient conditions preclude other
organisms. Their numbers in forest soils are assumed
to be low.
A particularly important group of free-living micro-
organisms includes those concerned with the nutrient
cycling processes described later in this chapter. Some
of these biologically mediated processes include N
fixation, mineralization, ammonification, nitrification,
and the overall decomposition process.
Specialized Root-Microbial Associations—
Some bacteria and fungi are in close association with
plant roots and develop a symbiotic relationship with
them. This suite of organisms is different than the
free-living bacteria and fungi described above because
they depend on a mutual relationship with plant roots.
They are also distinct in their relationship to fire
because both they and their host plants can be af-
fected. The most common symbiotic relationships in-
volve the root and:
•
Mycorrhizal fungi, which enhance the plant’s
ability to obtain nutrients such as phosphorus
(P) and zinc from the soil.
•
Nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which convert N gas
in the air to a form usable by plants. The
effects of fire on N-fixation and other biologi-
cal processes are discussed in more detail later
in this chapter.
A useful concept used for describing the close rela-
tionship between roots and microorganisms is the
rhizosphere. The rhizosphere is a cylindrical volume of
the soil space that extends about 0.04 inch (1 mm)
from the surface of roots (Singer and Munns 1996).
The outer boundary of the rhizophere is diffuse and
inexactly defined because the effect of the root can
extend variable distances into the soil. Simply, the
rhizosphere may be thought of as including the root
and its surrounding soil environment (fig. 4.3). Func-
tionally, the rhizosphere is important because it con-
tains a combination of the roots and associated micro-
organisms. The roots secrete products that stimulate
Figure 4.2—Fungi (A) and bacteria (B) are impor-
tant forest soil organisms due to their roles in decom-
position, nutrient turnover and acquisition, disease
occurrence, and suppression and degradation of
toxic materials. (Photos by Daniel Neary and Shirley
Owens, Michigan State University).

the bacterial and fungal activity so that the fast-
growing heterotrophic microbes are at least 10 times
denser near the root than in the rest of the soil (Singer
and Munns 1996). The heterotrophic microbial popu-
lation plays an important role in the decomposition of
organic matter and contributes to a desirable soil
structure (granular) in the root zone.
Mycorrhizal fungi found in the rhizosphere depend
on host plants for their well being (Borchers and Perry
1990). The development of mycorrhizae provides a
way for the plant roots to extend farther into the soil.
The thin fungal hyphae of the mycorrhizal fungi form
a mutual relationship with the roots of some plants,
thereby allowing the plant roots to proliferate a greater
soil mass than by the roots alone. Root-fungal associa-
tions use about 5 to 30 percent of the total photosyn-
thate that is translocated below ground by plants. Two
types of mycorrhizae are found in soil, endo-
(arbuscular) and ectomycorrhizae.
The endomycorrhizae produce structures within the
plant roots (in deciduous trees, most annual crops, and
other herbaceous species) that are called arbuscules
(Coleman and Crossley 1996, Singer and Munz 1996).
Arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi also send out hyphae,
but only a few centimeters into the surrounding soil
(Coleman and Crossley 1996).
In contrast to endomycorrhize fungi, the
ectomycorrhizae, which are primarily basidiomycetes,
grow between plant root cells (in many evergreen trees
and shrubs), but not inside them as do endomycorrhizae
(Coleman and Crossley 1996, Munns 1996).
Ectomycorrhizae can send out hyphae for several
meters into the surrounding soil to forage for nutrients
and water that are essential for the host plant. Be-
cause of their ability to proliferate the soil, hyphae of
ectomycorrhizae constitute a significant proportion of
the C allocated to belowground net primary productiv-
ity in coniferous forests (Read 1991). The hyphae
facilitate nutrient uptake, particularly of P, and are
avid colonizers of organic matter where they enhance
soil structure. Ectomycorrhizae are located at shallow
depths in the soil profile and tend to be concentrated
in the woody material during dry seasons and in the H-
layer during moist conditions. Ectomycorrhizae are
important decomposers and, as a result, obtain re-
duced C from the decomposing litter layer. Because
the ectomycorrhizae are so near the soil surface, both
the resting stages and the hyphae are easily damaged
by soil heating during a fire.
Several groups of microorganisms form N-fixing
symbiotic relationships with plants (Singer and Munns
1996). This type of symbiosis, commonly found in
rhizosphere, involves a group of actinomycetes and
rhizobia bacteria. The actinomycetes (Frankia spp.)
infect the roots of many genera of shrubs and trees
where they form N-fixing nodules. Rhizobial bacteria
(Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium spp.) also form ni-
trogen-fixing nodules with a large variety of plants
belonging to the legume family, including alfalfa,
clover, bean, pea, soybean, vetch, lupine, and lotus,
among many others. Many of these are agricultural
plants, although lupines, lotus, and clover are fre-
quently found in abundance on freshly burned wild-
land areas.
Biological Crusts—Biological crusts (fig. 4.4) are
found in hot, cool, and cold arid and semiarid regions
throughout the world and frequently occupy the bare
areas where vegetation cover is spare or totally absent
(Belnap 1994, Belnap and others 2001). These surface
communities are generically referred to as biological
soil crusts, although they may specifically be called
cryptogamic, cryptobiotic, microbiotic, or microphytic
soil crusts. The biological soil crusts are made up of a
complex community of cyanobacteria (blue-green al-
gae), lichens, mosses, microfungi, and other bacteria
Figure 4.3—The rhizosphere includes the root system
(A), associated mycorrhizae, and varying volumes of the
soil surrounding roots (B). (Photos courtesy of Nicholas
Comerford, University of Florida).

(Isichei 1990, Johansen 1993, Loftin and White 1996,
Belnap and others 2001). The algal component of this
community has the ability to fix atmospheric C and is
best recognized in forests as a component of lichens
that colonize rocks, tree trunks and exposed soil sur-
faces. Lichens represent a symbiosis among fungi and
blue-green algae or cyanobacteria. The blue-green
algae photosynthesize and fix N, while the fungi pro-
vide water and mineral nutrients. They are typically
found on erodible soils with some topographic relief, or
in shallow soil pockets in slickrock habitats (Johansen
1993). In this environment, the filamentous growth of
cyanobacteria and microfungi proliferates in the up-
per few millimeters of the soil, gluing loose particles
together and forming a matrix that stabilizes and
protects the soil surface from erosion (Belnap and
others 2001). Cryptogamic crusts are also found in
semiarid forest and shrublands, such as pinyon-juni-
per woodlands and sagebrush communities (Johansen
1993). These biological crusts can account for as much
as 70 percent of all living ground cover in arid Western
Hemisphere ecosystems (Belnap 1994).
The distribution of biological crusts is influenced by
several environmental factors (Belnap and others
2001). The total amount of crust that develops is
inversely related to vascular plant cover (in other
words, the less plant cover, the more surface available
for colonization and growth). Elevation also affects
crust distribution and cover, and both are greatest at low
elevation inland areas (less than 3,300 feet or 1,000 m)
compared to mid-elevations 3,300 to 8,200 feet
(1,000 to 2,500 m). Stable soils and rocks near, or at,
the soil surface enhance crust cover by collecting water
and armoring the surface against physical distur-
bance (Belnap and others 2001). Stable, fine-textured
soils support a greater percentage cover and a more
diverse population of organisms making up these
surface crusts. The season of precipitation also has a
major influence on the dominance of biological crusts,
and as a result, the regions that receive monsoons
have the greatest diversity of cyanobacteria and the
lowest abundance of lichens. Areas that are frequented
by fog (such as portions of the California chaparral)
frequently support lichens that intercept moisture
from the air. Finally, but not least, surface distur-
bance has a strong influence on the welfare of biologi-
cal crusts. The two most important historical impacts
on crusts have been grazing and fire (Belnap and
others 2001).
Cryptogamic crusts benefit soils in a number of
ways. The ability of these crusts to fix N, accumulate
C, and capture P enhances nutrient cycling in soils,
especially during the early successional stages (DeBano
and others 1998, Evans and Johansen 1999). Some
specific benefits of cryptogamic crusts in soils arise
from their ability to:
•
Retard erosion on desert and steppe range-
lands by binding individual soil particles (par-
ticularly in sandy soils). Soil particles are
believed to be bound as a result of the produc-
tion of extracellular polysaccharides (Lynch
and Bragg 1985).The crusts can increase or
decrease infiltration rates, although their ef-
fect on conserving soil moisture is not well-
defined (Johansen 1993).
•
Fix gaseous N. The cyanobacteria component
of this symbiosis has been estimated to fix as
much as 22 pounds/acre (25 kg/ha) of N annu-
ally (West and Skujins 1977). The amount of N
fixed, however, is largely dependent upon the
abundance and activity of the crusts and fa-
vorable climatic conditions (Loftin and White
1996).
•
Enhance organic matter buildup. Biological
crusts in semiarid areas of the Southwestern
United States have been estimated to accumu-
late 5.3 to 20.5 pounds/acre (6 to 23 kg/ha) of
C annually (Jeffries and others 1993).
•
Increase P levels by retaining fine soil par-
ticles from loss by erosion (Kleiner and Harper
1977).
•
Facilitate seedling establishment. Although
germination can be inhibited by allelopathic
substances produced by the crust, seedling
establishment generally seems to benefit by
their presence (St. Clair and others 1984).

Soil Meso- and Macrofauna
The most common members of the mesofaunal group
of soil organisms are the mites (members of the order
Acari). The mites can be abundant in soils, particu-
larly forest soils, where a 0.2 pound (100 g) sample of
soil may contain as many as 500 mite species repre-
senting almost 100 genera (Coleman and Crossley
1996). Other mesofauna found in soil include Rotifera,
Nematoda (round worms), and Collembola (springtails).
Macrofauna occupying the soil and litter in forest,
shrubland, and grassland can be placed in two broad
classes—those that spend all or most of their time in
the litter and uppermost mineral soil layers, and those
that inhabit these habitats only temporarily or not at
all. Several of the more permanent faunal groups
include those that reside in the soil and litter but also
a group that dwells beneath stones, logs, under bark,
or in similar protected habitats. These organisms are
collectively called the cryptozoa. Three orders of higher
insects—Isoptera (termites), Hymenoptera (ants, bees,
wasps, and sawflies), and Coleoptera (beetles)—all
play a major role in improving soil structure and
enriching soil chemistry and associated food webs
(Coleman and Crossley1996). The cryptozoa group
includes millipedes, centipedes, and scorpions. These
macrobiota enhance decomposition of organic matter,
nutrient cycling, soil structure, and the long-term
primary productivity of these ecosystems.
Earthworms (Oligochaeta) are a special class of the
macrofauna that has long been recognized as an im-
portant component of healthy soil systems (Coleman
and Crossley 1996, Lavelle 1988).Their large abun-
dance and biomass in some soils make them a major
factor in soil biology (fig. 4.5). Earthworms fall into
three general groups: those that dwell in the surface
litter, those that are active in the mineral soil layers,
and those that move vertically between deeper soil
layers and the soil surface. These organisms act as
biological agents that decompose litter and mineralize
C in both the litter and underlying soil (Zhang and
Hendrix 1995). Earthworm digestion increases both
the mineralization and humification of organic matter
(Lavelle 1988). Earthworms are best known for their
beneficial effects of building and conserving soil struc-
ture, which results from burrowing and soil ingestion
activities (Lavelle 1988). Earthworm activities en-
hance soil structure by increasing the number of
water-stable aggregates, and the creation of burrows
and casts increases soil porosity, which improves both
aeration and water movement through the soil.
Roots and Reproductive Structures
Many of the plant roots, vegetative reproductive
structures, and seeds are found immediately on the
surface of the soil or are distributed downward
throughout the soil profile. These plant parts include
tap roots, fibrous surface roots, rhizomes, stolons,
root crowns, and bulbs. The welfare of the plant roots
and reproductive structures is important to the
sustainability of plant biomass and productivity of
all terrestrial ecosystems found throughout the world,
particularly in those ecosystems that experience re-
peated and regular fires. Closely associated with the
roots are a suite of symbiotic microorganisms found
in the soil (see the previous section Specialized Root-
Microbial Associations).
Amphibians, Reptiles, and Small
Mammals
Amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals inhabit
holes and cavities in the upper part of the soil where
they feed on invertebrates, plant parts (seeds), and
other organic debris found on or near the soil surface.
Burrowing activities and deposition of fecal material
by these larger animals contribute to the aeration and
fertility of wildland soils.
Biologically Mediated Processes in
Soils __________________________
The living organisms described above are involved
in numerous biological processes that regulate nutri-
ent cycling and contribute to soil productivity and
ecosystem health. The nutrient cycling processes for
nonfire environments were presented in figure 3.2.
Figure 4.5—Earthworms have long been recognized
as an important component of healthy soil systems
that function as key biological agents in decomposing
litter and mineralizing carbon in both the litter and
underlying soil. (Photo courtesy of Earl Stone, Univer-
sity of Florida).

Nutrients enter the soil by precipitation, dry fall,
N-fixation, and geochemical weathering of rocks. Nu-
trients in soil organic matter that accumulates on the
soil surface are slowly changed to forms that are
available to plants by the biological processes of de-
composition and mineralization. The leakage of nutri-
ents from these nonfire ecosystems is usually low, and
only small losses occur via volatilization, erosion,
leaching, and denitrification. Nutrient cycling in
nonfire ecosystems represents a dynamic balance
among the processes regulating decomposition, min-
eralization (ammonification and nitrification), N-fixa-
tion and denitrification, and nutrient immobilization
and uptake by plants. The long-term sustainability of
wildland ecosystems depends on this regular and
consistent cycling of nutrients in order to sustain plant
growth (DeBano and others 1998).
Decomposition and Mineralization
Organic matter that is deposited on a soil surface is
decomposed by soil organisms and incorporated into
the underlying soil (mainly as humus). During decom-
position, C stored in the organic matter is recycled into
the atmosphere as CO2, while N is stored in microbial
biomass until it is released during mineralization.
Some of the C and N immobilized as microbial tissue
can be microbially converted into resistant humic
substances (via a process called humification). The
humus fraction of soils in natural ecosystems under-
goes both continuous decomposition and mineraliza-
tion, so that the total soil organic matter and N content
may remain in a steady state condition until distur-
bance, such as fire, occurs. Several factors that affect
the decomposition of organic matter are the composi-
tion of the decomposing litter (substrate quality),
environmental factors (moisture and temperature),
types of microorganisms involved, and other soil fac-
tors including soil pH and deficiencies of inorganic
nutrients (P, K, and micronutrients).
An important end product of decomposition is the
release of nutrients that can be used by plants. These
highly available nutrients are formed during mineral-
ization, which is defined as the conversion of an ele-
ment from an organic form to an inorganic state as the
result of microbial activity (Soil Science Society of
America 2001). The mineralization of organic matter
involves the transformation of organic N compounds
(such as proteins and amino acids) into NH4 (ammoni-
fication) and, subsequently, into nitrite (NO2) and
NO3 (nitrification); and the conversion of organic C
into CO2 (DeBano and others 1998). Both ammonifica-
tion and nitrification are affected by fire. Nitrification
is carried out mainly by autotrophic microorganisms,
which derive their energy solely from the oxidation of
NH4 and NO3 (Haynes 1986). Several genera of au-
totrophic bacteria that can oxidize NH4-N to NO2 are
Nitrosomonas, Nitrosolobus, and Nitrospira. The oxi-
dation of NO2 to NO3, however, is almost exclusively
done by Nitrobacter in natural systems (Haynes 1986).
Approximately 30 percent of all the N that is nitrified
in natural ecosystems is done by faunal populations
(Verhoef and Brussaard 1990).
Nitrogen Cycling Processes
Nitrogen is unique among the soil nutrients because
it is present in the soil almost entirely as part of
organic compounds. No inorganic N reserve is nor-
mally available to replace the soil N lost by volatiliza-
tion during a fire (Harvey and others 1976). Therefore,
N is recovered from the atmosphere by N-fixation and
atmospheric deposition (DeBano and others 1998).
Nitrogen-Fixation—Nitrogen-fixation is the con-
version of molecular N (N2) to ammonia and, subse-
quently, to organic combinations or forms utilizable in
biological processes (Soil Science Society of America
2001). The atmosphere supplies N to soil in natural
ecosystems mainly through organisms that fix inert
N2 into forms that can be used by plants. Nitrogen
additions to the soil by N-fixing organisms (free-living
and symbiotic) counterbalance the volatilized N that
is lost during combustion and subsequent leaching of
soluble N compounds into and through the soil follow-
ing fire (DeBano and others 1998). Nitrogen-fixation is
primarily by two groups of microorganisms found in
the soil, namely those that fix N symbiotically and
those that are free-living.
Symbiotic N-fixation: This form of N-fixation is
carried out by symbiotic microorganisms that are
associated with the roots of higher plants (symbiotic)
and obtain the energy required for fixing N being from
the host plant. The most common symbiotic relation-
ships found in wildland ecosystems are those formed
by rhizobia or actinomycetes associated with plant
roots. Rhizobium bacteria are found associated with
the roots of leguminous plants that make up about 700
genera in the Leguminosae family (Haynes 1986).
Locust trees are an example of legumes that enhance
the N-status of forest soils (Klemmedson 1994). Nitro-
gen-fixation by actinomycetes is also widespread in
wildland ecosystems, and an example of forest trees
having this type of symbiosis is the genus Alnus, which
has been reported to have enriched the soil with 18 to
129 pounds/acre (20 to156 kg/ha) of N per year depend-
ing on the local site conditions and stand density (Van
Cleve and others 1971, Jurgensen and others 1979).
Brush species having actinomycete-driven N-fixing
capabilities are bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) and
mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus spp.).
Nonsymbiotic N-fixation: Over the past 3 to 4 de-
cades, studies on N-fixation in soils have determined
that free-living microbes are also able to fix N in

80
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
substantial amounts, particularly in forest soils
(Jurgensen and others 1997). These free-living mi-
crobes obtain the energy necessary for N-fixation dur-
ing the decomposition of large woody debris (Harvey
and others 1989). Coarse woody debris consists of tree
limbs, boles, and roots that are greater than 3.0 inches
(7.5 cm) in diameter and are in various stages of decay
(Graham and others 1994). It is produced when trees
die and their boles fall to the soil surface. The death of
trees occurs because of old age, insect and disease
attacks, devastating natural events, and human ac-
tivities (timber harvesting debris, as one example).
Much of the coarse woody debris found in forests is on
the soil surface and is partially or totally covered by
soil and humus layers. This coarse woody debris, and
associated smaller organic matter, enhances the physi-
cal, chemical, and biological properties of the soil and
thereby contributes directly to site productivity. In
addition, it provides a favorable microenvironment for
seedling establishment and growth.
A particularly important role of coarse woody debris
is that it serves as a potentially valuable source of
nonsymbiotic N-fixation. Extensive studies in the In-
land Pacific Northwest show that up to 50 percent of
the total N fixed on a site is contributed from the large
woody debris component (Jurgensen and others 1997).
Soil wood found in these forests is a product of brown-
rot decay and is made up of heartwood from pine and
Douglas-fir trees. It is relatively resistant to decay
and, as a result, can remain in the soil for hundreds of
years. The accumulation of coarse woody debris and
the fixation of N on warm, dry sites are lower than on
the wetter, more productive sites.
Denitrification—Denitrification is the reverse pro-
cess whereby NO3 is reduced to N2 and N2O biologi-
cally. It is the major mechanism that returns N, which
was originally fixed from the atmosphere, back into
the atmosphere (Richardson and Vepraskas 2001).
Denitrification typically occurs in saturated and wa-
ter-logged soils found in wetlands (see chapter 8).
Nitrogen losses are generally related to its availability,
and significant amounts of N up to 54 pounds/acre/
year (60 kg/ha/year) have been reported where NO3
loadings occur as a result of nonpoint runoff or from
other sources.
Fire Effects on Organisms and
Biological Processes ____________
Fire affects biological organisms either directly or
indirectly. Direct effects are those short-term changes
that result when any particular organism is exposed
directly to the flames, glowing combustion, hot gases,
or is trapped in the soil and other environments
where enough heat is transferred into the organism’s
immediate surroundings to raise the temperature
sufficiently to either kill or severely injure the organ-
ism. Indirect effects usually involve longer duration
changes in the environment that impact the welfare of
the biological organisms after the fire has occurred.
These indirect effects can involve habitat, food supply,
competition, and other more subtle changes that affect
the reestablishment and succession of plants and
animals following fire.
Soil Microorganisms
Environmental Constraints and Microbial
Growth—In this section we provide a brief introduc-
tion on the effects of different environmental factors—
temperature, moisture, and substrate availability—
on microbial life so the reader will understand microbial
reactions to fire. A subsequent section then describes
the response of different microorganisms to fire.
Temperature: Microbial communities are well
adapted to a wide range of prevailing temperature
regimes. Drastic changes in temperature during soil
heating can result in mortality and shifts in species
composition of survivors (Baath and others 1995,
Pietikainen and others 2000). Lethal temperatures
are as low as 122 ∞F (50 ∞C) for some bacteria, particu-
larly for important gram-negative organisms, such as
nitrifiers, that have thin cell walls (Wells and others
1979). Above 392 ∞F (200 ∞C), virtually all bacteria are
killed. Fungi are generally killed at lower tempera-
tures than bacteria, and lethal temperatures range
between 122 and 311 ∞F (50–155 ∞C) (Wells and others
1979). From a practical standpoint, the threshold
temperatures for bacteria and fungi are usually reached
to a depth of 2 inches (5 cm) or more in the mineral soil
during medium- or high-severity fires (Theodorou and
Bowen 1982, Shea 1993, Giardina and others 2000).
As a result, decreases in microbial populations due to
the direct effect of soil heating are common immedi-
ately following either wildfire (Acea and Carballas
1996, Hernandez and others 1997, Prietro-Fernandez
and others 1998) or some higher severity prescribed
burns (Ahlgren and Ahlgren 1965, Pietikainen and
Fritze 1993). Indirect long-term change in soil tem-
perature can also result from modifications to vegeta-
tion cover and microclimate following fire. However,
compared to the immediate and detrimental effects of
soil heating, these longer term temperature changes
are subtle and can even produce a slight stimulation of
microbial population size and activity (Bissett and
Parkinson 1980).
Moisture and oxygen: Microorganisms thrive in moist
soil. In fact, most can be considered aquatic organisms
by nature of their requirement of aqueous solution for
cell movement. Filamentous fungi and actinomycetes
are an exception. Optimum moisture content for

microbial activity is typically near 55 percent of soil
water-holding capacity (Horwath and Paul 1994). A
combination of water and oxygen (O2)content in the
soil affects the level of microbial activity. As soils dry,
increased cellular energy is required to maintain tur-
gor, resulting in reduced growth and activity. Micro-
bial processes essentially cease when soil becomes air-
dry, at which time cells become dormant. Conversely,
excessive moisture displaces O2 and inhibits the
metabolic activity of the dominant aerobic microbial
population.
Soil moisture is a crucial factor in determining
microbial survival during fire. Water is capable of
absorbing large amounts of heat energy, thereby re-
sulting in less temperature rise and reduced fire sever-
ity for a given heat input. Frandsen and Ryan (1986)
found a temperature reduction of more than 932 ∞F
(500 ∞C) when soil was wetted prior to burning, thus
providing a presumed advantage to microorganisms.
Conversely, more biological damage can result in
moist soil compared to dry soil at a given temperature
maximum because water is a better conductor of heat
than air, and microorganisms are more metabolically
active in moist soil. For example, Dunn and others
(1985) estimated that 95 percent of bacteria are killed
in moist soil and only 25 percent are killed in dry soil
at equivalent soil temperature (158 ∞F or 70 ∞C).
Burning when soils are dry is recommended if severe
soil heating is anticipated. An additional concern is
the potential decrease in soil water availability follow-
ing fire. Less soil water is available after forest fires as
a result of decreased water infiltration and storage
due to water repellency, and increased water loss by
soil surface evaporation. Only one report was found
where moisture changes following fire were suspected
of altering microbial properties (Raison and others
1986). The reserchers found up to a 34 percent reduc-
tion in eucalyptus litter decay after moderate-severity
prescribed fire and hypothesized that the change in
decomposition resulted from moisture limitations cre-
ated by increased surface evaporation. This response
was suspected to be short-lived, however, because of
the rapid reaccumulation of forest floor material in
these systems and the anticipated reduction of surface
evaporation.
Substrate availability: Most soil microorganisms
are heterotrophic, meaning they require preformed,
organic material in the forest floor or mineral soil for
their source of energy. Therefore, any fire-induced
changes in the quality or quantity of organic matter
may have long-lasting implications for the biological
activity of soil (Lucarotti and others 1978, Palmborg
and Nordgren 1993, Pietikainen and others 2000).
Surprisingly, most forests have insufficient reserves
of degradable organic material to provide for optimal
microbial growth. Forest soil microorganisms, in ef-
fect, are more likely to be C-limited than by water or
other essential nutrients (that is, N, P). As a corollary,
the removal of surface organic matter by high-severity
fires can reduce microbial population size and activity
(Fernandez and others 1997, Prietro-Fernandez and
others 1998). Even with fires of low to medium sever-
ity, the consumption of downed woody material can
influence an important reservoir of mycorrhizal fungi
(Harvey and others 1976, 1980a).
In addition to heterotrophs, the microbial commu-
nity includes a small yet biologically important group
of bacteria that obtain their energy from the oxidation
of inorganic compounds (autotrophs). Nitrifiers have
received the most attention among autotrophic organ-
isms because of their role in the N cycle and their
sensitivity to soil heating (Dunn and others 1985).
Nitrifiers obtain energy from the oxidation of NO4
and NO2, and release NO3 as an end product.
Response of Soil Microorganisms to Fire—Fire
affects most organisms that inhabit the belowground
environment in both direct and indirect ways (Ahlgren
and Ahlgren 1965, Borchers and Perry 1990). Fire
impacts soil organisms directly by killing or injuring
the organisms, and indirectly by its effect on plant
succession, soil organic matter transformations, and
microclimate. Heat penetration into the soil during a
fire affects biological organisms located below the soil
surface, depending on the heat transfer mechanism,
soil moisture content, and duration of combustion.
Because many living organisms and the organic
matter in soils are located on, or near, the soil surface,
they are exposed to heat radiated by flaming surface
fuels and smoldering forest floor fuels (fig. 4.6).
Figure 4.6—High-severity wildfires can remove
nearly all the litter and duff and associated micro-
bial populations present on the forest floor, leaving
only gray ash. (Photo by Kevin Ryan).

Depending on fire severity, organisms in the organic
forest floor can be killed outright, although those in
the deeper soil horizons, or in isolated unburned loca-
tions, survive. Even low-severity fires can damage
organisms that are on or near the soil surface because
most biota are damaged at lower temperatures than
those that cause changes in physical and chemical soil
properties during fire (table 4.1).
How do microorganisms respond to fire? Without
question, fire is lethal. It also modifies the habitat of
microorganisms by destroying organic matter, altering
soil temperature and moisture regimes, and changing
the postfire vegetation community and rates of organic
matter accumulation. Consequently, changes in micro-
bial population size and activity are common following
wildfire and prescribed fire (see Ahlgren 1974, Raison
1979, Borchers and Perry 1990, Neary and others 1999
for reviews). Most reviews are quick to point out, how-
ever, that microbial responses are variable, or even
unpredictable, depending on site conditions, fire inten-
sity and severity, and sampling protocol. But if micro-
bial responses are unpredictable, then no assistance
can be offered to managers in developing fire prescrip-
tions that meet operational objectives while minimiz-
ing risks to soil biota. The following discussion will
challenge this concept in attempting to offer practical
guidelines for fire managers.
If microbial life was only a function of temperature,
moisture, and substrate availability, then the refine-
ment of fire prescription guidelines based on soil biotic
responses would be straightforward. Unfortunately, it
is not that simple because the ability of most microor-
ganisms to recover from disturbance is complex. Mi-
crobial communities are unmatched in physiological
diversity and genetic malleability—properties that
permit growth in any environment—and they have
the ability to degrade nearly all known compounds.
Resilience, therefore, is a trademark of the microbial
community. As an example, rapid declines in soil
microbial populations due to fire are usually transi-
tory. Population sizes often match or surpass preburn
levels within a growing season (Ahlgren and Ahlgren
1965, Renbuss and others 1973). Successful
recolonization following fire is a function of several
factors, including incomplete mortality of native popu-
lations, spore germination, influx of wind-blown or-
ganisms, and microbial growth stimulations from avail-
able nutrients. An important caveat is that not all
microorganisms respond alike; differential responses
by community members have been observed following
fire. For example, Harvey and others (1980a) found
poor recolonization of ectomycorrhizae, and Widden
and Parkinson (1975) found a similar response for
genera Trichoderma, an important antagonist to plant
pathogens, following slash burning.
Some obvious observations can be made. Microbial
responses to fire are easiest to predict at the opposing
ends of the fire-severity continuum: (1) intense wild-
fire can have severe and sometimes long-lasting ef-
fects on microbial population size, diversity, and func-
tion; (2) low-severity underburning generally has an
inconsequential effect on microorganisms. From there
it becomes more difficult to predict microbial adapta-
tion because results from medium- to high-severity
slash fire and underburn studies vary widely among
habitat types.
Wildfire: High-severity wildfires can remove nearly
all the litter and duff and associated microbial popula-
tions present on the forest floor, leaving only gray or
orange ash (fig. 4.6). Even mineral soil C is consumed
during wildfires. Recent studies show a range of 5 to 60
percent loss of organic material in the surface mineral
soil (Fernandez and others 1997, Hernandez and oth-
ers 1997, Prietro-Fernandez and others 1998). Re-
lated declines in microbial biomass immediately
following high-severity fires have been as high as

96 percent (Hernandez and others 1997). Microbial
respiration and extracellular enzyme production (Saa
and others 1998)—strong indicators of microbial ac-
tivity and viability—also decline dramatically follow-
ing wildfire. Fungi appear more sensitive to wildfire
than bacteria. For example, fungal propagules were
undetectable 1 week after a stand-replacing fire in a
central Oregon ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) for-
est, while the viable bacteria population was only
slightly reduced (D. Shields, personal communica-
tion). Similar responses were reported following wild-
fire in a pine forest of Spain (Vazquez and others
1993). Differences in response between bacteria and
fungi may be attributable to greater heat sensitivity of
fungi, soil pH increases after burning that favor bac-
teria, or the excessive loss of organic material.
No ecosystem remains sterile, even after severe
disturbance. Most studies show stable recovery of
microbial populations in the mineral soil to prefire
levels within 1 to 4 years after wildfire (Vazquez and
others 1993, Acea and Carballas 1996, Prietro-
Fernandez and others 1998). However, reduced micro-
bial biomass has been reported for as many as 11 years
after fire (Dumontet and others 1996). Whether the
microbial community will fully recolonize depends on
the time required for recovering the forest floor layer.
Not only are microbial populations and processes
suppressed during this recovery period (Lucarotti and
others 1978), but the potential erosive loss of soil is
high. Or, as suggested by Giovannini and others (1987),
burnt soils will slowly regenerate as long as erosive
processes can be avoided.
Low-severity prescribed fire: Almost by definition,
low-severity prescribed fire has a minimal effect on
soil biota (fig. 4.7). The maximum temperatures are
generally nonlethal, except for the upper litter layer
(Shea 1993), and therefore the consumption of forest
floor habitat is limited. Changes in microbial activ-
ity, in fact, often show a positive response to this type
of fire, particularly with respect to N-fixation
(Jorgensen and Wells 1971) and N availability (Schoch
and Binkley 1986, White 1986, Knoepp and Swank
1993a,b). Rates of litter decay (White 1986, Monleon
and Cromack 1996) and enzyme activity (Boerner
and others 2000) are generally unaffected by low-
severity underburning. Such results are not univer-
sal, however. Monleon and others (1997) found that N
mineralization was reduced at sites burned either 5
or 12 years earlier by low- to medium-severity pre-
scribed fire. They suggested that fire-induced changes
in N mineralization possibly contributed to a decline
in the long-term site productivity of ponderosa pine
stands in central Oregon.
While single-entry underburning is generally con-
sidered harmless, repeated burning has been shown to
substantially reduce microbial population size and
activity (Jorgensen and Hodges 1970, Bell and Binkley
1989, Tongway and Hodgkinson 1992, Eivazi and
Bayan 1996). This observation reflects a cumulative
reduction in forest floor and total nutrients with fre-
quent burning. Most studies have compared either
annual burning or short-term repeated fires (2 to 4
years). The long-term impact of repeated burning
every 7 to 20 or more years on soil organic matter,
nutrient content, and microbial processes is not un-
derstood. As a consequence, Tiedemann and others
(2000) urge caution in the use of frequent fire and
suggest including partial harvesting as a complemen-
tary practice to reduce wildfire risk and extend the
period between prescribed burning.
Slash burning: The effect of slash burning will
depend on both the pattern and amounts of fuels
burned. When slash is piled and burned (for example,
pushing and burning operations used in some pinyon-
juniper eradication programs) the burned areas are
highly visible after the fire (fig. 4.8). On these burned
areas, deep layers of white ash may accumulate, and
the underlying soil is usually exposed to extended soil
heating, which can sterilize to a depth of several
centimeters. Although the severe heating under the
piles of fuel are damaging to the soil, only a small
percentage of the total area may be affected. To avoid
this damage to the soil, the slash can be scattered and
burned, thereby minimizing the severe soil heating
that occurs under piled fuels.
The literature contains numerous references to site-
specific responses of microorganisms to medium and
high-severity slash burning. A common theme is that
the response of microorganisms is dictated by their
habitat: organisms in the forest floor struggle to sur-
vive and recolonize, while those in the mineral soil do
Figure 4.7—Low-severity prescribed fire has a mini-
mal effect on soil biota because maximum tempera-
tures are generally nonlethal, except for the upper
litter layer, and consumption of forest floor habitat is
limited. (Photo by Daniel Neary).

not. This comes as little surprise because the tempera-
ture in the forest floor can easily reach 1,110 ∞F (600 ∞C)
or higher during burning (Renbuss and others 1973,
Shea 1993), consuming both the microorganisms and
their habitat. In fact, substantial changes in forest
floor microbial biomass and community structure have
been reported to occur during a soil heating experi-
ment at a temperature of 445 ∞F (230 ∞C) (Pietikainen
and others 2000). Soil heating was less severe in the
mineral soil, resulting in a much shorter fluctuation
period before the microbial community stabilizes. The
following examples illustrate this theme.
Recent findings from slash burns in Finland show
detrimental effects of slash burning on microbial bio-
mass (Pietikainen and Fritze 1993), activity (Fritze
and others 1994, 1998), and community structure
(Baath and others 1995, Pietikainen and others 2000)
in the forest floor. Failure of the microbial community
to respond rapidly has been attributed to a decline in
organic matter quantity (Baath and others 1995) and
quality (Fritze and others 1993), and the pyrolytic
production of toxic compounds (Fritze and others 1998).
Also, microbial populations were unable to respond to
the input of nutrient-rich ash. These studies were
relatively short term, ranging from 1 month to 3 years
postfire. As a result, the length of time required before
the forest floor microbial community reaches preburn
levels is unclear, yet it might take up to 12 years
(Fritze and others 1993). Related declines in microbial
function have been reported in other forest types.
Staddon and others (1998) found microbial-mediated
enzyme activity was suppressed 4 years after slash
burning in jack pine (P. banksiana). Meanwhile,
Jurgensen and others (1992) found a 26 percent de-
cline in N-fixation by free-living bacteria during the
first 2 years following a relatively high-severity slash
fire that consumed 61 percent of the forest floor in a
cedar-hemlock forest.
In contrast with the forest floor, microbial recovery
in mineral soil following intense slash burning is
impressive. For example, Renbuss and others (1973)
examined viable bacterial and fungal populations af-
ter a high-severity log pile burn that produced tem-
peratures of 735 to 1,110 ∞F (400–600 ∞C) in the upper
2 inches (5 cm) of soil. Although the soil was initially
sterilized by fire, bacteria had recolonized to preburn
levels within 1 week after ignition. Their population
size remained at or above the level of the control soil for
the length of the study (1 year). Fungi and actino-
mycetes were slower to recolonize, yet their popula-
tions returned to prefire level by the end of the study.
Chambers and Attiwill (1994) confirmed the “ash-bed”
effect in a controlled soil heating experiment. No
differences in microbial population sizes were found
133 days after heating soil to 1,110 ∞F (600 ∞C) when
compared to unheated soil. Similar responses are
common in field studies (Ahlgren and Ahlgren 1965,
Theodorou and Bowen 1982, Deka and Mishra 1983,
Van Reenen and others 1992, Staddon and others
1998), whereas some controlled soil heating experi-
ments have found longer delays in recolonization (Dunn
and others 1979, Diaz-Ravina and others 1996, Acea
and Carballas 1999). Differences between field and
controlled-environment studies suggest the impor-
tance of wind- or animal-transported inoculum for
recolonization.
Specialized Root-Microbial Associations—My-
corrhizal fungi are easily affected by fire, and the
extent of damage depends upon fire severity, the repro-
ductive structures exposed to soil heating (such as
spores or hyphae), and the type of fungi (such as endo-
or ectomycorrhiaze). Mycorrhizae and roots frequently
occupy the uppermost duff layers of soil and as a result
are subjected to lethal soil temperatures during a fire
because these layers are frequently combusted, par-
ticularly during medium- and high-severity fires. In
general, vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae are less
affected by disturbances that destroy aerial biomass
(including fire) than are ectomycorrhizal fungi be-
cause they form symbiotic relationships with a wider
range of plant species (Puppi and Tartaglini 1991).
Also, ectomycorrhizae are more abundant in the litter
layer compared to vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae,
which tend to concentrate in the lower mineral soil
horizons (Reddell and Malajczuk 1984). As a result,
fire that destroys only the litter layer would favor
vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae.
The general relationships discussed above have been
documented by several studies that show a decline in
Figure 4.8—Piling and burning slash after a fuel
harvesting operation in pinyon-juniper woodlands
can create thick layers of white ash and extensive
soil heating. (Photo by Malchus Baker).

the formation of both ectomycorrhizae (Harvey and
others 1980b, Schoenberger and Perry 1982, Parke
and others 1984) and vesicular arbuscular mycor-
rhizae (Klopatek and others 1988, Vilariño and Arines
1991) within the first growing season following fire.
Mycorrhizae were not per se eliminated by fire in these
studies. Instead, the percentage of roots infected by
mycorrhizal fungi was reduced. As an example,
Klopatek and others (1988) found vesicular arbuscular
mycorrhizae infection declined from 41 percent at
preburn to 22 percent within 24 hours of burning the
organic layer of a pinyon pine (P. edulis Engelm.) soil.
Work by Harvey and others (1976, 1980a,b, 1981) has
also clearly established a relationship between re-
duced ectomycorrhizal root tip formation and slash
burning on difficult-to-regenerate sites in western Mon-
tana. They emphasize the importance of maintaining
adequate soil humus and wood (up to 45 percent by
volume) as refugia for mycorrhizae on these sites.
Not all studies, however, have reported a detrimen-
tal relationship between mycorrhizal formation and
fire. Several studies have shown no effect of burning
on mycorrhizae by the end of the first growing season
(Pilz and Perry 1984, Deka and others 1990, Bellgard
and others 1994, Miller and others 1998). In fact, Herr
and others (1994) found a slight increase in
ectomycorrhizal infection on eastern white pine (P.
strobus) with increasing fire severity. Visser (1995)
examined ectomycorrhizal development in an age se-
quence of jack pine stands regenerating following fire.
More than 90 percent of the root tips were mycorrhizal
regardless of time since burning (from 6 to 122 years).
She suggested that successful recolonization of mycor-
rhizae on jack pine seedlings was a function of (1)
avoidance of lethal temperatures by location in soil
profile, (2) resistance of spores and resting structures
to lethal temperatures, (3) wind or animal dispersal of
spores, and (4) survival on alternative plant hosts such
as manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.).
Finally, there is no clear evidence that fire impairs
the function of mycorrhizae in plant nutrition and
growth. Studies showing a decline in mycorrhizal
infection after fire have seen minor or no decline in
seedling survival or short-term growth (Schoenberger
and Perry 1982, Parke and others 1984). Two simpli-
fied explanations are plausible: (1) either the flush of
nutrients after fire makes mycorrhizae temporarily
superfluous, or (2) the decline in root infection (such as
a decline from 40 to 20 percent root tip colonization
following burning) has no relationship to function. The
argument in the second explanation is that mycor-
rhizal function is still effective whether root systems
are completely or partially infected. Intermediate- or
long-term studies are needed to resolve this issue.
Biological Crusts—The patchy nature of native
plant communities in arid and semiarid lands produces
a discontinuous source of fuels and results in a mosaic
of fire intensities (Whisenant 1990). The biological
crusts themselves provide little fuel to carry fire and
thereby provide a “refugia” that slows down the spread
of fire and minimizes its severity (Rosentreter 1986).
However, once fire destroys cryptogamic crusts, it
can take several years for their populations to rede-
velop to prefire levels (DeBano and others 1998). High-
severity fires during the dry summer months cause
the greatest damage to biological crusts. The recovery
following fire can be fast or slow, depending upon the
type of crust (algal or lichenous), soil conditions, and
climate. For example, crusts can take much longer to
develop in hotter and more arid shrublands such as
occurred on a site in a blackbrush (Coleogyne
ramosissima) community in southern Utah (Callison
and others 1985). This site did not show any crypto-
gamic development following a severe range fire after
37 years. Likewise, annual fires for 7 years have been
reported to destroy cryptogamic crusts on degraded
semiarid woodlands in Australia (Greene and others
1990).
Low-severity fires, in contrast, may leave the struc-
tural matrix of the crust intact (Johansen and others
1993). For example, after a single fire in a semiarid
shrub-steppe it only took 4 years for the crusts to reach
prefire levels. This study showed that the components
making up the cryptogamic crust (such as algae,
cyanobacteria, or lichens) affect the rate of recovery
following disturbance. Algae recovered from distur-
bance most rapidly and returned to prefire densities
within 1 to 5 years. Historically, fires in the South-
western deserts probably were exposed to small, low-
intensity, and patchy fires because of the sparse and
discontinuous vegetation (Allen 1998, Belnap and
others 2001). This type of fire behavior most likely had
a minimum effect on the biological crusts common to
this area.
In general, algal cells of many species are usually
able to survive even the most severe disturbance, so
the dispersal into and recolonization of burned areas
is faster (Johansen 1993). For example, the first or-
ganisms to recolonize the soil under burned English
heaths were algae (Warcup 1981). Algae are also
favored by the higher pH after fire, and species with
windblown propagules are able to recolonize disturbed
areas rapidly (DeBano and others 1998). In contrast,
filamentous cyanophytes (blue-green bacteria) are less
likely to recolonize by wind dispersal because of their
size. Compared to algae, mosses and lichens are slower
to reestablish themselves. Acrocarpic mosses were
found to reoccupy burned sites in the Mediterranean
area within 9 to 15 months after fire (De Las Heras and
others 1993). Lichens that produce vegetative diaspores
can move into disturbed areas more quickly than
lichens that do not produce these propagules (Johansen

86
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
and others 1984). Some lichens can take 10 to 20 years
to develop diverse and abundant communities (Ander-
son and others 1982).
Soil Meso- and Macrofauna
Most research results on the effect of fire on meso-
and macrofauna are reported in terms of general
groups of soil invertebrates, including insects and
other arthropod assemblages, and earthworms. In-
sects, for example, may have representatives in both
the meso- and macrofauna groups (fig. 4.1; also see
earlier discussion in this chapter on soil meso- and
macrofauna). Another important ramification of fire
and these organisms is the postfire infestation of
forests and other ecosystems by insects as a result of
the effect of fire on the health of the postfire vegeta-
tion. The response of all the above organisms depends
to a large degree on the frequency and severity of fire.
The magnitude of short-term changes undergone by
invertebrate populations in response to fire depends
on both fire severity and frequency, the location of
these organisms at the time of the fire, and the species
subjected to fire. In the case of either an uncontrolled
wildfire (high fire severity), and prescribed fire (low
fire severity), the effect on invertebrates can be tran-
sitory or longer lasting (Lyon and others 1978). Both
types of fires contain zones of high and low fire sever-
ity, but wildfires are more likely to burn larger, con-
tiguous areas. The long-term abundance of arthropod
populations, however, can remain high because of
their resiliency to both intensity and frequency of
burning (Andersen and Müller 2000).
Some studies show the effect of different severities
and frequencies of fire on invertebrates. One study in
P. sylvestris forests in Sweden showed that the overall
mortality of invertebrates depended on the proportion
of organic soil consumed by the fire and that the
mortality ranged from 59 to 100 percent. Inverte-
brates that lived deeper in the soil had less mortality
than those that colonized the vegetation and litter
layers (Wikars and Schimmel 2001). Other character-
istics that favored survival included greater mobil-
ity in the soil and thick protective cuticles (as is found
in the taxa Oribatediae and Elateridae).
A study of the response of insects and other
arthropods to prescribed burn frequency in prairie
ecosystems showed that the changes in the physical
environment and plant communities following pre-
scribed fires can result in the development of distinctly
different arthropod communities on the frequently
burned sites compared to sites that were protected
from burning (Reed 1997). Distinctive arthropod spe-
cies and groups were supported by the changing suc-
cession stages following fire. In general, landscapes
that have a range of sites representing different suc-
cessional stages and sites that have different burn
frequencies support the most species. However, on
individual sites that are burned at intervals, a cycle of
arthropod species richness, species composition, and
numbers of individuals occur. The combined effect of
fire frequency and time of burn on arthropod taxa were
reported for tropical savannas found in Australia
(Andersen and Muller 2000). A substantial resilience
to fire of the arthropod assemblages was found. Only
four of the 11 arthropod taxa were significantly af-
fected by fire. Ants, crickets, and beetles declined in
the absence of fire. Late season fires decreased spi-
ders, homopterans, silverfish, and caterpillars.
Some invertebrates have traits that allow them to
survive fire. These traits may arise in a variety of
ways. Some may not have evolved specifically as an
adaptation to fire, but rather more generally to hot
and arid conditions. For example, some invertebrates
have adaptations that enable them to conserve water
and resist high ambient temperatures in seasonally
dry habitats. Other groups of invertebrates possess
traits, such as high mobility, that appear to be charac-
teristic to particular taxonomic groups and not related
to specific ecosystems or fire regimes. Still other adap-
tations appear to have evolved primarily in response
to fire and can involve the complex long-term evolu-
tion of some rather esoteric anatomical features. For
example, a recent study on detailed morphological and
anatomical characteristics of a subfamily of beetles
(Coleoptera: Clerinae) suggests that these inverte-
brates evolved thermoreceptor antenna, which enable
the beetles to avoid death by fire in xeric environments
(Opitz 2003). The evolution of this feature occurred
over a span of tens of thousands of years.
The effects of fire on soil invertebrates have been
reviewed by several authors (DeBano and others 1998,
Lyon and others 2000a 2000b, Andersen and Müller
2000). Many of the reports cited describe inverte-
brates in savannas and other grasslands. These re-
ports indicate that the effects of fire on soil inverte-
brates can occur via several mechanisms (Andersen
and Müller 2000) that include direct mortality, through
forced emigration, or through the immigration of
pyrophilous species (such as wood-boring beetles that
are attracted by heat and smoke to a burned area
where they infest injured or dead trees). Short-term
indirect effects include modification of the habitat and
foraging sites, food supplies, microclimate, and rates
of predation. Long-term indirect effects are manifest
mainly in nutrient cycling and primary productivity.
Invertebrates residing more permanently in the
upper soil layers are most likely affected when these
soil layers are heated to lethal temperatures.
Macroinvertebrates dwelling exclusively in litter were
found to be particularly vulnerable to wildfire that
destroys surface fuels and litter (Sgardelis and others
1995). However, invertebrates that permanently oc-
cupy deeper soil horizons are usually protected from

USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
87
even high-severity fires. Some macroinvetebrates have
been found to move deeper into the soil during the
summer and, as a result, they are insulated from
lethal soil temperatures during fire. Most of the inver-
tebrates in the top 1.0 inch (2.5 cm) of soil survive
relatively cool burning wildfires or prescribed fires
(Coults 1945). A reduction in litter quantity after fire
can indirectly decrease both the number of inverte-
brate species and the species density of soil and litter
invertebrates as unprotected mineral soil warms
(Springett 1976).
The effect of soil heating on earthworms is not well
understood. One study in tallgrass prairie, however,
showed that the indirect effects of a fire are probably
more important than direct heating of earthworm
populations (James 1982). This study showed that fire
increased earthworm activity because of differences in
plant productivity following the fire. In general, the
subsurface soil horizons are usually proliferated with
roots and rhizomes, which in combination with more
favorable soil moisture conditions create an ideal
environment for earthworms at about 4 to 8 inches (10
to 20 cm) below the soil surface. A location this deep in
the soil most likely protects earthworms from the
direct effects of soil heating during fuel combustion,
except in the case of severe long-duration fires that
might occur under piles of slash and logs or in smolder-
ing duff and roots. Other studies have shown that fire
(in prairie grasslands and mixed forest types) fre-
quently leads to an increase in exotic earthworm
species at the expense of endemic species (Bhadauria
and others 2000, Callaham and others 2003).
Roots and Reproductive Structures
Many of the plant roots, vegetative reproductive
structures, and seeds are found immediately on the
surface of the soil or distributed downward through-
out the soil profile. These plant parts include tap roots,
fibrous surface roots, rhizomes, stolons, root crowns,
and bulbs. Many plant roots are found in the surface
organic layers (L-, F-, and H-layers) and can be di-
rectly affected whenever these layers are heated or
destroyed during a fire. Plant roots are sensitive to
both duration of heating and the magnitude of the
temperature reached. Temperatures of 140 ∞F (60 ∞C)
for 1 minute are sufficient to coagulate protein (Precht
and others 1973). Plant roots are sensitive to soil
heating, and lethal temperatures can occur before
proteins began to coagulate. The lethal temperature of
plant tissue is highly dependent on the moisture
content of the tissue. Those tissues containing higher
moisture contents tend to be killed at lower tempera-
tures and during a shorter interval of heating
(Zwolinski 1990). Miller (2000) gives additional infor-
mation on the effects of fire and soil heating on root
mortality and the welfare of vegetative reproduction.
Plant roots that are insulated by the soil have a
lower risk of being subjected to lethal temperatures
during a fire (DeBano and others 1998). The two most
important factors that insulate roots against soil heat-
ing are their depth in the soil and the soil water
content. Generally, the deeper the plant roots are
located in the soil, the greater will be the survival rate
(Flinn and Wein 1977). Low-severity fire that destroys
only the plant litter may kill only aboveground plant
parts. In contrast, high-severity fires can consume all
the surface organic matter and easily heat the mineral
soil above the lethal temperature for roots.
Seed banks that are stored in the soil can be affected
by fire. A majority of the seeds are stored in the litter
and upper part of the soil beneath the vegetative
canopy. Medium to high-severity fires heat the surface
layers sufficiently to destroy any seeds that have been
deposited. The lethal temperature for seeds is about
160 ∞F (70 ∞C) in wet soils and 190 ∞F (90 ∞C) in dry soils
(Martin and others 1975). Although fire can destroy
seeds, it also can enhance reproduction by seeds (Miller
2000). For example, fire can destroy allelopathic sub-
stances that inhibit seed production. Or, in the case of
ponderosa pine regeneration, fire can provide a min-
eral seedbed required for germination and growth.
The heating associated with fires may also stimulate
the germination of seeds that lie dormant in the soil for
years because of impermeable seed coats (such as
seeds of chamise, hoaryleaf ceanothus).
Soil heating, heat transfer, and the effect of the
lethal temperatures on the welfare of seeds and roots
are more complicated in moist soils than when the soil
is dry. Dry soil is a poor conductor of heat and, as a
result, heat does not penetrate deeply in the soil,
particularly if the residence time of the flaming front
is short. The surface of dry soil can easily exceed the
lethal temperature of living tissue of roots, while
ambient daily soil temperatures can prevail 0.8 inch
(2 cm) downward in the soil, with little damage occur-
ring to the roots. Therefore, when the roots are in dry
soil below 0.8 inch (2 cm), they are not likely to be
damaged by soil heating unless the residence time of
the flaming front is long. Conversely, those plant
structures on or near the soil surface can easily be
damaged. Also, the presence of moisture in the soil
affects plant root and seed mortality (in other words,
living biomass is killed at lower temperatures when
the soil is wet compared to a dry soil).
Amphibians, Reptiles, and Small
Mammals
The ability of amphibians, reptiles, and small
mammals to survive wildland fires depends on their
mobility and the uniformity, severity, size, and du-
ration of any fire (Wright and Bailey 1982). Fire can
cause direct injury and kill the animals themselves

88
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
depending on how capable they are of avoiding and
escaping the fire itself (Lyon and others 2000a). The
effects of wildland fires on these animal populations
can be found in a separate volume of this series (Smith
2000). Fire also affects the long-term welfare of these
larger animals by changing their habitat (Lyon and
others 2000b).
Biologically Mediated Processes
A wide range of microorganisms participate in cy-
cling carbon and plant nutrients in a systematic and
sustainable rate that is necessary for maintaining
healthy ecosystems. Important biologically regulated
processes carried out by these microbes that can be
affected by fire include decomposition, mineraliza-
tion, ammonification, nitrification, nitrogen-fixation,
and denitrification.
Decomposition—Fire affects decomposition in two
general ways (DeBano and others 1998). First, moder-
ate- and high-severity fires kill the biological organ-
isms that decompose organic matter (see the earlier
discussions on microorganisms). The microorganisms
most affected by fire include bacteria and fungi,
which are numerically the most abundant organisms
in terrestrial ecosystems and are the primary decom-
posers of organic matter in soil (Van Veen and
Kuikman 1990). Second, a rapid, strictly chemical
combustion process replaces the slower, biologically
mediated decomposition processes that occur under
nonfire conditions.
Nitrogen Mineralization—Two important min-
eralization process affected by fire are ammonification
and nitrification. The sensitivity of both ammonifying
and nitrifying bacteria to soil heating most likely plays
an important role in the nutrition of plants because N
is frequently limiting in wildland soils (DeBano and
others 1998). This relationship has been demonstrated
in unburned chaparral stands where high levels of
total N can occur as organic N, but only relatively low
levels of inorganic mineral N (NH4- and NO3-N) have
been measured. It has been hypothesized that the low
rate of mineralization in chaparral soils occurred be-
cause heterotrophic microorganisms responsible for
mineralization were inhibited by allelopathic sub-
stances present, or because high lignin contents of
chaparral plant leaves resist decomposition and sub-
sequent mineralization of N (Christensen 1973). The
hypothesis that higher concentrations of NH4- and
NO3-N are generally present after a fire is based on the
idea that NH4- and NO3-N are formed by different
processes as a result of burning (Christensen and
Mueller 1975, DeBano and others 1979). According to
this hypothesis, relatively large amounts of NH4-N are
produced chemically by soil heating during a fire (see
chapter 3) as well as being microbially produced
following a fire. Nitrogen in the form of NO3, however,
is not produced directly by heating during a fire, but
instead is formed during subsequent nitrification of
excess NH4-N produced as a result of burning. This
process is further complicated by the observation that
postfire nitrification does not appear to be carried out
by the classical nitrifying bacteria (for example,
Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter) because these bacteria
are particularly sensitive to soil heating and other
disturbances and, as a result, are absent (or at ex-
tremely low levels) for several months following burn-
ing (Dunn and others 1979). The absence of nitrifying
bacteria after fire suggests that nitrification may be
carried out by heterotrophic fungi. Dormant forms of
heterotrophic fungi have been reported to be stimu-
lated by mild heat treatments (Dunn and others 1985)
and are thought to have contributed to the fungal
growth that paralleled NO3 production (Dunn and
others 1979). Suppression of mineralization rates by
allelopathic substances has been further substanti-
ated by other studies in ponderosa pine forests in New
Mexico (White 1991, 1986) and in pinyon-juniper wood-
lands (Everett and others. 1995).
Studies have shown that both Nitrosomonas and
Nitrobacter are sensitive to soil heating during fire
such as occurs with microorganisms described earlier
(table 4.1). Studies in chaparral soils have shown that
Nitrosomonas bacteria are killed in dry soil at tem-
peratures of 250 to 280 ∞F (120 to 140 ∞C) as contrasted
to a moist soil where the lethal temperature is between
165 and 175 ∞F (75 and 80 ∞C) (Dunn and DeBano 1977,
Dunn and others 1985). Nitrobacter bacteria are even
more sensitive and are killed at 212 ∞F (100 ∞C) in dry
soil and at 120 ∞F (50 ∞C) in a moist soil. Unlike
heterotrophs, which must adapt to decreased organic
matter availability, nitrifiers are provided with a
sharp increase in available substrate (NH4) after fire
(Raison 1979). Consequently, the initial nitrifying
bacterial population decline due to soil heating typi-
cally is reversed within the first year in response to the
“flush” of available substrate (Jurgensen and others
1981, Acea and Carballas 1996).
Unfortunately, the increases in NH4- and NO3-N
following a fire are relatively short-lived and can
return to prefire levels within 2 years after burning
(DeBano and others 1998). Studies conducted after
burning tropical forests in Costa Rica showed that the
increase in available N returned to background levels
in 6 months (Matson and others 1987). Likewise, the
increased NH4-N produced during a fire in an Arizona
chaparral ecosystem remained at an elevated level for
about 6 months and then began decreasing, at which
time NO3-N began increasing (see fig. 3.6). Within a
year, both NH4- and NO3-N levels returned to prefire
levels. In another study, N mineralization increased
and remained elevated for 1 year in Agropyron spicatum

USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
89
and Stipa comata grasslands for 2 years following
prescribed burning in mountain shrublands (Hobbs
and Schimel 1984).
Nitrogen-Fixation—The effect of fire on N-fixa-
tion involves the effect of heating on the living proto-
plasm present in symbiotic and nonsymbiotic microor-
ganisms that fix N. Symbiotic N-fixing microorganisms
can be affected in at least two ways. First, the destruc-
tion of the host plant during combustion affects the
symbiotic relationship by removing the source of en-
ergy. Second, the symbiotic microorganisms present
in the roots may be killed if the upper organic layers
are consumed during a high-severity fire. Conversely,
little or no direct damage would be expected in the case
of deeper roots, which are far removed from the soil
surface, or during a cooler burning prescribed fire
(DeBano and others 1998). Nonsymbiotic bacteria
respond similarly to other microbes discussed earlier.
On the other hand, nonsymbiotic processes, which
receive energy from the biological oxidation of organic
matter, also have been reported to fix substantial
amounts of N. For example, more than one-third of the
N-fixing capacity of forest soils has been reported to be
provided by microorganisms responsible for decaying
wood on the surface and in the soil profile (Harvey and
others 1989). The management of woody residues
(coarse woody debris) within a fire prescription thus
becomes an important consideration in forest manage-
ment. Therefore, it is important to retain a substantial
amount of large woody debris on forest sites after
timber harvesting or when using prescribed fire. For
example, the amounts of residual woody debris recom-
mended in figure 4.9 are considered necessary for
maintaining the productivity of forests in Arizona,
Idaho, and Montana.
The indirect effect of fire on N-fixation focuses on the
role that both symbiotic and nonsymbiotic organisms
play in N-fixation and replenishment in wildland
ecoystems (DeBano and others 1998). Currently this
role is still under debate. For example, the results
reported from a study in forests of the Northwestern
United States showed that soil N-additions by symbi-
otic N-fixation were not as large as previously as-
sumed for these ecosystems (Harvey and others 1989).
However, some vegetation types, such as alder trees in
riparian ecosystems and dense stands of snowbrush
(Ceanothus velutinus), have been reported to fix sub-
stantial amounts of N (Jurgensen and others 1979).
The fixation of N in these forest and brushland areas
is by symbiosis.
Burning may create a favorable environment for the
establishment of N-fixing plants in some plant commu-
nities that are subjected to frequent fire. For example,
fire exclusion in ponderosa pine-Douglas fir forests in
the Northwest has been reported to lead to such wide-
spread changes in forest structure, composition, and
functioning that N-fixing plants species have been
reduced (Newland and DeLuca 2000).
Denitrification—Little research has been done on
the biological losses of N in relation to fire, partly
because of the overwhelming losses that occur chemi-
cally by volatilization (DeBano and others 1998). Deni-
trification, however, can be an important factor when
using fire in wetlands (see chapter 8).
Management Implications
Rarely are microorganisms and their processes more
than a passing thought in forest management plans.
For example, fuel-reduction programs rarely consider
the potential effects of surface fire on soil organisms
such as mycorrhizal fungi or autotrophic bacteria
(W. Johnson, personal communication). A recent
survey and management policy developed for protect-
ing a small percentage of the fungi and lichen within
the critical range of the northern spotted owl is the
exception to the rule (Molina and others 1999). This
situation is not surprising for at least two reasons.
First, most microorganisms are invisible to the naked
eye and are thus “out of sight” and, as a result, “out of
mind.” Second, no simple, inexpensive field test is
available to measure microbial populations or their
processes. Thus, managers have no practical means of
determining microbial responses to operational pre-
scribed burns. In addition, the results published from
fire effects studies have not always presented a clear
picture of how microorganisms respond to fire, thus
leaving managers guessing at how responsive micro-
organisms are (or wondering whether they should
care) for given forest types and anticipated fire severi-
ties.
However, the following general concepts of micro-
bial responsiveness to fire can be gleaned from past
studies:
•
Microorganisms are skilled at recolonizing
disturbed forests. Their resiliency is a func-
tion of unsurpassed physiological and genetic
diversity.
•
Fire effects are greatest in the forest floor and
decline rapidly with mineral soil depth. Recov-
ery of microbial populations in the forest floor
is not guaranteed, particularly in dry systems
with slow reaccumulation of organic material.
•
Severe wildfire and prescribed fire reduce or-
ganic matter content and increase the poten-
tial for loss of soil by erosion.
•
Prescriptions that avoid drastic changes in
the environmental factors controlling micro-
bial life—soil temperature, moisture, and sub-
strate availability—will be the most success-
ful at meeting operational objectives while
ensuring a functioning soil biotic community.

•
Knowledge gaps persist, particularly regarding
repeated fire and its effect on microorganisms.
Based on the above concepts, the following recommen-
dations are offered:
•
Minimize loss of forest floor (litter and duff).
Microorganisms are most vulnerable to heat
damage and habitat changes in this layer.
This presents a quandary for prescribed fire
practioners: How much organic material (fuel)
should be removed to reduce wildfire danger
while still maintaining an adequate supply
for forest function? Tiedemann and others
(2000) recommend burning when the upper
layer of the forest floor is dry enough to carry
fire and the lower layers are wet enough to
avoid consumption. Further, they recommend
extending the recovery time between repeated
fires if these conditions are not achieved or if
exposure of mineral soil is desired for tree
regeneration.
•
Avoid burning when soil is moist if the antici-
pated fire severity is high. Mortality of micro-
organisms is greater in moist soil than in dry
soil at high temperatures.
•
Provide adequate inoculum for microbial
recolonization by burning with mosaic patterns
(there is no assurance that indigenous popula-
tions will survive soil heating).
•
Supplement burning with other silvicultural
practices (partial harvest, crushing, mulch-
ing) to reduce fuel buildup. Repeated burning
of the forest floor can result in detrimental
effects to microbial biomass and activity.
Summary ______________________
Soil microorganisms are complex. Community mem-
bers range in activity from those merely trying to
survive to others responsible for biochemical reactions
that are among the most elegant and intricate known.
How microorganisms respond to fire will depend on
numerous factors, including fire intensity and sever-
ity, site characteristics, and preburn community com-
position. Some generalities can be made, however.
First, most studies have shown strong resilience by
microbial communities to fire. Recolonization to
preburn levels is common, with the amount of time
required for recovery generally varying in proportion
to fire severity. Second, the effect of fire is greatest in
the forest floor (litter and duff). We recommend pre-
scriptions that consume major fuels but protect forest
floor, humus layers, and soil humus.

Introduction ____________________
Effects of fire on the hydrologic cycle are determined
largely by the severity of the fire, decisions made
relative to any suppression activities, and the immedi-
ate postfire precipitation regime. Because informa-
tion is typically scarce for portions of the spectrum of
conditions in which a fire might occur, it is not possible
to adequately describe the possible impacts of fire in
all conceivable situations. But by understanding the
nature of the hydrologic processes impacted, we can
interpret the impact of fire on these processes at least
to the degree needed to make adequate management
decisions.
This chapter covers the hydrologic processes repre-
sented by the components of the hydrologic cycle
(Brooks and others 2003). We review how changes in
hydrologic processes that are brought about by, or
attributed to, the occurrence of fire, can translate into
changes in streamflow regimes.

pathways by which water is circulated from land and
water bodies to the atmosphere and back again. While
the hydrologic cycle is complex in nature and dynamic
in its functioning, it can be simplified as a system of
water-storage components and the solid, liquid, or
gaseous flows of water within and between storage
points (fig. B.1). Precipitation inputs (rain, snow, sleet,
and so forth) to a watershed are affected little by
burning. However, interception, infiltration, evapo-
transpiration, soil moisture storage, and the overland
flow of water can be significantly affected by fire. It
must be kept in mind that these components of the
hydrologic cycle are closely interrelated, and there-
fore, it is difficult in practice to isolate the impacts of
fire on one component alone.
A generalized percentage breakdown of water in-
puts, fluxes, and outputs in undisturbed forested wa-
tersheds is shown in figure B.2 (Hewlett 1982). These

movements of water can change somewhat in shrub
and grassland ecosystems and are altered in water-
sheds disturbed by harvesting (fig. B.3), burning,
insect defoliation, windthrow, land-use conversions,
mining, agriculture, and so forth. Precipitation inputs
consist of rain, snow, sleet, and so forth. Fluxes, or
movement pathways within a watershed, consist of
interception, stemflow, throughfall, infiltration, sur-
face runoff, interflow, baseflow, and stormflow.
Interception
Interception is the hydrologic process by which veg-
etative canopies and accumulations of litter and other
decomposed organic matter on the soil surface inter-
rupt the fall of precipitation from the atmosphere to
the soil surface. Interception plays a hydrologic role
of protecting the soil surface from the energy of
falling raindrops. Without this dissipation of en-
ergy, the mineral soil surface can become compacted
or dislodged by raindrop splash, which then impacts
the infiltration characteristics of the soil surface
and the pathways of water to stream systems within
a watershed.
Much of the precipitation that is intercepted returns
to the atmosphere by evaporation and, therefore, be-
comes a loss of water from the soil surface. As a
consequence, interception is a storage term that is
subtracted from the gross precipitation input to a
watershed in water budget studies. However, not all of
the precipitation intercepted by a vegetative canopy or
litter layer is returned to the atmosphere. Some of the
water intercepted by a vegetative canopy drips off the
foliage (throughfall) or flows down the stems of trees
to the soil surface (stemflow). This is especially the
case with the occurrence of large storms of long
duration (Brooks and others 2003). A portion of the
water that is intercepted by litter layers also drains to
the soil surface.
There is considerable variability in the magnitude of
rainfall interception by vegetative canopies. Intercep-
tion losses in temperate forests of North America
range from 0.05 to 0.26 inch (13 to 66 mm) in indi-
vidual storm events (Helvey 1971, Luce 1995). This
amounts to less than 5 to more than 35 percent of the
annual rainfall input to a watershed (Aldon 1960,
Rothacher 1963, Helvey and Patric 1965, Fuhrer 1981,
Roth and Chang 1981, Plamondon and others 1984).
Interception losses in the sparsely stocked woodlands,
shrublands, and grasslands of arid and semiarid re-
gions are typically less than 10 percent of the annual
rainfall (Skau 1964a, Tromble 1983, Haworth and
McPherson 1991). Brooks and others (2003) discuss
formulas used to calculate rainfall interception. Re-
gardless of the region, however, interception of rain-
fall represents a transient form of water storage in the
vegetative cover of a watershed.
Interception of snowfall is more difficult to quantify
than the interception of rainfall, largely because nei-
ther the initial amount of snowfall nor the amount of
water in the snow that accumulates on foliage of
vegetative canopies can be measured adequately. In
many situations, much of the intercepted snow is
ultimately deposited in the snowpack accumulating
on the ground through wind erosion and snowmelt,
with subsequent dripping and freezing in the snow-
pack on the ground (Miller 1966, Hoover and Leaf
1967, Satterlund and Haupt 1970, Tennyson and
others 1974).
Interception of either rain or snow by vegetative
canopies is largely a function of:
•
The form (rain or snow), intensity, and dura-
tion of the precipitation event.
•
The wind velocity, water vapor gradient away
from intercepting surfaces, and other storm
characteristics.
•
The type of vegetation (broad- or needle-
leaved), number of vegetative layers in the
canopy, and amount of surface leaf area.
Throughfall is precipitation that falls through a
plant canopy and lands on bare soil or litter. Intercep-
tion of throughfall precipitation by litter and other
decomposed organic matter on the soil surface ranges
from 5 to 35 percent of the gross precipitation input to
a watershed (Brooks and others 2003). Storage of
intercepted water in litter layers can represent a
relatively large proportion of small 1 inch (25 mm) and
less rainfall events. It can amount to 0.08 inch (2 mm)
on trees, 0.04 inch (1 mm) on shrubs, and 0.12 inch (3
mm) on litter. Interception and the storage of water in
litter on the soil surface are related to the depth,

density, and relative stage of the development of the
layers.
One obvious hydrologic consequence of fire destroy-
ing vegetative canopies, reducing litter accumula-
tions, or both is its consequent effects on interception
losses. It is one of the largest changes in hydrologic
response to short-duration, high-intensity summer
rain storms brought about by fire. Most of the vegeta-
tive canopy and litter is completely lost in severe
wildfires, and as a result, comparatively little postfire
interception of precipitation occurs (Bond and van
Wilgen 1996, Pyne and others 1996, DeBano and
others 1998). The effect of fire on interception in this
case is a likely increase in the amount of net precipita-
tion reaching the soil surface—that is, the amount of
throughfall. When only small quantities of a vegeta-
tive cover or litter are consumed in a fire of low
severity, the effect of fire on the interception process is
less pronounced. Persistence of prefire levels of litter
and other decomposed organic matter is important in
protecting the soil surface in those situations where
vegetation is destroyed by fire. Increased soil loss
through erosive processes is often a consequence when
large quantities of both protective layers (vegetation
and litter) are lost to fire.
Infiltration
Precipitation that reaches the soil surface moves
into the soil mantle, forms puddles of water on the soil
surface, or flows over the soil surface. The process of
water entering the soil is infiltration. The maximum
rate at which water can enter the soil is the infiltration
capacity. Water that infiltrates into the soil either
moves slowly downward and laterally to a stream
channel by interflow or downward still farther to a
groundwater aquifer. When more water is supplied to
a site than can infiltrate, the excess waterflows off the
surface, by the process of overland flow or surface
runoff, to a stream channel.
The relative proportion of the net precipitation that
infiltrates into the soil and moves to a stream channel
or percolates through the soil to the groundwater
aquifer largely determines the amount and timing of
streamflow that ultimately occurs on a watershed.
Infiltrometer measurements indicate that undisturbed
forest soils have high infiltration capacities compared
to other types of soil (Meeuwig 1971, Johnson 1978,
Johnson and Beschta 1980, Sidle and Drlica 1981).
This high rate of infiltration is a major factor contrib-
uting to the popularly held idea that forests have a
moderating effect on streamflow regimes.
Forest soils are generally porous and open on the
surface because of the accumulations of organic mat-
ter on the soil surface, the relatively high organic
content of forest soils, and the large number of
macropores that typically occur as a result of earth-
worm, insect, and other burrowing animal activities.
Infiltration into forest soils in more humid temperate
regions is generally higher than that observed in the
soils of arid and semiarid regions because of their more
permeable structure and the greater stability of aggre-
gates (Hewlett and Troendle 1975). Infiltration ca-
pacities of the soils in arid and semiarid regions are
often higher on sites dominated by tree species than on
shrub or grass-dominated sites (table B.1). Regardless
of region, however, variables affecting the infiltration
component include:
•
The soil texture, structure, porosity, and so
forth.
•
The accumulations of litter and other decom-
posed organic matter on the soil surface.
•
The composition and structure of the vegeta-
tive cover.
•
The land use and resultant vegetative changes,
which influence infiltration capacities prima-
rily by altering soil water storage.
•
Precipitation rate versus infiltration rate.
The latter factor is an important one to consider in
the interior Western United States and parts of the
South. Typical summer severe thunderstorms often
have high, short-duration rainfall bursts (for example,
10 to 15 minute downpours at the rate of 2 inches/hour

(50 mm/hr). These rainfalls are often confined to 250
to 500 acres (1 to 2 km2) (Neary 2002).
Infiltration properties of soils are often altered when
fire destroys vegetation and litter covers on a water-
shed (Pyne and others 1996, DeBano and others 1998,
Brooks and others 2003). When the burning has been
severe enough to exposes bare soil, infiltration can be
reduced due to:
•
A collapse of the soil structure and a subse-
quent increase in bulk density of the soil
because of the removal of organic matter,
which serves as a binding material.
•
The consequent reduction is soil porosity.
•
Impacts of raindrops on the soil surface caus-
ing compaction and a further loss of soil poros-
ity.
•
The kinetic forces of raindrop impact displac-
ing surface soil particles and causing a sealing
of surface pores.
•
Ash and charcoal residues clogging soil pores.
Variables that affect both the infiltration capacity
and cumulative infiltration into the soil can be af-
fected by fire to varying degrees, often resulting in
decreased infiltration (Zwolinski 1971, Biswell 1973,
MaNabb and others 1989), increased overland flow
(DeBano and others 1998, Brooks and others 2003),
and, ultimately, increased streamflow discharge. Rates
of infiltration are a function of a number of factors such
as soil texture, vegetation and litter cover, and soil
porosity. Infiltration rates with litter present can
often exceed rainfall intensities greater than 6.3 inches/
hour (greater than 160 mm/hr). Infiltration decreases
when soil particle sizes and cover are reduced. Rainfall
infiltration rates less than1 inch/hour (less than 25
mm/hr) in bare sands become less than 0.2 inch/hour
(less than 5 mm/hr) in clay-textured soils. The vari-
ables that influence infiltration include:
•
The vegetative cover type.
•
The portion of soil surface covered by litter
accumulations and other decomposed organic
matter.
•
The weight (depth) of the litter and other
organic material.
•
The soil texture, structure, porosity, bulk den-
sity, and so forth.
Another soil property that influences the infiltra-
tion process is the wettability of the soil (see chapter 2).
Soils in some vegetative types and regions can develop
a characteristic of water repellency following the oc-
currence of a fire, which (in turn) can reduce infiltra-
tion capacities. Although the presence of these hydro-
phobic soils is frequent in these situations, the causes
of this condition are not always well known (DeBano
1981 2000a,b, DeBano and others 1998). Most
hydrophobic soils repel water as a result of organic,
long-chained hydrocarbon substances coating the soil
particles. As a consequence, water “beads up” on the
soil surface and will not readily penetrate the surface
(see fig. 2.8 and 2.9), resulting in a change in infiltra-
tion. With this condition, accelerated overland flow
and increased surface erosion can occur, especially on
steeper slopes.
Hydrophobic soils are typically found in the chapar-
ral shrublands (comprising Quercus turbinella and
other sclerophyllous species) of southern California.
However, hydrophobic soils can be found after fires in
other vegetation types. Fires that occur frequently in
the chaparral region intensify the hydrophobic condi-
tion and, apparently, volatilize organic substances
that accumulate in the litter layer in the interval
between fires (DeBano 1981, Dunn and others 1988,
DeBano and others 1998). The resulting water repel-
lent layer is then driven deeper into the soil profile.
This layering arrangement allows rainfall to infiltrate
to only a limited depth before the wetting front reaches
the water repellent layer, often causing concurrent
increases in the amount of overland waterflow. The
soil layer above this water repellent layer is also easily
eroded and, therefore, affects sedimentation and de-
bris flow production after fire.
A fire can also influence the microclimate of a site by
causing greater air and soil temperature extremes
(Fowler and Helvey 1978, Pyne and others 1996,
DeBano and others 1998, Brooks and others 2003). In
cooler temperate regions, these temperature changes
can increase potentials for concrete-type soil frost to
form, which can then cause a reduction in infiltration
capacity that, therefore, is indirectly related to burn-
ing (Bullard 1954).
Evapotranspiration
Evaporation from soils, plant surfaces, and water
bodies, and water losses from transpiring plants, are
collectively the evapotranspiration component of the
hydrologic cycle. Part of the evapotranspiration com-
ponent is when vegetation canopies intercept precipi-
tation that is evaporating from plant foliage. Evapo-
transpiration is often a high percentage of the
precipitation in a water budget, approaching 100 per-
cent on some forested watersheds.
The evapotranspiration component of the hydro-
logic cycle interests hydrologists and watershed man-
agers because its magnitude largely determines the
proportion of the total precipitation input to a water-
shed that is likely to eventually become streamflow or
result in groundwater recharge. Evapotranspiration
also represents the component of the hydrologic cycle
that is influenced the most by vegetative changes on a
watershed that are brought about by planned and

100
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
unplanned land management activities. The evapo-
transpiration process largely controls the hydrologic
response of a watershed to rainfall and snowmelt
events; nevertheless, hydrologists and watershed
managers still understand little about the process
itself or the feedback mechanisms that control the
evapotranspiration process in natural environments
(Morton 1990, Ffolliott and Brooks 1996, Brooks and
others 2003). It is known, however, that the composi-
tion, density, and structure of vegetation influence
transpiration losses through time. Differences in the
transpiration rates among plant communities and
individual plant species on a watershed are attributed
largely to:
•
Differences in rooting characteristics
•
Stomatal response
•
Albedo of leaf surfaces
•
The length of the growing season
Estimated evapotranspiration values in the temper-
ate forests of North America range from 40 to over 85
percent of the annual precipitation. However, these
estimates of evapotranspiration vary greatly with
different compositions and structures of forest over-
stories (Croft and Monninger 1953, Brown and Th-
ompson 1965, Johnson 1970). On a watershed-scale, it
has been estimated that 80 to 95 percent of the annual
precipitation is evaporated from land surfaces or tran-
spired by plants on the forested watersheds in the
Southwestern United States, leaving only 5 to 20
percent available for runoff (Ffolliott and Thorud
1977). By contrast, runoff approaches 50 percent of the
rainfall, and there are larger snowmelt inputs on the
higher mountain watersheds of the Western United
States; nevertheless, the evapotranspiration compo-
nent is still large and potentially subject to modifica-
tion.
Evapotranspiration represents the largest loss of
water in terms of the components of the hydrologic
cycle. This is a problem in arid and semiarid regions
because of low precipitation (Pillsbury and others
1963, Skau 1964b, Branson and others 1976). In tropi-
cal areas, evapotranspiration is high but so is rainfall.
In some situations, soil water storage following the
end of the growing season in these harsh environ-
ments is nil, regardless of the type of vegetative cover,
indicating that large quantities of precipitation are
lost through the evapotranspiration process.
Watershed management studies throughout the
world have demonstrated that streamflow can in-
crease following vegetative changes that reduce evapo-
transpiration losses (Bosch and Hewlett 1982, Troendle
and King 1985, Hornbeck and others 1993, Whitehead
and Robinson 1993). That is, following a vegetative
change, less precipitation is converted into vapor
through the evapotranspiration process, and as a
consequence, more water is available for streamflow.
Vegetation-modifying or vegetation-replacing fire,
therefore, can change evapotranspiration (Bond and
van Wilgen 1996, Pyne and others 1996, DeBano and
others 1998). Fire that modifies the composition and
structure of the vegetation by removing foliar volume
will result in less evapotranspiration losses from a
watershed. Fire that causes a replacement of deep-
rooted, high profile trees or shrubs by shallow-rooted,
low profile grasses and forbs is also likely to reduce
evapotranspiration losses. In either instance, less
evapotranspiration loss following a fire often trans-
lates into increased streamflow.
Soil Water Storage
The maximum amount of water that a soil body
retains against the force of gravity is the field capacity
of the soil. When water is added to a soil that is already
charged to field capacity, the excess water either flows
overland to a stream channel or drains from the soil.
Soil is normally charged to, or near to, field capacity in
periods of high precipitation events and at the start of
the plant growing season. However, much of the water
that is stored in the soil is consumed by plants in
periods of sparse precipitation, and by the evapotrans-
piration process as the growing season progresses.
The soil water deficit occurring at the end of the
growing season is satisfied when high precipitation
amounts occur once again.
The amount of stored soil water that is lost to
evapotranspiration is largely a function of the vegeta-
tive type occupying the watershed site. Trees and
shrubs have roots that can penetrate deep into the soil
and, as a consequence, are able to extract water
throughout much of the soil body. On the other hand,
grasses, grasslike plants, and forbs have relatively
shallow root systems and are only able to use water in
the upper foot or so of the soil mantle. Water that
infiltrates into the soil surface is stored in the upper
layers of the soil profile, percolates through the soil
body, or both. Vegetative change has a lesser effect on
subsoil properties that influence soil water storage
than on those properties impacting on infiltration. It
follows, therefore, that effects of vegetative change on
the subsurface soil properties that influence soil water
storage are not likely to be controlling factors in the
hydrologic cycle of a watershed (Brooks and others
2003). However, a vegetative change that affects both
the evapotranspiration and infiltration processes can
influence soil water storage.
The effects of fire on soil water storage result mostly
from the loss of vegetation by the burn, which lowers
the evapotranspiration losses (DeBano and others
1998, Brooks and others 2003). Lower evapotranspira-
tion losses (in turn) leave more water in the soil at the

USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
101
end of the growing season than would be present if the
vegetation had not been burned (Tiedemann and oth-
ers 1979, Wells and others 1979, DeBano and others
1998). Overland flows of water and, ultimately,
streamflow regimes become more responsive to subse-
quent precipitation events as a consequence of this
increased soil water storage. It is often likely that soil
water deficits on the burned sites at the end of the
growing season will return to prefire levels in time if
the vegetative cover also recovers to conditions that
characterized the watershed before burning.
Effects of fire on the water storage of rangeland soils
are more variable than those in forested soils. Some
investigators have reported that the soil water storage
is higher on burned sites, others have found lower soil
water storage on these sites, and still others observed
no change (Wells and others 1979). Varying severities
of fire are often cited as the reason for these differ-
ences. Increases in soil water content and pore pres-
sures can be similar to those observed after forest
harvesting (Sidle 1985).
Snow Accumulation and Melt Patterns
Much of this introduction to the water resource
section of this publication has focused on rainfall as
the form of precipitation. However, snowfall is also an
important form of precipitation input to watershed
lands in many regions. The snowpack melts that
accumulate at higher latitudes and higher elevations
are often a primary source of water to downstream
users. It is not surprising, therefore, that hydrologists
and watershed managers can be interested in snow
accumulation and melt patterns and the effects of
vegetative change on these patterns.
The total snow on a watershed at any point in time
throughout the winter is largely a function of the total
snowfall (Baker 1990, Satterlund and Adams 1992,
Brooks and others 2003). However, greater snow accu-
mulations tend to be found at higher elevations on a
watershed than at lower elevations because of the
generally greater snowfall and lower temperatures at
the higher elevations (Anderson and others 1976,
Harr 1976; Ffolliott and others 1989, Ffolliott and
Baker 2000). More snow accumulates and is retained
longer into the winter season on “cooler” than on
“warmer” sites because of lower solar radiation levels
impinging on the former sites. More snow also accu-
mulates in sparsely stocked forests than in more dense
forests, and additional snowfall is deposited in small
openings in a forest canopy because of increased tur-
bulence (Troendle 1983, Ffolliott and others 1989,
Brooks and others 2003) or through the reduction in
the amount of snow intercepted by the forest canopy
(Troendle and Meiman 1984, Satterlund and Adams
1992, Brooks and others 2003). Once snowmelt is
initiated in the spring, the rate of melt becomes more
rapid in the forest openings than under dense vegeta-
tive canopies because of greater levels of solar radia-
tion impinging on the open site. The main effect is due
to the reduction in snow pack interception in crowns
and subsequent sublimation rather than and “redis-
tribution” effect (Troendle and King 1985).
Fire affects snow accumulation and melt patterns
when the burn creates openings in formerly dense
vegetative canopies. Not only is the amount of snow-
fall interception decreased after a fire has destroyed
the canopies, but additional snowfall is frequently
deposited into the created openings due to the disrup-
tions in wind turbulence over the canopy surface
(Satterlund and Haupt 1970). The characteristics of
these openings are dependent on the severity of the
fire. A wildfire of high severity can destroy much of the
forest cover on a watershed, creating many large
openings in the process. However, only a few relatively
small openings are likely to be created by a low
severity fire that consumes only the surface fuels.
Charred trees and other black bodies protruding
from a snowpack after a fire can change the reflectivity
of the ground surface, inducing more surface heating
and earlier and more rapid rates of snowmelt. Earlier
snowmelt in the spring can also be attributed to a
reduced soil water deficit on a burned site. In other
words, not as much water is needed to satisfy a deficit,
and as a consequence, overland flow originating from
snowmelt starts earlier in the season. Such changes in
the timing of snowmelt can also alter the timing,
magnitude, and duration of the streamflow regimes.
Overland Flow
That portion of the net precipitation that flows off
the soil surface is overland flow, also called surface
runoff, which is a major contributor to many streamflow
systems and the main contributor to most intermit-
tent streams. This hydrologic process occurs when the
rainfall intensity or the rate of snowmelt exceeds the
infiltration capacity of a site. Overland flow is the
pathway that moves net precipitation most directly to
a stream channel and, in doing so, quickly produces
streamflow (the following section on Streamflow Re-
gimes discusses the pathways and process by which
excess precipitation becomes streamflow).
The relative contribution of overland flow to the
streamflow from a watershed is variable, depending
largely on how impervious the soil surface is. Overland
flow generally occurs on sites that are impervious,
locally saturated, or where the infiltration capacity
has been exceeded by the net precipitation or rate of
snowmelt (Satterlund and Adams 1992, Brooks and
others 2003). Some overland flow can be detained
enroute to a stream channel by the roughness of the

102
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
soil surface and, therefore, slowed its movement to
the channel. Influences that vegetation and the soil
exert on interception, evapotranspiration, infiltration
rates, and the soil moisture content ultimately affect
the magnitude of overland flow.
Overland flow is a comparatively large component to
streamflow hydrographs for highly impervious areas
such as urban landscapes, is typically insignificant for
forested watersheds with well-drained and deep soils,
but is a problem where soils are shallow, rocky, or fine
textured (such as high clay or silt content).
An increase in overland flow often results when a
fire decreases interception and infiltration rates. This
is a major factor in the observed increases in streamflow
and flood peakflows, particularly after high severity
wildfires. A high severity wildfire can consume all or
nearly all of the protective vegetative cover and litter
layer over extensive watershed areas, producing a
significant effect on the magnitude of overland flow
and, as discussed below, on streamflow from a water-
shed (Tiedemann and others 1979, Baker 1990, DeBano
and others 1998). Formation of hydrophobic soils fol-
lowing fire also reduces infiltration, increases over-
land flow, and speeds delivery of the overland flow to
stream channels (Hibbert and others 1974, Rice 1974,
Scott and Van Wyk 1990). Persistence of the increased
overland flow following fire relates to the rate at which
burned sites become revegetated. Prescribed burning
often has its greatest hydrologic influence on the
infiltration processes and, as a consequence, on the
potential for increased overland flow.
Baseflows and Springs
Baseflow is the streamflow between storm events
and originates from infiltrated rainfall or ground-
water flow. It can increase when the watershed condi-
tion is maintained and deep-rooted vegetation on the
watershed is harvested or otherwise cut, removed in
converting from one vegetation type to another, or
killed by fire, insects, or disease. However, baseflow is
likely to decrease when the watershed condition dete-
riorates as a consequence of the disturbance, and more
excess precipitation leaves a watershed as overland
flow. In extreme situations, perennial streams that
are sustained by baseflow become ephemeral.
Baseflows are important in maintaining perennial
flow through the year. They are critical for aquatic
species habitat and survival. Baseflows can increase if
watershed condition remains good (infiltration re-
mains adequate) and deep-rooted vegetation is cut
(harvesting), removed (species conversion), or killed
by fire, insects, disease, herbicides, and so forth. If
watershed condition deteriorates and more precipita-
tion leaves as surface runoff, baseflows will decrease.
In extreme conditions, perennial streams become
ephemeral. The effect on biota in aquatic ecosystems
then becomes devastating. Even in subtropical or
tropical areas, deterioration of watershed condition
can result in the loss of perennial baseflow and ulti-
mately in desertification.
Crouse (1961) reported increased baseflows from
burned watersheds on the San Dimas Experimental
Forest in southern California. While these watersheds
had been cleared of their chaparral shrubs and associ-
ated vegetation by burning, seeded to grass, and main-
tained in a grass cover to induce higher streamflow
discharges, the author and others (Dunn and others
1988, DeBano and others 1998) felt that the wildfire
had made a significant contribution to the increased
baseflow.
Berndt (1971) observed immediate increases in
baseflow following a wildfire on a 1,410 acre (564 ha)
watershed in eastern Washington. While the caus-
ative hydrologic mechanisms involved were unknown,
the removal of riparian (streambank) vegetation by
the fire also eliminated diurnal fluctuations of flow.
The increased baseflow persisted above prefire levels
for 3 years after the fire.
Pathways and Processes _________
Before considering how fire affects streamflow re-
gimes, however, it is useful to review the pathways
and processes of waterflow from a watershed’s hillslope
to a stream channel. Excess water represents that
portion of total precipitation that flows off the land
surface plus that which drains from the soil and,
therefore, is neither consumed by evapotranspiration
nor leaked into deep groundwater aquifers (table B.2).
Various pathways by which excess water eventually
becomes streamflow (Brooks and others 2003) include:
•
Interception of precipitation that falls directly
into a stream channel, a streamflow pathway
referred to as channel interception.
•
Overland flow (see previous discussion).
•
Subsurface flow that represents the part of
precipitation that infiltrates into the soil and
arrives at a stream channel in a short enough
period to be considered part of the stormflow
hydrograph. The stormflow components of a
hygrograph are the sum of channel intercep-
tion, overland flow, and subsurface flow.
•
A perennial stream that is fed by baseflow that
sustains streamflow between precipitation or
snowmelt events.
It is almost impossible to separate pathways of
waterflow in most investigations of streamflow re-
sponses to the effects of fire or other watershed distur-
bances (Dunne and Leopold 1978, Satterlund and
Adams 1992, DeBano and others 1998, Brooks and

USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005

others 2003). Responses of streamflow to fire are more
generally evaluated when possible and where appro-
priate by separating the stormflow component of the
hydrograph from the baseflow (when a baseflow is
present) and then studying the two flow components
separately (fig. B.4).
The Variable Source Area Concept (Hewlett and
Hibbert 1967) describes how the perennial channel
system expands during precipitation as areas at the
head and adjacent to perennial channels become satu-
rated during the event. Figure B.5 depicts the concept
of how a stream channel system expands during pre-
cipitation. It is important to understand this concept
in order to understand the hydrologic response of a
watershed and its component areas, particularly after
disturbances such as fire. Important hydrologic and
geomorphic processes (sediment transport, channel
scour and fill, streambank erosion, fish habitat dam-
age, riparian vegetation damage, nutrient transport,
woody debris transport and deposition, and so forth.)
occur during stormflows when water volumes and
velocities are at their highest. Low severity fires usu-
ally do not affect the flow pathways shown in figure
B.2, but severe fires shift more of the movement of
water to the “water not infiltrated” side of flow dia-
gram. The magnitude and duration of stormflow is a
function of the intensity and duration of precipitation
as well as a factor called watershed condition.
Watershed Condition
The timing, magnitude, and duration of a stormflow
response to fire are largely a function of the hydrologic
condition of the watershed. Watershed condition is a
term that describes the ability of a watershed system
to receive and process precipitation without ecosystem
or hydrologic degradation (Brooks and others 2003).

Rainfall infiltrates into the soil, and the baseflow of
perennial streams is sustained between storms when
a watershed is in good condition. In this situation,
rainfall does not contribute significantly to increased
erosion because most of the excess precipitation does
not flow over the soil surface where it can detach and
transport sediments.
A severe wildfire can alter the condition of a water-
shed, however, reducing it to a generally poorer state.
With poor watershed condition, the amount of infil-
trated rainfall is reduced significantly, more excess
precipitation then flows over the surface of the soil,
and there is little or no baseflow between storms.
Erosion rates are relatively higher because of the
excessive overland flow. Watersheds in arid or semi-
arid regions with rocky and thin soils almost always
function hydrologically in this manner because of
their inherent climate, soils, and vegetative features.
These watersheds are prone to damaging flash floods.
Watershed condition at a point in time is controlled
largely by the composition and density of the vegeta-
tive cover, the accumulations of litter and other or-
ganic material, and the amount of exposed rocks and
bare soils that characterizes the watershed. Because a
wildfire of high severity can destroy the vegetation
and litter layer on a watershed and alter the physical
properties of the soil, the infiltration and percolation
capacities of the soil are detrimentally impacted (see
chapter 2). In turn, these cumulative fire effects can
change the watershed condition from good to poor,
resulting in ever-increasing overland flow, erosion,
and soil loss. An analogy to this situation is a loss of
function in the human skin with increasing severity of
burning. As watershed condition deteriorates, the
inherent hydrologic processes become altered, increas-
ing the likelihood of adverse hydrologic responses to
fire. The change in infiltration rates going from “good”
(intact forest floor) to “poor” (bare soil plus water
repellency) is one example of this response.
Streamflow Discharge
The streamflow discharge for a specified time inter-
val (year, month, season, and so forth) is reflected by
stormflow, baseflow, or combinations of the two path-
ways. Stormflow results directly from a precipitation
or snowmelt event. When vegetation and organic mat-
ter on the soil surface are destroyed by fire, intercep-
tion and evapotranspiration are reduced, infiltration
is decreased, and overland flow and subsurface flow
can increase. In turn, increases in overland flow and
subsurface flow often translate into:
•
Increases in stormflow from the burned wa-
tershed.
•
Increases in baseflow if the stream is peren-
nial in its flow.
•
Increases in streamflow discharge as a conse-
quence of the increases in stormflow, baseflow,
or both.
Onsite fire effects must be determined initially, and
these effects can then be evaluated within the context
of the entire watershed to determine the responses of
streamflow discharge and, more generally, the other
changes in a streamflow regime to a fire. While deter-
mining the onsite effects of a fire can be relatively
straightforward through appropriate measurements
and evaluations, determining effects of fire on a water-
shed-scale is more difficult (Pyne and others 1996,
DeBano and others 1998). With the latter, combining
all processes and pathways of waterflow to the outlet
of the watershed, and routing this flow to downstream
points of interest or use, are necessary (Brooks and
others 2003). Concerning the streamflow discharge at
the outlet of a watershed, the effects of fire on the
timing can be diminished and the magnitude can be
lengthened as the postfire streamflow event moves
downstream.
Hydrologists and watershed managers, when study-
ing the effects of fire on the streamflow regime of a
watershed, are also concerned with the likelihood of
changes in timing of flow. Information on this topic is
limited, but some researchers note that streamflow
from burned watersheds often responds to rainfall
inputs faster than watersheds supporting a protective
vegetative cover, producing streamflow events where

time-to-peak is earlier (Campbell and others 1977,
DeBano and others 1998, Brooks and others 2003).
Earlier time-to-peak, coupled with higher peakflow,
can increase the frequency of flooding. Timing of
snowmelt in the spring can also be advanced by fire in
some instances. Early snowmelt can be initiated by
lower snow reflectivity (albedo) caused by blackened
trees and increased surface exposure where vegeta-
tive cover has been eliminated (Helvey 1973).
There is little doubt that wildfire often has an
influence on streamflow discharge, especially a wild-
fire of high severity. The combined effects of a loss of
vegetative cover, a decrease in the accumulations of
litter and other decomposed organic matter on the soil
surface, and the possible formation of water repellent
soils are among the causative mechanisms for the
increase in streamflow discharge (Tiedemann and
others 1979, Baker 1990, Pyne and others 1996, DeBano
and others 1998, Brooks and others 2003). While the
increases in streamflow discharge are highly variable,
they are generally greater in regions with higher
precipitation as illustrated by studies in the United
States and elsewhere (fig. B.3).
Water Quality ___________________
Increases in streamflow following a fire can result in
little to substantial impacts on the physical, chemical,
and biological quality of water in streams, rivers, and
lakes. The magnitude of these effects is largely depen-
dent on the size, intensity, and severity of the fire, the
condition of the watershed when rainfall starts, and
the intensity, duration, and total amount of rainfall.
Postfire streamflow can transport solid and dissolved
materials that adversely affect the quality of water for
human, agricultural, or industrial purposes. The most
obvious effects are produced by sediments. See chap-
ter 2 for more discussion on these components of water
quality, which in the following chapters on the water
resource are relative to information on municipal
water supply quality.
Water quality refers to the physical, chemical, and
biological characteristics of water relative to a particu-
lar use. Important characteristics of interest to hy-
drologists and watershed managers include sediment,
water temperature, and dissolved chemical constitu-
ents such as nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, magne-
sium, and potassium. Bacteriological quality is also
important if water is used for human consumption or
recreation; this is the case with many waters that are
both within, and that drain from, forested lands.
A water quality standard refers to the physical,
chemical, or biological characteristics of water in
relation to a specified use. Changes in water quality
due to a watershed management practice or natural
and human-caused disturbances can make the water
flowing from the watershed unsuitable for drinking.
However, it might still be acceptable for other uses. In
some instances, laws or regulations prevent water
quality characteristics from becoming degraded to the
point where a water quality standard is jeopardized
(DeBano and others 1998, Landsberg and Tiedemann
2000, Brooks and others 2003). The main purpose of
these laws and regulations is maintaining the quality
of water for a possible and maybe unforeseen future
use.
Hydrologists and watershed managers often con-
front the issue of whether forest or rangeland fires will
create conditions in natural or impounded waters that
are outside of the established water quality standards.
Water quality standards and criteria established by
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (1999)
are the “benchmarks” for water quality throughout
the United States. Water quality criteria are the
number or narrative benchmarks used to assess the
quality of water. Standards include criteria, beneficial
uses, and an antidegradation policy. The most adverse
effects from wildfires on water quality standards come
from physical effects of the sediment and ash that are
deposited into streams.
Several chemical constituents that are regulated by
water quality standards are likely to be impacted by
burning. Primary standards in the EPA regulations
cover nitrate-nitrogen, nitrite-nitrogen, and other sub-
stances that are not immediately associated with fire.
Secondary standards apply to pH, sulfate, total dis-
solved solids, chloride, iron, turbidity, and several
other constituents. Secondary standards are also set
for color and odor. Chapter 6 examines the water
quality standards that can be impacted, and in some
cases exceeded, by fire.
Changes in the hydrologic cycle caused by fires can
affect the rate of soil erosion, and the subsequent
transport and deposition of eroded soil as sediment into
streams, lakes, and reservoirs (DeBano and others
1998, Brooks and others 2003). Chapter 5 looks at fire-
produced alterations in the hydrologic cycle that in turn
affect soil erosion, sedimentation, and water quality.
Maintaining a vegetative cover or a cover of litter
and other organic material on the soil surface is the
best means of preventing excessive soil erosion rates.
However, fire can remove these protective covers and
accelerate soil erosion (Dunne and Leopold 1978,
Satterlund and Adams 1992, Brooks and others 2003).
Increased soil erosion is often the most viable effect of
a fire other than the loss of vegetation by burning.
Aquatic Biology _________________
Prior to the 1990s, little information existed on the
effects of wildfire on fishes, other aquatic organisms
such as macroinvertebrates, and their habitats.

106
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
Severson and Rinne (1988) reported that most of the
focus of postwildfire effects on riparian-stream ecosys-
tems has traditionally been on hydrological and ero-
sional responses. The Yellowstone Complex Fires in
1988 ushered in an extensive effort to examine both
the direct and indirect effects of wildfire on aquatic
ecosystems (Minshall and others 1989a, Minshall and
Brock 1991). Most of the information available on fire
effects on fishes and their habitats was generated in
the 1990s and on a regional basis. By the late 1990s,
state-of-knowledge papers on the topic of fire, aquatic
ecosystem, and fishes were drafted by Rieman and
Clayton (1997) and Gresswell (1999). These two pa-
pers suggest future research and management direc-
tion for both corroborating aquatics-fisheries and fire
management and conservation of native, sensitive
species. These papers are have become the base for
21st century fisheries and aquatic management rela-
tive to both wild and prescription fires. Chapter 7
addresses both the direct and indirect effects of wild-
land fires and associated suppression activities on
aquatic ecosystems.

Introduction ____________________
Forested watersheds are some of the most important
sources of water supply in the world. Maintenance of
good hydrologic condition is crucial to protecting the
quantity and quality of streamflow on these important
lands (fig. 5.1). The effects of all types of forest distur-
bance on storm peak flood flows are highly variable
and complex, producing some of the most profound
hydrologic impacts that forest managers have to con-
sider (Anderson and others 1976). Wildfire is the
forest disturbance that has the greatest potential to
change watershed condition (DeBano and others 1998).
Wildfires exert a tremendous influence on the hy-
drologic conditions of watersheds in many forest eco-
systems in the world depending on a fire’s severity,
duration, and frequency. Fire in these forested areas
is an important natural disturbance mechanism that
plays a role of variable significance depending on
climate, fire frequency, and geomorphic conditions.
This is particularly true in regions where frequent
fires, steep terrain, vegetation, and postfire seasonal

precipitation interact to produce dramatic impacts
(Swanson 1981, DeBano and others 1998, Neary and
others 1999).
Watershed condition, or the ability of a catchment
system to receive and process precipitation without
ecosystem degradation, is a good predictor of the
potential impacts of fire on water and other resources
(such as roads, recreation facilities, riparian vegeta-
tion, and so forth). The surface cover of a watershed
consists of the organic forest floor, vegetation, bare
soil, and rock. Disruption of the organic surface cover
and alteration of the mineral soil by wildfire can
produce changes in the hydrology of a watershed well
beyond the range of historic variability (DeBano and
others 1998). Low severity fires rarely produce ad-
verse effects on watershed condition. High severity
fires usually do (fig. 5.2). Most wildfires are a chaotic
mix of severities, but in parts of the world, high
severity is becoming a dominant feature of fires since
about 1990 (Neary and others 1999, Robichaud and
others 2000). Successful management of watersheds
in a postwildfire environment requires an understand-
ing of the changes in watershed condition and hydro-
logic responses induced by fire. Flood flows are the
largest hydrologic response and most damaging to
many resources (fig. 5.3, Neary 1995).
The objective of this chapter is to examine some of
the effects of fire on watershed hydrology.
Soil Water Storage ______________
The effects of fire on soil water storage can be
illustrated by a wildfire that occurred on a 1,410 acre
(564 ha) watershed in eastern Washington that effec-
tively changed the magnitude of the autumnal soil
water deficit on the watershed (Klock and Helvey
1976). The mixed conifer forest vegetation on this
watershed apparently depleted all of the available soil
water in the upper 48 inches (120 cm) of the soil profile
immediately before the August 1970 fire (fig. 5.4). The
difference between the soil water deficits from 1970 to
1971 was about 4.6 inches (116 mm), which (research-
ers concluded) contributed a significant part to the
increased streamflow discharge reported by Helvey
and others (1976). The transpiration draft of large
conifer trees had been removed by 1971, and the

observed soil water deficit was an apparent result of
surface evaporation and transpiration by the newly
established postfire vegetation. The increased autum-
nal soil water deficit in 1972 and 1974 was caused by
the greater evapotranspiration demand by increased
vegetative regrowth (Tiedemann and Klock 1976).
The trends for postfire years 1971 to 1974 suggest that
the minimum soil contents might reach prefire levels
in about 5 years after the wildfire.
This trend does not necessarily hold true in all
instances, however. For example, a reduction in water
storage was observed in the upper 12 inches (30 cm) of
the soil on a watershed in northern Arizona where the
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest had been
severely burned, in comparison to the soil storage of an
adjacent unburned watershed (Campbell and others
1977). Greater overland flow from the burned water-
shed was the factor underlying this difference. Water
repellency of the soil and the increased drying of the
more exposed soil surface contributed to this increased
flow.
Effects of fire on the water storage of rangeland
soils are more variable than those in forested soils.
Some investigators have reported that the soil water
storage is higher on burned sites, others have found
lower soil water storage on these sites, and still
others observed no change (Wells and others 1979).
Varying severities of fire are often cited as the reason
for these differences.
Baseflows and Springs___________
Wildfires in 1996 and 2000 resulted in a number of
anecdotal reports of springs beginning to flow after
years of being dry. This sort of response is common in
the Southwest and regions such as central Texas when
an area is cleared or burned (Thurow, personal com-
munication). Often trees such as juniper or live oak
have increased in density and size along with the onset
of effective fire control in the early 1900s. As trees
begin to dominate ecosystems such as fire-climax
grassland savannas, the trees alter the water balance
because they have substantially greater interception
loss and transpiration capacity. The local soils and
geology determine whether water yield occurs as spring
flow or groundwater recharge. The seasonal patterns
of the amount and timing precipitation and potential
evapotranspiration determine whether there is any
excess water to contribute to water yield. For example,
on arid sites all precipitation would be lost to evapo-
transpiration and thus essentially nothing would per-
colate fast enough beyond the root system, or evapo-
rate from the soil surface, to recharge springs or
aquifers. Some shrub sites may yield substantial
amounts of water, others may yield nothing (Wu and
others 2001).
On the Three Bar chaparral watersheds of the Tonto
National Forest in Arizona, watersheds that had no
flow or were intermittent responded to a wildfire
(Hibbert and others 1974). Watershed B yielded no
flow prior to the fire. It flowed continuously for 18
months, then was intermittent until treated with
herbicides when it returned to perennial flow for 10
plus years. Watershed D was dry 67 percent of the time
prior to the wildfire. Following the fire, it then re-
sumed continuous flow until brush regrew, when it
returned to intermittent flow. On the Whitespar Wa-
tersheds, Watershed B resumed perennial flow after
38 acres (15 ha) adjacent to the channel were treated
with herbicide. Similar responses have been found in
California chaparral (Crouse 1961). Treatment of the
Natural Drainages, Sierra Ancha, with herbicides did
not produce perennial flow but did increase the dura-
tion of intermittent flows. The soils at this site are
more shallow than those at Three Bar or Whitespar.
The key here is control of vegetation in deep-soil, arid
systems where transpiration from deep-rooted plants
can consume water that would otherwise become pe-
rennial streamflow. The response is quickly termi-
nated as deep-rooted, brush-chaparral trees regrow.
Perennial flow can only be maintained by converting
to (or back to) shallow-rooted herbaceous species.
Increases in any single year are affected by rainfall.
Often, 80 percent of the increased water yield over a
10-year period occurs in just a few wetter-than-aver-
age years, not every year.
Streamflow Regimes _____________
Annual streamflow totals (annual water yields)
generally increase as precipitation inputs to a water-
shed increase. Streamflows originating on forest wa-
tersheds, therefore, are generally greater than those
originating on grassland watersheds, and streamflows
from grasslands are greater than those originating
on desert watersheds. Furthermore, annual
streamflow totals frequently increase when mature
forests are harvested or otherwise cut, attacked by
insects, or burned (Bosch and Hewlett 1982, Troendle
and King 1985, Hornbeck and others 1993, White-
head and Robinson 1993). The observed increases in
streamflow following these disturbances often di-
minish with decreasing precipitation inputs to a
watershed (see fig. B.3).
Effects of Wildfires
Annual streamflow discharge from a 1,410 acre
(564 ha) watershed in the Cascade Range of eastern
Washington, on which a wildfire killed nearly 100
percent of the mixed conifer forest vegetation, in-
creased dramatically relative to a prefire streamflow

110

relationship between the watershed that was burned
and an unburned control (fig. 5.5). Differences be-
tween the measured and predicted streamflow dis-
charge varied from nearly 4.3 inches (107 mm) in a
dry year (1977) to about 19.1 inches (477 mm) in a wet
year (1972). Soil water storage remained high for the
period of record largely because of abnormally high
precipitation (rain and snow) inputs (Helvey 1980).
As a consequence, the burned and control watersheds
became more sensitive to precipitation.
Campbell and others (1977) observed a 3.5 times
increase of 0.8 inch (20 mm) in average annual
stormflow discharge from a small 20.2 acre (8.1 ha)
severely burned watershed following the occurrence of
a wildfire in a Southwestern ponderosa pine forest.
Average annual stormflow discharge from a smaller
10 acre (4 ha) moderately burned watershed increased
2.3 times to almost 0.6 inch (15 mm) in relation to an
unburned (control) watershed. Average runoff effi-
ciency-a term that refers to the percentage of runoff to
precipitation-increased from 0.8 percent on the un-
burned watershed to 3.6 and 2.8 percent on the se-
verely burned and moderately burned watersheds,
respectively. In comparison to the moderately burned
watershed, the average runoff efficiency on the se-
verely burned watershed was 357 percent greater
when the precipitation input was rain and 51 percent
less in snowmelt periods. The researchers speculated
that the observed differences during rainfall events
were largely due to the lower tree density, a greater
reduction in litter cover, and a more extensive formations
hydrophobic soil, resulting in lower evapotranspira-
tion losses and more stormflow on the severely burned
watershed than on the moderately burned watershed.
In the spring snowmelt period, the lower tree density
of the severely burned watershed allowed more of the
snowpack to be lost to evaporation. As a result, less
stormflow occurred than on the more shaded, moder-
ately burned watershed.
In the fire-prone interior chaparral shrublands of
the Southwestern United States, annual streamflow
discharge from their watersheds can increase by vary-
ing magnitudes, at least temporarily, as a result of
wildfires of high severity (Davis 1984, Hibbert 1984,
Baker and others 1998). The combined effects of loss of
vegetative cover, decreased litter accumulations, and
formation of water repellent soils following the burn-
ing are the presumed reasons for these streamflow
increases (Rundel 1977, Baker 1999).
In the first year after a 365 acre (146 ha) watershed
in southern France, near the Mediterranean Sea, was
burned over by a wildfire, streamflow discharge in-
creased 30 percent to nearly 2.4 inches (60 mm)
(Lavabre and others 1993). The prefire vegetation on
the watershed was primarily a mixture of maquis,
cork oak, and chestnut trees. The researchers attrib-
uted the increase in annual streamflow discharge to
the reduction in evapotranspiration due to the de-
struction of this vegetation by the fire.
Average annual streamflow discharge increased by
about 10 percent to 4.8 inches (120 mm) on a 612 acre
(245 ha) watershed in the Cape Region of South Africa
following a wildfire that consumed most of the indig-
enous fynbos (sclerophyllous) shrubs (Scott 1993).
This increase was related mostly to the reductions in
interception and evapotranspiration losses.
Effects of Prescribed Burning
Streamflow responses to prescribed fire (fig. 5.6) are
smaller in magnitude in contrast to the responses to
wildfire. It is generally not the purpose of prescribed
burning to completely consume extensive areas of
litter and other decomposed organic matter on the soil
surface (Ffolliott and others 1996, DeBano and others
1998) and, therefore, the drastic alterations in
streamflow discharges that are common after severe
wildfires do not normally occur. To illustrate this
point, the average annual streamflow discharge was
not changed relative to prefire levels in 6 years follow-
ing a prescribed fire on 43 percent of a 1,178 acre (471
ha) watershed in northern Arizona supporting a pon-
derosa pine forest (Gottfried and DeBano 1990). The

prescribed burning plan specifying a 70 percent reduc-
tion in fine fuels and a 40 percent reduction in heavy
fuels on the burned area was satisfactorily met, with
minimal damage to the residual stand of trees.
A burn that was prescribed to reduce the accumu-
lated fuel loads on a 450 acre (180 ha) watershed in the
Cape Region of South Africa resulted in a 15 percent
increase to 3.2 inches (80 mm) in average annual
streamflow discharge (Scott 1993). Most of the fynbos
shrubs that vegetated the watershed were not dam-
aged by the prescribed fire. The effectiveness of the
prescribed fire was less than anticipated because of
the unseasonably high rainfall amounts at the time of
burning.
A prescribed fire in a Texas grassland community
(fig. 5.4) resulted in a large increase (1,150 percent) in
streamflow discharge in comparison to an unburned
watershed in the first year after burning (Wright and
others 1982). The increased postfire streamflow dis-
charge was short lived, however, with streamflows
returning to prefire levels shortly after the burning.
Burning of logging residues (slash) in timber har-
vesting operations, burning of competing vegetation
to prepare a site for planting, and burning of forests
and woodlands in the process of clearing land for
agricultural production are common practices in many
parts of the United States and the world. Depending
on their intensity and extent, the burnings prescribed
for these purposes might cause changes in streamflow
discharge from the watersheds on which these treat-
ments are conducted. But, in analyzing the responses
of streamflow discharge to prescribed fire, it is difficult
to isolate effects of these burning treatments from the
accompanying hydrological impacts of timber har-
vesting operations, site preparation, and clearing of
forest vegetation.
Results of other studies on the changes in streamflow
discharge following either a wildfire or prescribed
burning are presented in tables 5.1 through 5.5. These
results are summarized on the basis of Bailey’s (1995)
ecoregion classifications for comparisons purposes.
Peakflows______________________
Peakflows are a special subset of streamflow re-
gimes that deserve considerable attention. The effects
of forest disturbance on storm peakflows are highly
variable and complex. They can produce some of the
most profound impacts that forest managers have to

consider. The magnitude of increased peakflow follow-
ing fire (table 5.6) is more variable than streamflow
discharges (tables 5.1 to 5.5) and is usually well out of
the range of responses produced by forest harvesting.
Increases in peakflow as a result of a high severity
wildfire are generally related to a variety of processes
including the occurrence of intense and short duration
rainfall events, slope steepness on burned watersheds,
and the formation of soil water repellency after burn-
ing (DeBano and others 1998, Brooks and others
2003). Postfire streamflow events with excessively
high peakflows are often characteristic of flooding
regimes
Peakflows are important events in channel forma-
tion, sediment transport, and sediment redistribution
in riverine systems (Rosgen 1996, Brooks and others
2003). These extreme events often lead to significant
changes in the hydrologic functioning of the stream
system and, at times, a devastating loss of cultural
resources. Peakflows are important considerations in
the design of structures (such as bridges, roads, dams,
levees, commercial and residential buildings, and so
forth). Fire has the potential to increase peakflows
well beyond the normal range of variability observed
in watersheds under fully vegetated conditions (table
5.6). For this reason, understanding of peakflow re-
sponse to fire is one of the most important aspects of
understanding the effects of fire on water resources.
Peakflow Mechanisms
A number of mechanisms occur singly or in combina-
tion to produce increased postfire peakflows (fig. 5.7).
These include obvious mechanisms such as unusual

USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
115
rainfall intensities, destruction of vegetation, reduc-
tions in litter accumulations and other decomposed
organic matter, alteration of soil physical properties,
and development of soil hydrophobicity.
A special circumstance sometimes occurs with
postwildfire peakflows that can contribute to the large
responses (up to three orders of magnitude increase).
Cascading debris dam failures have the potential to
produce much higher peakflow levels than would be
expected from given rainfall events on bare or water
repellent soils. This process consists of the establish-
ment of a series of debris dams from large woody debris
in and adjacent to stream channels, buildup of water
behind the dams, and sequential failure of the first
and subsequent downstream debris dams (fig. 5.8).
Concern about this process has led to the use of one
type of BAER channel treatment, debris removal.
Channels particularly prone to this process would
include those with large amounts of woody debris and
a high density of riparian trees or boulders, which
could act as the dam formation mechanism. After the
1991 Dude Fire in Arizona, Rinne (1994) reported that
little of the tagged prefire woody debris moved after a
significant postfire flood event. On the other hand,
some unusually high flood flows after the 2000
Cerro Grande Fire in New Mexico left distinct evi-
dence of woody debris dam formation and failure
(Kuyumjian, Gregpry A., USDA Forest Service, per-
sonal communication).
Fire Effects
Anderson and others (1976) provided a good review
of peakflow response to disturbance. These responses
are influenced by fire severity. Low severity pre-
scribed burning has little or no effect on peakflow
because it does not generally alter watershed condi-
tion.
Intense short duration storms that are character-
ized by high rainfall intensity and low volume have
been associated with high stream peakflows and sig-
nificant erosion events after fires (Neary and others
1999). In the Intermountain West, high intensity,
short duration rainfall is relatively common (Farmer
and Fletcher 1972). Five-minute rainfall rates of 8.38
to 9.25 inches/hour (213 and 235 mm/hour) have been
associated with peakflows from recently burned areas
that were increased five times that for adjacent, un-
burned areas (Croft and Marston 1950). A 15-minute
rainfall burst at a rate of 2.64 inches/hour (67 mm/
hour) after the 2000 Coon Creek Fire in Arizona
produced a peakflow that was in excess of sevenfold
greater than the previous peakflow during 40 years of
streamflow gauging. Moody and Martin (2001) re-
ported on a threshold for rainfall intensity (0.39 inch/
hour or 10 mm/hour in 30 minutes) above which flood
peakflows increase rapidly in the Rocky Mountains.
Robichaud (2002) collected rainfall intensity on 12
areas burned by wildfire in the Bitterroot Valley of
Montana. He measured precipitation intensities that
ranged from 3 to 15 mm in 10 minutes. The high end
of the range was an equivalent to 75 mm/hour (greater
than a 100-year return interval). It is these types of
extreme rainfall events, in association with altered
watershed condition, that produce large increases in
stream peakflows and erosion.
Peakflows after forest cutting can increase or de-
crease depending on location, the percentage of the
watershed cut, precipitation regime, and season (table
5.6, fig. B.3). Most studies show increases in peakflows
of 9 to 100 percent. The concern with increases in
annual flood peakflows is that the increases could lead

to channel instability and degradation, and to in-
creased property damage in flood-prone urban areas.
Fire has a range of effects on stream peakflows. Low
severity, prescribed fires have little or no effect be-
cause they do not substantially alter watershed condi-
tion (table 5.6). Severe wildfire has much larger effects
on peakflows. The Tillamook Burn in 1933 in Oregon
increased the total annual flow of two watersheds by
1.09-fold and increased the annual peakflow by 1.45-
fold (Anderson and others 1976). A 127 ha wildfire in
Arizona increased summer peakflows by 5- to 150-fold,
but had no effect on winter peakflows. Another wild-
fire in Arizona produced a peakflow 58-fold greater
than an unburned watershed during record autumn
rainfalls. Campbell and others (1977) documented the
effects of fire severity on peakflows. A moderate sever-
ity wildfire increased peakflow by 23-fold, but high
severity wildfire increased peakflow response three
orders of magnitude to 406.6-fold greater than undis-
turbed conditions. Krammes and Rice (1963) mea-
sured an 870-fold increase in peakflow in California
chaparral. In New Mexico, Bolin and Ward (1987)
reported a 100-fold increase in peakflow after wildfire
in a ponderosa pine and pinyon-juniper forest. Water-
sheds in the Southwest are much more prone to these
enormous peakflow responses due to interactions of
fire regimes, soils, geology, slope, and climate (Swanson
1981).
Following the Rodeo-Chediski Fire of 2002, peakflows
were orders of magnitude larger than earlier recorded.
The estimated peakflow on a gauged watershed that
experienced high severity stand-replacing fire was
almost 8.9 ft3/sec (0.25 m3/sec) or nearly 900 times that
measured prefire (Ffolliott and Neary 2003). The
peakflow on a watershed subjected to low-to-medium
severity fire was estimated to be about one-half less,
but still far in excess of the previous observations. A
subsequent and higher peakflow on the severely burned
watershed was estimated to be 232 ft3/sec (6.57 m3/sec)
or about 2,232 times that measured in snowmelt
runoff prior to the wildfire. This latter peakflow in-
crease represents the highest known relative postfire
peak flow increase that has been measured in the
ponderosa pine forest ecosystems of Arizona or, more
generally, the Southwestern United States. However,
the specific discharge (94.2 ft3/sec/mile2 or 1.02 m3/sec/
km2) was on the lower end of range of discharges
measured by Biggio and Cannon (2001).
Another concern is the timing of stormflows or
response time. Burned watersheds respond to rainfall
faster, producing more “flash floods.” They also may
increase the number of runoff events. Campbell and
others (1977) measured six events on an unburned
watershed after the Rattle Burn and 25 on a high-
severity burned watershed. Hydrophobic conditions,
bare soils, and litter and plant cover loss will cause
flood peaks to arrive faster and at higher levels. Flood
warning times are reduced by “flashy” flow, and higher
flood levels can be devastating to property and human
life. Recovery times after fires can range from years to
many decades.
Still another aspect of the postfire peakflow issue is
the fact that the largest discharges often occur in small
areas. Biggio and Cannon (2001) examined runoff after
wildfires in the Western United States. They found that
specific discharges were greatest from relatively small
areas (less than 0.4 mile2 or 1 km2, fig. 5.9). The smaller
watersheds in their study had specific discharges
averaging 17,664.3 ft3/sec/mile2 (193.0 m3/sec/km2),
while those in the next higher sized watershed category

(up to 4 mile2 or 10 km2) averaged 2,077.6 ft3/sec/mile2
(22.7 m3/sec/km2).
So, the net effect on watershed systems and aquatic
habitat of increased peakflows is a function of the area
burned, watershed characteristics, and the severity of
the fire. Small areas in flat terrain subjected to pre-
scribed fires will have little if any effect on water
resources, especially if Best Management Practices
are used. Peakflows after wildfires that burn large
areas in steep terrain can produce significant impacts,
but peakflows are probably greatest out of smaller
sized watersheds less than 0.4 mile2 (1 km2). Burned
area emergency rehabilitation (BAER) techniques may
be able to mitigate some of the impacts of wildfire (see
chapter 10). However, the ability of these techniques
to moderate the impacts of rainfalls that produce
extreme peakflow events is not well documented
(Robichaud and others 2000).
Management Implications ________
Fires affect watersheds, resulting in changes that
affect many resource values, including municipal wa-
ter, visual aspects, recreation, floral and fauna exist-
ence and welfare, transportation, and human activity
and well being. The vast extent of possible water and
watershed changes makes management of these lands
crucial.
Prescribed fires with low to moderate burn severity
rarely produce adverse hydrologic effects that land
managers need to be concerned about. Postwildfire
floods are the main concern, particularly the timing of
storm flows (response time) and magnitudes of flood
peaks. Because burned watersheds respond to rainfall
faster, producing more “flash floods,” they also may
increase the number of runoff events. Flood warning
times are reduced by these “flashy” flows, and higher
flood levels can be devastating to property and human
life. Another aspect of this is the fact that recovery
times can range from years to many decades.
So, the net effect on watershed systems and aquatic
habitat of increased peak flows is a function of the area
burned, watershed characteristics, and the severity of
the fire. Small areas in flat terrain subjected to pre-
scribed fires will have little if any effect on water re-
sources, especially if Best Management Practices are
utilized. Peak flows after wildfires that burn large areas
in steep terrain can produce significant impacts. Burned
area emergency rehabilitation watershed techniques
may be able to mitigate some of the impacts of wildfire.
However, the ability of these techniques to moder-
ate the impacts of rainfalls that produce extreme
peakflows is poorly documented (Robichaud and oth-
ers 2000). In some circumstances, a lack of willing-
ness has existed to implement effective runoff control
measures in a timely and thorough way because of
visual and environmental concerns as well as hasty,
improper installation techniques. In some instances,
BAER techniques such as contour trenching have
been able to reduce peakflow events where short
duration rainfall intensities are high but total storm
volumes are low (Robichaud and others 2000).
Increased flood flow peaks have the potential to
damage both natural and cultural resources. Large
floods often change stream geomorphology. Aquatic
biota and riparian ecosystems can be severely im-
pacted by unusual flood flows. Culverts, bridges, roads,
dams, and irrigation structures are at risk by flood
flows outside of their design parameters. Recreation
facilities, houses, businesses, and community struc-
tures can also be affected. Most important, human
health and safety can be at serious risk.
Forest managers need to understand these risks in
order to design adequate rehabilitation projects, order
and enforce recreation area closures, establish flood-
warning protocols, and conduct appropriate land man-
agement activities.
Summary ______________________
Fires affect water cycle processes to a greater or
lesser extent depending on severity. Table 5.7 con-
tains a general summary of the effects.
Fires can produce some substantial effects on the
streamflow regime of both small streams and rivers.
Tables 5.1 to 5.6 shows that fires can affect annual and
seasonal water yield, peakflows and floods, baseflows,
and timing of flows. Adequate baseflows are necessary
to support the continued existence of many wildlife
populations. Water yields are important because many
forest, scrubland, and grassland watersheds function
as municipal water supplies. Peakflows and floods are
of great concern because of their potential impacts on
human safety and property. Next to the physical
destruction of a fire itself, postfire floods are the most
damaging aspect of fire in the wildland environment.
It is important that resource specialists and managers
become aware of the potential of fires to increase
peakflows.
Following wildfires, flood peak flows can increase
dramatically, severely affecting stream physical con-
ditions, aquatic habitat, aquatic biota, cultural re-
sources, and human health and safety. Often, in-
creased flood peak flows of up to 100 times those
previously recorded, well beyond observed ranges of
variability in managed watersheds, have been mea-
sured after wildfires. Potentials exist for peak flood
flows to jump to 2,300 times prewildfire levels. Manag-
ers must be aware of these potential watershed re-
sponses in order to adequately and safely manage
their lands and other resources in the postwildfire
environment.

Introduction ____________________
Increases in streamflow discharges following a fire
can result in little to substantial effects on the physi-
cal, chemical, and biological quality of the water in
streams, rivers, and lakes. The magnitude of these
effects is largely dependent on the size, intensity, and
severity of the fire, and on the condition of the water-
shed at the time of burning (fig. 6.1). Higher postfire
streamflow discharges can result in an additional
transport to stream channels or other water bodies of
solid and dissolved materials that adversely affect the
quality of water for human, agricultural, or industrial
purposes. The most obvious effects are produced by
suspended and bedload sediments. These components
of water quality were introduced and discussed in
chapter 2, and in this chapter they are referred to in
the discussion on water quality relative to municipal
water supply quality.
Fire affects water quality characteristics through
the changes that the burning causes in the hydrologic
cycle and streamflow regimes (see chapter 5). The
effect of fire on water quality is the topic of this
chapter.

particular use. Among the physical characteristics of
interest to hydrologists and watershed managers are
sediment concentrations, turbidity, and water tem-
perature. Dissolved chemical constituents of impor-
tance include nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), calcium
(Ca), magnesium (Mg), and potassium (K). Some of
these nutrients are adsorbed on organic and inorganic
sediment particles. Bacteriological quality is also im-
portant if water is used for human consumption or
recreation. The processes in the hydrologic cycle di-
rectly or indirectly affect the magnitude of soil erosion
and, as a consequence, the transport and deposition of
sediment in water and other physical, chemical, and
biological quality characteristics that collectively de-
termine the quality of water.
A water quality standard refers to the physical, chemi-
cal, or biological criteria or characteristics of water in
relation to a specified use. It also includes the beneficial
uses and antidegradation policy. For example, a water

120

quality standard for irrigation is not necessarily accept-
able for drinking water. Changes in water quality due
to a watershed management practice could make the
water flowing from the area unsuitable for drinking,
but at the same time it could be acceptable for irriga-
tion, fisheries, and other uses. In some instances there
are laws or regulations to prevent water quality charac-
teristics from becoming degraded to the point where a
water quality standard is jeopardized (DeBano and
others 1998, Landsberg and Tiedemann 2000, Brooks
and others 2003). The main purpose of these laws and
regulations is maintaining the quality of water for a
possible, unforeseen, future use.
A major issue that hydrologist and watershed man-
agers often confront is whether forest or rangeland
fires will create conditions in stream, river, or lake
waters that are outside of the established water qual-
ity standards and, as a consequence, will require
remedial actions to bring the water within the stan-
dards. Water quality standards that have been estab-
lished by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(1999) are the “benchmarks” for water quality through-
out the United States. The most adverse effects from
wildfires on water quality standards come from physi-
cal effects of the sediment and ash that are deposited
into streams. However, stream chemistry parameters
can be exceeded.
Several chemical constituents that are regulated by
water quality standards are likely to be impacted by
burning. Primary standards in the regulations of the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cover nitrate-
nitrogen (NO3-N), nitrite-nitrogen (NO2-N), and other
substances that are not immediately associated with
fire. Secondary standards apply to pH, sulfate (SO4-S),
total dissolved solids (TDS), chloride (Cl), iron (Fe),
turbidity, and several other constituents. Secondary
standards are also set for color and odor. Phosphate
phosphorus (PO4-P) can affect water quality because
of its ability to affect the color and odor of water by
accelerating the eutrophication process. That water
quality standards can be impacted and exceeded by
fire in some cases is also examined in this chapter.
Soil Erosion and Sedimentation
Processes _____________________
Changes in the hydrologic cycle caused by fire can
also affect the rate of soil erosion, the subsequent
transport and deposition of the eroded soil as sedi-
ment, and the chemical characteristics that collec-
tively determine the quality of water (DeBano and
others 1998, Brooks and others 2003). Alterations that
burning can cause in the hydrologic cycle, that in turn
affect soil erosion, sedimentation, and water quality,
are considered in chapter 5.
Soil erosion is the physical process of the force of
raindrops or eddies in overland flow (surface runoff)
dislodging soil particles, which are then transported
by water or wind or the force of gravity (Dunne and
Leopold 1978, Satterlund and Adams 1992, Brooks
and others 2003). Sedimentation is the process of
deposition of sediment in stream channels or down-
stream reservoirs or other point of use.
Increased soil erosion, or sediment, is often the most
viable effect of a fire other than the loss of vegetation
by burning. Maintaining a vegetative cover or a cover
of litter and other organic material on the soil surface
of a watershed is the best means of preventing exces-
sive soil erosion rates. However, fire can cause the loss
of these protective covers and in turn cause excessive
soil erosion and soil lost from the burned site (Dunne
and Leopold 1978, Satterlund and Adams 1992, Brooks
and others 2003).
Natural rates of sedimentation are generally lower
in high rainfall regions than in arid and semiarid
regions (Brooks and others 2003). As a result of the
infrequent “big storms” that are characteristic of arid
and semiarid environments, sedimentation is often
viewed as a discontinuous (unsteady) process where
sediment runs from its source through a stream chan-
nel system with intermittent periods of storage
(Wolman 1977, Baker 1990, Baker and others 1998).
The disproportionate amount of sediment transported
by these big storms makes it difficult to determine a
“normal rate” of sedimentation on either undisturbed
or burned watersheds in arid and semiarid regions
(DeBano and others 1998).
Only a portion of the sediment is passed through and
out of a watershed with a single storm event. Most of
the sediment that is generated by a storm is deposited

at the base of hillslopes, in floodplains following high
overland flows, and within stream or river channels
(DeBano and others 1998, Brooks and others 2003).
The relationships between hillslope soil erosion and
downslope and downstream sedimentation involve a
complexity of channel processes and their dynamics,
both of which are poorly understood. Nevertheless, the
sediment that is eventually deposited into the chan-
nels following a fire changes the physical characteris-
tics of the water flowing from the burned watershed.
Physical Characteristics of
Water _________________________
Among the more important physical characteristics
of postfire streamflow regimes of main interest to
hydrologists and watershed managers are suspended
sediment concentrations and turbidity and elevated
streamflow temperatures (thermal pollution). Sus-
pended sediment consisting of silts and colloids of soil
materials impacts on water quality in terms of human,
agricultural, and industrial uses of the water and
aquatic organisms and their environments (see chap-
ter 7). Elevated streamflow temperatures can also
impact water quality characteristics and aquatic or-
ganisms and environments.
Sediment
Watersheds that have been severely denuded by a
wildfire are often vulnerable to accelerated rates of
soil erosion and, therefore, can yield large (but often
variable) amounts of postfire sediment (fig. 6.2).
Wildfires generally produce more sediment than pre-
scribed burning. The large inputs of sediment into a
stream following a wildfire can tax the transport
capacity of the stream and lead to channel deposition
(aggradation). However, prescribed burns by their
design do not normally consume extensive layers of
litter or accumulations of other organic materials.
Hence, sedimentation is generally less than that
resulting from a wildfire.
Suspended Sediment Concentrations and Tur-
bidity—Suspended sediment concentrations and tur-
bidity are often the most dramatic of water quality
responses to fire. Turbidity is an expression of the
optical property of water that scatters light (Dunne
and Leopold 1978, Satterlund and Adams 1992, Brooks
and others 2003). Turbidity reduces the depth to
which sunlight can penetrate into water and, there-
fore, influences the rate of photosynthesis. Sediment
concentrations are commonly expressed in parts per
million (ppm) or milligrams per liter (mg/L) (Interna-
tional System of Units), while turbidity is measured in
nephelometeric units. Postfire increases in suspended
sediment concentrations and turbidity can result from
erosion and overland flow, channel scouring because
of the increased streamflow discharge, creep accumu-
lations in stream channels, or combinations of all
three actions after a fire.
Less is known about the effect of fire on turbidity
than on the sedimentation processes. One problem
contributing to this lack of information is that turbid-
ity has been historically difficult to measure because it
is highly transient, variable, inconsistent, and varies
by instrument used. With the development of continu-
ous turbidimeters or nephelometers, some suspended
sediment estimates are now based on continuous tur-
bidity measurements. These turbidity estimates must
be translated to suspended sediment using turbidity-
to-suspended sediment rating curves that are time
consuming, carefully calibrated, site specific, and in-
strument specific.
Nevertheless, it has been observed that postfire
turbidity levels in stream water are affected by the
steepness of the burned watershed (table 6.1). The
turbidity of overland flow from burned steep slopes in
central Texas that had been converted from woodland
to an herbaceous cover was higher than that of
overland flow from burned slopes of lesser steepness
(Wright and others 1976, 1982). Turbidity increases
after fires are generally a result of the postfire sus-
pension of ash and silt-to-clay sized soil particles in
the water (fig. 6.3).
The primary standards for suspended sediment con-
centration and turbidity with respect to drinking wa-
ter are written in terms of turbidity (U.S. Environ-
mental Protection Agency 1999). However, only two of
the studies reviewed by Landsberg and Tiedemann

zona, 2002. Note recently deposited sediment in the

(2000) in their synthesis of the scientific literature on
the effects of fire on drinking water used turbidity
measured in nephelometric units as a measure of the
suspended sediment concentrations of water (table
6.1). Other studies reported concentrations of sus-
pended sediment in ppm or mg/L as the measure
(table 6.2). While suspended sediment concentra-
tions in ppm (mg/L) have been converted to turbidity
in nephelometric units in studies of nutrient losses by
soil erosion after wildfire, the relationship is site-
specific. Beschta (1980) found that a relationship
between suspended sediment concentrations and
turbidity can be established for a specified watershed
in some instances, but that the relationship differs
significantly among watersheds. He suggested, there-
fore, that this relationship be established on a water-
shed-by-watershed basis.
The few postfire values for turbidity found in the
literature (table 6.1) exceed the allowable water quality
standard for turbidty (U.S. Environmental Protection

Agency 1999). Therefore, Landsberg and Tiedemann
(2000) recommended that the effect of fire on turbidity
per se needs further investigation to better under-
stand the processes involved. Because of the elevated
suspended sediment concentrations after fire and fire-
related treatments, it is difficult to imagine that some
of these concentrations would not have produced tur-
bidity above the permitted level for water supplies.
Sediment Yields—While the level of suspended
sediment concentrations is a primary factor of envi-
ronmental concern, sediment yield is important in
estimating the sediment buildup in reservoirs or other
impoundments (Wetzel 1983). The sediment yield of a
watershed is the total sediment outflow from the
watershed for a specified period of time and a defined
point in the stream channel. Sediment yields are
dependent mostly on the physical characteristics of
the sediment, the supply of soil particles to a stream
channel, the magnitude and rate of streamflow dis-
charge, and the condition of the watershed. The values
presented in tables 2.8 to 2.10 are indicative of the
level of variability that can be expected in the changes
in sediment yields following a fire. This variability
generally reflects the interacting factors of geology,
soil, topography, vegetation, fire characteristics,
weather patterns, and land use practices on the im-
pacted watershed. The higher values resulted from
fires on steep slopes and areas of decomposing granite
that readily erode. These higher sediment yields are
sufficient in their magnitude to generate concern
about soil impoverishment and water turbidity. The
lower values were generally associated with flat sites
and lower severity fires. Although the magnitudes
shown are site specific, the changes in sediment trans-
port presented reflect responses that can be expected
from wildfire and prescribed burning.
Postfire sediment yields are generally the highest in
the first year or so after burning, especially when the
burned watershed has been exposed to large, high-
intensity rainfall events immediately after the fire has
exposed the soil surface. These sediment yields are
indicative of the partial or complete consumption of
litter and other decomposed organic matter on the soil
surface, a reduction in infiltration, and a consequent
increase in overland flow (DeBano and others 1998,
Brooks and others 2003). Sediment yields typically
decline in subsequent years as the protective vegeta-
tion becomes reestablished on the burned watershed.
Water Temperature
Water temperature is a critical water quality charac-
teristic of many streams and aquatic habitats. Tem-
perature controls the survival of certain flora and fauna
in the water that are sensitive to water temperature.
The removal of streambank vegetation by burning can
cause water temperature to rise, causing thermal pol-
lution to occur, which in turn can increase biological
activity in a stream (DeBano and others 1998, Brooks
and others 2003). Increases in biological activity place
a greater demand on the dissolved oxygen content of the
water, one of the more important water quality charac-
teristics from a biological perspective.
There are no established national standards for the
temperature of drinking water. However, under the
Clean Water Act, States are required to develop water
quality standards to protect beneficial uses such as
fish habitat and water quality restoration. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency provides oversight
and approval of these State standards. Currently,
about 86 percent of the national listings of waterbodies
with temperature-impaired water quality are in the
Pacific Northwest (Ice and others, in press). One of the
problems with these standards is identifying natural
temperature patterns caused by vegetation, geology,
geomorphology, climate, season, and natural distur-
bance history. Also, increases in stream water tem-
peratures can have important and often detrimental
effects on stream eutrophication. Acceleration of
stream eutrophication can adversely affect the color,
taste, and smell of drinking water.
Severe wildfires can function like streamside timber
clearcuts in raising the temperature of streams due to
direct heating of the water surface. Increases up to
62 ∞F (16.7 ∞C) have been measured in streamflows
following fire, and following timber harvesting and
fire in combination (table 6.3). When riparian (stream-
side) vegetation is removed by fire or other means, the
stream surface is exposed to direct solar radiation, and
stream temperatures increase (Levno and Rothacher
1969, Brown 1970, Swift and Messner 1971, Gibbons
and Salo 1973, Brooks and others 2003).
Another important aspect of the temperature issue
is the increase in fish mortality posed by stream
temperature increases. The main concerns relative to
aquatic biota are the reduction in the concentrations of
dissolved oxygen (O2) that occurs with rising tempera-
tures, fish pathogen activity, and elevated metabolic
activity. All of these can impair the survivability and
sustainability of aquatic populations and communi-
ties. Dissolved O2 contents are affected by tempera-
ture, altitude, water turbulence, aquatic organism
respiration, aquatic plant photosynthesis, inorganic
reactions, and tributary inflow. When O2 concentra-
tions become less than 10 ppm (less than 10 mg/L),
they create problems for salmonid fishes. Increases of
2 to 9 ∞F (1-5 ∞C), which are not a problem at sea level,
become problematic for salmonids at high altitude.
Warm water fishes can tolerate stream temperatures
below 10 ppm (10 mg/L) and are not as easily impacted
by O2 concentration declines.

pH of Water
The pH of water at a point in time is an indication of
the balance of chemical equilibria in a water body. Its
level affects the presence of some chemicals in the
water. The pH of water can be affected by ash deposi-
tions immediately after a fire. In the first year after
fire, increased pH values of the soil (Wells and others
1979, DeBano and others 1998, Landsberg and
Tiedemann 2000) can also contribute to increased
values of streamflow pH. A secondary drinking water
quality standard for pH is 6.5 to 8.5 (U.S. Environmen-
tal Protection Agency 1999). In the investigations
reviewed by Landsberg and others (1999), there was
only one study that reported pH values outside the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standards
(table 6.4). During the first 8 months after the Entiat
Fires in eastern Washington, Tiedemann (1973) de-
tected transient pH values up to 9.5 in streamflow
water and, 2 days after fertilizer application, a
transient pH value of 9.2. These latter values are
generally reflective of toxic limits in the water.
Chemical Characteristics of
Water _________________________
Watershed-scale studies provide an integrated view
of the effects of fire on chemical (ionic) concentrations
and losses. Some investigators have reported little
effects of burning on the chemical concentrations in
water following burning of a watershed and, therefore,
have concluded that reported increases in streamflow
resulting from fire-caused transpirational reductions
had likely masked concentration effects (Helvey and
others 1976, Tiedemann and others 1978, Gottfried
and DeBano 1990, DeBano and others 1998). Other
investigators observed higher concentrations of some
chemicals in streamflow from burned watersheds
(Snyder and others 1975, Campbell and others 1977).
However, these elevated concentrations often return
to prefire levels after the first flush of flow.
Dissolved Chemical Constituents
The main sources of dissolved chemical constituents
(nutrients) in the water flowing from watersheds are
geologic weathering, decompositions of photosynthetic
products into inorganic substances, and large storm
events. Vegetative communities accumulate and cycle
large quantities of nutrients in their biological role of
linking soil, water, and atmosphere into a biological
continuum (Tiedemann and others 1979, DeBano and
others 1998, Brooks and others 2003). Nutrients are
cycled in a largely orderly (tight) and often predictable
manner until a disturbance alters the form of their
distribution. One such disturbance is fire.
The effects of fire on the nutrient capital (status) of
a watershed ecosystem are largely manifested by a
rapid mineralization and dispersion of plant nutrients

from an intrabiotic to an extrabiotic state (Grier 1975,
Tiedemann and others 1979, DeBano and others 1998,
Brooks and others 2003). Part of the plant- and litter-
incorporated N, P, K, Ca, Mg, copper (Cu), Fe, manga-
nese (Mn), and zinc (Zn) are volatilized and, through
this process, evacuated from the system. Metallic
nutrients such as Ca, Mg, and K are converted into
oxides and deposited as ash layers on the soil surface.
Oxides are low in solubility until they react with
carbon dioxide (CO2) and water in the atmosphere
and, as a result, are converted into bicarbonate salts.
In this form, they are more soluble and vulnerable to
loss through leaching or overland flow than they are as
oxides, or they are incorporated into plant tissues or
litter.
In a postfire situation where, compared to prefire
conditions, there are less vegetative cover and lower
accumulations of litter and other organic materials,
the result is an increase in susceptibility to nutrient
loss from a watershed through erosion. With a reduced
vegetative cover, soil-plant cycling mechanisms re-
duce nutrient uptake, further increasing the potential
nutrient loss by leaching. Responses of ionic concen-
trations of the more important nutrients to burning
are discussed in the following paragraphs.
Nitrogen
NO3-N, NH4-N, and organic-N are the nitrogen
forms most commonly studied as indicators of fire
disturbance. Most of the attention of hydrologists and
watershed managers relative to water quality re-
sponses to fire focuses on NO3-N because it is highly
mobile. The potential for increased NO3-N in
streamflow after burning is attributed mainly to
accelerated mineralization and nitrification (Vitousek
and Melillo 1979, Covington and Sackett 1986, 1992,
DeBano and others 1998) and reduced plant demand
(Vitousek and Melillo 1979). This increase results
from the conversion of organic N to available forms
(Kovacic and others 1986), mineralization (Covington
and Sackett 1992, Ojima and others 1994), or mobili-
zation by microbial biomass through the fertilizing
effect of ash nutrients and improved microclimate
(Koelling and Kucera 1965, Hulbert 1969, Ojima and
others 1995). These postfire effects are short lived,
however, usually lasting only a year or so (Kovacic and
others 1986, Monleon and others 1997).
The response of NO3-N to burning is varied. Some
investigators have found no significant change in the
postfire levels of NO3-N in streamflows, while others

report increases of NO3-N in either the soil solution
or streamflow (Hibbert and others 1974, Tiedemann
and others 1979). Examples of increases in NO3-N
(table 6.5) with fire and followup applications of
herbicides causing the largest increases are shown in
most studies of forest disturbances such as fire.
The most striking response of NO3-N concentration
in streamflow to fire (and the only case not related to
herbicides where the primary water quality standard
was exceeded) was observed in southern California,
where N loadings from atmospheric deposition are
relatively high, and the frequent wildfires in the
chaparral shrublands are often high in their fire
severities (Riggan and others 1994). Severe burning
of a watershed in this Mediterranean-type resulted
in a maximum NO3-N level of 15.3 ppm (mg/L) in
streamflow compared to 2.5 ppm (mg/L) in streamflow
from an unburned control watershed. Maximum con-
centration for a moderately burned watershed was
9.5 ppm (mg/L). These results are likely to represent
an “unusual response” because the watersheds stud-
ied were subject to a chronic atmospheric deposition
of pollutants. Regardless of the treatment or treat-
ment combinations on these watersheds, levels of
NO3-N in the streamflows were well below maximum
allowable concentrations in most other studies.
Beschta (1990) reached the same conclusion in his
assessment of streamflow NO3-N responses to fire
and associated treatments.

Tiedemann (1973) and Tiedemann and others (1978)
show that fertilizer application following fire resulted
in higher concentrations of NO3-N in streamflows
than fire alone. It is probably safe to conclude, how-
ever, that neither fire nor fertilization after fire will
have adverse effects on NO3-N in drinking water
(Tiedemann and others 1978, Landsberg and others
1999, Scatena 2000).
NO2-N was reported by itself rather than in combi-
nation with N03-N in two studies on the effects of fire
on the chemical concentrations of streamflows in Cali-
fornia and Washington. At the Lexington Reservoir in
southern California, Taylor and others (1993) found
NO2-N levels of 0.03 ppm (mg/L) in streamflows after
a wildfire occurred in a subwatershed that drains into
the reservoir, while control levels were 0.01 ppm (mg/L).
Tiedemann (1973) reported that NO2-N concentra-
tions were below that of analytical detection after a
wildfire occurred in eastern Washington.
Other studies on the effects of wildfire or prescribed
burning on both N and other dissolved chemical con-
stituents are summarized in the following paragraphs.
The observed elevated postfire ionic concentrations
observed in these studies returned to prefire levels
after the first flush of flows following the fire in most
cases.
The maximum concentrations of NO3-N in
streamflows increased from less than 0.016 to 0.56 ppm
(mg/L) in the 3 years after a wildfire destroyed the
mixed conifer forest cover on a 1,410 acre (564 ha)
watershed in eastern Washington (Tiedemann and
others 1978). These increases appeared to be a result of
increased nitrification. Concentrations of total P in the
streamflow from the burned watershed were 1.5 to
three times greater than those from an undisturbed
watershed. Despite the lack of prefire information,
elevated levels of these magnitudes indicate that the
wildfire significantly affected the P levels in streamflow,
at least in the short term. The combined concentrations
of Ca, Mg, K, and Na in streamflow before the fire
ranged from 12.0 to 14.9 ppm (mg/L). The concentra-
tions declined to a range of 7.4 to 10.5 ppm (mg/L) in the
second postfire year because of the dilution caused by
increased streamflow. These losses were insignificant
relative to the total capital of these nutrients, however.
The chemical quality of streamflows from two small
watersheds that originally supported ponderosa pine
forests in northern Arizona was not greatly affected by
a wildfire (Campbell and others 1977). One watershed
of 20.2 acres (8.1 ha) was severely burned while a
smaller watershed of 10 acres (4 ha) was moderately
burned. While concentrations of Ca, Mg, and K in-
creased with the first postfire streamflow events from
these watersheds, concentrations of these ions de-
creased rapidly in subsequent flow events. Sodium
(Na) concentrations were largely unaffected by the fire
or the observed changes in streamflow discharges.
Combined organic-inorganic N concentrations also
increased in the initial postfire streamflow event and
then quickly decreased to the level that was found in
streamflow from the unburned watershed.
The magnitude of stream water quality changes for
N after prescribed fire are normally less than those
observed after wildfires. It is unlikely that prescribed
burning would consume as much of the litter and other
organic materials, understory herbaceous vegetation,
or overstory trees as severe wildfires (McNabb and
Cromack 1990, DeBano and others 1998). Stream
chemistry responses to prescribed fire in an undis-
turbed 1,163 acre (470 ha) Southwestern ponderosa
pine forest watershed (Gottfried and DeBano 1990)
support the speculation of minimal changes in N
following a prescribed fire. Surface fuels were burned
on 43 percent of this watershed, and 5 percent of the
trees were killed. The prescribed fire resulted in rela-
tively small increases in NO3-N in the streamflow, the
levels of which did not approach the primary water
quality standard. Measures taken to protect streams
and riparian corridors with unburned buffers could
also minimize effects of fire on stream chemistry.
Several studies show that increased streamflow
discharges and increased concentrations of N in the
streamflow from burned areas can cause an acceler-
ated loss of N from watershed lands in the short term.
While these losses in N have not been referenced to the
total N capital on a watershed, these losses likely pose
little threat to continued onsite productivity (DeBano
and others 1998, Brooks and others 2003).
The primary drinking water standard for NO3-N
is 10 ppm (mg/L), and the standard for NO2-N is 1 ppm
(m/L). There is no standard for dissolved organic N,
NH4-N, or urea-N in drinking water. The combined
concentrations of these N forms seldom exceed 1 ppm
(mg/L), and dissolved organic N is usually the most
abundant form.
Phosphorus
Phosphorus is present in several forms in soil solu-
tion and streamflow. These are reactive orthophos-
phate (inorganic phosphate), dissolved complex or-
ganic phosphate, particulate organic phosphate, and
other inorganic forms (Ice 1996). Total phosphate
(PO4-P) is reported as total P in most of the studies of
the P response to fire. PO4-P is not as readily leached
as NO3-N because it complexes with organic com-
pounds in the soil (Black 1968). Studies of soil leachates
have reported increased levels of total phosphorous
due to burning, indicating accelerated mobilization of
phosphorous after burning (McColl and Grigal 1975,
Knighton 1977). PO4-P concentrations in streamflows
prior to fire can range from 0.007 to 0.17 ppm (mg/L)

128
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
(Longstreth and Patten 1975, Hoffman and Ferreira
1976, Wright and others 1976, Tiedemann and others
1978, Tiedemann and others 1988). After wildfire,
prescribed burning, or the clearcutting of timber fol-
lowed by broadcast burning of the slash, Longstreth
and Patten (1975) reported that PO4-P concentrations
stayed the same or increased only as high as 0.2 ppm
(mg/L).
Phosphorus concentrations in overland flow from the
hillslopes of a watershed can increase as a result of
burning, although these increases are not always suffi-
cient to alter the quality of the watershed’s streamflow
regime (Longstreth and Patten 1975, Gifford and oth-
ers 1976). There is no established standard for PO4-P in
drinking water. Phosphorus can be limiting in aquatic
habitats, but once in the water, it is taken up quickly by
aquatic organisms, especially algae.
Sulfur
Sulfate (SO4-S) is relatively mobile in soil-water
systems (Johnson and Cole 1977). Although not as
well studied as those for N, the mineralization pro-
cesses for S are essentially similar. Observed levels of
SO4-S in the streamflow from most wildland water-
sheds are inherently low. Prefire concentrations of the
ion can range from as low as 1.17 ppm (mg/L) to as high
as 66 ppm (mg/L), while postfire values range from 1.7
to 76 ppm (mg/L). All of the SO4-S concentrations
reported by Landsberg and Tiedemann (2000) were
below the secondary water quality standard for drink-
ing water of 250 ppm (mg/L) (U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency 1999).
Chloride
Chloride ion (Cl) responses to fire have been docu-
mented in several studies (Landsberg and Tiedemann
2000). All responses were significantly lower (less than
5 ppm, or mg/L) than the water quality standard of 250
ppm (mg/L) established by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (1999). Concentrations of some natu-
ral sources of Cl (such as geothermal areas) are report-
edly larger than those produced by wildfires.
Bicarbonate
Bicarbonate ions in soil solutions and streamflows
are often increased as a consequence of burning. The
bicarbonate ion represents the principal anion in soil
solution, the end product of root respiration and a
product of oxide conversion after fire (McColl and Cole
1968, Tiedemann and others 1979, DeBano and others
1998). Concomitant fluctuations of bicarbonate and
cation concentrations indicate that bicarbonate is a
main carrier of cations in the soil solution (Davis
1987).
Total Dissolved Solids
In their synthesis of the scientific literature on the
quality of drinking water originating from natural
ecosystems, Landsberg and Tiedemann (2000) found
only two studies that reported concentrations of total
dissolved solids (TDS), although the investigators in
other studies have measured some of the constituents
of TDS but not TDS per se. Hoffman and Ferreira
(1976) detected TDS concentrations of about 11 ppm
(mg/L) in the streamflow from an unburned area in
Kings Canyon National Park of California and 13 ppm
(mg/L) in the streamflow from an adjacent burned
area, which had been a mixed conifer and shrub stand.
Lathrop (1994) found that Yellowstone Lake and Lewis
Lake in Yellowstone National Park had prefire TDS
concentrations of 65.8 and 70 ppm (mg/L), respec-
tively, and that these concentrations were similar to
those observed after the fires. These values were
significantly below the secondary standard of TDS for
drinking water of 500 ppm (mg/L) recommended by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (1999).
Nutrients and Heavy Metals
Heavy metals are a growing concern in some for-
ested areas of the United States. Particular concern
exists about the release of heavy metals to the air and
eventually to streams by increased prescribed fire
programs and large wildfires (Lefevre, personal com-
munication). Information on this aspect of water qual-
ity and fire use and management is relatively scarce.
One potentially important source of nutrient and
heavy metal loss from a watershed that is often ig-
nored is that transported by sediment particles (Gifford
and Busby 1973, Fisher and Minckley 1978, Gosz and
others 1980, Brooks and others 2003). Sediment has
been reported to transport relatively high levels of
nutrients and heavy metals (Angino and others 1974,
Potter and others 1975), although most of these inves-
tigators have looked at large river basins consisting of
numerous combinations of bedrock and vegetation.
Few studies have focused directly on the effects of
fire on nutrient and heavy metal losses that are
transported by sediment from smaller upland water-
sheds. One study reported that sediment losses of N,
P, and ions in streamflow from burned watersheds in
chaparral shrublands of southern California chapar-
ral can substantially exceed those lost in solution
(DeBano and Conrad 1978). Nitrogen and P losses of
13.5 and 3.0 lb/acre (5.1 and 3.4 kg/ha), respectively,
were found in sediments, as compared to only trace
levels in solution. Furthermore, losses of Ca, Mg, Na,
and K in solution were only one-fourth of the losses in
sediment. However, sediment and solution losses of N,
P, K, Mg, Ca, and Na were only a small fraction of the

total prefire nutrient capital of plants, litter accumu-
lations, and the upper 4 inches (10 cm) of soil.
Biological Quality of Water________
Accumulations of litter and of other decomposed
organic matter on the soil surface often function as a
filter that removes bacteria and other biological or-
ganisms from overland flow. Rainfall-induced runoff
and snowmelt that percolates through a litter layer or
strip of organic matter can contain fewer bacteria than
water that had not passed through the strip (DeBano
and others 1998, Brooks and others 2003). It follows,
therefore, that the destruction of this layer or strip by
burning might result in higher concentrations of bac-
terial and other biological organisms flowing overland
to a stream channel.
Fire Retardants _________________
Fire retardants are frequently used in the suppres-
sion of wildfires. Although their effects on the soil-
water environment are not a direct effect of fire, their
use in the control of wildfires can produce adverse
environmental impacts. A brief discussion of fire re-
tardant effects on water quality is provided here to
acquaint the reader with the topic. More detailed
reviews and studies have been completed by Labat
and Anderson Inc. (1994), Adams and Simmons (1999),
Kalabokidis (2000), and Gimenez and others (2004).
The main environmental concerns with fire retardant
use are: (1) effects on water quality and aquatic organ-
isms, (2) toxicity to vegetation, and (3) human health
effects.
Ammonium-based fire retardants (diammonium
phosphate, monoammonium phosphate, ammonium
sulfate, or ammonium polyphosphate) play an impor-
tant role in protecting watershed resources from de-
structive wildfire (fig. 6.4; table 6.6). However, their
use can affect water quality in some instances, and
they can also be toxic to aquatic biota (table 6.7; see
also chapter 7).
Nitrogen-containing fire retardants have the poten-
tial to affect the quality of drinking water, although
the research on the applications of these retardants to
streams has largely focused on their impacts on aquatic
environments (Norris and Webb 1989). For example,
in an in vitro study to determine the toxicity of some
retardant formulations to stream organisms, McDonald
and others (1996) evaluated the impacts of two nonfoam
retardants containing SO4-S, PO4-P, and ammonium
compounds (Fire-trol GST-R and Phos-Chek D75-F), a
retardant containing ammonium and phosphate
compounds (Fire-Trol LCG-R), and two foam suppres-
sant compounds that contained neither S, P, nor
ammonium compounds (Phos-Chek WD-881 and

Silv-Ex). These investigators found that concentra-
tions of NO3-N in water rose from (0.08) to 3.93 ppm
(mg/L) after adding the nonfoam retardants. They also
discovered that NO2-N reached concentrations as high
as 33.2 ppm (mg/L), well above the primary water
quality standard of 1 ppm (mg/L). However, the solu-
tions they tested were much less concentrated than
that which is used in firefighting.
The main chemical of concern in streams 24 hours
after a retardant drop is ammonia nitrogen (NH3 +
NH4
+; table 6.6). Un-ionized ammonia (NH3) is the
principal toxic component to aquatic species. The
distances downstream in which potentially toxic con-
ditions persist depend on stream volume, the number
of retardant drops, and the orientation of drops to the
stream long-axis (table 6.8). While concentrations of

130

NH3 + NH4
+ can reach 200 to 300 ppm (mg/L) within
164 to 328 feet (50-100 m)  below drop points, toxic
levels may persist for over 3,280 feet (1,000 m) of
stream channel.
Inadvertent applications of fire retardants into a
stream could have water quality consequences for
NO3-N, SO4-S, and possibly trace elements. However,
information about these potential effects of retardants
on water quality is limited.
Another source of concern is fire retardants that con-
tain sodium ferrocyanide (YPS) (Little and Calfee 2002).
Photo-enhanced YPS has a low lethal concentration in
water for aquatic organisms. Fortunately, YPS, like the
Table 6.7—Fire retardant lethal levels for aquatic organisms (Adapted from Johnson
and Sanders 1977).

other retardant chemicals, is adsorbed onto organic and
mineral cation exchange sites in soils. Thus, its potential
for leaching out of soils is reduced.
Gimenez and others (2004) concluded that the most
significant environmental impact of fire retardants is
the toxic effect on aquatic organisms in streams. They
noted that the amount of fire retardant used and its
placement on the landscape are the two main factors
determining the degree of environmental impact.
Thus, placement planning and operational control of
fire retardant aircraft are critical for minimizing im-
pacts on streams and lakes and their biota.

Rodeo-Chediski Fire, 2002: A Water
Quality Case History _____________
The Rodeo-Chediski Fire of 2002 was the largest
wildfire in Arizona’s history (Neary and Gottfried
2002, Ffolliott and Neary 2003). This fire damaged,
destroyed, or disrupted the hydrologic functioning and
ecological structure of the ponderosa pine forest eco-
systems at the headwaters of the Salt River, a major
river supplying the city of Phoenix’s main water sup-
ply reservoir, Lake Roosevelt. The Rodeo-Chediski
Fire was actually two fires that ignited on lands of the
White Mountain Apache Nation and merged into one.
Arson was the cause of the Rodeo Fire, which began a
few miles from Cibecue, a small streamside village, on
June 18, 2002. The Chediski Fire was set on the
Reservation as a signal fire by a seemingly lost person
a few days later. This second fire spread out of control,
moving toward and eventually merged with the ongo-
ing and still out of control Rodeo Fire. Burning north-
eastwardly, the renamed Rodeo-Chediski Fire then
burned onto the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest,
along the Mogollon Rim in central Arizona, and into
many of the White Mountain tourist communities
scattered along the Mogollon Rim from Heber to Show
Low. Over 30,000 local people were eventually forced
to flee the inferno.
The Rodeo-Chediski Fire had burned 276,507 acres
(111,898 ha) of Apache land, and the remainder of the
total of 467,066 acres (189,015 ha) were on the Apache-
Sitgreaves National Forest. Nearly 500 buildings were
destroyed; more than half of the burned structures
were houses of local residents or second homes of
summer visitors. Rehabilitation efforts began imme-
diately after the fire was controlled and after it was
declared safe to enter into the burned area. Two BAER
teams operated out of the White Mountain Apache
Tribe headquarters at White River, AZ, and the other
for the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest at Show
Low, AZ. Watershed protection was of prime impor-
tance because of the municipal watershed values of
these lands.
Culverts were removed from roads to help mitigate
the anticipated flash flooding that is often caused by
high-intensity, short-duration monsoonal rainfall
events that commonly occur in Arizona from early July
through August and, occasionally, into September.
Temporary detention dams and other diversions were
constructed to divert intermittent water flows initi-
ated by these storms away from critical infrastruc-
tures. In a major rehabilitation activity, helicopters
ferried bales of straw to burned sites susceptible to
erosion, and the straw was spread onto the ground to
alleviate the erosive impact of the monsoonal rain.
Seeding of rapidly established grasses and other
herbaceous plants accompanied this rehabilitative
activity, which continued into the late summer and
early autumn.
Water-quality constituents of primary interest to
hydrologists, land managers, and watershed manag-
ers in Southwestern ecosystems are sediment concen-
trations and dissolved nutrients, specifically nitrogen
and phosphorus (DeBano and others 1996). In July,
monsoon thunderstorms initiated storm runoff from
the wildfire-burned area. While there was not an
opportunity to collect samples to determined the qual-
ity characteristics of the water flows from several
watersheds within the Rodeo-Chediski Fire area
(Stermer Ridge watersheds; Ffolliott and Neary 2003),
samples were taken of the ash and sediment-laden
streamflow farther downstream where the Salt River
enters into Lake Roosevelt. The storm runoff
streamflows contained large amounts of organic de-
bris, dissolved nutrients (including nitrogen, phos-
phorus, and carbon), and other chemicals that were
released by the fire. Some of the elevated concentra-
tions of nitrogen and phosphorus may have originated
from the fire retardants dropped to slow the advance-
ment of the fire.
The sediment- and organic-rich water significantly
increased the flow of water into the Salt River, the
major tributary to the Theodore Roosevelt Reservoir,
a primary source of water for Phoenix and its sur-
rounding metropolitan communities. The Salt River
Project provides drinking and irrigation water, as well
as power, to 2 million residential, business, and indus-
trial customers in a 2,900 mile2 (7,511 km2) service
area in parts of Maricopa, Gila, and Pinal Counties,
Arizona (Autobee 1993). Water is furnished primarily
by the Salt and Verde Rivers, which drain a watershed
area of 13,000 miles2 (33,670 km2). Four storage reser-
voirs on the Salt River form a continuous chain of lakes
almost 60 miles (96 km) long. An important supple-
mental supply is obtained from well pumping units.
Capacity assigned to flood control is 556,000 acre-feet
(685.8 million m3).  Total storage capacity of Salt
River reservoirs is more than 2.4 million acre-feet
(3.0 trillion m3). Total hydroelectric generating capac-
ity is 232 megawatts, including power from pumped
storage units.
What made this situation more serious than would
be expected were the size of the Rodeo-Chediski Fire
and the critically low level of the drought-impacted
Roosevelt reservoir, which was less than 15 percent of
its capacity at the time of the fire. The reservoir has a
drainage area of 5,830 miles2 (3.7 million acres or 1.5
million ha) of which about 12 percent was burned in
the Rodeo-Chediski Fire. Even with a small percent
burned, there was a concern that the flow of ash and
debris might threaten the aquatic life inhabiting the
reservoir, leaving it lifeless for months to come. How-
ever, this dire situation failed to materialize. Even

132
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
though some fish died upstream of the reservoir and a
few carcasses showed up at the diversion dam above
Roosevelt Dam, the reservoir water body itself suf-
fered little permanent environmental damage.
The largest pulses in water quality parameters were
for suspended sediment, conductivity, and turbidity.
Nutrient levels (particularly P and N) in the water
shot off the chart in the first few days of monsoon-
induced storm runoff (U.S. Geological Survey 2002,
Tecle, personal communication; table 6.9) but fell
quickly, and therefore, the large algae blooms that
were predicted to form and consume much of the
water’s oxygen did not form. The postfire debris in the
water was never a health risk to people as most of the
pollutants were easily removed at water treatment
plants. The outcome would be different in a situation
where a much larger percentage of a municipal water-
shed is burned by a wildfire.
Management Implications ________
A number of management considerations relate to
water quality and the use or management of pre-
scribed fires and wildfires. These considerations are
tied to both Federal and State regulations and laws
such as the National Forest Management Act of 1976,
the Clean Water Act of 1972 as amended, the Code of
Federal Regulations (36 CFR 219.13), and State laws.
The purpose of these laws and regulations is to
conserve soil and water resources, minimize serious
or long-lasting hazards from flood, wind, wildfire,
erosion, or other natural forces, and to protect streams,
lakes, wetlands, and other bodies of water. The ap-
proach of these regulations is to use Best Manage-
ment Practices to achieve water quality goals and
protection. Special attention is given to land and
vegetation in recognizable areas dominated by ripar-
ian vegetation.
Several sources of conservation measures guide-
lines relate to the use of prescribed fire (table 6.10) and
the management of wildfire (table 6.11) to maintain
water quality. These include the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (1993), the USDA Forest Service
(1988, 1989a,b, 1990a), California Department of
Forestry (1998), Georgia Forestry Association (1995),
to mention just a few.
In some instances conservation measures may be
prohibitive or at least impractical because of local
terrain conditions, hydrology, weather, fuels, or fire
behavior. The ground rule is to use common sense
when applying these guidelines. If conservation mea-
sures or actual State-mandated Best Management
Practices are to be used, it is important to clearly
communicate objectives and goals at briefings and on
operational period fire plans. Assistance from staff
hydrologists and soil scientists is also crucial in
successfully applying these water quality protection
guidelines.

Install grades, ditches, and water bars while the line is being constructed.
12
Install water bars on any fireline running up-down slope, and direct runoff onto
a filter strip or sideslope, not into a drainage.
13
Construct firelines at a grade of 10 percent or less where possible.
14
Adequately cross-ditch all firelines at time of construction.
15
Construct simple diversion ditches or turnouts at intervals as needed to direct
surface runoff off a plowed line and onto undisturbed forest floor or

16
Construct firelines only as deep and wide as necessary to control the spread
of the fire.

Summary ______________________
When a wildland fire occurs, the principal concerns
for change in water quality are: (1) the introduction of
sediment; (2) the potential increasing nitrates, espe-
cially if the foliage being burned is in an area chronic
atmospheric deposition; (3) the possible introduction
of heavy metals from soils and geologic sources within
the burned area; and (4) the introduction of fire retar-
dant chemicals into streams that can reach levels toxic
to aquatic organisms.
The magnitude of the effects of fire on water quality
is primarily driven by fire severity, and not necessarily
by fire intensity. Fire severity is a qualitative term
describing the amount of fuel consumed, while fire
intensity is a quantitative measure of the rate of heat
release (see chapter 1). In other words, the more severe
the fire, the greater the amount of fuel consumed and
nutrients released, and the more susceptible the site is
to erosion of soil and nutrients into the stream where
they could potentially affect water quality. Wildfires
usually are more severe than prescribed fires. As a
result, they are more likely to produce significant
effects on water quality. On the other hand, prescribed
fires are designed to be less severe and would be
expected to produce less effect on water quality. Use of
prescribed fire allows the manager the opportunity to
control the severity of the fire and to avoid creating
large areas burned at high severity. The degree of fire
severity is also related to the vegetation type. For
example, in grasslands the differences between pre-
scribed fire and wildfire are probably small. In for-
ested environments, the magnitude of the effects of
fire on water quality will probably be much lower after
a prescribed fire than after a wildfire because of the
larger amount of fuel consumed in a wildfire. We
expect canopy-consuming wildfires to be the greatest
concern to managers because of the loss of canopy
coupled with the destruction of soil aggregates. These
losses present the worst-case scenario in terms of
water quality. The differences between wild and pre-
scribed fire in shrublands are probably intermediate
between those seen in grass and forest environments.
Another important determinant of the magnitude of
the effects of fire on water quality is slope. Steepness
of the slope has a significant influence on movement of
soil and nutrients into stream channels where it can
affect water quality. Wright and others (1976) found
that as slope increased in a prescribed fire, erosion
from slopes accelerated. If at all possible, the vegeta-
tive canopy on steep, erodible slopes needs to be
maintained, particularly if adequate streamside
buffer strips do not exist to trap the large amounts of
sediment and nutrients that could be transported
quickly into the stream channel. It is important to
maintain streamside buffer strips whenever possible,
especially when developing prescribed fire plans. These
buffer strips will capture much of the sediment and
nutrients from burned upslope areas.
Nitrogen is of concern to water quality. If soils on a
particular site are close to N saturation, it is possible
to exceed maximum contamination levels of NO3-N
(10 ppm or 10 mg/L) after a severe fire. Such areas
should not have N-containing fertilizer applied after
the fire. Review chapter 3 for more discussion of N.
Fire retardants typically contain large amounts of N,
and they can cause water quality problems where
drops are made close to streams.
The propensity for a site to develop water repellency
after fire must be considered (see chapter 2). Water-
repellent soils do not allow precipitation to penetrate
down into the soil and therefore are conducive to
erosion. Severe fires on such sites can put large amounts
of sediment and nutrients into surface water.
Finally, heavy rain on recently burned land can
seriously degrade water quality. Severe erosion and
runoff are not limited to wildfire sites alone. But if
postfire storms deliver large amounts of precipitation
or short-duration high intensity rainfalls, accelerated
erosion and runoff can occur even after a carefully
planned prescribed fire. Conversely, if below-average
precipitation occurs after a wildfire, there may not be
a substantial increase in erosion and runoff and no
effect on water quality.
Fire managers can influence the effects of fire on
water quality by careful planning before prescribed
burning. Limiting fire severity, avoiding burning on
steep slopes, and limiting burning on potentially wa-
ter-repellent soils will reduce the magnitude of the
effects of fire on water quality.

Fire Effects on Fish ______________
Prior to the 1990s, little information existed on the
effects of wildfire on fishes and their habitats (fig. 7.1).
Severson and Rinne (1988) reported that most of the
focus of fire effects on riparian-stream ecosystems—
that is, habitat for fishes—was on hydrological and
erosional responses to vegetation removal and re-
sultant effects on sedimentation and water quality.
Most of these studies were conducted in the 1970s
(Anderson 1976, Tiedemann and others 1978) and
examined water quality and quantity effects, algae,
and aquatic micro- and macroinvertebrates. Accord-
ingly, they addressed the potential “indirect effects”
of fire on fishes; none addressed the “direct effects” of
fire on fishes.
The Yellowstone Fires in 1988 ushered in an exten-
sive effort to examine both the direct and indirect
effects of wildfire on aquatic ecosystems (Minshall and
others 1989, Minshall and Brock1991). Other studies
on fishes were conducted following some of the histori-
cally worst wildfires in the Southwestern United States

(Rinne 1996, Rinne and Neary 1996). The result is that
most of the information available on fire effects on
fishes and their habitats has been generated in the
1990s and on a regional basis. By the late 1990s,
summary and review papers on the topic of fire and
aquatic ecosystem, including fishes, were drafted
(Reiman and Clayton 1997, Gresswell 1999), which
brought 20th century information together and sug-
gested future research and management direction for
both corroborating aquatics-fisheries and fire man-
agement and conservation of native, sensitive species
(fig. 7.2). This state-of-our-knowledge documentation
is what we use to base 21st century fisheries and
aquatic management relative to both wild and pre-
scription fires.
Because of the increased number, size, and intensity
of fires commencing in 2000 in the Western and South-
western United States, we now see a marked increase
in data describing the impact of post-wildfire events
on fishes (Rinne and Carter, in press, Rinne 2003a,b).
While before the turn of the century we had informa-
tion on fire effects on salmonid species only, now the
data base includes a dozen native fish species and
several nonnative fish species (table 7.1). Key mes-
sages from these data are discussed below.
Direct Fire Effects
Fire can result in immediate mortalities to fishes,
but few studies have documented direct mortality
following wildfire (McMahon and de Calesta 1990,
Minshall and Brock 1991, Reiman and others 1997).
High severity fire and heavy fuel and slash accumula-
tions in the riparian zone are the common predispos-
ing factors for direct fish mortality. Moring and Lantz
(1975) found some fish mortality after prescribed fire
conducted after harvesting in the Alsea Basin of
Oregon. The fish kill was confined to stream heads
where slash accumulations were heavy and the pre-
scribed fire reached levels of high severity. Rinne
(1996) found no significant reduction in densities of
fishes in three streams as a direct result of a large fire
(Dude Fire, Arizona, 1990) that burned across the
watersheds encompassing them. Although the Dude
Fire had large areas of high severity fire, many of the
riparian areas either suffered only low severity fire or
did not burn at all. Reiman and others (1997) reported
both dead fish and reaches of stream with no live fish
after a high severity fire burned through two riparian
corridors in Idaho. On the other hand, no mortalities
of the endangered Gila trout were reported immedi-
ately after the Divide Fire in southwestern New Mexico
(Propst and others 1992).
Key factors in immediate postfire fish mortality are
the size of the riparian area, the riparian fuel load, fire
severity, and stream size. Small streams with high
fuel loads and high severity fire are the ones most
likely to suffer immediate aquatic organism mortality
from fire.
Fire retardants can also be a source of fish mortality
(chapter 6 this volume, Van Meter and Hardy 1975).
Dead fish have been reported following fire retardant
application (Jones and others 1989); however, docu-
mentation is poor (Norris and Webb 1989). The num-
ber of retardant drops and orientation to the stream
are key factors determining fish mortality.
Indirect Fire Effects
The indirect effects of large fires on fishes are better
documented and can be significant (Reiman and
Clayton 1997). Within 2 weeks after the Divide Fire in
New Mexico, a single Gila trout was collected from
Main Diamond Creek. Sampling 3 months later sug-
gested extirpation of this endangered species from this
headwater stream (Rinne and Neary 1996). Similarly,
Rinne (1996) reported dead fishes on streambanks 2
weeks postfire and documented only a single brook
trout at spring outflow in Dude Creek remaining 3
months after the Dude Fire. In both cases, “slurry ash
flows” appeared responsible for fish mortality within
onset of summer monsoons and basically local extirpa-
tion after several months of sustaining flooding of
stream corridors resulting from heavy monsoon pre-
cipitation and vegetation removal (fig. 7.3).
Rinne and Carter (in press a) documented the com-
plete loss of four species and more than 2,000 indi-
vidual fishes from the fire impacted reaches of Ponil
Creek, New Mexico, following the Ponil Complex 2002
wildfire (table 7.2). Drought conditions and stream
intermittency combined with ash and flood flows syn-
ergistically resulted in this total loss of fishes (Rinne
in press b). By comparison, postfire ash and flood flows

in Rio Medio, New Mexico, following the Borrego Fire,
reduced brown trout Salmo trutta populations by 70
percent from June to October 2002 (table 7.3). Simi-
larly, six native cypriniform (minnow and sucker)
species were reduced 70 percent in the West Fork of
the Gila River following the Cub Mountain Fire
(table 7.4). Both of these streams had summer, base-
flushing flows that apparently diluted the impacts of
ash and flood flows from July to October 2002 and
enabled fishes to survive in fire-impacted reaches of
the river. In 2003, the Picture Fire in Arizona im-
pacted three streams and six species of fishes (includ-
ing three native species). It markedly altered stream
habitat on the Tonto National Forest (Carter and
Rinne in press). Overall, fish numbers were reduced
by 90 percent (fig. 7.4). Finally, two fires, the Lake
Complex in New Mexico and the Aspen Fire in Ari-
zona, probably resulted in total loss of the endangered
Gila chub (Gila intermedia) in two streams. In
summary, short-term data suggest from 70 percent to
total loss of fishes in wildfire-impacted reaches of
streams in the Southwest (Rinne 2003a,b).
Bozek and Young (1994) noted mortalities of four
species of salmonids 2 years postfire following heavy
precipitation and flooding on a burned watershed in
Wyoming. Death was attributed to the increase in
suspended sediment loading. In Montana and Idaho,
Novak and White (1989) reported that flooding and
debris flows extirpated fish from stream reaches below
forest fires
Other Anthropogenic Influencing Factors
Watershed disturbances have occurred on the land-
scapes of National Forests for the past century. Roads
to support timber harvest, timber harvest itself, and
grazing of watersheds have cumulatively disturbed
and altered watersheds. Dams, diversions, and road
culverts, in concert with introduction of nonnative
species of fishes, have fragmented and isolated native
fish populations (Rinne 2003a,b). Fire suppression
itself has greatly altered the vegetative and litter
component of forested landscapes (Covington and
Moore 1992, Covington and others 1994), increasing
tree densities and litter loads. These combined have
facilitated intense crowning fires that can be more
devastating to fishes and aquatic habitats (Rinne and
Neary 1996).
Temporal-Spatial Scales
Most fires that burn on the landscape are less than
several acres (1 ha) in size because they are normally
suppressed through fire management. By compari-
son, only 1 percent of the wildfires are responsible for
more than 90 percent of the landscaped burned
(DeBano and others 1998). Most studies of the effects
of fire on fishes and aquatic systems are of short term
(less than 5 years) (Gresswell 1999). Although at-
tempts have been made to extrapolate the effects of
fire on aquatic systems and organisms to a watershed
scale, this in reality has not been achieved to date
(Gresswell 1999). Attempts to connect the effects of
fire 25 to 50 years previous have been made (Rinne and
Neary 1996, Rinne 2003a,b, Albin 1979) but are want-
ing at best. Sampling of two streams impacted by the
Dude Fire (1990), a decade after the fire, suggests
impacts of fire on stream fish populations may be

chronic (fig. 7.5). Further, attempting to simplify these
effects in time and space is not advisable.
Species Considerations
Recovery of fishes to a stream can occur quickly
depending on connectivity of populations and refugia
populations to replenish locally extirpated popula-
tions (Propst and others 1992, Reiman and Clayton
1997, Gresswell 1999, Rinne and Calamusso in press).
In the Southwest, fragmentation of streams as a
result of land uses, coupled with fisheries manage-
ment such as the introduction of nonnative fishes,
most often preclude access and replenishing of fishes
to a fire-extirpated stream. A big consideration is
whether the species is a threatened or endangered
one, such as the Gila trout in the Southwest or the
Bull or redband trout in the Pacific Northwest. These
cases may necessitate quick removal of surviving fishes
prior to ash flows or intense flooding resulting from
watershed denudation. In case of put and take, intro-
duced sport fishes, these can always be replenished
through stocking. Managers should be vigilant of
opportunities to restore native stocks or races of
fishes to streams where introduced species have been
removed through the aftermath of wildfire. This has
been successfully completed for the Gila trout in
Dude Creek a decade after extirpation of a brook
trout population by the Dude Fire of 1990.
Summary and General Management
Implications for Fish
The effects of wildland fire on fish are mostly indi-
rect, with most studies demonstrating the effects of
ash flows, changes in hydrologic regimes, and in-
creases in suspended sediment on fishes. These im-
pacts are marked, ranging from 70 percent to total loss
of fishes. There are some documented instances of
fires killing fish directly (Reiman and others 1997).
The largest problems arise from the longer term
impact on habitat that includes changes in stream
temperature due to plant understory and overstory
removal, ash-laden slurry flows, increases in flood
peakflows, and sedimentation due to increased land-
scape erosion (fig. 7.6).
Most of information on the effects of wildfire on
fishes has been generated since about 1990. The
Yellowstone Fires of 1988 resulted in extensive study
of fire effects on aquatic ecosystems including fishes.
The effects of fire retardants on fishes are observa-
tional and not well documented. Further, all informa-
tion is from forested biomes as opposed to grasslands.
Anthropogenic influences, largely land use activi-
ties over the past century, cumulatively influence fire

effects on fishes. Fire suppression alone has affected
vegetation densities on the landscape, and affected the
severity and extent of wildfire and, in turn, its effects
on aquatic ecosystems and fishes. Most studies of fire
effects on fishes are short term (less than 5 years) and
local in nature. A landscape approach to analyses has
not been made to date. Fish can recover rapidly from
population reductions or loss but can be markedly
limited or precluded by loss of stream connectivity
because of human-induced barriers. Fisheries man-
agement postfire should be based on species and fish-
eries and their management status. Managers should
be vigilant of opportunities to restore native fishes in
event of removal of introduced, nonnative, translo-
cated species.
Recent advances in atmospheric, marine, and ter-
restrial ecosystem science have resulted in the corre-
lation of ocean temperature oscillations, tree ring
data, and drought. These newer advances, along with
current information on fire effects on fishes and data
on climate change, drought, and recent insect infesta-
tions, all combine to show that the greatest impacts on
fish may lie ahead. For example, new climate change
analyses suggest that the Southeastern and parts of
the Western United States have a high probability of
continuing and future drought into the next 20 to 30
years, and that the potential impact of wildfire on
fishes in the Southwest is marked. Also, the overarching
global indicators are starting to unfold: tree ring data
indicate 2002 was the driest year in the past 1,000
years (Service 2004); Atlantic and Pacific oceanic
temperatures are in turn correlated with historic wet
and dry cycles.
The cumulative impacts of warmer and drier cli-
mate, with increasing insect outbreaks at higher and
higher elevations, will potentially increase the risk of
wildfire throughout the ranges of Southwestern na-
tive fishes (fig. 7.7). Such impacts increase the future
risk of loss of fish gene pools and Southwestern native
fishes’ sustainability.
Birds __________________________
The effects of fires on bird populations are covered in
volume 1 of this series (Effects of Fire on Fauna, Smith
2000). Aquatic areas and wetlands often provide refu-
gia during fires. However, wetlands such as cienegas,
marshes, cypress swamps, spruce and larch swamps,
and so forth do burn under the right conditions. The
impacts of fires on individual birds and populations in
wetlands would then depend upon the season, unifor-
mity, and severity of burning (Smith 2000).
Reptiles and Amphibians _________
The effects of fires on reptile and amphibian popula-
tions are also covered in volume 1 of this series (Effects
of Fire on Fauna, Smith 2000). Russell and others
(1999) concluded that there are few reports of fire-
caused injury to herpetofauna in general, much less
aquatic and wetland species. They noted that aquatic
and semiaquatic herpetofauna benefit from wetland
fires due to vegetation structure improvement and
increases in the surface area of open water. Excessive
postfire sedimentation of streams or small standing
bodies of water could potentially reduce habitat for
reptile and amphibian populations. However, the ef-
fects are not well documented.
Mammals ______________________
Aquatic and wetland dwelling mammals are usually
not adversely impacted by fires due to animal mobility
and the lower frequency of fires in these areas. Lyon
and others (2000a,b) discuss factors such as fire uni-
formity, size, duration, and severity that affect mam-
mals. However, most of their discussion relates to
terrestrial mammals, not aquatic and wetland ones.
Aquatic and wetland habitats also provide safety zones
for mammals during fires.
Invertebrates ___________________
The fauna volume in this series deals mainly with
terrestrial invertebrates (Smith 2000). As with fishes,
little information existed on the effects of wildfire on
aquatic macroinvertebrates prior to 1980, although
some studies were conducted in the 1970s (Anderson
Figure 7.6—Four-Corners Fire encroaching on a lake
near Crane Prairie, Oregon. (Photo by Tom Iraci).

1976). Tiedemann and others (1978) examined water
quality and quantity effects, algae, and aquatic micro-
and macroinvertebrates. As with fishes, these studies
addressed the potential “indirect effects” of fire on
aquatic macroinvertebrates rather than any “direct
effects.”
Parallel with information generation on fishes, the
Yellowstone Fires in 1988 ushered in an extensive
effort to examine both the direct and indirect effects of
wildfire on aquatic ecosystems (Minshall and others
1989, Minshall and Brock 1991). Isolated studies on
aquatic macroinvertebrates have been conducted fol-
lowing some of the historically worst wildfires in the
Southwestern United States (Rinne 1996). By the late
1990s, a summary and review paper on the topic of fire
and aquatic ecosystems, including aquatic
macroinvertebrates, was produced (Gresswell 1999).
As for fishes, the Gresswell paper is the state-of-the-art

invertebrates, collates a comprehensive review of infor-
mation from the 20th century, and suggests future
research and management direction.
Response to Fire
Similar to fishes, the direct effects of fire on
macroinvertebrates have not been observed or re-
ported. Albin (1979) reported no change in aquatic
macro invertebrates abundance during and after fire
and no dead macroinvertebrates observable. Rinne
(1996) could not document any changes in mean
aquatic macroinvertebrate density in three head-
water streams from prefire to immediately follow-
ing the then-worst wildfire Arizona history, the
Dude Fire (table 7.5). However, sampling after initial
“ash slurry flows” (in the 2 weeks postfire) revealed an

greatly increase the risk of wildfire and further the marked loss of native fishes.

80 to 90 percent reduction in mean densities. Further
sampling after several significant flood events deter-
mined that macroinvertebrate populations were near
zero. Sampling over the next 2 years revealed dra-
matic fluctuations in density and diversity (number of
species) of macroinvertebrates in all three streams.
In general, responses to fire by aquatic macro-
invertebrates, as with fishes, are indirect and vary
widely in response. Studies in the 1970s by Lotspeich
and others (1970) and Stefan (1977) suggested the
effects of fire were minimal or undetectable. La Point
and others (1996) also reported no difference in
macroinvertebrate distribution in streams encom-
passed by burned and unburned sites nor shifts in
water chemistry. Changes in functional feeding groups
(Cummins 1978) by aquatic macroinvertebrates have
been noted and attributed to substrate stability differ-
ences between fire impacted and nonimpacted streams.
By comparison, Richards and Minshall (1992) re-
ported that in the first 5 years postfire, macro-
invertebrate diversity in streams affected by fire
exhibited greater annual variation in diversity than in
unaffected streams. Annual fluctuations or variation
in diversity did decline with time; however, greater
species richness was sustained in streams within
burned areas.
As indicated in the introduction, the Yellowstone
Fires provided an opportunity to study the effects of
fire on aquatic ecosystems and to generate most of the
available information on aquatic macroinvertebrate
response to fire. In the first year postfire, minor
declines in macroinvertebrate abundances, species
richness, and diversity were recorded (Robinson and
others 1994, Lawrence and Minshall 1994, Minshall
and others 1995, Mihuc and others 1996). Two years
postfire, these indices had increased but less so in
smaller order streams (Minshall and others 1997).
Food supply, in the form of unburned coarse particu-
late material, was suggested to be the factor most
important to macroinvertebrates.
Jones and others (1993) reported macroinvertebrate
abundance fluctuations in four larger (fifth and sixth
order streams) in Yellowstone National Park, yet
species diversity and richness did not decline. A change
in functional feeding groups from shredder-collector
species to scraper-filter feeding species occurred (Jones
and others 1993).
Temporally, the effects of fire on macroinvertebrates
can be sustained for up to a decade (Roby 1989) or
possibly longer (greater than three decades; Albin
1979). Roby and Azuma (1995) studied changes in
benthic macroinvertebrate diversity in two streams
after a wildfire in northern California (fig. 7.8).

Invertebrate diversity, density, and taxa richness in
the stream of the burned watershed were low imme-
diately after the fire compared to the unburned water-
shed. Within 3 years, mean density was significantly
higher in the burned watershed (fig. 7.9). A decade
after the wildfire, taxa richness and species diversity
were still lower in the stream of the burned water-
shed. Albin (1979) reported lower diversity of
macroinvertebrates in reference compared to streams
in burned areas. Macroinvertebrate density also was
greater in burned streams; however, Chironomidae
(immature midges adapted to disturbed areas char-
acterized by fine sediments) were the most abundant
group represented in samples. Mihuc and others
(1996) suggested changes in physical habitat and
availability of food supply are the primary factors
affecting postfire response of individual macro-
invertebrate populations.
Invertebrate Summary
Similar to fishes, the recorded effects of fire on
aquatic macroinvertebrates are indirect as opposed
to direct. Most data have been produced during and
since the 1990s. Regarding abundance, diversity, or
richness, response varies from minimal to no changes,
and from considerable to significant changes. Abun-
dance of macroinvertebrates may actually increase
in fire-affected streams, but diversity generally is
reduced. These differences are undoubtedly related
to landscape variability, burn size and severity, stream
size, nature and timing of postfire flooding events,
and postfire time. Temporally, changes in macro-
invertebrate indices in the first 5 years postfire can
be different from ensuing years, and long-term (10 to
30 years) effects have been suggested.

Chapters 8 through 11 in this part of the volume deal
with special topics that were not considered in the
original “Rainbow Series” on the effects of fire on soils
(Wells and others 1979) and water (Tiedemann and
others 1979). These topics include wetlands and ripar-
ian ecosystems, fire effects models and soil erosion
models, the Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation
(BAER) program with its various treatments and
results, and information sources such as databases,
Web sites, journals, books, and so forth. Part C con-
cludes with the References section and an appendix of
glossary terms.
Wetlands science has advanced considerably since
the original “Rainbow Series” was published in 1979,
and the role of fire in wetlands ecosystems is now
understood more completely. Tiedemann and others
(1979) briefly discussed everglades wetlands of south-
ern Florida and cypress wetlands of northern Florida.
Chapter 8 of this volume recognizes the extent of
wetlands in North America beyond the swamps of
Florida. The authors go into considerable detail on the
effects of fire in wetlands and their associated riparian
areas.
Fire effects models and soil erosion models were in
their infancy in the mid 1970s, and researchers and
land managers then only dreamed of the compact,
high speed desktop and laptop computers we now have
that are able to do the millions of calculations needed

to run these models. Chapter 9 briefly examines how
these models increase our understanding of the ef-
fects of fire on soils and water. While this discussion
is not intended as inclusive of the complete scope of fire
effects models, we do intend to illustrate some of the
more commonly available ones.
Rehabilitation of burned landscapes has long been
recognized as a necessary step for healing severely
burned watersheds to reduce erosion and mitigate
adverse changes in hydrology. However, the BAER
program did not start until the mid 1970s and was not
initially well organized nor well understood. Chapter
10 provides a much needed synopsis of the BAER
program based on a Robichaud and others (2000)
literature and research review publication.
The numbers of textbooks, research reports, journal
articles, users guides, and databases with specific
focus on wildland fire have rapidly increased in the
past quarter century. And now in the 21st century, we
have readily accessible sources of fire effects informa-
tion such as databases and Web sites that did not exist
in the 1970s. The Web sites facilitate rapid dissemina-
tion of fire effects information to managers, research-
ers, and the general public. Their use and importance
will continue to grow. Chapter 11 details these infor-
mation sources.
Chapter 12 is an overall summary of this volume and
contains suggestions for research needs and priorities.

Introduction ____________________
Wetlands and riparian ecosystems contain biotic
communities that develop because of the regular pres-
ence of water (Brooks and others 2003). Undisturbed
or well-managed wetlands and riparian ecosystems
provide benefits that are proportionally much more
important compared to the relatively small portion of
the land area that they occupy because these ecosys-
tems support a diversity of plants and animals that
are not found elsewhere. Wetlands and riparian eco-
systems also play important roles relating to en-
hanced water quality, flood peak attenuation, and
reduced erosion and sediment transport. At the same
time, these ecosystems are often fragile and often
easily disturbed, and both wildfires and prescribed
burns can affect the soil, water, litter, and vegetation
in wetlands and riparian ecosystems.
Although the terms “wetland” and “riparian” are
sometimes used interchangeably, it is important to
distinguish between the two systems both ecologically
and in terms of their individual responses to fire.
While the presence of water is an essential feature of
both ecosystems, wetlands are more typically repre-
sented by large accumulations of surface organic mat-
ter that are waterlogged for long periods during the

Systems
year, producing persistent anaerobic soil conditions;
riparian areas, on the other hand, are characterized
more as communities of water obligate plants that are
typically found along river systems where moisture is
readily available but the soils are saturated for only
short periods. These differences in morphology and
hydric environment strongly affect the type of fire that
burns in each ecosystem. When the water table is low
in wetlands, surface and crown fires often ignite smol-
dering grond fires in think layers of humus, peat, and
muck when the resulting in deep depth of burn. Con-
versely, when the water table is high, fires exhibit low
depth of burn regardless of the fireline intensity. In
riparian areas fires often back down hill at low
intensity leaving irregular mixed severity burns.
Periodically, however, riparian areas experience high
intensity crown fires due to the high fuel continuity
and the chimney effect of the terrain. Thus mixed
severity fire regimes are common in wetland and
riparian communities.
Wetlands ______________________
Wetlands are widely distributed from tropical to
arctic regions and found in both arid and humid envi-
ronments. They cover approximately 4 to 6 percent

150
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
of Earth’s land area and display a broad ecological
range with characteristics of both aquatic and terres-
trial ecosystems (Mitsch and Gosselink 1993). The
wide distribution and diversity of wetlands make
forming generalizations and widely adaptable man-
agement solutions difficult (Lugo 1995) (fig. 8.1).
Wetland functions are crucial to environmental
quality. They supply the habitat requirements for a
diverse range of plants, animals, and other organ-
isms, some of which are threatened and endangered.
Wetlands regulate water quality and quantity and
are an integral element of global climate control.
Improved understanding of wetlands and the rela-
tionship between fire and wetlands has become in-
creasingly important for a number of reasons, includ-
ing concerns about wetland habitat loss, global
warming, toxic metal accumulation, and the treat-
ment of hazardous fuels.
While the connection between wetlands and fire
appears tenuous, fire plays an integral role in the
creation and persistence of wetland species and eco-
systems. Changes in climate and vegetation are re-
corded in the deposition of macrofossils, pollen, and
peat, and disturbances such as fire are also recorded
in this depositional record (Jasieniuk and Johnson
1982, Cohen and others 1984, Kuhry and Vitt 1996).
Paleoecological evidence of fire is derived from a
number of sources including pollen analysis and
charcoal distribution. Charcoal, which is produced
when plant materials are pyrolized, is a record of the
influence of fire on the structure of ecosystems (Cope
and Chaloner 1985). The distribution of pollen and
charcoal within wetland soils reflect both fire history
and environmental conditions (Kuhry 1994).
Paleoecological studies show consistent evidence of
frequent fire in a wide distribution of wetlands from
the Southeastern United States to the boreal regions
of Canada and Alaska. For example, peat cores from
the Okefenokee Swamp in Georgia exhibited distinct
charcoal bands indicating a fire history (Cohen and
others 1984, Hermann and others 1991). Patterns in
pollen and charcoal distribution in Wisconsin and
Minnesota wetlands show changes that reflect varia-
tion in environmental conditions and fire frequency
(Davis 1979, Clark 1998). Trees from mires of north-
ern Minnesota show fire scars as evidence of fire
history (Glaser and others 1981). In boreal regions,
peat sediments from sphagnum-dominated wetlands
show a fire history as distinct charcoal layers and
pollen changes (Kuhry 1994).

Wetland and Hydric Soil Classification
Not only are there a confusing number of terms and
definitions to describe organic soils and organic mat-
ter while classifying wetlands (table 8.1), but during
the past three decades several new wetland classifica-
tion systems have been developed and used by various
government agencies. This array of classification sys-
tems reflects both our understanding of wetland pro-
cesses and the missions of the individual agencies.
The system developed and currently in use by the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Cowardin and others
1979; table 8.2) for wetland inventory is well suited for
ecological applications (Mitsch and Gosselink 1993).
In this classification system, the divisions between the
five wetland systems are based on hydrologic similari-
ties in the water source and flow. Wetland systems of
interest to fire managers in this classification include:
•
Lacustrine wetlands, which are associated
with lakes and reservoirs.
•
Riverine wetlands, which are associated with
flowing water of rivers.
•
Estuarine wetlands, which include salt
marshes.
•
Palustrine wetlands, which include swamps,
bogs, fens and other common freshwater
wetlands.
Table 8.1—Terms and definitions used to describe organic soils and organic matter (Adapted from Soil
Science Society of America 1997, and Mitsch and Gosselink 1993).
Term
Definitions
Bog
A peat-accumulating wetland that has no significant inflows and supports acidophilic
mosses, particularly sphagnum.
Fen
A peat-accumulating wetland that receives some drainage from surrounding mineral
soils and usually supports marsh-like vegetation. These areas are richer in nutrients
and less acidic than bogs. The soils under fens are peat (Histosol) if the fen has
been present for a while.
Fibric
A type of organic soil where less than one-third of the material is decomposed, and
more than two-thirds of plant fibers are identifiable.
Marsh
A frequently or continually inundated wetland characterized by emergent herbaceous
vegetation adapted to saturated soil conditions.
Muck
Organic soil material in which the original plant remains is not recognizable. Contains
more mineral matter and is usually darker in color than peat.
Muskeg
Large expanses of peatlands or bogs; particularly used in Canada and Alaska.
Oligotrophic
Describes a body of water (for example, a lake) with a poor supply of nutrients and a
low rate of formation of organic matter by phototsynthesis.
Ombrotrophic
True raised bogs that have developed peat layers higher than their surroundings and
which receive nutrients and other minerals exclusively by precipitation.
Peat
Organic soil materials in which the original plant remains are recognizable (fibric
material).
Peatlands
A generic term for any wetland that accumulated partially decayed plant matter.
Pocosin
Temperate zone evergreen shrub bogs dominated by pond pine, ericaceous shrubs,
and sphagnum.
Sapric
Type of organic soil where two-thirds or more of the material is decomposed, and
less than one-third of plant fibers are identifiable.
Wet
Grassland with waterlogged soil near the surface but without standing water most
meadow
of the year.
Wet
Similar to marsh but with water levels usually intermediate between a marsh and a
prairie
wet meadow.

At a finer level, the division of wetland systems and
subsystems into wetland classes is based upon the
dominant vegetation type or substrate. The major
wetland classes of interest in this system include:
•
Forested
•
Scrub-shrub
•
Emergent
•
Moss-lichen
Wetland classes are further modified by factors
including water regime, water chemistry, and soil
factors.
In addition to unique vegetation and hydrologic
characteristics, wetlands are also distinguished by the
presence of hydric soils. The definition of hydric soils
has evolved during the last few decades, and the
changes to the definition reflect our increased under-
standing of wetland soils genesis (Richardson and
Vepraskas 2001). Although organic soils (Histisols)
are commonly associated with wetlands, poorly drained
mineral soils with wet moisture regimes are also
common on wetland sites. An additional soil order has
recently been added to the U.S soil classification
system (Gelisols). This new soil order reflects the
influence of low temperatures and soil moisture on
soil processes. Thus, wetland soils of the boreal
peatlands are now classified as Gelisols (Bridgham
and others 2001).
The current definition of hydric soils includes both
histisols and mineral soils (table 8.3). The primary
factor contributing to the differences between hydric
and nonwetland soils is the presence of a water table
Table 8.2—U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service classification hierarchy of wetland and deepwater
habitats (Cowardin and others 1979). These are wetland classes of particular
interest to fire management. Wetlands are shown in bold print.

close to the soil surface or frequent long-duration
flooding or ponding. The oxygen-limiting conditions
found in these waterlogged environments affect micro-
and macrofaunal organisms and nutrient cycling pro-
cesses and result in decreased decomposition rates
and different metabolic end products (Stevenson 1986).
Wetland Hydrology and Fire
Wetland hydrology is a complex cycle of water in-
flows and outflows that are balanced by the interrela-
tionships between biotic and abiotic factors. The pres-
ence and movement of water are dominant factors
controlling wetland dynamics, nutrient and energy
flow, soil chemistry, organic matter decomposition,
and plant and animal community composition.
Wetland systems are characterized by annual water
budgets comprising storage, precipitation, evapotrans-
piration, interception, and surface and ground water
components. In addition to water budgets, the season-
ality and movement of water is characterized by
hydroperiod and hydrodynamics. Hydroperiod is the
time a soil is saturated or flooded, and results from
water table movements caused by distinct seasonal
changes in the balance between inflows and outflows
of a particular wetland. Hydrodynamics is the move-
ment of water in wetlands and is an important process
affecting soil nutrients and productivity.
Alteration of ground water levels and flow induced
by anthropogenic activities such as ditching and fire
line construction is a serious concern in wetland fire
management (Bacchus 1995). Long-term changes in
hydroperiod or hydrodynamics affect productivity,
decomposition, fuel accumulation, and the subsidence
of organic soils. Changes in these wetland characteris-
tics lead to changes in fire behavior and ground fire
potential.
Water budgets, hydroperiods, and hydrodynamics
are unique for each wetland type and, as a result, have
substantial effect on site productivity and decomposi-
tion rates (Mitsch and Gosselink 1993). Significant
ground and surface water inputs are characteristic of
the water budgets of marshes and fens, while precipi-
tation and evapotranspiration dominate the water
budgets of bogs and pocosins. The timing and pattern
of these inputs has a distinct influence on fire occur-
rence. For example, the water budget of pocosin eco-
systems in the Southeastern United States is domi-
nated by rainfall and evapotranspiration with minor
surface and ground water components. Typically, the
highest wildfire danger occurs between March and
May because the evapotranspiration rate is higher
than precipitation, thereby causing a water deficit in
these soils (fig. 8.2).
In contrast to the pocosin wetlands, in the boreal
black spruce/feather moss wetlands, frozen soil re-
stricts drainage during spring and early summer, and
the organic soil retains a higher percentage of water.
Typically, soil drying in these communities is delayed
until in June or July (Foster 1983). Early season fires
in these wetlands consume little organic soil material,
while fires later in the season or during extended
droughts can consume significant amounts of organic
soil material (Heinselman 1981, Johnson 1992,
Duchesne and Hawkes 2000, Kasischke and Stocks
2000).
Although studies have identified interrelationships
among hydrology, fire, and soil in wetland esosystems
(Kologiski 1977, Sharitz and Gibbons 1982, Frost
1995), the codominant influence of fire and hydrology
is not clear. Hydrologic characteristics influence fire
severity, and in turn the fire severity influences
postburn hydrology and future fire severity. Both

these factors also affect numerous ecological variables
including soil moisture, soil aeration, and soil tem-
perature regime. The separation of disturbance effects
from hydrological effects is difficult because wetland
response to disturbance is a function of changes in
numerous spatial and temporal gradients (Trettin
and others 1996).
Wetland community responses to fire frequency,
hydroperiod, and organic soil depth were investigated
in a North Carolina pocosin (scrub-shrub wetland). The
results showed that emergent sedge bogs on deep or-
ganic soils with long hydroperiods were associated with
frequent fires. Deciduous bay forest communities with
shallower organic soils and shorter hydroperiods were
associated with decreases in fire frequency, while pine
savanna communities with shallow organic soils and
short hydroperiods were associated with a decrease in
fire frequency (Kologiski 1977) (fig. 8.3). A similar
relationship between fire and hydroperiod was found in
a study of Florida cypress domes communities. Emer-
gent/persistent wetlands with long hydroperiods were
associated with frequent fires, while forested alluvial
wetlands with shorter hydroperiods were associated
with infrequent fires (Ewel 1990) (fig. 8.4).
Fire regimes are representative of long-term pat-
terns in the severity and occurrence of fires (Brown
2000). They reflect the interdependence of several
factors including climate, fuel accumulation, and igni-
tion sources. Several fire regime classification sys-
tems have been developed using fire characteristics or
effects produced by the fire (Agee 1993, Brown 2000).
Wetland fire regimes vary in frequency and severity.
Light, frequent fires maintain the herbaceous vegeta-
tion in emergent meadows such as tidal marshes and
sedge meadows (Frost 1995) (fig. 8.5). Light surface
fires in Carex stricta dominated sedge meadows re-
move surface litter and resulted in increased forb
germination and species diversity (Warners 1997).
Infrequent stand-replacing fires are needed to regen-
erate Atlantic white cedar and black spruce/feather
moss forested wetlands (Kasischke and Stocks 2000).
Surface fires associated with high water table condi-
tions reduce shrub and grass cover and produce condi-
tions favorable for Atlantic white cedar germination
and survival (Laderman 1989). Experimental results
have shown that when the organic soil horizons in
black spruce/feather moss wetlands are removed by
surface fires, the resulting elevated nutrient levels

Fuel accumulation in wetlands is a function of pro-
ductivity and decomposition. Productivity is a func-
tion of hydroperiod and hydrodynamics, which regu-
late the inflows and outflows of water, nutrients, and
oxygen. The seasonal or temporary flooding that is
common in tidal marshes and alluvial forest wetlands

provides external inputs of water and nutrients and
results in high productivity and high decomposition
rates. In contrast, the long, stable hydroperiod and
dependence on precipitation for water and nutrients
common in bogs, pocosins, and other nutrient-limited
wetlands result in lower productivity and slower de-
composition rates.
On the nutrient-limited wetlands with long, stable
hydroperiods, greater amounts of fuel accumulate
because of slower decomposition rates in the relatively
nutrient-poor litter and fine fuels. This slower decom-
position rate leads to more frequent fires on the nutri-
ent-limited sites compared to the productive sites that
have inherently less litter and fuels production
(Christensen 1985).
Surface Fire in Wetlands—In wetland soils, the
effects produced by surface and ground fires are re-
lated to the intensity and duration of the energy at
either the mineral soil surface or the interface be-
tween burning and nonburning organic soil materials.
In general, surface fires can be characterized as short
duration, variable intensity sources of energy, while
ground fires can be characterized as longer duration
and lower intensity sources of energy (see chapter 1).
Fire severity, which is a measure of the immediate fire
effects on plants and soils, is the result of both the
intensity and duration of the flaming combustion of
surface fires and the smoldering combustion of the
organic materials (Ryan and Noste 1985, Ryan 2002).
Following ignition, surface fire behavior depends on
weather, topography, and fuels (Albini 1976, Alexander
1982, Finney 1998). Behavior is characterized by pa-
rameters that include intensity, rate of spread, and
flame geometry. One factor of significance in the
prediction of surface fire behavior is fuel compactness
(packing ratio). Compactness is the relationship be-
tween the amount of fuel in each size class (fuel
loading) and the physical volume it occupies (fuel
depth), and it is correlated with rate of spread and
intensity (Burgan and Rothermel 1984). The compact-
ness ratio of fuel loading to fuel depth reflects the
structure and composition of the vegetation (Brown
1981).
Wetland vegetation types range from short sedge
meadows to forested wetlands. The surface fuels in
graminoid-dominated or scrub-shrub wetlands are
primarily vertical, and these fuel types rapidly in-
crease in depth as loading increases. In contrast, the
fuels in forested wetlands, which are dominated more
by overstory species, are primarily horizontal, and
these fuel types slowly increase in depth as fuel load-
ing increases (Anderson 1982). The fuel loading in
many wetlands is a product of both the horizontal fuel
component of the understory and the vertical compo-
nent of the overstory.
Physiography and vegetation structure are impor-
tant factors influencing localized surface fire behavior
(Foster 1983). A wide range of fire behavior occurs in
wetlands due to the diverse wetland plant communi-
ties and their associated fuel types. Fires in hardwood
swamps will typically burn with low intensities and
low flame lengths, while fires in scrub-shrub wetlands
can exhibit extreme behavior (Wade and Ward 1973).
Measurements of pocosin scrub-shrub fuel loading
and depths show characteristics similar to the chapar-
ral vegetation type with higher loading of fine live and
dead materials (Scott 2001). In pocosins, high fuel
loads in the small size classes and the presence of
volatile oils and resins in the vegetation contribute to
high rates of spread and high intensities, making
suppression difficult (Anderson 1982).
Ground Fire in Wetlands—Due to the presence of
large amounts of organic material, ground fires are a
special concern in Histisols, Gelisols, and other soil
types with thick organic horizons. Surface fires that
result from periodic fluctuations in the water table are
correlated with weather cycles. These fires generally
consume the available surface fuels but little organic
soil material (Curtis 1959). However, fires that occur
during longer or more severe water table declines
result in significant consumption of both surface fuels
and organic soil material (Johnson 1992, Kasischke
and Stocks 2000).
Sustained combustion and depth of burn are corre-
lated with soil water content, which is a function of soil
water holding capacity, hydroperiod, and evapotrans-
piration. While soil moisture and aeration in wetland
landscapes are controlled by hydrology, the capacity of
soil to store water is influenced by the organic matter
content and its degree of decomposition. Soil water
storage capacity is correlated with physical properties
that include bulk density, organic matter content, and
hydraulic conductivity. Slightly decomposed fibric
materials in soils dominated by sphagnum moss mate-
rial have low bulk density, high hydraulic conductiv-
ity, high porosity, and hold a high percentage of water
at saturation. At saturation this fibric material can
hold greater than 850 percent of its dry weight as
water (USDA Natural Resources Conservation Ser-
vice 1998). In contrast, the highly decomposed sapric
materials found in soils formed in the pocosin wet-
lands have greater bulk density, finer pore structure,
and lower hydraulic conductivity. At saturation,  sapric
material can hold up to 450 percent of its dry weight in
water (USDA Natural Resources Conservation Ser-
vice 1998).
Following the initial ignition of organic soil material,
the probability of sustaining smoldering combustion
(that is, ground fire) is a function of moisture and
mineral content. Laboratory studies of the relationship

158

between these two factors were conducted using a
standardized ignition source and commercial peat moss
as an organic soil/duff surrogate. Peat moss was used
because of its physical and chemical uniformity.
The results show an inverse relationship between
the smoldering moisture limit and moisture and inor-
ganic content. Consequently, these results were used
to derive a sustained smoldering probability distribu-
tion based upon moisture and mineral content factors.
For comparison purposes, the results are reported at
the moisture content for a 50 percent probability level
of sustained combustion (Frandsen 1987, Hartford
1989) (table 8.4).
Organic soil materials from various wetlands show
a similar relationship between smoldering moisture
limit and moisture and mineral content. The smolder-
ing limit of low mineral content soils from a North
Carolina pocosin site is greater than the smoldering
limit of high mineral content soils from a Michigan
sedge meadow site. The results also show soil depth
differences in smoldering limits. Smoldering limits
decline with increasing depth and increasing mineral
content in black spruce/sphagnum, sedge meadow,
and other sites (Frandsen 1997) (fig. 8.7).
Although the smoldering limits for both peat moss
and organic soil materials are the function of mineral
and moisture contents, differences exist between the
predicted smoldering limits derived from the peat

moss surrogate and the limits derived from organic
soil material. With the exception of samples from
black spruce/feather moss sites in Alaska, at the 50
percent probability level, organic soil materials from
other sites smoldered at consistently higher moisture
contents than the limits predicted for peat moss.
Frandsen (1997) speculated that ignition methods
were partially responsible for some of the difference.
Fire line intensity alone does not give the total heat
input to the soil surface because it does not take into
account the residence time of the flaming combustion
or smoldering and glowing combustion (Peter 1992,
Albini and Reinhardt 1995). The long duration of
smoldering combustion is an important characteristic
that differentiates the effects of ground fires and
surface fires (Wein 1983).
In laboratory studies, the rate of smoldering com-
bustion depended on both moisture and mineral con-
tent (Frandsen 1991a,b), with the laboratory esti-
mates of smoldering rates in agreement with the 1.2 to
4.7 inches/hour (3 to 12 cm/hour) reported by Wein
(1983). The results of laboratory studies of the rela-
tionship between consumption and moisture content
have shown that sustained smoldering of sphagnum
moss was possible at up to 130 percent moisture
content, and that the percent consumption of organic
material was linked to the variability in moisture
distribution (Campbell and others 1995).

Heat transfer in organic and mineral soils is a
function of the energy produced by combustion and
soil thermal properties. The energy produced by flam-
ing and smoldering combustion depends on fuel prop-
erties and environmental conditions. Soil thermal
properties are affected by soil characteristics and
moisture content. Changes in thermal properties are
primarily the result of soil drying in advance of the
smoldering front (Peter 1992, Campbell and others
1994, 1995).
In addition to fire behavior characteristics, the depth
of burn is an important factor in predicting and inter-
preting soil heating and the effects of fire on wetland
soils. In mineral soil, the interface between the burn-
able organic materials and unburnable mineral soil is
significant because of differences in nutrient pools and
heat transfer properties. In wetland soils, the depth of
burn, which is the interface between burning and
nonburning organic soil materials, is important be-
cause it reflects the amount of organic material con-
sumed. A number of factors are correlated with depth
of burn including nutrient volatilization, ash deposi-
tion, and emissions.
Fall prescribed burns were conducted by the Nature
Conservancy in pocosin scrub-shrub wetlands in 1997
and 1998 at Green Swamp, North Carolina. The soils
were Histosols that were greater than 3 feet (0.9 m)
deep. During average years the study site is tempo-
rally flooded a number of times, and the soils remain
saturated most of the year. The vegetation and surface
fuels of the burn units were dominated by shrubs
species (Lyonia lucida and Ilex glabra), scattered pond
pine (Pinus serotina), and evergreen bays (Persia
borbonia, Gordonia lasianthus). Fuel and soil mois-
ture variability was influenced by the hummock and
depression microtopography of the ground surface.
The surface fires in both burns were active to running
surface fires with passive crowning that was associ-
ated with single or small clusters of pond pine and
evergreen bay species (Hungerford and Reardon, un-
published data).
The 1997 fall prescribed burn was conducted during
a period of extended drought and dry soil conditions
(fig. 8.8, top). At the time of burning, the water table
depth was greater than 28 inches (71 cm) from the

smoldering limits of organic soil materials in different
wetlands with the smoldering limit of an organic soil
surrogate. The dotted line is the 50 percent probability

ground surface of the depression areas. Soil moisture
in the upper profile ranged from 85 percent at the
surface to 144 percent at 6 inches (15 cm). These
moisture contents in the upper soil profile were less
than the moisture limits predicted to sustain smolder-
ing in pocosin soils. The moisture contents in the lower
soil profile (greater than 18 inches or 46 cm) were
greater than 200 percent and exceeded the moisture
limits predicted to sustained smoldering (table 8.4).
The surface fire and extended smoldering resulted
in significant consumption of soil organic material and
surface fuels (fig. 8.8, middle). After the surface fire,
the smoldering front advanced both laterally within
the upper soil profile and downward. Smoldering in
the downward direction was limited by soil moisture of
the lower soil profile. The depth of burn varied be-
tween 18 and 24 inches (46 to 61 cm) and reflected both
the soil moisture distribution within the soil profile
and the hummock and depression microtopogaphy
common in pocosin wetlands (fig. 8.9).
Soil heating below the burn/no-burn interface was
primarily the result of the long duration temperature
pulse associated with the smoldering environment.
Maximum measured temperatures 0.2 inch (0.5 cm)
below the burn/no-burn interface were greater than
680 ∞F (360 ∞C), while maximum temperature mea-
sured 2.6 inches (6.5 cm) below the burning interface
in unburned soil was less than 158 ∞F (70 ∞C) (fig. 8.10).

In areas of high burn severity, the hydrologic changes
associated with the consumption of organic soil have
led to species composition changes (fig. 8.8, bottom).
The 1998 fall prescribed burn was conducted during
a period of saturated soil conditions (fig. 8.11, top).
This burn resulted in limited consumption of surface
fuels and organic soil materials and limited soil heat-
ing (fig. 8.11, middle). At the time of burning, soil
moisture in the upper soil profile exceeded 250 per-
cent, and the water table was within 2 to 5 inches (5.1
to 12.7 cm) of the depression ground surface. The
depth of burn was limited, and the consumption of
organic soil material was restricted to the top of
hummocks and microsites with dryer soil conditions.
Litter and surface fuels were scorched but not con-
sumed in much of the unit (fig. 8.11, bottom). Soil
heating below the burn/no-burn interface was limited
and resulted from the flaming combustion primarily
associated with the surface fire. The maximum mea-
sured temperatures of unburned soil at 2.8 and 4.3
inch (7.0 and 11.0 cm) depths were 171 ∞F (77 ∞C) and
189 ∞F (87 ∞C), respectively (fig. 8.12). The removal of
dead and live fine fuel resulted in no significant spe-
cies composition changes and regrowth, and fuel accu-
mulation was sufficient to reburn the unit in autumn
2001.
The fire severity in wetlands is correlated with
depth of burn. In addition to the direct effects caused
by organic soil combustion, the physical removal of the
soil material creates a number of interrelated physi-
cal, biological, and hydrological consequences. Re-
moval of this material can result in soil moisture,
temperature, and aeration changes that affect micro-
organism activity changes and ultimately decomposi-
tion rate changes (Armentano and Menges 1986).
In boreal wetland systems, the active and perma-
frost layers depend on the presence of an insulating
moss layer (Viereck 1973, Van Cleve and Viereck
1983). A dynamic relationship exists between the
depth to permafrost, organic layer thickness, and soil
temperature. Removal of this insulating organic layer
by burning leads to an increase in soil temperatures,
changes in soil moisture regime, and an increase in
depth to permafrost. Over time, successional pro-
cesses and the reestablishment of the organic layer
will cause a decrease in soil temperatures and a
decrease in the depth of the permafrost layer (Ping
and others 1992) (fig. 8.13).
Responses to litter consumption and soil exposure
after spring burning of sedge meadow wetlands in
Michigan also result in changes in soil temperature

regime. Prescribed burns were conducted over a range
of fire intensities and resulted in the removal of the
litter and a blackened soil surface. The postburn soil
surface had higher soil temperatures and produced
increased germination rates of Carex strica (Warners
1997).
Wein (1983) suggested that low intensity fires favor
bog-forming processes because the thick organic layers
that remain after low intensity fires decompose slowly
and cause temperature and moisture changes by insu-
lating the soil and retaining moisture. In contrast,
deep hot fires resulted in increased soil temperatures
and nutrient cycling rates. These conditions favor
plant communities dominated by vascular plants.
Wetland Fire Effects and Soil Nutrient
Responses
Soil nutrient responses are the result of a number of
processes including nutrient volatilization, condensa-
tion of combustion products on cool soil surfaces, ash
deposition, and soil heating. Soil nutrients exhibit a
wide range of sensitivity to temperature changes.
Nitrogen-containing compounds are the most heat-
sensitive and show changes at temperatures as low as
392 ∞F (200 ∞C) while cations such as magnesium (Mg)
and calcium (Ca) are less sensitive and show changes
at temperatures greater than 1,832 ∞F (1,000 ∞C) (see
chapter 3; DeBano and others 1998).
Nutrient volatilization is the result of flaming and
smoldering combustion and nutrient temperature sen-
sitivity. The amount of nutrients lost to the atmo-
sphere or remaining in the ash layer are dependent on
combustion temperatures and preburn nutrient con-
tent of the fuels (Raison 1979, Soto and Diaz-Fierros
1993). Laboratory studies of smoldering combustion
were conducted with wetland organic soil cores from
black spruce/ feather moss (Alaska) and sedge meadow
(Michigan) sites. Different depth of burn treatments
were simulated by controlling soil core moisture. The
results demonstrated that ash differences in total
carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N) content produced by
smoldering combustion reflected both depth of burn
treatment and preburn nutrient levels. The ash and
char residue derived from the deep burn treatments
showed the largest reductions in total N and C
(Hungerford and Reardon unpublished data) (fig. 8.14).
In comparison with the flaming combustion of
aboveground biomass, the smoldering of high N con-
tent organic soils from pocosin scrub-shrub wetlands
in North Carolina produced larger ammonia (NH3)
and hydrocarbon emissions. Smoldering also produced
a “tar-like” substance that condensed on cool surfaces.
This material had a total N content that was six to
seven times greater than the parent material (Yokelson
and others 1997).
In addition to nutrient volatilization, combustion
temperatures, and preburn fuel nutrient content, the
Figure 8.13—Fire cycle effects on soil microclimate, permafrost,
and vegetation succession in Alaska. (adapted from Van Cleve
and Viereck 1983, Ping and others 1992).

significance of ash deposition is also dependent on the
interaction between fire and hydrology. Postburn spa-
tial and temporal water movement dynamics are the
result of surface microtopography changes and reflect
the extent and depth of burn. In wetlands, the dura-
tion and magnitude of the postburn ash-derived nutri-
ent pulse is a function of preburn nutrient levels,
burning conditions, and seasonal waterflow.
The significance of the relationship between ash
deposition and increased nutrient availability was
tested in Michigan Carex stricta dominated sedge
meadow sites. No significant increase in productivity
due to ash additions was found (Warners 1997). The
loss of ash material due to water movement was not a
factor in this study, and the results suggest that either
productivity was not limited by the nutrients present
in the ash residue or the ash produced from burnt
sedge meadow litter was nutrient poor (Warners 1997).
Nitrogen and phosphorus (P) additions were made
to a brackish marsh site in coastal North Carolina at
rates intended to simulate ash deposition from burn-
ing. The nutrient additions were made along a salinity
and hydroperiod gradient. A significant productivity
increase to low levels of N and P addition was observed
at intermediate salinity levels (Bryant and others
1991). In contrast to the Michigan sedge study (Warners
1997) these findings suggest that nutrient release
from burning may stimulate growth.
Soil and tissue nutrient concentrations from
Carex spp. dominated meadows showed complex
interrelationships between nutrient concentrations,
water depth, and fire incidence. Fire incidence and
water depth were negatively correlated with plant
tissue N, P, potassium (K), copper (Cu), manganese
(Mn), and zinc (Zn) concentrations. The results sug-
gest that volatilization and loss of these nutrients by
snowmelt and runoff after spring fires may result in
losses of these elements (Auclair 1977).
The site-specific studies of wetland systems pre-
sented in this chapter have shown mixed results in the
relationship between burning and nutrient loss and
retention. The interelationships of nutrient loss, sea-
son of burning, and wetland system are not well
understood, and generalizations across wetland sys-
tems and classes are limited at this time.
Nutrient Transformations and Cycling—In
nutrient deficient wetlands with low decomposition
rates, the increased availability of nitrate nitrogen
(NO3-N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), and phos-
phate (PO4) is linked with burning because a high
percentage of soil nutrients are stored in organic
sediments and plant material (Wilbur and Christensen
1983). Nutrient transformations that result from soil
heating are primarily dependent on soil temperatures
(DeBano and others 1998). The destructive distilla-
tion of organic materials occurs at relatively low tem-
peratures 392 to 572 ∞F (200 to 300 ∞C) (Hungerford
and others 1991), and soil temperatures above 482 ∞F
(250 ∞C) result in a decreases in available nutrients
(Kutiel and Shaviv 1992).

the laboratory burning of spruce/feather moss soil cores (Hungerford and
Reardon, unpublished data).

Wetland soil nutrient cycling processes are similar
to those of terrestrial environments, but oxygen (O2)
limitations in the wetland soil environment lead to
important differences. Anaerobic reactions require
both a supply of organic C and a soil saturated with
slow moving or stagnant water. In this environment,
aerobic organisms deplete the available O2, and anaero-
bic organisms utilize other compounds as electron
acceptors to respire and decompose organic tissues
(Craft 1999). Soil organisms dominant in aerobic soils
do not function as efficiently in low O2 environments
(Stevenson 1986), and soil chemical transformations
are dominated by reduction reactions. Dominant reac-
tions taking place in the soil include the denitrification
of NO3-N, the reduction of Mn, iron (Fe), sulfur (S), and
methane production. These reactions depend on the
presence of electron accepting compounds (such as
NO-3, Fe+3 Mn+4, SO-4), temperature, pH, and other
factors (Craft 1999).
Aerobic conditions may dominate a shallow surface
layer of waterlogged soils. The thickness of this layer
depends on hydrology and depth of burn. The chemis-
try of the remaining soil profile is dominated by reduc-
tion reactions that result from the anaerobic or O2
limiting conditions.
Burning has numerous direct influences on nutrient
cycling processes. The removal of vegetation and litter
material changes the surface soil moisture and tem-
perature dynamics of bare soils, leading to changes in
microbial composition and activity. Altered microbial
activity can result in nutrient cycling changes in
nitrogen mineralization, nitrification rates, and phos-
phorous mineralization rates.
Wetland Soil Nutrients—Carbon is stored in both
living and dead plant materials. In wetland soils the
percentage of the total C stored in dead materials is
greater than in other terrestrial systems. Because the C
sequestered in wetlands contains approximately 10 per-
cent of the global C pool, wetlands play an important role
in the global C cycle (Schlesinger 1991). The C balance
in wetlands is sensitive to land management and
environmental factors (Trettin and others 2001) and is
a function of numerous interrelated factors including
productivity, decomposition, and fire frequency.
Factors influencing C accumulation rates were
studied in sphagnum-dominated boreal peatlands in
Western Canada (Kuhry 1994). The results showed
that increased frequency of peat surface fires led to
decreases in C accumulation rates and organic layer
thickness. Kuhry (1994) concludes that in these sys-
tems, the increased short-term productivity from
postburn nutrient release may not compensate for the
peat lost from frequent burning.
In contrast to sphagnum-dominated boreal systems,
the burning of forested wetlands in the Southeastern
United States can lead to increased C accumulation
rates. The loss of overstory vegetation that results
from burning produces changes in the balance be-
tween transpiration from vegetation and surface evapo-
ration from exposed soil. Evapotranspiration changes
leading to higher water levels and reduced soil O2
limitation may cause decreased decomposition rates
and increased C accumulation rates (Craft 1999).
In freshwater wetlands, N is present in both organic
and inorganic forms. Organic N is associated with
plants, microbes, and sediments, while inorganic N is
associated primarily with water and sediments (Craft
1999). Important transformations of available N in-
volve the diffusion of NH4-N between aerobic layers
where mineralization and nitrification dominate N
cycling and anaerobic layers where denitrification
dominates N cycling (Patrick 1982, Schmalzer and
Hinkle 1992).
Laboratory burning of wetland soil cores showed the
effects of smoldering combustion on the distribution of
available N. Different depth of burn treatments were
simulated by manipulating soil core moisture. Com-
parisons of pre- and postburn available N distribu-
tions showed postburn NH4-N enrichment below the
ash deposition layer and the burn/no-burn interface
(Hungerford and Reardon unpublished data). The
findings support the conclusions of DeBano and others
(1976) and suggest that the increase in available N
was caused by soil heating and/or the condensation of
N-rich combustion products on unburned soil surfaces
(fig. 8.15).
Phosphorous limitation is common in wetlands be-
cause unlike N and C, it has no significant biologically
induced or atmospheric inputs (Paul and Clark 1989).
In wetlands the vegetation and organic sediments are
the major storage sites for P, and cycling in wetlands
is dominated by vegetation and microbes (Craft 1999).
Phosphorus is present in wetland soils in a number of
forms: organic forms in live and partially decomposed
plant materials, in mineral form bound to aluminum
(Al), Fe, Ca, Mg, and in orthophosphate compounds
(Craft 1999).
The spring burning of pocosin scrub-shrub wetland
sites produced immediate increases in NO3-N, NH4-N,
and PO4. Surface temperatures were moderate, and
only limited smoldering combustion was observed.
Postburn NO3-N levels increased and remained high
throughout the 18-month study. Postburn PO4 con-
centrations were initially elevated but returned to
preburn levels by the end of the first growing season.
The NH4-N levels were high throughout the first
growing season following burning but returned to
prefire levels by the end of that growing season. The
limited soil heating from the surface fire and addi-
tional results from laboratory soil incubation studies
suggested that postburn N and P nutrient increases
were primarily the result of ash deposition (Wilbur
1985).

The spring burning of Juncus spp. and Spartina spp.
marshes in central Florida resulted in significant soil
nutrient changes. Increases in PO4 and soil cations
were attributed to ash deposition (Schmalzer and
Hinkle 1992). In contrast, the results of winter burn-
ing of Juncus and Spartina marsh communities on
the Mississippi Gulf Coast suggested that increases in
extractable P were the result of mild heating of organic
sediments, and the retention of ash-derived nutrients
may be a function of meteorological factors, tidal
regimes, and topography (Faulkner and de la Cruz
1982).
Ammonium nitrogen levels of the Juncus and
Spartina Florida marsh study sites were elevated for
a period after the burn when the water table declined
and soil temperatures increased. The results suggest
that the NH4-N changes were the result of increased
soil O2, soil temperatures, and higher N mineraliza-
tion rates. Postburn soil NO3-N levels were high and
eventually declined because of a return of anaerobic
conditions 6 to 9 months after burning. The authors
suggest that NO3-N declines were the caused by either
decreases in nitrification or increases in denitrifica-
tion rates. Soil heating was limited by standing water
during the burning, and the results suggest that
available nitrogen nutrient responses were linked
with seasonal hydrology.
The role of fire in the biogeochemical cycles of
trace metals is not well understood, and much research
is currently being conducted in this area. Organic
sediments accumulate metals such as mercury (Hg),
arsenic, and selenium (Se) as a result of environmen-
tal processes including atmospheric deposition and
water movement from upstream sources. The origins
of these trace metals range from natural processes
such as geochemical weathering to anthropogenic pro-
cesses such as fossil fuel burning and agricultural
runoff. These metals are transformed by microorgan-
isms and enter the food web in wetland environments
in methylated forms (Stevenson 1986). The accumula-
tion and release of these metals is of concern because
they are toxic to many organisms.
Selenium accumulation is of concern in wetlands in
a number of Western States due to widespread geo-
logical sources. Wetland plants such as cattails and
bullrush can accumulate Se, and the decomposition of
the dead plant material produces organic sediments
with large amounts of the element. The effect of
burning on Se volatilization from wetland plants was
studied at Benton Lakes National Wildlife Refuge in
Montana (Zang 1997). The result showed that burning
of wetland plants can volatilize up to 80 percent of the
Se in leaves and stems, and the author suggests that
fire may be an effective method of reducing the sele-
nium concentrations of wetland sediments.
Mercury accumulation is a growing concern in wet-
land management. It is the result of atmospheric
deposition and fossil fuel combustion. Inorganic Hg in
sediments is transformed to methylated forms by
microbial activity. The methylated forms of Hg are

char material from the laboratory burning of black spruce/feather moss soil cores

highly bioaccumlative and are readily incorporated
into the food web. The effects of fire and prolonged
drying on methylation rates were studied in the Florida
Everglades (Krabbenhoft and others 2001). The re-
sults showed that burning and prolonged drying
changed soil and ground water properties and re-
sulted in Hg methylation rate increases. These rate
increases were linked with postburn sulfate availabil-
ity during reflooding. Increases in the average hydro-
period may result in a decrease in the occurrence and
magnitude of conditions linked with high methylation
rates.
Wetland Management Considerations
The wide distribution and critical ecological func-
tions that are provided by wetlands make their contin-
ued health crucial to environmental quality. Contrary
to the general perceptions of wetlands, ecological and
paleoecological evidence suggests that creation and
maintenance of these important ecosystems depends
on fire and other disturbances. Land managers deal-
ing with wetland ecosystems need to understand the
ecological role of fire. Experience gained by the re-
newed use of prescribed fire and prescribed natural
fire in wetlands will improve our understanding of
important wetland processes and vegetation develop-
ment. Increased knowledge will enable us to deal more
effectively with wetland management challenges such
as habitat restoration, threatened and endangered
species management, and hazardous fuel reduction.
Riparian Ecosystems ____________
Riparian areas are an integral and important com-
ponent of watersheds throughout most of the United
States (Baker and others 1998, Brooks and others
2003). They occur in both arid and humid regions and
include the green-plant communities along the banks
of rivers and streams (National Academy of Science
2002) (fig. 8.16). Riparian areas are found not only
along most major waterways in arid and humid areas
throughout the United States, but they are also impor-
tant management areas on small perennial, ephem-
eral, and intermittent streams.
Riparian areas are a particularly unique and impor-
tant part of the landscape in the Western United
States where they represent the interface between
aquatic and adjacent terrestrial ecosystems and are
made up of unique vegetative and animal communi-
ties that require the regular presence of free or un-
bound water. Riparian vegetation in the United States
ranges widely and includes high mountain meadows,
deciduous and evergreen forests, pinyon juniper and
encinal woodlands, shrublands, deserts, and desert
grasslands. In most watersheds, riparian areas make
up only a small percentage of the total land area (for
example, only about 1 percent or less in the Western
United States), yet their hydrologic and biological
functions must be considered in the determination of
water and other resource management goals for the
entire watershed.

New Mexico (Top, photo by Daniel Neary); Verde
River, Arizona (Middle, photo by Alvin Medina); Black
River, Arizona (Bottom, photo by Alvin Medina).

Riparian areas have high value in terms of diversity
because they share characteristics with both adjacent
upland and aquatic ecosystems (Crow and others
2000). The kinds of biological and physical diversity
vary widely, spatially and temporally, and thereby
contribute greatly to the overall diversity of numbers,
kinds, and patterns in the landscape and waterscape
ecosystems along with a multitude of ecological pro-
cesses associated with these patterns (Lapin and
Barnes 1995). Also, riparian areas support a variety of
plants and animals that are not found elsewhere,
including threatened and endangered species. They
play other important, but less obvious, roles relating
to enhanced water quality, flood peak attenuation,
and reduced erosion and sediment transport.
Riparian Definition and Classification
Riparian areas can be defined in many ways depend-
ing upon individual viewpoints or purposes. These
approaches can reflect agency concepts, the disciplines
involved, or the particular functional role that a ripar-
ian area plays in the total ecosystem (Ilhardt and others
2000). For example, a technical definition developed by
the Society of Range Management and the Bureau of
Land Management (Anderson 1987, p. 70) is:
A riparian area is a distinct ecological site, or
combination of sites, in which soil moisture is suffi-
ciently in excess of that otherwise available locally, due
to run-on and/or subsurface seepage, so as to result in
an existing or potential soil-vegetation complex that
depicts the influence of that extra soil moisture. Ripar-
ian areas may be associated with lakes; reservoirs;
estuaries; potholes; springs; bogs; wet meadows;
muskegs; and intermittent and perennial streams.
The characteristics of the soil-vegetation complex are
the differentiating criteria.
Disciplinary definitions are oriented to the particu-
lar disciplines involved, whereas functional defini-
tions focus on using the flow of energy and materials
as their basis rather than being based on static state
variables.
Classifying riparian systems has involved schemes
of hierarchical approaches based on geomorphology,
soils, moisture regimes, plant succession, vegetation,
and stream channels, or combinations of these param-
eters. Resource managers are increasingly interested
in classifying riparian systems because of their impor-
tant and unique values. A basic understanding of the
ecology of riparian systems is complicated by extreme
variation in geology, climate, terrain, hydrology, and
disturbances by humans. Geomorphology is especially
useful on riparian sites where the natural vegetation
composition, soils, or water regimes, or a combination
of these, have been altered by past disturbance, either
natural or human induced. Other classification
schemes are based on stream classification systems
such as that developed by Rosgen (1994).
Hydrology of Riparian Systems
Riparian ecosystems are controlled by water, veg-
etation, soils, and a host of biotic organisms extending
in size from microorganisms to large mammals. Water
and its hydrologic processes, however, are a central
functional force affecting the riparian-watershed sys-
tem and are the main component that links a particu-
lar stream and associated riparian vegetation to the
surrounding watershed. The magnitude and direction
of the riparian-watershed relationship is further tem-
pered by geology, geomorphology, topography, and
climate—and their interactions. This interrelation-
ship between riparian area and surrounding water-
shed is the most sensitive to natural and human-
related disturbances, including fire (DeBano and
Neary 1996, DeBano and others 1998).
The important hydrologic processes include runoff
and erosion, ground water movement, and streamflow.
As the boundary between land and stream habitats,
streambanks occupy a unique position in the riparian
system (Bohn 1986). Bank and channel profiles affect
stream temperature, water velocity, sediment input,
and hiding cover and suitable living space for fish.
Streamside vegetation on stable banks provides food
and shade for both fish and wildlife. As a result,
streambank condition and the quality of the fish habi-
tat are closely linked.
Riparian systems in arid environments are hydro-
logically different from those found in more humid
areas. In the arid West, intermittent streamflow and
variable annual precipitation are more common than
in the more humid areas of the Eastern United States.
As a result, riparian systems in humid regions are less
dependent on annual recharge by episodic events to
sustain flow and are more dependent on a regular and
dependable ground water flow accompanied by
interflow (subsurface flow) and, to a lesser extent, on
overland flow. Watersheds in humid regions also com-
monly have lakes, ponds, and other systems that
sustain flows over much of the year. As a result of
variable precipitation, sediment transport is more
episodic in the arid West, where pulses of aggradation
and degradation are punctuated by periods of inactiv-
ity. Unlike on humid watersheds, side-slope erosion in
drylands is discontinuous, and there are often long lag
periods between watershed events and sediment de-
livery (Heede and others 1988). Channels in humid
regions tend to be more stable over the long term, and
the macrotopography of these systems, though still
responsive to flooding events, tends to evolve much
more slowly.
Riparian Fire Effects
Fire is a common disturbance in both riparian eco-
systems and the surrounding hillslopes, and both

168
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
wildfires and prescribed burns occur in many of these
riparian-watershed systems. Fire affects riparian ar-
eas both directly and indirectly. The direct effects
consist mainly of damage to the vegetation (trees,
shrubs, and grasses) that intercepts precipitation, and
the partial consumption of the underlying litter layer.
The severity of the damage to the riparian vegetation
depends upon the severity of the fire, which could
consume part or all of the vegetation. Severe wildfires
can cause profound damage to plant cover and can
increase streamflow velocity, sedimentation rates, and
stream water temperatures, as contrasted to low se-
verity, cool-burning prescribed fires, which have less
severe consequences. When fire burns the surround-
ing watershed, the indirect effect on the riparian area
is that it decreases basin stability, and in steep erod-
ible topography, debris flows along with dry ravel and
small landslides off hillslopes are common. Therefore,
the recovery of vegetation following fire reflects the
combined disturbance of both the fire and flooding,
and together they can impact the time required for
revegetation and postfire rehabilitation efforts.
Role of Large Woody Debris
Large organic debris is a major component of water-
sheds and river systems because of its important role
in hydraulics, sediment routing, and channel mor-
phology of streams flowing through riparian systems
(Smith and others 1993, DeBano and Neary 1996). An
additional benefit of large woody debris is in nutrient
cycling and the productivity of forest vegetation.
Through time, entire live and dead trees and shrubs,
or parts of them, are likely to fall into stream channels
within riparian ecosystems. This woody debris in-
creases the complexity of stream habitats by physi-
cally obstructing water flow. For example, trees ex-
tending partially across the channel deflect the current
laterally, causing it to widen the streambed. Sediment
stored by debris also adds to hydraulic complexity,
especially in organically rich channels that are often
wide and shallow and possess a high diversity of riffles
and pools in low gradient streams of alluvial valley
floors. Stream stabilization after major floods, debris
torrents, or massive landslides is accelerated by large
woody debris along and within the channel. After
wildfire, while the postfire forest is developing, the
aquatic habitat may be maintained by large woody
debris supplied to the stream by the prefire forests.
Coarse woody debris accumulations are usually larger
in the first few years following a wildfire than in prefire
years, but they generally decline to below prefire condi-
tions thereafter. The recovery time to prefire conditions
ranges from 25 to 300 years depending on the stability
of the ecosystem burned. While in stream channels, this
added debris can have a beneficial effect on aquatic
habitats in the short term by providing structure to the
streams. Long-term impacts can be disruptive to stream
morphology and the consequent streamflow and sedi-
ment transport regimes. Carefully prescribed fire should
not affect the accumulations of coarse woody debris
either on the watershed or in the channel. Recom-
mended amounts of woody debris to be left on the
watershed in Arizona, Idaho, and Montana are given
earlier in chapter 4 (see also Graham and others 1994).
Coarse woody debris in the stream channels of
burned riparian ecosystems is made up of components
of larger individual size, and forms larger accumula-
tions, than that of unburned systems. Postfire debris
is also likely to be moved more frequently over longer
distances in subsequent streamflow events (Young
1994). Managers frequently debate the merits of leav-
ing burned dead debris in stream channels following
fire. Some managers feel that this material could jam
culverts and bridges, causing these structures to wash
out and cause flooding, and, as a consequence, these
managers feel the debris should be removed (Barro
and others 1989). However, removal of this debris can
also result in changes in channel morphology, a scour-
ing of the channel bed, increases in streamflow veloci-
ties and sediment loads, an export of nutrients out of
the ecosystem, and a deterioration of biotic habitats.
Removal of postfire accumulations of coarse woody
debris, therefore, is likely to best be decided on a site-
specific basis.
Riparian Management Considerations
Fire is an important factor to consider in the man-
agement of riparian ecosystems. Most fire in riparian
areas can be intense and cause extensive damage to
the vegetation. However, even after severe fires, re-
covery can be rapid within a couple years to prefire
conditions in some environments, but not all. The
recovery of vegetation following fire reflects the com-
bined disturbance of both the fire and flooding.
Riparian areas are particularly important because
they provide buffer strips that trap sediment and
nutrients that are released when surrounding water-
sheds are burned. The width of these buffer strips is
critical for minimizing sediment and nutrient move-
ment into the streams. The best available guidelines
for buffer width associated with prescribed fire are
that for low intensity fires, less than 2 feet (0.6 m) high,
that do not kill stream-shading shrubs and trees. Such
fire can be used throughout the riparian area without
creating substantial damage. Where fire damages
woody vegetation, the width should be proportional to
the size of the contributing area, slope, cultural prac-
tices in the upslope area, and the nature of the drain-
age below. A general rule of thumb is that a width of
30 feet (9 m) plus (0.46 x percent slope) be left along the
length of the stream to protect the riparian resource
(DeBano and others 1998).

Managers need to consider the mixed concerns about
leaving downed large woody debris in, or near, channel
following fire. On one hand, large woody debris plays
an important role in hydraulics, sediment routing,
and channel morphology of streams flowing through
riparian systems, thereby enhancing these systems.
On the other hand, to protect life and property, chan-
nel clearing treatments following fire is usually desir-
able. The USDA Forest Service suggests that the best
management practice balances downstream value
protection with the environmental implications of the
treatment.
Summary ______________________
While the connection between wetlands and ripar-
ian ecosystems and fire appears incongruous, fire
plays an integral role in the creation and persistence
of hydric species and ecosystems. Wetland and riparian
systems have been classified with various classification
systems that reflect both the current understanding
of biogeochemical processes and the missions of the
individual land management agencies.
This chapter examines some of the complex water
inflows and outflows that are balanced by the interre-
lationships between biotic and abiotic factors. The
presence and movement of water are dominant factors
controlling the interactions of fire with wetland dy-
namics, nutrient and energy flow, soil chemistry, or-
ganic matter decomposition, and plant and animal
community composition.
In wetland and riparian soils, the effects produced
by surface and ground fires are related to the intensity
of fire at either the soil surface or the interface be-
tween burning and nonburning organic soil materials.
In general, surface fires can be characterized as short
duration, variable intensity ones, while ground fires
can be characterized as having longer duration and
lower intensity. However, the latter type of fires can
also produce high severity fires with profound physi-
cal and chemical changes.

Introduction ____________________
In many cases, decisions about fire have to be made
in short timeframes with limited information. Fire
effects models have been developed or adapted to help
land and fire managers make decisions on the poten-
tial and actual effects of both prescribed fires and
wildfires on ecosystem resources (fig. 9.1). Fire effects
models and associated erosion and runoff models ap-
ply the best fire science to crucial management deci-
sions. These models are undergoing constant revision
and update to make the latest information available to
fire managers using the state-of-the-art computer
hardware and software. Use of these models requires
a commitment to understand their assumptions, ben-
efits, and shortcomings, and a commitment to con-
stant professional development.

predicting and planning for fire effects. FOFEM pro-
vides quantitative predictions of fire effects for plan-
ning prescribed fires that best accomplish resource
needs, for impact assessment, and for long-range plan-
ning and policy development. FOFEM was developed
from long-term fire effects data collected by USDA
Forest Service and other scientists across the United
States and Canada (fig. 9.2).
Description, Overview, and Features
First order fire effects are those that concern the
direct or indirect of immediate consequences of fire.
First order fire effects form an important basis for
predicting secondary effects such as tree regeneration
plant succession, soil erosion, and changes in site
productivity, but these long-term effects generally
involve interaction with many variables (for example,
weather, animal use, insects, and disease) and are not
predicted by this program. FOFEM predicts fuel con-
sumption, smoke production, and tree mortality. The
area of applicability is nationwide on forest and
nonforest vegetation types. FOFEM also contains a
planning mode for prescription development.
Applications, Potential Uses, Capabilities,
and Goals
FOFEM makes fire effects research results readily
available to managers. Potential uses include wild-
fire impact assessment, development of salvage speci-
fications, design of fire prescriptions, environmental
assessment, and fire management planning. FOFEM
can also be used in real time, quickly estimating tree
mortality, smoke generation, and fuel consumption
of ongoing fires.
Scope and Primary Geographic
Applications
FOFEM—national in scope—uses four geographic
regions: Pacific West, Interior West, Northeast, and
Southeast. Forest cover types provide an additional
level of resolution within each region, and SAF and
FRES vegetation types to stratify data and methods.
Geographic regions and cover types are used both as
part of the algorithm selection key, and also as a key
to default input values. FOFEM contains data and
prediction equations that apply throughout the United
States for most forest and rangeland vegetation types
that experience fire.
Input Variables and Data Requirements
FOFEM was designed so that data requirements are
minimal and flexible. Default values are provided for
almost all inputs, but users can modify any or all
defaults to provide custom inputs.
Output, Products, and Performance
FOFEM computes the direct effects of prescribed
fire or wildfire. It estimates fuel consumption by fuel
component for duff, litter, small and large woody fuels,
herbs, shrubs and tree regeneration, and crown foli-
age and branchwood. It also estimates mineral soil
exposure, smoke production of CO, PM10, and PM2.5,
and percent tree mortality by species and size class.
Alternatively, if the user enters desired levels of these
fire effects, FOFEM computes fuel moistures and fire
intensities that should result in desired effects.
Advantages, Benefits, and Disadvantages
FOFEM is easy to use, applies to most vegetation
types and geographic areas, synthesizes and makes
available a broad range of available research results,
incorporates planning and prediction modes, and pro-
vides a wide range of data in the form of default inputs
for different vegetation and fuel types. The main
disadvantage is that FOFEM is not currently linked to
any other models (fire behavior, smoke dispersion,
postfire succession).
System and Computer Requirements
FOFEM version 5.0 is available for IBM-compatible
PCs with Windows 98 and Windows 2000 operating
systems. FOFEM is supported by the Fire Effects
Research Work Unit, Intermountain Fire Sciences

Models for Heat and Moisture
Transport in Soils _______________
Transfer of heat into the soil beneath a fire produces
a large number of onsite fire effects to the physical,
chemical, and biological properties of soils (Hungerford
1990) that include:
•
plant mortality and injury
•
soil organism mortality and injury
•
thermal decomposition of organic matter
•
oxidation or volatilization of chemical compo-
nents of the upper soil profile
•
other physiochemical changes
To predict the nature and extent of these effects, we
need to understand temperature profiles within the
soil beneath burned areas (Albini and others 1996).
Temperature profiles are rarely measured in actual
fires, so some type of model is needed to predict soil
temperatures and the response of soils to the thermal
input. Albini and others (1996) reviewed a number of
existing models to determine their applicability and
recommend future development goals.
The Albini and others (1996) review of heat transfer
models from the soil science, engineering, and geo-
physics fields concluded that the only useful models
for describing heat transfer phenomena for wildland
fires come from the soil science arena. The models of
Campbell and others (1992, 1995) seem to function
well in predicting temperature histories and profiles
of soils heated at rates and temperatures consistent
with wildland fires. Their model did not perform as
well with soil moisture contents as with temperatures.
Because many of the heating effects are a function of
soil moisture, this is an important ability for heat
transfer prediction models.
Albini and others (1996) identified the omission of
a number of important features in the soil science
models. These include diffusive transport of water as
a vapor or liquid, momentum equations, predictions
of the transient movement of phase-change bound-
aries, lateral nonhomogeneity of soils, and the rapid
decline of wetting attraction of liquid water to quartz
near 149 ∞F (65 ∞C).
Finally, Albini and others (1996) made recommen-
dations for further model development and simplifica-
tions of the existing models. They believed that some
simplification would improve the use of the existing
models without much sacrifice in the fidelity of their
predictions.
WEPP, WATSED, and RUSLE Soil
Erosion Models _________________
Following a fire, it is often necessary to use some
standard prediction technology to evaluate the risk of
soil erosion. For forests that tend to regenerate rap-
idly, the risk of erosion decreases quickly after the first
year, at a rate of almost 90 percent each year. For
example, the year following a fire may experience 0.4
to 0.9 tons/acre (1 to 2 Mg/ha) erosion, the second year
less than 0.04 to 0.10 tons/acre (0.1 to 0.3 Mg/ha), and
the third year may be negligible (Robichaud and Brown
1999). The erosion rate depends on the climate, topog-
raphy, soil properties (including hydrophobicity), and
amount of surface cover. Surface cover may include
unburned duff, rock, and needle cast following fire.
Three models are commonly used after soil erosion.
In USDA Forest Service Regions 1 and 4, the WATSED
and similar models have frequently been used (USDA
Forest Service 1990b). The Universal Soil Loss Equa-
tion (USLE) has been used widely for many years, and
more recently, the Revised USLE, or RUSLE, has
become common (Renard and others 1997). The Water
Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model has recently
been parameterized for predicting erosion after fire,
and an interface has been developed to aid in that
prediction. Improvements in the usability of both the
RUSLE and WEPP prediction technologies are ongo-
ing. The WATSED model is intended to be a cumula-
tive affects model, to be applied at watershed scale.
RUSLE and WEPP are hillslope models. WEPP has a
watershed version under development, but it has
received little use outside of research evaluation.
WATSED is intended as a watershed model to com-
bine the cumulative effects of forest operations, fires,
and roads on runoff and sediment yield for a given
watershed. Factors that account for burned area within
the watershed, soil properties, topography, and deliv-
ery ratios are identified, and an average sediment
delivery is calculated. This sediment delivery is re-
duced over a 15-year period following a fire before the
impact is assumed to be zero. Within the Western
geographical territory of the Forest Service Regions,
some of the factors have been adjusted to calibrate the

174
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
model for local conditions, leading to the development
of models such as NEZSED and BOISED. The erosion
predictions are based on observations in the moun-
tains in Regions 1 and 4, and are not intended for use
elsewhere. Table 9.1 provides the erosion rates pre-
dicted in WATSED, corrected for a USLE LS factor of
11.2 (Wischmeier and Smith 1978). These rates are
adjusted for topography, landscape, and soil proper-
ties before arriving at a final prediction. A variation of
the technology in WATSED has been adopted by the
State of Washington for its Watershed Analysis proce-
dure (Washington Forest Practices Board 1997).
The Revised USLE was developed not only for agri-
culture, but also included rangeland conditions. The
RUSLE base equation is:
A = R K LS C P
(1)
Where A is the average annual erosion rate, R is the
rainfall erosivity factor, K is the soil erodibility factor,
LS is the slope length and steepness factor, C is the
cover management factor, and P is the conservation
management factor. Although it has not been widely
tested, the RUSLE values appear to give reasonable
erosion values for rangelands (Renard and Simanton
1990, Elliot and others 2000) and will likely do the same
for forests. There are no forest climates available in the
RUSLE database. Table 9.1 provides some assump-
tions about rate of vegetation regeneration and typical
erosion rates estimated for burned and recovering for-
est conditions based on those assumed cover values.
The RUSLE LS factor was about 6.54, almost half of
the USLE C-factor used for WATSED. The RUSLE LS
factor is based on more recent research and the analysis
of a greater number of plots (McCool and others 1987,
1989), so it should probably be used with the WATSED
technology to adjust for slope length and steepness.
The RUSLE R factor was estimated as 20 from the
documentation (Renard and others 1997). This is a
relatively low value because much of the precipitation
in the Northern Rockies comes as snowfall, and snow-
melt events cause much less erosion than rainfall
events.
The most recent erosion prediction technology is the
Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model
(Flanagan and Livingston 1995). WEPP is a complex
process-based computer model that predicts soil ero-
sion by modeling the processes that cause erosion.
These processes include daily plant growth, residue
accumulation and decomposition, and daily soil water
balance. Each day that has a precipitation or snow
melt event, WEPP calculates the infiltration, runoff,
and sediment detachment, transport, deposition, and
yield.
WEPP was released for general use in 1995, with an
MS DOS text-based interface. Currently a Windows
interface is under development and is available for
general use (USDA 2000). Elliot and Hall (1997) devel-
oped a set of input templates to describe forest condi-
tions for the WEPP model, for the MS DOS interface.
The WEPP model allows the user to describe the site
conditions with hundreds of variables, making the
model extremely flexible, but also making it difficult
for the casual user to apply to a given set of conditions.
To make the WEPP model run more easily for forest
conditions, Elliot and others (2000) developed a suite
of interfaces to run WEPP over the Internet using Web
browsers. The forest version of WEPP can be found at:
http://forest.moscowfsl.wsu.edu/fswepp
One of the interfaces is Disturbed WEPP, which
allows the user to select from a set of vegetation
conditions that describe the fire severity and recover-
ing conditions. The Disturbed WEPP alters both the
soil and the vegetation properties when a given veg-
etation treatment is selected. Table 9.2 shows the
vegetation treatment selected for each of the years of
recovery. In all cases, the cover input was calibrated to
ensure that WEPP generated the desired cover given

in table 9.1. The Disturbed WEPP interface has access
to a database of more than 2,600 weather stations to
allow the user to select the nearest station to the
disturbed site. The values in table 9.3 were predicted
for Warren, ID, climate. Warren climate is similar to
the climate for Robichaud and Brown’s study, and also
near the site where the WATSED base erosion rates
were developed in central Idaho.
An important aspect of soil erosion following a fire is
that the degree of erosion depends on the weather the
year immediately following the fire. Table 9.1 shows
the rapid recovery of a forest in the years after fire. If
the year after the fire has a number of erosive storms,
then the erosion rate will be high. If the year after the
fire is relatively dry, then the erosion rate will be low.
The values presented in table 9.1 are all average
values. There is a 50 percent chance that the erosion
in this most susceptible year will be less than the
average value. To allow managers to better evaluate
the risk of a given level of erosion following a fire, the
Disturbed WEPP interface includes some probability
analyses with the output, giving the user an indication
of the probability associated with a given level of
erosion. Table 9.3 shows that there is a one in 50, or
2 percent, chance that the erosion rate from the
specified hill will exceed 3.18 tons/acre (7.12 Mg/ha),
and the sediment delivery will exceed 2.88 tons/acre
(6.45 Mg/ha). There is a one in 10, or 10 percent,
chance that the erosion and sediment delivery rate
will exceed 2.11 tons/acre (4.72 Mg/ha), and so forth.
This feature will allow users to evaluate risks of
upland erosion and sediment delivery to better deter-
mine the degree of mitigation that may be justified
following a given fire. In California, for example,
erosion is often estimated for a 5-year condition, which
in this case is 1.47 tons/acre (3.3 Mg/ha). Disturbed
WEPP also predicted that there was an 80 percent
chance that there would be erosion on this hillslope the
year following the fire.
The variability of erosion following a fire due to the
climate makes any measurements difficult to evalu-
ate. Note in table 9.1 the large drop from year 1 to
year 2 in erosion rate. This decline was likely due not
only to regeneration but also to the lower precipitation
in 1996. In the nearby Warren, ID, climate, the aver-
age precipitation is 696 mm; the year following the fire
it was 722 mm, and the second year after the fire only
537 mm. These variations from the mean also help
explain why the Disturbed WEPP predicted erosion
rates in table 9.1 for “average” conditions were below
the observed value the first year but above the ob-
served value the second year.
The variability in erosion observations and predic-
tions is influenced not only by climate but also by spatial
variability of soil and topographic properties. In soil
erosion research to determine soil properties, it is not
uncommon to have a standard deviation in observa-
tions from identical plots greater than the mean. A rule
of thumb in interpreting erosion observations or predic-
tions is that the true “average” value is likely to be
within plus or minus 50 percent of the observed value.
In other words, if a value of 0.9 tons/acre (2 Mg/ha) is
observed in the field from a single observation, the true
“average” erosion from that hillside is likely to be
between 0.4 and 1.3 tons/acre (1 and 3 Mg/ha). Follow-
ing this rule leads to the conclusions that WATSED,
RUSLE, and WEPP predictions in table 9.1 are not
different from the observed erosion rates.

In the years of regeneration, it appears that both
WATSED and RUSLE are overpredicting observed
erosion rates, whereas the Disturbed WEPP predic-
tions are nearer to the observed values. WATSED, as
a cumulative effects model, is considering the impact
of the disturbance on a watershed scale. Frequently
eroded sediments following a disturbance may take
several years to be routed through the watershed,
whereas WEPP is only considering the hillslope in its
predictions. RUSLE is also a hillslope model but con-
siders only the upland eroding part of the hillside and
does not consider any downslope deposition. This
means that RUSLE values will frequently be
overpredicted unless methods to estimate delivery
ratio are considered. A RUSLE2 model currently un-
der development addresses downslope deposition and
sediment delivery.
Model Selection
Managers must determine which model most suits
the problem at hand. The WATSED technology is
geographic specific, as is the Washington Forest Prac-
tices model. These models should not be used outside
of the areas for which they were developed. The
WATSED technology is intended to assist in water-
shed analysis and not necessarily intended for esti-
mating soil erosion after fires. RUSLE is intended to
predict upland erosion and is best suited for estimat-
ing potential impacts of erosion on onsite productivity.
It is less well suited for predicting offsite sediment
delivery. The WEPP technology provides estimates of
both upland erosion for soil productivity consider-
ations and sediment delivery for offsite water quality
concerns. The WEPP DOS and Windows technology
requires skill to apply and should be considered only
by trained specialists. The Disturbed WEPP interface
requires little training, and documentation with ex-
amples is included on the Web site, making it available
to a wider range of users.
DELTA-Q and FOREST
Models ________________________
Two other models warrant brief mentioning. They
can assist fire managers in dealing with watershed
scale changes in water flow and erosion. These are
DELTA-Q and FOREST. Both programs require an
ESRI Arc 8.x license. Further documentation can be
found at:
http://www.cnr.colostate.edu/frws/people/faculty
macdonald/model.htm.
One of the difficult tasks facing land managers, fire
managers, and hydrologists is quantifying the changes
in streamflow after forest disturbances such as fire.
The changes of interest are alteration of peak, median,
and low flows as well as the degradation of water
quality due to increased sediment delivery to channels
or channel degradation.
DELTA-Q is a model designed to calculate the cumu-
lative changes in streamflow on a watershed scale
from areas subjected to the combination of harvesting
and road construction. Flow changes due to forest
cover removal by wildfire can also be calculated. A
current data limitation in the model is that it evalu-
ates only changes due to vegetation combustion, not
the possible effects of alterations to runoff and
streamflow generation processes. The objective of
DELTA-Q is to provide fire and watershed managers
with a GIS-based tool that can quickly approximate
the sizes of changes in different flow percentiles. The
model does not estimate the increases in streamflow
from extreme events (see chapters 2 and 5). The model
was designed to be used for planning at watershed
scales of 5 to 50 mi2 (3,200 to 32,000 acres, or 1,300 to
13,000 ha).
The FOREST (FORest Erosion Simulation Tools)
model functions with DELTA-Q. It calculates changes
in the sediment regime due to forest disturbances. It
consists of a hillslope model that uses a polygon GIS
layer of land disturbances to calculate sediment pro-
duction. Road-related sediment is treated separately
because roads are linear features in the landscape.
Input values for the road segment can be generated by
several means including WEPP.Road. FOREST does
not deal with changes in channel stability.
Models Summary _______________
This chapter is not meant as a comprehensive look at
simulation models. Several older modeling technolo-
gies commonly used estimate fire effects during and
after fire (FOFEM, WATSED, WEPP, RUSLE, and
others). New ones such as DELTA-Q, FOREST have
been recently developed, and others are under con-
struction. These process-based models provide man-
agers with additional tools to estimate the magnitude
of fire effects on soil and water produced by land
disturbance. FOFEM was developed to meet needs of
resource managers, planners, and analysts in predict-
ing and planning for fire effects. Quantitative predic-
tions of fire effects are needed for planning prescribed
fires that best accomplish resource needs, for impact
assessment, and for long-range planning and policy
development. FOFEM was developed to meet this
information need. The WATSED technology was de-
veloped for watershed analysis. The RUSLE model
was developed for agriculture and rangeland hillslopes
and has been extended to forest lands. The WEPP
model was designed as an improvement over RUSLE
that can either be run as a stand-alone computer

model by specialists, or accessed through a special
Internet interface designed for forest applications,
including wild fires.
All of these models have limitations that must be
understood by fire managers or watershed specialists
before they are applied. The models are only as good as
the data used to create and validate them. Some
processes such as extreme flow and erosion events are
not simulated very well because of the lack of good
data or the complexity of the processes. However, they
do provide useful tools to estimate landscape changes
to disturbances such as fire. Potential users should
make use of the extensive documentation of these
models and consult with the developers to ensure the
most appropriate application of the models.

Recent large, high severity fires in the United States,
coupled with subsequent major hydrological events,
have generated renewed interest in the linkage be-
tween fire and onsite and downstream effects (fig. 10.1).
Fire is a natural and important disturbance mecha-
nism in many ecosystems. However, the intentional
human suppression of fires in the Western United

Watershed Rehabilitation
States, beginning in the early 1900s, altered natural
fire regimes in many areas (Agee 1993). Fire suppres-
sion can allow fuel loading and forest floor material to
increase, resulting in fires of greater intensity and
extent than might have occurred otherwise (Norris
1990).
High severity fires are of particular concern because
the potential affects on soil productivity, watershed
response, and downstream sedimentation often pose
threats to human life and property. During severe fire
seasons, the USDA Forest Service and other Federal
and State land management agencies spend millions
of dollars on postfire emergency watershed rehabilita-
tion measures intended to minimize flood runoff, onsite
erosion, and offsite sedimentation and hydrologic dam-
age. Increased erosion and flooding are certainly the
most visible and dramatic impacts of fire apart from
the consumption of vegetation.
Burned Area Emergency
Rehabilitation (BAER) ____________
The first formal reports on emergency watershed
rehabilitation after wildfires were prepared in the
1960s and early 1970s, although postfire seeding with

grasses and other herbaceous species was conducted
in many areas in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s (Christ
1934, Gleason 1947). Contour furrowing and trench-
ing were used when flood control was a major concern
( Noble 1965, DeByle 1970b). The Forest Service and
other agencies had no formal emergency rehabilita-
tion program. Funds for fire suppression disturbance
were covered by fire suppression authorization. Wa-
tershed rehabilitation funding was obtained from
emergency flood control programs or, more commonly,
restoration accounts. Prior to 1974, the fiscal year had
ended June 30 of each year, allowing year-end project
funds to be shifted to early season fires. After July 1,
fires were covered by shifts in the new fiscal year
funding. The shift to an October 1 to September 30
fiscal year made it difficult to provide timely postfire
emergency treatments or create appropriated water-
shed restoration accounts.
In response to a Congressional inquiry on fiscal
accountability, in 1974 a formal authority for $2 mil-
lion in postfire rehabilitation activities was provided
in the Interior and Related Agencies appropriation.
Called Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation
(BAER), this authorization was similar to the fire
fighting funds in that it allowed the Forest Service to
use any available funds to cover the costs of watershed
treatments when an emergency need was determined
and authorized. Typically, Congress reimbursed ac-
counts used in subsequent annual appropriations.
Later, annual appropriations provided similar au-
thorities for the Bureau of Land Management and
then other Interior agencies. The occurrence of many
large fires in California and southern Oregon in 1987
caused expenditures for BAER treatments to exceed
the annual BAER authorization of $2 million. Con-
gressional committees were consulted and the funding
cap was removed. The BAER program evolved, and
policies were refined based on determining what con-
stituted a legitimate emergency warranting rehabili-
tation treatments.
The BAER-related policies were initially incorpo-
rated into the Forest Service Manual (FSM 2523) and
the Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER)
Handbook (FSH 2509.13) in 1976. These policies re-
quired an immediate assessment of site conditions
following wildfire and, where necessary, implementa-
tion of emergency rehabilitation measures. These di-
rectives delineated the objectives of the BAER pro-
gram as:
1. Minimizing the threat to life and property onsite
and offsite.
2. Reducing the loss of soil and onsite productivity.
3. Reducing the loss of control of water.
4. Reducing deterioration of water quality.
As postfire rehabilitation treatment increased, de-
bates arose over the effectiveness of grass seeding and
its negative impacts on natural regeneration. Seeding
was the most widely used individual treatment, and it
was often applied in conjunction with other hillslope
treatments, such as contour-felled logs and channel
treatments.
In the mid 1990s, a major effort was undertaken to
revise and update the BAER handbook. A steering
committee, consisting of regional BAER coordinators
and other specialists, organized and developed the
handbook used today. The issue of using native species
for emergency revegetation emerged as a major topic,
and the increased use of contour-felled logs (fig. 10.2)
and mulches caused rehabilitation expenditures to
escalate. During the busy 1996 fire season, for ex-
ample, the Forest Service spent $11 million on BAER
projects. In 2000, 2001, and 2002 the average annual
BAER spending rose to more than $50 million.
Improvements in the BAER program in the late
1990s included increased BAER training and funding
review. Increased training needs were identified for
BAER team leaders, project implementation, and on-
the-ground treatment installation. Courses were de-
veloped for the first two training needs but not the last.
Current funding requests are scrutinized by regional
and national BAER coordinators to verify that funded
projects are minimal, necessary, reasonable, practi-
cable, cost effective, and a significant improvement
over natural recovery.
In the late 1990s, a program was initiated to integrate
national BAER policies across different Federal agen-
cies (Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management,
National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, and
Bureau of Indian Affairs) as each agency had different
authorities provided in the Annual Appropriations Acts.

sion control after a wildfire. (Photo by Peter Robichaud).

The U.S. Department of Agriculture and Department of
the Interior approved a joint policy for a consistent
approach to postfire rehabilitation in 1998. The new
policy broadened the scope and application of BAER
analysis and treatment. Major changes included:
1. Monitoring to determine if additional treatment
is needed and evaluating to improve treatment
effectiveness.
2. Repairing facilities for safety reasons.
3. Stabilizing biotic communities.
4. Preventing unacceptable degradation of critical
known cultural sites and natural resources.
BAER Program Analysis
Early BAER efforts were principally aimed at con-
trolling runoff and consequently erosion. Research by
Bailey and Copeland (1961), Christ (1934), Copeland
(1961, 1968), Ferrell (1959), Heede (1960, 1970), and
Noble (1965) demonstrated that various watershed
management techniques could be used on forest, wood-
land, shrub, and grassland watersheds to control both
storm runoff and erosion (fig. 10.3). Many of these
techniques were developed from other disciplines (such
as agriculture and construction) and refined or aug-
mented to form the set of BAER treatments in use
today (table 10.1).
In spite of the improvements in the BAER process
and the wealth of practical experience obtained over
the past several decades, the effectiveness of many
emergency rehabilitation methods have not been sys-
tematically tested or validated. Measuring erosion
and runoff is expensive, complex, and labor intensive
(fig. 10.4). Few researchers or management specialists
have the resources or the energy to do it. BAER team

leaders and decisionmakers often do not have infor-
mation available to evaluate the short- and long-term
benefits (and costs) of various treatment options.
In 1998, a joint study by the USDA Forest Service
Rocky Mountain Research Station and the Pacific
Southwest Research Station evaluated the use and
effectiveness of postfire emergency rehabilitation
methods (Robichaud and others 2000).
The objectives of the study were to:
1. Evaluate the effectiveness of rehabilitation treat-
ments at reducing postwildfire erosion, runoff, or
other effects.
2. Assess the effectiveness of rehabilitation treat-
ments in mitigating the downstream effects of
increased sedimentation and peakflows.
3. Investigate the impacts of rehabilitation treat-
ments on natural processes of ecosystem recov-
ery, both in the short and long term.
4. Compare hillslope and channel treatments to one
another and to a no-treatment option.
5. Collect available information on economic, so-
cial, and environmental costs and benefits of
various rehabilitation treatment options, includ-
ing no treatment.
6. Determine how knowledge of treatments gained
in one location can be transferred to another
location.
7. Identify information gaps needing further re-
search and evaluation.
Robichaud and others (2000) collected and ana-
lyzed information on past use of BAER treatments in
order to determine attributes and conditions that led
to treatment success or failure in achieving BAER
goals. Robichaud and others (2000) restricted this
study to USDA Forest Service BAER projects in the
continental Western United States and began by
requesting Burned Area Report (FS-2500-8) forms
and monitoring reports from the Regional headquar-
ters and Forest Supervisors’ offices. The initial ef-
forts revealed that information collected on the Burned
Area Report forms and in the relatively few existing
postfire monitoring reports was not sufficient to as-
sess treatment effectiveness, nor did the information
capture the knowledge of BAER specialists. There-
fore, interview questions were designed to enable
ranking of expert opinions on treatment effective-
ness, to determine aspects of the treatments that
lead to success or failure, and to allow for comments
on various BAER-related topics.
Interview forms were developed after consultation
with several BAER specialists. The forms were used
to record information when BAER team members
and regional and national leaders were interviewed.
Onsite interviews were conducted because much of
the supporting data were located in the Forest Super-
visors’ and District Rangers’ offices and could be

182
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
retrieved during the interviews. Because much of the
information was qualitative, attempts were made to
ask questions that would allow for grouping and
ranking results.
BAER program specialists were asked to identify
treatments used on specific fires and what environ-
mental factors affected success and failure. For each
treatment, specific questions were asked regarding
the factors that caused the treatment to succeed or
fail, such as slope classes, soil type, and storm events
(rainfall intensity and duration) affecting the treated
areas. They were also asked questions regarding imple-
mentation of treatments and whether any effective-
ness monitoring was completed. For cases where moni-
toring was conducted (either formal or informal),
interviewees were asked to describe the type and
quality of the data collected (if applicable) and to give
an overall effectiveness rating of “excellent,” “good,”
“fair,” or “poor ” for each treatment.
This evaluation covered 470 fires and 321 BAER
projects, from 1973 through 1998 in USDA Forest
Service Regions 1 through 6. A literature review,
interviews with key Regional and Forest BAER spe-
cialists, analysis of burned area reports, and review of
Forest and District monitoring reports were used in
the evaluation. The resulting report, Evaluating the
Effectiveness of Postfire Rehabilitation Treatments
(Robichaud and others 2000), includes these major
sections:
1. Information acquisition and analysis methods.
2. Description of results, which include hydrologic,
erosion and risk assessments, monitoring re-
ports, and treatment evaluations.
3. Discussion of BAER assessments and treatment
effectiveness.
4. Conclusions drawn from the analysis.
5. Recommendations.
This chapter provides a synopsis of the findings in
that report, as well as new information that has been
determined since the report was published.

Postfire Rehabilitation Treatment
Decisions ______________________
The BAER Team and BAER Report
As soon as possible (even before a fire is fully con-
tained), a team of specialists is brought together to
evaluate the potential effects of the fire and to recom-
mend what postfire rehabilitation, if any, should be
used in and around the burned area. Hydrology and
soil science are the predominant disciplines repre-
sented on nearly all BAER teams. Depending on the
location, severity, and size of the fire, wildlife biolo-
gists, timber, range, and fire managers, engineers,
archeologists, fishery biologists, and contracted spe-
cialists may be included on the team.
The Burned Area Report filed by the BAER team
describes the hydrologic and soil conditions in the fire
area as well as the predicted increase in runoff, ero-
sion, and sedimentation. The basic information in-
cludes the watershed location, size, suppression cost,
vegetation, soils, geology, and lengths of stream chan-
nels, roads, and trails affected by the fire. The water-
shed descriptions include areas in low, moderate, and
high severity burn categories as well as areas with
water repellent soils. The runoff, erosion, and sedi-
mentation predictions are then evaluated in combina-
tion with both the onsite and downstream values at
risk to determine the selection and placement of emer-
gency rehabilitation treatments. The BAER team uses
data from previous fires, climate modeling, erosion
prediction tools, and professional judgment to make
the BAER recommendations.
Erosion Estimates from BAER Reports
Robichaud and others (2000) found a wide range of
potential erosion and watershed sediment yield esti-
mates in the Burned Area Report forms. Some of the
high values could be considered unrealistic (fig. 10.5).
Erosion potential varied from 1 to 6,913 tons/acre (2 to
15,500 Mg/ha), and sediment yield varied over six
orders of magnitude. Erosion potential and sediment
yield potential did not correlate well (r = 0.18, n = 117).
Different methods were used to calculate these esti-
mates on different fires, making comparisons difficult.
Methods included empirical base models such as Uni-
versal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), values based on
past estimates of known erosion events, and profes-
sional judgment. In recent years, considerable effort
has been made to improve erosion prediction after
wildfire through the development and refinement of
new models (Elliot and others 1999, 2000). These

Hydrologic Response Estimates
Evaluating the potential effects of wildfire on hydro-
logic responses is an important first step in the BAER
process. This involves determining storm magnitude,
duration, and return interval for which treatments
are to be designed. Robichaud and others (2000) found
that the most common design storms were 10-year
return events (fig. 10.6, 10.7). Storm durations were

are often reported after wildfires and are expected to
occur more commonly on coarse-grained soils, such as
those derived from granite (fig. 10.8). However, no
statistical difference was found in the geologic parent
material and the percent of burned area that was
water repellent. Robichaud and Hungerford (2000)
also found no differences in the water repellant condi-
tions with various soil types. BAER teams estimate a
percentage reduction in infiltration capacity as part of
the Burned Area Report. Comparison of reduction in
infiltration rate to percentage of area that was water
repellent showed no statistically significant relation-
ship (fig. 10.9). However, Robichaud (2000) and Pierson
and others (2001a) showed a 10 to 35 percent reduction
in infiltration after the first year. Factors other than
water repellent soil conditions, such as loss of the
protective forest floor layers, obviously affect infiltra-
tion capacity.
Estimation methods for expected changes in chan-
nel flow due to wildfire were variable but primarily
based on predicted change in infiltration rates. Thus,
a 20 percent reduction in infiltration resulted in an
estimated 20 percent increase in channel flows. Vari-
ous methods were used to determine channel flow
including empirical-based models, past U.S. Geologi-
cal Survey records from nearby watersheds that had
a flood response, and professional judgment. Some
reports show a large percent increase in design flows
(fig. 10.10).

Hillslope Treatments and
Results ________________________
Hillslope Treatments
Hillslope treatments are intended to reduce sur-
face runoff and keep postwildfire soil in place on the
hillslope and thereby prevent sediment deposition in
unwanted areas. These treatments are regarded as a
first line of defense against postfire erosion and sedi-
ment movement. Hillslope treatments comprise the
greatest portion of time, effort, and expense in most
BAER projects. Consequently, more information is
available on hillslope treatments than on channel or
road treatments.
Broadcast Seeding— The most common BAER
practice is broadcast seeding. Grass seeding after fire
for range improvement has been practiced for decades,
with the intent to gain useful products from land that
will not return to timber production for many years
(Christ 1934, McClure 1956). As an emergency treat-
ment, rapid vegetation establishment has been re-
garded as the most cost-effective method to promote
rapid infiltration of water and keep soil on hillslopes
(Noble 1965, Rice and others 1965, Miles and others
1989).
Grasses are particularly desirable for this purpose
because their extensive, fibrous root systems increase
water infiltration and hold soil in place. Fast-growing
nonnative species have typically been used. They are
inexpensive and readily available in large quantities
when an emergency arises (Barro and Conard 1987,
Miles and others 1989, Agee 1993). Legumes are often
added to seeding mixes for their ability to increase
available nitrogen in the soil after the postfire nutri-
ent flush has been exhausted, aiding the growth of
seeded grasses and native vegetation (Ratliff and
McDonald 1987). Seed mixes were refined for particu-
lar areas as germination and establishment success
were evaluated. Most mixes contained annual grasses
to provide quick cover and perennials to establish
longer term protection (Klock and others 1975, Ratliff
and McDonald, 1987). However, nonnative species
that persist can delay recovery of native flora and alter
local plant diversity. Native grass seed can be expen-
sive and hard to acquire in large quantities or in a
timely manner compared to cereal grains or pasture
grasses. When native seed is used, it should come from
a nearby source area to preserve local genetic integ-
rity. When native seed is not available, BAER special-
ists have recommended using nonreproducing annu-
als, such as cereal grains or sterile hybrids that provide
quick cover and then die out to let native vegetation
reoccupy the site.
Application of seed can be done from the air or on the
ground. In steep areas and in areas where access is
limited, aerial seeding is often the only option. Effec-
tive application of seed by fixed-wing aircraft or heli-
copter requires global positioning system (GPS) navi-
gation, significant pilot skill, and low winds for even
cover. Ground seeding, applied from all-terrain ve-
hicles or by hand, assures more even seed application
than aerial seeding. Seeding is often combined with
other treatments, such as mulching and scarifying, as
these additional treatments help anchor the seeds and
improve seed germination.
Effectiveness of seeding depends on timeliness of
seed application, choice of seed, protection from graz-
ing, and luck in having gentle rains to stimulate seed

germination before wind or heavy rains blow or wash
soil and seed away. Proper timing of seed application
depends on location. In some areas, it is best to seed
directly into dry ash, before any rain falls, to take
advantage of the fluffy seedbed condition, while in
other areas, seed is best applied after the first snow so
that it will germinate in the spring. Both conditions
also reduce loss to rodents. The potential advantage of
seeded grass to inhibit the growth and spread of
noxious weeds also depends on timely application and
germination.
Mulch—Mulch is any organic material spread over
the soil surface that functions like the organic forest
floor that is often destroyed in high and moderate
severity burn areas. Both wet mulch (hydromulch)
and dry mulch (wheat straw, jute excelsior, rice straw,
and so forth) are available; however, mulches have
only recently been used as a postfire rehabilitation
treatment. Mulch is applied alone or in combination to
reduce raindrop impact and overland flow and, thereby,
to enhance infiltration and reduce soil erosion. It is
often used in conjunction with grass seeding to provide
ground cover in critical areas. It also intercepts pre-
cipitation for subsequent infiltration. Mulch protects
the soil and improves moisture retention underneath
it, benefiting seeded plants in hot areas but not always
in cool ones. Use of straw from pasture may introduce
exotic grass seed or weeds, so BAER projects are now
likely to seek “weed-free” mulch such as rice straw.
Mulches can be applied from the air or from the
ground. Aerial dry mulching uses helicopters with
attached cargo net slings carrying the straw mulch,
which is released over the treatment area (San Dimas
Technology Development Center 2003). Hydromulch
can be applied from the air using helicopters fitted
with hydromulch slurry tanks or buckets, which are
released in controlled drops over the treatment areas.
Both of these aerial applications are expensive. Ground
application of dry mulch is done by hand using all
terrain vehicles to carry the straw from a staging area
into the treatment area. Ground application of
hydromulch is done from spray trucks and is limited to
an area 200 feet (61 m) of either side of a road. Given
its expense, mulch is usually used in high value areas,
such as above or below roads, above streams, or below
ridge tops.
Mulching is most effective on gentle slopes and in
areas where high winds are not likely to occur. Wind
either blows the mulch off site or piles it so deeply that
seed germination is inhibited. On steep slopes, rain can
wash some of the mulch material downslope. Use of a
tackifier or felling small trees across the mulch may
increase onsite retention. Hydromulches often have
tackifiers that help bind the mulch in the soil. Both
hydromulch and dry mulch were used to stabilize soils
on the Cerro Grande Fire of 2000 and Rodeo-Chediski
and Hayman Fires of 2002. However, use of these
treatments escalated the BAER treatment costs to $10
to $20 million per fire.
Contour Log Structures (Contour Log Basins,
Log Erosion Barriers, Log Terraces, Terracettes)—
This treatment involves felling logs on burned-over
hillsides and laying them on the ground along the
slope contour to provide mechanical barriers to water
flow, promote infiltration, and reduce sediment move-
ment. Contour-felled logs reduce water velocity, break
up concentrated flows, induce hydraulic roughness to
burned watersheds, and store sediment. The potential
volume of sediment stored is highly dependent on
slope, the layout design, the size and length of the
felled trees, and the degree to which the felled trees are
adequately staked and placed into ground contact. In
some instances contour-felled log barriers have filled
with sediment following the first several storm events
after installation, while others have taken 1 to 2 years
to fill (Robichaud 2000).
This treatment was originally designed to provide
the same function as contour trenches and furrows.
The primary function of the Contour Log Basins or
Contour Log Terraces was to detain and infiltrate
runoff from a design storm. To accomplish this, logs
ranging generally from 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) in
diameter were felled on the contour and staked in
place. The treatment was begun at the top of the slope
because each course of contour logs depends on the
design spacing and capacity of the upslope courses to
be effective. The spacing depends on the capacity of the
structure to contain runoff according to the formula:
S = RO/12 x C
Where: S = spacing of log courses down slope measured
horizontally in feet.
RO = Storm runoff in inches.
C = Basin capacity in cubic feet/lineal foot of log.
Basins were created behind each log by scraping soil
against the log to seal it. Earthen end sills and baffles
complete the structure. To contain 1.0 inch (25 mm) of
runoff typically requires spacing of less than 20 feet
(9.6 m) between courses. Contour placement is vital,
and eliminating long, uninterrupted flow paths by
“brick coursing” provides additional effectiveness. The
treatments detain storm runoff on site, thereby elimi-
nating transport of eroded soils. If the design capacity
is exceeded, the structure provides some secondary
benefit by reducing slope length, which interrupts
concentrated flows and sediment movement. Because
of their small size, the effective life of properly in-
stalled treatments is only a few years at most. Unde-
signed and underdesigned treatments with wide spac-
ing and lacking runoff storage capacity can effectively
concentrate runoff and cause damage that might

USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
187
conceivably be greater than no treatment. In high
rainfall areas of the West Coast, contour log basins
may be infeasible. In these cases, contour logs are
placed in the same manner as above, but the exception
is that they will provide only secondary benefits. It
should be kept in mind that these structures are
intended to detain runoff. If they immediately fill with
sediment, they were likely underdesigned.
Shallow, rocky soils that are uneven are problem-
atic for anchoring, so care must be taken to ensure
that logs are adequately secured to the slope. Overly
rocky and steep slopes should be avoided because
benefits gained from contour-felling treatment can
be easily offset by the extra implementation time
required and the limited capacity to detain runoff or
provide stabilization of small amounts of soil. Gen-
tler slopes and finer textured soils (except clayey
soils) lead to better installation and greater runoff
control efficiency. In highly erosive soils derived from
parent material such as granitics or glacial till, so
much sediment can be mobilized that it might over-
whelm small contour-felled logs. Availability of ad-
equate numbers of straight trees must be considered
when choosing this treatment.
Straw Wattles—Straw wattles main purpose is to
break up slope length and reduce flow velocities of
concentrated flow. Straw wattles are 9 to 10 inches (23
to 25 cm) in diameter and made of nylon mesh tubes
filled with straw. They are permeable barriers used to
detain surface runoff long enough to reduce flow veloc-
ity and provide for sediment storage. With end sills,
baffles, and on the proper design spacing, straw wattles
can provide runoff detention.
Straw wattles have been used in small, first order,
drainages or on side slopes for detaining small amounts
of sediment. They should never be placed in main or
active drainages. Straw wattles function similarly to
contour-felled logs. The sediment holding capacity can
be increased by turning 2 feet at each end of the wattle
upslope. Straw wattles are a good alternative in burned
areas where logs are absent, poorly shaped, or scarce.
Straw wattles are relatively inexpensive, but they can
be disturbed by grazing animals or decompose or catch
fire. Although the wattle netting is photodegradable,
there are concerns that it persists long enough to pose
hazards for small animals.
Contour Trenching and Terraces—Full-scale
contour trenches are designed to totally detain the
runoff from a design storm on site. The treatment
must progress from the top of the slope downward as
each trench course is dependent on the next one
upslope. Smaller “outside” trenches can be constructed
on slopes less than 30 percent. For slopes greater than
30 percent an “inside” trench must be built. This re-
quires building a “full bench” platform for bulldozers
to operate on. In subsequent passes, the trench is
tipped into the slope, forming a basin. On the final
pass, bulldozers back out and push up baffles that
segment the trench and allow flows to equalize into
other cells. The formula for digging trenches is:
S = RO/12 x C
Where: S = spacing of trench courses down slope
measured horizontally in feet.
RO = Storm runoff in inches.
C = Basin capacity in cubic feet/lineal foot of trench.
The practical upper limit of capacity is about 3
inches (76 mm) of runoff. Contour trenches require a
minimum of 4 feet (1.2 m) of soil above bedrock for
adequate construction. They work best in gravelly
loams and have been applied in granitic soils and clay
soils with less success (Schmidt Personal Communica-
tion 2004). Granitic soils do not maintain a structural
shape well because of their coarseness and difficulty to
get regenerated with cover. Clay soils can become
plastic with the addition of water, and in landslide-
prone topography, contour trenches can activate local-
ized mass failures. Contour trenching has proven to be
effective in a number of localities in the past, but
concerns about visual effects and cultural heritage
values have limited their use in the past three de-
cades.
More recently, smaller scale contour trenches have
been used to break up the slope surface, to slow runoff,
to allow infiltration, and to trap sediment. These
trenches or terraces are often used in conjunction with
other treatments such as seeding. They can be con-
structed with machinery (deeper trenches) or by hand
(generally shallow). Width and depth vary with design
storm, spacing, soil type, and slope. When installed
with heavy equipment, trenches may result in consid-
erable soil disturbance that can create immediate
erosion problems. In addition, erosion problems can
occur many years after installation when runoff cuts
through the trench embankment. Trenches have high
visual impact when used in open areas. Shallow hand
trenches tend to disappear with time as they are filled
with sediment and covered by vegetation. On the other
hand, large trenches installed several decades ago are
still visible on the landscape. Because contour trench-
ing and terraces are ground-disturbing activities, cul-
tural clearances are required, and these may signifi-
cantly slow the installation process.
Scarification and Ripping—Scarification and rip-
ping are mechanical soil treatments aimed at improv-
ing infiltration rates in water repellent soils. Tractors
and ATVs can be used to pull shallow harrows on
slopes of 20 percent or less. Hand scarification uses
steel rakes (McLeods). These treatments may increase
the amount of macropore space in soils by the physical

188
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
breakup of dense or water repellent soils, and thus
increase the amount of rainfall that infiltrates into the
soil. In addition, scarification can provide a seedbed
for planting that improves germination rates. Shallow
soils, rock outcrops, steep slopes, incised drainages,
fine-textured soils, and high tree density create sig-
nificant problems for scarification and ripping. These
treatments work best where there is good soil depth,
the soils are coarse textured, slopes are less than 30
percent, and woody vegetation density is low.
Silt Fences—Silt fences are installed to trap sedi-
ment in swales, small ephemeral drainages, or along
hillslopes where they provide temporary sediment
storage. Given the labor-intensive installation, they
are used as treatment only when other methods would
not be effective. They work best on gentler slopes, such
as swales, but can be effective on steeper, rocky slopes
where log erosion barriers would not achieve good
ground contact. Silt fences are also installed to moni-
tor sediment movement as part of effectiveness moni-
toring and can last several years before UV breakdown
of the fabric (Robichaud and Brown 2002).
Geotextiles and Geowebbing—Polymer textiles
and webbings are used to cover ground and control
erosion in high-risk areas, such as extremely steep
slopes, above roads or structures, or along streambanks.
This material is often used in conjunction with seed-
ing. Geotextiles come in different grades with ultra-
violet inhibitors that determine how long they will last
in the field. Geotextiles must be anchored securely to
remain effective, especially along streambanks. The
complete cover provided by some geotextiles can re-
duce native plant establishment.
Sand, Soil, or Gravel Bags—Sand, soil, or gravel
bags are used on hillslopes or in small channels or to
trap sediment and interrupt water flow. Various seed
mixes or willow wands may be added to the bags to
help establish vegetation. The bags are often placed in
staggered rows like contour-felled logs in areas where
there are no trees available. Rows of bags break water
flow and promote infiltration. They store sediment
temporarily, then break down and release it. They are
not appropriate for use in V-shaped channels.
Temporary Fencing—Temporary fencing is used
to keep grazing livestock and off-highway vehicles
(OHVs) out of burned areas and riparian zones during
the recovery period. Resprouting onsite vegetation
and seeded species attract grazing animals and re-
quire protection to be successful.
Slash Spreading—Slash spreading covers the
ground with organic material, interrupting rain im-
pact and trapping soil. It is a common practice after
timber sales, but it can also be used on burned slopes
where dead vegetation is present. Slash is often used
to rehabilitate firebreaks and dozer firelines. It is also
used in moderately burned areas where there is more
material available to spread, or below an intensely
burned slope or area of water repellent soils. To be
effective, slash needs to be cut so it makes good contact
with the ground.
Needle Cast—Needle cast commonly occurs after
low and moderate severity burns in coniferous forests.
The dead needles that fall to the ground provide
surface cover that functions as a naturally occurring
mulch. Pannkuk and Robichaud (2003) indicate that
50 percent ground cover can reduce interrill erosion by
60 to 80 percent and rill erosion 20 to 40 percent.
Although needle cast is not an applied treatment, its
presence may reduce or eliminate the need for other
treatments.
Hillslope Treatment Effectiveness
Increasing infiltration of rainfall and preventing
soil from leaving the hillslope are considered the most
effective methods to slow runoff, reduce flood peaks,
retain site productivity, and reduce downstream sedi-
mentation. Many of these hillslope treatments may be
appropriate in critical areas of high risk. Monitoring of
treatment effectiveness is needed to determine which
treatments will work in specific settings as well as
their cost effectiveness (General Accounting Office
2003, Robichaud and others 2003).
BAER Expert Rating—Hillslope treatments are
implemented to keep soil in place and comprise the
greatest effort in most BAER projects (fig. 10.2). Mulch-
ing and geotextiles were rated the most effective
hillslope treatments because they provide immediate
ground cover to reduce raindrop impact and overland
flow as well as to hold soil in place. Mulching was rated
“excellent” in 67 percent of the evaluations, and no-
body considered it a “poor” treatment. Aerial seeding,
the most frequently used BAER treatment, was rated
about equally across the spectrum from “excellent” to
“poor.” Nearly 82 percent of the evaluations placed
ground seeding effectiveness in the “good” category.
Evaluations of seeding plus fertilizer covered the spec-
trum from “excellent” to “poor,” although most re-
sponses were “fair” or “poor.” After seeding, contour-
felled logs are the next most commonly applied hillslope
treatment. The rating for contour-felled logs was “ex-
cellent” or “good” in 66 percent of the evaluations. The
remainder of the hillslope treatments received only
three evaluations each, so no conclusions are offered
beyond the fact that they were generally rated “excel-
lent,” “good,” or “fair,” and none were evaluated as
“poor.”

Research and Monitoring Results
Broadcast Seeding—Robichaud and others (2000)
reviewed published studies of seeding effectiveness
after 1 and 2 years on 34 burned sites across the
Western United States. Erosion was not measured at
16 sites (47 percent); only plant cover was determined.
At another 15 of the seeding sites (44 percent), seeding
did not significantly reduce erosion when compared to
sites that were burned but not seeded. Soil erosion was
reduced by seeding on only three sites (16, 31, and 80
percent less sediment). Of 23 monitoring reports that
contained some quantitative data on broadcast seed-
ing, 15 (65 percent) did not determine soil loss, and one
reported no difference in erosion due to seeding. Three
reports noted reductions in sediment yield of 30 to 36
percent (2.6 to 6.2 tons/acre or 5.8 to 13.8 Mg/ha). Four
monitoring reports documented increases of sediment
yield on seeded areas of 118 to 386 percent of that of
burned and untreated areas.
In the studies and monitoring reports examined by
Robichaud and others (2000), a wide variety of grass
species, mixes, and application rates were used, mak-
ing generalizations difficult. However, in some of the
reported studies it is noted that grass seeding does not
assure increased plant cover (or any associated ero-
sion reduction) during the first critical year after fire.
In the mid-1900s, southern California foresters were
urged to caution the public not to expect significant
first-year sediment control from postfire seeding
(Gleason 1947). Krammes (1960), in southern Califor-
nia, found that as much as 90 percent of first-year
postfire hillslope sediment movement can occur as dry
ravel before the first germination-stimulating rains
even occur. Amaranthus (1989) measured the  most
first-year sediment movement on his Oregon study
site during several storms in December, before the
seeded ryegrass had produced much cover. In the
reported studies, erosion was decreased by seeding in
only one out of eight first-year studies (12.5 percent).
However, several studies showed a trend toward lower
sediment movement on seeded plots that was not
statistically significant (Amaranthus 1989,
Wohlgemuth and others 1998). One report suggested
that measures other than seeding should be used in
places where first-year control of sediment movement
is critical (Ruby 1997).
Better cover and, consequently, greater erosion con-
trol may occur by the second postfire year. Amaranthus
(1989) reported that in the second year after fire,
seeded sites had greater total cover (plant and litter)
than unseeded 42 percent of the time. Seeded species
are expected to be of greatest value during the second
and third rainy seasons (Esplin and Shackleford 1978),
when plant litter produced by the first year’s growth
covers the soil. However, after the Bobcat Fire in the
Colorado Front Range, Wagenbrenner (2003) found
that seeding had no significant effect on sediment
yields at the hillslope scale in either the first or second
years. In addition, seeding had no significant effect on
percent of vegetative cover compared to untreated
areas (Wagenbrenner 2003).
Seeding is often most successful where it may be
needed least—on gentle slopes and in riparian areas.
Janicki (1989) found that two-thirds of plots with more
than 30 percent annual ryegrass cover were on slopes
of less than 35 percent. He also noted that grass plants
concentrated in drainage bottoms indicating that seed
washed off the slopes during the first two storm events.
Concentration of seeded species at the base of slopes
was also observed by Loftin and others (1998).
Little evidence suggests that fertilizer applied with
seeded grass is effective in increasing cover or reduc-
ing erosion after fire. Several studies found no signifi-
cant effect of fertilizer on plant cover or erosion (Cline
and Brooks 1979, Esplin and Shackleford 1980, Tyrrel
1981).
Retention of soil onsite for productivity maintenance
is an important rehabilitation treatment objective, but
almost no evidence indicates whether seeding is effec-
tive in meeting this goal. Although some nutrients are
inevitably lost in a fire, natural processes tend to
replenish the soil over time (DeBano and others 1998).
Mulch—Straw mulch applied at a rate of 0.9 ton/
acre (2 Mg/ha) significantly reduced sediment yield on
burned pine-shrub forest in Spain over an 18-month
period with 46 rainfall events (Bautista and others
1996). Kay (1983) tested straw mulch laid down at
rates of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 4 tons/acre (1.1, 2.2, 3.4, and
9.0 Mg/ha) against jute excelsior, and paper for erosion
control. Straw was the most cost-effective mulch, su-
perior in protection to hydraulic mulches and compa-
rable to expensive fabrics. Excelsior was less effective
but better than paper strip synthetic yarn. The best
erosion control came from jute applied over 1.5 tons/
acre (3.4 Mg/ha) straw. Miles and others (1989) stud-
ied the use of wheat straw mulch on the 1987 South
Fork of the Trinity River Fire, Shasta-Trinity Na-
tional Forest in California. Wheat straw mulch was
applied to fill slopes adjacent to perennial streams,
firelines, and areas of extreme erosion hazard. Mulch
applied at rates of 1.0 to 2.0 tons/acre (2.2 to 4.5 Mg/ha)
on large areas, reduced erosion significantly 4.6 to 8.0
yard3/acre (11 to 19 m3/ha). They considered mulching
highly effective in controlling erosion. Edwards and
others (1995) examined the effects of straw mulching
at rates of 0.9, 1.8, 2.6, and 3.6 tons/acre (2, 4, 6, and
8 Mg/ ha) on 5 to 9 percent slopes. They reported a
significant reduction in soil loss at 0.9 ton/acre (2 Mg/
ha) mulch, but increases in mulch thickness provided
no additional reduction in soil loss. When comparing
all the treatments used after the 2000 Cerro Grande
Fire in New Mexico, mulching provided the best

rehabilitation results. Although precipitation during
the two study years was below normal, the plots
treated with aerial seed and straw mulch yielded 70
percent less sediment than the no-treatment plots in
the first year and 95 percent less in the second year.
Ground cover transects showed that aerial seeding
without added straw mulch provided no appreciable
increase in ground cover relative to untreated plots
(Dean 2001). In a 2-year postfire study in the Colorado
Front Range, Wagenbrenner (2003) found that mulch-
ing reduced the erosion significantly from storms with
return periods of up to 2 years. In the first study year,
sediment yields from a high intensity (1.9 inches/hour,
48 mm/hour) rainfall event overwhelmed the silt fence
sediment traps on both the treated and untreated
study sites. However, in the second year, sediment
yields from mulched hillslope sites were significantly
less than the sediment yields from untreated slopes
and the slopes that were seeded without mulch
(Wagenbrenner 2003).
Contour Structures—Contour structures provide
immediate benefits after installation in that they trap
sediment during the first postfire year, which usually
has the highest erosion rates. The ability of contour
structures to reduce runoff and rilling, increase infil-
tration, and decrease downstream time-to-peak (slow-
ing velocities) has not been documented, even though
these are reasons often given for doing contour felling.
If contour structures slow or eliminate runoff, sedi-
ment movement may not occur.
Logs were contour-felled on 22 acres (9 ha) of the
1979 Bridge Creek Fire, Deschutes National Forest in
Oregon (McCammon and Hughes 1980). Trees 6 to 12
inches (150 to 300 mm) d.b.h. were placed and secured
on slopes up to 50 percent at intervals of 10 to 20 feet
(3 to 6 m). Logs were staked and holes underneath
were filled. After the first storm event, about 63
percent of the contour-felled logs were judged effective
in trapping sediment. The remainder were either
partially effective or did not receive flow. Nearly 60
percent of the storage space behind contour-felled logs
was full to capacity, 30 percent was half-full, and 10
percent had insignificant deposition. Common fail-
ures included flow under the log and not placing the
logs on contour (more than 25 degrees off contour
caused trap efficiency to decrease to 20 percent). More
than 1,600 yard3 (1,225 m3) of material was estimated
to be trapped behind contour-felled logs on the treated
area, or about 73 yard3/acre (135 m3/ha). Less than 1
yard3 (1 m3) of sediment was deposited in the intake
pond for a municipal water supply below.
The few monitoring studies done on contour-felled
log treatments did not evaluate runoff, infiltration, or
sediment movement changes after treatment installa-
tion; they only reported sediment storage. For example,
Miles and others (1989) monitored contour-felling
on the 1987 South Fork Trinity River Fires, Shasta-
Trinity National Forest in California. The treatment
was applied to 200 acres (80 ha) within 50,000 acres
(20,240 ha) of a burned area. Trees less than 10 inches
(250 mm) d.b.h. spaced 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 m) apart
were felled at rate of 80 to 100 trees/acre (200 to 250
trees/ha). The contour-felled logs trapped 0 to 0.07
yard3 (0 to 0.05 m3) of soil per log, retaining 1.6 to 6.7
yard3/acre (3 to 13 m3/ha) of soil onsite. Miles and
others (1989) considered sediment trapping efficiency
low, and the cost high for this treatment. Sediment
deposition below treated areas was not measured.
McCammon and Hughes (1980), on the other hand,
estimated storage at just over 10 times the amounts
reported by Miles and others (1989) using a higher
density of logs. Depending on log barrier density and
erosion rates, this treatment could trap 5 to 47 percent
annual sediment production from high severity burn
areas. This wide range of effectiveness indicates the
need for proper estimation techniques of the erosion
potential and for properly designing contour-felled log
installations in terms of log numbers and spacing. If 60
percent or more of the expected sediment production
can be trapped, then contour-felled logs are probably
cost effective.
Dean (2001) found that plots treated with contour-
felled logs as well as aerial seed and straw mulch
yielded 77 percent less sediment in the first year and
96 percent in the second year as compared to un-
treated areas; however, these results were not signifi-
cantly different from the straw mulch with seed treat-
ment alone. Recent postfire rehabilitation monitoring
efforts for six paired watersheds have indicated that
contour-felled logs can be effective for low to moderate
rainfall intensity storm events. However, during high
intensity rainfall events, their effectiveness is greatly
reduced. The effectiveness of contour-felled logs de-
creases over time. Once the sediment storage area
behind the log is filled, the barrier can no longer trap
sediment that is moving downslope (Robichaud 2000,
Wagenbrenner 2003).
Contour Trenching—Contour trenches have been
used as a rehabilitation treatment to reduce erosion,
increase infiltration, trap sediment, and permit reveg-
etation of fire-damaged watersheds. Although they do
increase infiltration rates, the amounts are dependent
on soils and geology (DeByle 1970b). Contour trenches
can significantly improve revegetation by trapping
more snow, but they do not affect water yield to any
appreciable extent (Doty 1970, 1972). This treatment
can be effective in altering the hydrologic response
from short duration, high intensity storms typical of
summer thunderstorms. However, this hillslope treat-
ment does not significantly change peakflows result-
ing from low intensity, long duration rainfall events
(DeByle 1970a).

USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
191
Doty (1971) noted that contour trenching in the
sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) portion (upper 15 percent
with the harshest sites) of a watershed in central Utah
did not significantly change streamflow and stormflow
patterns. Doty did not discuss changes in sediment
yields. There were no observable changes in seasonal
flows or the total flow volumes. However, the storm
peakflows were substantially reduced. Costales and
Costales (1984) reported on the use of contour trench-
ing on recently burned steep slopes (40 to 50 percent)
with clay loam soils in pine stands of the Philippines.
Contour trenching reduced sediment yield by 81 per-
cent of comparable, burned, but untreated areas.
Other Treatments—Straw wattles may detain sur-
face runoff, reduce velocities, store sediment, and
provide a seedbed for germination. They are a good
alternative in burned areas where logs are absent,
poorly shaped, or scarce. Although the wattle netting
is photodegradable, there are concerns that it persists
long enough to pose hazards for small animals.
Cattle exclusion with temporary fencing can be
important for the first two postfire years.
Ripping and scarification is effective on roads,
trails, and firebreaks with slopes less than 35 per-
cent. Slash spreading is effective if good ground
contact is maintained.
Channel Treatments and
Results ________________________
Channel Treatments
In general, channel treatments need to be coupled
with hillslope treatments to be really effective. Chan-
nel treatments are implemented to modify sediment
and water movement in ephemeral or small-order
channels to prevent flooding and debris torrents that
may affect downstream values at risk. Some in-chan-
nel structures are placed and secured to slow water
flow and allow sediment to settle out; sediment will
later be released gradually as the structure decays.
Channel clearing is done to remove large objects that
might become mobilized in a flood. Much less informa-
tion has been published on channel treatments than
on hillslope methods.
Straw Bale Check Dams—These structures are
used to prevent or reduce sediment inputs into peren-
nial streams during the first winter or rainy season
following a wildfire. Straw bales function by decreas-
ing water velocity and detaining sediment-laden sur-
face runoff long enough for coarser sediments to drop
out and be deposited behind the check dams. The
decreased water velocity also reduces downcutting in
ephemeral channels. Straw bale check dams are tem-
porary in-channel grade control structures constructed
of commercially available straw or hay bales. They are
inexpensive, easy to install, and effective at trapping
sediment but eventually deteriorate due to climatic
conditions, streamflows, or cattle and wildlife distur-
bance. Straw bale check dams tend to fail in large
storms. Failure can occur if the dams are poorly
installed or put in locations where they cannot contain
runoff. Straw bales are often used where materials are
not available on site to construct check dams.
Log Check Dams—Log check dams are another
type of temporary in-channel grade control structure
similar in function to straw bale check dams. They are
used to prevent or reduce sediment inputs into peren-
nial streams during the first winter or rainy season
following a wildfire. Log dams are constructed of more
durable material than straw bale dams, usually small
diameter fire-killed tree stems that are available
nearby. Log check dams function by decreasing water
velocity and detaining sediment-laden surface runoff
long enough for coarser sediments to deposit behind
check dams. Decreased water velocity also reduces
downcutting in ephemeral channels. Log check dams
require more effort and skill to install, but will last
longer than straw bale check dams.
Rock Dams and Rock Cage Gabions—Also known
as rock fence check dams, these structures are used in
intermittent or small perennial channels to replace
large woody debris that may have been burned out
during a wildfire. The rock cage dams provide a degree
of grade stability and reduce flow velocities long enough
to trap coarse sediments. Properly designed and in-
stalled rock check dams and rock cage (gabion) dams
are semipermanent structures capable of halting gully
development and reducing sediment yields by control-
ling channel grade and stopping head cutting of gul-
lies. The rock cage dams must be properly sited, keyed
in, and anchored to stay in place during runoff events.
The dam cages should be filled with angular rock that
will interlock, preventing rock from mobilizing and
pounding itself apart in the cages. Downslope energy
dissipaters are recommended because they reduce the
risk of the rock cage dams being undercut. Construc-
tion of these structures is dependent on the availabil-
ity of adequate amounts and sizes of rocks. Rock cage
dams usually need to be cleaned out periodically if
they are to maintain their effectiveness.
Straw Wattle Dams—Straw wattle dams work on
the same principle as straw bale check dams. They
trap sediment on side slopes and in the upper ends of
ephemeral drainages by reducing channel gradient.
Straw wattles are easy to place in contact with the
soil—a distinct advantage over rigid barriers like
logs—and provide a low risk barrier to soil movement.
The closer together straw wattles are placed in steep
terrain, the more effective they are in detaining

192
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
sediment. Wattles can be used quite effectively in
combination with straw bale check dams. However,
they should not be placed in the channels of first order
or greater drainages and swales because of high fail-
ure rates. They are most effective on hillslopes.
Log Grade Stabilizers—The purpose of log grade
stabilizers is much the same as log dams, except that
the emphasis is on stabilizing the channel gradient
rather than trapping sediment. Numerous small log
grade stabilizers are preferable to a few larger ones. In
some locations, there might not be adequate, straight,
woody material left after a fire to build log grade
stabilizers with onsite resources.
Rock Grade Stabilizers— Rock grade stabilizers
function the same as log grade stabilizers, except that
they are made of rock. The emphasis is on stabilizing
the channel gradient rather than trapping sediment
although some sediment will be trapped by these
structures. Effectiveness is impacted by (1) the use of
rocks that are large enough to resist transport during
runoff events and (2) placement of screening to collect
and hold organic debris or sediment on the upstream
side of the grade stabilizer.
Channel Debris Clearing—Channel clearing is
the removal of logs, organic debris, or sediment depos-
its to prevent them from being mobilized in debris
flows or flood events. This treatment has been done to
prevent creation of channel debris dams, which might
result in flash floods or increase flood heights or
peakflows. Organic debris can lead to culvert failure
by blocking inlets or reducing channel flow capacity.
Excessive sediments in stream channels can compro-
mise in-channel storage capacity and the function of
debris basins.
Streambank 
Armoring 
and 
Channel
Armoring—Streambank and channel armoring is
done to prevent erosion of channel banks and bottoms
during runoff events. In some hydrologic systems,
streambanks are a major source of sediment. Factors
that contribute to the success of these treatments
include proper sized materials, use of geotextile fabric,
avoiding overly steep areas, and the use of energy
dissipaters.
In-Channel Felling—This rehabilitation channel
treatment is designed to replace woody material in
drainage bottoms that have been consumed by wild-
fire. It is intended to trap organic debris and tempo-
rarily detain or slow down storm runoff. Woody mate-
rial felled into channels will ultimately alter channel
gradient and may cause sediment deposition and chan-
nel aggradation. This treatment is in conflict with
channel removal of woody debris as its objectives are
totally different.
Debris Basins— Debris basins are constructed in
stream systems that, under normal conditions, carry
high sediment loads. They are intended to control
runoff and reduce deterioration of water quality and
threats to human life and property. Debris basins are
considered a last resort because they are extremely
expensive to construct and require a commitment to
annual maintenance until they are abandoned. In
order for debris basins to function, they must be able
to trap at least 50 percent and preferably 70 to 80
percent of 100-year flows. A spillway needs to be
constructed in the debris basin to safely release flow in
excess of the design storage capacity. The downstream
channel should be lined to prevent scour (fig. 10.11. In
some instances, excavated pits in ephemeral channels
have been used as debris basins. These must be large
enough to trap 50 to 90 percent of flood flow. Mainte-
nance is a key factor in effectiveness of this treatment.
Although protection is immediate, maintaining debris
basins is a long-term commitment.
Channel Treatment Effectiveness
BAER Expert Ratings—Effectiveness ratings for
straw bale check dams and log grade stabilizers ranged
relatively evenly from “excellent” to “poor” (table 10.2).
While most interviewees (71 percent) thought that
channel debris clearing effectiveness fell into the “good”
category, 29 percent rated it “poor.” Log dams and
straw wattle dams were rated “excellent” or “good” in
effectiveness and better than rock grade stabilizers.
No one considered the effectiveness of these rehabili-
tation treatments to be “poor.”

Channel Treatment Research and Monitoring
Results—Here we look at various results of interest
to researchers and land managers.
Straw bale check dams: Straw bale check dams are
designed to reduce sediment inputs into streams.
They often fill in the first few storms, so their effective-
ness diminishes quickly, and they can blow out during
high flows. Thus, their usefulness is short-lived. Miles
and others (1989) reported on the results of installing
1,300 straw bale check dams after the 1987 South Fork
Trinity River Fires, Shasta-Trinity National Forest in
California. Most dams were constructed with five
bales. About 13 percent of the straw bale check dams
failed due to piping under or between bales or under-
cutting of the central bale. Each dam stored an aver-
age 1.1 yard3 (0.8 m3) of sediment. Miles and others
(1989) reported that filter fabric on the upside of each
dam and a spillway apron would have increased effec-
tiveness. They considered straw bale check dams easy
to install and highly effective when they did not fail.
Collins and Johnston (1995) evaluated the effec-
tiveness of straw bales on sediment retention after
the Oakland Hills fire. About 5,000 bales were in-
stalled in 440 straw bale check dams and 100 hillslope
barriers. Three months after installation, 43 to 46
percent of the check dams were functioning. This
decreased to 37 to 43 percent by 4.5 months, at which
time 9 percent were side cut, 22 percent were under-
cut, 30 percent had moved, 24 percent were filled, 12
percent were unfilled, and 3 percent were filled but
cut. Sediment storage amounted to 55 yard3 (42 m3)
behind all the straw bale check dams and another 122
yard3 (93 m3) on an alluvial fan.
Goldman and others (1986) recommended that the
drainage area for straw bale check dams be kept to less
than 20 acres (8 ha). Bales usually last less than 3
months, flow should not be greater than 11feet3/sec
(0.3 m3/sec), and bales should be removed when sedi-
ment depth upstream is one-half of bale height. More
damage can result from failed barriers than if no
barrier were installed (Goldman and others 1986).
Log check dams: Log dams can trap sediment by
decreasing velocities and allowing coarse sediment to
drop out. However, if these structures fail, they
usually aggravate erosion problems. Logs 12 to 18
inches (300 to 450 mm) diameter were used to build
14 log check dams that retained from 1.5 to 93 yard3
(mean 29 yard3) (1.1 to 71 m3; mean 22 m3) of sedi-
ment after the 1987 South Fork Trinity River Fires
on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in California

(Miles and others 1989). While log check dams have
a high effectiveness rating and 15 to 30 years of life
expectancy (Miles and others 1989), they are costly to
install.
Rock dams and rock cage gabions: Heede (1970,
1976) reported that these structures can reduce sedi-
ment yields by 60 percent or more. Although these
cross-channel structures are relatively expensive, they
can be used in conjunction with vegetation treatments
to reduce erosion by 80 percent and suspended sedi-
ment concentrations by 95 percent (Heede 1981). While
vegetation treatments, such as grassed waterways,
augment rock check dams and are less expensive,
their maintenance costs are considerably greater.
On mild gradients, these structures work well.
Some failures occurred on steeper slopes when high
velocity flows are greater than 3 feet3/sec (1 m3/sec).
This is a common theme for all channel treatments.
Most of the failures occur where treatments are
imposed on steep gradient sections of ephemeral or
first to second order perennial channels. Rock cage
dams often last long enough and trap enough fine
sediments to provide microsites for woody riparian
vegetation to get reestablished.
Check dams constructed in Taiwan watersheds with
annual sediment yields of 10 to 30 yard3/acre (19 to 57
m3/ha) filled within 2 to 3 years. Sediment yield rates
decreased upstream of the check dams but were offset
by increased scouring downstream (Chiun-Ming 1985).
Other channel treatments: No published informa-
tion was found on the effectiveness of straw wattle
dams, log grade stabilizers, rock grade stabilizers, in-
channel debris basins, in-channel debris clearing,
streambank armoring, or other channel rehabilitation
treatments. However, several considerations have been
related to the effectiveness of these treatments.
Log and rock grade stabilizers emphasize channel
stabilization rather than storing sediment. They
tend to work for low and moderate flows, not high
flows.
Channel clearing (removing logs and other organic
debris) was rated “good” 71 percent of the time because
it prevents logs from being mobilized in debris flow or
floods. Nonetheless, use of this treatment has declined
since the early 1990s (and in-channel felling has
increased) because in-stream woody debris has been
clearly linked to improved fish habitat. Despite the
lack of effectiveness data for rock cage dams, they do
provide grade stability and reduce velocities enough to
drop out coarse sediment. Debris basins are designed
to store runoff and sediment and are often used to
prevent downstream flooding and sedimentation in
the Southwestern United States. They are usually
designed to trap 50 to 70 percent of the expected flows.
Road and Trail Treatments and
Results ________________________
Road and Trail Treatments
Road rehabilitation treatments consist of a variety
of practices aimed at increasing the water and sedi-
ment processing capabilities of roads and road struc-
tures, such as culverts and bridges, in order to prevent
large cut-and-fill failures and the movement of sedi-
ment downstream. The functionality of the road drain-
age system is not affected by fire, but the increased
stream and storm flows in a burned-over watershed
can exceed the functionality of that system. Road
treatments are not designed to retain water and sedi-
ment but rather to manage water’s erosive forces and
avoid damage to the road structures.
Rolling Dips/Waterbars/Cross Drain/Culvert
Overflow/Bypass—These treatments are designed
to provide drainage relief for road sections or water in
the inside ditch to the downhill side of roads especially
when the existing culvert is expected to be over-
whelmed. Rolling dips are easily constructed with
road grader, dozer, or backhoe. Rolling dips or
waterbars need to be deep enough to contain the
expected flow and location carefully assessed to pre-
vent damages to other portions of the road prism.
Waterbars can be made out of rocks or logs, but they
are not as effective as earthen bars placed diagonally
across roads to divert runoff away from the road
surface. Armoring of dip and fillslope at the outlet is
often needed to prevent incision and gullying.
Culvert Upgrades—Culvert improvements in-
crease the flow capacity, which may prevent road
damage. Upgraded culverts need to be sized and in-
stalled (approaches, exits, and slope) to handle ex-
pected increased flows. Flexible down spouts and
culvert extensions often are needed to keep exiting
water from highly erodible slopes.
Culvert Inlet/Outlet Armoring/Risers—These
treatments reduce scouring around the culvert en-
trance and exit. They allow heavy particles to settle
out of sediment-laden water and reduce the chance of
debris plugging the culvert. Culvert risers allow for
sediment accumulation while allowing water to flow
through the culvert. Sometimes culvert risers can clog
and may be difficult to clean.
Culvert Removal—This procedure is a planned
removal of undersized culverts that would probably
fail due to increased flows. After culvert removal,
armoring the stream crossing will allow for continued
use of the road. If the road is not needed, culvert
removal is done in conjunction with road obliteration.

USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
195
Trash Racks—Trash racks are installed to prevent
debris from clogging culverts or down-stream struc-
tures. These structures are generally built out of logs
but occasionally from milled lumber or metal, and they
are anchored to the sides and bottom of the channel.
Trash racks are sized to handle expected flows and
protect downstream structures. Most trash rack de-
signs allow debris to ride up and to the side of the cage.
Trash racks generally perform better in smaller drain-
ages and need to be cleared after each storm to be
effective.
Storm Patrols—Patrols during storms provide im-
mediate response for assessment of flood risk, clearing
of blocked culvert entrances and drainage ditches, and
closing areas that are at risk for floods, landslides, and
so forth. This treatment can include early warning
systems, such as radio-activated rain gauges or stream
gauge alarms, that signal potential flooding conditions.
Ditch Cleaning and Ditch Armoring—Cleaning
and armoring provides adequate water flow capacity
and prevents downcutting of ditches. Without this
treatment, high water levels can overtop roadways
leading to gully development in roadbeds.
Armoring Ford Crossing—Armored crossings pro-
vide low-cost access across stream channels that are
generally capable of producing large flows that flood
the road surface. Large riprap is placed upstream and
downstream of actual road crossing areas. Armored
crossings are most often used for gravel roads.
Outsloping—Outsloping prevents concentration of
flow on road surfaces that produces rilling, gullying,
and rutting. This is one of the few rehabilitation
treatments that have both immediate and long-term
facility and resource benefits. Given that roads are a
major source of sediment in forests, road improve-
ments that reduce erosion from roads are beneficial.
Sometimes after regrading, compaction does not occur
due to low traffic volume, which may produce some
short-term erosion. Traffic should be curtailed during
wet road conditions to prevent rutting and road sub-
grade damages.
Trail Work—The purpose of rehabilitation treat-
ments on trails is to provide adequate drainage and
stability so trails do not contribute to concentrated
flows or become sources of sediment. This treatment is
labor intensive, as all the work must be done by hand
with materials that can be hand carried or brought in
on ATVs. Water bars need to be installed correctly at
proper slopes and depths to be effective.
Other Treatments—A variety of other minor treat-
ments are available as solutions to specific problems.
They include wetting agents to reduce water repel-
lency on high erosion hazard areas, gully plugs to
prevent headcutting in meadows, flood signing instal-
lation to warn residents and visitors of flooding poten-
tial, and removal of loose rocks above roadways that
were held in place by roots, forest debris, and duff
consumed by fire.
Road Treatment Effectiveness
Road treatments are designed to move water to
desired locations and prevent washout of roads. There
is little quantitative research evaluating and compar-
ing road treatment effectiveness. A recent computer
model, X-DRAIN, can provide sediment estimates for
various spacings of cross drains (Elliot and others
1998), and the computer model, WEPP-Road, provides
sedimentation estimates for various road configura-
tions and mitigation treatments (Elliot and others
1999). Thus, effectiveness of various spacings of roll-
ing dips, waterbars, cross drains, and culvert bypasses
can be compared.
BAER Expert Ratings—Only two road treat-
ments—culvert upgrading and trash racks—received
more than three effectiveness evaluations. The re-
sponses covered the range from “excellent” to “poor,”
although 73 percent of the BAER experts rated culvert
upgrading “excellent” or “good” in effectiveness (table
10.2). Evaluations of trash racks were evenly split as
“excellent,” “fair,” or “poor.”
Research and Monitoring Results—Furniss and
others (1998) developed an excellent analysis of fac-
tors contributing to road failures at culverted stream
crossings. These locations are important because 80 to
90 percent of fluvial hillslope erosion in wildlands can
be traced to road fill failures and diversions of road-
stream crossings that are unrelated to wildfires (Best
and others 1995). Because it is impossible to design
and build all stream crossings to withstand extreme
stormflows, they recommended increasing crossing
capacity and designing to minimize the consequences
of culvert exceedence as the best approaches for forest
road stream crossings.
Comprehensive discussions of road-related treat-
ments and their effectiveness can be found in Packer
and Christensen (1977), Goldman and others (1986),
and Burroughs and King (1989). Recently the USDA
Forest Service’s San Dimas Technology and Develop-
ment Program developed a Water/Road Interaction
Technologies Series (Copstead 1997) that covers de-
sign standards, improvement techniques, and evalu-
ates some surface drainage treatments for reducing
sedimentation.

Summary, Conclusions, and
Recommendations ______________
Spending on postfire emergency watershed rehabili-
tation has steadily increased since about 1990. An
evaluation of USDA Forest Service burned area emer-
gency rehabilitation treatment effectiveness was com-
pleted jointly by the USDA Forest Service Research
and Development and National Forest System staffs.
The resulting study by Robichaud and others (2000)
analyzed BAER treatment attributes and conditions
that led to success or failure in achieving BAER goals
after wildfires in the continental Western United
States. The study found that spending on rehabilita-
tion had risen sharply during the previous decade
because the perceived threat of debris flows and floods
had increased where fires were closer to the wildland-
urban interface. Existing literature on treatment ef-
fectiveness is limited, thus making treatment com-
parisons difficult; however, the amount of protection
provided by any treatment is limited—especially dur-
ing short-duration, high-intensity rainfall events.
Relatively little monitoring of postfire rehabilita-
tion treatments had been conducted between 1970 and
2000. During that time there were at least 321 fires
that received BAER treatment, which cost the Forest
Service around $110 million. Some level of monitoring
occurred on about 33 percent of the fires that received
BAER treatments. Since 2000, the number, size, and
severity of fires in the Western United States have
dramatically increased, with a concurrent increase in
BAER spending to about $80 million annually. How-
ever, monitoring efforts continue to be short-term and
inconsistent. Analysis of the literature, Burned Area
Report forms, interview comments, monitoring re-
ports, treatment effectiveness ratings, and the au-
thors’ continuing work in the area of postfire rehabili-
tation have led to the conclusions and recommendations
discussed in this section.
Recommendations: Models and
Predictions
•
Rainfall intensity as well as rainfall amount
and duration affect the success of rehabilita-
tion treatment. Rehabilitation treatments are
least ineffective in short-duration, high-inten-
sity rainstorms (that is, convective thunder-
storms), particularly in the first 2 years after
burning.
•
Quantitative data are needed to guide future
responses to postfire rehabilitation and to
build, test, and refine predictive models for
different burned forest environments. Accu-
rate climate, runoff, and erosion models for
burned forest environments is dependent on
(1) improved mapping of burn severity and
better characterization of postfire soil water
repellency, (2) improved prediction of runoff
responses at different spatial scales, includ-
ing short-duration high-intensity thunder-
storms, (3) quantitative data for the relative
magnitudes and consequences of hillslope
verses channel erosion, and (4) refined sedi-
ment deposition and routing models for vari-
ous drainages.
Recommendations: Postfire Rehabilitation
Treatment
•
Rehabilitation should be done only if the risk
to life and property is high since significant
resources have to be invested to ensure im-
provement over natural recovery. In most
watersheds, it is best not to do any treatments.
If treatments are necessary, then it is more
effective to detain runoff and reduce erosion
on site (hillslope treatment) than to collect it
downstream (channel treatment).
•
Seeding treatment may not be needed as often
as previously thought. Seeding has a low prob-
ability of reducing erosion the first wet season
after a fire when erosion rates are highest.
Thus, it is often necessary to do other treat-
ments in critical areas.
•
Mulching can be an effective treatment be-
cause it provides immediate protection from
raindrop impact and overland flow. Mulching
rates that provide at least 70 percent ground
cover are desirable in critical areas.
•
Contour-felled log structures have limited
benefit as an effective treatment compared to
other hillslope treatments if: (a) the density
and size of the felled logs are matched to the
expected erosion, (b) the logs, basins, and sills
are properly located, and (c) the treated area is
not likely to be subjected to short-duration
high-intensity storms. This is considered to be
true for areas where runoff and erosion rates
are expected to be high. These treatments
provide storm-by-storm protection during the
first year postfire where runoff and erosion
rates are highest. In areas that lack available
trees, straw wattles can provide an alterna-
tive. However, the overall effectiveness of prop-
erly designed and constructed contour-felled
logs and straw wattles needs adequate study
and documentation in the scientific literature.
•
Channel treatments, such as straw bale
check-dams, should be viewed as secondary
mitigation treatments. Sediment has already
been transported from the hillslopes and

USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
197
will eventually be released though the stream
system unless it is physically removed from
the channel. Most channel treatments hold
sediment temporarily so that the release is
desynchronized from the storm flow event.
•
To reduce the threat of road failure, road
treatments such as rolling dips, water bars,
and relief culverts, properly spaced, provide a
reasonable method to move water past the
road prism. Storm patrol attempts to keep
culverts clear and close areas as needed. This
approach shows promise as a cost effective
technique to reduce road failure due to culvert
blockage.
•
The development and launch of the Web-based
database of past and current BAER projects
should be expedited so that future decisions
are based on the best data available. This
database will include treatment design crite-
ria and specifications, contract implementa-
tion specifications, example Burned Area Re-
port calculations, and monitoring techniques.
This database needs to be kept current as new
information is obtained.
Recommendations: Effectiveness
monitoring
•
The need for improved effectiveness monitor-
ing has gained momentum. In April 2003, the
Government Accounting Office published a
report entitled Wildland Fires: Better Infor-
mation Needed on Effectiveness of Emergency
Stabilization and Rehabilitation Treatments,
which clearly stated that neither the USDA
Forest Service nor the Department of the
Interior’s Bureau of Land Management could
determine whether emergency stabilization
and rehabilitation treatments were achieving
their intended results. Although treatment
monitoring is required, there is no agreed-on
protocol for how and what to collect and ana-
lyze for determining effectiveness. Such proto-
col needs to be pursued.
•
Effectiveness monitoring needs to be initiated
as quickly as possible after treatments are
applied, as the first storms typically pose the
greatest risk to downstream resources. Effec-
tiveness monitoring should include quantify-
ing reductions in erosion, sedimentation, and/
or downstream flooding. It may also include
measurement of changes in infiltration, soil
productivity, ecosystem recovery, and water
quality parameters. Burned but untreated
areas must be available to provide a control, or
baseline, from which to assess both short- and
long-term effectiveness of treatments as well
as ecosystem response to the fire and natural
recovery rates. Recently published techniques
are now available that may aid in the develop-
ment of monitoring protocols (Robichaud and
Brown 2002).
•
Funding for effectiveness monitoring must be
part of the BAER treatment funding request
and extend for at least 5 years after the fire.
This necessitates a change in BAER funding
protocol, which currently is limited to 2 years.
•
Policy and funding mechanisms should be
established to take advantage of the overlap
between research and monitoring by support-
ing activities that can accomplish the goals of
both programs. This should include testing of
new rehabilitation technologies as they be-
come available.

Introduction ____________________
New research and development result in continually
improved information on the effects of fire on soils and
water. Nevertheless, as the wildfire seasons of the
recent past point out, there is need for additional work
in this area. Also, expansion of populations in the
Western United States have placed greater demands
on forested watersheds to provide stable supplies of
water for municipalities. And more physical resources
are now at risk from postfire streamflow events.
This volume updates the information available on
impacts of fire on soils and water, to a given point in

time. Barring more frequent updates of this volume
(originally published in 1979; Wells and others 1979,
Tiedemann and others 1979), future information re-
trieval must be dynamic and current.
This chapter outlines additional sources of informa-
tion, particularly those that are likely to be easily
updated and accessible. We have attempted to identify
some of the more common places where fire personnel
may search for general and specific fire effects and
associated fire environment information. Examples
shown are meant to be illustrative and not inclusive of
all sources.

Volume Objective _______________
The objective of this volume is to provide an over-
view of the state-of-the-art understanding of the ef-
fects of fire on soils and water in wildland ecosystems.
Our challenge was to provide a meaningful summary
for North American fire effects on these resources
despite enormous variations produced by climate,
topography, fuel loadings, and fire regimes. This vol-
ume is meant to be an information guide to assist land
managers with fire management planning and public
education, and a reference on fire effects processes,
pertinent publications, and other information sources.
Although it contains far more information and de-
tailed site-specific effects of fire on soils and water
than the original 1979 Rainbow volumes, it is not
designed to be a comprehensive research-level trea-
tise or compendium. That challenge is left to several
textbooks (Chandler and others 1991, Agee 1993, Pyne
and others 1996, DeBano and others 1998).

Chapter 12:
Summary and
Research Needs
Soil Physical Properties
Summary ______________________
The physical processes occurring during fires are
complex and include both heat transfer and the asso-
ciated change in soil physical characteristics. The
most important soil physical characteristic affected by
fire is soil structure because the organic matter com-
ponent can be lost at relatively low temperatures. The
loss of soil structure increases the bulk density of the
soil and reduces its porosity, thereby reducing soil
productivity and making the soil more vulnerable to
postfire runoff and erosion. Although heat is trans-
ferred in the soil by several mechanisms, its move-
ment by vaporization and condensation is the most
important. The result of heat transfer in the soil is an
increase in soil temperature that affects the physical,
chemical, and biological properties of the soil. When
organic substances are moved downward in the soil by
vaporization and condensation, they can cause a wa-
ter-repellent soil condition that further accentuates

208
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
postfire runoff and extensive networks of surface rill
erosion or erosion by raindrop splash. The magnitude
of change in soil physical properties depends on the
temperature threshold of the soil properties and the
severity of the fire. The greatest change in soil physical
properties occurs when smoldering fires burn for long
periods.
Soil Chemistry Summary _________
The most basic soil chemical property affected by
soil heating during fires is organic matter. Organic
matter not only plays a key role in the chemistry of the
soil, but it also affects the physical properties (see
chapter 2) and the biological properties (see chapter 4)
of soils as well. Soil organic matter plays a key role in
nutrient cycling, cation exchange, and water retention
in soils. When organic matter is combusted, the stored
nutrients are either volatilized or are changed into
highly available forms that can be taken up readily by
microbial organisms and vegetation. Those available
nutrients not immobilized are easily lost by leaching
or surface runoff and erosion. Nitrogen is the most
important nutrient affected by fire, and it is easily
volatilized and lost from the site at relatively low
temperatures. The amount of change in organic mat-
ter and nitrogen is directly related to the magnitude of
soil heating and the severity of the fire. High- and
moderate-severity fires cause the greatest losses. Ni-
trogen loss by volatilization during fires is of particu-
lar concern on low-fertility sites because N can only be
replaced by N-fixing organisms. Cations are not easily
volatilized and usually remain on the site in a highly
available form. An abundance of cations can be found
in the thick ash layers (or ash-bed) remaining on the
soil surface following high-severity fires.
Soil Biology Summary ___________
Soil microorganisms are complex. Community mem-
bers range in activity from those merely trying to
survive, to others responsible for biochemical reac-
tions that are among the most elegant and intricate
known. How they respond to fire will depend on nu-
merous factors, including fire intensity and severity,
site characteristics, and preburn community composi-
tion. Some generalities can be made, however. First,
most studies have shown strong resilience by micro-
bial communities to fire. Recolonization to preburn
levels is common, with the amount of time required for
recovery generally varying in proportion to fire sever-
ity. Second, the effect of fire is greatest in the forest
floor (litter and duff). Prescriptions that consume
major fuels but protect forest floor, humus layers, and
soil humus are recommended.
Fire and Streamflow Regimes
Summary ______________________
Fires affect water cycle processes to a greater or
lesser extent depending on severity. Fires can produce
some substantial effects on the streamflow regime of
both small streams and rivers, affecting annual and
seasonal water yield, peakflows and floods, baseflows,
and timing of flows. Adequate baseflows are necessary
to support the continued existence of many wildlife
populations. Water yields are important because many
forest, scrubland, and grassland watersheds function
as municipal water supplies. Peakflows and floods are
of great concern because of their potential impacts on
human safety and property. Next to the physical
destruction of a fire itself, postfire floods are the most
damaging aspect of fire in the wildland environment.
It is important that resource specialists and managers
become aware of the potential of fires to increase
peakflows.
Following wildfires, flood peakflows can increase
dramatically, severely affecting stream physical con-
ditions, aquatic habitat, aquatic biota, cultural re-
sources, and human health and safety. Often, in-
creased flood peakflows of up to 100 times those
previously recorded, well beyond observed ranges of
variability in managed watersheds, have been mea-
sured after wildfires. Potentials exist for peak flood
flows to jump to 2,300 times prewildfire levels. Manag-
ers must be aware of these potential watershed re-
sponses in order to adequately and safely manage
their lands and other resources in the postwildfire
environment.
Water Quality Summary __________
When a wildland fire occurs, the principal concerns
for change in water quality are: (1) the introduction of
sediment; (2) the potential for increasing nitrates,
especially if the foliage being burned is in an area of
chronic atmospheric deposition; (3) the possible intro-
duction of heavy metals from soils and geologic sources
within the burned area; and (4) the introduction of fire
retardant chemicals into streams that can reach levels
toxic to aquatic organisms.
The magnitude of the effects of fire on water quality
is primarily driven by fire severity, and not necessarily
by fire intensity. Fire severity is a qualitative term
describing the amount of fuel consumed, while fire
intensity is a quantitative measure of the rate of heat
release (see chapter 1). In other words, the more severe
the fire the greater the amount of fuel consumed and
nutrients released and the more susceptible the site is
to erosion of soil and nutrients into the stream where
it could potentially affect water quality. Wildfires
usually are more severe than prescribed fires. As a

USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
209
result, they are more likely to produce significant
effects on water quality. On the other hand, prescribed
fires are designed to be less severe and would be
expected to produce less effect on water quality. Use of
prescribed fire allows the manager the opportunity to
control the severity of the fire and to avoid creating
large areas burned at high severity.
The degree of fire severity is also related to the
vegetation type. For example, in grasslands the differ-
ences between prescribed fire and wildfire are prob-
ably small. In forested environments, the magnitude
of the effects of fire on water quality will probably be
much lower after a prescribed fire than after a wildfire
because of the larger amount of fuel consumed in a
wildfire. Canopy-consuming wildfires would be ex-
pected to be of the most concern to managers because
of the loss of canopy coupled with the destruction of soil
aggregates. These losses present the worst-case sce-
nario in terms of water quality. The differences be-
tween wild and prescribed fire in shrublands are
probably intermediate between those seen in grass
and forest environments.
Another important determinant of the magnitude of
the effects of fire on water quality is slope. Steepness
of the slope has a significant influence on movement of
soil and nutrients into stream channels where it can
affect water quality. Wright and others (1976) found
that as slope increased in a prescribed fire, erosion
from slopes is accelerated. If at all possible, the vegeta-
tive canopy on steep, erodible slopes needs to be
maintained, particularly if adequate streamside
buffer strips do not exist to trap the large amounts of
sediment and nutrients that can be transported
quickly into the stream channel. It is important to
maintain streamside buffer strips whenever possible,
especially when developing prescribed fire plans. These
buffer strips will capture much of the sediment and
nutrients from burned upslope areas.
Nitrogen is of concern to water quality. If soils on a
particular site are close to N saturation, it is possible
to exceed maximum contamination levels of NO3-N
(10 ppm or 10 mg/L) after a severe fire. Such areas
should not have N-containing fertilizer applied after
the fire. Chapter 3 contains more discussion of N. Fire
retardants typically contain large amounts of N, and
they can cause water quality problems where drops
are made close to streams.
The propensity for a site to develop water repel-
lency after fire must be considered (see chapter 2).
Water-repellent soils do not allow precipitation to
penetrate down into the soil and therefore are condu-
cive to erosion. Severe fires on such sites can put
large amounts of sediment and nutrients into surface
water.
Finally, heavy rain on recently burned land can
seriously degrade water quality. Severe erosion and
runoff are not limited to wildfire sites alone. But if
postfire storms deliver large amounts of precipitation
or short-duration, high-intensity rainfalls, acceler-
ated erosion and runoff can occur even after a carefully
planned prescribed fire. Conversely, if below-average
precipitation occurs after a wildfire, there may not be
a substantial increase in erosion and runoff and no
effect on water quality.
Fire managers can influence the effects of fire on
water quality by careful planning before prescribed
burning. Limiting fire severity, avoiding burning on
steep slopes, and limiting burning on potentially wa-
ter-repellent soils will reduce the magnitude of the
effects of fire on water quality.
Aquatic Biota Summary __________
The effects of wildland fire on fish are mostly indi-
rect in nature. There are some documented instances
of fires killing fish directly. The largest problems arise
from the longer term impact on habitat. This includes
changes in stream temperature due to plant under-
story and overstory removal, ash-laden slurry flows,
increases in flood peakflows, and sedimentation due to
increased landscape erosion. Most information on the
effects of wildfire on fishes has been generated since
about 1990. Limited observational information exists
on the immediate, direct effect of fire on fishes. Most
information is indirect and demonstrates the effects of
ash flows, changes in hydrologic regimes, and in-
creases in suspended sediment on fishes. These im-
pacts are marked, ranging from 70 percent to total loss
of fishes. The effects of fire retardants on fishes are
observational and not well documented at present.
Further, all information is from forested biomes as
opposed to grasslands.
Anthropogenic influences, largely land use activi-
ties over the past century, cumulatively influence fire
effects on fishes. Fire suppression alone has affected
vegetation densities on the landscape and the severity
and extent of wildfire and, in turn, its effects on
aquatic ecosystems and fishes. Most all studies of fire
effects on fishes are short term (less than 5 years) and
local in nature. A landscape approach to analyses has
not been made to date. Fish can recover rapidly from
population reductions or loss but can be markedly
limited or precluded by loss of stream connectivity
imposed by human-induced barriers. Fisheries man-
agement postfire should be based on species and fish-
eries and their management status. Managers should
be vigilant of opportunities to restore native fishes in
event of removal of introduced, nonnative, translo-
cated species.
Although the impact of fire on fishes appears to be
marked, a larger impact may loom in the future. Recent
advances in atmospheric, marine, and terrestrial

210
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
ecosystem science have resulted in the correlation of
ocean temperature oscillations, tree ring data, and
drought. Based on current information on fire effects on
fishes, combined with that of climate change, drought,
and recent insect infestations, the greatest impacts on
fish may lie ahead. The information emerging in new
climate change analyses suggests that the Southeast-
ern and parts of the Western United States have a high
probability of continuing and future drought, with
potential impact of wildfire on fishes in the Southwest.
Based on some of these overarching global indicators,
the rest of the story is starting to unfold.
The effects of fires on reptile and amphibian popula-
tions are also covered in volume 1 of this series (Smith
2000). A review by Russell and others (1999) con-
cluded that there are few reports of fire-caused injury
to herpetofauna in general much less aquatic and
wetland species.
Similar to fishes, the recorded effects of fire on
aquatic macroinvertebrates are indirect as opposed to
direct. Response varies from minimal to no changes in
abundance, diversity, or richness, to considerable and
significant changes. Abundance of macroinvertebrates
may actually increase in fire-affected streams, but
diversity generally is reduced. These differences are
undoubtedly related to landscape variability, burn
size and severity, stream size, nature and timing of
postfire flooding events, and postfire time. Tempo-
rally, changes in macroinvertebrate indices in the first
5 years postfire can be different from ensuing years,
and long-term (10 to 30 years) effects have been
suggested.
The effects of fires on bird populations are covered in
volume 1 of this series (Smith 2000). Aquatic areas
and wetlands often provide refugia during fires.
However, wetlands such as cienegas, marshes, cy-
press swamps, spruce, and larch swamps do burn
under the right conditions. The impacts of fires on
individual birds and populations in wetlands would
then depend upon the season, uniformity, and severity
of burning (Smith 2000).
Aquatic and wetland dwelling mammals are usually
not adversely impacted by fires due to animal mobility
and the lower frequency of fires in these areas. Lyon
and others (2000) discuss factors such as fire unifor-
mity, size, duration, and severity that affect mam-
mals. However, most of their discussion relates to
terrestrial mammals, not aquatic and wetland ones.
Aquatic and wetland habitats also provide safety zones
for mammals during fires.
Wetlands Summary ______________
While the connection between wetlands and fire
appears incongruous, fire plays an integral role in
the creation and persistence of wetland species and
ecosystems. Wetland systems have come under
various classification systems, reflecting both the
current understanding of wetland processes and the
missions of the individual land management agencies.
We examined some of the complex water inflows and
outflows that are balanced by the interrelationships
between biotic and abiotic factors. The presence and
movement of water are dominant factors control-
ling the interactions of fire with wetland dynamics,
nutrient and energy flow, soil chemistry, organic
matter decomposition, and plant and animal com-
munity composition.
In wetland soils, the effects produced by surface and
ground fires are related to the intensity and duration
of fire at either the soil surface or the interface be-
tween burning and nonburning organic soil materials.
In general, surface fires can be characterized as short
duration, variable severity ones, while ground fires
can be characterized as having longer duration and
lower severity. However, the latter type of fires can
produce profound physical and chemical changes in
wetlands.
Models Summary _______________
A number of older modeling technologies are com-
monly used in estimating fire effects during and after
fire (FOFEM, WATSED, WEPP, RUSLE, and others).
Newer models include DELTA-Q and FOREST, and
others are under construction. These process-based
models provide managers with additional tools to
estimate the magnitude of fire effects on soil and water
produced by land disturbance. FOFEM was developed
to meet the needs of resource managers, planners, and
analysts in predicting and planning for fire effects.
Quantitative predictions of fire effects are needed for
planning prescribed fires that best accomplish re-
source needs, for impact assessment, and for long-
range planning and policy development. FOFEM was
developed to meet this information need. The WATSED
technology was developed for watershed analysis. The
RUSLE model was developed for agriculture and range-
land hillslopes and has been extended to forest lands.
The WEPP model was designed as an improvement
over RUSLE that can either be run as a stand-alone
computer model by specialists, or accessed through a
special Internet interface designed for forest applica-
tions, including wild fires.
All of these models have limitations that must be
understood by fire managers or watershed specialists
before they are applied. The models are only as good as
the data used to create and validate them. Some
processes such as extreme flow and erosion events are
not simulated very well because of the lack of good
data or the complexity of the processes. However, they
do provide useful tools to estimate landscape changes

USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
211
to disturbances such as fire. Potential users should
make use of the extensive documentation of these
models and consult with the developers to ensure the
most appropriate usage of the models.
Watershed Rehabilitation
Summary ______________________
Spending on postfire emergency watershed rehabili-
tation has steadily increased since 1990. An evalua-
tion of USDA Forest Service burned area emergency
rehabilitation treatment effectiveness was completed
jointly by the USDA Forest Service Research and
Development and National Forest System staffs.
Robichaud and others (2000) collected and analyzed
information on past use of BAER treatments in order
to determine attributes and conditions that led to
treatment success or failure in achieving BAER goals
after wildfires in the continental Western United
States. The study found that spending on rehabilita-
tion has risen sharply recently because the perceived
threat of debris flows and floods has increased where
fires are closer to the wildland-urban interface. Exist-
ing literature on treatment effectiveness is limited,
thus making treatment comparisons difficult; how-
ever, the amount of protection provided by any treat-
ment is limited—especially during short-duration,
high-intensity rainfall events.
Relatively little monitoring of postfire rehabilita-
tion treatments has been conducted in the last three
decades. In the three decades prior to 2000, there were
at least 321 fires that received BAER treatment,
which cost the Forest Service around $110 million.
Some level of monitoring occurred on about 33 percent
of these project fires. In the early 2000s, the number,
size, and severity of Western United States fires dra-
matically increased, with a concurrent increase in
BAER spending of about $50 million annually. Moni-
toring efforts continue to be short term and inconsis-
tent. Analysis of the literature, Burned Area Report
forms, interview comments, monitoring reports, treat-
ment effectiveness ratings, and the authors’ continu-
ing work in the area of postfire rehabilitation have led
to the conclusions and recommendations.
Information Sources
Summary ______________________
This volume updates the information available on
fire’s impacts on soils and water. It is just one source
of information prepared to a given point in time.
Barring more frequent updates of this volume (origi-
nally published in 1979; Wells and others 1979,
Tiedemann and others 1979), some mechanisms for
future information retrieval need to be continually
dynamic and current. The World Wide Web has
produced a quantum leap in the availability of infor-
mation now at the fire manager’s finger tips, with
past and current information on the Web growing
daily. The future problem will be synthesizing the
mountains of information now available. It is hoped
that this volume provides some of that synthesis.
Research Needs ________________
This volume points out information gaps and re-
search needs throughout its chapters. To complicate
matters more, some regions of the country are experi-
encing larger and more severe fires that are producing
ecosystem effects not studied before. Some of the key
research needs are:
•
 Beyond the initial vegetation and watershed
condition impacts of the physical process of
fire, suppression activities can add further
levels of disturbance to both soils and water.
These disturbances need to be evaluated along
with those produced by fire.
•
The burning of concentrated fuels (such as
slash, large woody debris) can cause substan-
tial damage to the soil resource even though
these long-term effects are limited to only a
small proportion of the landscape where the
fuels are piled. The physical, chemical, and
biological effects of concentrated fuel burning
need to be better understood.
•
Improved understanding of the effects of fire
on soil chemical properties is needed for man-
aging fire on all ecosystems, and particularly
in fire-dependent systems.
•
Soil microorganisms are complex. Community
members range in activity from those merely
trying to survive to others responsible for
biochemical reactions among the most elegant
and intricate known. How they respond to fire
will depend on numerous factors, including
fire intensity and severity, site characteris-
tics, and preburn community composition.
Understanding of these responses is needed.
•
Peakflows and floods are of great concern
because of their potential impacts on human
safety and property. Next to the physical de-
struction of a fire itself, postfire floods are the
most damaging aspect of fire in the wildland
environment. It is important that research
focus on improving the ability of resource
specialists and managers to understand the
potential of fires to increase peakflows and to
improve predictions of floods.
•
Heavy rain on recently burned land can seri-
ously degrade water quality. Severe erosion

212
USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 4. 2005
and runoff are not limited to wildfire sites
alone. But if postfire storms deliver large
amounts of precipitation or short-duration,
high-intensity rainfalls, accelerated erosion
and runoff can occur even after a carefully
planned prescribed fire. The effects of fire on
municipal watersheds are not well documented,
and the ability to predict magnitude and dura-
tion of water quality change is limited.
•
Limited observational information exists on
the immediate, direct effect of fire on fishes.
Most information is indirect and demonstrates
the effects of ash flows, changes in hydrologic
regimes, and increases in suspended sediment
on fishes. These impacts are marked, ranging
from 70 percent to total loss of fishes. Also, the
effects of fire retardants on fishes is observa-
tional and not well documented. Further, most
information is from forested biomes, so re-
search needs to be expanded to grasslands.
•
Anthropogenic influences, largely land use
activities over the past century, cumulatively
influence fire effects on fishes. Fire suppres-
sion alone has affected vegetation densities on
the landscape and the severity and extent of
wildfire and, in turn, its effects on aquatic
ecosystems and fishes. Most all studies of
fire effects on fishes are short term (less
than 5 years) and local in nature. A landscape
approach to analyses and research needs to be
made.
•
Riparian areas are particularly important
because they provide buffer strips that trap
sediment and nutrients that are released when
surrounding watersheds are burned. The width
of these buffer strips is critical for minimizing
sediment and nutrient movement into the
streams. But little information exists on effec-
tive buffer strips and sizes.
•
Although we have several models, all of them
have limitations that must be understood by
fire managers or watershed specialists before
they are applied. The models are only as good
as the data used to create and validate them.
Some processes such as extreme flow and
erosion events are not simulated well because
of the lack of good data or the complexity of the
processes.
•
The need for improved effectiveness monitor-
ing has gained momentum. In April 2003, the
Government Accounting Office of Congress
published a report (GAO 2003) that clearly
stated that neither the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s Forest Service nor the Depart-
ment of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Manage-
ment could determine whether emergency sta-
bilization and rehabilitation treatments were
achieving their intended results. Although
treatment monitoring is required, there is no
agreed-on protocol for how and what to collect
and analyze for determining effectiveness.
•
Rainfall intensity as well as rainfall amount
and duration affect the success of rehabilita-
tion treatment. Rehabilitation treatments are
least effective in short-duration, high-inten-
sity rainstorms (that is, convective thunder-
storms), particularly in the first 2 years after
burning. Information is limited in this area.
•
Quantitative data are needed to guide future
responses to postfire rehabilitation and to
build, test, and refine predictive models for
different burned forest environments. Accu-
rate climate, runoff, and erosion models for
burned forest environments are dependent
on (1) improved mapping of burn severity and
better characterization of postfire soil water
repellency; (2) improved prediction of runoff
responses at different spatial scales, includ-
ing short-duration, high-intensity thunder-
storms; (3) quantitative data for the relative
magnitudes and consequences of hillslope
verses channel erosion; and (4) refined sedi-
ment deposition and routing models for vari-
ous drainages.
•
Consumption of organic soil horizons has only
been quantified in a limited number of vegeta-
tion types. Although moisture vs. consump-
tion patterns have emerged there is still a
need to quantify consumptin and soil heating
in a wider range of vegetation types. Likewise
additional research is needed to further eluci-
date the physical mechanisms of organic soil
consumption such that robust models based
on combustion and heat transfer relationships
can eventually replace the empirical studies
leading to wider application.
•
Salvage logging after wildfires is becoming a
more common occurrence. Research in the
past has examined the soil and water impacts
of logging and wildfire separately, but rarely
together. There is a large need for logging and
its associated roading activities at various
time intervals post-wildfire, and for different
forest ecosystems and physiographic regions.
