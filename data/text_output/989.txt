Abstract
Matching the right feedstock quality to a biomass conversion technology effectively facilitates the energy conversion
process and improves the economic feasibility of forest biomass for energy production. In this study, we conducted a
controlled experiment on a horizontal grinder to evaluate the effect of three different grate size combinations on grinding
productivity, fuel consumption, and particle size distribution for two different biomass types (mixed conifer slash and
hardwood whole trees). Mixed conifer slash resulted in higher grinding productivity (39.0 to 45.1 bone dry US tons/h) and a
lower fuel consumption rate (0.57 to 0.90 gal/h) than hardwood whole trees. Small grate size conﬁgurations (2-, 3-, and 3-in.
holes) in the grinder had low grinding productivity and higher fuel consumption rates compared with large grate size
conﬁgurations (3-, 4-, and 4-in. holes). High grinding productivity and low fuel consumption rates were accomplished by
using a new anvil type that is manufactured with holes in the plate. The study also showed that production of small feedstock
particles (length, ,2 in.) from logging slash was operationally feasible by using small grates and a newly designed anvil.
Additional research is needed to further control oversized materials and improve our knowledge about the effect of moisture
content on grinding productivity, especially with a wide range of grate size combinations.
Biomass derived from forests can come from materials
removed in mechanical thinning and as residues from
conventional sawtimber harvesting operations. They pro-
duce a wide variety of feedstock types (unmerchantable
trees, small-diameter trees, tops, limbs, and chunks) with
varying moisture contents (25% to 60%). These materials
are highly variable in shape and size and are characterized
as loose, low-density materials. In-woods chipping or
grinding, referred to as ‘‘comminution,’’ is used to process
these materials into uniformly sized biomass feedstocks for
energy production. The comminution process also facilitates
efﬁcient transportation, which is one of the most expensive
components in a biomass feedstock supply chain (Han and
Murphy 2012). These factors may inﬂuence the quality of
the feedstock and the productivity of different comminution
processes.
The primary machinery used for biomass comminution
are chippers (disc and drum) and grinders (horizontal and
tub). Each machine type has its advantages and disadvan-
tages. Chippers are better designed to process larger-
diameter materials, such as whole trees, large limbs, and
chunks, by cutting woody material with a slicing action and
producing relatively uniform chips (Assirelli et al. 2013).
Unlike chippers, grinders reduce the size of woody biomass
particles by repeatedly pounding them into smaller pieces
through a combination of tensile, shear, and compressive
forces. They will accept a wider range of grinding material
types, including whole trees, stumps, tops, brush, and large
forked branches. In addition, grinders are not as sensitive to
contamination, but bit and grate life may improve with clean
material. The ‘‘hog fuel’’ produced from biomass is highly
variable in size.
Emerging biomass conversion technologies, such as
gasiﬁcation, pelletization, and torrefaction, aim to reduce
the cost of transportation by further densifying the material.
However, hog fuel is not commonly used in these biomass

conversion technologies. One challenge is meeting the
desired material speciﬁcations for each technology. The
important feedstock speciﬁcations for biomass conversion
systems are particle size distribution, moisture content, tree
species, contamination level, and ash content. Particle size
distribution is one of the most important issues in forest
biomass energy because it especially affects transportation
costs and combustion efﬁciency at the end-use location. It
also affects energy value and durability during storage in the
bioreﬁnery (Nati et al. 2010). In addition, particle size
affects the energy requirement of the hydrothermal
pretreatment needed for the conversion of woody biomass
into liquid biofuels (Hosseini and Shah 2009). Larger
particles also have greater combustion time than smaller
particles, which reduces the net utilization of the fuel. For
energy production, the optimal particle size of biomass
feedstocks depends upon the type of burners used and the
biomass conversion system. In Canada, a particle size of
less than 1 inch is required for small boilers (,1 MW),
while a particle size of less than 2 inches is suitable for large
boilers (.1 MW; Naimi et al. 2006). In the US Paciﬁc
Northwest, most biomass energy plants generally require
their fuels to have a particle size of 3 inches or smaller. In
addition, several fast pyrolysis biofuel facilities simply
specify that the ideal feedstock should be 2 inches or less
because long particles can clog auger mechanisms feeding
the conversion reactor (Wechsler et al. 2010).
Particle size distribution in the grinding process is
inﬂuenced by a number of factors, such as machine type,
raw material, moisture content, knife/bit setting, and grate/
screen sizes used. Chippers usually produce highly uniform
particle sizes compared with grinders. For whole trees and
treetops, chippers are often used to produce uniform sizes.
Grinders are generally used to process forest residues, such
as limbs and chunks, into hog fuel, which is typically
characterized by having material in a wide range of sizes.
Grinders are also capable of handling material with a higher
amount of contamination in the form of soil aggregates.
Another factor that directly affects particle size distribu-
tion during the comminution process is moisture content of
biomass feedstocks. Suadicani and Gamborg (1999) exam-
ined the size distribution of chips from freshly felled and
summer-dried trees in western Denmark. They found that
summer-dried trees produced less ﬁne (1/8-in.) fractions and
a more homogeneous size distribution of chips than freshly
felled trees. However, more coarse (oversize) chips were
produced from summer-dried trees compared with chips
from freshly felled trees.
Feedstock species (hardwood or conifer) and types
(limbs, tops, stems, etc.) also have an inﬂuence on the
particle size distribution of fuel. Many hardwoods, such as
oak (Quercus spp.), beech (Fagus spp.), ash (Fraxinus spp.),
and sycamore (Platanus spp.), have stiff branches that
produce long particles, and small birch trees have pliable
branches that give many thin, overlong particles (Kofman
2006). Nati et al. (2010) investigated the effect of different
tree species (poplar vs. pine) and tree parts (branch vs. log)
on chipping productivity and particle size distribution. They
found that poplar chips tend to be larger than pine chips and
contain a higher proportion of oversized particles. Chips
produced from logs contained a smaller proportion of
oversized particles and a higher proportion of acceptable-
size particles.
The different equipment options, such as knives, bits,
anvils, and screen sizes, can also have a signiﬁcant impact
on particle size distribution, machine productivity, and fuel
consumption rates. Chippers generally require clean (little
contamination with soil aggregates) wood to get a
satisfactory knife life. Dull or damaged knives in chippers
usually result in increased and inconsistent particle sizes.
Additionally, knife wear after chipping 215 green tons of
wood caused a signiﬁcant reduction in chipping productivity
of up to 15 percent—and a remarkable increase of fuel
consumption of up to 60 percent—compared with when new
knives were used (Nati et al. 2010). Smaller screen sizes
tend to reduce the particle size of chipped or ground
materials compared with larger screen sizes, but the
installation of smaller screen sizes causes a signiﬁcant
reduction of machine productivity and increase of fuel
consumption.
Each biomass conversion technology requires certain
material speciﬁcations to produce high-quality and sustain-
able bioenergy and useful biobased products from forest
residues. However, literature on how to achieve speciﬁc
feedstock particle sizes for different forest biomass
conversion systems is limited. Therefore, the aim of this
study was to investigate the effect of three different grate
size combinations on grinding productivity, fuel consump-
tion, and particle size distribution for two different biomass
types (mixed conifer slash and hardwood whole trees).
Materials and Methods
Field studies were conducted in June and September of
2012 on private industrial timberland in northern California.
A track-mounted horizontal grinder (Peterson Paciﬁc
5710C) was used to comminute forest residues, including
limbs, chunks, tops, and small-diameter trees of mixed
conifer and whole-tree hardwoods. The grinder was
powered by a Caterpillar C13 engine with 1,050 horsepower
and a drum rotor (diameter, 32 in.; width, 59ł in.; 20 sets of
bits) designed for land clearing, logging slash, and scrap
board. The grinder was ﬁtted with a solid anvil, one grate
with 3-inch holes, and two grates with 4-inch holes, to
produce hog fuel for local power plants. The loader
(Linkbelt 3400) used to feed the grinder had a rotating,
seven-tine grapple that placed material onto the grinder’s
horizontal infeed conveyer. After processing, the hog fuel
was fed via conveyor into a positioned chip trailer.
Grinding operations were carried out on two different
feedstock types: mixed conifer slash and hardwood whole
trees (Fig. 1; Table 1). Two different material ages (2 mo
and 1 y) were included for each feedstock type. Mixed
conifer slash was collected from two different clearcut
harvest units. The stand composition of both units ranged
from 51 to 61 percent redwood (Sequoia sempervirens (D.
Don.) Endl.), 18 to 30 percent Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga
menziesii Mirb.), 1 to 7 percent western hemlock (Tsuga
heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.), and 7 to 13 percent tanoak
(Lithocarpus densiﬂorus (Hook. & Arn.) Rehd.). Two
additional units were selected for testing hardwood whole
trees. These consisted of tanoak (46% to 68%), Douglas-ﬁr
(26% to 34%), redwood (8% to 13%), and western hemlock
(3% to 5%). For each feedstock type, the 1-year-old
materials were felled in May 2011 and used for our grinding
study in June 2012. The 2-month-old materials were
harvested in July 2012 and comminuted using the same
grinder in September 2012. The raw material composition
210

used in this study varied with feedstock type and date (i.e.,
age) of sawtimber harvest (Table 1). Moisture content was
also different at grinding operation times. Freshly felled
trees generally have higher moisture content than trees that
are felled and left for 1 year or for summer drying
(Suadicani and Gamborg 1999). In our study, however,
the 1-year-old mixed confer slash had higher moisture
content than the 2-month-old slash because the former
received signiﬁcant rain over the winter and held the
moisture in the pile of slash while the latter was felled and
left on the ground for 2 months in dry summer conditions
(Table 1).
In this study, four different types of feedstock (2-mo-old
and 1-y-old materials of conifer slash and hardwood whole
trees) were comminuted separately using the same grinder
with the same operators. For each feedstock type, three
different treatments were applied with three different grate
size combinations: solid anvil with 3-, 4-, and 4-inch grates
(SA-3-4-4); solid anvil with 2-, 3-, and 3-inch grates (SA-
2-3-3); and holed anvil with 3-, 4-, and 4-inch grates (HA-
3-4-4; Fig. 2). Five replications (;125 bone dry US tons
[BDT] in total) were applied for each treatment. Each
replication represents a van load (;25 BDT) of comminuted
materials. In each replication, a time-motion study was
conducted to measure the grinding time that corresponded to
the time required to ﬁll up a standard chip van with a
maximum payload capacity of 25 BDT. Load weights were
taken from scale tickets recorded at a local power plant.
Average fuel consumption rates for each treatment were
calculated using fuel level differences between the start of
the ﬁrst replication and end of the ﬁfth replication.
Samples of hog fuel were taken to determine particle size
distribution and moisture content. From each truck load,
three subsamples (;2.2 lb) were collected from the top of
the front, middle, and rear of a ﬁlled chip van container. All
three subsamples were mixed, weighed, and sealed in a
plastic bag. The bags were tagged to identify the slash type
and the treatment applied to each sample. In the laboratory,
the samples were placed in brown paper bags and allowed to
dry in a dry oven at 2218F for 24 hours and then reweighed.
Moisture content was determined using a wet-based method.
Each dried sample of hogfuel was screened roughly by
length using a BM&M Chip Classiﬁer with six screen trays
(2-, 1-, 1/2-, 3/8-, 1/4-, and 1/8-in. holes) and a ﬁnes tray to

obtain ﬁve size classes (,0.5, 0.5 to 1.0, 1.1 to 2.0, 2.1 to
3.0, and .3.0 in.). Each size class for every sample was
hand-sorted using digital calipers to measure the longest
dimension of the particle. The ﬁve classes of the sorted hog
fuel were then weighed separately. In the size distribution
analysis, the particle size of each class was weighed and
expressed as a percentage of the total mass of all ﬁve classes
combined.
Data analysis was performed using Statistical Analysis
System (SAS Institute Inc. 2001) and Statistical Package for
the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc. 1998). Data were evaluated
for normality before running the analysis. The effect of
feedstock types on grinding productivity was tested using a
one-way analysis of variance. Regression analysis was
conducted to ﬁnd the effects of feedstock type, age, and
grinder grate size on particle size distribution (Olsen et al.
1998). The signiﬁcance level was set to 5 percent (a¼0.05).
Results and Discussion
Grinding productivity
Grinding productivity was signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by
feedstock type (mixed conifer slash or hardwood whole tree)
and by grinder grate size (P , 0.001; Table 2). The effect of
feedstock age (freshness), however, had little statistical
signiﬁcance (P . 0.05), because there was no difference in
moisture content between the 2-month-old and the 1-year-
old hardwood whole trees. Therefore, we could not reject
the hypothesis that the productivity obtained when grinding
freshly felled feedstock was the same as that obtained when
grinding 1-year-old feedstock.
For both feedstock ages and for all grate size combina-
tions, the grinder was able to ﬁll a chip van with mixed
conifer slash signiﬁcantly faster (21 min) than with
hardwood whole trees (28 min; P , 0.001). Mixed conifer
slash resulted in consistently higher grinding productivity by
up to 52 percent (HA-3-4-4 with 1-y-old feedstock)
compared with hardwood whole trees (Table 2). The
average productivity for grinding mixed conifer slash was
42.7 BDT/h, and the average productivity when grinding
hardwood whole trees was 34.1 BDT/h. The grinder had
more difﬁcultly comminuting hardwood whole trees due to
its higher wood density and larger diameter. Similar results
were reported by Spinelli et al. (2011). They investigated
the effect of feedstock species on chipping productivity and
found that softwood had a higher chipping productivity than
hardwood because of the high density of hardwood.
Different grate size combinations signiﬁcantly affected
grinding productivity in both feedstock types (P , 0.05)
with the exception of 1-year-old mixed conifer slash (Table
2). Grinding productivity (BDT/h) was dramatically de-
creased by up to 30 percent with a smaller grate size
combination (SA-2-3-3). Arthur et al. (1982) also found
substantial increases in grinding productivity that resulted
from increasing the size of the holes in screens. Grinder
anvil type also inﬂuenced grinding productivity. The use of

holed anvils produced slightly higher productivity than the
use of solid anvils in all treatments except the 1-year-old
hardwood whole trees, but the differences in productivity
were not statistically signiﬁcant (P . 0.05). We had limited
replications on different anvil types in our study, and
additional experimental studies are needed to determine the
effect of grinder anvil type on machine productivity.
Fuel consumption rates
Fuel consumption rate was inﬂuenced by feedstock type,
grate size, and anvil type (Table 2). In this study, however,
no statistical analysis was performed to ﬁnd the effect of
these variables on fuel consumption rates, because the
average fuel consumption rate for each treatment was
determined by dividing the total fuel consumed by the total
feedstock weight produced during each of the ﬁve
replications per test, resulting in the same fuel consumption
per process.
For both feedstock ages, hardwood whole trees had
higher fuel consumption rates than mixed conifer slash. The
average fuel consumption rate for grinding hardwood whole
trees was approximately 64 percent higher than for grinding
mixed conifer slash (Table 2). Similar results were also
reported by Spinelli et al. (2011). They investigated fuel
consumption rates when chipping softwood stems and
hardwood stems and reported that hardwood stems had 7
to 14 percent higher fuel consumption rates than softwood
stems. These results can be attributed to the physical
properties of hardwoods, such as high bending strengths,
stiffness, speciﬁc gravity, and hardness. These properties
vary with species and region, but hardwoods generally are
more dense, ﬁbrous, and harder than softwoods (Haygreen
and Bowyer 1982). Therefore, hardwood takes more energy
to grind and requires more fuel to comminute.
Grinder grate size and type also affected fuel consump-
tion rates in all of the feedstock types (Table 2). As
expected, fuel consumption rate increased with smaller grate
sizes. The SA-2-3-3 combination had 20 to 65 percent
higher fuel consumption rates than the SA-3-4-4 combina-
tion. The differences between both grate combinations were
especially high in hardwood whole trees (65%) compared

with mixed conifer slash (20%). In different anvil
treatments, the use of a holed anvil resulted in less fuel
consumption than the use of a solid anvil in all treatments
except the 1-year-old hardwood whole tree. Conversely, the
solid anvil had slightly lower fuel consumption rates than
the holed anvil in the 1-year-old hardwood whole tree.
Particle size distribution
On average, all treatments produced different percentages
of acceptable-size particles (,3 in. for US Paciﬁc
Northwest applications), which varied from 51 to 89 percent
of the total sample weight (Figs. 3 and 4). Mixed conifer
slash produced a higher proportion of acceptable particle
sizes (84%) than hardwood whole trees (69%) for all
treatments. In addition, the smaller grate size increased the
proportion of the acceptable particle size to as much as 89
percent in mixed conifer slash. However, the results of our
grinding study show a lower proportion of acceptable
particle sizes compared with a past chipping study. Nati et
al. (2010) found that pine logs and limbs had a high
percentage of acceptable-size (3 in.) chips, up to 95
percent of total chip size distribution.
Regression analysis was conducted to investigate the
signiﬁcance of different feedstock types and grate sizes on
particle size distribution. The results of the regression
analysis are presented in Table 3. Only variables with P ,
0.05 were included in the regression equations. Mixed
conifer slash produced smaller particles than hardwood

whole trees. Oversized particles (.3 in.) were signiﬁcantly
more frequent in hardwood whole trees (P , 0.01). The
quantity of ﬁne particles (,0.5 in.) was signiﬁcantly higher
in mixed conifer slash than in hardwood whole trees (P ,
0.05). Similar results have been reported in past chipping
studies (Kofman 2006, Nati et al. 2010, Spinelli et al.
2011).
The moisture content of feedstocks in grinding operations
has signiﬁcant effects on particle size distribution. In
general, the content of ﬁne material decreased with
increasing moisture content, and a more coarse size
distribution was produced from summer-dried trees com-
pared with freshly felled trees (Suadicani and Gamborg
1999, Spinelli et al. 2011). In our study, the age (freshness)
of feedstock did not have any signiﬁcant additional effect in
the oversized class because the 1-year-old material had
similar or higher moisture content than the fresh material.
The effect of feedstock age was only observed in large (2 to
3 in.) and ﬁne (,0.5 in.) particle classes. As expected, fresh
feedstock showed a tendency to produce a smaller
proportion of large particles and a larger proportion of ﬁne
particles.
The effect of different grate size combinations on particle
size distribution was apparent in all of the feedstock types.
The smaller grate size combination signiﬁcantly reduced the
proportion of oversize particles and produced a higher
proportion of acceptable particle sizes. Contrary to our
expectations, the HA-3-4-4 combination did not have a
signiﬁcant effect on size class distribution (P . 0.05).
However, the holed anvil tended to reduce the amount of
oversized particles and increase the amount of particles that
were 1 inch or less when grinding mixed conifer slash (P ,
0.05).
Conclusions
Currently, several biomass conversion technologies (e.g.,
gasiﬁcation, pelletization, and torrefaction) have been
developed for biomass energy production, and most have
fuel feedstock speciﬁcations (e.g., size, moisture content,
and contaminants) that are unique to each technology.
Therefore, matching the right feedstock quality to the
appropriate conversion technology may improve utilization
of forest residues for bioenergy and biobased product
development. In this study, controlled experiments using a
horizontal grinder were conducted to evaluate the effect of
three different grate size combinations on machine produc-
tivity, fuel consumption, and particle size distribution with
two different biomass types (mixed conifer slash and
hardwood whole trees).
Grinding productivity was signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the
feedstock type and grinder grate size. Mixed conifer slash
had a higher grinding productivity than hardwood whole
trees. The average productivity for grinding mixed conifer
slash was 42.7 BDT/h, and the average productivity when
grinding hardwood whole trees was 34.1 BDT/h. Grinding
productivity also dramatically decreased by up to 30 percent
when a smaller grate size combination was used. The use of
a holed anvil produced slightly higher productivity than the
use of a solid anvil. Additional directed studies including
various slash types with different moisture content levels are
needed to determine the effect of grinder anvil type on
machine productivity.
Fuel consumption rate was inﬂuenced by feedstock type,
grinder grate sizes, and grate type. Hardwood whole trees
had higher fuel consumption rates than mixed conifer slash.
Fuel consumption rate increased with smaller grate sizes;
the SA-2-3-3 combination had a 20 to 65 percent higher fuel
consumption rate than the SA-3-4-4 combination.
In the particle size distribution analysis, mixed conifer
slash produced a higher proportion of acceptable-size
particles (,3 in.) than hardwood whole trees. The smaller
grate size combination signiﬁcantly reduced the proportion
of oversize particles while producing a higher proportion
(89%) of acceptable particle sizes in mixed conifer slash.
The use of a holed anvil tended to reduce the amount of
oversized particles and increased the amount of particles
that were 1 inch or less when grinding mixed conifer slash.
However, this was not statistically signiﬁcant. Therefore,
further experiments are needed to ﬁnd stronger evidence for
the effect of holed anvils on particle size reduction. If our
results are supported by future research, the use of a holed
anvil will be the most efﬁcient grinding method, because the
test conducted with a holed anvil had higher grinding
productivity and lower fuel consumption rates with efﬁcient
size reduction of particles.
Moisture content of forest biomass is often considered to
be a critical factor affecting grinding productivity, fuel
consumption, and particle size distribution. In our study,
however, the effect of moisture content on grinding
productivity, fuel consumption, and particle size distribution
was not examined because the moisture content of freshly
felled trees had been quickly reduced, by up to 25 percent,
within 8 weeks of summer. Therefore, further research is
needed to determine the effect of moisture content on
grinding operations.
