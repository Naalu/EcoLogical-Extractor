New White Paper: Western Wildﬁres are Increasing in Size,
Severity and Frequency
As much of the Southwest US grapples with high temperatures and drought
conditions this summer, a new white paper describes how those factors
contribute to increased wildﬁre size, severity and frequency.
 
The paper, “Wildﬁre Trends Across the Western US: Forest Fires Have
Increased in Size, Severity, and Frequency Across Western Forests,”
summarizes the conclusions of a preponderance of literature analyzing
changes to the wildﬁre season across the western US since 1950. It responds
to a minority of critics that maintain that changes in wildﬁre size, frequency and
severity are consistent with historical conditions.
 
An increase in the number of wildﬁres and area burned in most forested
regions of the West is a result of dense forests with high fuel loads, rising
temperatures, increased drought, longer ﬁre seasons, below-average winter
precipitation, and earlier spring snowmelt. This publication strikes up another
timely discussion on living with wildﬁres, wildﬁre prevention and large-scale
restoration efforts.
