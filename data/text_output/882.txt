Abstract
Questions: Do landscape-scale thin and burn restoration treatments have a
long-term, landscape-scale impact on old Pinus ponderosa growth? Is there a rela-
tionship between old P. ponderosa growth and climatic factors, in particular,
drought, before and after restoration treatments?
Location: Northwestern Arizona, USA.
Methods: We looked at old P. ponderosa growth across the landscape in both an
area ‘treated’ by thin and burn restoration treatments, and a neighbouring
untreated area. We re-visited each old P. ponderosa located on permanent 0.1-ha
plots installed across the landscape prior to treatment implementation and
recorded tree status, diameter, aspect, slope and competition from neighbouring
trees. Growth was analysed from shallow increment cores taken from each tree
at breast height (1.37 m). Comparisons of growth between the treated and
untreated areas were carried out using regional proxy and instrumental Palmer
drought severity index values and instrument precipitation data.
Results: We found signiﬁcant differences in precipitation and temperature
between the treated and untreated areas, indicating a drier, less advantageous
climate in the untreated area. Old trees in the treated area responded less nega-
tively in diameter growth to treatments; both treatment and abiotic site factors
were important in predicting post-treatment growth. All old trees grew slowly
during drought years; however, old trees in the treated area grew better after
three recent drought years than old trees in the untreated area.
Conclusions: Old P. ponderosa diameter growth increased following restoration,
though not immediately. Old trees in the treated area also grew better in the
years after drought than old trees in the untreated area. Restoration, or similar
treatments removing small, neighbouring trees may be critical in maintaining
old P. ponderosa in the landscape, particularly under future climate change and
increasing drought frequency in the western USA.
Introduction
Throughout the western United States, restoration treat-
ments have become a popular method for reducing the
likelihood of catastrophic disturbances (Covington &
Moore 1994; Allen et al. 2002). Many restoration efforts
have focused on the ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Law-
son & C. Lawson var. scopulorum Engelm; hereafter P. pon-
derosa) forest type in the USA, particularly in Montana
(Fielder 2000; Sala et al. 2005; Dodson & Fielder 2006;
Metlen & Fielder 2006; Fajardo et al. 2007; Peters & Sala
2008; Six & Skov 2009), the Inland northwest (Young-
blood et al. 2004, 2006; Busse et al. 2009; Harrod et al.
2009), and the southwest (Covington & Moore 1994;
Waltz et al. 2003; Fule et al. 2005, 2006). Pinus ponderosa
forests historically had open-grown, park-like structures
maintained by frequent ﬁre; Euro-American settlement
brought grazing, logging and ﬁre suppression and exclu-
sion, which led to increased tree densities and a lack of het-
erogeneity in forest stands (Covington & Moore 1994).
As the challenges of climate change loom, an array of
management tools will be key in mitigating its negative

impacts (Millar et al. 2007; Malmsheimer et al. 2008). In
recent years, many studies have reported on the effects of
restoration treatments on P. ponderosa ecosystems (i.e. Fee-
ney et al. 1998; Stone et al. 1999; Kolb et al. 2001; Skov
et al. 2004; Wallin et al. 2004, 2008; Martin et al. 2005;
Sala et al. 2005; Dodson & Fielder 2006; Metlen & Fielder
2006; McGlone et al. 2009, 2010; Kalies et al. 2010). Most
research has focused on the response of second-growth
trees to such treatments; only within the past decade have
long-term effects on old P. ponderosa been studied (Feeney
et al. 1998; Stone et al. 1999; Kolb et al. 2001; Latham &
Tappeiner 2002; Skov et al. 2004; Wallin et al. 2004).
Large, old trees are considered important landscape com-
ponents for a number of reasons (e.g. carbon sequestra-
tion, wildlife habitat, genetic diversity and as recorders of
past disturbances and climate), but are declining in abun-
dance (Abella et al. 2007). Their ability to persist relies on
their ability to withstand discrete disturbance events and
long-term climate change throughout their large range
from Mexico to Canada (Kolb et al. 2007).
Old P. ponderosa in the western US has been deﬁned in
many ways (Kolb et al. 2001, 2007; Latham & Tappeiner
2002; McDowell et al. 2003; Roccaforte et al. 2009). In
northern Arizona, trees existing before Euro-American
settlement are usually identiﬁable by having a diameter at
breast height (DBH) of 37 cm or more, and yellowing bark
colour (White 1985); these criteria are still used commonly
by researchers (Fule et al. 1997; Roccaforte et al. 2009)
and the ones we adhere to in this paper (hereafter ‘old
trees’).
Old P. ponderosa growth response to treatment and
drought
Previously, foresters assumed that old trees would not
respond positively to restoration [restoration being pri-
marily in the form of basal area reduction treatments
(as described in Latham & Tappeiner 2002)]. However,
recently, old trees have been shown to respond posi-
tively to both increased CO2 concentration and basal
area reduction (Latham & Tappeiner 2002; McDowell
et al. 2003; Phillips et al. 2008). In northern Arizona,
old P. ponderosa increase in both basal area increment
(BAI) and carbon isotope discrimination in response to
treatment,
indicating
increases
in
water
availability,
crown-level stomatal conductance and photosynthetic
capacity (Stone et al. 1999; McDowell et al. 2003).
However, a post-treatment lag effect in old P. ponderosa
growth, extending for more than 5 yrs in some cases
has been noted (Latham & Tappeiner 2002; McDowell
et al. 2003). The lag effect may be a result of shifting
carbon allocation patterns in a post-treatment environ-
ment (Feeney et al. 1998; McDowell et al. 2003).
Although drought is already common in the southwest-
ern US and widely recognized as one of the major limiting
factors on tree growth (McDowell et al. 2003; Adams &
Kolb 2005 and citations therein), future climate predic-
tions include increased occurrence, duration and severity
of droughts as well as increased temperatures (Cayan et al.
2010; Dominguez et al. 2010; Gutzler & Robbins 2011). In
northern Arizona, water potentials, leaf nitrogen and sto-
matal conductance were higher for old trees in thinned or
thinned and burned stands than in untreated stands 3 and
7 yrs after treatment, even during drought years with 60%
to 72% lower than average winter and spring precipitation
(Feeney et al. 1998; Wallin et al. 2004). Management
actions that reduce tree density and competition, such as
thinning, burning or a combination may help mitigate the
effects of climatic shifts (Feeney et al. 1998; Wallin et al.
2004; Fule et al. 2007), although severe drought periods
negatively affecting tree growth may also increase tree sus-
ceptibility to other damaging agents (Fischer et al. 2010).
Understanding the relationships between climate, particu-
larly drought, restoration treatments and growth of old
trees at large scales can better inform managers of methods
to maintain old P. ponderosa in the landscape even under
differing climate situations (Kolb et al. 2007). However,
research investigating these relationships at large scales is
lacking. The research we describe here begins to address
these complex issues.
Objectives
In 1995, a group of managers and scientists from the
Bureau of Land Management, Arizona Game and Fish
Department, and the Ecological Restoration Institute and
School of Forestry at Northern Arizona University estab-
lished the Mt. Trumbull Ponderosa Pine Restoration Pro-
ject (hereafter ‘Mt. Trumbull’) in the Uinkaret Mountains
of northwestern Arizona. One aspect of restoration that
has not been adequately addressed is the effect of restora-
tion on growth during climatic events such as drought,
especially on a landscape scale. Using tree rings to examine
this relationship, our objectives in this project were to: (1)
determine if a landscape-scale treatment effect occurred
on growth of old P. ponderosa at Mt. Trumbull; and (2)
examine the relationship between old P. ponderosa growth
and climatic factors, in particular, drought, at Mt. Trum-
bull.
Methods
Study site
Mount Trumbull is located within the Grand Canyon-
Parashant National Monument, AZ, at an elevation of
2,000–2,500 m (Fig. 1). The dominant overstorey species

are ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson
var. scopulorum Engelm.) and Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii
Nutt.), while New Mexico locust (Robinia neomexicana A.
Gray), pi~non pine (Pinus edulis Engelm.) and Utah juniper
(Juniperus osteosperma [Torr.] Little) exist as scattered com-
ponents of the landscape. Basaltic parent materials consti-
tute the major aspect of soil composition at Mt. Trumbull.
Between 1992 and 2008, annual precipitation averaged
44.9 cm, while average temperatures for January and July
were 0.4 °C and 21.3 °C, respectively (Fule et al. 2007;
Roccaforte et al. 2009). The region has been in a prolonged
drought since 1996 (Western Regional Climate Center
accessed on 31 May 2012). The bulk of the region’s precipi-
tation falls as snow in winter months and rain during
the summer monsoon season (Table 1; Fule et al. 2007;
Roccaforte et al. 2009).
Restoration treatments
The Mt. Trumbull project and corresponding study area is
about 1,200 ha in size, with nearly 500 contiguous
untreated
hectares
(hereafter
‘untreated
area’).
The
700 ha adjacent to the untreated area were treated by
thinning and burning (hereafter ‘treated area;; Roccaforte
et al. 2009). Mechanical tree removal treatments, consid-
ered restoration treatments, were implemented between
1996 and 2003 (Table 2) and designed to be characteristic
of patterns of tree composition and spatial arrangement
during pre-Euro-American settlement (pre-1870) condi-
tions (Covington & Moore 1994; Waltz et al. 2003). To
achieve this goal, trees that began growing prior to 1870
were not harvested, and wherever evidence (live tree,
snag, log, stump or stump hole) of pre-1870 materials were
found, an average of either 1.5 or three post-1870 trees
were left standing, if they were within 9.1 m of the evi-
dence. Where suitable trees were not found within 9.1 m,
the radius was extended to 18.2 m in order to leave 1.5
trees >40.6 cm DBH, per evidence, as replacement trees. If
there were no trees over 40.6 cm DBH, three trees under
40.6 cm were left as replacements. Restoration treatments
of this kind would theoretically leave 150–300% more

Restoration effects on old P. ponderosa growth

trees than were present in 1870. This allowed managers
ﬂexibility in retaining enough trees if there were mistakes
in pre-1870 reconstruction efforts (using dendroecological
methods described in Waltz et al. 2003) or un-predicted
post-treatment mortality. Additionally, litter and duff were
raked about 30 cm away from the base of old trees to mini-
mize ﬁre-caused mortality (Waltz et al. 2003). Prescribed
ﬁre treatments were carried out by logging unit (stand)
rather than across the landscape. Different areas burned at
different times, and not necessarily immediately following
thinning treatments. Additionally, some areas received a
second burn entry between 2004 and 2008 while other
areas had only been treated with ﬁre once. This compli-
cated treatment schedule inﬂuenced the decision to use a
generic treatment year (1998) rather than time since treat-
ment for each unit (Table 2).
Selection of untreated and treated areas in the Mt.
Trumbull landscape was not random due to the inﬂuence
of land ownership patterns on the ability to implement
treatments (Roccaforte et al. 2009); however, the areas are
adjacent. A missing component of the original research
conducted at Mt. Trumbull was a comparison of abiotic
conditions between the untreated and treatment areas
(Roccaforte et al. 2009); we thus included this comparison
in our research because of the important inﬂuence of abi-
otic factors on tree growth. To compare the overall abiotic
similarities between the two treatment areas, we collected
data on elevation, slope, aspect and soil bulk density. We
compared weather conditions between the two areas using
RAWS (Western Regional Climate Center accessed 11
October 2010) weather station data (1992–2008) represen-
tative of each treatment area. The data from these RAWS
stations were used only in comparing the treatment areas,
whereas growth–climate correlations were analysed using
regional values as described below. The respective RAWS
stations were the Mt. Logan station, representing the
untreated area, and Nixon Flats station, representing the
treatment. These stations were chosen to be representative
of their respective treatment types because of their aspect
and elevation relative to average treatment area aspect and
elevation and location within 2 km of each treatment area.
Soil samples were taken between 1–2 m from the base of a
randomly selected subset of old trees [treated (n = 20) and
untreated (n = 26)] at Mt. Trumbull. Bulk density and soil
texture were calculated for each sample. For further soil
sample processing information, see Erickson (2011).
Tree growth
Plot measurements
To characterize old tree growth patterns across the land-
scape, we re-visited a subset of the original 117 permanent,
0.1-ha rectangular plots (20 9 50 m, located perpendicu-
lar to the slope on a 300-m grid) established in 1995 and
ﬁrst re-measured in 2003 (Fule et al. 2002; Roccaforte
et al. 2009). We re-visited each of 53 original plots that
contained old trees, including 18 plots in the treated area
(Table 2) and 35 plots in the untreated area. Within these
plots there were 34 old trees measured in the treated area
and 81 measured in the untreated area. Original, pretreat-
ment overstorey (>15 cm DBH) measurements included
species, DBH and a tree condition class assessment, ranging
from live to dead with varying decay classes (Thomas et al.
1979). All live old trees were cored at 0.4 m above the
ground level to pith. Measurements in 2003 were more
extensive adding dwarf mistletoe rating, total height and
height to live crown base.
During the summers of 2009 and 2010, we re-measured
all old trees within the 53 plot subset. Measurements taken
on each old tree included DBH, total height, crown base
height (both of lowest live foliage and lowest live branch),
crown width, percentage slope, aspect, elevation and the
condition class assessment. We also assessed each tree for
dwarf mistletoe, which can affect growth, but found none
present. Crown width measurements were taken from the
centre of each tree in each of the four cardinal directions.
Competition was assessed using live basal area within a
8.32-m plot (about 218 m2) where the tree centre was the
plot centre. Data collected from these competition plots
was used to calculate basal area (m2ha1), trees per hect-
are (TPH) and stand density index (SDI; Reineke 1933).
Stand density index is a measure of relative stand density
that accounts for both size and number of trees in a given
area; it is standardized by comparing it to the maximum
SDI for the species. In P. ponderosa, the accepted maximum
SDI (Imperial units, SDImax) is 450 (Long & Shaw 2005).
We used the even-aged computation for SDI because, with
few exceptions, trees located within the competition plots
were P. ponderosa of similar size. We recorded bole char
presence in areas that received prescribed burning within
the previous 2 yrs. Additionally, one shallow core contain-
ing at least 30 yrs of growth was extracted from each old
tree (live and dead) at breast height (1.4 m).

Restoration effects on old P. ponderosa growth
C.C. Erickson and K.M. Waring

Data were analysed using JMP (v. 8.0; SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC, US) and R (v. 2.15.1; R Foundation for Sta-
tistical Computing, Vienna, AT). Pooled error one-way
ANOVAs, and paired t-tests were used for all analyses
except where assumptions of homoscedasticity or normal-
ity assumptions were violated. In those cases, nonparamet-
ric Wilcoxon signed rank tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests
and Welch tests were used to assess differences between
means. All aspect readings were transformed before statis-
tical analysis (Beers et al. 1966). Due to the lack of treat-
ment replication (n = 1 untreated area and 1 treated area),
when comparing plot-based variables, we pooled all values
by plot, then averaged plot values to obtain an average for
each treatment type. Additionally, because of the lack of
replication, we would advise restraint in extrapolating our
results to other sites.
Increment core processing and analysis
Dendrochronology is a common method of relating tree
growth to environmental factors such as climate (Fritts
1976). Cores were kept frozen until processing, upon
which each core was glued and mounted, then sanded
with increasingly ﬁne sandpaper (to 600 grit). The cores
were then scanned into a computer for ring-width
analysis and cross-dating in WinDENDRO (v. 2001a;
Regent Instruments Inc., Quebec, CA). Cross-dating was
then veriﬁed using COFECHA (Holmes 1983). One tree
in the untreated area was excluded from all growth
analyses because its growth was over 6 SD from the
mean (Grubb’s critical value: 2.9592, G = 6.3926). All
analyses based on ring widths used the cross-dated ser-
ies. To meet our ﬁrst objective, we analysed growth
response using basal area increment (BAI) and 1998 as
the ‘treatment year’. We chose 1998 because it fell in
the middle of the period of treatments and allowed us
to look at post-treatment growth over 10 yrs at Mt.
Trumbull. There were no trees treated with both thin-
ning and ﬁre in the same year, thus precluding the use
of a single treatment year for individual trees or plots.
BAI was calculated using a bark thickness equation for
ponderosa pine (Myers 1963) and working from the
outermost ring inward for each annual increment based
on
raw
ring
widths.
Increment
values
were
then
summed to obtain growth increment for pre- and post-
treatment growth comparisons by time period. Basal
area increment before (BAIB) and after (BAIA) treat-
ment, and a ratio of BAIA/BAIB were analysed to
assess treatment effects for 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 7- and 10-
yr periods centred around, but not including, 1998.
Additionally, to detect overall treatment response, pre-
1998 BAI for each time period (1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 7-
and 10-yr period) and for the treated and untreated
areas were regressed against one another and compared
to a similar post-treatment regression of treated against
untreated BAI. Similar methods of comparing pre- and
post-disturbance BAI were used by Latham & Tappeiner
(2002) and Lloret et al. (2011).
To meet our second objective, we compared BAI
between the treated and untreated areas during drought
periods, and analysed the long-term (1950–2008) rela-
tionship between climate and growth using ring width
indices. Raw ring width series were standardized using
ARSTAN (Cook & Holmes 1997), and either a modiﬁed
negative exponential curve or a least squares, linear
regression was ﬁt to decrease the effect of the biological
aging trend seen in raw ring width series, and retain
more high-frequency variation (Adams & Kolb 2005).
The residuals of the standardized series were used in
analyses since standardized ring widths did not meet
normality assumptions for statistical analyses, and main-
tained high autocorrelation (0.504) following ARSTAN
standardization (Fritts & Swetnam 1989), while residuals
met normality assumptions and had low autocorrelation
(<0.01). We compared the resulting ring width indices
(RWI) to the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI,
Palmer 1965). PDSI is a regional index of drought condi-
tions based on precipitation and potential evapotranspi-
ration. We obtained regional tree ring-based PDSI proxy
values from grid point 087 (Cook & Krusic 2004), and
regional PDSI values and precipitation measurements
calculated from instrument data from the National Cli-
matic Data Center, USA, Arizona, Region 1 (National
Climatic Data Center accessed 11 October 2010). The cli-
mate variables just discussed indicate regional-scale cli-
matic
conditions.
Correlations
between
the
regional
National Climatic Data Center values and the local val-
ues (RAWS) of precipitation and temperature were sig-
niﬁcant
and
positively
correlated
(precipitation:
untreated
R2 = 0.54,
treated
R2 = 0.75;
temperature:
untreated R2 = 0.96, treated R2 = 0.95). These values
were used for the long-term growth and climate analysis
rather than the local values because of the brevity of cli-
matic data from the local stations (available only from
1992–present). We used Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient
with a Bonferroni correction to test for signiﬁcant corre-
lations between regional climate variables (i.e. PDSI and
seasonal precipitation) and RWI (P < 0.05) between
1950
and
2008.
Mt.
Trumbull
experienced
seven
extreme drought periods between 1950–2008: 1951,
1956, 1963, 1977, 1996, 2000 and 2002. In each of these
years, the BAI increase in the year immediately follow-
ing the drought ranged between 103–306%; no other
years showed an increase over 100%. We therefore
chose these 7 yrs for all analysis related to drought. The
signiﬁcance level was set at a = 0.05 for all analyses.

Restoration effects on old P. ponderosa growth

Results
Differences between the untreated and treated areas
In the 1992–2008 period, annual (hydrologic year; Oct–
Sept) and winter (Nov–March) precipitation were signiﬁ-
cantly different between the untreated and treated areas,
with the untreated area receiving less precipitation than
the treated area (Table 1). Annual growing season precipi-
tation (April–Oct) was not signiﬁcantly different between
the treatment types, nor was monsoonal and pre-mon-
soonal precipitation (Table 1). Annual and growing season
maximum temperatures were signiﬁcantly higher in the
treated area than in the untreated area, while annual win-
ter maximum temperature was signiﬁcantly lower in the
treated area than in the untreated area (Table 1). Monthly
average wind speed (ms1) was also signiﬁcantly higher
in the untreated area than in the treated area (Table 1).
However, slope, aspect and elevation were not signiﬁ-
cantly different between treatment types (Table 1). Soils in
both treatment types were clay loams, and bulk density did
not differ between treatments (Table 1).

Average age of sampled old trees with datable cores was
255 yrs in the untreated area and 223 yrs in the treated
area with ranges of 140–422 and 151–553 yrs, respec-
tively. We did not statistically compare mean ages between
treatment areas due to lack of centre dates and presence of
rot in many cores.
All measures of competition and density were signiﬁ-
cantly higher in the untreated area than in the treated area
(Table 3). We avoided direct comparisons of DBH, height
and
crown
characteristics
between
the
treated
and
untreated areas because DBH was signiﬁcantly different
between the areas prior to treatment implementation (data
not shown). For further pre-treatment information on
density and tree characteristics, see Roccaforte et al.
(2009). In the treated area, 22 trees (65%) had measurable
bole char, but we found no relationship between char and
growth response.
Landscape-scale treatment effects on growth
We found signiﬁcant differences in growth between 1950
and 2008, with trees in the treated area growing 43% fas-
ter than trees in the untreated area (growth trend depicted
in Fig. 2). However, BAIB was not signiﬁcantly different
between treatments in any of the analysed time periods (1
to 10 yrs). Average BAIA did not differ signiﬁcantly
between treatment types from 1 to 7 yrs after treatment,
but did differ signiﬁcantly after 10 yrs (P = 0.0384). The
ratio of BAI after treatment to BAI before treatment
(BAIA/BAIB) was signiﬁcantly higher in the treated area
than in the untreated area, beginning in year 3 and contin-
uing through year 10 post-treatment (Fig. 3). Additionally,
trees in the treated area responded less negatively to the
severe drought conditions that occurred during 2001–2002
(average PDSI = 4.3), as shown by the signiﬁcant
increase in BAIA as compared to BAIB by year 10 post-
treatment. In the ﬁrst year after treatment, BAIA in the
treated area was signiﬁcantly higher than BAIB, but by the
third year (2001), BAIB was higher, although not signiﬁ-
cantly. By 7 yrs after treatment, there were no signiﬁcant
differences between BAIB and BAIA, although BAIA was
higher. Then, by 10 yrs after treatment, BAIA was signiﬁ-
cantly higher than BAIB (Fig. 4).

Restoration effects on old P. ponderosa growth
C.C. Erickson and K.M. Waring

In the untreated area, there were no signiﬁcant differ-
ences between BAIB and BAIA in the ﬁrst 2 yrs after 1998,
but by the third year, BAIB was signiﬁcantly higher than
BAIA, and remained that way through 2008, (post-treat-
ment year 10; Fig. 4). In the untreated area, only 12% of
trees had returned to pre-1998 growth rates after 5 yrs,
and, after 10 yrs, only 20% of trees had returned to pre-
1998 levels. On the other hand, in the treated area, 31% of
the trees had returned to pre-treatment growth rates after
5 yrs, and, after 10 yrs, 79% of trees had returned to or
surpassed pre-treatment levels.
Slope comparisons of regressions for untreated and trea-
ted BAI for each pre- and post-treatment time period
(1950–1998 and 1999–2008, respectively) were not signiﬁ-
cantly different (P > 0.05, data not shown). Regional PDSI
was not signiﬁcantly different between each pre- vs. post-
treatment time period (P > 0.05, data not shown). Addi-
tionally, when BAIA was regressed against competition
variables (BA m2ha1, TPH and SDI), regressions were not
signiﬁcant for the untreated or the treated area (P > 0.05,
data not shown).
Climatic effects on growth
Ring width index in the treated and untreated areas was
signiﬁcantly and positively correlated with annual (Oct–
Sept) and winter (Nov–Mar) precipitation, annual growing
season and winter PDSI, pre-monsoonal and monsoonal
PDSI, and a regional PDSI derived from tree rings
(P < 0.05; Fig. 5).
Between 1950 and 2008, trees in the treated area grew
faster during most years (Fig. 2). Growth differences
between the untreated and treated areas tended to be min-
imized
during drought
years.
Six-year
responses
to
drought were not signiﬁcantly different between the trees
in the treated and untreated areas before 1996 (Fig. 6).
However, there were signiﬁcant differences in the 1996,
2000 and 2002 drought periods between trees in the trea-

seven time periods. All old trees included. Treatment year was 1998; the

Restoration effects on old P. ponderosa growth

ted and untreated areas (P = 0.0006, 0.0030 and 0.0071,
respectively; Fig. 6).
Discussion
In this study, we faced unforeseen issues related to initial
1995 treatment area designation, including signiﬁcant abi-
otic differences between the treated and untreated areas.
Additionally, the broad span of implementation years of
thinning and burning treatments prevented growth analy-
sis by a single treatment year for individual trees. Despite
these obstacles, we have shown a clear, positive treatment
effect on growth across the Mt. Trumbull landscape.
As a growing body of literature reports, we found that
old trees have the capacity to respond positively to thin-
ning and burning treatments. Just as importantly, we have
shown that restoration treatments improved old trees’ abil-
ity to recover and persist after and during severe drought.
We saw signiﬁcant long-term (1950–2008) growth differ-
ences between the treated and untreated areas. However,
we believe that the post-treatment growth responses in
the treated area drove the signiﬁcant long-term differences
since pre-treatment differences in growth were not signiﬁ-
cant. Based on pre-treatment, long-term trends in growth,
one would expect that, in the absence of treatment, the
treated and untreated areas would respond similarly
through time. Differing abiotic factors between treated and
untreated areas alone could not explain the observed post-
treatment growth differences. Abiotic differences existed
even before the measured trees established at Mt. Trum-
bull, and there were no signiﬁcant growth differences
between the treated and untreated areas until after treat-
ments occurred. Because of the clear divergence in growth
and signiﬁcance in our post-treatment growth analysis, we
are convinced that treatments made a substantial impact
on conditions in the treated area relative to the untreated
area; however, tree growth is clearly driven by a complex
suite of interrelated biotic and abiotic factors.
One of the explanations for the signiﬁcant growth
increases in the treated area may be increased resource
availability after treatments. As we had predicted, radial
growth was signiﬁcantly related to winter precipitation.
Winter precipitation falls as snow, and the amount of snow
accumulation affects spring root and shoot growth (Gay-
lord et al. 2007). In Arizona, winter precipitation is most
important for established trees and deeply rooted shrubs,
while growing season precipitation is more important for
grasses, seedlings and other understorey components
(Pearson 1950; Weltzin & McPherson 1997). After treat-
ment, which we believe has increased resource availabil-
ity, trees would have more access to moisture resources,
and the ability to maintain physiological processes such as
photosynthesis (McDowell et al. 2003). This would allow
trees in the treated area to assimilate more carbon for use
in providing resin defence against pests and pathogens,
and increasing tree biomass (McDowell et al. 2003; Wallin
et al. 2004).
Restoration treatments can also enhance long-term old
tree growth after multiple instances of acute drought stress
and long-term regional drought in the southwestern US.
The severe droughts of 1996, 2000 and 2002 appear to
have detrimentally affected tree growth, but only in the
short term in the treated area. Additionally, 1996 was a
particularly severe drought year (PDSI = 5.8) that corre-
sponded with the onset of treatments at Mt. Trumbull. We
found that the relative growth difference following
droughts between the treated and untreated areas not only
increased after 1996, but became even higher following
the 2000 and 2002 drought years. If trends for drought
response in previous drought periods had held, the differ-
ence between the untreated and treated areas would have
decreased as time since drought increased. However, we
found a consistent increasing divergence in growth
between the treated and untreated areas. Feeney et al.
(1998) and Wallin et al. (2004) showed that beneﬁcial
effects (i.e. higher pre-dawn water potential and soil water
content) of thinning and burning treatments on old trees,
with the exception of leaf nitrogen levels, continued into
the seventh year after treatment, even after two extreme
drought years in northern Arizona. Increased availability
of water and nutrients, as well as continued increases in
stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis likely drove
the continued differentiation of tree growth between the
treatments (Wallin et al. 2004).

Restoration effects on old P. ponderosa growth
C.C. Erickson and K.M. Waring

Unlike the ﬁndings of Latham & Tappeiner (2002),
BAIA was not explained by stand density or other above-
ground competition variables. We did not see long-term
negative effects of ﬁre or drought on growth as Swezy &
Agee (1991) and Fule et al. (2002) reported on cinder soils
after ﬁre damaged roots in P. ponderosa stands in Oregon
and Arizona. Lloret et al. (2011) found that competitive
release after drought periods did not affect the growth
response of old trees. Additionally, it may be that competi-
tion around old trees must be reduced further to show
these effects (Skov et al. 2004, described below). The inﬂu-
ence that above-ground competition has on growth at Mt.
Trumbull is likely secondary to the interaction of climatic
variables such as precipitation, temperature, aspect and/or
below-ground competition.
The old tree growth response to treatments occurred
after a lag of 5–10 yrs. Statistical signiﬁcance in growth dif-
ferences between BAIB and BAIA within the treated area
and BAIA relative to the untreated area did not appear
until 10-yrs post-treatment. Although it is possible that at
least some of the lag may be attributable to our analysis
using a generic treatment year rather than analysing each
tree from a speciﬁc treatment year, Latham & Tappeiner
(2002) reported a similar lag in response time. One possible
reason for such lags in basal area growth could be that car-
bon resources were diverted to increased root growth in
the years immediately following treatment as a response to
reduced below-ground competition and increased mois-
ture availability (McDowell et al. 2003). The growth lag
could also be due to variability in post-treatment tree den-
sity, particularly near old trees.
The combined effect of small sample and plot sizes to
measure a relatively rare landscape feature may have
resulted in underestimates of old tree density and over- or
underestimates of overall stand densities (Wagner et al.
2010). Our stand density measures were restricted to the
area immediately surrounding old trees, and are not truly
representative of overall stand density, but only the imme-
diate competitive environment of the old trees (Shaw &
Long 2010). In the treated area, old trees are in competi-
tion, but at just over 30% of maximum SDI, the competi-
tion is low. Conversely, in the untreated area, old tree
competition is very high, at 92% of maximum SDI. With
SDI values indicating competition in both treatment areas,
it is not surprising to see a lag in radial growth response in
the treated area, and continued diminished growth in the
untreated area. Additionally, we report untreated basal
area at 9.1 m2ha1 and about 97 treesha1. Roccaforte
et al. (2009) described a post-treatment basal area of
18.9 m2ha1 and 399 treesha1 for the Mt. Trumbull
landscape based on data from many more plots and with-
out bias toward old trees as we have in this study. Skov
et al. (2004) found that density reductions to an average
basal area of about 13 m2ha1 were required before
immediate growth responses could be expected in old
trees. However, Skov et al. (2004) based their ﬁndings on
average stand values, indicating that densities near old
trees may need to be reduced even more (<9 m2ha1) to
achieve immediate growth increases.
Conclusion
We have shown that restoration treatments can positively
inﬂuence even old trees, improving their growth and
capacity for survival in the long term. With proper man-
agement to reduce and maintain lower stand densities, old
trees can persist in the landscape even with drought and
other stressors. Most old P. ponderosa in the treated area
have had less negative growth responses to recent
extended drought events, and restoration treatments at
Mt. Trumbull have facilitated increased growth of old trees
in the landscape over the 10-yr time period we studied.
Thinning and restoration treatments are key to safeguard-
ing forests from increased susceptibility to droughts and
contributing factors of mortality (i.e. insects or pathogens)
as well as increased susceptibility to wildﬁres (Waring et al.
2009). Maintaining a relatively fast growing, vigorous sec-
ond-growth component as future old tree replacements
should also be a consideration for management. Old
P. ponderosa can be a key feature of future southwestern
US forests with appropriate adaptive management strate-
gies.
