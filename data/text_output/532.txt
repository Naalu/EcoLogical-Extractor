Abstract
Wildﬁres have decimated forests of Pinus nigra in the Mediterranean Basin in recent decades, but little is known about the ﬁre ecology of this
native species. We sampled three small relict forest sites on Sierra Turmell, Castello´n, Valencia, northeastern Spain, to determine forest structure
and past ﬁre events. The forest was characterized by relatively large and old trees (mean 158 year, max 362 year). Fire history was affected by
obliteration of some ﬁre scars, but we determined 11 ﬁre dates in the past 172 years. The minimum ﬁre-free interval was 2 years, maximum 57
years. Fire dates were not linked with dry climatic conditions, possibly due to occupational burning by pastoralists. Compared to inventory data
averages for P. nigra in northeastern Spain (Catalunya), the old forest at Sierra Turmell supported over twice the basal area and over 2.5 times the
biomass, with a comparable advantage in terms of carbon storage. Carbon sequestration, on the other hand, was over six times higher in the younger
forests. The relict forest at Sierra Turmell provides evidence of multi-aged forest structure persisting through numerous surface ﬁres over several
centuries. This example may be useful for guiding management of younger forests and for ecological restoration of degraded areas.

1. Introduction
Wildﬁres pose the greatest threat to the sustainability of pine
ecosystems in the Mediterranean Basin (Barbe´ro et al., 1988;
Tapias et al., 2001; Leone and Lovreglio, 2004; Pausas, 2004).
Fire-climate relationships, resilience to disturbance, and ways
in which humans can ameliorate environmental degradation
have been identiﬁed as three of the top eight research needs for
forests in the Mediterranean region (Scarascia-Mugnozza et al.,
2000). Policies for conservation in the Mediterranean region
range from the European Union to individual nations and
localities; the overarching goals of Pan-European strategies
focus on forest sustainability, protection of native species, and
maintenance of the resource base (Leone and Lovreglio, 2004).
However, it is difﬁcult to develop strategies for conservation of
native pine species because information on historical forest
dynamics, fuel arrangement, and ﬁre disturbance is very limited
(Barbe´ro et al., 1988). At present, therefore, the historical ﬁre
regimes of ﬁre-adapted Mediterranean pine forests are of great
interest from many perspectives: ecological, management, and
social.
Fire regimes in Mediterranean pine forests are poorly
understood and have been largely inferred from morphological,
chemical, and life history traits (Barbe´ro et al., 1988; Keeley
and Zedler, 1998; Tapias et al., 2004). Based on life history and
morphological traits, surface ﬁre regimes are believed to have
predominated in Pinus nigra, P. sylvestris, and P. uncinata
forests (Tapias et al., 2004). Surface-ﬁre-adapted species
(hereafter referred to as ‘‘ﬁre-adapted’’) do not have an
effective canopy seed bank and seeds are susceptible to heat
(Alvarez et al., 2007), so regeneration of P. nigra and P.
sylvestris forests after wildﬁre has been poor (Habrouk et al.,
1999), to the point of extirpation of some of these forests
following ﬁre (Pausas et al., 2004). These species are important

ecologically (Camarero and Gutie´rrez, 2002) and commer-
cially, covering approximately 3.8 million hectares (ha) in the
Mediterranean Basin (Leone and Lovreglio, 2004). Severe
wildﬁres in recent years have been especially damaging in these
forests (Pausas et al., 2004); between 1990 and 2000, over 25%
of the P. nigra forests in Catalunya, northeastern Spain, were
killed by severe ﬁre and post-ﬁre regeneration from seed has
been minimal (Espelta et al., 2003).
Reliable quantitative information could be developed from
direct measurement of ﬁre-regime evidence, as done in North
America and northern Europe, using ﬁre-scarred trees dated
with dendrochronological techniques (e.g., Zackrisson, 1980;
Swetnam and Baisan, 2003; Wallenius et al., 2004), forest
composition, age, and structure (e.g., Floyd et al., 2000;
Niklasson and Granstrom, 2000), historical ﬁre records (e.g.,
Fule´ et al., 2003), and measurement of relict sites with
relatively intact disturbance regimes (e.g., Heyerdahl and
Alvarado, 2003). Some of these methods have been applied in
the western Mediterranean Basin. For example, Bosch and
Gutie´rrez (1996) inferred regeneration dynamics of high-
elevation P. uncinata stands in the Spanish Pyrenees from
mapped plots; Lloret and Marı´ (2001) contrasted modern and
medieval ﬁre regimes using historical records of payments to
ﬁreﬁghters; Rozas (2004) applied dendroecological methods to
reconstruct age and human-caused disturbance to an old-
growth pollarded oak woodland in northern Spain. The only
published Spanish study using ﬁre-scarred trees is by Vega-
Hidalgo (2000), who reconstructed the ﬁre regime of a P.
pinaster forest in the Sierra Bemeja, Ma´laga, ﬁnding 13 surface
ﬁres between 1817 and 1991.
Our goal in the present study was to expand upon the limited
information on ﬁre-adapted Mediterranean forests by determin-
ing historical structure and ﬁre disturbance of relict P. nigra
forests in northeastern Spain. The feasibility of ﬁre-regime
reconstruction in the Mediterranean Basin has been discounted
on the basis of long-term human disturbance and little evidence
of old forests (Lloret and Marı´, 2001). However, P. nigra can
live for many centuries (Tapias et al., 2004) and has been used
extensively for dendroclimatology (Ferna´ndez et al., 1996).
Human disturbance
has been a critical ecological and
evolutionary force throughout the world, but in the Mediterra-
nean Basin the intention would not be to determine ‘‘pristine’’
forest conditions; instead, the important issue is to reconstruct
ﬁre regimes in the recent centuries prior to the abrupt changes
associated with the modern period of industrialization and
climate change (Pausas, 2004). Unfortunately, because P. nigra
grows at lower elevations, the native forests have been almost
entirely converted to non-forested land uses or to tree
plantations, obliterating evidence of the historical forest
structure.
Through searches of forest inventory data and discussions
with foresters and ecologists in the northeastern Spanish
autonomous regions of Arago´n, Valencia, and Catalunya, we
identiﬁed just a few possible locations where old P. nigra stands
might exist. Visiting these sites, we found that old trees only
persisted on steep cliff faces or rock outcrops; accessible trees
had been cut long ago. However, at the crest of the Sierra
Turmell in Castello´n, northern Valencia, we located a small
remnant forest of old P. nigra trees. We took advantage of this
unique site to ask the following questions: (1) What were the
structural characteristics of the old forest in this dry region? (2)
Could ﬁre-regime attributes be reconstructed from ﬁre-scarred
trees and age distributions? (3) What was the relationship
between climate, ﬁre, and tree growth? Finally, (4) could the
historical features of the old forest be useful for modern
management planning in the context of changing climate and
ﬁre hazard?
2. Methods
2.1. Field methods
The study sites were located at approximately 1000 m
elevation in the Sierra Turmell, Castello´n province (lat
408350N, lon 0840E), on public lands managed by the
Generalitat Valenciana. The longest climate record in the
region, with data beginning in 1920, was from the Morella
weather station (970 m elevation). Data were missing for
numerous years; we used records from other weather stations at
Sant Mateu (325 m), La Pobla de Benifassa (705 m), and Xert
(515 m) to develop a complete regional record from 1944 to
2005 (Fig. 1). In the overlapping period of record 1961–1991,
average annual precipitation at these stations ranged from 573
to 779 mm and average annual temperature was 11.1 8C at
Morella and 14.5 8C at Sant Mateu (Vallejo et al., 2001). Soils
were shallow and rocky, predominantly formed from limestone
and dolomite parent material.
The
old
P.
nigra
forest
covered
an
area
of
only
approximately 12 ha at the crest of the mountain (Fig. 2).
The surrounding environment included grass and shrublands,
planted trees (P. sylvestris), and bare rock. A wildﬁre in 2001
burned up the western slope below the study area, causing high
mortality in the lower forest stands but burning as a surface ﬁre
through the study sites. We selected three study sites of
approximately 3 ha each, located in the center of the three least
steep and most densely forested areas. The sites were grouped

Missing data were supplemented from three other regional weather stations,
creating a continuous regional record from 1944 to 2005. Tree-ring-width index
(solid line) was signiﬁcantly but weakly linked to precipitation.

by aspect: NE (average aspect 498), W (average aspect 2708),
and SW (average aspect 2268). Slopes averaged 49% at the NE
site, 51% at the W site, and 53% at the SW site.
We selected three stands and installed ﬁve variable-radius
plots on a grid in each stand, with four gridpoints forming a
square with 60-m sides and the ﬁfth point in the center. Stand
structure, species composition, and tree age were measured on
each plot using a 2.3 m2 ha1 BAF prism at each site to
reconstruct stand dynamics and the extent of stand-replacing
disturbances in the past. Tree measurements included species,
condition (living or snag), diameter at breast height (dbh),
height, crown base height, crown scorch, and bole char. Tree
regeneration (trees < 130 cm in height) and shrubs were
measured on a ﬁxed 0.00405 ha plot (3.6 m radius) at each
plot center. Forest ﬂoor depth (litter [Oi] and duff [Oe and Oa])
and woody debris (by diameter and decay classes) were
measured using a 15.24 m planar transect (Brown, 1974) in a
random direction from each plot center. Increment cores were
collected from the ﬁrst four trees (starting from north) on each
plot plus all trees with dbh  45 cm.
Each site was searched thoroughly for the ﬁre-scarred
trees with the apparently longest and most complete record of
ﬁre scars. Although many trees had large and old scarred
‘‘catfaces’’, the majority of these had been cut with axes at
some point in the past, perhaps to remove resinous wood for
kindling. The axe cuts were old, as evidenced by large healing
curls around wounds. Additional tree-tending actions were
observed in the form of cutting one of the two stems of the
majority of twinned trees on the sites. These cuts also appeared
to be old. We collected 10 partial cross-sections from ﬁre-
scarred trees at each site, for a total of 30 samples. Twenty-six
samples were collected from living trees, three from snags, and
one from a cut stump.
2.2. Laboratory methods
Aboveground tree biomass was calculated using allometric
equations in the Gotilwa+ model (Gracia et al., 1999). Biomass
of woody debris was calculated from the planar transect data
using the method of Brown (1974), which requires parameter
values of average length, diameter, and speciﬁc gravity of wood
particles of various sizes. These values have not been developed
for P. nigra, so we substituted the parameters for the North
American species Pinus ponderosa (Sackett, 1980), which has a
similar growth form and speciﬁc gravity: P. nigra, 0.36–0.39
(Amarasekara and Denne, 2002), P. ponderosa, 0.42 (Simpson
and TenWolde, 1999). The absolute values of woody debris
biomass are uncertain because of the substituted parameters,
but relative differences among sites should be reliable. We
compared forest structure at Sierra Turmell with data from the
Spanish national forest inventory for P. nigra across north-
eastern Spain (Catalunya) (Gracia et al., 2004). The forest
inventory data were collected only from trees with diame-
ter  7.5 cm, whereas our sampling methods included all trees
that reached breast height, so the comparison overestimates the
relative density and biomass of small-diameter trees at Sierra
Turmell. We calculated annual aboveground biomass increment
from radial increment data for Catalunya (Gracia et al., 2004)
and from measured ring-width data at Sierra Turmell. Carbon
content of P. nigra was calculated as an average of 51% of
biomass (Nicodemus and Williams, 2004).
Partial cross-sections and increment cores from ﬁre history
and tree age sampling were returned to the lab, sanded, and
crossdated (Stokes and Smiley, 1968) with a local P. nigra
chronology. The chronology consisted of 23 tree cores from 10
trees covering 213 years (1789–2001) with a series inter-
correlation of 0.655 and average sensitivity of 0.349. Tree rings
of the ﬁre-scarred samples were measured and dating accuracy
was checked with the Cofecha program (Holmes, 1983).
Twenty-seven of the 30 ﬁre-scarred samples were successfully
dated. The season of ﬁre occurrence was estimated based on the
relative position of ﬁre injuries within each annual ring (Baisan
and Swetnam, 1990). The relationship between climatic
ﬂuctuations and ﬁre occurrence was evaluated with superposed
epoch analysis (SEA), using software developed by Grissino-
Mayer (2001). The locally developed tree-ring chronology
served as a proxy for climate. In the SEA, the climate values in
all ﬁre years were averaged and compared to the average
climate values in a window of 5 preceding and 4 succeeding
years. Bootstrapped distributions of climate data in 1000
random windows were used to create conﬁdence intervals. Tree
age distributions were created by adding the complete sampling
of trees  45 cm to the systematic subsample (ﬁrst four live
trees per plot), corrected to represent the measured tree density.

3. Results
3.1. Forest structure
Trees were relatively large and old in the three study sites
(Table 1, Fig. 3). Ninety-nine percent of the trees encountered
on the plots were P. nigra. Mean forest density ranged from 483
(45) to 766 (480) trees ha1. The W site, with the highest
density, had a high number of small-diameter trees. Basal area
was lowest in the dense site W (19.3  2.7 m2 ha1), reﬂecting
the dominance of small-diameter trees, and higher in sites NE
and SW (27.1  4.1 m2 ha1 and 31.2  4.6 m2 ha1, respec-
tively). Multi-aged distributions were encountered at all three
sites. Two of the three sites had trees predating the 18th century
and the oldest tree encountered was 362 years old (center date
1642, site NE). Diameter and age were signiﬁcantly correlated
(r = 0.71, p < .001).

Heights of the measured trees averaged 9.5 m (1.1 m).
Height
was
signiﬁcantly
correlated
with
dbh
(r = 0.47,
p < .001). Crown base height averaged 4.0 m (0.15 m) and
was also signiﬁcantly correlated with total tree height (r = 0.56,
p < .001). However, although crown base height tended to
increase with tree diameter, variability was high and the
relationship was not signiﬁcant.
Tree regeneration consisted entirely of Quercus ilex shoots
at sites Wand SW, averaging 9603 stems ha1; all of the stems
were 30 cm tall. At site NE, we found no Q. ilex but an
average of 589 P. nigra stems ha1 and 295 Juniperus spp.
stems ha1. Two-thirds of the pines and junipers were well
established, taller than 30 cm. Regeneration was very patchy
throughout all three sites. Q. ilex was observed off-plots at site
NE and pine and juniper regeneration was observed at the
other sites.
Forest ﬂoors were shallow, with litter averaging 1.7 cm and
duff only 0.9 cm (Fig. 4). The estimated biomass of woody
debris varied moderately among sites, from a low of
1.9 Mg ha1 at site SW to a high of 2.8 Mg ha1 at site W.
Sound woody debris in the diameter class >7.62 cm was
encountered at only one site (W). No rotten woody debris was
encountered at all.
To describe the differences between the structure of the old
forest versus that of contemporary forests, we compared the
average diameter distribution and aboveground biomass at
Sierra Turmell with the averages for P. nigra in northeastern
Spain (Catalunya; Fig. 5). The northeastern Spanish forests
were dominated by smaller diameter trees, as opposed to the
larger trees at Sierra Turmell. The difference between the
forests became more exaggerated in the biomass comparison
because of the exponentially increasing contribution of larger

trees. On a per-hectare basis, the Sierra Turmell forest
supported over twice the basal area and over 2.5 times the
biomass of the northeastern Spanish forests (Table 1), with a
comparable advantage in terms of carbon storage. Above-
ground carbon sequestration, on the other hand, was over six
times higher in the younger northeastern Spanish forests. Trees
in the Sierra Turmell forest averaged almost three times older
and the oldest tree at Sierra Turmell, 362 years, was over a
century and a half older than the oldest P. nigra tree
encountered on any of the inventory plots in northeastern
Spain (Table 1).
3.2. Fire
Fire-scarred trees provided evidence of numerous surface
ﬁres in the past, but the practice of cutting into the catfaces with
axes obliterated many of the oldest records (Fig. 6). We
identiﬁed 11 scars as being deﬁnitely or most probably due to
axe cutting, based on observation of the tree in the ﬁeld and of
the sample in the lab. Cross-sections were artiﬁcially ﬂattened
by axe cutting, in contrast to natural healing curls observed after
ﬁre scarring. The conﬁrmed axe cut dates ranged from 1789 to
1904; the average date was 1868. An additional 4 scars were
considered possibly due to axe cutting; these dates ranged from
1851 to 1876, averaging 1866.
The oldest conﬁrmed ﬁre date was 1834, in site NE. An
additional ﬁve ﬁre dates were determined in the 19th century.
The 20th century ﬁre record was most complete, probably both
because less wood was lost to ﬁre or decay and because the
cutting practice ceased at the end of the 19th century. The ﬁrst
ﬁre date recorded on more than one sample was in 1938, with
scars on 5 of the 7 recording samples (those with open scars that
facilitate recording of ﬁres) in site W. In 1951, ﬁre was recorded
on one sample in each of sites W and SW. Fire in 1953 scarred
many more samples in these two sites, 11 of the 14 recording
samples. Fires in 1963 and 1981 were conﬁned to sites W and
SW, respectively. The Xert ﬁre of 2001 crossed all three sites,
scarring 16 of the 22 recording samples. The ﬁnal ﬁre, in 2003,
scarred only a single sample tree in site SW.
We did not calculate ﬁre frequency statistics such as the
mean ﬁre interval or ﬁre rotation because it was clear that a
substantial portion of the ﬁre record had been erased from the
catfaces by cutting. However, taking all three sites together,
there were 11 ﬁre dates in 172 years (1834–2005). In the 20th
century, 3, 7, and 6 ﬁre dates were recorded in sites NE, W, and
SW, respectively. The minimum interval between 20th century
ﬁre dates within any site was 2 years (sites W and SW); the
maximum was 57 years (site NE).
Fire and climate were not signiﬁcantly linked in superposed
epoch analysis (data not shown). The local tree-ring width
index, used as the proxy variable for climate, was weakly but
signiﬁcantly correlated with total precipitation in the region for
the overlapping period 1944–2001 (Fig. 1) (r = 0.17, p < .001).
The lack of linkage between ﬁre dates and precipitation was
conﬁrmed by inspecting the regional precipitation record
during the 8 ﬁres in the overlapping period. Regional
precipitation was below average in only half of the ﬁre years
and no ﬁres were recorded in the 15 driest years. Even fewer ﬁre
years (2 out of 8) were below average in summer (June–August)
precipitation.
Seasonality of scarring could be determined on 40% of the
ﬁre scars. Seventy-six percent were formed while tree-ring
growth was dormant, 7% in the early earlywood, 10% in the
middle earlywood, and 7% in the late earlywood.

4. Discussion
The relict forest at Sierra Turmell provides evidence of
multi-aged forest structure persisting through numerous surface
ﬁres over several centuries. It is not possible to generalize from
a single mountain to all the diverse environments where P. nigra
grew in the past. However, the relict forest had many attributes
that were consistent with a ﬁre-resistant evolutionary strategy
(Keeley and Zedler, 1998). Forest structure was relatively open
with large trees and high crown bases, reducing vulnerability to
crown ﬁre behavior. Shallow forest ﬂoors and low woody debris
loading, probably due to repeated ﬁres, were also conducive to
reduced ﬁre severity. Only one of the three sites was dominated
by small-diameter trees and even that site had a wide range of
large and old (300+ years) trees. The multi-aged stand structure
indicated that regeneration had been dominated by small-scale
events for at least 350 years, with mature overstory trees
surviving many surface ﬁres. There were no consistent
relationships between tree ages and ﬁre events. Regeneration
modes ranged over 100 years, from 1875 at site NE to 1975 at
site W (Fig. 3). Site SW had minimal tree establishment after
the early twentieth century, but the other two sites had
substantial numbers of trees that established after the wide-
spread ﬁres of the 1930s and 1950s. These patterns support the
hypothesis that repeated surface ﬁres tended to thin young trees,
but
not
eliminate
them.
Current
pine
regeneration
(trees < 1.3 m in height) was quite patchy and we encountered
no pine seedlings on the plots on two of the three sites, although
there were some seedlings nearby. However, the overall average
for pine regeneration was 196 P. nigra seedlings per hectare.
Assuming a lifespan of 300 years, a rudimentary demographic
analysis shows that maintaining the average forest density of
592 trees ha1 would require successful recruitment of only
19.7 trees ha1 decade1, suggesting that regeneration appears
to be adequate for sustaining the forest. The dense regeneration
of Quercus and additional regeneration of Juniperus, though
currently limited to short plants, indicate a capacity for these
species to expand if a stand-killing disturbance were to occur.
Fires recurred frequently on Sierra Turmell, even given our
minimal ability to detect the complete inventory of ﬁre dates
due to the cutting of catfaces. The overall ﬁre frequency of 11
ﬁre dates in 172 years was similar to ﬁre occurrence in Pinus
pinaster in Ma´laga, 13 ﬁre dates in 175 years (Vega-Hidalgo,
2000). Even at the smaller scale of the individual sites (3 ha),
the longest ﬁre-free interval was 57 years, still falling within the
range of the ‘‘predictable stand-thinning ﬁre’’ regime (Keeley
and Zedler, 1998).
The lack of linkage between ﬁre occurrence and climate
appears unusual, given the general relationship between
drought and area burned in the eastern Iberian Peninsula
(Pin˜ol et al., 1998; Pausas, 2004) and in many other regions of
the world. For example, ﬁre-climate analyses with similar
numbers of ﬁre dates and time periods in semi-arid pine forests
of southwestern North America showed strongly signiﬁcantly
dry conditions in ﬁre years (Swetnam and Baisan, 2003; Fule´
et al., 2005). A possible explanation for the difference could be
the variation between the climate patterns at the peak of Sierra
Turmell versus the climate of the relatively sheltered and
sometimes distant communities where the weather stations
were located. The fact that weather records were incomplete
and had to be pieced together from different stations also may
have introduced error.
Another possible explanation of the poor relationship
between drought and ﬁres could be the source of the ﬁres.
Fire regimes in southwestern North America were inﬂuenced
by people but there is substantial evidence that high lightning
incidence and dry windy weather may have accounted for the
great majority of past forest ﬁres (Allen, 2002). In contrast,
people have been considered the most important source of
ignition for Mediterranean ﬁre regimes (Grove and Rackham,
2001). Human-caused wildﬁres can be ignited by accident or as
arson, but Grove and Rackham (2001) argue that ‘‘occupa-
tional’’ burning to improve pasture for sheep and goats was
common throughout southern Europe. Frequent burning by
sheepherders was also suggested by Vega-Hidalgo (2000) to
explain the Ma´laga ﬁre history.
Occupational burning by pastoralists could be an explana-
tion for the pattern of burning during average or relatively wet
years at Sierra Turmell, if the burning practitioners intention-
ally selected less hazardous conditions for ﬁre. This hypothesis
would be consistent with the other cultural activities observed
on the site: cutting into catfaces and pruning of twinned stems.
These activities, which appear to have taken place in the 19th
century, seem to have been oriented toward conservation of
trees. Cutting into the catfaces had undesirable effects in terms
of our ability to reconstruct the ﬁre history, but the cutting was
relatively shallow and thus served as a way to harvest a useful
resource—resinous wood—without killing the trees. Pruning
twinned stems resulted in the retention of single-stemmed trees.
Although a botanist in the late 18th century commented on the
‘‘unaltered’’ isolation of the forest at the crest of Sierra Turmell
(Cavanilles, 1795), the development of terraced farmlands and
the evidence of cutting and perhaps human-caused burning in
the subsequent two centuries show that human inﬂuences had
increased.
How can information from the old forest ecosystem be
applied to modern management? We suggest two ways. First,
the contrast between the Sierra Turmell forest and the average
P. nigra forests of northeastern Spain shows important
differences in stand structure that have implications for genetic
variability, wildlife habitat, and many other forest attributes.
Here we focus on the carbon and ﬁre implications. Forest
plantations worldwide and in northeastern Spain serve to
sequester and store carbon, but this ecosystem service is of
limited value if ﬁre kills the trees and rapidly releases the
carbon (Battle et al., 2000; Houghton et al., 2000). The average
P. nigra forests are young, consisting mostly of planted trees, so
carbon sequestration is rapid. The average P. nigra forests are
dense with small trees, however, so the arrangement of fuels
ensures that there is a high loss of forest to severe wildﬁre
(Espelta et al., 2003). The remnant forest stores substantially
more biomass and carbon per hectare, and it has proven to be
resistant to several wildﬁres. To the extent that Mediterranean
forests contribute to European carbon balance, it may be useful
P.Z. Fule´ et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 255 (2008) 1234–1242
1240

to consider managing some P. nigra forests for larger and older
trees. Prescribed burning, perhaps following patterns of
frequency and seasonality developed by pastoralists, might
be useful for reducing the size and severity of wildﬁres (Pin˜ol
et al., 2005). Newer forests could mimic mature forests in their
structure and disturbance regimes, especially in the low density
of stands and the maintenance of traditional low-intensity ﬁres.
The Sierra Turmell data provide a living example of old
forest structure that has persisted for over 300 years. Relict sites
and reconstructions of historical conditions are valuable for
describing
reference
conditions
of
ecosystem
structure,
composition, and dynamics, providing guidance for ecological
restoration of degraded areas (Society for Ecological Restora-
tion 2002). In a broad sense, the 20th century reforestation of
Spain and other Mediterranean countries was intended to
restore the perceived beneﬁts of forest cover, including timber
production,
and
erosion
control
(Pausas
et
al.,
2004).
Unfortunately, the establishment of dense stands of ﬂammable
conifers may have had the unintended consequence of
increasing fuel hazards (Grove and Rackham, 2001); these
fuels appear to be particularly incompatible with warming
climate trends (Pin˜ol et al., 1998). Current approaches to
ecological restoration in the region are focused on more
sophisticated and realistic assessments of plant communities,
human needs, and future climates (Pausas et al., 2004; Vallejo
et al., 2006). In this context, the relict forest of Sierra Turmell
may offer useful guidance for practical and attainable goals
(Ehrenfeld, 2000) for restoring some sustainable P. nigra
forests resistant to severe wildﬁre.
