White Mountain Stewardship Project 
Final 10-year Socioeconomic Assessment
White Mountain Stewardship Project

The Ecological Restoration Institute 
 
Te Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University is a pioneer in researching, 
implementing, and monitoring ecological restoration of dry, frequent-ﬁre forests in the Intermountain 
West. Tese forests have been signiﬁcantly altered during the last century, with decreased ecological and 
recreational values, near-elimination of natural low-intensity ﬁre regimes, and greatly increased risk 
of large-scale ﬁres. Te ERI works with public agencies and other partners to restore these forests to a 
more ecologically healthy condition and trajectory—in the process, helping to signiﬁcantly reduce the 
threat of catastrophic wildﬁre and its eﬀects on human, animal, and plant communities.

Executive Summary
Te once-thriving east-central Arizona wood products industry came to a grinding halt in the early 1990s 
because of ongoing legal and social conﬂicts over federal forest management. In 2002, the largest ﬁre in Arizona’s 
history scorched a record number of acres in the area, burning many homes and infrastructure. Te growing 
wildﬁre threat and a decline in forest health shifted land management policy from gridlock toward collaboration 
in an eﬀort to restore the forests to more natural conditions. Under U.S. Forest Service leadership and with a 
newly formed partnership of the Natural Resources Working Group, one of the ﬁrst projects to attempt this was 
the White Mountain Stewardship Project (WMSP). 
Te White Mountain Stewardship Contract began on August 10, 2004 with a goal to treat 150,000 acres of 
degraded federal forests over 10 years. At the time, it was the largest and longest running stewardship contract in 
the country. Te project focused treatments in wildland-urban interface areas throughout the White Mountain 
region in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. Te WMSP was referred to as “the experiment” because no other 
national forest had attempted a large 10-year stewardship contract. For the ﬁrst time in this region, it brought 
together environmental groups, industry leaders, scientists, and community members to restore forest health through 
active forest management, protect communities, and re-tool and revitalize a local wood products industry. 
One of the project’s biggest hurdles was to develop a new, competitive marketplace for the harvesting and 
processing of small-diameter trees/biomass and to provide markets for low-value restoration by-products through 
a single contractor model. One of the project’s greatest achievements is that implementation occurred in the 
absence of legal challenges—acres were treated, and the treatments were successful in protecting communities 
during Arizona’s largest wildﬁre to date, the 2011 Wallow Fire (538,049 acres). Tis report examines the 
project’s 10-year lifespan through a socioeconomic lens and presents ﬁndings on the project’s impact to forest 
management, the forest product industry, and social and economic conditions in the White Mountain region. 
Some project challenges detailed in the report include:
•  Stewardship contracting barriers.
•  The single contractor model.
•  A limited supply of raw material.
•  The economic downturn of the Great Recession.
•  The Wallow Fire impacts. 
Many project successes are also captured, such as:
•  Revitalized forest products industry in the White Mountains.
•  Generational family businesses maintained.
•  Beneﬁts to forest health and ecosystem services.
•  Meaningful collaboration among U.S. Forest Service, stakeholders, and citizens.
•  Wildﬁre risk reduction and increased community protection.
•  Paved the way for the nation’s next largest collaborative restoration project, the Four Forest Restoration 
Initiative, or 4FRI.
U.S. Forest Service personnel, stakeholders, and business owners closely involved with the WMSP were 
interviewed for this report. Quotes and summarized information from interviews, combined with quantitative 
economic data, tell the story of how an industry, an agency, and a regional community shifted from stagnation 
to stewardship. Te report explores the economic challenges and opportunities faced by industry, and documents 
lessons learned that point to improvements to the stewardship-industry model. 
Executive Summary

Introduction
Te Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest (ASNF) is located in the White Mountains range, a transition zone, just 
south of the Colorado Plateau and north of the Arizona Basin (Netstate 2001). The White Mountains of Arizona 
encompasses more than two million acres of diverse vegetation and approximately one million acres of ponderosa 
pine and mixed conifer forests (USDA 2016). 
Te White Mountain region is deﬁned as a contiguous area anchored on the northwest by Snowﬂake-Taylor,  
on the east by Springerville-Eagar-Alpine, on the south by Whiteriver, and on the west by Heber-Overgaard  
(Fig. 1). Te White Mountains can be characterized as a rural area with small towns scattered throughout. Tese 
towns are far from urban centers, thus availability of resources, access to transportation and market distribution 
channels are limited.
Te White Mountain region lies within the world’s largest contiguous ponderosa pine forest, which suﬀers 
degraded forest health conditions from past management practices like over-grazing, logging, and ﬁre 
suppression. Beginning in the late 1800s, management practices disrupted the natural ﬁre regime of frequent, 
low-intensity surface ﬁres. Tese frequent (every 2–8 years) ﬁres historically cleared the forest ﬂoor of woody 
debris, prevented overcrowding of seedlings, reinvigorated forbs and grasses, and created suitable wildlife habitat. 
Without frequent surface ﬁres to control the growth of small, young trees, the forests in the White Mountains 
have become overcrowded and unhealthy. Te semi-arid and dry forests of the Southwest are further challenged 
by recent drought and climate change, which have stressed forests and increased their susceptibility to insect 
infestations and unnatural, severe wildﬁres.  
Te Rodeo-Chediski Fire ignited in 2002 and burned approximately half a million acres—this ﬁre was the 
largest wildﬁre ever recorded in Arizona. Te majority (59 percent) burned on the White Mountain Apache

Indian reservation, 2 percent on private land, and the remainder (39 percent) on the Apache-Sitgreaves and Tonto 
national forests (WFLC 2010). Te ecological and socioeconomic eﬀects of this ﬁre deeply aﬀected the White 
Mountain region. According to a study by the Western Forestry Leadership Coalition (2010), more than 490 
structures were destroyed and 30,000 residents were evacuated. Te total estimated costs of the Rodeo-Chediski 
ﬁre exceeded $308 million.

490 structures and 30,000 residents were evacuated. Photo courtesy of the USDA Forest Service
With forest health in decline and the eﬀects of the Rodeo-Chediski Fire, ASNF leadership understood  
the need to mitigate uncharacteristic, stand-replacing wildﬁres. To implement forest treatments and thin the 
excess small trees, leadership realized it needed to work with forest industry. Te ASNF submitted a proposal 
to the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) Regional Oﬃce (Region 3) to plan and administer a 10-year stewardship 
contract. In 2004, this was approved by the Regional Oﬃce, which initiated the White Mountain  
Stewardship Project (WMSP).
Tis study spans the 10 years of the WMSP and is presented as a socioeconomic assessment. Quantitative  
and qualitative analyses were conducted and are collectively presented in this report.

Methodology
Economic Analysis Area
Te White Mountain region includes parts of Navajo and Apache counties located in the eastern portion of 
the state. Tere is no census-designated metropolitan area in the region. Te largest city is Show Low, which 
is a census-designated micro-economic area. Te ASNF overlaps with the boundary of Greenlee County, but 
WMSP generated little economic activity in this county. Navajo and Apache counties include areas in the Native 
American tribal territories. Although the county economic proﬁles include economic data from the reservations, 
this data was not included in the WMSP economic region. Table 1 summarizes the latest demographic 
information available for the state of Arizona and the two counties.

Annual Economic Monitoring from 2005–2014
In a separate report, titled 2013–2014 White Mountain Stewardship Project Economic Assessment,1 we analyzed 
primary (2013 and 2014) and secondary data (2005–2012) in order to analyze long-term changes in economic 
activities of the WMSP. Findings were selected from this economic assessment to provide supplemental 
information for this report.  
Interviews with Businesses, U.S. Forest Service,  
and Stakeholders
A subsample of ﬁrms (n=11) was selected for an interview from a population of 24 related wood products 
enterprises that had worked in some capacity with the WMSP and completed an economic survey over the 
course of the ﬁrst eight years (2005–2012) (Appendix A). Ideal interview participants were those businesses most 
involved with the WMSP and had a substantial impact on the outcomes of the project. Businesses were selected

from this population by consulting with key informants and by screening potential interviewees on the telephone. 
Based on input, an additional business not included in this population was selected for an interview. 
Interviews were also conducted with stakeholders and USFS personnel. Stakeholders represented various non-
governmental organizations. Forest Service and stakeholder respondents were selected with key informant input 
as well as using snowball sampling methodology. Interviewees were asked to provide contact information of

USFS personnel (hereafter Forest staﬀ, collectively, or Forest staﬀ member) and stakeholders most involved  
with the WMSP. All potential respondents agreed to participate in the study.  
To solicit participation from selected businesses, an initial e-mail was sent explaining the study and requesting 
participation. In addition, a follow-up telephone call was made to secure their involvement and to answer any 
questions they may have about the study. For those businesses that qualiﬁed for an economic questionnaire 
(2013/2014), the survey was e-mailed to them ahead of time so the business owner could complete the 
questionnaire and submit it at the time of the interview.   
A total of 21 in-depth interviews were conducted with businesses (n=12), Forest staﬀ (n=5) and stakeholders (n=4) 
between December 2014 and April 2015. All business interviews were conducted in-person and most interviews 
with Forest staﬀ and stakeholders were telephone interviews. Interviews ranged from one to four hours with  
the average interview lasting 1.5 hours. All interviews were audio recorded and detailed notes were developed  
for the analysis.
Two interview protocols were developed. One interview guide was constructed for businesses and one for USFS 
and stakeholders (a subset of questions were designed for the USFS respondents only). Interviews were  
semi-structured. Te direction of the interview and the questions selected from the guides varied and were 
dependent on the background/knowledge of the respondent as well as answers from previous questions. Te 
interview guides were designed to lead the respondents through a chronological recollection of the project. 
Interviewees were asked to provide accounts that related to events before, during, and after the WMSP. Tis 
design assisted with sequentially and thematically organizing the data for analysis and presentation in this report.
Overview of Businesses (n=12) 
Interviews were conducted with 12 privately owned businesses located across the White Mountain region (see 
Fig. 2 for WMSP business locations). Businesses represented three subgroup categories: 1) sustained (established 
prior to the WMSP and operating) (n=8), 2) new and sustained (established during the WMSP and operating) 
(n=1), and 3) new and no longer operating (n=3). Respondents were primarily president/Chief Executive Oﬃcer 
(CEO) and owners of the businesses. Many business owners represented several generations in the timber 
industry and the number of years in business ranged from 10 to 62. Tese enterprises worked with the WMSP 
between one and 10 years with an average of six and a half years. 
Businesses interviewed were involved in: 1) harvesting operations (n=6); 2) small diameter mills and ﬁnished 
products (n=3) (pallets, cabin manufacturing products, dimensional lumber, and furniture parts); 3) manufactured 
ﬁnished products (n=2) (treated agriculture posts and poles and pellets); and 4) bio-power (n=1). 
Overview of USFS (n=5) 
Interviews were conducted with USFS line oﬃcers and staﬀ members who worked on the WMSP (n=5). Most 
of the personnel interviewed were veterans of the USFS and worked for the agency between nine and 44 years, 
averaging 28 years. USFS respondents worked on the WMSP between two and a half and 10 years, averaging 
ﬁve years. USFS respondents spanned the length of the contract—representing experiences throughout the 10 
years of the project. 

Overview of Stakeholders (n=4) 
Interviews were conducted with a variety of stakeholders (n=4) working with various conservation groups and 
professional organizations. Tose interviewed collaborated on the WMSP for the majority of its term, between 
eight and 10 years. Three of those interviewed were members of the WMSP Multi-Party Monitoring Board.
Findings
Forest Management and Forest Product Industry Conditions 
Prior to the White Mountain Stewardship Project
For 11 years prior to the WMSP, timber sales and forest harvesting were limited on the ASNF. Beginning in 
1993, when the Mexican spotted owl (MSO) was listed as a threatened species, legal challenges by interest groups 
reduced active forest management—limiting the raw material supply for the existing forest products industry 
(USFWS 2012). A business owner described the situation as “log wars” and that the forest was “shut down.” Raw 
material supply at the time was limited to the White Mountain Apache Indian reservation.
Due to lack of supply, mills began to close. Tere was a paper mill and power plant located in Snowﬂake, on the 
west side of the White Mountains. Te paper mill was also aﬀected by dwindling supply from federal lands and, 
in 1999, the mill was forced to convert to utilizing only recycled material, which further decreased the demand 
for raw wood ﬁber by-products.
Following the decline in logging on regional national forests in the mid-1990s, most forest industry and a 
trained workforce disappeared from the area. Te loss of industry and wood supply depressed the local economy. 
Although the wood supply from federal forests was uncertain, the few remaining ﬁrms adapted their business 
models to stay aﬂoat. For example, logging operators traveled long distances outside of the White Mountain 
region and worked on a variety of activities such as clearing orchards for housing developments in Phoenix, 
Arizona and slash procurement/chipping in New Mexico. Tese operators reported they did not return to work 
in the White Mountains until the WMSP began. Manufacturing ﬁrms that stayed in the White Mountains 
focused on various activities like log home construction and manufacturing molding and furniture parts. 
Adding to these trying times was the Rodeo-Chediski Fire. It deeply aﬀected the communities scattered 
throughout the White Mountains. Community members were frustrated by the perceived inaction of the ASNF 
prior to the ﬁre. Projects that were previously approved under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) 
and cleared for treatment (mechanical/hand tree thinning and prescribed burning) had not been treated because 
of protracted litigation that resulted in these areas burning in the ﬁre. Forest staﬀ stated that many residents 
believed if these forest treatments had occurred, the ﬁre might have been less severe and property and forest value 
losses might have been reduced. Te eﬀects of the Rodeo-Chediski Fire further depleted raw material supply 
from the ASNF and businesses found the only option on federal land was salvage logging in the burned area. 
Te results of this ﬁre prompted numerous communities to prepare Community Wildﬁre Protection Plans 
(CWPP). Te plans would assist with ﬁre risk mitigation strategies in their communities. Numerous grants from 
the Rural Conservation and Development, Four Corners Partnership, and USDA Rural Development assisted 
businesses in the region—these earlier grants allowed for initial investments in equipment that would not have 
been made due to the uncertainty of supply at the time.

Key Factors Leading to the White Mountain Stewardship Project
In 1997, multiple stakeholders and community members came together to build consensus on forest restoration 
issues, especially over concerns related to the recent listing of the MSO as a threatened species. Tis led to a diverse 
group of stakeholders forming the Natural Resources Working Group (NRWG) (Abrams and Burns 2007). 
To demonstrate a willingness to work together, the NRWG, in conjunction with the ASNF (hereafter Forest), 
designed the Blue Ridge Demonstration Project. This project demonstrated a variety of on-the-ground treatments 
to prompt discussions and provide an opportunity for various interest groups to share concerns. Tese treatments, 
collaboratively designed with scientists from Northern Arizona University’s (NAU) School of Forestry and the 
Ecological Restoration Institute, were foundational prescriptions for the WMSP. A Forest staﬀ member said the 
lack of industry to process small diameter wood products (i.e. paper mill) had a “chilling eﬀect” on attracting 
bidders for the project’s conventional timber sale. 
To assist with the lack of contractors bidding on the project, the Forest obtained funding to pay operators to 
implement a variety of experimental prescriptions. Forest staﬀ said this resulted in an embedded contract, which 
was a timber sale contract embedded in a service contract. Tis type of contract was the precursor to the White 
Mountain Stewardship Contract (WMSC). The Blue Ridge pilot project provided the needed experience in 
harvesting small diameter trees. It also provided the agency and the contractor an opportunity for trial and error 
and informed harvesting eﬃciencies once the WMSP began. Experience with this project provided the NRWG 
with information needed to begin to promote new approaches to forest management and contracts.
The Blue Ridge Demonstration Project also set the stage for new industry partnerships, including WB 
Contracting (harvesting operations) and Forest Energy (pellet mill). Together these businesses harvested mostly 
wood boles from trees less than 8.9 inches diameter at breast height (DBH) and processed the small diameter 
material into pellets. Tese businesses went on to form Future Forest, LLC, one of the bidders on the WMSC. 
Many businesses interviewed reported the Blue Ridge Project was a successful collaborative venture and 
believed this was key in bringing the WMSP to the Forest. At the table were the Forest, scientists, citizens, 
and environmental organizations like the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) and the White Mountain 
Conservation League. One business owner described these early relationships as “synergistic,” and that the early 
collaboration built needed trust between the groups, which in the past, was almost nonexistent.

One stakeholder said the Rodeo-Chediski Fire spurred the NRWG into action. After the ﬁre, some in the White 
Mountains communities pro-actively supported forest thinning, while others were against it. While the former 
position prevailed, it was clear there was a need to provide information to the public about the necessity and 
beneﬁts of forest treatments. A Forest staﬀ member described this transition as “[an] understanding within the 
community that changed from ‘logging is evil,’ to ‘logging is good.’”  
In 2002, President George W. Bush’s administration launched the Healthy Forests Restoration Initiative. It 
was designed to minimize barriers to active forest management with the goal of reducing the risk of unnatural 
crown ﬁres and restoring health to forests and rangelands (USDA 2016). Te primary goal of this initiative was 
to streamline NEPA environmental planning requirements and construct more robust and legally defensible 
analyses. Notably, this initiative encouraged the use of a new stewardship contracting authority (2003) that 
allowed the exchange of forest products for ecological restoration services. 
Te Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 provided legal authorities to: 1) expedite hazardous fuel reduction 
and forest restoration projects on federal land, 2) promote biomass removal and provide technical, educational, 
and ﬁnancial assistance for watersheds on non-federal lands, 3) authorize large-scale silvicultural research, 
4) authorize acquisition of Healthy Forests Reserves on private land to promote recovery of threatened and 
endangered species, improve biodiversity and carbon sequestration, and 5) direct the establishment of monitoring 
for insect or disease outbreaks (USDA 2016). Tis initiative and corresponding legislative components of the act 
contributed to the WMSP’s early momentum.  
Initiation of the White Mountain Stewardship Project  
and Changes in Forest Management, Business,  
and Economic Conditions 
In August 2004, the USFS Regional Oﬃce approved the ASNF proposal to initiate a 10-year stewardship 
contract. Te contract speciﬁed treatment of 150,000 acres of primarily small diameter ponderosa pine. Te 
management action emphasized reducing ﬁre risk in wildland urban interface (WUI) areas in the White 
Mountains. Tis was the ﬁrst long-term, 10-year stewardship contract in the nation (USDA 2003). Te project’s 
scope was at a scale that far exceeded past projects on the ASNF. Although a larger ﬁrm, Louisiana Paciﬁc, 
submitted a proposal through a group based in the eastern counties, Future Forest, LLC was selected as the sole 

11
contractor for the WMSP. A stakeholder said that the Louisiana Paciﬁc proposal included a sizeable oriented 
strand board (OSB) plant, but was too large and not appropriately scaled for the WMSP. He added that his 
organization was supportive of a smaller, local ﬁrm that would support community-based businesses. 
A secondary goal of the project was to develop industry that could utilize the small diameter wood. Te 
USFS realized industry was a necessary component for this project’s success. A Forest staﬀ member said, “Te 
Stewardship Project was a rather creative bold move by people inside and outside of the Forest Service to try to 
establish an industry that could pay for those treatments and the White Mountain Stewardship Project was a 
result of that.” A ﬁrm’s president said, “The White Mountain Stewardship Project came at a great time; it was 
a blessing.” Others said their business could not have returned to the industry if it were not for the WMSP, 
and that the project helped reestablish lost industry infrastructure. When the WMSP began, many businesses 
returned to the White Mountains for harvesting, milling, and producing a variety of ﬁnished products.
Changes in Harvesting and Milling Operations
Prior to the WMSP, and as businesses were adapting to the stewardship model, harvesting operators were 
transitioning from hand felling trees with chainsaws to mechanized harvesting operations. In addition, 
operations changed from harvesting primarily large diameter trees (equal to or greater than 12 inches DBH) 
to small diameter (5 inches to less than 12 inches DBH). To eﬃciently harvest small diameter trees, operators 
retrained crews and purchased new equipment, such as feller bunchers, in-woods chippers, and short log trucks. 
At the same time, loggers were learning new techniques to increase eﬃciency in their operations and reduce costs 
(e.g. directional felling of trees for eﬃcient skidding and directional placement on the landing for eﬃcient loading 
on trucks). Tis was also the case for biomass/slash (limbs, bark, other parts of the tree that were not traditionally 
utilized). In the past, slash was lopped and scattered and left for a separate crew to bulldoze the slash into piles 
for burning. As industry utilized the slash in the later years of the project, the contractor procured the slash 
during harvesting operations. For example, log skidders were used to move logs as well as procure slash and were 
continuously active with slash removal as the machinery moved across the site. Similarly, operations changed 
for existing mills. Milling operations and equipment adapted from processing large to small diameter logs. 
For example, the Reidhead Brothers Lumber Mill purchased a small diameter mill, which made a signiﬁcant 
contribution in processing small diameter logs from the WMSP.

Reestablishing Industry in the White Mountains 
During the ﬁrst two to three years of the project, it was diﬃcult to attract businesses to the White Mountains 
because ﬁrms that had past experience with unreliable supply from federal land did not trust the agency to 
follow through with the supply stipulations of the contract. A Forest staﬀ member said, “I would not have 
wanted to invest in a project with the Forest Service back then because our track record [to produce the material 
needed for industry] had not been that good for the last 10 years.” Te new businesses that did emerge lacked 
the institutional history as well as the background to meet all of the challenges presented by processing small 
diameter wood into value added products at a relatively large scale. 
Businesses at the time were challenged on many levels. The WMSP was a dramatic shift from past traditional 
timber sales. Businesses were reinventing their operations to harvest and process small diameter wood, using  
Some small-diameter trees were chipped on-site and 
delivered to Forest Energy Corporation, where it was 
processed into pellets for pellet-burning stoves.

new equipment while, at the same time, determining the best markets/niches to ﬁll with small diameter 
ponderosa pine products. While large diameter ponderosa pine can be processed into light structural framing 
products, the small diameter material removed was generally suitable for processing into non-structural products, 
such as pallet stock, molding, posts and poles, animal bedding, and mulch. 

13
Due to the challenges these businesses faced at the time, direct economic eﬀects of the WMSP were not 
realized immediately—there was a lag time (2 to 3 years) as established businesses were transitioning and as new 
businesses were being created. One business owner described this transition by saying that it took time to develop 
and expand the markets and amortize costs, but once his business developed a niche it shipped products across 
the western U.S. 
Economic Conditions During White Mountain Stewardship Project
About four years into the project, housing markets across the country began to crash and the global economy  
was in the early stages of what came to be known as the Great Recession, a period of economic decline in the late 
decade of the 21st century. Eﬀects from the Great Recession made transitioning to small diameter wood products 
(e.g. sill plates, garden mulch, molding, interior post/poles) diﬃcult, as they were tied to the housing industry. 
Te wood product industry was further challenged as the housing sector sank further into depression, with the 
downturn peaking in 2008/2009. One business, primarily involved in construction at the time, said his sales 
dropped by 70 percent. Businesses struggled to compete in the global market because it was diﬃcult to ﬁnd a 
competitive market niche. Despite the obstacles, businesses in the WMSP recognized the availability of the small 
diameter material and the potential to create products to match market demands.
Employment Trends 
While employment in businesses tied to the WMSP had ﬂuctuated, most ﬁrms interviewed reported modest 
increases in employment levels when they began to work on the project. Businesses that experienced a decrease in 
employment reported this occurred when they moved their operations from the White Mountain Apache Indian 
reservation to the WMSP. While working for the Fort Apache Timber Company, these enterprises reported 
their businesses were larger, had more consistent work, were more proﬁtable, and had more employees than when 
they operated on the WMSP (in 2008, the Fort Apache Timber Company closed for unrelated reasons). Logging 
operators reported that they required fewer employees because they gained operational eﬃciencies when they 
moved their operation over to the WMSP by: 1) acquiring new equipment, 2) assigning workers to speciﬁed 
skills/duties, and 3) leaving the biomass (the contractor, Future Forest, procured the biomass). A logging operator 
said eﬃciencies were gained to a point that a four-person crew could ﬁll eight to 10 truck-loads per day on the 
WMSP versus a 12-person crew on the reservation.
Tis is in line with the economic analyses of full-time equivalent (FTE) value (employment data is converted to 
a FTE to facilitate comparisons between ﬁrms) during the WMSP (Kim and Mottek Lucas 2015). In assessing 
the data, it is important to note the 2005 ﬁgure was inﬂated by a one-time reporting from a large business with 
200 employees, located in Phoenix, Arizona (outside the WMSP economic area). Terefore, considering ﬁgures 
from 2006 to 2011, FTE had less noticeable variations (small decreases and increases) and reached its highest 
point in 2010 (316.6 FTE, see “FTE Value”) (Table 2 and Fig. 3). In 2012, there was a dramatic decline in FTE 
(105.3). Te 2012 WMSP economic monitoring report noted that the 2011 Wallow Fire signiﬁcantly decreased 
the available supply from the WMSP, which most likely aﬀected enterprises that relied on this supply and were 
reﬂected in the subsequent decreased employment trends.

Grants and Financial and Technical Assistance
Once the contract was issued and additional federal and state grants and ﬁnancial assistance programs became 
available, businesses began to use the region’s small diameter wood and its byproducts. Te Forest Products 
Laboratory’s Forest Products Marketing Unit awarded Woody Biomass Utilization Grants, which helped to 
develop markets for small diameter wood. From 2005 through 2011, the program helped businesses oﬀset their 
startup costs by providing grants for equipment acquisition and technical assistance for an array of biomass uses. 
In total, ﬁrms in the White Mountains received $3.2 million, of which $2.6 million was actually spent and 
was matched by another $4.9 million of primarily in-kind contributions of grant recipients’ labor and services 
provided (Davis et al. 2014). Tree organizations with missions primarily focused on sustainable forests, wood 
utilization, and rural economic development provided intermediary assistance with the grant process. Te three 
groups included: 1) Northern Arizona Wood Products Association, 2) Little Colorado River Plateau Resource 
Conservation and Development, and 3) Small Business Development Center at Northland Pioneer College. 
Tese groups formed a team and provided technical assistance to potential grantees with proposal development 
and construction, ﬁnancial projections, administration, and grant reporting.
Listed below are other notable ﬁnancial and technical assistance contributions and grants that assisted with small 
diameter wood utilization during the WMSP.
1. Arizona Commerce Authority:  
a) Assisted with exports to Mexico. 
 
b) Healthy Forest Enterprise Incentives Program oﬀered diesel fuel tax reduction and a tax exemption for  
 
    equipment and parts (ACA 2015).
2. Te town of Eagar’s city manager assisted in promoting forest health initiatives, such as: 
a) Developed workshops that assisted the wood products industry with hiring employees, managing  
 
    budgets, developing business models, and acquiring ﬁnancing. 
 
b) Promoted the White Mountains’ forest products industry and developed new markets through tours  
 
    and various engagements.
 
c) Trough a grant from the Southwest Sustainable Forests Partnership, procured one of the ﬁrst chippers  
 
    in the White Mountains.
3. University of Arizona Cooperative Extension provided educational programs and staﬀ (i.e. a 
member of the Multi-Party Monitoring Board, the NRWG, USFS Interdisciplinary Team). 
Te WMSP presented many opportunities  
for businesses and the grants, along with other 
ﬁnancial and technical assistance, further 
incentivized businesses to explore prospects 
and/or expand their enterprises. Tese 
incentives leveraged signiﬁcant outcomes for 
the project like assistance with equipment 
acquisition to construct small diameter mills. Te incentives increased the capacity of individual business 
development and the project as a whole. A stakeholder said, “Without the stewardship contract as the foundation 
and without that grant money as the seed I don’t think the White Mountains situation would have been nearly as 
robust as it was.”

The Stewardship Contract Authority
White Mountain Stewardship Contract: Te Grand Experiment
Forest staﬀ coined the WMSC as “the experiment” because this was the ﬁrst long-term stewardship contract 
in the nation. Forest staﬀ explained there had been no precedent to follow and the agency took great risks to 
determine the length of the contract and the number of acres to treat. Initially, the treatment area of 150,000 
acres was derived from the number of acres in the WUI and the volume of wood ﬁber the USFS thought was 
needed to attract industry. Te agency also determined the full length (10 years) within the authority was 
necessary for industry to realize some return on their investments. 
Over the course of a year, the contract was developed based on past methods used in harvesting large timber,  
or saw logs. Mechanized harvesting equipment technologies and the process of thinning small diameter trees 
were novel and experimental at the time. As a result, the contractual requirements did not evolve to incorporate 
the new processes and eﬃciencies being developed as the WMSP progressed. For example, because biomass (e.g.  
tree limbs, bark, etc.) was utilized for the ﬁrst time, large slash piles were no longer constructed by a separate 
crew, rather slash was either piled while harvesting or disbursed for broadcast burning. Also, ﬂagging skid 
trails was no longer necessary because operators were not removing large trees from the site. Loggers said these 
outdated contractual requirements increased the time that it took to complete task orders. Tey believed the 
low market value of the small diameter wood should have lessened or omitted these contractual requirements. 
Operators also reported that the USFS tried to enforce out-of-date contractual requirements and, at times, 
instructions/procedures changed and/or were contradictory. Since these new practices and eﬃciencies arose after 
the contract was developed, the agency could not incorporate them. Flexibility in the contract was needed to 
consider these novel technologies and processes. Forest staﬀ said a distinct advantage of the contract was that  
it focused on the overall goals of the project, which was treating acres.

Performance Measure: Acres Versus Tons
Prior to the WMSC, when extracting large diameter trees was the focus, loggers were paid by measuring each 
stem in one thousand board feet (using a Scribner Decimal C formula). Te cost of sorting and measuring 
each stem was oﬀset by proceeds the agency received from timber sale receipts. However, this approach was 
unnecessary and inappropriate for assessing the removal of small diameter trees. Instead, the agency estimated 
the volume of the small diameter material from a sample of timber cruises extrapolated across the project area. 
Te volume (green tons) extracted then could be conﬁrmed by weighing the material. 
Initially, the relationship between acres and volume of small diameter material was not well understood. For 
example, the agency estimated 10.7 tons would be removed on each acre. About halfway through the project, 
beginning in 2008, industry began to remove and utilize forest byproducts (slash) from the western side of  
the ASNF. This was an acceptable hauling distance to the biomass power plant located in Snowﬂake. Based  
on tracking the acre-to-volume relationship during the WMSP, the 10.7 ton per acre ﬁgure increased to an 
average of 25.8 tons per acre. Te 25.8 tons of ﬁber removed included both saw logs and biomass. However, this 
average only included biomass extracted from a portion of the ASNF from 2008 to 2014. Forest staﬀ experiences 
revealed that the proportion of saw logs to biomass was two to one—two truck-loads of saw logs produced one 
truck-load of biomass.
When request for proposals (RFPs) were released, the contract stipulated the awardee would be paid on a per  
acre basis. Tree months after the contract was awarded, an amendment was devised stipulating the contractor  
would be paid on volume (green tonnage) rather than acres. According to Forest staﬀ, this decision was made to 
give the contractor an advantage and assist with the viability of industry. Since acres varied in density (volume) 
and tonnage was a concise measurement, being paid by the ton eliminated uncertainty and provided assurances  
to the contractor. When both the agency and industry were asked which was the best metric to gauge 
performance, responses varied. 
Several businesses believed treated acres was the ideal metric. However, to eﬀectively gauge this, one ﬁrm 
suggested longitudinally comparing the number of acres treated versus the resources and cost (both on the USFS 
and industry side) expended to treat these acres. For example, the following questions were recommended: “What 
was the costs to treat these acres?” and “Are operations gaining eﬃciencies and decreasing the costs as the project 
progresses?” Tis information would assist both entities in determining whether the eﬃciency in environmental 
planning, administration, site preparation and harvesting operations were improving or declining. If this trends 
toward treating a greater number of acres at a lower cost, this type of tracking and reporting could motivate 
congressional leaders to ramp up investment for forest restoration. 
Another ﬁrm believed there were advantages and disadvantages to both acres and tons that depended on 
whether you are the contractor or the consumer of raw material. Paying on green tonnage was to the contractor’s 
advantage. It incentivized the contractor to move the trees from the stump to the scale as quickly as possible 
because the operator was paid to move water. As a consumer of dirty chips, rather than using green tons, his ﬁrm 
preferred paying on bone dry tons (this ﬁgure is derived from weighing a sample of green chips as compared to 
the same sample dried and extrapolating the diﬀerence to the ton), which eliminated variation of the amounts  
of water that were in the trees/biomass when it was delivered. 
Forest staﬀ believed that gauging performance on a per acre basis was the best metric because it matched the 
agency’s targets. Te problem with using green tons/volume was the variability of volume on each acre. For 

18
example, some acres may have contained a small amount of volume, but they were strategically important to 
treat for ﬁre mitigation; therefore, paying on per acre basis would have motivated the contractor to do any acre, 
regardless of its stocking levels. Another Forest employee said that tracking both metrics (acres and tons) would 
assist the agency in better understanding this relationship.
Te agency’s decision to pay the contractor on tonnage did motivate the contractor to increase productivity 
on each acre. As the project matured and agreements between the agency and interest groups were reached, 
treatment intensity increased; thereby, more small trees and biomass/slash were removed from each acre. Forest 
staﬀ said that by 2013, treatments intensiﬁed to almost double the volume removed on the same number of acres. 
In line with employment (FTE) trends (Fig. 3, p. 13), acres treated and raw material removed dropped 
signiﬁcantly in 2009, correlating with the Great Recession. In 2010, the number of acres treated reached its 
highest point and began to decline in 2011. Volume removed peaked in both 2010 and 2011 and began to decline 
in 2012. Te increase in acreage in 2010 could be attributed to supplemental funding (American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act) the Forest received to increase the number of acres treated. Increased volume removed in 
2011/12 could be attributed to several factors: 1) increased biomass removed on each acre, and 2) agreements  
were reached between stakeholders and the Forest that allowed for adapted prescriptions to remove more volume 
on each acre. Both acres and tons experienced a dramatic decline for the ﬁnal three years of the project (Fig. 4). 
Tis decline could be linked to several factors like the 2011 Wallow Fire. 
Figure 4. Raw ﬁber (green tons) removed and approximate acres treated during the WMSP. 
Budgetary Constraints, Cost to the Federal Government, and Acres Treated
Stewardship Contract Authority essentially allows for the exchange of goods for services (USDA n.d., 
Stewardship Contracting Overview). In the case of the WMSP, the value of the small diameter wood (5 inches 
to less than 12 inches DBH) was less than the cost to thin the forest. However, some costs were oﬀset by a small 
portion of larger material (“stumpage” above 12 inches DBH) that was extracted. Since the majority of material 
harvested was small diameter of little value, the contractor was paid on a per acre basis (equated to volume) for 
the diﬀerence between the stumpage (paid to the USFS) and small diameter ﬁber (paid to Future Forest, LLC).
Year

19
Originally, the WMSP set out to treat 150,000 acres over 10 years. However, because of federal budget 
limitations, the ﬁnal commitment was to treat 5,000 acres annually. Since the contractor was paid on tonnage, 
according Forest staﬀ, the USFS developed a formula that equated acres to tons. Future Forest, LLC was paid 
$500 per acre, which was equivalent to 53,500 tons per 5,000 acres (10.7 tons per acre). Te increased material 
removed as the project progressed could be attributed to more aggressive prescriptions (more trees were removed 
on each acre) and procurement of slash. Although the amount of material removed increased, a good portion of 
this was biomass, which had the lowest value and increased transportation costs. In the end, the price paid to  
the contractor ($500 per acre) remained the same throughout the life of the contract. 
An annual budget of $5 million was equally distributed ($2.5 million each) to Future Forest, LLC and the 
agency. Te contractor used the funding to pay for thinning operations and the USFS used the funding for 
NEPA planning, contract administration, and site preparation. Tree percent of the budget was allocated to  
the Multi-Party Monitoring Board; a requirement of the authority. A Forest staﬀ member explained there had 
been a fundamental shift in budgeting and funding allocations within the Forest. Te Forest staﬀ member said, 
“It shifted how the money was used on the Forest and it created a commitment from the Regional Oﬃce to fund 
the White Mountain Stewardship Project.” However, subcontractors were not subsidized; they were paid by the 
green ton directly by the contractor, Future Forest, LLC. 
Te ASNF worked to raise the visibility of the project through working closely with the Washington Oﬃce and 
as a result it received two sources of supplemental funding: 1) unspent end-of-the-year funds from USFS units 
across the country; in turn, these Forests were able to meet their fuel reduction target obligations with on-the-
ground WMSP accomplishments (2004–2007); and 2) American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) 
funding, an economic stimulus incentive program promoted by President Barack Obama’s administration and 
authorized by Congress (2009–2010). In 2012, the harvesting operations were funded, but the Forest saw 
funding dwindle and these costs (mostly site prep costs at the time) had to come from internal program dollars. 
Although project funding was a notable and continuous struggle, these innovations enabled the agency to increase 
the 50,000-acre commitment to thinning approximately 70,000 acres, which was still less than half of the initial 
target. Many respondents believed the repercussions of the agency’s limited funding constrained industry and 
contractor capacity. Forest staﬀ speculated that if more acres had been treated (another 5,000 acres annually), 
industry capacity might have increased, allowing them to be more competitive. And in turn, increased capacity 
might have decreased the price the agency paid the contractor.  
Te contract required an evaluation every two years to determine if the amount paid by the federal government  
to the contractor matched original projections. Although there was variation in treatment costs on each acre, 
some were more expensive than others, costs averaged out across total acres treated. Te assessments over the life 
of the contract determined the cost per acre was on target with the original projection. As the project progressed, 
there was an expectation that the cost of thinning would decrease with increased operational eﬃciencies, but the 
cost of thinning ($500 per acre) remained the same throughout the project. Tis was partly due to the economic 
downturn and reduced demand for wood products that had a direct eﬀect on proﬁt margins. In addition, 
the subsidy assisted with high transportation and slash procurement costs. Forest staﬀ explained that the 
environmental planning costs decreased as the project progressed, but was challenged by the rate of inﬂation.

WMSP Facts:
Avoided Costs to the U.S. Forest Service and Public
Although the contract cost the federal government on average $500 per acre to thin primarily small diameter 
trees, several factors helped the agency and the public avoid costs: 
1. Beginning in 2008, industry removed and utilized forest byproducts. The need to pile burn in some areas was 
reduced (pile burning cost the agency an average of $75 per acre during the latter half of the project). Agency 
costs to burn piles in some areas in the forest was reduced. 
2. Forest treatments prior to the Wallow Fire (2011) reduced losses in infrastructure and overall forest health 
that was beneﬁcial to both the agency and the communities in the White Mountains. According to a fuel 
treatment eﬀectiveness assessment conducted by the USFS (2011), WMSP fuel treatments saved all but 
one of the structures in Alpine and helped ﬁreﬁghters safely contain the ﬁre. A study by Waltz et al. (2014) 
revealed ﬁre eﬀects were dramatically diﬀerent in treated versus untreated sites and identiﬁed four key 
ﬁndings: 1) ﬁre severity was noticeably lower in treated stands—on average, tree mortality in untreated areas 
was six times greater than in treated units; 2) treated stands retained a greater number of large trees than 
untreated units; 3) treated areas contained higher cover of native grasses than in untreated sites; and  
4) untreated units comprised larger patch sizes with high-severity ﬁre eﬀects than that of treated areas. 
Increased Eﬃciencies in U.S. Forest Service Processes
Troughout the project, the agency was able to increase eﬃciency and reduce costs in several ways: 
1. Environmental analyses were streamlined because they contained a larger number of acres than had been 
previously analyzed by the Forest and were not legally challenged by interest groups. 
2. Harvesting small diameter trees with low value did not require direct measurement and accountability 
as it had in the past when high valued timber was harvested from the forest—this eliminated the need to 
inventory every tree, instead volume was estimated. 
3. As the project progressed, marking every tree for harvest was eliminated with “designation by description” 

21
(DxD) in which, the prescription (the on-the-ground plan for thinning) was implemented as described by  
the Forest’s silviculturist.  
4. Administering a single, large contract to a sole contractor was less time consuming and complicated than 
overseeing multiple contracts and contractors.
If it is assumed that increased eﬃciency realized by the agency was attributable to increased economy of scale, 
this implies that as the size of production increased, the cost advantage per unit also increased. Total WMSP 
treatment cost consisted of ﬁxed (e.g. USFS administration, environmental analyses, etc.) and variable (e.g. 
Future Forest, LLC logging operations) components. As the WMSP’s scope increased (e.g. acres treated), ﬁxed 
cost per unit (e.g. planning cost per acre) decreased. Although the costs incurred by the USFS during the WMSP 
were mostly ﬁxed, they were spread over 10 years and administered by multiple branches within the agency. Te 
distribution of the costs over time among diﬀerent branches in the agency also varied. Further, costs to the USFS 
were dependent on how much planning, site preparation, and monitoring were completed by agency personnel 
versus outside contractors. All of these factors made it diﬃcult to estimate the expenses on a per acre basis and 
to quantify the cost advantage gained over time. However, interview results conﬁrmed that by undertaking 
treatments that contained a larger number of acres, the agency increased eﬃciency (i.e. increased economy of 
scale) and it promoted a substantial cost savings for the USFS. 
A USFS line oﬃcer explained transformations within the agency were a departure from past policies and 
procedures and increased eﬃciencies allowed the ASNF to slowly gain ground. Te line oﬃcer said that prior  
to the WMSP, the agency was inundated with lawsuits that created an environment of complacency within  
the USFS. Additionally, there was pushback at the Regional and Washington Oﬃce levels because of public 
concerns over perceived “corruption” of “loggers’ choice,” where in the past loggers selected the most valuable 
trees to harvest. 
Te USFS line oﬃcer said, “It was really hard to turn our organization into a production organization again 
after all those years of complacency.” Tey added that the Forest had to ﬁnd the right people to work on the 
stewardship project, particularly those who had “a ﬁre in their belly.” Te line oﬃcer said that maintaining the 
status quo within the agency was more in line with career security than taking risks that were not formally 
recognized by the agency as an accomplishment. Tis was reported as one of the agency’s greatest challenges.  
Te line oﬃcer said it was a diﬃcult transition and a complete paradigm shift in goals and objectives for federal 
land management projects. However, once these processes were in place, they cumulatively and markedly 
increased eﬃciency and reduced agency costs.
Paradigm Shift in Forest Management: Focus on Forest Structure 
For much of its existence, the USFS was an agency focused on what was being extracted from the forest and 
the high valued products that could be manufactured from the raw material. Once the WMSP began and low 
value small diameter logs and biomass were being removed, the emphasis shifted to the residual forest structure. 
Te USFS worked with ecologists from the School of Forestry and the Ecological Restoration Institute at 
NAU to determine the characteristics of a sustainable, ﬁre resilient forested ecosystem. Tis paved the way 
for a new paradigm of forest management, one with an emphasis on the retention of larger, ﬁre resistant trees 
and the removal of excessive smaller trees that acted as ladder fuels. According to Forest staﬀ, this shift was 
supported by industry. One USFS employee said it was the ﬁrst time they witnessed the utilization of the entire 
tree. Ultimately, the Wallow Fire became an opportunity to test theories about the eﬀectiveness of restoration 
treatments on ﬁre behavior and ecosystem resiliency.

Barriers and Challenges to Stewardship Contracting
Respondents identiﬁed several contractual barriers and challenges: 
1. Prevailing wage:2 Davis Bacon Act wages, known as “prevailing wage,” was a mandatory contractual 
requirement for in-the-woods operators and was identiﬁed by loggers as one of the greatest barriers these 
businesses faced. Loggers said this requirement was especially burdensome and had a profound eﬀect on their 
bottom lines. In their opinion, the prevailing wages required under the contract were much higher (15 to 
20 percent) than the going industry rates in the White Mountains at the time. Logging operators reported, 
the prevailing wage rate was $24 per hour, and they believed the required rates were approximately $4 more 
per hour than what operators not under the requirements of the contract were being paid in the region. As a 
comparison, Bureau of Labor Statistics’ data revealed median hourly wage of “farming, ﬁshing, and forestry 
occupations” in Arizona as of May 2014 was $8.90 per hour and “ﬁrst-line supervisors” of these occupations’ 
hourly wage was $20.76.3 
To further the prevailing wage discrepancy, a business owner explained, operators that required the highest 
skill level (e.g. a feller who operated a hot saw required this operator to cut accurately and quickly) were paid the 
same as those operators who required less expertise (e.g. a loader who mechanically placed logs onto a log truck).
Similarly, the experience of the equipment operator was not a consideration under this pay scale. Within the 
prevailing wage requirement, a “journeyman” who is an experienced equipment operator, received the same 
wages as an “apprentice” operating the same piece of equipment, but is being trained for the job. According  
to logging operators, paying the same wages to those in training who are less productive as those with years 
of experience not only aﬀected their proﬁt margins, but also negatively aﬀected employee morale. 
2. Costs to the contractor/subcontractor: Subcontractors shared that, considering how the contract was 
written, “Te economics [did] not pan out.” If the USFS wants more acres thinned, many operators believed 
the agency needed to understand the harvesting operational costs involved and match the contractual 
requirements to these expenses. As stated earlier in the report, outdated contractual requirements (e.g. 
ﬂagging skid trails) increased costs to the loggers. Tis was conﬁrmed by Forest personnel who said the 
contract was “overregulated,” which increased operational costs.  
3. Cancellation ceiling: Under the stewardship contracting authority, the USFS is required to set aside 
funds to cover contract cancellations (“default”); therefore, if a contract is cancelled, this assures the capital 
investments made by the contractor to fulﬁll the contract’s requirements are covered (Moseley and Davis 
2010). Te WMSP was no exception. According to operators and Forest staﬀ, this obligation is detrimental 
to the stewardship contracting authority because with such a sizeable, costly contract,4 this tied up a large 
sum of money that could otherwise be used for on-the-ground stewardship work.
4. Length of contract: From industry’s perspective, business investments of millions of dollars will not occur 
on a 10-year contract. Most businesses believed with the onset of small diameter wood utilization, this 
was too short of a timeframe to have amortized investments, increased eﬃciencies, and developed markets. 
Although most enterprises believed a longer term contract with a certain guaranteed supply of raw material 
was needed, the 10-year timeframe did assist businesses with obtaining ﬁnancing and these ﬁrms were able  
to realize some return on their investments.  
5. Subcontracted loggers hired by Future Forest, LLC did not have a written contract: In the absence 
of a formal, written contract, subcontractors found it diﬃcult to obtain ﬁnancing for capital investments like 
equipment purchases.
2 “Davis-Bacon Act and Related Act contractors and subcontractors must pay their laborers and mechanics employed under the 
contract no less than the locally prevailing wages and fringe beneﬁts for corresponding work on similar projects in the area. 
The Davis-Bacon Act directs the Department of Labor to determine such locally prevailing wage rates” (USDL).

4 $5 million per year; however, this amount decreased incrementally as the contract progressed.

6. Contracting at the Regional Oﬃce level: Te Contracting Oﬃcer’s Representative, or COR, was housed 
at the Regional Oﬃce in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Te COR oversaw in-the-woods operations and this 
created “animosity” between the Region and the Forest—most of the CORs lacked a timber sale contracting 
background and had minimal knowledge of on-the-ground operations that were occurring in the White 
Mountains in Arizona. Tese issues were conﬁrmed by many of the loggers who said most staﬀ holding this 
position did not have the experience needed to understand the complexities of the novel harvesting operations 
occurring on WMSP sites. Tey added that the COR did not take the time to visit the sites to understand 
and observe mechanized harvesting operations. Terefore, the COR did not realize the disconnect between 
the contractual speciﬁcations and the new technologies/operational eﬃciencies gained by the loggers. Tese 
inconsistencies were compounded by high turnover rates. 
U.S. Forest Service Processes Used for the Stewardship Contract
Generally, operators reported the agency’s administration and site preparation was timely and adequate. Te 
agency hired outside contractors to increase their capacity to mark trees for harvesting. Once Future Forest, 
LLC established trust with various interest groups, the agency gained the social license needed to implement 
prescriptions through designation by description (DxD), which eliminated marking trees. Tis was a signiﬁcant 
step to implement forest treatments more eﬃciently. 
From the Forest’s perspective, their greatest constraint was funding, which aﬀected their capacity to complete 
environmental planning and site preparation. In anticipation of budgetary constraints, the Forest strategized  
by completing “out-year” NEPA planning—knowing that NEPA takes a minimum of two years to complete,  
the Forest made sure NEPA-ready acres, known as shelf stock, was completed so the contractor was not delayed.  
However, funding limitations did not eﬀect on-the-ground administration; the Forest provided adequate staﬀ 
to administer released task orders. Te Forest was ﬂexible in administering task orders to meet the contractor’s 
needs. Forest staﬀ explained this had not been the case in the past. For example, multiple task orders were 
available so the contractor could move from site to site to acquire the raw material to ﬁll current market demands. 
Once task orders were complete, the Forest conducted implementation monitoring to ensure the contractor 
followed the prescription. 
Ecological Outcomes
Generally, both the agency and industry believed the resulting forest treatments achieved the main objective, 
which was ﬁre risk reduction in the WUI. In addition, they said these treatments also provided ecological 
beneﬁts, such as increased diversity of wildﬂowers and grasses and improved wildlife habitat. Business owners 
said it “surpassed” their expectations. One business owner said, “I would give high marks for the thinning they 
did on the ground in the White Mountains.” Ecological monitoring conducted by the Ecological Restoration 
Institute (2010–2014) conﬁrmed these observations and found treatments reduced predicted ﬁre behavior (see  
pg. 36 for more information on ecological monitoring data). 
As expected, treatments evolved as the project progressed. Initially, treatments were not thinned aggressively 
enough and residual stands were evenly spaced and uniform, known as jail bar treatments. Tese early treatment 
prescriptions were partially inﬂuenced by public opinion, and many believed if the public had been well informed 
and supportive at the time, the treatments would have evolved faster. An industry leader said, “We took baby 
steps to get to big steps.” In his opinion, the public had to see treatments in the ﬁeld, with small changes 
occurring over time before they were comfortable with more aggressive treatments. “It’s critical to have public 

24
support,” he said. Another business owner said, “At ﬁrst, the public was skeptical, but as they saw the progress/
motion, there was total buy-in.” 
Past practices (e.g. high-grade logging) and the resulting distrust of the USFS caused CBD to petition for a 16-
inch diameter cap. The Forest and CBD verbally agreed to consider and discuss a 16-inch diameter cap on  
a project-by-project basis. Tey scheduled site visits and conducted necessary discussions/agreements. Tis assured 
the environmental groups that large trees were not the priority for harvesting. However, Forest staﬀ believed 
the diameter cap left an excessive amount of trees in some areas. In their opinion, this deterred the project from 
meeting the primary objective of fuels reduction and restoring the forest to resemble natural conditions. Te staﬀ 
member said that as the goals of the public became more ambitious, the NEPA planning documents became 
more complicated, time consuming, and costly. 
A stakeholder said a demonstration project during the early years of the WMSP known as Eagar South 
integrated ﬁre risk reduction with multiple resource objectives (e.g. forest restoration principles and northern 
goshawk management guidelines). Trees greater than 16 inches DBH were cut and forest structure resembled 
historical conditions with clumps and groups of trees. Based on the Forest’s ﬁre modeling using a broad set of 
treatments, Eagar South was the only treatment area that revealed statistically signiﬁcant changes in predicted 
ﬁre behavior. Lessons learned on the Eagar South Project demonstrated that multiple resource objectives, 
including ﬁre mitigation, could be achieved.

As time went on, the public, stakeholders, scientists, and the agency agreed to adaptively manage treatments that 
thinned a greater number of trees and to mimic historic conditions with openings and arranging residual forest 
stand structure with clumps and groups of trees. “Tis was not full-blown systematic adaptive management that 
we idealize,” said a stakeholder, “but it was practical adaptive management that was aﬀorded by the multi-party 
monitoring eﬀort.” 
Te stakeholder added that because the project’s objectives focused on fuel reduction in the WUI, a broader 
application of forest restoration principles were not realized. With the focus on a relatively small footprint of 

25
the WUI and ponderosa pine, he continued, many questions, such as eﬀects to wildlife (e.g. MSO and northern 
goshawk) and mixed conifer, remained. 
Although the majority of those interviewed believed ecological beneﬁts were met, most thought more acres 
should have been thinned to further reduce ﬁre risk. In addition, reentry thinning would likely need to occur in 
15 years to maintain ﬁre risk reduction and forest health. Tese considerations are especially critical when climate 
change eﬀects are factored in—ongoing drought and higher temperatures are predicted to increase the likelihood 
of large crown-replacing wildﬁres and insect infestations (Westerling et al. 2006). Forest staﬀ agreed and 
supported a more aggressive agency position by doubling or tripling the harvested acres. According to the Forest 
staﬀ member, approximately 70,000 acres were treated, which is only about 7 percent of the one million acres of 
ponderosa pine forests on the ASNF. 
Direct Business Effects 
Innovations, Opportunities, Successes of  the White Mountain Stewardship Project Firms
Guaranteed Supply
Te most distinct advantage of the WMSP was the guaranteed supply of raw material. Te WMSC provided 
needed assurances for businesses to grow and take risks. Tey were able to invest in infrastructure and develop 
new products and markets for small diameter wood. Tis guaranteed supply helped businesses secure ﬁnancing. 
Without the contract, banks and other lenders would have been less likely to back the new business investments. 
According to one business owner, “Te essence of a steward is that guaranteed wood is the right model in order 
to assure that private industry that has made multi-million dollar investments and bets can be assured that their 
wood will be there for use in their industry.” Moreover, with assurance of supply, businesses were able to focus on 
growth and development versus obtaining the raw material they needed to survive. According to a business leader, 
“[Before the WMSP], we worked harder trying to be in business than working at business.” This also provided 
assurances to the employees of these enterprises, which reduced turnover and the need to retrain the workforce.   
Business Innovations and Eﬃciencies 
Te experience the WMSP provided to businesses faced with 
processing small diameter material was invaluable to their future 
business models. Tis aﬀorded these enterprises the opportunity 
to experiment with and learn new technologies and “retool” 
equipment. Producers of ﬁnished products reported signiﬁcant 
growth by adapting to commodities that were not tied to the 
depressed housing industry (e.g. treated agriculture posts and 
wood pellets). Te mix of businesses evolved “organically,” a 
stakeholder explained. He said, “Te dramatic change was they went from very little infrastructure and very 
little capacity to get work done, particularly in an organized manner, to having a well-honed tool that was shaped 
perfectly for the job.” Tis provided an unprecedented opportunity to harvest and process small diameter material at 
a relatively large scale. Once the WMSP was established, most ﬁrms reported increases in their proﬁtability, while a 
few said it stayed about the same or reported unproﬁtable years.
As the project progressed, industry created eﬃciencies in harvesting, processing, and developing added-value 
...  they went from very little 
infrastructure and very little 
capacity to get work done, 
particularly in an organized 
manner, to having a well-
honed tool that was shaped

products. For example, logging operations developed processes to more eﬃciently procure slash as they harvested 
and moved material. Other operators reported they acquired and used new equipment more eﬃciently and 
assigned workers specialized tasks. A ﬁnished goods manufacturer explained that his ﬁrm developed eﬃciencies 
in production by redesigning peelers and adding chip bins to collect waste.

Te Single Contractor System 
Advantages of Single Contractor (Future Forest, LLC)
Future Forest, LLC was the sole contractor that oversaw the project. Tis presented the following distinct advantages:
1. Te sole contractor acted as a broker of the raw material. Tey sorted it and distributed it to producers of 
ﬁnished goods, allowing for an eﬃcient, regulated ﬂow of raw material. One stakeholder said, “Tere was 
stability introduced into the system … that kept the wood ﬂowing at a relatively steady pace” and made 
it possible for businesses to compete. Tis provided eﬃciency in directing the type of raw material to the 
appropriate processing facility. For example, saw timber was delivered to the Reidhead Brothers’ sawmill for 
pallet stock, clean chips were transported to Forest Energy for pellets, and dirty chips were trucked to Novo 
BioPower for energy.
2. Many loggers, subcontracted by Future Forest, LLC, felt secure in the process because they could count 
on being paid on time. “[Being paid on time] was a real plus,” said one logging operator. Another said it 
“was a huge beneﬁt.” Operators explained that this was especially important in maintaining adequate cash 
ﬂow with such slim proﬁt margins. Tis model streamlined the process by allowing eﬃcient transfer of 
funds whereby Future Forest, LLC paid the logging subcontractors, and the mills and other ﬁnished good 
producers paid the contractor for the raw material. 
3. Future Forest, LLC provided credit terms to some of the ﬁnished producers. Tis allowed enterprises time 
to manufacture and sell the ﬁnished products, which assisted businesses with positive cash ﬂow.
4. Te single contractor eliminated the competitive bidding process, which can cause “bidding wars,” on  
timber sales for the logging operators. In essence, it prevented the larger companies with more capital  
from outcompeting smaller ﬁrms for the raw material. 
5. Te contractor committed resources to assist the development and reestablishment of the forest products 
industry in the White Mountains.
Agency processes and procedures that can be restrictive, time consuming and costly were alleviated with Future 
Forest, LLC overseeing the contract.

Varying Perspectives of the Single Contractor System
Business Perspective: Disadvantages to the Single Contractor Model
Future Forest, LLC was paid on average $500 per acre to remove trees from the forest. Tey controlled  
the timber supply, price, and distribution of raw material to various businesses in the White Mountains. Firms 
believed fostering competition was necessary for an open competitive market system to work. Given that the 
contractor lacked competition, the majority of those buying 
the raw material from Future Forest, LLC described their 
level of control over the market as a “monopoly.” Businesses 
believed the market should determine the price, not  
the contractor. 
Business owners explained that initially this was not a 
signiﬁcant problem because there was ample supply. But 
as the project reached the halfway point and supply began 
to dwindle, it became a critical issue. As enterprises built 
demand for their products, raw material was harder to obtain and costs increased. A business owner said he was 
unable to negotiate costs. He said, “it’s either I buy it or I don’t.” Another said, “[Te contractor] controlled your 
money and livelihood.” He continued to explain that although the contractor was subsidized and likely increased 
eﬃciency in their operations, the price of the raw material never decreased. Instead, the price increased as the 
project progressed. One business leader said, “In the beginning we were all working together to develop small 
diameter value, and then as it progressed, the [steward] became our competitor rather than our supplier.”
Businesses assumed the contractor’s price was inﬂated because if a company refused to buy the material at the 
asking price, the contractor hauled the wood/biomass twice the distance. Additionally, many business owners 
supposed if they were not part of the contractor’s “inner circle,” they may have been excluded from receiving 
material altogether. Or, they may have been charged higher prices for comparable or lower grade material—
these perceptions were shared among most of the ﬁrms interviewed, whether they were loggers, millers, or 
manufacturers. Te contractor was described as “manipulative” and refused to work with logging operators 
who would not meet demands like leaving the byproducts (slash) for the contractor to remove. Tis created a 
hostile, competitive, non-collaborative business environment within the region and “defeat[ed] the concept of 
stewardship,” a business owner said. 
Te supply and pricing limitations defeated the forest cluster industry model, which deterred business growth,  
the creation of higher value-added products, and the cooperative spirit a burgeoning forest product industry 
needed to survive. Businesses agreed that without these challenges, more acres could have been treated and the 
cost per acre would have been reduced because increased proﬁt margins would allow enterprises to pay higher 
prices for the raw material. 
Forest Staﬀ and Stakeholder Perspectives: Advantages to the Single Contractor Model
Although most ﬁrms believed improvements could be made with a sole contractor model, a Forest staﬀ 
member held a diﬀerent point of view. Forest staﬀ explained that Future Forest, LLC was thinking long-term 
by attempting to estimate future costs of the raw material. Tat, in theory, when the subsidy ended, the price 
enterprises were paying were in line with current economic conditions (factored in inﬂation). Moreover, Forest 
staﬀ pointed out, Future Forest, LLC provided credit terms to many of these businesses and it was reported  
that some of these ﬁrms were late paying their loans back. If this was the case, the contractor did not provide

28
them raw material until the balance was paid oﬀ. In the end, the recession was a major factor in deterring the 
project’s progress and, Forest staﬀ believed, this caused Future Forest, LLC to be blamed as a “scapegoat” by 
some enterprises. 
One stakeholder interviewed supported the single contractor model and said that if the Forest had alternatively 
administered several small timber sale contracts in a competitive bid process, it might have negatively aﬀected the 
success rate of the project as well as business stability. A Forest staﬀ member agreed and said that when the Forest 
released and awarded 20 smaller salvage logging timber sale contracts after the Wallow Fire, approximately 40 
percent of the awarded contracts were terminated for a variety of reasons (e.g. contractor could not complete  
and/or lacked the funds).
In the end, although ﬁrms had grievances with the sole contractor system, most believed the WMSP successfully 
restored forest health in the treated areas, reduced the risk of unnatural severe wildﬁres, and helped to reestablish 
and revitalize the forest products industry, the economy, and communities in the White Mountains.

Overall Impact to the Forest Products Industry 
Types of Products and Industry: Forest Industry Cluster Model
Products Produced
Four types of materials were provided through the WMSP: 1) dirty chips (including bark), 2) clean chips 
(excluding bark), 3) round wood (5 to 9 inches DBH), and 4) saw timber (greater than 9 inches DBH). Since  
the project focused on harvesting primarily small diameter trees and removing and using biomass, saw timber  
was a smaller portion of total production than in the past and biomass utilization (dirty chips) was completely 
novel. A logging operator said that on average his operators extracted half a truck-load of logs to a load and a 
quarter of biomass. Forest staﬀ reported similarly a two-to-one ratio of saw logs to biomass. Over the course of 
the project, more than 24 small forest products ﬁrms were involved in harvesting and processing these materials.
To produce a marketable ﬁnished product for small diameter ponderosa pine, mill operators produced green 
pallet stock (not kiln dried), also known as “rough-cut green timber.” Operators called this a “sweet spot” because 
they were able to realize an adequate proﬁt margin. One mill operator said that if the markets were better at the 
time, producing full-service, ﬁnished products that were dried, planed, and graded, such as dimensional lumber, 

29
could have increased proﬁt margins. However, considering the lack of kilns to dry the lumber, coupled with the 
depressed economic conditions and housing market, producing green pallet stock was the best solution at the time. 
Te majority of pallet stock produced were exported to Mexico, which was dependent on ﬂuctuations in the exchange 
rate and could limit exports if the rate was unfavorable. The Vaagen Brothers Lumber mill, a high-speed small diameter 
mill, was an exception. It primarily produced square cants (4x4, 6x6, 8x8), also exporting these products to Mexico. 
Energy products, such as pellets for heating structures and bio-power, utilized clean and dirty chips. Other products 
manufactured included: mulch, livestock bedding, pressure-treated agriculture posts and poles, cabin manufacturing 
products, siding, molding, decking, and furniture parts.

A treatment plant that arose from the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant program developed an innovative method 
for treating posts and poles for outdoor uses like vineyard posts and fencing. One of the goals of this product line was 
to produce ponderosa pine round guardrail posts for highways in Arizona. Te ponderosa pine round guardrail post 
underwent testing by the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) to determine whether this species could be 
used as a surrogate for the standard 6x8 square posts made most commonly of Douglas ﬁr and southern yellow pine. 
Since ADOT increased the soil compaction requirements, the test resulted in producing a minimum 8¾ inch (+ or – 
½ inch) diameter round post, which was one inch greater (7¾ inch) than what is most cost eﬀective to produce. 
Te business owner said that while there was ample material in the forest to manufacture the posts, they did not 
receive enough logs from the WMSP to produce the quantities and qualities required for production. If the supply 
issue was resolved, retesting the ponderosa pine round posts with the former soil compaction requirements would help 
sustain the product line, but the test was expensive (more than $100,000). Te ﬁrm was not willing to pursue further 
testing without assurance of a raw material supply. 
Forest Industry Cluster
Businesses described the importance of establishing a forest product industry cluster model in the White Mountains 
that created a balanced system and assured the viability of all business sectors. Many ﬁrms developed niches and 
levels of expertise (e.g. logging, power production, milling, manufacturing value-added products, etc.) that not only 
provided less competition for products/services within the cluster, but also promoted eﬃcient use of all segments of 
the log. A business owner said, “We have to all exist; if just one of you is there, the whole thing doesn’t work.” 

30
Types of Industry Matter
Businesses emphasized the types of industry that can process various segments of a tree were critical to establish 
a productive forest industry cluster in the White Mountains. A biomass power plant is a “key mechanism to 
forest health,” one owner said. Te biomass plant allowed for the removal of more material from the forest. Tis 
increased production per acre, further reduced ﬁre risk, and was a cost savings to the Forest (i.e. the Forest did 
not have to pile and burn the slash). 
Tis model promoted the highest and best value of production and price of ﬁnished goods. For example, the 
Vaagen Brothers Lumber mill bought superior grade saw logs at a higher price than Forest Energy that used 
forest byproducts (clean chips), a lower valued material. Tis model does not work if a primary consumer, such  
as a biomass energy plant or a high-speed, high-production sawmill, is missing.

manufactures pellets from 
wood chipped at the harvesting 
site and trucked to the plant.

However, this model faced challenges like inﬂated prices for raw material (especially in the last 3–5 years) as  
well as lacking a large, high production sawmill. High production sawmills serve as primary economic engines 
that can buy/utilize the highest valued material (the Vaagen Brothers Lumber mill only operated from December 
of 2012 to October of 2014 and was limited to processing small diameter logs, 5.5–13.5 inches DBH). According 
to business owners, another valued and necessary component of this model were companies that provided a 
relatively large number of high paying, beneﬁt eligible jobs (e.g. the paper mill employed more than 300 beneﬁt 
eligible positions). 
Location of Industry Is Important
Due to high transportation costs, it was critical to reduce haul distances to processing facilities, especially when 
the material was low-value biomass. To sustain an economically viable model, Forest staﬀ said that harvesting 
operations should lie within a 50- to 70-mile radius of processing facilities. Also important was locating 
mills centrally within the project area as well as having access to water and a railroad system. To operate cost 
eﬀectively, biomass plants need to minimize haul distances more than any other consumer. 
Markets Matter
According to business owners, business growth in the White Mountains was spurred by the WMSP. But 
demand dictated the types and quantities of products the market was able to absorb. For example, a ﬁrm’s 

31
president explained that the market was limited for products like vigas (a whole-log rafter used in southwestern 
style homes) and mulch. If too many ﬁrms produced these products, the market would become saturated and it 
would cause the price to drop to a point that a suitable proﬁt margin could not be realized. Terefore, developing 
innovative products that had a market and commanded the highest value was a necessary consideration in ﬁnding 
a productive business niche. One business described the change in their production as almost doubling, going 
from using 35,000 tons to 60,000 tons of material; however, this increase was due to both the WMSP and to 
market conditions. 
Forest Product Industry and Business Barriers and Challenges  
During the White Mountain Stewardship Project 
Lack of Infrastructure, Market Development, and Low Proﬁt Margins Drove Ineﬃcient Use of  
Raw Material
Te lack of industry to process high valued products, coupled with the volume that was being extracted from the 
forest in the ﬁrst years of the contract, forced the contractor to utilize the wood any way that they could. As a 
result, whole trees were chipped for lower valued products like pellets. 
In addition, businesses in the White Mountains reported minimal proﬁt margins. Producers often processed 
the raw material at the lowest cost, a business president explained, using the easiest, fastest method that yielded 
the highest production. According to a business owner, this method kept businesses aﬂoat and gave them the 
margin they needed to survive. For example, instead of distributing the various segments of a tree (e.g. saw logs, 
round wood, clean chips and dirty chips) to producers across the industry, whole trees were chipped for biomass. 
Adding to this, a mill to process larger logs was missing. For example, one of the existing mills in the WMSP 
area (the Vaagen Lumber mill) processed smaller logs—5.5 to 13.5 inches DBH. This resulted in chipping the 
large material rather than yielding the highest and best use for the logs. 
Eﬀects of the Wallow Fire 
In the summer of 2011, the Wallow Fire burned more than 500,000 acres in the White Mountains. Te 
Wallow Fire was comparable in size to the Rodeo-Chediski Fire in 2002. However, because of forest treatments 
implemented under the WMSP, the Wallow Fire burned less severely in treated areas and destroyed fewer 
structures than the Rodeo-Chediski. According to the report, "How Fuel Treatments Saved Homes from 
the Wallow Fire," earlier treatments outside of the WMSP that thinned fewer trees burned more severely 
than WMSP treatments (USDA 2011). Tis was also veriﬁed in a study conducted by Waltz et al. (2014) 
where ﬁndings revealed ﬁre severity was noticeably lower in treated versus untreated stands. According to 
FireﬁghterNation.com (Devone-Pacheco 2011), a total of 36 structures (32 homes and four commercial buildings) 
were lost in the Wallow Fire compared to 490 structures in the Rodeo-Chediski (WFLC 2010). Regardless, this 
ﬁre was devastating to the ecological, social, and economic conditions in the White Mountains. 
Te Wallow Fire occurred three years before the WMSC expired in 2014 and it contributed to the lack of wood 
supply. About 50,000 NEPA-approved acres burned in the ﬁre. Tis severely limited the available green, or 
unburned, acreage available to the contractor and subcontractors. After the ﬁre, the focus and majority of the 
work available on the Forest was salvage logging. According to a Forest staﬀ member, “A lot of projects fell oﬀ the 
shelf then because they were burned up … they hadn’t been treated yet.” For some mills, such as Vaagen Brothers 

32
Lumber, it could not retool fast enough to process the larger salvage trees. Burned trees have a harvest window 
before insects invade and logs deteriorate and lose value. Te NEPA planning necessary to approve many areas for 
salvage logging took too long. Tere was little federal government assistance and businesses were frustrated that 
the Forest did not have a contingency plan. 
In looking back, both the Forest and industry said they believed the WMSP should have worked more 
aggressively to harvest more acres before the Wallow Fire ignited, seven years after the project was initiated. 
However, there were constraints to treating acres at a certain pace and scale. For one, there was a lack of 
USFS funds to subsidize the project beyond approximately 5,000 acres per year. Tere was also a shortage of 
infrastructure to quickly process the material (e.g. Vaagen Brothers Lumber high-speed mill started too late). 
In 2011, the Wallow Fire burned more than 500,000 acres

Had more acres been thinned, a business owner speculated, the outcomes of the ﬁre might have been much less 
severe. However, one Forest staﬀ member said that simply doubling the treated acres would have barely made a 
dent in the number of acres that needed treatment on the ASNF. 
Te Forest Service Was Tinking Too Small
Limited supply (initial oﬀering of 5,000 acres annually), Forest staﬀ explained, was not enough to substantially 
increase the capacity of existing ﬁrms and attract qualiﬁed new businesses that were needed to expand industry in 
the region. He added that the agency was thinking “too small” and this had a profound eﬀect on the outcomes for 
industry and the project as a whole. 
Inconsistent Supply, Diminished Interest/Support as the WMSP Progressed
Most businesses reported that during the last four to ﬁve years of the WMSP, supply of raw material diminished, 
while the number of businesses competing for the material increased. Although the Forest developed a ﬁve-year 
work plan that was clearly communicated to industry, many ﬁrms said they were out of logs. Businesses reported 
that the contractor’s price for the raw material became so high that it was impossible to realize a proﬁt. Smaller 
ﬁrms were either outcompeted by the larger enterprises or were eliminated from the supply stream altogether. 

33
Now halfway through the WMSP, the reliability of the wood supply was in question. Further business 
investments and growth were deterred. During this time, some businesses closed and others moved toward 
ﬁnding alternative sources of raw material. For example, the inﬂated prices caused Novo BioPower to purchase 
only 10 percent of its material from the WMSP. Te majority of the material came from timber sale contracts 
outside of the WMSP and from thinning contracts in  
areas that contained pinyon-juniper. Novo BioPower also 
used green waste (approximately 5–15 percent of total 
production)—a inferior source of raw material—which 
was trucked on a backhaul approximately 175 miles from 
Phoenix to Snowﬂake, Arizona. 
Te Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI) became 
the largest stewardship contract in the nation in 2012. 
Its purpose is to restore 2.4 million acres across northern 
Arizona (USDA 2015). As this project was gearing up, many understood that the focus and support from the 
USFS, stakeholders, and interest groups shifted from WMSP to 4FRI. One business leader said, once 4FRI 
started, “Te old horse and the old dog didn’t look good anymore.” Industry in the White Mountains saw a 
shift in interest and continuity in the project because 4FRI was not subsidized—the WMSP cost the federal 
government $500 per acre, while the 4FRI contract expected a positive net cash ﬂow that is dependent on the 
biomass to saw log ratio on each task order. According to the business leader, 4FRI slowed down the work on the 
WMSP. He said he understood the problem was the money was tight but the work was needed because it was 
important preventative maintenance. “When you see the ﬁre raging over that mountain toward Alpine and you 
think the town is going to go and then it laid down [due to restoration treatments], that’s worth a lot of money.”
Other Challenges Facing Businesses and Industry 
Businesses identiﬁed other extraneous factors that had a negative impact on the progress and success of the 
WMSP. Some key challenges are detailed below.
1. High transportation costs. Many factors contributed to high transportation costs: 
a) Over the course of the project, diesel fuel prices rose more than expected; 
b) Arizona had lower weight restrictions for logging trucks relative to other Four Corner states. For 
example, at the time, Arizona’s weight limit (80,000 pounds per truck-load) was lower than that  
of New Mexico’s (86,400 pounds per truck-load) (FHWA 2000); and
c) Te White Mountains are located in a rural area associated with longer haul distances. 
2. Federal environmental analysis planning timeline. Te timeline to complete the environmental 
analysis was a common grievance among ﬁrms in the White Mountains. Tis was especially apparent and 
signiﬁcant when the NEPA analyses timeline exceeded the shelf life of the burned trees in the Wallow Fire. 
However, as stated earlier in the report, Forest staﬀ noted that the emphasis given to certain public interests 
(e.g. Mexican spotted owl and goshawk provisions) resulted in NEPA planning documents that were more 
complicated, time-consuming, and costly. 
3. Government regulations made it diﬃcult to compete in a global market. Enterprises believed federal 
government regulations included in the NEPA process increased their costs. One business owner said, “It’s 
the cost in dealing with the government.” For example, this owner said the price of Canadian wood was lower 
When you see the ﬁre raging 
over that mountain toward 
Alpine and you think the town is 
going to go and then it laid down 
[due to restoration treatments], 
that’s worth a lot of money.
“

34
than a comparable product in Arizona at the time mainly because Canadian ﬁrms privately own and operate 
their land and do not face government regulations.
4. Economic downturn. Te timing of the recession, about half way through the project, and its eﬀect on the 
housing industry and related products was a major deterrent. Most interviewees believed it had a profound 
eﬀect on overall project outcomes.  
5. Lack of a qualiﬁed, trained, dedicated workforce. Many ﬁrms reported adapting the workforce 
to produce an acceptable quality and quantity of work was a constant challenge. As an example, a ﬁrm’s 
operating manager cited a lack of work ethic in maintaining older milling equipment. Workers waited for 
breakdowns rather than practicing preventative maintenance. Some businesses reported this was overcome by 
paying higher wages and obtaining better quality employees. Mill operators eventually changed this culture, 
which ultimately prevented downtime at the mills.
While these external factors negatively impacted the outcomes of WMSP, it is to be expected that any long-term 
project will face uncertainties. 
Collaboration
Prior to and during the WMSP, several associations and collaborative groups emerged.
Multi-Party Monitoring Board
The White Mountain Multi-Party Monitoring Board (hereafter Board) consisted of a diverse set of stakeholders 
charged with monitoring the WMSP. Stewardship contracts are required to form multi-party monitoring boards 
to monitor and assess project treatments. Initially, Board members were appointed by the Forest Supervisor, 
which ensured a broad representation of interests. The Board oversaw ecological and economic monitoring and 
completed monitoring projects that the USFS did not normally do. However, a Board member explained that  
the group lacked resources for a concerted eﬀort in outreach and social monitoring. Regardless, this exceeded  
the agency’s “normal monitoring practices,” a Forest staﬀ member explained, and the Forest was supportive of  
the Board’s eﬀorts.
The Board provided various stakeholders, including environmental groups, the opportunity to consistently and 
continuously engage in the process. A stakeholder said, “[Based on the funding that was available to the Board], 
it was a modest eﬀort but a signiﬁcant one.” Te Nature Conservancy (TNC) played a key role in monitoring 
and was an intermediary between the Forest and environmental groups. TNC was trusted by many and seen as 
a neutral group that provided monitoring data. Tey brought a level of assurance that project eﬀects would be 
measured, tracked, and reported back to the agency, stakeholders, and the community. 
According to one stakeholder, given the small amount of funding received by the Board each year and the 
projects they chose, the monitoring group was able to represent the needs of multiple organizations. For example, 
the Board monitored treatment eﬀects on black bear habitat and habitat connectivity of Abert’s/red squirrels and 
Merriam’s wild turkey. Further, economic monitoring and reporting spanned the entire project (2005–2014).5 
Monitoring at this scale was ground breaking for federal forested lands. In 2010, the Board produced a report 
that summarized results of the ﬁrst ﬁve years of the various monitoring eﬀorts (Sitko and Hurteau 2010). A 
Board member said these results could be used to plan future treatments.
5 Assessment reports from 2005 to 2014, as well as other reviews and reports, are made available by the Apache-Sitgreaves 
National Forests and the White Mountain Stewardship Monitoring Board:

Scientists from NAU’s School of Forestry and the Ecological Restoration Institute provided scientiﬁc expertise 
for the Board. Scientists assisted with two additional monitoring reports for the second phase of monitoring 
(2010–2014). Tey measured various ecological indicators (e.g. tree species/diameters and woody surface fuels) 
to answer four monitoring questions (Chancellor et al. 2013 and 2015). Te monitoring questions and a brief 
summary of the ﬁndings are provided on p. 36.

Question 1: Is there a diﬀerence 
between pre-treatment crown ﬁre 
potential and post-treatment desired ﬁre 
behavior across selected analysis areas?
Findings: Treatments resulted in reductions in predicted ﬁre 
behavior and changed from active pre-treatment crown ﬁre potential 
to passive post-treatment crown ﬁre potential.
Question 2: What proportion of 
treated acres exhibited a change in 
Fire Regime Condition Class from 
2004 to 2014?
Findings: Treatments moved the forest along a trajectory toward less 
ecologically departed stands, similar to historic conditions. Te changes 
were very small, which is expected at the small scale of these treatments.
Question 3: Are patch sizes of denser 
(e.g. untreated or lightly treated) areas 
connected? What is the range of areas 
and sizes of these patches?
Findings: Connectivity of untreated and lightly treated areas was 
generally low across the project areas that were treated. However, little 
information is available to guide restoration prescriptions at emulating 
natural landscape patterns and there is no research to date that has 
indicated large patches of closed-canopied forest prior to historical ﬁre 
regime disruption.
Question 4: Are exotics/invasive 
species present at landings and slash 
piles? Identifying landings and slash 
piles following the Wallow Fire was 
diﬃcult; therefore, this question was 
modiﬁed to also examine if these 
species are more commonly found in the 
WMSP area in various microsites (type 
of ground cover and its density and the 
amount of sunlight were measured).
Findings: 1) Most invasive species were either in full sun or partial 
sun and none were found in predominantly shaded microsites; 2) The 
majority of invasives were found in areas of full sun and bare soil, but 
they were also the predominant ground cover in areas of partial sun 
and litter; 3) Most invasive species, with the exception of bull thistle, 
were recorded in recently burned areas; and 4) Less than 2 percent of 
invasives were in areas with evidence of landings or slash piles, and 14 
percent were recorded on roads or skid trails.
Interest Groups and Non-Governmental Organizations
Notable associations and collaborative groups such as Northern Arizona Wood Products Association, Little 
Colorado River Plateau Resource Conservation and Development, and the Southwest Sustainable Forest 
Partnership were important linkages with the wood products industry. In addition, the NRWG, forming prior 
to the WMSP, continued to work and collaborate throughout the life of the project. A stakeholder described the 
long-lasting relationships within these organizations and their interactions with the Forest as a testament to the 
commitments that provided “open, strong, and enduring” relationships. “We weren’t casual partners. Te stakes 
were real high.”  
The USFS, Future Forest, LLC, the CBD, TNC, and other stakeholders came together in an unprecedented 
uniﬁed approach that paved the way for a new era in collaborative forest management. Tese organizations 
understood the value of listening to others’ points of view and were able to compromise to meet common goals. 

37
For example, Forest staﬀ said they would inform concerned stakeholders (i.e. CBD) if trees larger than 16 inches 
DBH were considered for harvesting. Next, the Forest’s silviculturist would meet stakeholders on project sites to 
discuss implications. A Forest staﬀ member said this helped to inform all parties of the proposed actions  
upfront before any trees were cut, rather than be challenged after implementation. Tis strategy was highly 
successful throughout the project, and as trust in on-the-ground implementation increased, on-site visits  
became less necessary.
A stakeholder provided another example of compromise between 
conservation groups and the agency. During the planning stage 
of the Eagar South Project, the Regional Oﬃce released new 
goshawk guidelines that concerned some stakeholders. Te 
stakeholder recalled that it created “a huge amount of tension into 
a local collaborative situation.” Te interest group worked with 
the Forest Supervisor and the silviculturist to overcome this issue; 
however, this stakeholder believed that the Regional Oﬃce was 
distant and uncooperative later in the project. Another stakeholder said that a novel project like Eagar South 
needed “a spirit of experimentation and ﬂexibility” from everyone involved. Te stakeholder emphasized that 
it was important to forgo agendas and try new approaches like cutting trees greater than 16 inches DBH. The 
stakeholder continued to say, “It may not be perfect on every acre, but when you see the green trees standing after 
the Wallow Fire, we knew we did something right.”
Collaboration within the U.S. Forest Service
Regional Oﬃce and the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest
Businesses reported that at the start of the project, Regional and Forest leadership were project supporters and 
proponents. Seen as project “champions,” they were largely responsible for the ﬁrst 10-year stewardship contract 
in the nation going to the ASNF and not to other Forests competing for the project. In addition, these leaders 
worked together to reach project goals like strategically placed forest treatments in WUI areas. An industry 
leader said there was “agreement and total transparency [between the Forest and the Region].” Another business 
owner said, “It was the right people at the right time,” and that “it was a true partnership.”
However, after the ﬁrst ﬁve years of the project, the Forest and the Regional Oﬃce were challenged by a lack 
of funding. Assurances of continued funding were uncertain for a period of time. Tis was due to a decrease in 
the national budget, which funneled down and aﬀected USFS budgets. In eﬀect, the $5 million budget for the 
WMSP was the entire Region’s timber program budget (planning, site prep, and administration). A Forest staﬀ 
member said it was diﬃcult to keep the project on track with the Regional Oﬃce. Te staﬀ member continued 
to say, “People weren’t trying to deliberately undermine the experiment … It’s because the experiment was 
complicated and was not well understood.”
High turnover rates, which are common in the USFS, also presented challenges for the WMSP. When new 
leadership stepped in, they lacked knowledge of the project’s history and it often led to inconsistent visioning  
and ineﬃcient and unproductive on-the-ground decision making. When the ﬁrst Forest Supervisor left about half 
way through the project, it also presented problems for the Monitoring Board because they lost the administrative 
assistance that was initially provided by the Forest. 
It may not be perfect 
on every acre, but when 
you see the green trees 
standing after the 
Wallow Fire, we knew 
we did something right.

Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest and Other National Forests in Region 3 
As the project progressed, the ASNF developed a track record for on-the-ground accomplishments, while other 
Forests in the Region had projects tied up in legal challenges or were unable to conduct prescribed ﬁres due to 
unfavorable conditions. Meanwhile, other Forests in Region 3 were disgruntled by the notoriety and funding the 
WMSP received. Other units were concerned the ASNF was taking too much of the Region’s budget and believed 
that the WMSP was costing the agency more than was expected to accomplish the goals of the project. On the 
other hand, an ASNF staﬀ member spoke about his frustration over other Forests’ perceptions. He did not believe 
the ASNF was appropriately recognized for its substantial accomplishments and contributions in the Region.  
Business Collaboration with the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest 
Logging operators reported cooperative and productive working relationships with the Forest. Because the 
Forest was familiar with the landscape, mechanical operations, and the needs of the logging operators, contract 
administration and oversight was in line with on-the-ground operations. Operators said the Forest was ﬂexible, 
and their “openness to sharing and learning stood out.” Staﬀ worked hard to incorporate operator needs and 
geographically balanced harvesting with business locals. Businesses reported strong relationships with the Forest 
Supervisors often referring to them as “champions.” One business owner said, “I would give ﬁve gold stars to  
the local [Forest] Supervisor.”  
From the Forest’s perspective, there needed to be a ﬁne balance between a strong industry partnership and a 
“hands-oﬀ” approach. Te Forest was aware of the public wariness that the agency and industry would revert  
to former practices of high-grade logging. However, the Forest understood the risk businesses faced and worked 
closely with them to understand their needs. 
While the Forest tried to work with industry in the later years of the project, industry began to develop plans for 
expansion without consulting the Forest. Tis led to unrealistic expectations and resulting disappointments for 
industry. In addition, the Forest was uncertain of the various business relationships and who the contractor was 
representing. Te communication gaps resulted in inﬁghting and unrealistic demands for raw material supply  
that subsequently drove a wedge between the Forest and industry. 
Direct Business-to-Business Collaboration
Tere were times when raw ﬁber value was not optimized because  
the segments of the log were not distributed to specialized facilities 
for processing. Instead, whole trees were chipped for lower valued 
products such as pellets and bio-power. In the project’s later years, it 
became more prevalent because prices for raw material spiked. Tis increased competition for the raw ﬁber and 
broke down trust among industry sectors. Tese factors depleted the collaborative spirit needed for a healthy 
forest industry cluster. One business owner said, “Collaboration nurtures eﬃciency, but when supply is tight, 
this goes by the wayside.” However, when there was suﬃcient raw material available during the early years of the 
project, collaboration among industry was much stronger. 
The WMSP motivated Vaagen Brothers Lumber and Novo BioPower, two major industry players, to establish 
facilities near the project area. Private ﬁrms formed critical partnerships and alliances. Since the WMSP ended, 
Vaagen Brothers Lumber, Novo BioPower, and Tri-Star Logging have joined together to form a new company, 
Novo Star.

This new partnership is an example of a healthy forest industry cluster: Vaagen Brothers Lumber processes raw 
ﬁber into value-added ﬁnished products, Novo BioPower utilizes the byproducts from the sawmill for energy, 
and Tri-Star Logging harvests trees. A substantial portion of the company’s output is chipped biomass, which 
eliminates transportation cost of the lowest value material. A business owner described this as, “Twenty loads 
of logs turns into 14 loads of biomass and instead of just putting it on a truck and trucking it somewhere, [my 
company is] going to convey it to a pile [here] and burn it.” About this new partnership, one stakeholder said, 
“[Tis] mill infrastructure ﬁts the agreement perfectly … the appropriateness of being the right tool for the job 
really stuck.” 
Rural Economic Development and Community Outcomes
Economic Eﬀects
Most respondents believed economic eﬀects of the WMSP were substantial to the White Mountain region. 
However, Bureau of Labor Statistics data from 2014 reveal the number of businesses in forestry and wood 
manufacturing in Apache and Navajo counties dropped from 27 in 2005 to 21 in 2014, and they reached their 
highest level (29 businesses) in 2006 (Fig. 5). Employment also dropped in Apache and Navajo counties, from 
452 in 2005 to 278 in 2014 and peaked in 2006 (453 jobs) (Fig. 6). Decreases in these indicators could be explained 
by: 1) the inclusion of one-time data reporting from a large milling facility located in Phoenix, Arizona (this 
resulted in high ﬁgures in 2005/06); 2) the closing of Fort Apache Timber Company mill (2008); 3) the recession 
(peaked in 2008/09); and 4) the Wallow Fire (2011). Although trends show a decrease in the number of businesses 
and employment over the course of the project, the WMSP facilitated a diversity of potential jobs at relatively high 
pay scales. Considering the economic downturn and eﬀects from the Wallow Fire, most of the WMSP related 
businesses were able to maintain their businesses and adapt their business models to these changing factors.  
Similar to the 2014 Bureau of Labor Statistics ﬁndings, WMSP economic assessments (2005–2014) 
demonstrated jobs for businesses related to WMSP ranged from a total of approximately 160 to 460 per year (see 
Appendix B.1 for the estimated WMSP employment impacts over the 10-year period).6 Additional analyses were 
conducted for the ﬁnal two years of WMSP and are summarized on the next page.7  
6 To be consistent with previous economic monitoring reports and allow comparison over time, all employment impacts were 
calculated based on the Economic Base Theory and predetermined multiplier (1.63).  
7 We used the economic impact modeling software IMPLAN 3.0 to describe the contributions of the WMSP to the local economy 
for 2013-2014. For more details on the methodologies employed, see the 2013-2014 Economic Monitoring report.

40
In 2013 the WMSP-related businesses in the region generated (proportion directly attributable to WMSP):8
• 
more than 242 local jobs (51 percent), 
• 
$13 million in wages (45 percent), 
• 
$106 million in economic output/value of production (24 percent), and 
• 
$13 million in state and local tax revenues, including personal taxes and taxes on production and imports, 
such as sales and property taxes, motor vehicle licenses and severance taxes (13 percent). 
In 2014, the WMSP-related businesses in the region generated:
• 
about 292 local jobs (41 percent), 
• 
$17 million in wages (34 percent),
• 
$118 million in economic output (21 percent), and 
• 
$16 million in state and local tax revenues (11 percent).

Te NRWG and Northern Arizona Wood Products Association conducted a survey of enterprises in the White 
Mountains that revealed capital investments made by these businesses totaled more than $130 million over the 
course of the project. Te project also contributed to increased revenues for associated businesses such as auto/
equipment parts, diesel fuel, utilities, and the real estate market (multiplier eﬀect). For example, a milling ﬁrm 
reported local expenditures of: $26,000 on diesel fuel each week, $300,000–$400,000 in utilities annually, and 
$4,000–$5,000 on equipment parts each month. In addition, increases in retail sales added to the tax revenue 
base of local and state government.

Most respondents believed the majority of economic eﬀects occurred in the White Mountain region. However, 
some products were distributed throughout the state (e.g. vineyard posts, mulch) and some were distributed 
nationally (e.g. pellets) and internationally to Mexico (e.g. pallet stock). Equipment purchases were exclusively 
made out of state (Davis et al. 2014).

Social Eﬀects
Overall, the project improved the residents’ quality of life in numerous ways across the White Mountains. First 
and foremost, residents witnessed the positive impacts treatments had on ﬁre behavior and post-ﬁre eﬀects during 
the Wallow Fire—the ﬁre was stopped before burning into many communities and destroying homes. According 
to Forest staﬀ, the project received tremendous support from the community because they experienced the 

42
devastating eﬀects of the Rodeo-Chediski Fire. Community members understood treatments were necessary  
to protect their community. Te work the White Mountain Apache Indian tribe completed on tribal lands 
assisted with ﬁre prevention measures on federal lands. Many respondents reported the White Mountain 
Apaches had been proactive in implementing forest treatments that assisted in reducing the ﬁre’s advance in  
both the Rodeo-Chediski and Wallow ﬁres. 
Te fear of ﬁre caused towns in the White Mountains to compete for forest treatments. Harvesting operators 
said, “We had people pulling over telling us what a good job we did,” and, “Te whole mountain embraced  
the thinning.” 
One stakeholder said the local socio-political environment of the White Mountains community was fairly 
cohesive and, in his opinion, not as fragmented as other communities across the Southwest. Te culture allowed 
for scaling up and working cooperatively on a relatively large project like the WMSP. Te stakeholder added that 
the support from community members was “almost universal, kind of dramatic in its own right.” He added, “[I] 
can’t imagine an eﬀort that was more supported.” 
Although local residents were behind the project, many respondents stated seasonal residents, such as those living 
in Pinetop/Lakeside, were not as supportive. Since they did not live there year-round, they did not have ﬁrst-
hand experience of devastating wildﬁre impacts. Tey also had a diﬀerent perception of what the forest should 
look like and preferred what they were used to seeing, which was untreated, dense forests.
Public opinion evolved to support forest treatments as the project  
progressed, but business owners felt that continuous positive messaging 
was critical. A business owner said, “[We] have to have a uniﬁed 
message so the public understands the value of the forests.” He added it 
was important for the public to also understand the overall value the 
forest provides in the form of ecosystem services (e.g. scenic beauty, 
watershed and wildlife values, recreational opportunities, etc.). A business leader agreed and said, “Te beneﬁts 
that come from forests are unbelievable, because they are renewable resource.”

Overall Impact and Successes of the White Mountain 
Stewardship Project 
When asked about long lasting successes of the WMSP, individual business, forest product Industry and 
overarching legacies of the project were identiﬁed. 
Te WMSP maintained generational family businesses. One of the most signiﬁcant legacies of the WMSP 
was the ability to maintain generational family businesses. Several of these operators were ﬁfth and sixth 
generation loggers. Many of these business owners recounted their family’s involvement in the timber industry 
and how the WMSP provided the opportunity to continue the family legacy. Te WMSP proved that these ﬁrms 
were critical to the industries’ culture and their value and contributions should be preserved. One business owner 
said, “We can’t stop, it’s in our blood; we just keep trying and trying.” 
Reestablished forest products industry. Te WMSP revitalized a forest products industry that had once 
thrived in this region. Te USFS, interest groups, and citizens understood appropriately scaled industry was 
necessary for project success and past perceptions of industry as a contributor to degraded wildlife habitat and 
forest health slowly waned. Te WMSP also demonstrated that industry could process small diameter wood at a 
relatively large scale. Given the challenges that industry faced, they were able to conceptualize and produce added 
value products and build an eﬃcient and eﬀective forest industry cluster model. Forest staﬀ said the most 
remarkable success was the stewardship project itself. “It was a huge bold step into the unknown and all the folks 
that were involved in that creation deserve a huge pat on the back.”
Acres treated and the impact and beneﬁt to forest health. 
Many business owners said that the greatest beneﬁt and most 
laudable success of the project is witnessing ﬁrst-hand the treated 
forest. Te positive impact to forest health, watershed resiliency, 
and wildlife habitat was a huge beneﬁt and a substantial savings 
and investment for national, state, and local governments as well 
as private utilities (e.g. Arizona Public Service and Salt River Project) that provide water and power to residents 
across the state. A CEO said, “A lot of people deserve an award for that.” A Forest staﬀ member said, “It is 
probably one of the most outstanding achievements of the White Mountain Stewardship Contract … that work 
was accomplished.” 
Cooperation among USFS, stakeholders, and citizens. Considering the social/political climate prior to  
the WMSC, including the MSO controversy that according to one interviewee “choked and killed the industry,” 
many highlighted the project’s successful collaboration. In the contract’s 10 years, there were no legal challenges 
or appeals to slow or stop treatments. 
Te Forest, contractor, and interest groups decided to focus on the majority of issues that they agreed upon, 
rather than a few issues where there was disagreement. A representative of a conservation group interviewed said 
it became clear the contractor and interest groups held similar objectives. Tey said, “We moved from being a 
watchdog group to a true cooperator and collaborator.” Te environmental groups in the White Mountains also 
kept outside interest groups (e.g. Wild Earth Guardians) disengaged because they had trust that conservation 
groups directly involved would represent their interests. 
A Forest line oﬃcer understood the need to foster cooperation because, they said, this was not “business as usual.” 
Te line oﬃcer understood compromise was needed and said, “[It is time to] let them feel victory.” Another 
representative from the Forest said, “Te 6,000 to 8,000 acres that were accomplished every year were actually 
It was a huge bold step into 
the unknown and all the 
folks that were involved  
in that creation deserve  
a huge pat on the back.
“

44
done, so I give big kudos to everybody involved—the Forest Service, the environmental community and the 
contractor—in having a relationship there that allowed that work to be done.” Tis level of cooperation was a 
formidable shift in values and had a profound eﬀect on the success of the WMSP. Te collaborative relationships 
serve as a model for a similar community-based project.
Community impact was profound. Tere was a notable economic impact from the WMSP on the small,  
rural communities scattered throughout the White Mountains. Similarly, a stakeholder said, the WMSP  
created a “signiﬁcant” amount of community pride. After the Rodeo-Chediski Fire, the community faced 
problems head-on and developed solutions to prevent another severe wildﬁre. A Forest staﬀ member said the 
success of treatments in the Wallow Fire “galvanized” community members, and the “ﬁnger-pointing” from  
the Rodeo-Chediski Fire faded. “When the Wallow ﬁre came over the hill, it worked and what a great feeling,” 
a stakeholder said. “Tat success is pretty amazing,” He added that the Wallow Fire marked a new era of 
cooperation and collaboration by “pivoting on the future, rather than dwelling on old battles.” Te focus also 
turned to sustaining forest health for future generations.
Reduced wildﬁre risk and saved communities: Wallow and San Juan ﬁres as evidence. Evidence from  
the Wallow (June 2011) and San Juan (June 2014) ﬁres showed that ﬁre risk was reduced and forest treatments 
worked. In the absence of a guaranteed supply and an industry to process the raw material, most respondents 
believed the ﬁres would have had devastating impacts. Business owners said that during the Wallow Fire, towns 
and lives in the eastern portion of the White Mountains—Alpine, Greer, Nutrioso, and Eagar—were saved 
because of the treatments. One business owner said, “Tat was inspirational to us.” A stakeholder said evidence 
of treatment eﬀectiveness from the Wallow and San Juan ﬁres assisted in paving the way toward large-scale 
landscape restoration. 
Set the stage for the upcoming largest stewardship contract in the nation—Te Four Forest Restoration 
Initiative (4FRI). Te WMSP, the longest and largest restoration project in the nation at the time, had a high 
proﬁle and allowed for innovation for an economically eﬀective model to emerge.  Te project stimulated private 
industry advances and was what one business leader called “a stepping stone to [the next largest stewardship 
contract in the nation], the 4FRI.” Many said that in the absence of the WMSP, the 4FRI project would not  
be a reality today. 
Two burn areas from the 2011 Wallow Fire experienced drastically different ﬁre intensities. The previously 
treated area (right) had a low ﬁre intensity due to the prior removal of excess fuels. This ﬁre burned mostly 
on the ground with a high tree survival rate. The untreated area (left) experienced a high-intensity crown 
ﬁre that scorched all of the trees and understory.

Lessons Learned and Recommendations 
Lessons learned from the WMSP and recommendations to develop solutions are outlined in this section.  
At times, several lessons learned are grouped and recommendations are collectively presented. 
Project Initiation
Be Ready to Act: Increase Capacity Trough Diverse Funding
A Forest Supervisor described defending constituents in the 
aftermath of the Rodeo-Chediski Fire. Tey said, “To pull oﬀ what 
the public was demanding … to treat these forests … this is the 
time and place and we just needed to go do it. I personally could 
not stand up to those communities that had the big ﬁre like that 
and say, well we’re just going to continue as we always have. I just 
couldn’t do that anymore.” 
Tis leader understood how the stewardship contract mechanism would obtain the cooperation, funding, support, 
and the legal leverage needed to meet public demands. Tis leader recognized the important opportunity to bring 
the WMSP to the ASNF and reacted quickly to secure the contract. 
Promote a Sense of Urgency: Develop Scalable Solutions
Te MSO controversy in the mid-90s and the legal challenges the agency faced created a culture of 
“complacency” in the agency, a Forest Supervisor recalled. Te agency released timber sales for years, but the 
projects were often mired in litigation. As a result, completed environmental analyses often lacked agency 
motivation to move the projects forward. Te Supervisor said, “Tey just gave up on it.” However, after the 
Rodeo-Chediski Fire, a sense of urgency quickly replaced apathy within the ASNF. Te ASNF realized forest 
treatments were a solution to an exponentially growing problem. 
Industry leaders and stakeholders also understood the importance of ﬁre risk reduction in the WUI and agreed 
to work together to move forward. For one, they realized that severe stand replacing wildﬁres were no longer 
hundreds or thousands of acres, the new norm was half a million acres. As a result, the NRWG sought a broader 
solution to match the scale of the problem by promoting long-term supply guarantees with service contracts.  
Lessons Learned and Recommendations 
I personally could not stand 
up to those communities 
that had the big ﬁre like 
that and say, well we’re just 
going to continue as we 
always have.

Recommendations: 
To address disastrous disturbance events (e.g. large uncharacteristic stand replacing wildﬁres) with long-
term solutions (e.g. forest treatments) and outcomes (e.g. ﬁre resilient forests), seize opportunities to increase 
agency and industry capacity and/or allocate resources. To begin forest management initiatives:
1. Select an appropriately scaled mechanism and funding source (e.g. stewardship contract).
2. Seek alternative non-traditional funding sources (e.g. grants, publicly funded initiatives (bonds, taxes, 
user fees, etc.) to conduct forest treatments on public and private land; recent examples include:
a) Arizona: Flagstaﬀ Watershed Protection Project funded treatments on city, state and federal lands 
through a City voter-approved $10-million bond (Mottek Lucas 2015).
b) Oregon: Ashland Forest Resiliency Stewardship Project received $6.2 million in American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act funding. Additional funding was secured from the Joints Chiefs Landscape 
Restoration Partnership Program and the USFS Hazardous Fuels programs (AFR 2016).  
c) New Mexico: Santa Fe Municipal Watershed Restoration Project developed an initial plan that was 
funded by a USDA USFS Collaborative Forest Restoration Program grant. Since May 2013, the City 
of Santa Fe water utility rates have covered the City’s obligations under this plan. Te cost to retain the 
restored forest condition over 20 years is estimated at $5.1 million, an average of $258,000 per year.
Support Leaders Willing to Take Risks
Te Forest Supervisor who initiated the WMSP was a leader willing to take risks. Tey described the incentive 
as, “If we’re asking all of these other people to take risks and stand up and make changes, [the Forest Service] 
better be able to do those ourselves.” Without these leadership qualities, the ﬁrst large scale 10-year stewardship 
contract in the nation might not have been on the ASNF. 
Recommendations: 
Identify, recruit, and support leaders who are willing to take risks.
Support Pilot Projects 
The Blue Ridge Demonstration Project opened the door for various groups to work together to test and develop 
novel ideas and processes for: 1) experimental prescriptions, 2) administrative processes (contracting/subsidies), 
3) new technologies and harvesting operational eﬃciencies, 4) collaborative relationships and the formulation 
and development of trust, and 5) building capacity. Tis led to the concept and operation of a small-scale 
experimental project with a broader vision and helped to bring the WMSP to the ASNF.

47
Recommendations: 
To develop and test novel concepts and practices, promote and incentivize small-scale pilot projects that will 
assist in learning and foster similar processes on a larger scale.
Collaboration
Foster Broad-Based Collaboration and a Multi-Party Monitoring Program
Te relationship building that occurred within the WMSP, coined by some as “collaborative conservation,” 
contradicted outdated past premises of both the agency and environmental organizations and introduced a new 
era and culture within these entities. With this came the understanding that industry is a critical component to 
get the job done and was no longer viewed as an antagonistic player in forest management and restoration. Tis 
created a productive and positive working environment with honest, open dialogue where common ground and 
goals were discussed.
The Multi-Party Monitoring Board directed the collection and analysis of best available science by scientists at 
NAU and the Ecological Restoration Institute. Interest groups trusted that treatments were grounded in science, 
and groups with varying perspectives found they could work through tough questions. “We can learn from each 
other, make commitments to each other to get us through tough times,” a stakeholder said. 
Te WMSP is an example of eﬀective collaboration across a wide array of interests. Te cooperation was built 
over time, ﬁrst with the Blue Ridge Demonstration Project and then formation of the NRWG, seven years prior 
to the inception of the WMSP. Further trust evolved with the Multi-Party Monitoring Board eﬀort. Together, 
these relationships resulted in positive outcomes for the WMSP. 
Recommendations: 
1. Work with an already established collaborative group or form critical partnerships to: 1) deﬁne the 
issue and scope of the project, 2) reach agreements, 3) develop solutions, and 4) lobby state and federal 
legislatures for support and funding to increase capacity.
2. Support a collaboratively developed monitoring program, with interest groups, industry, academic 
institutions, local and state government, and the USFS.
3. Use successful outcomes of past projects, like the WMSP, to leverage government funding for forest 
management projects that includes a monitoring program. For example, in the case of the WMSP, saving 
communities in the Wallow Fire and unprecedented cooperation amongst stakeholders resulted in no legal 
challenges. Tese were formidable successes and should be emphasized to encourage further congressional 
appropriations, grants, and other ﬁnancial assistance that would support forest restoration projects.

48
Advance Industry: Form U.S. Forest Service Partnership
From the wood products industry perspective, the USFS and industry 
must align as true partners to assure project success. A business owner said, 
“Te only way to have well managed forests is to have healthy industry and 
they are a true partner in management of the forest and in providing these 
beneﬁts [clean water/air, wildlife, etc.] to society.”  
Many ﬁrms involved with the WMSP worked diligently toward developing value-added products from small 
diameter ponderosa pine. A mill owner explained that the WMSP was a learning experience in many areas: 
thinning small diameter trees and delivering, storing, and air drying the logs. “We invested and lost a couple of 
million dollars to prove the math, which we did.” He added, “Te experts are the people that make it work on the 
ground—with the thinning and processing … I am sure that we are the small log experts in the United States 
and to have the Forest Service at all these levels not come up and ask us: ‘Can you help us and ﬁx this dilemma?’ 
and ‘Would you be willing, and what would it take?’” 
One stakeholder said the industry and the agency were disconnected at times. He said, “One thing we’ve learned 
after the last 10 years, is that we are all in this together. We need those businesses to be robust and vibrant and 
well-stocked with the materials to keep them operating. [Tis works] as long as it does not take over as the 
driver.” Forest staﬀ agreed that close cooperation is needed with industry. Industry has experienced this massive 
change ﬁrst-hand and should be consulted to review and improve upon past agency policies and procedures. He 
continued to say that lessons learned during the WMSP need to be relayed to decision makers, especially those 
without on the ground experience. 
From the agency’s perspective, industry needed to fully understand how the USFS operates—its funding cycles, 
mechanisms, political environment, and national budgets. For example, during the WMSP, the Forest developed 
an internal ﬁve-year work plan and shared it with industry; however, industry made plans for expansion without 
consulting the Forest. Industry was ultimately disappointed because it had unrealistic expectations, which then 
created tension between the agency and industry. 
Considering these diﬀerent perspectives, clear communication among entities would increase the potential 
for positive outcomes. Te USFS needed a comprehensive understanding of the economic factors required for 
industry’s sustainability, while industry was obliged to fully conceptualize the agency’s structure and processes.

have well managed 
forests is to have

“

49
Recommendations: 
1. To advance an eﬀective USFS-Industry partnership that results in realistic expectations and future 
planning throughout the life of the project, clearly communicate each group’s operational processes. Tis 
can be achieved by creating two critical positions that link these groups:  
1) a forest industry analyst position at the Forest level, and 2) an industry liaison position. 
2. Form a cooperative organization, or “co-op,” managed by a neutral intermediary organization that 
provides access to all types of raw material at competitive prices. A co-op would meet industry needs 
and be a critical link to current USFS supply. Tis would provide consistency in the supply chain so 
both industry and the agency can execute business/work plans that accurately reﬂect future industry 
demand and supply of raw material from federal lands.  
3. Troughout the life of the project, conduct program evaluations that track strengths and weaknesses of 
industry to USFS relationships and oﬀer solutions for improved communication and interaction. 
Contractual Process
Evaluate Subsidies
Most respondents believed that subsidies were necessary to thin small trees and remove biomass. Tis material 
has low value and the costs are high to remove and transport it. Forest staﬀ explained that the projected volume 
of ﬁber removed per acre at the start of the WMSP was 10.7 tons. Te actual amount extracted was an average  
of 25.8 tons per acre (more than double). But, the WMSP subsidy did not decrease over the course of the project. 
Tere are several assumptions why the subsidy did not decrease: 1) the recession, 2) the eﬀects of the Wallow 
Fire, and 3) the high costs of biomass removal and transportation. However, many factors, such as increased 
contractor operating eﬃciencies and increased volume removed per acre, should have had a positive net eﬀect for 
the contractor. It is assumed the contractor’s operating costs were decreasing, while businesses reported increasing 
prices and revenues for the raw material. But, it is unclear if the contractor’s revenues exceeded costs over the 
course of the project.   
A Forest staﬀ member said, “In the next iteration of stewardship that private industry pays for all of it. I’m 
not certain anybody has found the formula yet to succeed in doing that in Arizona.” About transitioning from 
subsidies in the WMSP to none in 4FRI, a ﬁrm’s CEO said, “How you jump from [the USFS] paying [the 
contractor] $500 per acre [to the contractor paying the agency] is beyond me.”
A Forest staﬀ member suggested that in order to adequately assess the applicability of subsidies, there should be 
enough ﬂexibility in the contract to “learn and take advantage of new insights and opportunities.” For example, 
as volume per acre increased, having a protocol in the contract to expedite provisions (the subsidy amount was 
evaluated every two years), might have inﬂuenced the subsidy rate overtime. 
While it was characterized that the WMSP cost the federal government $500 per acre to treat, there were 
several areas where beneﬁts to the agency and the public were realized. For example, eliminating or minimizing 
the need to pile burn in some areas decreased expenses for the agency, and in turn, could be used to subsidize 
the contractor for slash removal and transport. Although a full cost accounting of the Wallow Fire has not been 

50
conducted, assessments and studies conﬁrm that treatments prior to the Wallow Fire saved homes, conserved 
forest resources and supported the forest’s resiliency. Further, costs to the agency were reduced as the agency was 
able to scale up when it completed planning, administration, and site prep for an expanded number of acres. 
Recommendations: 
Develop a contractual evaluation protocol that includes a reasonable timeframe to assess and respond to 
changing factors throughout the life of the contract. Several steps have been identiﬁed to achieve this:
Step I. To ensure the contract aligns with industrial indicators, involve industry in contract development/
requirements by tracking a variety of outputs like: 
1. Acres treated (acre to volume relationship);
2. Proportion of biomass to saw logs;
3. Contractor’s operating expenses—based on terrain, aspect, tree density, tree sizes, etc. (e.g. loading, 
hauling, mobilization, etc.);
4. Revenue of the raw material;
5. Value and types of products produced; and
6. Incorporation of novel technologies and processes as they develop.
Tis information would result in: 
1. Matching harvesting operational costs to contractual requirements,
2. Aligning raw material pricing to market ﬂuctuations and demands, and
3. Providing a reasonable ﬁgure needed to incentivize the contract.
Step II. Based on information collected in Step I, if subsidies are deemed necessary, regular assessments 
(based on a predetermined timeframe) should include: 
1. Te amount of the subsidy, 
2. Te duration of the subsidy, and
3. Te necessity of selective subsidies (based on speciﬁc acres that are more expensive to treat). 
Step III. Design subsequent contracts by incorporating lessons learned from prior contracts that include 
agency and industry perspectives. For example, enlist the expertise of the newly created USFS industry 
analyst and industry liaison positions.

51
Determine the Best Performance Measure 
Te WMSP contractor was paid for green tons (volume) removed (a formula derived by the agency equated this 
to $500 per acre), which had its advantages and disadvantages. For the contractor and some producers of ﬁnished 
products, tons (green or bone dried) was preferred because it eliminated uncertainty of the variable stocking levels 
on each acre and the variable amounts of water in the raw material. Te advantage to the contractor (paid on 
volume) was necessary to incentivize an experimental project. Te agency, though, preferred acres because that 
metric matched agency targets and was better understood by decision-makers and political leaders. 
Compensating the contractor on a per acre basis might incentivize the contractor to treat acres where costs are 
lowest and/or revenues are highest. For example, under this model, the contractor might prioritize areas that are 
more accessible (e.g. ﬂat terrain, availability of road systems, etc.) and/or have more merchantable sized timber. 
Tey may avoid treating areas that contain larger portions of small diameter material/biomass or are diﬃcult 
to access. Te areas that are most cost eﬀective to the contractor are not always the areas prioritized for ﬁre risk 
reduction objectives. In projects like the WMSP, it is necessary to derive a metric that incentivizes treating areas 
with high fuel loads and ﬁre risk.
Recommendations: 
In an experimental project with numerous unknowns (e.g. the acre-to-volume relationship) like the 
WMSP, paying the contractor on weight made sense. Considering fuel reduction objectives and industry 
viability, both metrics should be tracked longitudinally to better understand:
1. Te acre-to-volume relationship that can be used by both the USFS and industry for  
future planning, and 
2. Te cost per acre to assess whether eﬃciencies are increasing for both entities. 
Track the following: 
Acre-to-volume relationship:
1. Average green tons per acre 
2. Proportion of biomass to merchantable ﬁber
USFS and industry costs:
1. Agency costs (e.g. planning, administration, site prep, etc.)
2. Industry costs (e.g. harvesting operations, transportation, etc.)
Questions to consider: 
1. Are eﬃciencies of both entities increasing and, subsequently, are costs decreasing? 
2. As utilization per acre increases, are net treatment costs decreasing and does this eﬀect translate to 
lowering or eliminating subsidies?
3. As utilization per acre increases, is this a result of economies of scale that allows for greater 
revenue and decreasing costs per unit of biomass?

52
Track On-the-Ground Processes and Eﬃciencies
Te COR position, who oversaw in-the-woods operations, was housed at the Regional Oﬃce in New Mexico. 
Tis position’s geographic separation from the project and lack of practical experience created apprehension for 
both the Forest and the loggers. Logging operators and Forest personnel reported most staﬀ in this position 
did not understand the daily harvesting operations. At times, it deterred harvesting operational eﬃciencies and 
increased costs for the contractor and subcontractors. Tis situation was compounded by the position’s high 
turnover rate throughout the WMSP. A stakeholder said that with the inevitable “revolving door” of key staﬀ 
from the USFS, it was vital that replacements share a “common vision” about the project’s goals and objectives 
with their predecessors. 
Recommendations: 
Create a contracting mechanism that supports a Forest-level COR who has on-the-ground experience and 
understands local harvesting operational processes and eﬃciencies. When replacing agency staﬀ, assure: 1) there 
is a transition plan in place, and 2) their visions and principles are in line with project goals and objectives.

Address Davis Bacon Act Wage Requirements 
Davis Bacon Act wage, also known as the prevailing wage, is a required pay rate and scale under Acquisition 
Management (AQM) contracts like the WMSC. Te Forest and industry agreed that because the raw material 
had little to no value, the Davis Bacon wage was a major barrier that deeply aﬀected both the contractor and 
subcontractors’ bottom lines. If the value of the raw material is not enough to oﬀset the cost to treat the forest and 
pay the prevailing wages, Forest staﬀ believed that a subsidy is necessary. 

53
Recommendations: 
To evaluate whether Davis Bacon wages are indicative of regional labor wage rates:
1. Verify how rates are calculated with the Department of Labor;
2. Independently assess current wage rates by administering regional contractor/subcontractor surveys; 
3. Promote diﬀerential pay scales (through legislative processes) that reﬂect workers’ skill and 
experiential levels;
4. Develop an apprentice/journeyman certiﬁcation program through an academic institution—this  
will provide a training period for the workforce and lessen the pay burden to industry;
5. Create an equitable compensation that would oﬀset the discrepancy of prevailing wage and industry 
standard wage in the region; and/or
6. Use a contractual instrument that does not have the Davis Bacon wage requirement.
Administer Overlapping Contracts to Assure Supply Continuity 
Respondents identiﬁed four issues that all can be resolved through administering overlapping contracts: 1) 
Businesses required a suﬃcient timeframe to amortize investments; 2) There was a need to ensure a consistent  
raw material supply; 3) The single contractor system could use improvements; and 4) At close of the contract,  
a transition plan should be in place.
Suﬃcient Timeframe to Amortize Investments
Most ﬁrms and Forest personnel overwhelmingly agreed the contract period of 10 years made it diﬃcult for 
businesses to amortize large investments in equipment and infrastructure and to develop new business models 
(e.g. markets, products, operating eﬃciencies). Most respondents believed the length and size of the contract 
(5,000 acres annually) signiﬁcantly aﬀected the type, size, and experience of industry involved. Most ﬁrms 
working with the WMSP were small, family owned and operated businesses, which were appropriately scaled  
for the size of the contract. A mill operator said that a large high-speed, high-production sawmill costs $30 to 
$50 million to build. Considering the size of investments, it was diﬃcult for companies to amortize them in a  
10-year period. As a result, larger enterprises steered clear of the project. 
Assurance of a Consistent Raw Material Supply 
Prior to the WMSP, supply of raw material from federal land was inconsistent and unreliable. Te WMSP had 
the potential to reverse this trend, but there were many factors that prevented a reliable, steady supply stream: 
1.  Federal funding limitations markedly reduced the number of acres that could be treated. 
2.  Te Wallow Fire burned the majority of the remaining NEPA-ready acres (50,000 acres). 
3.  Te sole contractor limited supply to and set prices for ﬁrms in the White Mountains. 
4.  Te 4FRI project diminished support and interest in the WMSP.
One Forest staﬀ member said, “Continuity is probably a key item to focus on in the future on these projects. 

54
How do you maintain continuity from the inception of the project through its conclusion? Continuity in intent, 
continuity in ﬁnancial support to the project.”
While supply consistency and a level of planning certainty is needed for corporate decision making, wood supply 
is dynamic and hinges on social and ecological factors that are beyond the agency’s control (e.g. large, severe 
wildﬁres; drought; insect infestations; threatened and endangered species, etc.). To minimize uninterrupted 
wood supply and to assure the success of long term contracts, contracts should be ﬂexible and provide evaluative 
components that can respond to changing factors.  
Improvements to the Single Contractor System 
Te sole contractor system presented advantages and disadvantages. Te single contractor provided beneﬁts 
of: brokering raw material, eliminating the competitive bidding system, and paying subcontractors on time. 
However, it also reduced competition since the market now did not dictate the price. Te contractor set the price 
and industry in Arizona found it diﬃcult to compete with national and global markets. Te single contractor 
system also increased competition among consumers, which prevented the forest industry cluster model from 
fully developing. 
Although lack of contractor competition was highlighted as a barrier by most ﬁrms, this subsidized economic 
model could not support a free market system. Instead, the sole contractor system eliminated the competitive 
bidding process and provided stability, reliability, and accountability and it assumed risks that might challenge 
multiple timber sale contractors. 
Have a Transition Plan in Place 
Many enterprises in the White Mountains were concerned about the future of their businesses at the close of the 
contract. Most mills and ﬁnished manufacturers interviewed said they were out of logs and could not ﬁll orders. 
If companies in the region folded, many businesses believed the successes of and investments in the WMSP 
would also be lost. Investments included $130 million in industry capital investments (equipment and 
infrastructure); $50 million in federal funds; more than $7 million in grants and ﬁnancial assistance; and 
numerous in-kind and ﬁnancial contributions made by various stakeholders. 
Te ﬁrst phase of 4FRI project began in 2012, with most harvesting 
activities planned for the Coconino and Kaibab national forests to 
the west of the White Mountains. Tis created a gap in supply for 
industry in the White Mountains. Many respondents said the WMSP 
“paved the way” for other stewardship contracts like 4FRI, and did 
not understand why the stewardship contract would begin in an area 
where little infrastructure existed. One ﬁrm’s president said, “We were 
open minded and optimistic, but [with 4FRI] it was tempered and our 
optimism [was] diluted.” 
During these transition periods from one stewardship contract to another, it is paramount that there is a plan to 
assure supply to already established businesses. A stakeholder said, “Tat was our biggest downfall in not putting 
a lot of thought and action into creating a sustainable model that would last beyond the 10 years.” A business 
owner agreed and said, “Fill current infrastructure with aﬀordable, meaningful ﬁber and you’ll get acres treated 
sooner rather than later. [Te Forest Service] needs to maintain infrastructure while we create the new generation 
[of industry].”
Fill current 
infrastructure with 
aﬀordable, meaningful 
ﬁber and you’ll get 
acres treated sooner 
rather than later.
“

55
As the WMSP contract expired and the 4FRI project began, there was little transition and assurance of supply for 
existing businesses. To maintain contract duration (10 years), contracts should be sequenced to minimize supply 
gaps. Also, selecting a diplomatic and impartial contractor would assist in the overall success of the project.
Recommendations: 
1. Initiate overlapping contracts with various contractors to minimize the interruption of a consistent, 
accurately forecasted wood supply stream to businesses throughout the region.
2. Evaluate contractor performance (e.g. conduct surveys/interviews with businesses) that would inform 
contractor selection of future contracts.
Forest Industry Cluster Model
Support a Triving Forest Industry Cluster Model
Industry evolved during the WMSP to ﬁll various niches to process all components of the tree. Tis included 
pressure treated post and poles on the high end, and bio-power on  
the low end. However, over the 10 years, many factors prevented 
the development of a well-rounded, highly functioning forest 
products industry cluster:
1. Critical infrastructure was missing: 1) a biomass energy 
facility (this facility opened and closed many times over the 
course of the project and was ﬁnally reestablished by Novo 
BioPower in 2013), and 2) a large high-production sawmill 
(the Vaagen mill was limited to processing logs from 5.5–13.5 inches DBH and only operated for two years); 
2. The sole contractor system created gaps in the supply stream; and 
3. Ineﬃcient use of raw ﬁber (i.e. chipping whole trees) resulted in lost potential for the highest and best use  
of the raw material. 
One stakeholder said that these three factors defeated the concept of stewardship. A Forest staﬀ member said, 
“It’s not the ‘who,’ but ‘what’ you select as the product. You need a product that has suﬃcient value to actually 
oﬀset the cost of the treatment.”  
Recommendations: 
1. Conduct a needs assessment to ensure a thriving forest industry cluster and to better understand gaps 
in infrastructure, supply, and production. Results can guide industry, the agency, and stakeholders to 
improve outcomes in ﬁre risk reduction/forest restoration objectives and industry’s viability. 
2. Develop and support programs (e.g. payment for ecosystem services, grants) that incentivizes 
establishment, growth, and expansion of a broad-based forest industry cluster.  
3. Conduct research and development for small diameter ponderosa pine value-added products.
It’s not the ‘who,’ but 
‘what’ you select as the 
product. You need a 
product that has suﬃcient 
value to actually oﬀset 
the cost of the treatment.

National Environmental Policy Act and Ecological Outcomes
Collaborate to Improve Ecological Outcomes
Most respondents believed the NEPA planning process for the WMSP was time consuming and over regulated. 
However, Forest staﬀ noted that addressing public concerns about forest treatment eﬀects, particularly on wildlife 
like the MSO, increased the NEPA document’s complexity and the time and cost related to the environmental 
planning process.
Te lack of legal challenges and subsequent delays in on-the-ground implementation was noted as an 
achievement. To reach agreements, potentially contentious issues (e.g. harvesting trees larger than 16-inches 
DBH) were debated on a project-by-project basis. This process assured all parties were informed up front, which 
alleviated potential lawsuits and delays. As the project progressed, trust in on-the-ground implementation 
increased, which minimized the necessity of site visits. Rather than adding complexity and restrictions to the 
NEPA documents, the USFS and stakeholders found a way to informally and adequately address their concerns. 
Although the diameter cap was a verbal agreement between the Forest and CBD, the cap was often used in the 
WMSP treatments. Te verbal agreement demonstrated that the agency was willing to listen and respond to 
stakeholder concerns.  
While the diameter cap assured conservation groups that large trees would not be harvested, in some areas, it 
might have limited ﬁre risk reduction goals. Forest staﬀ suggested that rather than adopting a diameter cap, 
a monitoring system similar to that of the WMSP could oﬀset concerns. He added that eliminating a strict 
cap would also improve outcomes for industry (i.e. increased availability of various sized logs would improve 
opportunities to produce a broader range of products). 
Recommendations: 
Create a monitoring system that assures the public’s interests and concerns are considered and met. In 
turn, this will assist in reducing limitations in achieving the project’s socioeconomic and ecological goals 
and would reduce the complexity and requirements in NEPA, resulting in a shorter planning timeline and 
decreased costs.

Grants and Financial Assistance
Incentivize Projects with Financial Assistance
Grants and ﬁnancial assistance were largely available to organizations and enterprises before and during the 
WMSP. Tese grants assisted businesses, NGOs, and municipalities with equipment acquisition, business 
planning, product and market development, and provided businesses with tax savings. Tese incentives helped to 
jump-start creativity and innovation for a project like the WMSP. 
Recommendations: 
Create opportunities to incentivize novel projects and innovations with grants and other ﬁnancial assistance.
Outreach and Education
Promote Statewide Outreach Campaigns
As public support for the project grew, residents adapted to the aesthetic change in forest structure. Public 
demand for forest treatments also increased. But, seasonal residents were harder to persuade. 
Although communities in the White Mountains were aﬀected by two large, severe wildﬁres in the span of 
nine years, memories of ﬁres and their eﬀects often fade with time. And with time, support for treatments can 
wane. For this reason, it is important to keep the public aware and informed through continuous outreach and 
education programs. 
Recommendations: 
Develop and conduct statewide campaigns with a uniﬁed message to include:
1. Support for ﬁre mitigation and overall forest health initiatives through active forest management;
2. Te value of forest treatments that maintain and enhance various ecosystem services (e.g. wildlife, 
recreation, watershed protection/improvements, etc.); 
3. Gear campaigns toward the public (especially focused on seasonal residents and land owners), decision 
makers, and municipal, state, and congressional leaders.

Statewide Strategy 
Support a Statewide Strategy that Includes Industry and Restoration Goals 
Te WMSP demonstrated that operational cost savings and improved eﬃciencies assisted the forest products 
industry. To promote these processes and incentivize industry, developing a statewide strategy that includes  
multi jurisdictional lands and agencies and programs is an ideal model to collaboratively plan and execute  
various approaches.
An example of such a program is the Arizona Department of Transportation’s Healthy Forest Initiative that 
launched in November 2014. Weight limits increased from 80,000 to 90,000 pounds per truck-load, which gave 
Arizona companies a competitive edge because they had the ability to move more material from the woods to 
processing sites. 
Recommendations: 
Create a multijurisdictional statewide strategy that includes operational costs savings and eﬃciencies for the 
forest product industry by: 
1. Strategically placing infrastructure to minimize haul distances from harvesting sites to processing 
facilities.  
2. Sharing and strategically locating kilns and scales. 
3. Adopting agency policies and operating procedures that conform to current technology and 
equipment.
4. Developing a forest product industry workforce.
i. Fund ﬁeld-related on-the-job training.
ii. Eliminate costly marking of trees by training harvesting operators in conducting operations  
based on designation by description (DxD). 
5. Create tax incentives for the forest product industry.
6. Create policies that ensure state resources (small diameter ponderosa pine) are used within the state 
(e.g. round guardrail posts manufactured for highways in Arizona).
Conclusion
From the outset, the WMSP faced many challenges and unknowns. A stewardship contract of its size and 
duration was unprecedented. In the beginning, the project was seen as a grand experiment with a diverse set of 
participants who had seen massive shifts in industry, land management, and forest health as well as in the socio-
political realm. Despite challenges, there were many successes. Acres were treated, treatments were tested and 
proved eﬀective in wildﬁre, and legal battles that typically delayed or halted progress never occurred.
With the WMSP, there was a fundamental shift from traditional timber extraction, where the primary goal is 
to maximize proﬁts, to ﬁre risk reduction, where the targets are improved forest health, increased community

protection, and enhanced ecosystem services. Te project also focused on minimizing costs and maximizing 
returns for small diameter wood utilization. However, private industry alone was unable to oﬀset treatment costs. 
Lessons learned presented in this report point to areas of improvement in the stewardship-industry model.      
Experiments bring uncertainty and challenges. But, reframing challenges as lessons learned and formulating 
pragmatic, applicable solutions can help fuel the progress of future forest restoration initiatives.
