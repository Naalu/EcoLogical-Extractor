Arizona, USA

To improve the knowledge of ecosystem dynamics within frequent-ﬁre forests and to develop targets for forest restoration, we dendrochronologically reconstructed four
1-ha plots within dry mixed-conifer forests in northern Arizona, USA. Forest densities in the study area increased from 139.8 live trees ha1, 10.26 m2 of basal area
ha1, and 14.9% canopy cover in 1879 (the assumed year of ﬁre exclusion) to 1,116.8 live trees ha1, 42.23 m2 of basal area ha1, and 55.3% canopy cover
in 2014. Shade-tolerant species also became more prevalent. Initial increases in tree density occurred near the established overstory or randomly throughout each stand,
rather than within canopy gaps. Tree spatial patterns were random or aggregated in 1879 and 88.3% of trees were isolated individuals or in groups of 2–4 trees.
Sprouting hardwoods and shade-tolerant conifers were more likely than other tree species to have been members of groups, whereas shade-intolerant conifers were
more likely to be isolated individuals. Relative shade tolerance and the reproductive strategies of component species contribute to ﬁne-scale spatial patterns in
mixed-species forests. This interaction between species silvics and ﬁne-scale spatial patterns is an important consideration for management activities targeting
heterogeneity and the natural ranges of variability in frequent-ﬁre forests.

efore the widespread Euro-American settlement of the south-
western United States (Arizona, New Mexico, southern Col-
orado; hereafter “Southwest”) in the late 1800s and concur-
rent disruption of natural disturbance regimes, many frequent-ﬁre
forests in the region had low tree densities (Covington and Moore
1994, Fule´ et al. 1997, Mast et al. 1999) and exhibited structural
heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales (Reynolds et al. 2013).
Across the landscape, forests probably had variable densities, seral
stages, and species compositions resulting from differences in dis-
turbance history, physical site characteristics, and seed availability
(Romme et al. 2009, Evans et al. 2011, Reynolds et al. 2013, p.
4–28). At the ﬁne-scale (4 ha extent), there was also considerable
variability. Forests had a mix of individual trees, groups of trees with
interlocking crowns, discrete openings, and grassy interspaces (Lar-
son and Churchill 2012, Reynolds et al. 2013, p. 4–28), and overall
patterns were aggregated, random, or uniform (Abella and Denton
2009). By understanding this heterogeneity, the natural ranges of
variability (NRV), and potential drivers of frequent-ﬁre regimes
(Huffman et al. 2015), management activities can better mimic the
natural ecology of forests in which ecological restoration and fuel
reduction are convergent goals (Keane et al. 2009, Larson and
Churchill 2012, Reynolds et al. 2013, p. 35–37).
In addition to an improved knowledge of the NRV, studies of
forest structure and spatial pattern can also provide a greater
understanding of historical disturbance dynamics (Thaxton and
Platt 2006, Fry and Stephens 2010), inter- and intraspeciﬁc
interactions (Mast and Wolf 2004), patch dynamics, and pat-
terns of recruitment (Mast and Veblen 1999, North et al. 2004,
Stephens and Fry 2005, Sa´nchez Meador et al. 2009). Ecological
patterns and processes are intimately intertwined (Turner 1989)
and forest density, species composition, and tree spatial pattern
are known to exert control over the understory environment

richness and productivity (Grifﬁs et al. 2001, Laughlin et al.
2006, Moore et al. 2006, Korb et al. 2007), tree recruitment
(Sa´nchez Meador et al. 2009, Bigelow et al. 2011), and water
availability (O’Hara and Nagel 2006, Dore et al. 2012).
Dry mixed-conifer forests cover approximately 12.9 Mha in the
western United States and 1.2 Mha in Utah and the Southwest
(Baker 2015). These forests provide important wildlife habitat
(Ganey and Balda 1989) and supply a multitude of ecosystem ser-
vices including watershed protection, carbon sequestration, and nu-
trient cycling (Evans et al. 2011, p. 38–40, Reynolds et al. 2013, p.
44–49). In the Southwest, dry mixed-conifer forests were histori-
cally dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum
Engelm.), although white ﬁr (Abies concolor var. concolor (Gordon)
Lindley ex Hildebrand), blue spruce (Picea pungens Engelm.),
southwestern white pine (Pinus strobiformis Engelm.), limber pine
(Pinus ﬂexilis E. James), aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), and/or
Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca [Mayr] Franco) are
often present (Romme et al. 2009, Evans et al. 2011, p. 3). Tree
mortality due to bark beetles (Dendroctonus and Ips spp.) and defo-
liating insects (e.g., Choristoneura freemani and Coloradia pandora)
was common in these forests historically (Hadley and Veblen 1993,
Swetnam and Lynch 1993) and remains important today (Dils et al.
2015). Dwarf mistletoes (Arceuthobium spp.) and root diseases (e.g.,
Armillaria solidipes) also occur within many southwestern mixed-co-
nifer forests (Dils et al. 2015). Fires historically burned at least 25%
of the landscape every 7–35 years within this cover type, but ﬁre
regimes were disrupted after Euro-American settlement in the late
1800s (Swetnam and Baisan 1996, O’Connor et al. 2014, Huffman
et al. 2015). Until the late 1800s, ﬁre played a crucial role in regu-
lating the structure of many southwestern dry mixed-conifer forests,
and thus conditions changed drastically over the 20th century (Fule´
et al. 2002, 2009, Heinlein et al. 2005).
Spatial patterns in frequent-ﬁre forests and the factors that drive
these patterns are poorly understood, but contribute to both the
structure and function of these ecosystems (Evans et al. 2011, p. 7,
Larson and Churchill 2012, Reynolds et al. 2013, p. 4–28). Knowl-
edge of spatial patterns and the NRV may enhance natural resource
conservation and restoration by allowing managers to better plan
silvicultural prescriptions at multiple spatial scales. The ecological
traits of individual species are known to have important roles in the
ﬁne-scale spatial structure of forests in the Southwest (Mast and
Wolf 2004, Sa´nchez Meador et al. 2009) and the Sierra Nevada
(Lutz et al. 2012, Lydersen et al. 2013) and probably relate to
relative shade tolerance in many other regions (Canham 1989).
However, in forests in the western United States, the interaction
between species composition and spatial pattern has only been ex-
plored in a small number of studies and merits further investigation.
In this study, we used dendrochronological reconstructions and
spatial analyses to quantify historical and contemporary tree densi-
ties, species compositions, and ﬁne-scale spatial patterns in dry
mixed-conifer forests of the Mogollon Rim, Arizona, USA. Our
three speciﬁc questions were the following: How do tree density,
species composition, and spatial pattern in four dry mixed-conifer
stands differ between 1879 and 2014? How do overstory tree species
differ with respect to spatial pattern? and How did species silvics and
the established overstory inﬂuence the patterns of tree recruitment
after ﬁre exclusion?
Methods
Study Area and Plot Selection
Our study area was within the Mogollon Rim Ranger District of
the Coconino National Forest in Arizona, USA. Elevation of the
study area is approximately 2,300 m, and annual precipitation av-
erages 845 mm (Western Regional Climate Center 2005). Annual
temperatures range from 7.5 to 27.8° C (January minimum and
July maximum, respectively) with diurnal variations of 15° C or
more (Western Regional Climate Center 2005). Soils on the site are
composed of cherty limestone and sandstone from the Kaibab for-
mation and are of high productivity (Natural Resources Conserva-
tion Service 2015). In the study area, the mean site index for Pseu-
dotsuga menziesii was 26.6 m with a base age of 100 years (SE  1.1,
n  31 site trees; following Edminster et al. 1991). Tree species
present on the site include white ﬁr, bigtooth maple (Acer grandi-
dentatum Nutt.), ponderosa pine, southwestern white pine, aspen,
Douglas-ﬁr, Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.), and New Mex-
ico locust (Robinia neomexicana A. Gray) (Table 1). US Department
of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service understory plant associations
for the study area were all of the white ﬁr series, and individual plots
had associations of spruceﬁr ﬂeabane, Oregon grape (typic and
RONE phases), and bigtooth maple (Stuever and Hayden 1997).
We selected plot locations subjectively in ArcGIS 10.1 (Environ-
mental Systems Research Institute 2011), from separate subwater-
sheds and at least 5 km apart. For plot selection, we used the follow-
ing criteria: (1) relatively moderate and homogeneous slopes
(30%), (2) south- or west-facing aspects (135–315°), (3) vegeta-
tive cover identiﬁed as “Rocky Mountain Dry-Mesic Montane
Mixed-Conifer Forest” in the SWReGAP data set (US Geological
Survey 2004), (4) at least 100 m from any designated trails or roads
(USDA Forest Service 2014), and (5) no overlap with perimeters of
recorded ﬁres from 1970 to 2014 (USDA Forest Service 2014). We
excluded areas that had burned recently because loss of historical

remnants through ﬁre and decomposition can affect the accuracy of
dendrochronological reconstructions (Fule´ et al. 2002).
Field Data Collection and Laboratory Methods
Field methods followed those used by Fule´ et al. (1997) and were
adapted for spatial analysis (Moore et al. 2004b, Sa´nchez Meador
et al. 2011). We established four 100  100-m square ﬁxed-area plots,
at least 2–5 times the expected size of tree patches (O’Neill et al.
1996, North et al. 2007, Reynolds et al. 2013, p. 6). On each plot,
we collected data for all live trees taller than 1.37 m and for every
historical remnant (stumps, logs, snags, or stump holes) greater than
20 cm or 15 cm in diameter (for conifers and hardwoods, respec-
tively). We determined size classes for data collection using a priori
runs of the Bakker et al. (2008) historical reconstruction model,
predicting that historical remnants smaller than these sizes were not
present before Euro-American settlement in the late 1800s. We
measured dbh (1.37 m aboveground level) for all live trees and
diameter at stump height (0.4 m aboveground level) for all historical
remnants. For each tree and remnant, we identiﬁed species and
recorded condition class following Maser et al. (1979). We also
determined the spatial location of all live trees and historical rem-
nants using an Impulse 200LR laser rangeﬁnder and Mapstar com-
pass module (Laser Technology, Inc.), with accuracy within 0.05 m
and 0.1°, respectively.
We identiﬁed live trees that could have predated Euro-American
settlement using size cutoffs (hardwoods of 20 cm dbh; conifers of
40 cm dbh), limb structure, and bark characteristics (Fule´ et al.
1997). For all trees potentially predating Euro-American settlement
and for a random sample of other trees (10% of Abies concolor and
20% of all other species), we collected increment cores at 40 cm
above ground level (Fule´ et al. 1997, Sa´nchez Meador et al. 2009).
We sampled age data from Abies concolor at a lower rate than that for
other species because of its widespread abundance on each plot. We
mounted, surfaced, and visually cross-dated (with an established
chronology) all increment cores in the laboratory according to stan-
dard dendrochronological techniques (Stokes and Smiley 1968). If
increment cores were partially rotten or did not intersect tree pith,
we estimated the number of rings to pith using a transparent esti-
mator sheet (Applequist 1958). For all analyses, we excluded cores
that were greater than 10 rings from pith (n  342). Of 1,204
increment cores collected in the ﬁeld, 862 were included in the
analyses.
Data Analysis
Tree Density, Species Composition, and Age Structure
We reconstructed stand structure, species composition, and spa-
tial pattern using the historical reconstruction model of Bakker et al.
(2008). In brief, Bakker et al. (2008) outline methods that use live
and dead (stumps, snags, logs, and others) tree morphological char-
acteristics combined with increment cores to determine tree age,
with species-speciﬁc basal area increment, tree allometry, and snag
and log decomposition equations to determine the historical status
(live or dead) and size of all trees sampled before a speciﬁed date. For
all analyses, we estimated forest conditions in 1879, the year of
widespread ﬁre exclusion in the area (Huffman et al. 2015), assum-
ing that this was the time at which forest structure and processes
began to deviate from the NRV. In addition, we reconstructed forest
conditions for 1910 (30 years after ﬁre exclusion) to quantify the
spatial relationships between tree recruitment and established over-
story trees in the ﬁrst cohort after ﬁre exclusion. When the center
ring of increment cores predated 1879, we used the proportional
reconstruction method described by Bakker (2005) to determine
tree size in 1879. For trees without age data and for all historical
remnants, we predicted historical tree size using species-speciﬁc
backgrowth models based on basal area increment. These methods
of historical stand reconstruction are further described by Bakker
(2005) and Bakker et al. (2008).
The accuracy of the reconstruction model depends on input
parameters of growth rate, decomposition percentile (rate of decom-
position of historical remnants), and cut dates (years of harvest)
(Moore et al. 2004a). We estimated growth rates from increment
cores collected on our plots and other sites across the Southwest. We
also selected the 25th percentile of decomposition (slower than
average), based on ﬁndings from a study of permanent plots
within dry mixed-conifer stands in western New Mexico (Moore
et al. 2004a, p. 17–19). Last, we assigned cut dates to individual
stumps with the assumption that two timber harvests occurred
on the plots.
Signiﬁcant growth releases on cores taken from our plots oc-
curred in 1910, 1969, and 1988 (O’Reilly et al. 2015), but only the
1969 and 1988 releases correspond with periods of widespread tim-
ber harvests on the Mogollon Rim (B. Greco, Ecological Restoration
Institute, pers. comm., Nov. 15, 2014). Although harvests in other
forests of northern Arizona occurred in the early 1900s, the ﬁrst
lumber mills in close proximity to our study area were constructed in
the 1950s (B. Greco, Ecological Restoration Institute, pers. comm.,
Nov. 15, 2014). In addition, there was no evidence of older stumps
harvested using crosscut saws on our plots, as is common in other
sites in northern Arizona (K.C. Rodman, University of Colorado at
Boulder, pers. observ., May 20, 2014). Thus, the 1910 release can be
attributed to another factor such as increased moisture availability
(Swetnam and Betancourt 1998, Brown and Wu 2005) or insect-
related mortality. Harvests on the Mogollon Rim in the 1960s pri-
marily focused on trees larger than 20 cm dbh (US General Ac-
counting Ofﬁce 1972), and harvests in the 1980s did not remove
trees greater than 55 cm dbh (B. Greco, Ecological Restoration
Institute, pers. comm., May 12, 2015). Therefore, we assigned a cut
date of 1968 for all stumps greater than 55 cm dbh equivalent and a
cut date of 1987 for stumps less than 20 cm dbh equivalent, 1 year
before growth releases (O’Reilly et al. 2015). We randomly assigned
all stumps of intermediate size (20–55 cm dbh) to one of the two cut
dates. We also performed a sensitivity analysis for the reconstruction
model by altering growth rates (5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles),
decomposition rates (10th, 25th, and 50th percentiles), and years of
timber harvests (1968 only and 1987 only) and removing tree center
dates and actual growth rates from the model inputs (Supplemental
Table 1).
Using these models, we calculated the mean number of live trees
ha1, the amount of live basal area ha1, and the percentage of
canopy cover in 1879 and 2014 for all trees taller than 1.37 m. We
estimated canopy cover (the proportion of the total plot area covered
by measured or estimated tree crowns; following Tuten et al. 2015).
When not measured (and for all historical trees), we estimated
crown size using species-speciﬁc nonlinear regressions of diameter at

stump height to crown radius (Rodman 2015, p. 173). We exam-
ined changes in species composition using a variation of ecological
importance value (EIV), a measure of relative species dominance on
a site (Curtis and McIntosh 1951). Our formula for EIV was
EIV (X) 
no. live trees of species X
no. live trees of all species  100

live basal area for species X
live basal area for all species  100
where X is the target species of analysis and EIV is the ecological
importance value for species X on a given plot. We also created an
age distribution for live trees on all plots by multiplying the number
of successfully dated trees originating in a given decade by their
expansion factor (i.e., expanding the actual number of trees sampled
to their estimated density per hectare). Speciﬁcally, we computed an
expansion factor using the sampling rate of differing tree sizes and
species to account for differences in observed sampling rates. We did
not correct for the time needed to grow to 40 cm in height, which
varies by species and by site. Pinus ponderosa seedlings can take 4–19
years to grow to this height near our study area (Puhlick et al. 2013).
On the San Francisco Peaks in northern Arizona, Abies concolor
height growth may be relatively similar to that of Pinus ponderosa
but Pseudotsuga menziesii and Pinus strobiformis probably grow
slower, taking 14–25 years to grow to 40 cm in height (Heinlein
et al. 2005). Less is known about other species.
Univariate and Bivariate Spatial Analysis and Spatial Autocorrelation
We performed spatial analyses for (1) trees of all species com-
bined, (2) Abies concolor, (3) conifer species with intermediate ﬁre
and shade tolerance (Pinus strobiformis and Pseudotsuga menziesii),
(4) Pinus ponderosa, and (5) hardwoods (Acer grandidentatum, Quer-
cus gambelii, Populus tremuloides, and Robinia neomexicana) (here-
after “species groups”). We grouped species for these analyses be-
cause of their relatively similar ecological traits (Burns and Honkala
1990a, 1990b). For example, all hardwoods on our plots reproduce,
in part, by sprouting or suckering (Table 1). Pooling species also
helps to overcome sample size limitations without excluding mini-
mally represented species from the analysis.
As a measure of average spatial patterns across the study area, we
performed replicated (sensu Sa´nchez Meador and Moore 2010, Lar-
son et al. 2012, Tuten et al. 2015) Ripley’s K analyses of spatial
patterns for each species group across all plots (Besag 1977, Ripley
1977) and excluded any plots with fewer than 20 trees in a given
species group. We performed these analyses at lag distances of 0 to
50 m with 1-m intervals and used isotropic edge correction to ac-
count for uncertainty beyond plot perimeters (Ripley 1988). We
performed 999 Monte Carlo simulations of complete spatial ran-
domness (CSR) to develop 95% conﬁdence envelopes and deter-
mined statistically signiﬁcant deviations from CSR using the Diggle,
Cressie, Loosmore, and Ford (DCLF) goodness of ﬁt test (Loosmore
and Ford 2006). For the DCLF test, we used a one-tailed test be-
tween 0 and 30 m, corresponding to the range of reported patch
sizes in southwestern ponderosa pine forests (Reynolds et al. 2013,
p. 6) and other dry mixed-conifer forests in the western United
States (North et al. 2007, Matonis et al. 2013). For any patterns
demonstrating signiﬁcant aggregation (  0.05), we also ﬁt a
model of a Mate´rn cluster process to each plot-level point pattern of
tree stems (using minimum contrast methods) (Mate´rn 1960, Bad-
deley et al. 2014). The extraction of parameters from the ﬁtted
model allows for the unbiased estimation of mean patch sizes (Bad-
deley et al. 2014). Although the paired correlation function has seen
increased use recently, the use of Ripley’s K analysis was better
aligned with our research objectives and facilitates comparison to a
greater number of published studies (Larson and Churchill 2012).
We also performed Ripley’s bivariate K analyses for each species
group (Lotwick and Silverman 1982) to understand relative attrac-
tion and inhibition between 1879 overstory trees and the ﬁrst cohort
of recruitment (1879–1910) at multiple scales. We developed 95%
conﬁdence envelopes for these analyses using 999 random shifts of
recruited trees relative to the 1879 overstory (Goreaud and Pe´lissier
2003) and tested for signiﬁcant interaction between the two types of
points using the two-tailed variation of the DCLF test (Loosmore
and Ford 2006) at scales of 0–30 m. The upper extent of this range
is equal to the 95th percentile height measurement in our observed
data.
To analyze bivariate relationships between species groups, we
performed a Monte Carlo permutation test (999 simulations) of the
join count statistic (Cliff and Ord 1981). Use of this analysis helps to
determine whether members of a given species are spatially segre-
gated from other species (signiﬁcant autocorrelation). We deter-
mined statistical signiﬁcance for all Ripley’s K and join count anal-
yses by pooling each plot-level analysis or goodness-of-ﬁt test using
Stouffer’s Z-score method (Rosenthal 1995). For these spatial anal-
yses, we used the spatstat (Baddeley and Turner 2005) and spdep
packages (Bivand 2014) in the R environment (R Core Team 2014).
Delineation of Groups
The proportion of trees in groups and as isolated individuals and
the range of group sizes provide a description of ﬁne-scale heteroge-
neity that is lacking in many previous studies (Larson and Churchill
2012). Because the ecological deﬁnition of a tree group is at least two
adjacent trees with interlocking crowns (Sa´nchez Meador et al.
2011, Larson and Churchill 2012), we used measured or estimated
crown radii to determine group membership for each tree present in
the 1879 reconstruction and all live trees in the observed data in
2014 (Lydersen et al. 2013). When this method of group delinea-
tion is used, the analyst projects circular buffered polygons centered
on the spatial location of each tree, where the polygon radius is based
on measured or estimated crown radius. If overlap occurs between
adjacent crown polygons, trees are considered to be of the same
group. To correct for edge effects, we used a reduced sample method
(similar to Lydersen et al. 2013) with an interior buffer of 10.6 m
within the plot boundary. This distance corresponds to the maxi-
mum observed crown radius measurement on any tree on the plots
and reduces the impact of tree crowns outside the plot perimeter
that may encroach into the plot boundary. To be included in the
ﬁnal tally, an individual tree crown had to be within the buffered
plot area. Tree groups were also removed from the analysis if they
were not, at least partially, within the buffered plot area.
We combined results of group delineation into three distinct size
classes: single trees, small groups (2–4 trees), and large groups (5
trees). Large groups were the same size or greater than the largest
historical mean group sizes reported in Sa´nchez Meador et al. (2011)
and Lydersen et al. (2013). Next, we used 2 contingency analysis to
compare the observed number of trees (for a given species in a given
size class) to the expected number of trees under the null hypothesis
of no interaction between species and group size. We performed
these analyses for live trees in each species group in 1879 and 2014

and did not correct for multiple comparisons. When contingency
analysis revealed statistical signiﬁcance (  0.05), we also per-
formed post hoc analysis by comparing standardized Pearson resid-
uals to the critical threshold of the distribution (where   0.05),
thereby determining if the deviation was different from the expected
value for each cell in the matrix. We performed these post hoc
analyses using the polytomous package (Arppe 2013) in R (R Core
Team 2014).
Results
How Do Tree Density, Species Composition, and Spatial Pattern
in Four Dry Mixed-Conifer Stands Differ between 1879 and
2014?
Tree density increased markedly on our plots between 1879 and
2014 (Figure 1; Table 2). In 1879, estimated densities were 139.8
live trees ha1 (SE  17.5) and 10.26 m2 of basal area ha1 (SE 
0.86). In 2014, observed densities were 1,116.8 live trees ha1
(SE  185.1) and 42.3 m2 of basal area ha1 (SE  1.81). For
1879, we estimate that canopy cover was 14.9% (SE  3.9) and that
it increased to 55.3% (SE  2.3) in 2014. Sensitivity analysis for the
reconstruction (Bakker et al. 2008) revealed that the model was
relatively robust to changes in input parameters, and all predicted
densities for 1879 were substantially lower than the observed values
in 2014. Variations in model input parameters led to predicted
1879 densities that ranged from 92.3 to 144 live trees ha1 and from
6.2 to 13.6 m2 of basal area ha1.
As stand density increased, so did the relative dominance of
ﬁre-intolerant and shade-tolerant species (Figures 1 and 2).
Ponderosa pine was the most dominant species in 1879 (mean
EIV  97.2, SE  19.8), followed by Gambel oak (EIV  31.8,
SE  13.4), white ﬁr (EIV  29.6, SE  5.8), and Douglas-ﬁr
(EIV  22.3, SE  2.3). Southwestern white pine (EIV  11.2,
SE  9.6), aspen (EIV  6.5, SE  5.4), bigtooth maple (EIV 
1.2, SE  1.2), and New Mexico locust (EIV  0.2, SE  0.2) were
relatively minor components of stand structure, and the prevalence
of these species varied among plots. In 2014, stand structure was
dominated by a mixture of Douglas-ﬁr (EIV  66.5, SE  18.2),
white ﬁr (EIV  64.5, SE  6.8), and ponderosa pine (EIV  35.7,
SE  14.9), with minor components of Gambel oak (EIV  13.4,
SE  6.8), southwestern white pine (EIV  8.7, SE  4.3), big-
tooth maple (EIV  6.0, SE  6.0), New Mexico locust (EIV 
4.5, SE  3.7), and aspen (EIV  0.6, SE  0.3). Between 1879
and 2014, all species (with the exception of aspen) showed numer-
ical increases in live tree density (Table 2).
Stands in 2014 were relatively young. In the standing age distri-
bution, 96.1% of all live trees postdated 1879, the assumed year of
ﬁre exclusion (Figure 1i). Shortly after 1879, early-seral and shade-
intolerant species (e.g., ponderosa pine) successfully regenerated at
high numbers and between 1900 and 1920, recruitment of Doug-
las-ﬁr and white ﬁr also increased. After timber harvests in the 1960s
and 1980s, shade-intolerant recruitment appears to have increased.
There were an average of 105.8 cut stumps ha1 on our plots, and
ponderosa pine (45.6% of the total), Douglas-ﬁr (28.4%) and white
ﬁr (22.7%) were the most intensively harvested. Gambel oak (2.8%)
and southwestern white pine (0.5%) were cut in small numbers.
The mean diameter of stumps was highest for ponderosa pine (40.3
cm), Gambel oak (37.0 cm), and white ﬁr (33.5 cm) and was lower
for Douglas-ﬁr (29.8 cm) and southwestern white pine (24.5 cm).
In 1879, the spatial pattern of all live trees exhibited a trend
toward aggregation, especially at scales of 0–5 m but did not signif-
icantly deviate from CSR based on combined plot-level goodness-
of-ﬁt tests (P  0.10) (Figure 3a). Plots also demonstrated consid-
erable variation. Plots with higher historical densities, lower
proportions of ponderosa pine, and higher mean site indices ap-
peared to show greater relative aggregation and larger patch sizes
(e.g., East Barbershop and Hi Fuller; Rodman 2015), although we
performed no statistical analyses relating to these factors. In 2014,
overall spatial patterns were signiﬁcantly aggregated (P  0.01),
primarily with small mean patch areas (mean  0.030 ha, SE 
0.008 ha) (Figure 3b), probably driven by dense groups of tree
recruitment.
How Do Overstory Tree Species Differ with Respect to Spatial
Pattern?
Species groups demonstrated differing spatial patterns at multi-
ple scales, but all species groups were random or aggregated (Figure
3). White ﬁr exhibited increasing aggregation from 0 to 5 m and
again from 15 to 25 m in 1879 and was signiﬁcantly aggregated
based on goodness-of-ﬁt tests (P  0.01) (Figure 3d). White ﬁr
patterns were also aggregated in 2014 (P  0.01), especially at scales
of 0–3 m (Figure 3e). Intermediate conifers (Douglas-ﬁr and south-
western white pine) were not signiﬁcantly different from CSR in
1879 (composite P  0.16; Figure 3g), but demonstrated signiﬁcant
aggregation in 2014 (P  0.01; Figure 3h). Similarly, patterns of
ponderosa pine did not deviate from CSR in 1879 (P  0.18; Figure
3j), but were signiﬁcantly aggregated in 2014 (P  0.01; Figure 3k).
Hardwood species showed signiﬁcant aggregation in 1879 (P 
0.03; Figure 3m), and although the average pattern of hardwoods
did not demonstrate signiﬁcant aggregation in 2014 (P  0.09), 2 of
3 plots included in this analysis were highly aggregated (Figure 3n).
Join count analysis revealed that species groups differed with
respect to their level of spatial autocorrelation (deﬁned here as the
tendency to grow in close proximity to individuals of the same
species). Of the species analyzed, white ﬁr individuals were the least
likely to exhibit autocorrelation by species, suggesting that individ-
uals of this species readily intermix with individuals of other species.
This relationship did not appear to change over time (1879, P 
0.28; 2014, P  0.35). Intermediate conifers exhibited relatively
strong autocorrelation in 1879 (P  0.12) and were signiﬁcantly
autocorrelated in 2014 (P  0.01). Ponderosa pine demonstrated
no signiﬁcant spatial autocorrelation in 1879 (P  0.12) or 2014
(P  0.23). Hardwoods showed the strongest evidence of spatial
autocorrelation of any species group in 1879 (P  0.08) and were
signiﬁcantly autocorrelated in 2014 (P  0.03), suggesting a ten-
dency to grow in groups with other hardwoods.
Between 1879 and 2014, the percentage of trees in large groups
and average group size both increased (Supplemental Table 2). In
1879, most trees were individuals (not having interlocking crowns
with adjacent trees) or in small groups (2–4 adjacent trees with
interlocking crowns; mean group size  1.5 trees, SE  0.06, max-
imum  9 trees). However, the majority of trees were in large
groups (5 or more trees with interlocking crowns; mean  8.7 trees,
SE  2.0, maximum  590) in 2014, consistent with increases in
tree density. Whereas 11.7% of all trees and 15.8% of total basal
area were in large groups in 1879, 87.7% of trees and 90.7% of basal
area were in large groups in 2014.
2 contingency analysis indicated that the number of trees as
individuals, small groups, and large groups deviated signiﬁcantly

from expected values in 1879 (2  41.0, P  0.01) and in 2014
(2  41.5, P  0.01) and that individual species had an important role
in ﬁne-scale spatial structure. Post hoc analysis (Table 3) revealed
that white ﬁr were signiﬁcantly less likely to be found as isolated
individuals (in 2014 only) or in small groups (1879 and 2014) and
were signiﬁcantly more likely to be found in large groups than other
species (1879 and 2014). Intermediate conifers did not deviate from
expected values in either 1879 or 2014. Ponderosa pine were more
commonly found as single trees or in smaller groups than other
species and were signiﬁcantly less likely to be in large groups, both

historically and contemporarily. In 1879, hardwood species were
less likely to grow as isolated individuals and more likely to grow in
large groups than other species, although no signiﬁcant relationships
existed for this species group in 2014 (Table 3).
How Did Species Silvics and the Established Overstory Inﬂuence
the Patterns of Tree Recruitment after Fire Exclusion?
As shown in Figure 3c, f, i, l, and o, tree recruitment in the ﬁrst
cohort after the assumed year of ﬁre exclusion (trees dating
1879–1910) was either attracted to or randomly distributed among
existing overstory trees (from the 1879 reconstruction); however,
this relationship appears to have varied by species and plot. White ﬁr
recruitment occurred near the established overstory at 0–10 m on all
plots, although this trend was not statistically signiﬁcant (P  0.28;
Figure 3f). Recruitment of intermediate conifers occurred away
from the 1879 overstory at 0–3 m but was random beyond this
distance (P  0.51; Figure 3i). Ponderosa pine showed a similar
trend of minor repulsion at 0–5 m, but no substantial trend beyond
this distance (P  0.23; Figure 3l), and results varied among plots.
Similar to white ﬁr, hardwoods appear to have successfully regener-
ated in close proximity to the established overstory, especially at
scales of 0–5 m, but not signiﬁcantly so (P  0.14; Figure 3o).
Grassy interspaces do not appear to have been especially beneﬁcial to
the recruitment of any species from 1879 to 1910.
Discussion
Changes in Structure and Composition
Our results corroborated those of several other studies and indi-
cated that densities have increased and species composition has
shifted in many dry mixed-conifer forests in the Southwest since
widespread Euro-American settlement (Fule´ et al. 2002, 2009,
Heinlein et al. 2005). For example, Reynolds et al. (2013, p. 28)
reported ranges of 51.6–245.6 live trees ha1, 9.1–28.4 m2 of basal
area ha1, and 12.9–21.5% canopy cover from dendrochronologi-
cal reconstructions and historical plot data in other southwestern
dry mixed-conifer forests in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Using
General Land Ofﬁce records, Williams and Baker (2012) also re-
ported mean densities of 141.5 and 144.2 trees ha1 on the Mog-
ollon Plateau and Black Mesa, Arizona, two landscapes adjacent to
our sites. Our mean estimates of 1879 forest structure ﬁt within
these established ranges. However, in 2014, all plots we analyzed
had much higher densities than the historical ranges from Reynolds
et al. (2013) and Williams and Baker (2012).
In other historical reconstructions in the Southwest, white ﬁr and
Douglas-ﬁr had combined EIVs of 33–66 in approximately the late
1800s/early 1900s and EIVs of 94–107 in approximately the late
1900s/early 2000s, suggesting substantial increases in relative dom-
inance over this time period (Fule´ et al. 2002, 2009, Heinlein et al.
2005). Ponderosa pine had EIVs ranging from 111 to 128 in ap-
proximately the late 1800s/early 1900s and from 44 to 65 in ap-
proximately the late 1900s/early 2000s (Fu´le et al. 2002, 2009,

relative dominance by a given species, and lower EIVs indicate lower relative dominance (see Methods for further details). EIVs are the
mean for our plots (n  4), error bars are 1 SE, and data are for trees taller than 1.37 m. Tones for each species are scaled by relative

Second-order point pattern analyses for plots (n  4) in dry mixed-conifer forests on the Mogollon Rim, Arizona, USA. L
transformations of Ripley’s univariate K analyses are presented for each site in 1879 (a, d, g, j, and m) and 2014 (b, e, h, k, and n). Solid
lines are the pooled patterns across all plots, dashed lines are the patterns in individual plots, and shaded areas are 95% conﬁdence
envelopes for CSR. Deviations above the conﬁdence envelope suggest aggregation at a given scale, and deviations below the envelope
suggest uniformity at a given scale. Also shown are bivariate analyses (c, f, i, l, and o) of the relationships between reconstructed overstory
and tree recruitment between 1879 and 1910. Deviations above the envelope indicate attraction between overstory and recruitment, and
deviations below the envelope indicate repulsion at a given scale. n(i) is the number of overstory trees in the analysis, and n(j) is the
number of trees that successfully regenerated between 1879 and 1910 (i.e., “First Cohort”). DCLF P values are the results of goodness-of-ﬁt
tests comparing the observed pattern to a null hypothesis of CSR or no interaction between overstory and recruitment. Mean Patch Area
(given in mean SE of plots) is based on the mean patch radius parameter from Mate´rn cluster models (see Methods for further details).

Heinlein et al. 2005), a notable decrease in dominance after wide-
spread ﬁre exclusion. These changes were also evident on our plots
on the Mogollon Rim. Although previous studies suggest that
southwestern white pine and limber pine have increased in domi-
nance relative to historical levels (Heinlein et al. 2005, Huffman
et al. 2015), increases in dominance of southwestern white pine
were less dramatic. Similarly, aspen decline has occurred in many
areas of the Southwest over the last century (Heinlein et al. 2005,
Fairweather et al. 2008, Vankat 2011), but this was not readily
apparent in our study area. Although some generalizations can be
made regarding shifts in species composition, these changes vary
among sites.
Timber harvests may have also led to changes in species compo-
sition, size structure, and age structure on our plots. Harvests of
many large ponderosa pine were evident. However, peaks in recruit-
ment of ponderosa pine were also concurrent with estimated years of
timber harvests on our plots. These ﬁndings suggest that seed
sources or advanced regeneration of Pinus ponderosa were still pres-
ent after harvests and that resource availability is an important factor
limiting species composition contemporarily. New Mexico locust
also peaked in recruitment after harvests, and this species is known
to respond quickly to gaps in the tree canopy (USDA Forest Service
2015).
Greater interannual variability in ENSO (the El Nin˜o/Southern
Oscillation) led to an increase in ﬁre frequency in the Southwest
from 1830 to 1860 (Swetnam and Betancourt 1998). This factor
could have led to lower than average densities and shifts toward
ﬁre-tolerant species in the time to which we reconstructed (1879).
The year 1879 was also a year of widespread ﬁre occurrence in the
Southwest (Swetnam and Baisan 1996) and speciﬁcally on the Mog-
ollon Rim (Huffman et al. 2015). Undoubtedly, tree density and
species composition ﬂuctuated over time in these ecosystems, but
135 years without widespread ﬁre occurrence across much of the
landscape is outside the NRV in most southwestern dry mixed-co-
nifer forests (Swetnam and Baisan 1996, O’Connor et al. 2014,
Huffman et al. 2015). Thus, current structural conditions and eco-
logical processes are probably outside the NRV in many dry mixed-
conifer forests in the Southwest.
Historical and contemporary spatial patterns in our study area
were random or aggregated. Similar to the ﬁndings of Matonis et al.
(2013), our results indicate that both of these types of patterns
existed historically in dry mixed-conifer forests on the Mogollon
Rim. Random patterns can occur on productive sites with no sub-
stantial barriers to tree regeneration (Schneider et al. 2016) or on
sites that experience extreme drought stress (e.g., black cinder soils;
Abella and Denton 2009). On the other hand, aggregated forest
structures may result from beneﬁcial microsites or patch formation
occurring in open areas of bare mineral soil after disturbance (Ste-
phens and Fry 2005, Sa´nchez Meador et al. 2009). There is also
considerable variety within each ecosystem (Abella and Denton
2009). In dry mixed-conifer forests, differences in these patterns
could relate to differences in site productivity and species composi-
tion, but further analysis is needed to quantify these factors (sensu
Abella and Denton 2009). Still, our ﬁndings provide strong evi-
dence that relative species composition on a site contributes to these
patterns. Fine-scale spatial patterns on our sites aligned with the
models of spatial structure described by Larson and Churchill
(2012) and Reynolds et al. (2013). Individual trees, small tree
groups, large tree groups, and grassy interspaces all appear to have
been important to the ﬁne-scale historical structure of dry mixed-
conifer forests on the Mogollon Rim.
Species Composition and Spatial Pattern
Although tree density and community composition have shifted in
many dry mixed-conifer forests in the Southwest, the patterns of indi-
vidual species at our site remained largely similar over the last 135
years.Spatialpatternispartiallyreﬂectiveofthenichespaceoccupiedby
each species in a community (Mast and Wolf 2004, Lydersen et al.
2013, this study) and varies with overstory species composition.
As hypothesized by Huffman et al. (2015), our results provide
evidence that white ﬁr was able to persist in some southwestern
frequent-ﬁre forests because of the effects of ﬁne-scale heterogeneity.
On our site, this species trended toward membership in large groups
and was intermixed with other species. Protected microsites are
known to be beneﬁcial to the establishment of this species (Burns
and Honkala 1990a) and could have been provided by the estab-
lished overstory and early-seral species. For example, patches of
smaller and younger white ﬁr often overlap with larger and older
ponderosa pine (Mast et al. 2004), and this species also trends to-
ward group membership in other mixed-conifer forests (Lydersen
et al. 2013). Established tree groups could have altered ﬁne-scale ﬁre
behavior (Stephens and Fry 2005), thus facilitating the growth of
late-seral species, but this relationship merits further study.
Of the species analyzed, ponderosa pine were most likely to be
found as individual trees and least likely to be members of large
groups. This result was expected because ponderosa pine is shade
intolerant (Bigelow et al. 2011). However, this species also appeared
to exist in close proximity to trees of other species, probably because
other trees (e.g., white ﬁr) were establishing beneath pine or because
light may not have limited tree establishment historically.
Deciduous hardwoods (aspen, bigtooth maple, Gambel oak, and
New Mexico locust) showed spatial aggregation on our sites and
were likely to grow in large single-species groups, both historically
and contemporarily. Sa´nchez Meador and Moore (2010) demon-
strated that Gambel oak and ponderosa pine were spatially segre-
gated in pine-oak stands in northern Arizona, and this relationship
was also apparent on our plots. Based on join count analyses, hard-
woods and conifers were spatially segregated within each plot in our
study area. Sprouting species often regenerate in close proximity to
the established overstory because of clonality (e.g., Strauss 1975,
Ripley 1977), and this mechanism may explain the tendency toward
spatial aggregation and group membership.

Patterns of Recruitment
The spatial patterns of tree recruitment can help to predict the
outcomes of future management actions and provide insight into an
important ecological process (Sa´nchez Meador et al. 2009). On our
site, canopy gaps were not especially beneﬁcial to tree recruitment in
the ﬁrst cohort after assumed ﬁre regime disruption (1879–1910).
Rather, initial increases in density after 1879 occurred randomly or
in close proximity to the established overstory. Possible mechanisms
for these patterns are the mortality of seedlings in openings due to
pathogens and insects (Dils et al. 2015) or competition with the
herbaceous understory (Puhlick et al. 2012). Our ﬁndings are con-
sistent with those for mixed-conifer forests in other regions in the
western United States (North et al. 2004) and contrast with ﬁndings
in ponderosa pine or pine-oak (ponderosa pine/Gambel oak) forests
in the Southwest (Sa´nchez Meador et al. 2009). These results are
surprising given the relative proximity of our study locations to
those of Sa´nchez Meador et al. (2009) and suggest that local site
characteristics and variations in species composition affect the spa-
tial patterns of recruitment within frequent-ﬁre forests.
Study Limitations and Future Work
The destruction or decomposition of historical remnants, site
selection, sample size limitations, and the uncertainty of the ages of
stumps, logs, and snags provide the major limitations to our study.
The loss of remnants due to management activities could affect
reconstructions (Fule´ et al. 1997), but harvesting at our site proba-
bly did not take place earlier than the late 1960s (B. Greco, Ecolog-
ical Restoration Institute, pers. comm., Nov. 15, 2014). Indeed,
most stumps present on our plots showed very little evidence of
decay. Other studies also suggest that remnants of conifers persist for
long periods of time in these forests (e.g., Mast et al. 1999). In
ponderosa pine forests in northern Arizona, Huffman et al. (2001)
reported that only 6% of historical trees (1909–1913) could not be
located with methods similar to those used in our study. Still, the
loss of remnants may lead to underestimations of historical densities,
especially in smaller size classes that decompose more quickly. Thus,
uncertainty is greater for historical trees in smaller size classes. In
addition, hardwoods may decompose more rapidly than conifers
(Vankat 2011, Matonis et al. 2013), and certain conifers may de-
compose more quickly than others (e.g., white ﬁr; North et al.
2007). Variations in decomposition rates may lead to bias in histor-
ical reconstructions (Fule´ et al. 1997, Huffman et al. 2001, North
et al. 2007, Matonis et al. 2013), and more rapid decomposition of
certain species (e.g., white ﬁr and aspen) could lead to underesti-
mates of densities for these species relative to other species that
might decompose more slowly (e.g., ponderosa pine). Studies of
interspeciﬁc variations in decomposition rates and loss of remnants
are an important area for future research. To reduce the likelihood of
the loss of historical remnants, we selected sites that had not expe-
rienced ﬁre since 1970. Therefore, our results may be skewed toward
areas that have experienced relatively greater shifts in structure and
composition.
Sample size (n  4 plots) and the limited geographic range of this
study do not allow us to make broad generalizations regarding his-
torical conditions in dry mixed-conifer forests of the western United
States. However, many of the species studied have widespread geo-
graphic ranges in western North America, and our ﬁndings provide
insight into the relationship between species composition and spa-
tial pattern in these systems. Additional research should be con-
ducted in ponderosa pine, pine-oak, and dry mixed-conifer forests
in the western United States to develop a greater understanding of
the NRV of these ecosystems at multiple spatial scales. Studies along
climatic gradients or using climate analog sites (sensu Churchill et
al. 2013) may be especially useful.
Sampling and cross-dating historical remnants (i.e., stumps, logs,
and snags) is difﬁcult; therefore, our reconstruction methods used
models of basal area increment and decomposition to supplement
dendrochronological reconstructions. For this reason, there may be
greater uncertainty associated with historical remnants than with
live trees. However, our sensitivity analysis revealed that the removal
of increment core data changed estimated stand densities by only
8% in the number of live trees and 9% in basal area relative to the
presented results. Therefore, age data for live trees did not substan-
tially affect model results in terms of density. Still, dendrochrono-
logical sampling of some snags, logs, and/or stumps may allow for
model veriﬁcation and validation in future research (sensu Mast et
al. 1999). Our results did not deviate substantially from the results
reported in previous studies (Reynolds et al. 2013, p. 28), and other
work suggests that the methods used in this study are well founded
(Huffman et al. 2001, Moore et al. 2004b). A greater knowledge of
the effectiveness of these methods in mixed-species forests may
prove useful, especially because historical reconstructions have be-
come prevalent in mixed-species forests in other regions in the west-
ern United States (Larson and Churchill 2012).
Conclusions
Between 1879 and 2014, forest densities in our study area in-
creased, and species composition shifted to a greater relative propor-
tion of shade-tolerant and ﬁre-intolerant species. We also deter-
mined that ﬁne-scale patterns in dry mixed-conifer forests on the
Mogollon Rim, Arizona, USA, were both random and aggregated
historically, and probably varied based on site-speciﬁc factors. In
1879, tree group sizes were small but shifted to larger contiguous
tree groups in 2014. Initial increases in tree density were randomly
located throughout the stand or in close proximity to the established
overstory, and grassy interspaces may have inhibited tree recruit-
ment in 1879–1910. We also found that the silvics of individual
tree species play an important role in maintaining ﬁne-scale heter-
ogeneity in mixed-species forests and are thus an important consid-
eration for land managers when planning silvicultural treatments.
Shade-tolerant species can establish in the environment created by
larger tree groups and were found to intermix with other species.
Shade-intolerant species often grew as isolated single trees or in
groups of 2–4 trees in these stands. Sprouting hardwoods occupied
separate sites from conifers and tended to grow in groups with other
hardwoods, not as isolated individuals.
Site-speciﬁc restoration treatments may not be feasible under the
projections of future environmental conditions (Millar et al. 2007),
and restoration and fuels reduction are not convergent goals across
all forests of the western United States (Schoennagel et al. 2004), but
a knowledge of the NRV can contribute to a management frame-
work that targets long-term ecosystem resistance and resilience to
disturbance and ensures that management is aligned with ecology
(Keane et al. 2009, Reynolds et al. 2013). Metrics quantifying his-
torical forest structure, the roles of individual species within it, and
the ways that these factors vary both spatially and temporally all
provide important information that can be used by managers and
will aid in the conservation of these important ecosystems.
