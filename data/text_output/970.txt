ense, small-diameter stands have
been viewed as a major issue associated
with wild forest fires in the Interior
Northwest of the United States. A dense
understory is present throughout these
forests as a result of successful fire sup-
pression in the past. These stands gener-
ally require thinning from below in order
to improve fire-tolerance through sil-
vicultural methods. Thinning treatments
are also used to create a stand that more
closely represents the historical stand in
terms of species composition, spacing,
and structural arrangement.
Mechanical harvesting removes small-
and medium-sized trees, leaving large
amounts of dry untreated fuels on the
ground, which increases both fire risk
and intensity. To insure that a thinning
operation reduces fire risk for the re-
maining forest, the operation must either
remove sub-merchantable size trees and
logging slash completely or carefully
burn the fuels with a prescribed fire.
Mechanical thinning combined with a
biomass harvesting strategy is often pre-
ferred because of smoke pollution and
potential hazards associated with a pre-
scribed burn. Removing low-value bio-
mass from thinning sites significantly
raises overall costs of treatment, espe-
cially with small-diameter stands.
The economic feasibility of harvest-
ing small-diameter trees is critically im-
portant to logging contractors and forest
managers since harvesting production
declines as tree size and removal inten-
sity per acre decrease (Hartsough et
al.1997, Lortz et al. 1997, Kluender et

al. 1998). The cost of thinning the for-
ests to reduce fire risk ranges from $150
to $550 per acre, which is usually higher
than the market value of the products
(i.e., energy and pulp chips) from thin-
ning (LeVan-Green and Livingston
2001). Wagner et al. (2000) also noted
that sawtimber under 9 inches diameter
at breast height (DBH) could not cover
harvest and delivery cost in western
North America.
An integrated approach to harvesting
both roundwood and biomass, referred
to as an integrated harvesting system, is
becoming common in fuel reduction
treatments. This system uses a set of
equipment to produce roundwood prod-
ucts and to remove all sub-merchantable
size trees and logging slash. Compared
to typical harvesting systems that re-
move merchantable materials only, an
integrated harvesting system requires a
chipper or grinder to convert sub-mer-
chantable size trees and logging slash
into materials of uniform size that can be
handled, transported, and/or stored more
efficiently The process of converting
these forest materials into consumable
products is called comminution (Pottie
and Guimier 1985).
Forest biomass produced from me-
chanical thinning and other sources such
as conventional sawtimber harvesting
and sawmills creates an opportunity for
generating power. Bioenergy may sub-
stitute for fossil fuels under certain
conditions, which can contribute to a re-
duction in emissions of gases that affect
climate changes. However, the total
costs of harvesting biomass from the
stump to the mill may be prohibitive due
to the low market value of thinning ma-
terials and the high costs of thinning and
transportation.
The objectives of this study are to: 1)
compare harvesting costs of thinning
small-diameter stands for sawlog and
biomass fuel; and 2) evaluate the eco-
nomic feasibility ($/ acre) of integrated
harvesting and transportation of
small-diameter trees in southwest Idaho.
Harvesting methods
and cost estimations
Three harvesting methods were ana-
lyzed: whole-tree, tree-length, and
cut-to-length method. In the whole-tree
harvesting method, the tree is felled and
delivered to the landing with limbs and
tops attached to the stem. This results in
a significant reduction of fuels on the
site since most of the felled biomass is
removed from the site. Large piles of
logging slash are left at the landing and
are typically burned at high heat inten-
sity. With an integrated harvesting ap-
proach, slash and sub-merchantable
trees can be chipped into clean chips for
fiber and/or biomass fuel (hog fuel) for
energy production. In the short-wood or
log-length method, trees are processed
at the stump. Non-merchantable trees,
limbs, and tops are left on the site. Fig-
ure 1 illustrates the steps and activities
at each phase of harvesting for both
whole-tree harvesting and cut-to-length
or tree-length harvesting. Three differ-
ent forest products can be recovered
from a whole-tree harvesting approach,
while only two types of materials (saw-
log and clean chip) are harvested with a
cut-to-length or tree-length method.
Two existing programs, ST Harvest
(Hartsough et al. 2001) and Helipace 3.0
(USDA Forest Serv. 2002), were used to
estimate production and costs of six
different harvesting systems: manual
tree-length (TL), manual whole-tree
(WT), mechanical whole-tree, mechani-
cal cut-to-length (CTL), skyline, and he-
licopter yarding with tree-length materi-
als. The ST Harvest model is designed
to estimate the costs of harvesting small
trees in natural stands in the Interior
Northwest of North America. This pro-
gram uses productivity equations as re-
ported in harvesting studies for both
ground-based and skyline systems typi-
cally used in the region. Equipment
prices in the model were updated with
2002 prices.

The Helipace 3.0 program estimates
helicopter logging production and costs,
reflecting typical logging practices and
equipment used in the region. Various
types of helicopters are built into the
program, but a small machine (Bell 204)
was selected for the analysis. Hand fell-
ing and hourly labor costs (eight-person
crew) were the same as those used in the
ST harvest model. No supporting heli-
copter was used in the analysis.
Tree sizes entered into the programs
were 6-, 8-, 10-, and 12-inch DBH.
Thinning was assumed to be a sin-
gle-tree selection and to remove 150
trees per acre for each DBH category.
Each harvesting system produced both
sawlogs and biomass fuel. Chipping was
done at the landing. The ST Harvest
model calculated chip fractions at each
DBH class, based on the tree volume en-
tered. Other user input values include
800 feet maximum skidding/yarding
distance and ground slopes of 15 per-
cent in ground-based systems and 50
percent in skyline yarding. Once pro-
duction rates and costs were estimated
for the alternate sizes of trees, the out-
comes were validated by comparing
them with the database that was built
from recent small-wood harvesting
studies (Lee 2000, Johnson and Keatley
2000).
Transportation of chipped materials
requires a chip van that is characterized
by low ground clearance and a wide
turning radius around a curve, compared
to roundwood trucks. A chip van typi-
cally used to transport chips from saw-
mills to pulp and paper mills or other
chip-using facilities may require signifi-
cant improvements of road standards to
access the sites where sub-merchantable
trees and logging slashes are chipped.
Hauling distance to manufacturing fa-
cilities is an issue with clean chips and
biomass fuels because of their low
market value. Hauling cost of transport-
ing clean chips and biomass fuels may
not be economically feasible, especially
with increased hauling distances. Reve-
nue generated by selling roundwood
produced from fuel reduction thinning
may offset the cost of thinning and trans-
portation. A case study addressing eco-
nomic issues of thinning, chipping at
landing, and transportation was con-
ducted with the stand data that were col-
lected from conifer stands with high
densities in southwest Idaho.
Production and
cost of harvesting
small-diameter trees
Harvesting costs per 100 cubic feet
($/CCF) increased as tree size declined,
and the cost increase was most notice-
able in the 6-inch DBH class (Fig. 2).
Manual harvesting systems showed
slightly higher logging costs than me-
chanical harvesting systems. At 8-inch
DBH, a mechanical whole-tree harvest-
ing system had the lowest cost at
$41.55/CCF. Costs for each phase of the
harvesting activities for each harvesting
system can be found in Table 1. Except
for the mechanical cut-to-length (CTL)
system, skidding cost was the most ex-
pensive component for all ground-based
systems. A break-even analysis for

8-inch DBH showed that the forwarding
cost fell below the skidding cost at dis-
tances greater than 500 feet (Fig. 3). The
break-even distance shifts to a longer
distance as tree size increases. For ex-
ample, the break-even point between
skidding and forwarding options oc-
curred at 800 feet for a tree size of
12-inch DBH.
Skyline and helicopter costs were
much higher than ground-based harvest-
ing systems (Fig. 4). At 10-inch DBH,
skyline and helicopter logging costs
were about three and six times more ex-
pensive than those in a mechanical
whole-tree harvesting system, respec-
tively. Skyline and helicopter logging
costs significantly increased as tree size
decreased, while costs of mechanical
whole-tree harvesting showed only a
slight increase with smaller tree sizes.
Helicopter logging may not be economi-
cally feasible for thinning small-diame-
ter stands (less than an average10-in.
DBH) when the decision is based
entirely on return from the harvested
products. However, helicopter logging
may be the only option for achieving
fuel reduction objectives in highly pro-
tected areas where road and trail access
is highly limited because of construction
cost or environmental constraints and
where environmental issues such as soil
disturbance, soil erosion, and negative
visual impacts are of great concern.
Chipping costs were based on bio-
mass fuel production at the landing and
did not include any other supporting ac-
tivities such as skidding sub-merchant-
able trees to the chipper or the use of a
loader to put limbs and tops near the
chipper (Table 1). Chipping for biomass
fuels in the tree-length and cut-to-length
systems appeared slightly more expen-
sive by about $1.00/CCF than in the
whole-tree system. Concurrent recovery
of biomass fuels with sawlogs requires
landing areas large enough to store
whole trees and processed logs and for a
concurrent operation of chipping and
processing machines. Some delays in an
integrated harvesting system due to un-
balanced production capacities between
machines can be translated to other sys-
tem components (Johnson 1989).
A case study of integrated
harvesting of small-diameter
trees: Emmett thinning sale
The Emmett Ranger District in south-
west Idaho plans to thin small conifer
stands with high densities to reduce the
risk of catastrophic wildfire and to re-
store natural ecosystems containing
historical patterns of species composi-
tion and stand structure. Many planta-
tions established after logging and other
management activities retain a high
number of small-diameter trees, less
than12-inch DBH. Logging slash and
sub-merchantable trees are generally left
at landings due to low market value of
the materials, then burned when condi-
tions allow. This case study examined an
integrated harvesting method to achieve
the objectives of fuel reduction and
maximum utilization of thinning materi-
als, including sawlogs, clean chips, and
biomass fuels. In this case study, an inte-
grated harvesting approach to thin small
trees was evaluated for its economic fea-
sibility, including transportation costs.
Stand description
Stand data were summarized from 19
thinning sales scheduled in 2001 within
the Emmett Ranger District. Stand den-
sity and tree size varied within each sale
unit, but these data were aggregated into

a stand profile (Fig. 5). Tree densities
varied from 136 to 1,130 trees per acre
(TPA) for the 19 sale units, averaging
436 TPA. The targeted number of trees
after thinning was about 100 TPA,
which resulted in 60 to 80 ft.2 of basal
area per acre. Ponderosa pine (Pinus
ponderosa) was the most dominant spe-
cies (86%), along with Douglas-fir
(Psedotsuga menziesii var. glauca) (9%)
and grand fir (Abies grandis) (5%). Tree
sizes were categorized into three aver-
age DBH classes: 3-inch (varying from
1 to 4 in.), 7-inch (5 to 8 in.), and
12-inch (9 to 15 in.). These DBH classes
were used to estimate tree volume, har-
vesting production, and potential prod-
uct recovery. All trees larger than 16-
inch DBH were left on the sites. Tree
height and merchantable wood volume
were calculated using two equations for
ponderosa pine (Wykoff et al. 1982).

Bark added about 9 percent of the
bole volume to the merchantable wood
volume of each DBH category
(Crookston 2002). Crown volume in-
cluded needles, twigs, and branches and
was estimated based on the crown
weight table and conversion factor of 25
pcf (Brown et al. 1977). Tree volume
consists of the bole, bark, and crown.
This volume value was multiplied by the
number of trees per acre to compute the
total volume per acre (Table 2).
Sawlog components were assumed to
be zero for the 3-inch DBH class, but
were 30 percent of the volume for the
7-inch DBH, and 70 percent for the 12-
inch DBH. These assumptions were
based on the results obtained from the
ST Harvest model. All crown and bark
volume from chipping clean chips were
assumed to be recoverable as biomass
fuel. From these assumptions, the
amount of sawlog, clean chip, and bio-
mass fuel produced per acre were com-
puted (Table 3).
An integrated harvesting system
The mechanical whole-tree harvest-
ing system used in the analysis was
comprised of a feller-buncher, grapple
skidder, processor, and loader. A chain
flail delimbing/debarking chipper
(DDC) and a tub-grinder were added to
the system for the production of clean
chips and biomass fuels at the landing. It
was assumed that a chip van would have
access to the landing and would trans-
port chips and biomass fuels to manu-
facturing facilities.
Trees less than 3-inch DBH were sent
directly to a tub-grinder for biomass
fuel, while trees with 7-inch DBH were
sent either to a processor for sawlog pro-
duction or to a DDC for clean chip man-
ufacturing. All trees larger than 12-inch
DBH were sent to a processor for sawlog
production. Limbs and tops generated
from processed trees were sent to a tub-
grinder for biomass fuel production.
Harvesting costs were computed for
four cases: 1) sawlog only; 2) sawlog
and clean chip; 3) sawlog and biomass
fuel; and 4) sawlog, clean chip, and bio-
mass fuel.
Transportation is an important ele-
ment of any timber harvesting project,
often accounting for more than one-
third of the total stump-to-mill cost. Tra-
vel time varies for different segments of
the transportation route, depending
upon surface type, alignment, grade,
and width of road. For the proposed
transportation route, 3 miles (6%) were
single lane access with native material
surface, poor alignment, and 5 percent
grade; 5.5 miles (10%) were single lane
access with graveled surface, fair align-
ment, and 4 percent grade; 8 miles
(15%) were paved surface, fair align-
ment, and 2 percent grade; 35 miles
(65%) were paved surface, good align-
ment, and 0 percent grade; and 2 miles
(4%) were in town. Total distance to the
mill was 53.5 miles. For this haul route,

Total costs of
Emmett thinning sale
The ST Harvest program was used to
estimate harvesting costs, with the ex-
ception of tub-grinding and transporta-
tion costs. The model was run for each
DBH category with sawlog components
of 0, 30, and 70 percent for 3-, 7-, and
12-inch DBH trees, respectively. The
costs of each phase of harvesting were
calculated as a weighted average with
the corresponding total volume removal
in each DBH category as the weighing
factor (Table 4).
All of the potential harvesting costs
including stump-to-truck, clean chip
chipping, tub-grinding, and transporta-
tion are presented in Table 5. The costs
($/acre) were based on total volume
(ft.3/acre) to be harvested and type of
products to be recovered. Harvesting
costs were converted from $/CCF to $/
acre using the average recovered volume
per acre in each diameter class. Costs
expressed in $/acre are generally of
more interest to land managers. De-
pending on the product type(s), costs
were selected and added to find a total
cost. For example, in a sawlogs-only op-
tion,
the
total
cost
would
be
$409.85/acre ($284.87/acre [harvest
without chipping] + $124.98/acre [log
transportation only]). The total costs for
four types of harvesting options are
summarized in Table 6.
Net returns ($/acre) from
selling thinning materials
Current market prices around the
Idaho, eastern Oregon and Washington
area for small-diameter sawlogs, clean
chips, and biomass fuels were used to
estimate potential revenue ($/acre) from
selling thinning materials (Table 7). The
following factors were used to convert
from cubic feet to ton: 45 pcf for green
wood density and 25 pcf for ovendry
density (Nielson et al. 1985).
Net returns ($/acre) were calculated
for four difference cases of product re-
covery: 1) sawlog only, 2) sawlog and
clean chip, 3) sawlog and biomass fuel,
and 4) sawlog, clean chip, and biomass
fuel. Sawlog made the highest contribu-
tion to the total revenue of $739.79/acre,
although it represented the least amount
of product volume recovered. As a re-

sult, the sawlog-only option showed a
positive return of $20.61/acre. Net return
values in Table 6 were based on a trans-
portation distance of 53.5 miles. This
was close to a break-even distance for
the sawlog-only option; net return was
close to zero. All other options produced
negative returns under the assumptions
of our model. These results strongly in-
dicate that the markets for thinning ma-
terials need to be close to harvesting
sites; for the sawlog-only option, the
sawmill would need to be located within
about 60 miles to make a positive return
from a thinning sale similar to this case
study (Fig. 6).
Factors affecting economic
feasibility of small-wood
harvesting and utilization
Forest harvesting systems. — Equip-
ment used to thin small-diameter trees
greatly affects the profitability of log-
ging operations and returns to a land-
owner. Lower-cost systems are gener-
ally considered first, but other factors
such as ground slope and other environ-
mental constraints often dictate the final
selection of a harvesting system. Eco-
nomic feasibility of small-wood har-
vesting becomes more questionable
when a higher cost harvesting system
must be used to achieve the silvicultural
treatment objectives.
Road accessibility. — Road accessi-
bility affects the feasibility of small-
wood harvesting in two ways. First, con-
structing access roads to the harvesting
site is costly and can cause a large nega-
tive impact on net return from a small-
wood thinning sale. Secondly, potential
accessibility by a chip van will deter-
mine whether materials other than
sawlogs can be recovered. There can be
no in-wood recovery of clean chips or
biomass fuels if a chip van cannot access
the landing sites. Conditions that limit
chip van accessibility include sharp
curves, narrow road widths, and rough
road surfaces.
Hauling distance to manufacturing
facilities. — Transportation is a critical
factor affecting economic feasibility of
small-wood harvesting and utilization
overall, especially with low-value mate-
rials such as clean chips and biomass fu-
els. As seen in Figure 6, thinning mate-
rials from small-diameter trees carry
low market values and typically do not
offset high transportation costs associ-
ated with long hauling distances. The fa-
cilities utilizing biomass fuels need to be
near the harvesting sites to make bio-
mass fuel harvest financially feasible.
Market price of thinning materials. —
Market prices for forest products greatly
vary with geographical location and raw
material demand within a region. Forest
products prices in the Pacific Northwest
are different from those in other regions
in the United States. Within the Pacific
Northwest region, Idaho shows lower
prices for the same products when com-
pared to Oregon and Washington. These
low prices are due to recent mill closures
in southwest Idaho, creating a situation
where the supply of raw materials in the
area exceeds demand. Any increase in
market prices for materials generated
from thinning operations will enhance
the profitability of an integrated har-
vesting system for small trees.
