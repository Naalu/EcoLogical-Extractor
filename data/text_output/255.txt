Ponderosa Pine Understory Response to 
Short-Term Grazing Exclusion (Arizona)

L
ives t~ck graz:ing is a pe~vasive land use practice on 
public lands In the American Southwest, making it an 
important variable in land management practices. While 
most grazing allotments are stocked each year, short rest 
periods (1-2 years) are used to minimize potential negative 
impacts of grazing and to sustain range resources (Curtin 
2002). Moore and others (1999) specifically recommend 
deferment of livestock grazing on ponderosa pine (Pinus 
ponderosa) forests after thinning and burning as ecological 
restoration treatments. Few data are available, however, 
on the influence of short-term grazing exclusion on the 
understory plant community of pine forest restoration 
projects. In this study, we attempt to quantify the impacts 
ofcattle grazing on plant cover, species richness, and non­
native species on a ponderosa pine restoration project in 
northern Arizona. 
In the summer of 2005, the Arizona Game and Fish 
Department erected several35 m x 35 m cattle exclosuresat 
the Mt. Trumbull, Arizona, ecological restoration research 
site on the Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument.

Figure 1. Median (25th, 75th percentiles) cheatgrass cover per plot, 
separated by both grazing and restoration treatments. Results of 
Kruskal-Wallis ranked signs analysis were significant for year x grazing x 
restoration (treated vs. control) interaction (X' =32.01, P =0.001). 
We used these exclosures to evaluate the short-term effects 
of cattle exclusion on the herbaceous understory in a 
ponderosa pine forest. We established ten paired plots 
consisting of a grazing treatment exclosure and a similarly 
sized grazed control. Of the ten pairs, five were located in 
a thinned and burned forest and five in unrestored areas. 
The plots were dispersed across the 1,200 ha Little Spring 
pasturc ofthe M t, Logan allotment, where elevations range 
from 2,000 to 2,250 m, and the mean annual precipitation 
from 2002 to 2007 was 413 mm (WRCC 2007). Cattle 
grazing occurs on the Mt, Logan allotment only from July 
through October at a maximum stocking rate of 13.6 hal 
AUM (Whit Bunting, BLM, pers. comm.). In 2006, how­
ever,grazing pressure was reduced by a break in a fencc that 
allowed cattle to stray into the adjacent Tuweap allotment. 
The unrestored sites within thc project are predomi­
nantly dense stands of ponderosa pine with thick litter 
and duff layers and a sparse understory. The restored areas 
were thinned and burned to emulate pre-I 870 tree density 
and distribution. Restoration treatment areas have a more 
diverse and abundant understory community and substan­
tially fewer trees per hectare (399.2) than the prerestoration 
conditions (784.6) and the untreated controls (873.5). All 
restoration treatments on our study plots were completed 
by 2001 (see Roccaforte et al. 2009 for details), and cattle 
were reintroduced in the summer of2002 (Whit Bunting, 
BLM, pers. comm.). 
The dominant tree species is ponderosa pine, though 
there is a considerable amount of Gambel oak (Quercus 
gambelii) on site. The main native species are silver lupine 
(Lupinus argenteus) and the important perennial forage 
grassesbottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus e/ymoides) and west­
ern wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smitbiii. In 2003, cheatgrass 
(Bromus tectorum) invaded the site. Cheatgrass is the most 
abundant non-native species present, and this annual grass

rypanospermic, or boring, fruits have one or more 
hygroscopic awns that twist and untwist in response 
to changes in relative humidity, with the effect of drill­
ing the seed into the soil (Van Rheede van Oudtshoorn 
and van Rooyen 1999). In addition to assisting with self­
burial, hygroscopic awns enable seeds to disperse, find 
suitable microhabitats for seed germination and seedling 
establishment, and avoid damage by fire and seed preda­
tors (e.g., Garnier and Dajoz 2001, Peart 1984). Studies 
have demonstrated that complete removal of hygroscopic 
awns results in immobile seeds and, in many cases, failure 
to germinate (e.g., Collins and Wein 1997, Sindel et at. 
1993). Although these studies have investigated species 
that have from one to several awns, the deawning thresh­
old to allow self-burial has not been tested for species with 
multiple awns (but see Peart 1979 for one-awn thresh­
old). Chambers (2000) pointed out that aspects of seed 
morphology such as awns can influence seed entrapment, 
Figure 1. Beach three-awn grass (Aristida tuberculosa) has three awns of 
similar length (30--40 mm) twisted together basally into an 8-15 mm 
column. This species is an annual clump grass (30-70 cm) that grows 
in sandy soil habitats (sandy fields, hills, pinelands, maritime dunes, 
xeric pine-oak sandhills, and disturbed areas). It is critically impaired 
in Connecticut, Maryland, Michigan and New Hampshire; impaired in 
Indiana and Massachusetts; and vulnerable in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, 
Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, and Virginia (Nature5erve 2008).

seed retention, and seedling establishment and therefore 
should be considered in restoration. Deawning may be an 
important factor in the successful establishment of spe­
cies with hygroscopic awns in habitat restoration projects, 
since the removal of awns may hinder seed germination 
and seedling survival. Most seeds used in habitat restora­
tion projects have undergone seed cleaning processes that 
separate pure seed from chaff and other vegetative debris 
such as awns. 
The two objectives of this study are to determine the 
deawning threshold to allow for self-burial, and to inves­
tigate how deawning influences germination and seedling 
survival for beach three-awn grass (Aristida tuberculosa, 
Figure 1). We predict that progressive deawning will hinder 
seed self-burial, seed germination, and seedling establish­
ment for this species. We selected beach three-awn grass 
for this study because 1) it has multiple awns: 2) it is a 
rare species in many states across its range in the USA 
(NatureServe 2008), and this information could aid in 
ex situ reintroduction projects in habitats such as oak 
savanna and dry sand prairie; and 3) previous research by 
Collins and Wein (1997) demonstrated that completely 
to partially buried awned seeds of beach three-awn grass 
will germinate.
