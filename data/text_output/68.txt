Executive Summary 
 
The importance of native plant materials is increasing as disturbance events, such as 
wildfire, drought, and livestock grazing continue throughout the western United States.  These 
disturbance events often create environments suitable for the invasion and establishment of non-
native species further threatening native ecosystems. The need for seeding these disturbed lands 
has created a large demand for locally-adapted native plants and seed.  Use of locally-adapted 
plant materials has been shown to improve the success of restoration projects and maintain 
genetic diversity, which is a vital mechanism by which native plant communities can adapt and 
evolve.  Due to the lack of availability and costs for these materials however, many public 
policies continue to allow the use of non-native plant materials.  The use of these materials can 
compromise the success of restoration projects and can lead to further ecosystem degradation.  
With an increasing number of large-scale restoration/rehabilitation projects within northern 
Arizona, agencies and organizations are interested in ways to develop an increased supply of 
locally-adapted plant materials. 
This study assesses the opportunity to develop a native plant and seed industry in 
northern Arizona.  To do this, supply and demand surveys were created and administered to 
identify the most salient issues needed to be considered when initiating a native plant materials 
market within the region.  Through an extensive interview and searching process, participants for 
each of the surveys were identified.  Survey questions were developed based on preliminary 
information gained through interviews.  Survey topics included native plant materials purchasing 
and expenditures, native plant sales, use and needs, issues and concerns, equipment and 
operations, collaboration and funding, and policies and regulations.  Survey pre-testing allowed 
for testing of survey question comprehension, efficiency relevancy, and format organization.   

viii 
 
 
The survey revealed several important issues to both suppliers and buyers of native seed.  
Both such entities agree that locally-adapted plant materials are important, but that extreme 
elevation and climate conditions within the region make defining the term “local genotype” 
difficult.  From a supplier’s perspective, inconsistent demand and insufficient knowledge on how 
to successfully produce native plant materials were important limiting factors. Yet, purchasers 
appear to be discouraged by the lack of availability and cost of these materials.  It appears that 
within the current market, there is an inconsistent demand for native plant materials due to 
unpredictability of natural disturbance events such as fire size and frequency or the extent and 
severity of drought.  In addition, organization/agency policy often drives decisions on whether 
native plant materials are purchased, and, while most agencies have policies requiring the use of 
native seeds, lack of their availability allows for the continued use of non-native species. An 
inconsistent and unreliable demand has made suppliers hesitant to further the development of 
native plant materials. Stewardship contracting (where federal agencies contract with 
communities in order to help provide a continuing source of local income and employment while 
restoring and maintaining healthy forest ecosystems), or buy-back programs in which agencies 
contract with growers to buy-back a portion of the materials produced,  could be used to provide 
suppliers the guaranteed demand they necessitate.     
Although an abundance of information is available regarding native plant harvesting, 
cleaning, propagation, and proper storage, this information is not adequately disseminated.  
Increased communication, information sharing, and partnerships among producers, government 
agencies, land managers and organizations proves to be important for initiation of a successful 
market.  A regional working group, the Northern Arizona Native Seed Alliance (NANSA) has 
begun working toward increasing information sharing and collaboration on native plant projects 

ix 
 
among its members.  Members include individuals, government agencies, non-profit 
organizations, and businesses from the region.  However, NANSA is still in its infancy. In  order 
for its efforts to become more effective, a stronger involvement among its members needs to 
occur. 
The largest factors in determining native plant materials supply and demand appears to be 
the needs of government agencies involved in landcape-scale revegetation and their associated 
native plant and seed certification policies.  Agencies, particularly federal and state, will continue 
to play an important role in market development.   In using two successful restoration programs 
within the Great Basin and the Uncompahgre Plateau as native plant market models, most 
funding for these programs comes from federal agencies.    The amount of funding needed for 
initiation of a native plant materials project in northern Arizona is estimated to be between 
$500,000 to $800,000 for the first year and between $2,000,000 and $6,000,000 over a five year 
period.  Investigation of ways to secure this amount of funding should be a top priority of 
regional land managers involved in a regional native plant market.

I.  Project Overview 
 
Disturbance events, such as wildfire, drought, and livestock grazing continue to rise 
throughout the western United States threatening native plant communities.  Currently, the 
supply of native plant materials is limited throughout northern Arizona and elsewhere in the 
Southwest.  Due to an increasing need for locally-adapted plant materials (Richards et al., 1998; 
USDI and USDA, 2002; Shaw et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2007), many federal, state, private and 
nonprofit entities have become interested in the possibility of producing native plant materials.  
This study was developed to obtain baseline information and reveal the most salient issues 
concerning the development of a localized (northern Arizona) native plant materials market.  
With the information and insight gained from this study, useful recommendations on how to 
proceed with initiation of the market are made.  Further, this study can be used as a model for 
native plant materials development outside northern Arizona.  
 
Problem Statement 
The need for native plant materials is increasing as large-scale disturbance events, such as 
wildfires, drought, livestock grazing, and further disruption from invasive species which results 
from these disturbances continue throughout the western United States.  Current federal policy 
stresses the need for seeding these disturbed lands (USDI and USDA, 2002; USDI and USDA, 
2006) and thus has created a large demand for locally-adapted native plants and seed.  However, 
a minimal local supply of these plant materials has resulted in federal, state, tribal, and private 
dollars being spent on native plant materials from non-regional and sometimes out-of-state 
sources.  Using genotypes from distant sources can not only compromise seeding success, but 

2 
 
can lead to ecological problems such as poor adaptation and genetic contamination over time 
(Rogers and Montalvo, 2004).   
As the extent of disturbance events increases in the Southwest, revegetation of disturbed 
lands has become essential.  In recent years, the trend has been towards an increased use of 
native species.  Land managers are now faced with issues concerning the genotypes of native 
species used within the region.  Current research indicates that the use of local genotypes 
considerably improves the success of restoration projects.  Plants grown from locally-adapted 
native seed have been shown to display increased growth, survival, and production when 
compared to non-local seed (Knapp and Rice, 1994; Belnap, 1995; Linhart, 1995; Mortlock, 
2000).  Sound land management practices demand the use of locally-adapted plant materials to 
properly restore native plant communities and associated ecological processes.  Reliable 
quantities of these materials are needed to sufficiently supply the increasing number of large-
scale revegetation projects within northern Arizona.   
Research, applying climate projections using global circulation models (GCMs), 
consistently indicates that increased temperature will likely extend fire seasons throughout the 
western United States, and predicts that fires will become larger and more severe (McKenzie et 
al., 2003; Westerling et al., 2006, Seager et al. 2007).  Extreme fire conditions have negative 
effects on plant reestablishment including increases in exotic species (Schoennagel et al., 2004; 
Freeman et al., 2007; Kerns et al., 2006) and seedling and seed mortality, both of which lead to 
lower species abundance and richness (Schoennagel et al., 2004; Hunter and Omi, 2006).  Under 
these climate predictions, demand for post-fire seeding materials will increase if native plant 
communities are unable to regenerate on their own.  Beyond post-fire restoration, revegetation 
projects are an important part of land management for a variety of federal and state agencies’ 

3 
 
activities associated with invasive species management, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat 
management, roadside rehabilitation, and recreational and agricultural use.   
The development of native plant materials has been slow to emerge.  Past trends have 
focused on research and large-scale production of native tree species and use of low-cost non-
native species.  Government policies have begun to reflect increasing attention on the use of 
natives for seeding activities, but due to the high cost and lack of materials, seeding policies 
continue to allow the use of non-natives (Wolfson and Sieg, in review).  Research on genetics 
and propagation of many native shrubs, forbs and grasses (Monsen et al., 2004), which are of 
interest for current restoration practices, remains limited.  A lack of information needed to 
produce these plant materials on a large-scale basis resulted in only small-scale production.  This 
has kept costs for native seed high which often restricts the amount of seed buyers are able or 
willing to purchase. 
At present, wildland collections from unmanaged natural stands are a major source of 
seed for most species.  However, year to year fluctuations in seed production results in high 
market prices making it difficult to include certain desirable species in restoration and 
revegetation projects (Stevens et al., 1996).   
 
Geographic Scope 
This study focuses on regions within Arizona which are north of the Mogollon Rim 
(Figure 1.1).  The Mogollon Rim forms a long escarpment which stretches southwest of Flagstaff 
and runs southeast following the Coconino-Tonto National Forest boundaries to the White 
Mountains of eastern Arizona along the southern boundary of the Apache-Sitgreaves National 
Forest.  The Mogollon Rim also marks the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau in Arizona.   

4 
 
This study focuses on three main ecological regions above the Mogollon Rim; (1)  
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest, (2) pinyon pine (Pinus edulis)-juniper (Juniperus 
osteosperma and Juniperus monosperma) woodland, and (3) semi-arid grassland and shrubland.

Objectives 
The main objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of producing native plant 
materials within the northern Arizona region. Other objectives are to: 
1. Identify and assess current and future needs and concerns of the stakeholders involved in 
both the supply and demand of native plant materials.  
2. Investigate current governmental and state policies for the use of native species, native 
plant programs, native plant material harvesting regulations, and native seed certification 
mandates and procedures. 
3. Assess critical components involved in developing a successful commercial native plant 
materials market by examining the structure and operations of seed suppliers currently in 
place. 
4. Develop models or scenarios that may lead to an available native plant materials source.

II. Introduction 
Differentiation between the terms restoration and rehabilitation is essential when 
discussing the use of native plant materials.  Both of these terms are used throughout this study 
and, therefore, defining them is important to understanding the information this study presents.  
Both restoration and rehabilitation activities are important tools in protecting native plant 
communities structure and function.   Disturbance events, such as climate change, drought, 
wildfire, invasive species, herbivory, urbanization, and the use of non-local plant materials can 
have adverse effects on native plant communities.  As disturbance events increase, the use of 
locally-adapted plant materials during restoration and rehabilitation will be increasingly 
valuable. 
 
Definition of Restoration and Rehabilitation  
According to the Society for Ecological Restoration International (SER), “ecological 
restoration is the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, 
damaged, or destroyed” (SER, 2002) with the ultimate goal of reestablishing indigenous 
ecosystem processes which make it resilient and self-sustaining (Clewell and Aronson, 2007).  
Ecological restoration is a process which may take centuries to achieve.  Long-term commitment 
of land managers is an essential component to its success (Burke and Mitchell, 2007).  In 
comparison, rehabilitation seeks to repair degraded ecosystem processes, restore pre-existing 
conditions, and recreate sustaining ecosystems with the primary goal of increasing ecosystem 
productivity (SER, 2002; Aronson et al., 1993).  Pre-existing conditions and sustainable 
ecosystems in this sense may not necessarily be those which are fully indigenous.  Furthermore, 

7 
 
land managers use rehabilitation practices when restoration may be deemed impossible and 
instead seeks to achieve desired conditions as rapidly as possible (Aronson et al., 1993).   
 
Large-scale disturbances and effects on native vegetation 
Over the past century, changing climate conditions, fire suppression, non-native species 
invasion, exploitation of rangelands, urbanization, and use of non-local genotype plant materials 
have lead to an alteration of soil and plant resources and an overall loss of native plant 
community productivity and diversity (Milton et al., 1994; Monsen and McArthur, 1995; 
Holmgren and Scheffer, 2001).   Native plant communities have in turn become more susceptible 
to pathogens, non-native species, and their long-term sustainability threatened (Schmid, 1994; 
Hufford and Mazer, 2003).  
 
Climate Change 
Climate change models provide strong evidence that increased CO2, temperature, and 
altered precipitation patterns will affect the survival and growth of individuals, the distribution 
and composition of species, and fire relations within communities (Ryan, 1991; Bachelet et al., 
2001).  Both CO2 and temperature are key factors affecting plant development and function 
(Morison and Lawlor, 1999).  Enriched CO2 levels have the ability to alter primary and 
secondary metabolism as a result of increases in photosynthesis and carbohydrate production 
over plant growth, maintenance and storage demands (Farrar and Williams, 1991; Veteli et al, 
2002).  These changes will dictate plant productivity.  Although elevated temperatures can 
increase net primary production (NPP) through enhanced photosynthesis and nutrient availability 
through higher rates of decomposition, excessive temperatures have the ability to decrease net 

8 
 
primary production by decreasing soil moisture, inactivate enzymes and decrease carbohydrate 
pools by increasing plant respiration (Peng and Apps, 1999), and amplify the effects of elevated 
CO2 (Veteli et al., 2002).  As extreme temperatures rapidly decrease soil moisture, whole plant 
communities will undergo water related stress leading to decreased ability to compete with 
nearby species ultimately constraining plant distribution and abundance.  (Wittaker, 1975; 
Niering and Lowe, 1984; Hanson and Wiltzin, 2000).  Overall, community responses to changes 
in temperature, CO2, and precipitation as well as species adaptability will play an important role 
in determining species distributions and ability to succeed under extreme climate change events 
(Aber et al., 2001). 
 
Drought 
Generally, the majority of the western United States is characterized by periodic drought. 
Water stress related issues are not uncommon throughout many western forests.  Concerns 
regarding native vegetation impacts due to drought have become amplified because of increasing 
rates of climate change (Hanson and Wiltzin, 2000).  In the arid regions where drought stress is 
important, a longer growing season will prolong drought stress which may lead to reduced 
growth resulting from altered water use efficiency and water stress conditions (Hanson and 
Wiltzin, 2000; Aber et al., 2001).  Repeated episodes of drought affecting soil water availability 
could constrain seedling establishment and lead to increased drought-induced mortality (Hanson 
and Wiltzin, 2000).   Mortality of drought-intolerant species will alter plant community 
composition, decrease plant diversity, and create conditions favorable to non-native species 
invasions.  
 

9 
 
Wildfire 
Climate change will have a profound affect on fire regimes within the western United 
States by increasing the area burned, fire season duration, and fire frequency and severity, all of 
which could have an immediate and significant impact on ecosystems (Nitschke and Innes, 
2006; Flannigan et al., 2000).  Several studies have shown that drought will induce reductions in 
decomposition rates.  Lower decomposition rates may cause a buildup of organic material on 
the forest floor which has the potential to alter fire regimes (Hanson and Wiltzin, 2000; Dale et 
al., 2001).   
Many native species within western United States ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) 
forests are well adapted to fires of low intensity (Hunter and Omi, 2006) and respond positively 
when burning conditions are optimal.  When in combination, optimal fire frequency and low 
fire intensity have shown to favor native understory species richness and diversity and biomass 
productivity by decreasing competition and litter cover (Knapp and Seastedt, 1986; Brockway 
and Lewis, 1997; Laughlin et al. 2004).   However, research of many crown-fire ecosystems, 
those accustomed to longer fire intervals, supports predictions that species abundance and 
richness may be lower following relatively short fire intervals.  As time between fires shortens, 
fire intolerant species may be unable to recover sufficiently, leading to decreased species 
abundance (Schoennagel et al., 2004; Thanos and Daskalakou, 2000), and more specifically that 
of dominant long-lived trees and shrubs.   
Fire severity also plays an important role in controlling post-fire ecosystem structure and 
function through direct impacts on underground plant root and reproduction tissues and soil seed 
banks (Dale et al., 2001).  Variations in fire severity can occur within a single burned landscape. 
These variations affect regeneration of understory plant communities differentially and have the 

10 
 
potential to influence native plant distribution and abundance (McKenzie et al., 2004), 
reestablishment (Turner and Romme, 1994), and the distance seeds will have to travel for 
regeneration (Flannigan et al., 2000).  Results from a study by conducted by Turner and Romme 
(1994), showed that extensive areas that experienced fires of high severity are likely to have few 
resprouting individuals and much of the seedbank destroyed.  Seed banks and seed supply are 
important sources of recovering vegetation following a disturbance.  As a result, severe fires tend 
to reduce total native plant coverage and species richness (Wang and Kemball, 2005).  
  
Invasive Species 
Available literature suggests that non-native plant invasions not only affect native plant 
diversity but can alter entire ecosystem structure and function.  The success of introduced non-
native species may be attributed to a combination of human-caused introductions, biological 
strategies, environmental characteristics of the invaded ecosystem, and biotic interactions within 
the plant community.  These mechanisms have enabled exotic species to invade and outcompete 
natives by being competitively superior.  For example, non-native grass species were 
traditionally selected and developed to revegetate and improve rangelands based on their ability 
to quickly establish, hardiness, adaptability, and ability to withstand grazing (Monsen and Shaw, 
2001; Rogers and Montalvo, 2004).  Because of exotic species competitive abilities, they were 
able to replace native plant species and create biotic homogeneity that has reduced native species 
diversity (Blair, 2001). 
Disturbance effects on exotic species pose yet another threat to native plant communities.  
Conditions of increased availability of light, nutrients, and bare ground have been associated 
with the establishment of non-native plant species (Schoennagel et al., 2004; Wang and Kemball, 

11 
 
2005; Freeman et al., 2007) due to their ability to outcompete native species by capturing 
resources necessary for growth (Kerns et al., 2006).  For example, as forest fires become more 
frequent, fire-adapted species will play a major role in shaping forest ecosystem composition, 
structure and function.  Shorter fire-return intervals facilitate invasion by non-native annuals, 
many of which are nitrogen fixers.  As nitrogen availability declines after fire, as studies 
throughout many western coniferous forests have shown, nitrogen fixers will have a competitive 
advantage (McKenzie et al., 2004; Schoennagel et al., 2004).  As non-native fire-adapted species 
exploit fire prone environments, selection against many longer lived fire-intolerant species 
normally associated with late successional stages in western forests may occur (Nitschke and 
Innes, 2006).   
 
Domestic and Wildlife Herbivory  
Herbivores, both domestic and wildlife, depend heavily on native plant communities and 
in turn have the potential to affect and cause major changes to plant community composition and 
structure (Augustine and McNaughton, 1998).   Herbivory has the ability to negatively alter 
growth rates, nutrient uptake ability, and litter quality, all of which have subsequent effects on 
entire ecosystem processes (Pastor and Cohen, 1997).  
Livestock grazing density plays a large role in determining overall effects on the plant 
community.   Stabilized levels of livestock grazing have been used to maintain palatable species 
and increase their growth potential (Augustine and McNaughton, 1998).  However, as cattle 
density increases, selectivity on forage species declines due to reduced availability of the 
preferred species, leading to communities dominated by unpalatable species (Healy, 1997).  
Intense grazing affects ecosystem processes by reducing native herbaceous cover and litter, 

12 
 
disturbance and compaction of soils, reduced water infiltration rates, increased soil erosion and 
decrease ability of vegetation recovery (Baker and Guthery, 1990; Fleischner, 1994; Milton et 
al., 1994; Belsky and Blumenthal, 1997; Beschta et al., 2004).  Thus, poor grazing practices can 
decrease native plant diversity (Kimball and Schiffman, 2003; Fleischner, 1994) and increase 
non-native invasions (Beschta et al., 2004).   
 
Urbanization 
As population growth within the western United States continues (Campbell, 1996) rapid 
conversion of natural landscapes into urban landscapes will persist.  Urban environments are 
often associated with increased nitrogen inputs which indirectly affect plants, microbes, and soil 
chemistry.  Within urbanized landscapes, negative effects on ecosystem processes such as 
decomposition, nitrogen-cycling, and plant community structure are attributed to increased 
average temperatures (McDonnell et al., 1997).  Large amounts of disturbance created by 
building roads and structures destroy native vegetation and increases the likelihood of invasion 
and establishment of non-native species (McKinney, 2002; Sukopp, 2004).  Effects of exotic 
invasions as previously mentioned severely affect native plant community structure and function.  
Other disturbances associated with urbanization include soil compaction, mowing, and herbicide 
application, all of which have the potential to negatively affect native plant communities.  
Urbanization is a rapidly growing cause of changes in native species richness and composition 
(Sukopp, 2004).   
    

13 
 
Plant Genotypes 
Knowing a plant’s genetic orgin (genotype) can strongly influence the establishment 
success of revegetation projects (Aubry et al., 2005).  Although land managers try to use as much 
locally-adapted plant materials as feasible, large-scale projects often necessitate the use of plant 
materials from non-local sources because of limited funding and resources (McKay et al., 2005).  
These materials represent genotypes that may be poorly adapted to the restoration site conditions 
(Hufford and Mazer, 2003). To complicate matters, most suppliers produce plant materials which 
originate from few genotypes (Williams, 2001).  Subsequently, restoration projects incorporate 
seed from less genetically diverse individuals (McKay et al., 2005).  Plant populations that are 
less genetically diverse are more susceptible to pathogens (Schmid, 1994).  Loss of genetic 
variation has also been shown to lower seed germination rates and fewer reproductive shoots, 
indicating the possibility for lowered population fitness (Williams, 2001).   Restoration projects 
incorporating plant materials from distant sources have the potential to affect adjacent native 
plant populations by introducing less fit genotypes (Potts et al., 2003; McKay et al., 2005) and 
may result in homogenization or replacement of local genotypes (Hufford and Mazer, 2003). 
Outbreeding depression resulting from genetic crossing between individuals adapted to 
different environments can threaten long-term sustainability of the restored site by reducing 
viability of the population (Hufford and Mazer, 2003).  Therefore, outbreeding depression may 
lead to an increased expression of phenotypes which are either maladapted to local conditions or 
genetically superior to local-genotype species (Lynch, 1991).  Alternatively, an increase in those 
which are genetically superior could cause a decrease in locally-adapted individuals and the 
formation of new invasive genotypes (Aubry et al., 2005).  In either case, success of the restored 
site is jeopardized.  

14 
 
For restoration to be successful, species should be both locally-adapted and genetically 
diverse (Rogers, 2004).  Genetic variation within and among populations is vital to evolutionary 
change.  Thus, maintenance of genetic diversity is a vital mechanism by which plant 
communities can adapt and evolve to survive in a changing climate (Huenneke, 1991).   
According to the Native Seed Network (www.nativeseednetwork.org), defined 
ecoregions are useful frameworks for organizing ecosystems and addressing native plant 
materials issues, and thus can be considered as a practical way of identifying seed transfer 
boundaries.  The Arizona Game and Fish Department (AZGFD) has identified six ecoregions 
within Arizona.  These ecoregions include: Colorado Plateau, Arizona-New Mexico Mountains, 
Apache Highlands North, Apache Highlands South, Sonoran Desert, and the Mohave Desert 
(Figures 2.1).

III. Governmental Native Plant Policy and Programs 
Since the 1980s, policies regarding the use of native plant materials have strengthened.  
The establishment of national policies on the use of and need for native plant materials has 
provided direction for further development of federal and state native plant policies.  However, 
due to the lack of availability and cost associated with these materials, native species from non-
local sources continue to be used for revegetation of disturbed wildlands.  Because of the 
increased threat of non-native species invasions, seed certification has become an important 
preventative measure most agencies take to ensure that seed being purchased, regardless of whether 
seed is from native or non-native species, is not contaminated with noxious weeds.  Furthermore, 
the increased use of native species has lead to the establishment of alternative seed certification 
methods.   
Policies have also made available the funding needed to develop various native plant 
programs.  Currently, many of these programs have shifted their focus to conducting research on 
the development of genetically-appropriate native plant materials to be incorporated in local 
restoration projects.  With an increasing amount of research emphasizing the importance of 
genetic considerations of these materials, agencies have begun to recognize the value of using 
locally-adapted plant materials when vegetating federal and state lands, and new policies on their 
use have arisen.  Federal and state native plant policies and programs vary but share a common 
goal in protecting native plant communities from ground disturbing events (Table 3.1). 
 
 
 
 

17 
 
Federal/National Policies 
The Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) of 1976 and the National Forest 
Management Act (NFMA) of 1976 authorized the United States Department of the Interior’s 
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Forest 
Service (USFS) to plan and manage federal lands.  Specifically, NFMA was intended to protect 
plant and animal biodiversity in national forests (16 U.S.C. 1600 (section 6 (b)). These two 
federal acts helped strengthen policy direction for revegetating federal lands with native species 
(Richards et al., 1998; Soller, 2003).   
Wildfires are one of the biggest reasons for past and current restoration efforts on 
federally-administered lands within the region.  Over the last 30 years, the total amount of 
acreage burned in Arizona and New Mexico has considerably increased (Figure 3.1).  Current 
climate projections suggest that the size and intensity of wildfires will continue to increase over 
the next several decades as drought conditions persist (McKenzie et al., 2003; Westerling et al., 
2006).  Under these climate projections, the need for post-fire seeding and the use of native 
species to restore lands disturbed will continue. 
Although emergency watershed rehabilitation after wildfires began in the late 1960s, 
(Neary et al., 2000) and post-fire seeding has occurred since the 1920s, (Beyers, 2004; 
Robichaud et al., 2000), formal policies on emergency watershed rehabilitation were not 
established until the late 1980s.  Ways to minimize potential impacts on vegetation communities 
primarily for wildlife habitat and forage needs began to be addressed at this time (Neary et al., 
2000).   In the 1990s an effort began to make stabilization/rehabilitation policies more consistent 
across federal agency boundaries (GAO, 2006; Neary et al., 2000).  Today, standard policies for 
post-fire emergency stabilization/rehabilitation include: (1) evaluating the need for treatments, 

18 
 
(2) monitoring treatments, (3) repairing land and facilities damaged by fires, (4) stabilizing biotic 
communities, and (5) preventing further degradation of important cultural and natural resources 
(Neary et al., 2000; USDI and USDA, 2006).    
 
 
Figure 3.1: Total acreage burned by wildfires on all Federally-administered lands in Arizona and 
New Mexico from 1950-2007 (Sackett, Haase, and Harrington 1993; NIFC, Fire Information) 
According to Section 4.2.3 of the Interagency Burned Area Emergency Response 
Guidebook (USDI and USDA, 2006), which is an interpretation of both United States 
Department of the Interior (USDI) Department Manual 620 Chapter 3 (USDI, 2004) and United 
States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service Manual 2523 (USDA 2004), natural 
recovery of native species is preferred.  However, emergency rehabilitation treatments are 
completed after initial assessments of the burned area deem it necessary (Neary et al., 2000; 
Wirth and Pyke, 2007).  Among all post-fire rehabilitation treatments in place, grass seeding 
most often applied aerially, is the most commonly used and most cost-effective treatment to 
stabilize soils and establish ground cover (Robichaud et al., 2000; Beyers, 2004).  Non-native

species have traditionally been used during post-fire seeding, although in recent years, new 
policies have directed federal agencies to use native species, when practical (Richards et al., 
1998; Beyers, 2004).  All seed purchased for treatments must be tested and meet the 
requirements of; (1) the Federal Seed Act (7 USC 1551-1610), (2) the state seed laws where seed 
is delivered to, and (3) Federal specification JJJ-S-181.  The use of certified seed is required if 
available, and the use of source-identified seed is recommended when native seed is collected 
from wildland sites (USDI and USDA, 2006).   
More recent policies and programs regarding the use of native plants on public lands aim 
to identify proper native seed sources, conserve biological diversity, and regulate the genetic 
sources of native seed.  In 1995, the Office of the Federal Environmental Executive (OFEE) 
issued a final guidance document to implement an April 1994 presidential executive 
memorandum on federal landscaping practices. The document states that federal grounds and 
federally funded projects should use regionally native plants for landscaping, taking place in 
mainly urban settings, to conserve the natural environment (OFEE, 1995). This memorandum is 
often interpreted as law (Bermant and Spackeen, 1997). 
Perhaps one of the most significant policies pertaining to restoration of native species 
was the signing of Executive Order 13112 in February 1999.  Executive Order 13112 established 
the National Invasive Species Council (NISC) whose primary focus is to prevent the introduction 
of invasive species, provide for their control, and to minimize the economic, ecological, and 
human health impacts caused by invasive species.  Section 2 of the Order directs all federal 
agencies to “provide for restoration of native species and habitat conditions in ecosystems that 
have been invaded by non-native species.”  To help in the effort, Congress established the 
Federal Interagency Native Plant Materials Development Committee in 2000 in order to facilitate 

20 
 
the development, supply and management of needed native plant materials.  To initiate the 
National Plant Materials Development Program, the BLM and the USFS directed $5 million and 
$10 million, respectively, in 2001.  In April 2002, a report to Congress addressed the need for 
additional funding to supply land management agencies with native plant materials for 
restoration practices and the need for an interagency native seed program (USDI and USDA, 
2002).  As a result of these efforts, several interagency programs have been established in order 
to help develop an increase supply of native plant materials.  Specifically, the Federal 
Interagency Native Plant Materials Development Program, the Great Basin Native Plant 
Selection and Increase Project (GBNSIP),  the Uncompahgre Plateau Project (UP Project), the 
Colorado Plateau Native Plant Initiative (CPNPI), and the “Seeds of Success” Program (SOS) 
have been created as an interagency effort.  These programs and initiatives have made a great 
deal of progress in research associated with native plant material development, however, actual 
development of adequate amounts of these materials have been minimal.  
As part of the Healthy Forests Initiative (16 U.S.C. 2104 Note), the BLM and the USFS 
announced guidelines in 2004 to develop and implement stewardship contracts and agreements.  
Stewardship contracts aim to improve forest health and contribute to the development of 
economies.  Guidelines help agencies achieve key land management goals, one of which is the 
reestablishment of native plant species and increased resilience to insects, disease, and other 
natural disturbances.  This enables the BLM and USFS to enter into long-term contracts (up to 
10 years) to meet land management objectives. (USDI, 15 January 2004). 
Although these policy frameworks authorize federal land management agencies to 
encourage the use of native species, practical constraints limit the degree to which federal 
agencies implement native plant policy objectives.  For example, funding restrictions often limit 

21 
 
the agencies’ capability to purchase, store, and successfully establish native seed.  Limited 
supplies and high costs associated with native plant materials make it difficult for agencies to 
purchase native plant materials when funds are insufficient or unavailable. Therefore, many of 
the following policies and programs mentioned seem to be encouraging, although agency 
changes are needed to establish more consistency between native plant policy and practice 
(Richards et al., 1998) 
 
Bureau of Land Management 
The use of native plants for restoration of disturbed wildlands is encouraged through 
various policies and programs of the BLM.  These policies and programs have enabled the BLM, 
who manages 264 million acres of public lands (Davis, 2001), to become the leader in native 
seed purchases among all the land management agencies (Southard, 2002).  Agency policy has 
established important recommendations for the use of native species on all public lands and 
helped to develop important native plant materials to restore plant communities threatened by 
invasive species. 
In accordance with the 1999 Executive Order by President Clinton, the BLM adopted 
policy for noxious weed-free seed in 2006.  Today, all seed used on lands administered by BLM 
is required to be noxious weed-free and meet certified seed quality standards.   Prior to the BLM 
purchasing or accepting seed from any source, all seed must have a valid seed test from a seed 
analyst lab by a registered analyst (BLM, 2007; Native Seed Network, 2008).  However, many 
species officially designated as federally noxious weeds are not listed on state lists (USDA, 24 
May 2008, Plants Database).  Therefore, it could be possible for weed seed that is designated as 
federally noxious to be used within the state. 

22 
 
The BLM Manual 1745 (BLM, 1992) establishes policy and guidance on the 
introduction, transplant, augmentation, and reestablishment of plants (exotic, native, and 
naturalized species) on public lands.  In assessing revegetation needs, natural recovery by native 
plant species is preferable to planting and/or seeding, although, when the potential for recovery 
of native plant species is compromised by the establishment of non-native species, planting 
and/or seeding is acceptable (BLM, 2007).  Planting and/or seeding has become a vital 
component of post-fire rehabilitation efforts and the BLM is directed to reseed burned areas with 
native plant materials which promote wildlife habitat and stabilize eroding soils (Richards et al., 
1998). 
The BLM’s native seed policies and priorities to promote ecosystem health have helped 
to encourage development of various native plant programs.   Although there are many, three of 
the largest BLM programs incorporating the use of native plants include:  Invasive and Noxious 
Weed Program, The Great Basin Restoration Initiative (GBRI), and SOS.  To help support the 
BLM’s plant policies and programs, the National Seed Warehouse located in Boise, Idaho 
purchases, tests, and stores a wide variety of native and introduced seed for several states.  The 
amount of seed each state (Idaho, Oregon, Nevada, Utah, and Colorado) can reserve is based on 
a reasonable projection of annual acreage to be stabilized/rehabilitated over a 5-year period and 
the storage capacity of the warehouse (BLM, 2007). 
To help deal with the rapid expansion of weeds across public lands, the BLM’s Noxious 
Weed Program focuses on controlling and restoring areas degraded by invasive species (BLM, 7 
Dec. 2007, Plant Conservation Program).  “Pulling Together” has become the agency’s national 
strategy for invasive species management.   This strategy calls for effective prevention and 
control of invasive plants and effective restoration of native species which help prevent 

23 
 
reinvasion of non-natives and restore ecosystem function to natural areas, agricultural lands, 
rangelands and forests.  
The GBRI is a team consisting of BLM specialists that work to provide technical 
assistance and obtain funding to support restoration of native plant communities within the Great 
Basin region.  The GBRI focuses on restoring native plant diversity and structure back into 
degraded rangelands and woodlands throughout the Great Basin region.  By doing this it hopes to 
improve resiliency of plant communities and provide critical wildlife and livestock habitat within 
the region.  The GBRI also has encouraged the initiation of smaller, similar projects within the 
Great Basin (Pellant, 2008) including the Great Basin Native Plant Selection and Increase Project 
which aims to increase the availability of native plant materials for restoration of degraded 
rangelands across the Great Basin (GBRI, 2001).  
In 2001, the BLM initiated a native seed collection effort as part SOS.  It has become the 
core of the National Plant Materials Development Program.  The SOS is an ongoing effort aimed 
at improving the health and productivity of public lands through collection, conservation, and 
development of native plant materials used for restoration within the United States.  The BLM 
collections teams, one of which includes the Arboretum at Flagstaff in northern Arizona, gather 
wildland-collected seed for both long-term conservation and immediate restoration needs. The 
program provides native seed from many species of plants to growers, researchers, and 
administrators of seed in the United States (BLM, 2006). 
Within the states of Utah, Nevada, and now Colorado, the BLM has received enough 
demand for seed collection permits that it has developed or is currently developing statewide 
guidance which standardizes seed collection procedures and pricing lists (BLM, 2003).  All BLM 
offices authorize commercial harvesting of native seed and require a permit to collect on public 

24 
 
lands.  Collection must take place in areas outside national monuments, Areas of Critical 
Environmental Concern, and wilderness areas (BLM, 2005). There is currently no national seed 
harvesting guidance which stipulates regulations on wildland collected seed for commercial sale.  
 
National Park Service 
The National Park Service (NPS) may manage native plant species if deemed necessary 
in order to protect park resources in landscapes affected by natural and non-natural disturbances 
and if the practices used will not cause damage to the species or the ecosystem which they rely 
on.  In such instances, restoration and revegetation efforts include the use of seeds, cuttings, or 
transplants representing species as closely related genetically and ecologically to park 
populations as possible and preferable from populations which are in nearest proximity to the 
project area.  Use of exotic species is prohibited within the park and displacement of native 
species by exotics is discouraged (NPS, 2006). 
 In 1996, NPS outlined a Strategic Plan for Managing Invasive Non-native Plants on 
National Park System Lands.  According to the plan, vegetation projects must use locally-grown 
native plant materials where available to maintain genetic and ecological integrity of native 
ecosystems (NPS, 1996).  Programs are in place to provide restoration materials that are specific 
each park.  These programs support greenhouses and gardens which are used to develop locally-
adapted native plant materials which help manage population gene pools (NPS, 1996; NPS, 
2006).  
Harvest of designated species of plants by the public may be allowed on NPS land for an 
authorized purpose or to meet management needs.  The NPS must provide follow-up monitoring 
to determine the impacts of the harvesting activities and ensure that such removals will not cause 

25 
 
unacceptable impacts on natural processes and park resources in order for harvesting to be 
permitted.  Harvest of certain plant parts for personal consumption is specifically authorized by 
the superintendent in accordance with 36 CFR 2.1(c)(1) (NPS, 2006). 
 
Bureau of Indian Affairs 
Although the Bureau of Indian Affairs does not have a specific agency policy focusing 
the use of native plant materials, the BIA must follow the USDI Department Manual 620, 
Chapter 3 and Section 4.2.3 in the Interagency Burn Area Emergency Response Guidebook 
when applying post-fire stabilization seeding treatments.   Seeding treatments may be applied 
only if seeding treatments act to (1) stabilize the site and minimize water or wind erosion, (2) 
reduce the invasion of non-native invasive plants, or (3) prevent critical habitat for federal listed 
threatened or endangered species from being more impaired than if nothing was done (Tom 
Branson, BIA, Personal communication; USDI and USDA, 2006). 
 
USDA Forest Service 
The USFS policies began to address the use of native plant materials for revegetation 
purposes in the 1980s.  Since that time major strides have been made to improve the agency’s 
native plant policies.  Resource managers are now incorporating the use of native species into 
restoration/rehabilitation efforts in order to mitigate effects of mining, road construction and 
maintenance, recreation, and other ground-disturbing activities on native plant communities 
(USFS, 2004).  Programs have been made available to support the increased use of native plant 
materials. 
In 2006, the USFS began developing a new proposed directive to Forest Service Manual 
(FSM) 2070, which addresses the use of native plant materials in the revegetation, restoration, 

26 
 
and rehabilitation of National Forest System lands (USFS, 2006).  The USFS issued a new final 
directive (FSM 2000) to FSM 2070 for native plant materials on February 13, 2008.  FSM 2000 
directs collaboration with federal, state, and local government entities and the public to develop 
and implement actions to increase the availability of native plant materials.  The policy states 
that native plant materials should be the first choice in revegetation of native ecosystems where 
natural regeneration will not occur.  This policy also stresses the importance of genetically 
appropriate native plant materials for restoration (USFS, 2008). 
Recent changes in the Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) policy provide 
direction to restore burned areas with native species when native seed is readily available after 
wildfires.  According to FSM 2523, natural recovery by native species is preferred although 
seeding or planting of grass, forbs, shrubs, or trees can be implemented for emergency 
stabilization, to restore ecosystem structure and function, or to prevent invasion of invasive 
species (USFS, October 2004).  For both short and long-term fire recovery efforts, USFS policies 
encourage the use of native seed, but only where it is “feasible, practical, and affordable” 
(Richards et al., 1998).  
The USFS has been at the forefront in advancing the development of critical restoration 
species.  Since the development of the National Seed Laboratory (NSL) has shifted its focus 
from production of predominately conifer species to restore erodible farm lands to conservation 
and production of native grasses and forbs for habitat restoration (Ledig, 1988; Karrfalt, 2006).  
The NSL focuses its attention on a variety of seed issues including seed dormancy, zoning, 
production, and cleaning.  Its efforts have produced needed protocols for native plant materials 
relating to seed collection, cleaning and long-term storage (Karrfalt, 2006). 

27 
 
The USFS also conducts several rehabilitation and restoration programs to restore 
ecosystem sustainability on Forest Service lands.  Specifically, the USFS Botany Program 
focuses on conservation and management of rare plants, conducting vegetation inventories, and 
increasing production and use of native plant materials for restoration, revegetation, and 
rehabilitation projects on their managed lands.  The Native Plant Materials Program focuses on 
the latter and helps select and develop these materials by determining appropriate plant selection, 
collection techniques, propagation techniques, storage, and planting methodologies (USFS, 
2008).  The National Strategy and Implementation Plan for Invasive Species Management 
incorporates using native or desired non-native materials and prioritizing and developing native 
plant stock that is resistant to invasive pests and pathogens.  This Plan also serves as guidance for 
USFS invasive species management programs that are designed to control, manage, and 
eliminate (where possible) established infestations and reintroduce native plants to restore the 
vegetation (USFS, October 2004). 
The USFS currently sells native seed for harvest under the definition of Special Forest 
Products or Forest Botanical Products using the same regulations as timber sales following 
regulations specified under 36 CFR Chapter 2 Part 223.  Because of recent increases in the sale 
of forest products, a proposed rule to add subparts G and H to 36 CFR Part 223 was put forth in 
the Federal Register on October 22, 2007 concerning sales of forest botanical products (Kim 
Newbauer, USDA Forest Service, Personal Communication).  The proposed rule formally 
establishes a pilot program which charges and collects fees associated with the harvest and sale 
of forest botanical products on national forest lands.  This proposed rule also aims to ensure 
sustainable harvest of those products (Sale and Disposal of National Forest System Timber, 
2007). 

28 
 
Various types of seed harvesting may occur on USFS land; and permit types, costs, and 
stipulations vary by National Forest and Region.  For small scale harvesting activities, the 
purchaser of the special forest product asks permission to harvest, enters into a contract with the 
USFS, or buys a Special Forest Products Permit.  The USFS conducts a competitive bidding 
process for sales of special forest products valued at $10,000 or more (Sale and Disposal of 
National Forest System Timber, 2007).  In either case a review process takes place to ensure that 
National Environmental Protection Act requirements are satisfied and that there are no negative 
impacts associated with the harvesting activity (Kim Newbauer, USDA Forest Service, Personal 
Communication). 
The USFS does not permit collection to occur on sites within off-limit areas, such as in 
Research Natural Areas, sensitive or federally listed plant sites, or other environmentally 
sensitive areas and highly discourages collection of seed in areas occupied by invasive plant 
species.   While harvesting, the amount of seed taken from a given site is limited to no more than 
50 percent of the seed crop in order to encourage natural recruitment of native populations.  The 
USFS also stipulates that collection should be from a minimum of five collection sites at least 
0.5-1.0 mile apart (USFS, 25 March 2008, Celebrating Wildflowers). 
 
Natural Resource Conservation Service 
In 1935 the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), then the Soil 
Conservation Service (SCS), was created in order to deal with the severe soil erosion issues of 
the Dust Bowl Era (Helms, 1992; USDI and USDA, 2002) and the need for plant materials to 
rehabilitate soil ridden lands.  Just two years after, President Roosevelt recommended 
legislation that would allow local landowners to form soil conservation districts. The NRCS 

29 
 
has since developed national standards stressing the use of native species, continued the 
success of the NRCS Plant Materials Centers (PMCs), and created numerous incentive 
programs which increase the use of native species.  Today, nearly 3,000 conservation districts 
have been formed and coordinate involvement between NRCS and local landowners. 
The NRCS National Conservation Practice Standards (CPS) sets forth the minimum 
quality criteria that must be met during the application of all conservation practices.  Most CPS’s 
for vegetation improvement practices emphasize the use of native species when they are 
available.  For example, the CPS for Conservation Cover states that certified seed and 
appropriate native planting stock that is site specific should be used when it is available to meet 
the management objective of reestablishing the native plant community (NRCS, June 2007).  The 
revised standard for Restoration and Management of Declining Habitats provides guidance for 
restoring and conserving rare or declining native plant communities and associated wildlife 
species. 
Plant Materials Centers (PMC) were established throughout the United States with the 
primary focus of providing plant materials to meet conservation program needs (NRCS, 2005).  
By the 1990’s PMC began emphasizing the use of native plant materials for restoration projects 
(Helms, 1992; USDI and USDA, 2002).  The PMC have become the cornerstone of the NRCS 
Plant Materials Program which aims to develop and provide essential knowledge and plant 
materials to solve conservation issues and reestablish ecosystem function on degraded lands. 
Through extensive research the Program develops essential planting and revegetation techniques 
and tests the use of native species to control noxious weeds.  The Program includes a network of 
27 PMCs and associated Plant Materials Specialists and partnered with other federal and state 
agencies as well as non-profit groups to develop needed plant materials and management 

30 
 
practices for current conservation needs (NRCS, 2005).  Through research and development, 
PMCs have supplied new growers with high quality seed stocks.  Within the last 70 years the 
program has released over 600 conservation species, most being grown by commercial growers 
(Undayag and Englert, 2001).  
Several important programs of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 
(Farm Bill) gives cost-share payments to protect and restore natural communities.  These 
programs strongly stress the importance in increased usage of native plant materials (NRCS, 
2002).  For example, the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP) is a voluntary program 
which provides up to 75 percent cost-share assistance to landowners who want to improve and 
protect wildlife habitat on private and Tribal lands.  By 2004, nearly 2.3 million acres were 
enrolled in the program.  Most of WHIP funding has gone toward improving upland wildlife 
habitat, such as native prairie (NRCS, September 2004).  The Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) 
is a similar program which offers landowners a payment of up to 75 percent of the cost 
restoration activities which protect, restore, and enhance wetlands on their property.  In 2007, 
approximately 1,899,979 acres were enrolled in the program (NRCS, April 2007).  The 
Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) is perhaps one of the largest NRCS programs 
with more than 51.5 million acres enrolled in the program.  The EQIP concentrates on improving 
water quality, conserving both ground and surface water, reducing soil erosion from cropland 
and forestland, and improving rangeland.  A payment of up to $450,000 can be given for each 
EQIP contract and since 1996 has obligated $1.08 million dollars to those in the program 
(NRCS, October 2004).   Finally, the Grasslands Reserve Program (GRP) helps landowners 
restore and protect grassland, rangeland, pastureland, shrubland and provides assistance for 

31 
 
rehabilitating grasslands.  This program has enrolled 909,100 acres and has made available $180 
million in financial assistance (NRCS, March 2006). 
Conservation Districts work in conjunction with NRCS but are organized under state and 
tribal law and are directed by locally elected directors or supervisors.  These Districts evaluate 
the conservation needs of their respective areas and create unique partnerships between federal, 
state and local agencies to address local natural resource concerns.  Districts promote and 
provide voluntary compliance with environmental laws by encouraging “best management 
practices.”  
Within the State of Arizona, Natural Resources Conservation Districts (NRCDs) are run 
as a program administered by the State Land Department.  The NRCDs promote the restoration 
and the conservation of land and soil resources within the state.  The NRCD activities include 
soil, water and natural resource conservation, watershed management programs, the protection of 
open space and farmland, and integrated land use planning.  The NRCDs are in partnership with 
NRCS Offices, and play an important role in EQIP by identifying local resources concerns and 
priorities for the grants.  Many are involved with educational centers and have programs 
incorporating at least some use of native plant materials (JLBC, 2007, Project Summary). 
 
Federal Highway Administration 
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has policies for the use native plant 
materials are in place, however, these policies do not require that all federal-aid highway projects 
use native plant materials and instead have made their use an incentive to receive additional 
funding.  Conversely, some programs are available help increase the use of native plant materials 

32 
 
on all FHWA roadways, while other programs make use of “wildflowers” which may not 
necessarily mean those species which are native.   
In 1998, a revised guidance for the native wildflower planting requirement in response to 
the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (STURAA), requires 
that native wildflower seeds and/or seedlings be planted as part of all landscaping projects 
undertaken on the federal-aid highway system.  At least one-quarter of one percent of funds 
expended for landscaping projects must be used to plant native wildflowers on the project site 
unless a waiver has been granted.  The native wildflower planting requirement is applicable to 
only landscaping projects which are meant to improve esthetics of the highway and not to every 
federal-aid highway construction project.  Nevertheless, specifications recommend that native 
wildflower and grass seed mixes be collected and/or grown within the project region and be site 
specific.  Maintaining species diversity is a priority on all projects (Harper-Lore and Wilson, 
2000).  Section 6006 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A 
Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) of 2005 provides new and expanded eligibility for the use of 
federal-aid funds for projects that promote the control of noxious weeds and the use of native 
plant materials for revegetation (FHWA, 2005).  
In following the guidance set forth by the Executive Memorandum on Beneficial 
Landscaping and Executive Order 13112 the FHWA maintains a Roadside Vegetation Program.  
This program acts as a holistic approach to roadside management and incorporates the use of 
native vegetation to improve water quality and erosion control, increases wildlife habitat and 
control noxious weeds all roadsides (Harper-Lore and Wilson, 2000).  Meanwhile, FHWAs 
Operation Wildflower Program, while sounding beneficial, may introduce species that are not 
necessarily native to the project area.  This program is a volunteer cooperative agreement 

33 
 
between the National Council of State Garden Clubs, Inc., state highway agencies, and FHWA 
which allows state garden clubs to pay for or furnish wildflower seeds or seedlings to a state 
highway agency for planting within the highway right-of-way.  Federal funds are available for 
participation in the cost of planting and maintaining wildflowers supplied by state garden clubs 
and other organizations along roadsides (FHWA, 24 February 2003, Wildflowers).   
 
Arizona State Mandates 
 
No general native seed policy exists within the State of Arizona, but specific policies 
exist for seed labeling requirements and include labeling for native seed.  Within the Arizona 
Revised Statues, the Arizona Seed Law mentions only agricultural, vegetable, and ornamental 
seeds, although some laws may still apply to native seed.  In accordance with §3-235 of the 
Arizona Seed Law, an Arizona seed dealer or an out-of-state seed dealer who sells, 
distributes, processes, or mixes seed for the use of others must obtain a license from the 
environmental services division of the Arizona department of agriculture.  §3-237 of the 
Arizona Seed Law specifies seed labeling requirements which include: (1) germination, (2) 
purity, (3) noxious weed content, (4) precautionary statements the director considers to be 
necessary, (5) labeler or packager information, and (6) seed origin. 
 
As a funding requirement of the State Wildlife Grants program, Congress charged each of 
the 56 States and Territories with developing a statewide “Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation 
Strategy” (CWCS).  Arizona’s CWCS is a comprehensive document that plans for conserving 
fish, wildlife, and wildlife habitats over a ten year period (2005-2015).  There are eight required 
elements of the CWCS.  The fourth element of the CWCS describes conservation strategies to 
conserve habitats which will benefit wildlife communities.  One specific strategy calls for efforts 

34 
 
which will limit the spread of invasive plants and promote the restoration of native vegetation in 
disturbed areas (AZGFD, 2006). 
In 2007, the Arizona Invasive Species Advisory Council (AISAC) began developing a 
comprehensive statewide invasive species management plan for Arizona and is to be completed 
in June 2008.  One of the objectives of the Council is to recommend specific actions/needs to 
state agencies including the Arizona Game and Fish Department, and the Arizona Department of 
Agriculture, regarding prevention, response, control, management, restoration, and other areas 
based on the prioritization (AISAC, 2007). 
 
Arizona Game and Fish Department 
 
The Arizona Game and Fish Department (AZGFD) is a state entity, and, therefore, must 
follow all policies set forth by the State of Arizona (mentioned above).  A major task of the 
AZGFD is to conserve, enhance, and restore native wildlife and their associated habitats.  Use of 
native plant species for restoration is of major importance.  Although the AZGFD receives no 
money from the state’s general fund like most other states agencies, the Arizona Revised Statutes 
§17-405 of the Arizona Game and Fish Laws and Rules allows AZGFD to accept federal aid and 
grant funding for restoration and wildlife habitat restoration and enhancement projects (AZGFD, 
2007).   The AZGFD receives the majority of its funding for habitat restoration projects through 
Senate Bill 1441 (SB 1441) Wildlife Habitat Restoration and Enhancement Funds.  Fund monies 
are appropriated by the state legislature as a give-back for money taken out of the AZGFD 
budget in a previous deficit cycle.  The AZGFD also uses Wildlife Conservation Fund revenues 
for these projects.  Other monies for restoration projects are appropriated through the Pittman-
Robertson/Dingell-Johnson (PRDJ) Special Line Item.  The PRDJ provides the state’s matching 

35 
 
funds for federal funds used for wildlife habitat restoration projects, hunter education programs, 
and wildlife population surveys (JLBS, 2007, AZGFD).  The Heritage Fund is also critical in 
providing the Department with the needed funds to assist in the recovering of Arizona’s native 
wildlife and associated habitats (AZGFD, 2 May 2008, Heritage Fund Program). 
 
Arizona Department of Transportation 
Projects located within Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) jurisdiction must 
develop and implement a Stormwater Pollution Protection Plan (SWPPP) which includes 
completed Permanent Pollution Prevention Best Management Practices (BMPs).  Described 
within the Permanent Pollution Prevention BMPs is the reestablishment of vegetation to 
disturbed soils.  Revegetation must be conducted in accordance with the criteria established in 
ADOT Stored Specification 805SEED: Item 8050003 Seeding (ADOT, 3 December 2007, 
Stormwater Requirements for External Parties).  Work under ADOT Stored Specification 
805SEED consists of furnishing all revegetation materials, preparing the soil, applying Class II 
seed (seed for range grass, flowers or shrubs with mulching), and establishing seed on all 
disturbed or non-vegetated areas.  Seed supplied to ADOT must be tested and labeled in 
accordance with the Arizona Revised Statues and the USDA rules and regulations under the 
Federal Seed Act (ADOT, 2005).  A uniform perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70% of 
the native background vegetative cover must be established in order for projects to met the 
requirement for “Final Stabilization” and submit a Notice of Termination (ADOT, 2006). 
Beginning in 1992 ADOT required the use of only native species for revegetation on 
disturbed project areas.  All seeding is completed by subcontractors.  Before the seed is applied 

36 
 
to the project area, ADOT checks that the environment condition from which the seed is 
collected matches that of the site (LeRoy Brady, ADOT, Pers comm.). 
Seed Certification – Arizona Crop Improvement Association 
Demand for native plant materials has led to an increase in seed certification, particularly 
in the western United States.  The purpose of seed certification is to verify source of the seed, 
preserve genetic purity and identity, and prevent the spread of noxious weeds.  Seed certifcation 
has become a vital component to the increased success of revegetation projects. The Arizona 
Crop Improvement Association, Inc. (ACIA) is designated as an official seed certifying agency 
for Arizona in accordance to §3-232 of the Arizona Seed Law.   The ACIA’s seed certifying 
activities meet or exceed the standards and procedures specified in Part 201.68 through 201.78 of 
the Federal Seed Act (7 U.S.C. 1551 (a)(25) (ACIA, 2007).  As an official member of the 
Association of Official Seed Certifying Agencies (AOSCA), ACIA is given the authority to 
certify seed within its jurisdictions according to AOSCA standards (AOSCA, 2007) and only 
those crop varieties that are accepted by the ACIA, in accordance with the criteria established by 
the AOSCA, are eligible for certification.   
Because of the increasing demand for native plant materials for restoration, revegetation 
and stabilization of natural communities, AOSCA has implemented certification requirements 
and standards that accommodate plant germplasm (those not yet released as formal varieties) of 
native grasses, forbs and woody plants.  As an alternative to formal variety release, AOSCA Pre-
Variety Germplasm (PVG) categories facilitate procurement, production, and distribution of 
plant germplasm materials (AOSCA, Native Plant Connection Bulletin).  Pre-Variety 
Germplasm certification has became essential in assuring genetic integrity of native seeds on the 
market, and is an important tool used to preserve native plant populations.  The Arizona Crop

Improvement Association has adopted all AOSCA standards for certification of plant germplasm 
types. 
The AOSCA seed certification agencies require seed collectors/producers to follow 
specified requirements and procedures which vary depending on whether the certification is for 
wildland collected seed or for field/nursery production (AOSCA, Native Plant Connection 
Bulletin).  Germplasm originating from a wildland stand is assigned a genetic status of either 

39 
 
“manipulated-track” or “natural-track” (Figure 3.2).  Germplasm accessions that are an 
unrestricted representation of an intact wildland plant population on the original site follow 
natural-track certification procedures.  When natural-track germplasm is increased in the field, 
genetic manipulation the species must be avoided.  Germplasm accessions which are 
purposefully or inadvertently hybridized with other accessions or selected for distinctive traits 
within the population are routed to the manipulated-track (AOSCA, Native Plant Connection 
Bulletin). 
 According to  AOSCA certification standards a race or ecotype of native or naturalized 
species following either track may be categorized into one of three PVG classes: (1) Source 
Identified Class (unevaluated germplasm identified only as to species and location of the wild 
growing parents), (2) Selected Class Seed (germplasm showing promise of desirable traits, 
having been selected either within or as a common site comparison among accessions or 
populations of the same species), and (3) Tested Class Seed (germplasm for which progeny 
testing has proven desirable traits to be heritable).  The progression through the PVG categories 
may lead to formal Variety/Cultivar release, which includes seed certification generation 
designations of Breeder (seed directly controlled by the originating or sponsoring plant breeding 
organization), Founder (the progeny of Breeder or Foundation seed handled to maintain specific 
genetic purity and identity), Registered (the progeny of Breeder or Foundation seed handled to 
maintain satisfactory genetic purity and identity), and Certified seed (the progeny of Breeder, 
Foundation or Registered seed handled to maintain satisfactory genetic purity and identity) 
(ACIA, 2007; AOSCA, Native Plant Connection Bulletin).  Seeds of all weeds classified as 
“noxious” (seeds of perennial or annual weeds which, when established, are highly destructive 
and difficult to control by ordinary good cultural practices) are prohibited by ACIA standards 

40 
 
from any class of certified seed.  Pre-Variety Germplasm tags are color coded according to 
category with specific generation information listed on the PVG tag; yellow for Source Identified 
Seed, green for Selected Seed, and blue for Tested Seed.  Variety/Cultivar tags are color coded to 
signify generation; white for Breeder and Foundation, purple for Registered, and blue for 
Certified.  (AOSCA, Native Plant Connection Bulletin).   
It appears that the seed certification process is a practical way for seed buyers to be 
assured genetic identity and purity of plant materials of either variety or cultivar release.  
Although the process of PVG certification is relatively new, PVG certified seed have been 
incorporated into revegetation projects across the West.  Seed warehouses including those 
operated by the BLM located in Ephraim, Utah and Boise, Idaho continue to increase seed 
storage of PVG certified seed. 
Cost associated with seed field inspection and certification vary depending on the type of 
certification, size of field, distance the field inspector must travel, pounds of seed, and the 
number of lots to be certified (Table 3.2).   The ACIA is a non-profit organization, operated 
solely on membership and service fees.  Individuals requiring field inspection services pay an 
annual membership fee before services are rendered.   Field inspection fees are charged on a per 
acre basis and require reimbursement of travel expenses (mileage/lodging) to be paid when 
necessary.  Depending on the type of certification desired (Variety/Cultivar or PVG) seeds are 
either sent to a certified lab for testing or immediately bagged according to PVG certification 
type.  All Variety/Cultivar seed harvested for legal sale must be tested by an approved seed 
testing laboratory in order to verify seed germination and purity as well as the presence of weed 
seeds and other seed factors required for the specified label.

Therefore, certified seeds are usually of higher quality and purity and have greater germination 
potential (Dunne, 2002).  A seed analysis certificate is then verified by ACIA and the 
certification class is printed on the certification label.  If field inspections are completed for PVG 
tags (e.g. Source Identified Class), seeds are not tested and tags are acquired at a reduced cost 
(Carrel Loveless, ACIA, Personal Communication). Official certification labels must be attached 
to each package of seed at the time it is offered for sale (ACIA, 2007).

In summation, native plant policies have strengthened since the 1980’s, and the increased 
threat of non-native species invasions and the need to protect the genetic integrity of native palnt 
population has made the use of native species and seed certification important.   However, these 
policies seem to be inconsistent across agency boundaries.  As large-scale disturbances continue 
to increase within the West, the use of locally-adapted plant materials will be vital in restoring 
native plant community structure, function, and resilience to a changing climate.  In addition, 

43 
 
ecological research appears to have a strong influence on native seed policy.  Federal and state 
programs have been an effective method in providing the research needed to initiate policy 
changes.  Therefore, it would be useful to appropriate funds to increase programs which conduct 
research relating to the development of locally-native plant materials.    A focus needs to be 
made on making native plant and seed certification policies more consistent among agencies.   
 
IV. Assessment of Current and Future Native Plant Materials Market Concerns and Needs 
  In recent years, large-scale restoration projects have increased due to an increase in 
disturbance events throughout northern Arizona.  Federal, state, private, and non-profit 
organizations are experiencing the need for locally-adapted native plant materials to restore these 
disturbed areas.  Although research has increased the amount of information and tools available 
for native plant material production, there remains a limited supply of native plant materials in 
northern Arizona.  Stronger policies emphasizing the use of native plant materials have 
encouraged collaborative efforts among agencies and organizations to carry out continued 
research and development of native plant materials. These groups have acted as models which 
helped to create regional native plant development efforts and have provided information 
important to the initiation of a native plant market within northern Arizona. However, demand 
and supply surveys developed to assess the opportunity for market initiation within the region 
identified various limiting factors to consider before moving forward with its development.  
Furthermore, although native plant cooperatives and groups outside northern Arizona act as 
important models, the region’s extreme environmental conditions pose major challenges to 
native plant production, and a more diverse approach to initiating a native plant market may be 
needed.   

44 
 
Current and Ongoing Restoration Projects in Northern Arizona 
Over the last several years, the number of large-scale restoration projects within northern 
Arizona has increased.   Many of the projects have been initiated to restore ecologically degraded 
landscapes, and a heavy focus has been placed on improving native plant and wildlife 
communities’ structure and function.  Federal, state, private, and non-profit entities have 
partnered to pool the resources needed to initiate local restoration efforts.  Excluding post-fire 
rehabilitation efforts, over 29,500 acres have been or are in the process of being restored and/or 
improved since 2005.   Total restoration project acreage is undoubtedly higher as estimates on 
some projects were not available for this study.  
 
Bureau of Land Management 
As a result of several major fires occurring within the Mojave Desert in 2005 and 2006, 
the BLM took action to accelerate vegetative recovery in burned Mojave Desert Tortoise 
(Gopherus agassizii) critical habitat through a variety of treatments.  Rehabilitation of the 
105,083 acres burned within the Pakoon Basin, located within Grand Canyon-Parashant National 
Monument in northwest Arizona, has been a high priority to the BLM Arizona Strip District.  In 
2006, the BLM aerially applied a seed mix of native species to 34,099 burned acres in Pakoon 
Basin.  In 2007, approximately 8,389 acres were reseeded, and the BLM incorporated seed on 
158 acres of the reseeded areas by dragging small bushy trees and shrubs over the seeded areas.  
All seed purchased for the project came from several different vendors at a national seed buy.  
Monitoring sites have been developed to evaluate effectiveness of seeding (Kathleen Harcksen, 
BLM, pers comm.).   
 

45 
 
United States Fish and Wildlife Service 
The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has been involved with the BLM 
in the Pakoon Springs Restoration Project located within Pakoon Basin.  Pakoon Springs is the 
largest collection of springs within the Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument.  This 
project involves approximately 70 to 80 acres of restoration work to rehabilitate and enhance 
native biodiversity, ecological function, and natural flow regimes back into the drainage and 
reestablishment of cottonwoods willows around several ponds.   
The USFWS is also working within the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area on a 
proposed project to remove tamarisk at one or more sites on the Colorado River.  They will 
attempt to replace disturbed areas with native cottonwoods and willows (William Austin, 
USFWS, pers comm.). 
 
Grand Canyon National Park 
Current projects incorporating the use of native plant materials inside Grand Canyon 
National Park (GCNP) consist mostly of revegetation in areas disturbed by roadway construction 
activities.   Native plant materials collected within the park are used to mitigate negative effects 
of construction activities on native vegetation.  Exotic species removal also plays an important 
role in restoring native ecosystems within the park.  Ideally, areas where exotics have been 
removed should be revegetated with native species.  However, the amount of materials needed 
for revegetation of these areas not available.  The GCNP is currently working on increasing 
production of native plant materials and developing a reliable native seed source.  In order to 
accomplish this goal, there is an increased effort for collection of native seed grown in native 
seed fields (Janice Busco, GCNP, pers comm.). 

46 
 
Arizona Game and Fish Department 
Over the last several years the AZGFD has initiated a variety of wildlife habitat 
improvement projects in northern Arizona.  In 2007, declining mule deer winter range quality, 
specifically the reduction of critical winter browse shrubs led to the implementation of the 
Westside Winter Range Project on the North Kaibab Ranger District.   This project has 
implemented several treatment types focusing on seed bed preparation, minimizing soil 
disturbance, and follow-up weed treatments.  During October 2005 to April 2007, 24,000 acres 
were cleared and 500 acres were seeded with four locally collected shrub species: cliffrose 
(Pushia Mexicana var. stansburiana), sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), fourwing saltbush (Atriplex 
canescens), and winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata) to help improve mule deer winter forage 
species.  Approximately 250 acres of follow-up herbicide treatments were completed.  An 
additional 900 acres are to be seeded with locally collected shrubs in 2008.  This project is likely 
to continue for 5-10 years and will involve multiple research and monitoring projects to evaluate 
effectiveness of treatments within the seeded acreage (Andi Rogers, AZGFD, Personal 
Communication). 
Since 2002, woodland/grassland restoration treatments have been ongoing in the 
Anderson Mesa area which is located just southeast of Flagstaff.  As a part of the Anderson Mesa 
Pronghorn Antelope Management Plan which incorporates collaboration among agency 
personnel, non-profit organizations, private citizens, and students, the AZGFD’s Anderson Mesa 
Habitat Project aims to improve winter habitat range for declining pronghorn populations (Clark, 
2006).  Seeding of native shrub species within the project area by the AZGFD started in 2006.  
To date, the AZGFD has seeded approximately 555 acres within burn pile sites on private land.  
Total acreage seeded with native species within the greater Anderson Mesa area since 2002 by 

47 
 
both the AZGFD and USFS equals approximately 2,908 acres (Diablo Trust, 2005). This project 
is expected to continue until fall 2009.   
Additionally, approximately two acres of restoration and forage seeding is expected to 
take place at Raymond Wildlife Area during the summer of 2008.  The seeded areas will serve as 
plots which would then act as an additional source of native seed to be used on future restoration 
projects within the region (Rick Miller, AZGFD, Personal Communication).  Furthermore, the 
AZGFD Habitat Program has been also working towards restoration of native vegetation within 
post-fire burns crucial to wintering mule deer on the Kaibab National Forest. 
 
Arizona Department of Transportation  
Since 2003, non-native species populations have grown significantly along ADOT rights-
of-way, specifically I-17 and I-40.   From January 1, 2006 to June 30, 2006, 912 acres of noxious 
weeds were treated in northern Arizona.  This showed an increase from the 875 acres treated 
during the same time in 2005 and 481 acres treated during that time in 2004.  Arizona 
Department of Transportation continues to monitor and treat infestations annually by hand 
pulling, biological controls, herbicides, and native plant seeding through its Integrated Weed 
Management Program (ADOT, 2 May 2008, Current Flagstaff Projects).  Every year ADOT 
oversees construction, reconstruction, and maintenance of approximately 6,000 12’ lane miles 
within the Flagstaff and Holbrook Districts alone (ADOT, 2 May 2008, District Information).  
Due to current policies, certified native seed is used to revegetate all areas which have been 
disturbed due to work associated with these roadways.

Northern Arizona University 
The Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI), an independent research branch of Northern 
Arizona University (NAU), completes ecologically based restoration in order to reestablish 
ecosystem function of Southwestern forests.  The ERI is an active member in the Northern 
Arizona Native Seed Alliance and is involved in several studies incorporating the use and need 
for native plant materials.  Northern Arizona University also presents students with an 
opportunity to engage in ecologically-based research within the region, some of which involves 
restoration.  Specifically, studies that incorporate the use of native plant materials include 
riparian restoration, landscaping, and effects of seeding on disturbed ecosystems are currently in 
place.  
 
Grand Canyon Trust 
The Grand Canyon Trust’s (GCT) Restoration Program is among several other programs 
which act to protect and restore the Colorado Plateau.  This program has initiated a multitude of 
projects to help restore native plant communities within the region including: invasive species 
removal, wildlife habitat improvement, fire rehabilitation, understory vegetation management, 
watershed management, and restoration of native plant and wildlife communities within Kane 
and Two Mile Ranches.  In 2005, the GCT and The Conservation Fund jointly purchased Kane 
and Two Mile ranches located north of the Grand Canyon at the eastern end of the Arizona Strip.   
Both ranches have presented the GCT with the opportunity to expand on ground restoration and 
science-based research. The GCT’s activities within ponderosa pine forests, shrublands, and 
grasslands of the southern Colorado Plateau focus on restoring composition, structure, and 
natural processes these ecosystem types (GCT, 2 May 2008, Restoration Programs).

   Arizona Native Plant Society 
 
The Arizona Native Plant Society (AZNPS) has recently become involved in the Plant 
Atlas of Arizona Project.  This project is a statewide effort to gather scientific documentation of 
plant diversity throughout Arizona.  Research will build on current botanical collections and 
focus on areas where collections have been limited.  The project hopes to provide more accurate 
and detailed geographic information on the flora within Arizona to the public and land managers.  
To assist in the effort, AZNPS members will be trained on techniques used to collect voucher 
specimens of native plants and record field data throughout the state.  The botanical information 
obtained will help restorationists identify specific location of plant species within the state (Jessa 
Fisher, AZNPS, pers comm.). 
 
Nature Conservancy 
        
The Nature Conservancy’s Hart Prairie Preserve, located in northern Arizona, 
encompasses 245 acres and contains one the largest rare Bebb willow (Salix bebbiana) 
communities in the United States.  Therefore, goals of Hart Prairie aim to not only enhance 
viability of this rare stand, but also to conserve and restore ecological health of the preserve as a 
whole.  Native plant seeding has been done in the past for rehabilitation of disturbed areas within 
the Preserve.  Conservation work at Hart Prairie Preserve “is scheduled to continue for the 
foreseeable future” (TNC, 2 May 2008, Conservation Work at Hart Prairie Preserve).   
 
The Greater Flagstaff Forests Partnership           
The Greater Flagstaff Forests Partnership (GFFP), a cooperative effort with the USFS, is 
dedicated to restoring ecological health of northern Arizona forests.  During the next ten years, 

50 
 
GFFP will undertake annual projects to restore forest health and reduce fire risk within the 
Flagstaff Urban Wildland Interface (approximately 180,000 acres).  Future understory restoration 
projects taken on by the GFFP hope to emphasize the reestablishment of native plant 
communities (GFFP, 2 May 2008, A Guide to the Greater Flagstaff Forests).  
 
Current Native Plant Materials Availability in Northern Arizona 
Native plant material availability within northern Arizona is limited, and no large-scale 
seed companies exist within the region.  Only a hand-full of small local nurseries are currently in 
the business of selling native plant materials and native plant seed.  Flagstaff Native Plant & 
Seed (FNPS) in Flagstaff, Arizona currently sells locally-adapted native plant materials which 
are adapted to the Colorado Plateau, some of which are source-identified.   Flagstaff Native Plant 
& Seed caters to both wholesale and retail markets, however, the majority of its wholesale 
products go to landscapers, and only minimal quantities (less than 5%) are sold to the USFS and 
NPS for restoration purposes (Nigel Sparks, FNPS, Personal communication).  Other nurseries in 
Flagstaff and Clarkdale sell native plant materials which may or may not come from local 
genetic sources.  Overall, the amount of native plant materials available is only adequate to 
support small-scale (less than 25 acres) projects within the region.   
The Arboretum at Flagstaff ‘s native plant materials are largely used for restoration 
projects on its associated properties.  Recently, a joint project among the Coconino, Kaibab, and 
Prescott National Forests, The Arboretum at Flagstaff, and the Museum of Northern Arizona has 
worked toward creating a source of local genotype native seed for restoration projects on federal 
and private lands within northern Arizona (Kristin Haskins, Arboretum at Flagstaff, Personal 
Communication).  The project, funded by the USFS in 2007, hopes to build a sustainable native 

51 
 
plant program on the Coconino, Kaibab, and Prescott National Forests and provide baseline data 
regarding native species, their collection, and cultivation.  Because of the lack of proper 
equipment, local companies have found it difficult to harvest and process native seed.  Through 
this project needed seed production equipment has been purchased, and with the hiring of a 
program coordinator, large-scale (greater than 25 acres) native seed collections with the region 
have been completed.  To date, seeds from approximately 40 native species have been collected, 
and three seedbeds at The Arboretum have been constructed to cultivate and increase locally-
collected native species.  Seeds from the increased seed stock will be used in revegetation or 
outgrown in other facilities to increase the amounts of locally-collected seeds (Coconino 
National Forest, 2007). 
Several government agencies, such as the NPS and the USFS, contract with the NRCS 
Plant Material Center (PMC) in Los Lunas, New Mexico to research and develop native plant 
materials for use in restoration after disturbance events within the region.   NRCS PMCs have 
the ability to cooperate with public, private, commercial, and tribal partners and land managers 
to restore ecosystems using native plant material. The Los Lunas PMC provides information on 
plant material production as well as providing assistance in propagating local genotype plant 
materials for restoration projects.  By contracting with Los Lunas PMC, seeds collected from 
local sources are established in seed production fields or propagated as seedlings and 
transplanted into fields at the PMC.  These native plant materials are then sent back to restore the 
specified project area (NRCS, 2000).   However, because of costs associated with contracting 
(cleaning, inventorying, storing, propagating, and labor), development of native plant resources 
to be used on large-scale restoration projects within the region may be infeasible. Cost associated 
with contracting often increases as production difficulty increases.  For example, according to 

52 
 
contracting cost-estimate matrices developed for Montana’s NRCS Bridger PMC, the cost of 
production for small field of grass which has a low production difficulty rating is approximately 
$35.00 per pound.  The same small field of a grass which has a high production difficulty rating 
is approximately $100.00 per pound. 
As mentioned previously, NPS vegetation projects must use locally-grown native plant 
materials when available (NPS, 1996).  Native plant materials used for restoration projects in 
Grand Canyon National Park are collected and propagated within the Park, although, the 
materials produced are to be used specifically for Park projects. 
Many Conservation Districts offer a Native Plant Program which makes native seed or 
plants available to the public.  Although the Coconino Natural Resource Conservation District 
does not currently supply native plant materials, a program is being developed to establish the 
means to provide these materials (Mark Jalving, pers comm.). 
 
Current Harvesting and Propagation Techniques for Native Plant Materials 
A large amount of literature exists about native plant materials production, specifically, 
information concerning harvesting and propagation techniques of such materials. Over the course 
of many years native seed producers have begun to use available agriculture equipment for 
native seed production.  In addition, extensive research has made development of needed native 
plant materials production equipment and techniques possible. Although specific techniques 
involved in the native plant materials production process may vary, critical components include: 
seed harvesting, cleaning, storage, propagation, and production.  When done correctly seed 
purity and viability is increased and therefore more marketable. 
 

53 
 
Seed Harvesting 
Timing of seed harvest varies among native plant species and is highly dependent upon 
their origin, seed maturity rates, climate conditions, and method of harvest (Tucson PMC, 2004; 
Horton et al. 1990).  Timing of seedhead maturity tends to vary (Horton et al., 1990), however, 
on average, seed maturity takes approximately 30 days from the time of pollination (Tucson 
PMC, 2004).  During this time seeds go through several maturity stages; milk, soft dough, 
medium dough, hard dough, and mature.  For most species, seed development between the 
medium dough and the mature stage can take a few days to a couple of weeks.  Therefore, timing 
of harvest is critical (Revegetation Equipment Catalog, 26 April 2008).  Seed harvest is most 
ideal when seeds are at the medium to hard dough or mature stage.  Seeds collected too early 
(milk-soft dough stage) will experience poor germination rates, while the highest germination 
rates and storage capability occur at the hard to mature seed stage.  (Tucson PMC, 2004).  
Generally, once the first seeds begin to release the majority of the seeds are ready for harvesting 
(Stevens et al., 1996).    
With the use of commercial machinery, a variety of seed harvesting techniques make it 
possible for large-scale harvest of seeds during different stages of seed maturity.  Seed 
harvesting techniques can vary depending on seed type and size.  Direct combining allows 
harvest to be completed in one operation and is the method most often used to harvest seed from 
species with uniform maturity rates and height (Horton et al., 1990; Stevens et al., 1996).  The 
direct combining method requires seeds to be at the hard dough or mature stage.  Swathing is a 
technique in which desired fields are cut, and the crop is then placed into a windrow to further 
ripen before being combined.  Swathing allows harvesting of seed at the medium to hard dough 
stages and is most used to harvest species with shatter prone seeds (Tucson PMC, 2004; Horton 

54 
 
et al., 1990).  Swathing followed by combining is common for harvesting grass seed and species 
whose seeds mature unevenly (Horton et al. 1990; Stevens et al., 1996).  
Stripping of seed heads by hand or machine (brush harvester/strippers) is commonly used 
to harvest species with light and chaffy seeds, species with long awns or pubescence, species 
whose seeds mature unevenly, or species which are indeterminate (Revegetation Equipment 
Catalog, 26 April 2008; Scianna and Majerus, 2002; Tucson PMC 2004).  Vacuum units can also 
be used to harvest light and chaffy seeded species (Revegetation Equipment Catalog, 26 April 
2008).  Stripping collects mature seed from the plant and leaves immature seed which is 
collected later when those seeds are fully mature (Tucson PMC, 2004).  Hand stripping of seeds 
is used for wildland collections or shrubs.  Various hand-powered seed strippers or brushes are 
available for harvesting of some grass and forb species.  Seeds, berries, or fruit from most shrubs 
are collected into bags, baskets or tubs.   Use of collector hoops in combination with badminton 
or tennis rackets can also be used (Revegetation Equipment Catalog, 26 April 2008).  
 
Seed Cleaning 
While harvesting, contaminants such as weed seed, other crop seed, and material such as 
stems, leaves and immature and broken seed also get collected. These impurities can be 
separated from the desired crop seed by various seed processing machines.  Desired seed can 
then be separated further based on physical properties such as size, weight, surface texture and 
shape.   Conditioning or pre-cleaning removes excessive materials prior to cleaning, minimizes 
seed loss, and improves cleaning efficiency (Tucson PMC, 2004).  The primary machines used 
for conditioning or pre-cleaning are scalpers, debearders, hammermills and huller scarifiers 
(Tucson PMC 2004; Revegetation Equipment Catalog, 26 April 2008).   

55 
 
The most commonly used method of seed cleaning for many grasses, forbs, and shrubs is 
through the use of air-screen separators. Air-screen separators use a combination of air, gravity, 
and screens to separate seed based on their size, shape, and density.  Other seed machines which 
separate seed based on these properties include: gravity separators, velvet rolls, spiral and indent 
cylinders, indent disks, magnetic separators, and vibrator separators, along with many others 
(Revegetation Equipment Catalog, 26 April 2008).   
 
Seed Storage 
Proper storage plays a key role in maintaining seed viability.  The percent moisture at 
which to store seeds in bulk varies.  In general native seed at 10-15% moisture is considered safe 
for storage (Tucson PMC, 2004; Horton et al., 1990; Stevens et al., 1996).  Seeds kept dry and 
stored under cool low humidity conditions maintain optimal seed viability and germination 
(Tucson PMC, 2004; Horton et al., 2004).  Under these conditions seeds can stay viable for up to 
3 years in storage (Stevens et al., 1996) or longer. 
 
Propagation Techniques 
Some species can be propagated either from seed or vegetatively.  Seed propagation 
requirements depend on the species.  Some species can be directly seeded while others may 
require pre-treatment in order to break seed dormancy prior to germination.  Seed pre-treatments 
involve stratification, scarification, or a combination of both.  Stratification is the process of 
subjecting seeds to warm/moist or cool/moist temperatures.  Seeds are placed in a moist medium 
and stored under one or a combination of stratification conditions for several weeks or in some 
cases several months.  Scarification is used for species with hard seed coats and involves 

56 
 
methods which degraded the seed coat by scratching, abrasion, or soaking in acid (Native Plants 
Network, 13 March 2008).   
Many species, especially those that root easily, can be vegetatively propagated by leaf, 
stem, or root cuttings.  This method is preferred when seeds are limited, have low viability, or 
have long dormancy periods (Scianna and Majerus, 2002; Native Plant Network, 13 March 
2008).  Dormant cuttings root well after soaking for 48 hours immediately after removal from the 
parent plant (Scianna, 1996). 
Propagation protocols have been established for many native plant species which grow in 
northern Arizona.  These protocols specify ideal propagation techniques for the specified species 
and include recommendations for pre-treatments and planting techniques or requirements.  The 
Native Plants Propagation Protocol Database is a searching database of propagation protocols for 
native plants of North America (http://nativeplants.for.uidaho.edu/network/).   Many NRCS Plant 
Materials Centers have also published extensive literature on techniques and requirements for 
native plant species propagation, seeding, and planting (http://plant-materials.nrcs.usda.gov/).   
 
Seeding Techniques 
Seeding techniques can vary depending of species growth habits (grass, forb, shrub, or 
tree).  To obtain optimum seed germination and growth rates, properly selected fields should 
contain no weeds and have well-drained soils (Stevens et al., 1996).  Direct seeding consists of 
sowing harvested seeds directly into a seedbed, either in growth containers in a greenhouse or in 
fields.  Most shrubs and some forbs can be directly sown into a properly selected and prepared 
field.  For species that are not affected by transplanting shock can have seeds germinated in a 
greenhouse (Scianna and Majerus, 2002) and be planted as containerized transplants in the field 

57 
 
(Native Plants Network, 13 March 2008).  Many grasses are successfully germinated by using 
the broadcast seeding technique, in which seed is scattered over the soil surface.  When using 
this technique it is essential to ensure good seed to soil contact.  This technique is not desirable 
when the weather is hot and dry and/or the soil moisture content is low (Tucson PMC, 2004).   
Accurate seeding rates and proper contact between the soil and seed helps to increase 
seed germination and competition with weeds.  A large variety of seeding equipment (Spreaders, 
Seeders, Drills, Planters, Rollers, and Packers) is available to deliver seeds at an accurate, 
uniform rate, and even depth and provide proper soil contact (Horton et al., 1990).  It is 
recommended that seeding rates be applied for Pure Live Seed (PLS) which is the purity and 
germination of seed expressed in percent.  A seeding rate of 30 to 50 PLS is recommended, with 
larger seeds sown at up to 30 PLS per linear foot and smaller seeds sown at approximately 50 
PLS per linear foot.  Recommended seeding rates for forb species is 10-25 PLS per linear foot 
(Tucson PMC, 2004; Scianna and Majerus, 2002).    
Ideal seeding depths range from one-quarter to one inch.  Seeding depths of one-quarter 
to one-half inch are recommended for smaller seeds, for instance, perennial grasses (Tucson 
PMC, 2004; Horton et al., 1990).  Proper seeding depths for forb and shrub species range from 
one-eighth inch for small seeds and one-half inch for larger seeds (Steven’s et al., 1996). The 
range of seeding depths is often influenced by soil type/structure and seed size.  For example, 
planting of seeds in the one-quarter to one-half inch range is ideal for sowing in heavier soils 
whereas recommendations for seeds sown in lighter soils specify depths closer to one inch 
(Tucson PMC, 2004).  Most native plants will have higher seed yield in wider row spacing.  Row 
spacing highly depends on available equipment, the species, and water availability (Tucson 
PMC, 2004; Horton et al., 1990).   

58 
 
Germination requirements, which vary according to species will determine the most ideal 
time for seeding (Stevens et al. 1996).  Seeding is optimum when adequate moisture is present to 
ensure seedling establishment (Horton et al. 1990).  For the northern Arizona region this occurs 
in early spring or late summer to fall.  For forbs and shrubs, seeds that require stratification 
(moist, cool treatment) or scarification (scratching to break the seed coat), or for seeds that are 
slow to establish are best planted in the late fall.  Seeds with rapid germination rates can be 
planted in early spring, late summer, or late fall when adequate moisture is available and plants 
have time to establish before the onset of extreme summer heat or frost (Stevens et al., 1996).  
Irrigation and fertilization can help improve germination success, seedling establishment, and 
seed yield (Stevens et al., 1996; Horton et al., 1990) when weather conditions are not optimal. 
Weed control during seedling establishment is also recommended. 
In conclusion, proper native plant material production techniques have been improved, 
and the equipment needed for production exists.  Within northern Arizona, a handful of facilities 
and mechanisms are available to collect, store and/or propagate native plant materials.  However, 
the amount of land capable of agricultural development is inadequate which makes large-scale 
native plant materials production difficult.   Furthermore, seed collection and processing 
equipment are the most limited within the region.  It may be that agencies and organizations have 
not purchased this equipment because the region lacks production fields.  However, if enough 
areas were found to be usable for native plant production, a large investment would have to be 
made in obtaining the proper equipment.

Current Native Plant Cooperatives and Groups 
As a result of the 2002 report to Congress entitled Interagency Program to Supply and 
Manage Native Plant Materials for Restoration and Rehabilitation on Federal Lands, and 
initiation of the National Native Plant Materials Development Program, many interagency 
programs have been established.  These programs focus on developing an increased supply of 
native plant materials to be used for restoration practices.  The Great Basin Restoration Initiative 
(GBRI) has perhaps been largest and most successful.  Within the Colorado Plateau region 
specifically the Uncompahgre Plateau Project (UP Project), the Colorado Plateau Native Plant 
Initiative (CPNPI), and the Northern Arizona Native Seed Alliance (NANSA) have each been 
created as an interagency effort. 
 
Great Basin Restoration Initiative 
The BLM GBRI works to provide technical assistance and obtain funding to support 
increased use of native plant materials for restoration of rangelands within Great Basin region 
(BLM, 27 April 2007, Briefing Statement) (Figure 4.1).  Although the GBRI is outside the study 
region, it serves as the best available model for initiation of a native plant materials market 
within the northern Arizona region.   
In 1999, GBRI helped to initiate the Great Basin Native Plant Selection and Increase 
Project, a multi-state, collaborative research project among the BLM GBRI and the USFS, 
Rocky Mountain Research Station which focuses on the evaluation, selection, and increase of 
native seed production within the Great Basin.  Main objectives of the project include: (1) 
increasing the availability of native plant materials to restore native plant communities of the 
Great Basin, (2) developing seeding technology and equipment to re-establish native plant 

60 
 
communities, (3) transfer of information and research results pertaining to native plant materials 
to seed growers and land managers. Major research involves the development of seed transfer 
guidelines, identification of propagation techniques, and examining interactions between 
invasive and native species (USFS, 2007).

Uncompahgre Plateau Project 
The UP Project was initially developed to address declining ecological health and winter 
habitat for deer and elk on the Uncompahgre Plateau.  It has since become a collaborative effort 
among state and federal agencies, utility companies, and a multitude of local citizens, 
governments and organizations within upper Colorado Plateau region with the main intention to 
expand their efforts throughout the entire Colorado Plateau region.  The Uncompahgre Plateau 

61 
 
Project aims to restore natural ecological functions on the Uncompahgre Plateau by 
incorporating research and outreach on fuels reduction, invasive species control, and native plant 
seeding and restoration (BLM, 9 September 2007, Uncompahgre Plateau Project; UP Project, 
2007).   
In 2002, the UP Project developed a Native Plant Program in order to provide genetically 
appropriate native plant materials to restore native plant communities within the upper Colorado 
Plateau region.  The primary focus of the program is to develop native seed through research and 
seed increaser fields and, ultimately, to provide source identification and data on cultivation to 
commercial seed producers.  The UP Project is currently working with 44 native species, with 25 
of those species in seed increaser fields (UP Project, 2007).  Continued research involves: 
cultivation, life history, seedbed ecology, competition and spacing studies, natural recruitment, 
field application techniques, and species adaptability of native species on the upper Colorado 
Plateau (UP Project, 16 April 2008, Executive Summary).  These studies have allowed the UP 
Project to make available seed stock of 15 species to commercial growers while providing them 
with necessary information on irrigation and spacing requirements, necessary soil amendments, 
and harvesting and cleaning techniques.  The UP Project also offers a buy back program as an 
incentive for growers to start producing these new species (UP Project, 2007). 
 
Northern Arizona Native Seed Alliance 
 
The NANSA is a working group which formed in March, 2007 to facilitate the 
development and production of native plant materials for the use in restoration, rehabilitation, 
and improvement projects throughout the northern Arizona region (Haskins, 2008).  An 
important aspect of NANSA involves information sharing among its members, which are 

62 
 
comprised of individuals, government agencies, non-profit organizations and commercial 
businesses from the region.  Collaboration on native plant research is also a main objective of the 
group.  Research interests of the group include investigating requirements and techniques for 
growing native plant materials, selecting genetically and ecologically appropriate species to be 
used in revegetation projects on the Colorado Plateau, and examining the economic feasibility of 
growing native plants in the northern Arizona region (Springer, 2007).   
 
Colorado Plateau Native Plant Initiative 
 
There is an increasing demand for site-adapted native plant materials for the Colorado 
Plateau region (Figure 4.2).  In recognition of these needs, representatives from USFS, BLM, 
NANSA, Northern Arizona University, state wildlife agencies, and the UP Project are working to 
form the Colorado Plateau Native Plant Initiative (CPNPI).  The CPNPI hopes to become an 
interagency, multi-regional native plant materials program.  The goals of CPNPI are similar to 
those of GBRI and the UP Project in that it will (1) develop an adequate supply of native plant 
materials, (2) develop proper restoration methodologies, and (3) engage in the sharing of 
information with public and private entities.  Through research and outreach CPNPI aims to 
successfully support restoration of native plant communities by establishing long-term strategies 
for the production of genetically appropriate native plant materials as well as creating outreach 
materials and scientific publications on the use of native plant materials for restoration (CPNPI, 
2007). 
The formation of these groups has been critical in developing an increased amount of 
materials needed to meet current restoration needs.  Specifically, the GBRI and the UP Project 
have provided a wealth of information which has assisted in the development of subsequent 

63 
 
groups.  Their efforts can thus be used as models when initiating a native plant materials market 
within the region.  The Northern Arizona Native Seed Alliance has just recently developed and 
much work is needed to reach its goals.  However, it has already be successful in collaborating 
with multiple federal, state, private, and non-profit entities which appears to be a critical 
component in initiating further development of native plant materials.

Survey Methods  
To assess the opportunity to initiate a native plant and seed industry within northern 
Arizona, surveys were developed for the supply and demand markets.  The overall purpose of the 
surveys was to assess current seeding practices and procedures and to identify and analyze 
current and future native plant material needs and concerns.  Through an extensive interview and 
searching process, participants were identified.   Preliminary information gained from interviews 
helped guide survey question development.  Pre-testing allowed for assessment of survey 
question comprehension, efficiency, relevancy and format organization.  From pre-testing 
feedback the final surveys were created and administered by a web-based approach.  The 
techniques used to develop and administer the survey proved to be effective and yielded high 
response rates.  The information gained highlights key elements that may be needed to stimulate 
a native plant market.   
 
Sample of Demand and Supply Survey Respondents 
A target group of potential survey participants was established for both supply and 
demand markets.  Demand survey participants included agencies and organizations within 
northern Arizona which were actively involved in restoration.  Supply survey participants 
included current production companies involved in the sale of native plant materials. 
Potential demand survey participants were identified by consulting agencies and 
organizations who were heavily involved in restoration projects within northern Arizona.  
Demand survey participants included personnel from federal, state, private and nonprofit entities 
that are currently or potentially involved in rehabilitation/restoration practices which use native 
plant materials within northern Arizona.   

65 
 
Due to the lack of native plant materials production suppliers within northern Arizona, 
potential supply survey participants included current plant material production companies 
throughout Arizona, nearby Western and Great Plains states, and those states which contained 
successful commercial seed production companies.  Native plant materials companies 
participating in the study were located in: Utah, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, California, 
Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Montana and 
Wyoming (Table 4.1).  These plant material production companies engage in both retail and/or 
wholesale native plant material sales.  In addition, individuals, identified through preliminary 
background interviews, who showed potential interest in initiating a native plant materials 
production company within northern Arizona, also were added to the supply group sample.

Question Development and Survey Construction 
To understand the context and design of a useful survey, a preliminary background 
investigation was conducted to determine current issues and trends pertaining to the use of native 
plant materials.  Interviews were conducted with natural resource managers from regional 
government agencies, private entities, and non-profit organizations, and private native plant 
landscaping and nursery owners within northern Arizona (Table 4.2).  The preliminary 
information was used to help guide in the development of relevant survey questions.  After the 
content of the surveys was determined, preliminary supply and demand surveys were created.

The research operations manager of Northern Arizona University’s Social Research 
Laboratory (SRL) was consulted for the survey’s design and content.  This guided the use of 
proper survey language and clear, unambiguous and concise wording to help eliminate question 
bias and survey fluency.  Survey questions were grouped into appropriate context categories.  In 
order to conduct the study, an Initial Application for Research along with the survey instrument 
was submitted to the Institutional Review Board at Northern Arizona University.  The 
application was approved in October 2007. 
Once question order, content, and format were finalized, a web-based survey was 
programmed for both the supply and demand markets using SurveyMonkey 

67 
 
(www.surveymonkey.com).  SurveyMonkey is an online survey tool which was selected for its 
ease of use and capability to create professional surveys.  
A web-based survey methodology was selected over traditional mail survey methods due 
to its capability for automatic verification and storage of survey responses using database 
technology as well as its ability to eliminate transcription errors (Andrews, Nonnecke, and 
Preece, 2003).  Data, exported into an Excel spreadsheet was checked to eliminate programming 
errors.  This method eliminated unanswered questions by use of special features and reduced 
administration time and cost.  Use of question “skip logic” enabled the respondent to be 
redirected to a relevant question within the survey based on the previous response.  To alleviate 
questions from being skipped entirely, all questions were programmed so the respondent could 
not continue without answering a question.   
 
Survey Content 
The demand survey consisted of 42 questions. The supply survey contained 37 questions 
(Appendix A).   The average length of time to complete the survey was approximately 15-20 
minutes.  Each survey began with an introduction page.  The purpose of an introduction page 
was to help establish a trusting relationship with the prospective respondent and encourage the 
respondent to complete the survey (Andrews, Nonnecke, and Preece, 2003).  The introduction of 
each survey included: (1) identification of the researcher, (2) explained the survey’s purpose, (3) 
explained how the results would be used, (4) guaranteed respondent confidentiality and 
anonymity and, and (5) explained the sampling methodology. 
Questions were organized according to topic relevance.  Demand survey topics included 
native plant material purchasing and expenditures, use and needs, issues and concerns, 

68 
 
equipment and operations, collaboration and funding, and policies and regulations.  Supply 
survey topics included native plant material sales, future demand, issues and concerns, 
equipment and operations, funding, and policies and regulations.  
To better understand details in these areas, both suppliers and purchasers were asked a 
series of specific questions regarding each topic.  Questions within each topic area were designed 
to gain insight on how a native plant market could be initiated within the region.  Specifically, 
expenditures or sales questions helped investigate native plant spending and sales trends.   
Questions regarding use and need were asked to gain information concerning quantities of native 
plant materials being used and the types of practices for which those materials were being used 
for.  By inquiring about future native plant materials demand, market trends could be assessed.  
Native plant material issues/concerns questions were designed to gain information concerning 
genetics, market limitations, ethical aspects of plant materials and seed costs.  Questions 
concerning equipment and operations helped to identify the available tools needed for 
development of a native plant materials market.  To help identify current and future funding 
options which would support a native plant market, questions about collaboration and funding 
were asked.  Lastly, policy and regulation questions were asked to gain information regarding 
current policy for rehabilitation/restoration work and purchasing requirements for native plant 
materials. 
 Each survey consisted of a variety of formats including close-ended, “select all that 
apply,” and open-ended questions.  Close-ended questions, where respondents selected an 
answer from a given list also included an “Other” category and, at times, a comment section.  
The “Other” category allowed the respondent to select an answer that was not on the 
predetermined list.  “Select all that apply” questions allowed for the survey participant to select 

69 
 
multiple answer choices.  Open-ended questions were included to encourage the survey 
participant to expand on issues not fully addressed in a closed-ended question format and 
enabled the responses to be assessed in a qualitative format. 
Participant memory recall is often limited when information being requested is too far in 
the past.  For this reason, questions were designed for the survey participant to recall information 
one year prior to the current year (2006).  For each question, a “Don’t Know” and “Decline to 
Answer” answer category was available to allow the respondent the choice not to answer a 
question.  Before exiting the survey, a short paragraph thanked survey respondents and an 
explanation of how the survey results would be used was explained.   
A large body of literature exists about the role incentives play, and their effect on survey 
response rates.  There is overwhelming agreement among social scientists that incentives 
increase overall response rates (Ryu et al., 2005).  For this reason, a copy of the final feasibility 
study report and a chance to win a Starbucks Coffee Company donation was offered as an 
incentive to each survey participant.  Starbucks Coffee Company generously donated $100 worth 
of Starbucks coffee and merchandise to be used as an incentive to complete the survey.  Each 
survey participant was entered into a drawing for a chance to win the prize.   
 
Survey Pre-testing 
 
A total of two pre-tests, one paper version and one web-based version were completed 
prior to the administration of the finalized web-based surveys.  Prior to the development of web-
based survey questions, draft paper-based survey questions were administered to the Northern 
Arizona Native Seed Alliance (NANSA) for feedback on survey content.  Revisions were made 
according to NANSA feedback and a web-based survey was created.  Fifteen professionals were 

70 
 
asked to complete the web-based supply and demand surveys as a pre-test.  This allowed for 
testing survey question comprehension, efficiency, relevancy and format organization.  Seven 
natural resource managers from the northern Arizona region and three NAU researchers familiar 
with native plant material practices were selected to pre-test the demand survey.  Three 
government agency personnel directly involved in purchasing or housing seed for restoration 
practices and two representatives from native plant material production companies located in 
Arizona were selected to pre-test the supply survey.  Of the 15 survey pre-test participants, three 
individuals were included in the final sample database as they were major entities in the demand 
for native plant materials.   
Prior to administering the web-based pre-test surveys, each potential survey pre-test 
recipient was contacted by telephone to explain the purpose of the survey and to gain consent to 
complete the survey.  It has been demonstrated that pre-notification contact has the strongest 
response rate impact (Kaplowitz et al., 2004).  Upon gaining approval to take the survey, the pre-
test group was sent a personalized email with instructions on how to complete the survey as well 
as the survey link.  A unique identifying number was assigned to each survey pre-test 
respondent.  This created a coded survey link which allowed survey responses to be associated 
with the respondents’ contact information.   
All survey pre-test respondents were given approximately two weeks to complete to the 
survey.  A follow-up email was sent one week into the survey response period to those 
respondents who had not yet submitted their survey.  Studies have shown that a follow-up email 
often has a positive effect on response rates (Andrews, Nonnecke, and Preece, 2003).  At the end 
of the two week survey response period, eight out of ten demand surveys were completed (80% 
response rate) and three out of five supply surveys were returned (60% response rate).  All 

71 
 
responses and feedback from the pre-test group were evaluated and surveys were amended to 
reflect relevant recommendations from this group.    
 
Survey Distribution 
The survey sample database files were finalized with a total of 42 demand and 39 supply 
contacts (Appendix B).  An attempt was made to contact each potential survey participant 
directly by telephone prior to sending the final survey link.  Pre-notification explained the 
purpose of the survey, how the results would be used, and to gain approval to participate.  Of the 
42 demand participants, 31 could be reached on the telephone and agreed to take the survey.  Of 
the 39 supply contacts, 27 could be reached directly on the telephone and agreed to participate in 
the study.  For the remaining 11demand participants and the 12 supply participants who could 
not be reached, messages were left on answering machines or with other associates.  All potential 
survey participants, including those not reached directly on the telephone, were sent their 
relevant surveys to allow for participation and increase response rates.  Survey links were 
embedded into personalized emails as well as instructions on how to successfully complete the 
survey, a deadline date, and an explanation of the Starbucks prize which was used as an incentive 
to complete the survey.  All survey participants were given approximately two weeks to respond 
to the survey.  A unique identifying number was assigned to each survey participant.  This 
identifying number allowed survey responses to be associated with the respondents’ contact 
information.  Additionally, the identifying number allowed for follow-up of ambiguous answers.   
Consequently, survey responses remained confidential and anonymous and were reported as an 
aggregate.   

72 
 
A reminder email with each coded survey link and a deadline date reminder was sent one 
week into the survey response period to those respondents who had not yet completed the survey.  
At the end of the first survey response period, 29 returned a complete demand survey (69% 
response rate) and 25 completed the supply survey (64% response rate).   
Participants who had not yet responded to the surveys after the two week response period 
were contacted again.  A total of 13 demand and 14 supply contacts were called directly by 
telephone.  The survey administration method previously used was followed again.  At the end of 
the second week response period the demand survey gained eight additional completed surveys 
and increased the response rate to 88% (37 responses total).  The supply survey gained four 
respondents, increasing the response rate to 85% (33 responses total).  Contact by telephone prior 
to sending the surveys, personalized emails, follow-up contact, and an incentive led to a high 
response rate.  Applying these tactics increase response rates, augments the validity and 
reliability of the survey data, and the resulting research conclusions. 
 
Analysis of Survey Results 
Final response datasets for each survey were downloaded from the SurveyMonkey 
website in Excel then formatted and imported into Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 
(SPSS) software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).  The SPSS combined results for surveys in each 
dataset.  Numeric values were coded to reflect actual answer choices.  Survey questions were 
analyzed by calculating answer frequencies (n) and valid percents of respondent participation for 
each question.  For respondents answering “Don’t Know” and “Decline to Answer,” those 
responses were counted as missing and were not included in the valid percent calculations.  For 
multiple choice questions stating “Select all that apply,” total percent may exceed 100, as 

73 
 
respondents could answer multiple times.  Valid percents, in these cases, were calculated by 
dividing the total response for each category by the total number of responses for that question.  
Percents were rounded which may cause total percents to be slightly greater or less than 100. 
Answers within a “comment” or “other” response were tabulated and analyzed.  
Responses fitting into the original question categories were recoded accordingly and included in 
final valid percent and frequency results.  For ease of the analysis, open-ended and other 
responses were summarized.  For question where open and other responses that were repetitive 
are listed below the corresponding question and delineated with the number of duplicate 
responses in parenthesis.  Questions and corresponding results are discussed in the survey results 
section and summarized in an Annotated Questionnaire format (Appendix C). 
 
Demand Survey Results  
Native plant material purchasing and expenditures 
 
When respondents were asked to provide the amount of seed (in pounds) purchased for 
seeding practices in the last year, over half of respondents answered equally between 0-100 
pounds and 101-500 pounds of seed purchased (26% each).   
Overall, when respondents were asked to specify the amount of native seed purchased (in 
pounds) and in the last year related to ecological restoration, burn area rehabilitation, roadside 
mitigation, flood abatement, wildlife habitat improvement, and range rehabilitation most 
respondents purchased native seed for burn area rehabilitation and ecological restoration 
activities (Figure 4.3).  Almost two-thirds (61%) of all the native seed purchased (in pounds) 
during 2006 was for burn area rehabilitation activities.   
 
 

74 
 
 
Figure 4.3: Seed purchased (in pounds) in 2006 for ecological restoration and burn area 
rehabilitation 
 
For ecological restoration, over half (54%) of respondents answered either 0-100 pounds 
(27%) or 101-500 pounds (27%) of native seed was purchased.  An equal amount of respondents 
(30% each) said between 101-500 pounds and 1,001-5,000 pounds was purchased for burn area 
rehabilitation.  For roadside mitigation, a little over two-thirds (67%) said they purchased 0-100 
pounds, and 50% said they purchased 101-500 pounds for wildlife habitat improvement.  Buyers 
of native seed did not purchase seed for flood abatement or range rehabilitation practices (Figure 
4.4).   
In the next five years considering that agency/organization programs grew at an optimal 
rate, almost one-quarter (23%) of respondents stated that 0-100 pounds of native seed would be 
necessary for their programs needs.  “Other” responses noted that the amount of native seed 
needed was highly dependent upon future fire size and fire frequency. 
When respondents were asked about the amount of money spent on native seed in 2006, a 
little over one-quarter (26%) of respondents stated their agency/organization spent between

$1,000-$5,000 on native seed in the last year, while 21% each spent $10,001-$50,000 or over 
$100,000.  When estimates were categorized according to agency, the BLM spent to greatest 
amount money on native plant materials in 2006 ($270,000) (Figure 4.5).

Of the amount of money spent on native seed in 2006, a little over half (54%) of 
respondents said they spent $0-$5,000 (27% stated $0-$100 and 27% stated $1,001-$5,000) on 
native seed for ecological restoration.  For burn area rehabilitation, almost one-third (30%) of 
respondents said they spent $0-$1,000 on native seed.  About two-thirds (67%) of respondents 
said they spent $1,001-$5,000 dollars on native seed for roadside mitigation, and the same 
percentage (67%) of the respondents said they spent $0-$1,000 on native seed for wildlife habitat 
improvement. Again buyers of native seed did not purchase seed for flood abatement or range 
rehabilitation practices (Figure 4.6).

Since buyers of native seed did not purchase seed for flood abatement or range 
rehabilitation practices, there was no money spent on native seed in these areas.  As with the 
amount in pounds, most respondents spent more money on native seed in 2006 for ecological 
restoration and burn area rehabilitation activities (Figure 4.7).   

77 
 
 
 
Figure 4.7: Dollars spent on native seed in 2006 for ecological restoration and burn area

Survey respondents disclosed that a little over two-fifths (42%) of the overall money 
spent on native seed in 2006 was for burn area rehabilitation practices.  Overall in 2006, 
respondents indicated they purchased higher quantities (in pounds) and spent more money on 
native seed for burn area rehabilitation than what was purchased and spent for ecological 
restoration (Figure 4.8).

When respondents were asked where most of their native seed supply was purchased 
from in the last year, almost half (44%) claimed that their native seed supply came from out-of-
state sources but within a defined ecological region containing geographically distinct 
assemblages of natural communities and species (e.g. Great Basin, Colorado Plateau, etc.)

Many respondents (40%) identified their native seed supply was acquired through a 
request for bid procedure.  While most of the native seed acquired was obtained from Granite 
Seed Company in Lehi, Utah and some of the seed obtained was collected either on-site or 
through wildland collections.  
 
Native plant material use and needs 
A series of questions were asked to assess whether or not regional organizations/agencies 
currently implemented seeding and if so how much native plant materials were being used in 
relation to specified land management practices.  In addition, these questions aimed to identify 

79 
 
factors affecting whether to purchase of native plant materials and future needs of specific 
species to be used in restoration.  
The majority of respondents (82%) currently implemented seeding.  Of those respondents 
currently involved within seeding, a little over one-quarter (26%) said they primarily implement 
seeding for ecological restoration.  Wildlife habitat improvement and burn area rehabilitation 
came in a close second for the purpose of implementing seeding (22% each).  Respondents 
answering with “Other” said they implemented seeding after timber operations, construction 
activities, and for cattle forage (Figure 4.10).

When deciding which native plant materials were needed for large-scale seeding, the 
probability of success of native plant materials was identified as the most important factor to 
organizations/agencies (34%).  In addition, maintaining plant species diversity and meeting 
wildlife forage/habitat objectives were also important factors buyers of native plant materials

A group of four questions was designed to identify which native plant species 
organizations/agencies would like to have brought into local commercial production for use in 
large-scale seeding projects within the next five years.  Of the top ten choices for native seed, 
respondents identified blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) as their number one choice (see Appendix 
D for a full list of scientific names and authorities).  Among all the responses (n=149), the five 
most frequently demanded species for seeds (23% of the total responses) in order of popularity 
included:  blue grama, Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica), squirreltail (Elymus elymoides), 
fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), and muttongrass (Poa fendleriana) (Figure 4.11).

Native plant material issues/concerns 
A single question was asked to determine land managers’ perception of the term “local 
genotype.”   Follow-up questions aimed to discover the most salient issues related native plant 
materials use and limiting factors to obtaining seed locally.   
Although over one-quarter (29%) of respondents defined local genotype as a native plant 
coming from a local source (within a 50 mile radius), some respondents answering “Other” 
expressed that northern Arizona’s extreme elevation and climatic conditions make it difficult to 

83 
 
specify an exact definition of local genotype and that the definition is also highly dependent on 
the species in question. 
An overwhelming majority (93%) of respondents said that their organization or agency 
was concerned about the genetic source of native seed.  Furthermore, most respondents (59%) 
choose not to use non-native plant materials for seeding practices.   However, respondents agreed 
that the primary limiting factor keeping their organization/agency from buying seed locally was 
the lack of availability (50%).   
The majority of respondents (87%) foresaw a need for local genotype native plant 
materials for seeding practices within the next five years.  Moreover, respondents revealed that 
availability of seed (27%) and cost of seed (22%) were the greatest obstacles to overcome in 
order to initiate a successful native plant materials market within northern Arizona (Figure 4.14).

Native plant equipment and operations 
 
To assess availability and need for native plant materials production equipment and 
facilities, respondents were first asked if they collected native seed for seeding projects. There 
was no notable difference in the number of respondents stating that they do collect (53%) and 
those stating that they do not collect native seed (47%).  Of the organizations/agencies that 
collected native seed, one-third (33%) collected less than ten pounds within the last year while 
28% collected 10-50 pounds.   
When respondents were asked what mechanisms or facilities they have to collect, store, 
and/or propagate native plant seed, over one-quarter (27%) said that they had no such 
mechanisms or facilities to process native seed while 18% said they have storage facilities. 
 
Collaboration and funding 
Collaboration occurred most often between federal (22%) and state agencies (20%). Most 
respondents stated they would like to work with federal and state agencies (17% each) in the 
future on native plant projects. Over one-half (57%) of respondents said they currently receive 
federal or state monies or incentives to assist with seeding practices with a little over half (52%) 
receiving funding from federal dollars, excluding federal incentive programs.  
When respondents were asked what programs were available to their organization/agency 
that encourage increases in local native seed production, over one-quarter (28%) of respondents 
stated that  restoration programs were the most available to their organization/agency.  
Respondent answers varied widely when asked to list three native plant programs (first to third 
choice) that would be the most useful to their organization or agency.  Most responses shared a 

85 
 
common theme that revealed any program leading to an adequate production of local native seed 
would be important. 
 
Native plant policy and regulation 
 
Of the federal, state, private, tribal and nonprofit entities to which this survey was 
administered, most respondents fell within the “federal” or “state” categories (47% and 27% 
respectively).  One-quarter (25%) of respondents said that organization/agency policy was the 
main deciding factor in purchasing native seeds while a little less than one-quarter (21%) thought 
availability of native seed was also important.  Project acreage appeared to the most important 
deciding factor when determining how much native seed is purchased. 
The majority (80%) of respondents said their organization or agency currently required 
the use of certified noxious weed-free native seed.  For those respondents who did not currently 
require the use of certified seed, 67% said they anticipate requirements to use certified seed 
within the next five years.   
Most respondents (80%) were not willing to enter into a five year contract with a certified 
native seed company.  Open-ended comments to this question disclosed a variety of factors that 
need to be considered.  Additionally, most respondents (74%) were not interested in becoming a 
supplier of native seed.  This is logical since respondents for this survey are buyers of native 
seed. 
 
Supply Survey Results  
Native plant material sales  
Most supply survey respondents (70%) stated they were currently involved in a business 
of selling native plant materials.  Respondents not currently involved in selling native plant 

86 
 
materials indicated they were a government agency, and policy does not allow them to sell native 
plant materials, or they had no interest.  
Of the types of native plant materials sold (trees, shrubs, grasses, forbs, or seeds), almost 
one-third (32%) of respondents stated that their business was involved with the sale of native 
seed (Figure 4.15).

Annotated Questionnaire – Supply Survey (Appendix C) for a list of “Other” responses. 
 
 
The majority of respondents (97%) were currently in the business of selling native seed. 
Federal agencies and private local organizations were identified as the entities buying the bulk of 
their native plant materials (24% each) while state agencies were not far behind (22%).   
Of the 87% of respondents stating they were knowledgeable with the revenue accrued by 
selling their native plant materials, over one-third (35%) stated that most of their revenue was 
accrued by selling strictly native seed.   
When respondents were asked to identify the top five types of native plant species for 
which the majority of their seeds sales came from in 2006, various species of wheatgrass 

87 
 
(Agropyron spp.) were the most commonly sold.  Respondent answers varied widely in species 
selection within all first through fifth choices.  Overall, various species of wheatgrass and 
needlegrass (Achnatherum spp.) were the most commonly sold. 
 
Future native plant demand 
Four questions were asked in order to identify which native plant species the respondents 
would predict to be the highest in demand for large-scale seeding projects within the next five 
years.  Of the eleven species listed within all first choice responses, seed of grass species 
appeared to be in highest demand (91%).  Bluebunch grass (Pseudoroegneria spicata) and Indian 
ricegrass (Achnatherum hymenoides) had the highest answer frequency among all first through 
fifth choice responses (18% of the total responses).  Among all the responses (n=53), the five 
most frequently stated species for seeds thought to be in highest demand, in order of popularity 
included: bluebunch wheatgrass, indian ricegrass, western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii), 
thickspike wheatgrass (Elymus lanceolatus), squirreltail (Figure 4.16).

Considering the first choice responses for grasses, many respondents identified various 
species of wheatgrass buyers would demand.  Among all first through fifth choice responses, 
western wheatgrass and bluebunch wheatgrass were the most common for grass species, with 
western wheatgrass having the highest answer frequency (10% of the total responses n=48).   
Looking at respondent’s ranking of the top five forbs in future demand, the majority 
identified blue flax (Linum perenne) as the primary species of all first choice responses.   Blue 
flax also had the highest answer frequency of the total responses (19%).   Blue flax, yarrow 
(Achillea spp.), and globemallow were the most common among all the responses for forb 
species (n=32).   
Suppliers identified sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) and fourwing saltbush as the top 
tree/shrub species to purchase, with fourwing saltbush having the highest answer frequency 
(17% of all the answer responses).  Among all responses (n=41) sagebrush, fourwing saltbush 
and bitterbrush (Purshia spp.) were thought to be the most popular. 
 
Native plant material issues/concerns 
Although almost one-third (32%) stated local genotype can be defined as native plant 
materials coming from a local source (within a 50 mile radius), respondents answering “Other” 
expressed that a definition of local genotype is highly dependent upon topography of a specific 
region, climatic conditions, habitat, and the species being considered.  
In subsequent questions, respondents identified that producing and/or using local 
genotype native plant materials was “somewhat” (47%) to “very important” (33%).  Further 
comments revealed that producing local genotype plant materials is difficult due to the costs and 
the limited resources that are available during the collection process.  In addition, suppliers are 

89 
 
more interested in producing what is currently in demand.  Despite the limited production of 
local genotype native plant materials, the majority of respondents (70%) agreed that there is a 
current market for selling local genotype native plant material for large-scale restoration projects. 
Most respondents stated that lack of a consistent and reliable demand (38%) and lack of 
knowledge about native plant material production (21%) were the most significant limitations to 
a business involved in the production of native plant materials (Figure 4.17).

Native plant equipment and operations 
Several questions were asked to identify what facilities/machines organization/agency 
currently had to support the production of native plant materials.  About one-fifth (21%) said 
they have seed storage facilities followed by a relatively even distribution of respondents stating 
that land, seed cleaning machines, seed collection tools, and labor was also available for native 
plant production (16-19% range).   

90 
 
Almost two-fifths (39%) of respondents said over 100 acres was currently used for native 
plant materials production.  Thirty-one percent of respondents indicated that they obtain the 
native plant materials they propagate for sale through the field collection.  Similarly, 30% 
indicated they acquire their native plant material from local sources within their state (Figure

Of the 82% of respondents that specifically collect native seeds, most (61%) stated that 
those seeds were wildland collected.  Almost half (47%) of respondents said their seeds were 
most often hand-picked versus other collection methods.  For respondents involved in the 
collection of native seed, 65% revealed some of their collection responsibilities were 
subcontracted out.  
Several questions were asked about native seed production costs as they related to 
collection, propagation, storage, and labor.  Responses indicated that production costs were 
highest for seed collection activities and labor (Figure 4.19).

V. Discussion  
This was an exploratory study, and native plant materials market surveys were conducted 
to assist in providing baseline information needed to further evaluate native plant market 
opportunities in northern Arizona.  The information gained will help guide subsequent research 
questions and development of future studies.  However, there were several limitations to the 
surveys.   Most notably is the small sample size (demand survey n=42, supply survey n=39).  A 
sample size of 42 and 39 renders a margin of error of 15.4% (1/√42) and 16.0% (1/√39) 
respectively.  Most social researchers look to have a margin of error of ≤ 5%, which means a 
sample group of ± 500 would be needed to yield information in which more accurate 
assumptions could be made about an entire population (Niles, 2006).  Furthermore, the sampling 
methodology used consisted of two types of non-probability sampling techniques: (1) purposive 
sampling (sampling specific groups or types of people based on the purpose of the study) and (2) 
snowball sampling (existing study subjects recruit future subjects from among their 
acquaintances) (Babbie, 2004).  Both of these sampling methods do not allow for an equal 
chance of all buyers and suppliers in northern Arizona to be selected.  Therefore, this 
methodology does not lend itself to statistical analysis and the ability to generalize the findings 
to a larger population.  Therefore, conclusions should be considered cautiously. Second, due to 
the lack of suppliers within the region of study, surveys were administered to suppliers outside 
the region.  These businesses often supply native plant materials to buyers within ecosystems 
very different from northern Arizona.  Information obtained from outside suppliers was at times 
not relevant to the issue the question was designed to answer.  For example, questions designed 
to identify the most important species to have brought into production provided an abundance of 
species which are not used within the region and assumptions regarding needed native plant 

94 
 
species could not be made.  Moreover, sizes of the seed companies surveyed varied and answers 
given showed a clear distinction between producer sizes and, at times, made overall assumptions 
difficult to make.  Therefore, conducting the survey among similarly sized seed companies 
would help to obtain more congruent data.  Thirdly, question design is responsible for some un-
interpretable data.  At times, answers disclosed that questions were unclear and may have been 
misunderstood.  Several respondents also indicated that because of the complexity of the several 
questions, time and or memory recall made it difficult for them to give precise answers.  This 
may be improved by simplifying questions.  For example, a question within the demand survey 
asked respondents to list their top ten choices of seed.  Questions like these are time consuming 
and may deter respondents from continuing with the survey.  Pre-testing is a good way of testing 
survey question comprehension, efficiency and completing multiple pre-testing sessions could 
help produce more concise questions.  Lastly, choice of the survey instrument delivery mode was 
an important factor in gaining the highest quality of data possible.  Although web-based survey 
instrument has many positive impacts on response rates and analysis of the information gained, 
at times it made clarification of questions impossible and therefore a telephone survey may 
improve the quality of information gained by providing immediate clarity of questions and more 
control of answer responses.   
Despite these limitations, these surveys make several important contributions to the 
study.  First, the surveys successfully identified several important factors to consider when 
initiating a native plant materials market in northern Arizona.  Second, vital insight on the 
disconnect between both the demand and supply markets was provided.  With the information 
and insight gained, useful recommendations on how to proceed with initiation of the market can 
be made.  Third, the need to further investigate native plant market opportunities in the northern 

95 
 
Arizona region is apparent.  Subsequent research will benefit from the exploratory nature of this 
project and the baseline information obtained with survey limitations clearly identified. 
The demand and supply surveys identified many limiting factors to consider when 
initiating a successful native plant materials market in northern Arizona.  From a demand 
perspective, lack of availability and cost has kept purchases of native seed minimal even though 
there has been increased policy favoring their use.  Coupled with this, it appears that within the 
current market there is a variable demand for native plant materials due to unpredictable fire size 
and frequency and policy decisions continued use of non-native plant materials.   On the supply 
side, an inconsistent and unreliable demand has made suppliers hesitant in further development 
of native plant materials for this particular market.  In addition, an abundance of information is 
available for successful native plant production, however; this information is not adequately 
disseminated and, subsequently, many suppliers still lack the required knowledge to successfully 
produce native plant materials.   Many of these factors need to be overcome for successful 
initiation of a localized native plant materials market.    
The majority of native seed purchased (in pounds) and money spent on native seed in 
2006 was for ecological restoration and burn area rehabilitation.  Overall, in 2006, burn area 
rehabilitation programs purchased more seed and allocated the most funds then any other 
restoration/rehabilitation activities.  The BLM, which manages more land (264 million surface 
acres) (Davis, 2001) than any other federal agency, spent more on native plant materials in 2006 
than any other agency surveyed (USFS, NPS, ADOT, NRCS, and AZGFD).    
Burn area rehabilitation seems to play a large role in the demand for native plant 
materials. Each year, millions of dollars are spent on post-fire emergency rehabilitation 
treatments (Robichaud et al., 2000) for the main purpose of erosion control and watershed 

96 
 
protection.  Seeding is the most common treatment used for post-fire rehabilitation and soil 
stabilization (Beyers, 2004) and, although in recent years the trend has been towards an increased 
use of native species, the lack and cost of these materials have allowed for the continues use of 
non-native species.  Over the last 30 years, specifically within Arizona and New Mexico, the 
number of acres burned by wildfire in the Southwest and the amount of money allocated for 
post-fire seeding in those areas has increased dramatically (Figure 5.1).

Within fire-prone ecosystems where understory vegetation carry frequent low intensity 
ground fires, most native species are adapted to reproducing rapidly after a fire event (Keeley et 
al., 2006).   However, research applying predictions from Global Circulation Models (GCMs) 
consistently suggests that with climate change the western United States will continue to 
experience increases in fire frequency and severity as a direct result of increased temperatures 
and drought conditions (Nitschke and Innes, 2006; Flannigan et al., 2005).   Increases in fire 
frequency and severity have shown to be important in controlling post-fire ecosystem structure 
and function.   A changing fire regime may cause an overall loss of nutrients in the ecosystem 
resulting in increased plant mortality and invasion of non-native species (Turner and Romme, 
1994; Thonicke et al., 2004; Schoennagel et al., 2004; Wang and Kemball, 2005; Freeman et al., 
2007).  These changes will ultimately affect the ability for post-fire native plant community 
reestablishment.  Therefore, the potential for changes in fire frequency and severity underscores 
the importance of protecting native plant communities from predicted changes in their abundance 
and function.    
Research have shown that pre-wildfire vegetation treatments, such as tree thinning, 
prescribed burning, mechanical fuel treatments, native plant seeding, and other treatments could 
be used to reduce negative effects of ecological changes on native plant communities by 
increasing native species structure and function, diversity, and biomass productivity (Menke, 
1992; Brockway and Lewis, 1997; Covington et al. 2001).  Nonetheless, with an increase in fire 
frequency and severity, the need for emergency post-fire rehabilitation efforts specifically that of 
post-fire seeding will persist.  Thus, the future market of native plant materials may be driven by 
an increased demand for post-fire seeding materials.  However, care should be taken to ensure 
seed used for post-fire seeding is not contaminated with non-native species since these species 

98 
 
have the ability to further disrupt essential ecosystem processes.   More importantly, the use of 
local genotype plant material will be valuable in returning proper ecosystem function to post-fire 
environments and increasing their ability to be more resiliant and adaptable to a changing 
environment (Huenneke, 1991).   
Based on the results of both the demand and supply surveys, consensus in both groups 
revealed that defining “local genotype” is difficult because of elevation, climatic conditions and 
consideration of the species in question, although, both sides tend to agree that defining the term 
“local genotype” is seed from a local source (within a 50 mile radius).   Both seed companies and 
land managers conveyed they are concerned with the genetic source of seed.   However, 
according to survey results, the majority of the seed supply purchased in 2006 came from out-of-
state sources but within a defined ecological region containing geographically distinct 
assemblages of natural communities and species (e.g. Great Basin, Colorado Plateau, etc.), and 
although most organizations/agencies stated they prefer not seeding or planting non-native plant 
materials, a rather high percentage said they still use non-native plant materials.  The lack of an 
adequate supply of local genotype materials and high costs associated with those materials 
appear to have a substantial influence on decisions whether to purchase native plant materials 
and where those materials are obtained from.   
Policy often drives decisions on whether to purchase native seeds.  Currently, most 
agencies have policies requiring the use of native seeds, although, lack of native seed availability 
has annulled these policies, and use of non-native species continues.  Most organizations / 
agencies surveyed require the use of certified seed or anticipate doing so in the near future.  
Today, a large amount of the seeds used in revegetation activities are certified (Kujawski and 
Ogle, 2005).    The process of seed certification is intended to verify source of the seed, help 

99 
 
preserve genetic purity and identity, and decrease the likelihood that seed mixes on the market 
are contaminated with noxious weed species.    Additionally, the Arizona Crop Improvement 
Association mandates that all certified Variety/Cultivar seeds be tested to verify seed 
germination and purity.  Therefore, certified seeds are usually of higher quality and purity and 
have greater germination potential (Dunne, 2002).  Many federal and state revegetation policies 
now incorporate the use of genetically appropriate native plant materials, and new alternative 
Pre-Variety Germplasm seed certification methods have become essential to the procurement, 
production, and distribution of these materials (AOSCA, Native Plant Connection Bulletin).  Pre-
Variety Germplasm seed certification acts to assure genetic integrity of native seeds on the 
market, and is an important tool used to preserve native plant populations and ensure success to 
revegetation projects.    
 According to survey results, due to current policy shifts requiring the use of certified 
native plant materials most commercial native seed producers are able to provide certified seed 
and have begun to do so because of state regulations or their own ecological ethics.  The survey 
did not specifically inquire about whether native seed producers are able to charge a premium for 
the certified materials they provide.  However, due to extra cost involved in the certification 
process, prices for certified native plant materials often reflect the company’s investment to do 
so.   
The native seed industry has begun to play a larger role in producing genetically 
appropriate materials.  However, limitations associated with producing those materials makes 
increased production difficult.  Many suppliers stressed that producing these materials is not 
always practical because of the limited ecosystem ranges these materials are adapted to, cost of 
collection, and low probability of selling those materials.  Despite these limiting variables, the 

100 
 
majority (70%) of suppliers believe there is a current market to sell local genotype plant material.  
However, demand for these materials dictates their availability and most suppliers are more 
interested in producing and selling native plant materials which are currently highest in demand.   
Most companies surveyed were outside the northern Arizona region; therefore species in demand 
within their region may be well outside the northern Arizona region.   
A future need for a supply of local genotype plant materials is evident and, in order to 
initiate a successful native plant materials market within the region, constraints of availability 
and cost of native seed need to be overcome.   Without locally-adapted native plant materials, 
high prices will persist and purchasing of materials from non-local sources will continue.  An 
increase in demand for local genotype materials may stimulate local market opportunities and 
therefore an increase in the supply of genetically preferred species.  Costs for local genotype 
plant materials may be lowered if an abundant supply is produced and if increased demand is 
perceived.  Moreover, producers and organizations/agencies should come to a consensus on the 
scale “local genotype” is defined.  Therefore, an increase of locally-adapted plant materials can 
be developed accordingly.   
Both surveys helped to identify the most important species each side would like to have 
brought into production.  Most suppliers and buyers predicted that seeds of grass will be in 
highest demand in the next five years.  Species of native grass have been on the market 
regionally outside of Arizona for some time.  It has been noted that grass species are the highest 
in demand because of their broad range of adaptability (Steve Monsen, Retired USDA Forest 
Service, pers comm.).  Furthermore, the majority of native plant production research has gone 
into the development of grass species.  From this, an abundance of knowledge and equipment for 

101 
 
their development exists.  However, survey results indicated inconsistency when trying to 
identify exactly which species of grass will be needed.   
The species of grass, forbs, and trees/shrubs identified as highest in demand for buyers, in 
order of frequency selection were blue grama, penstemon and globemallow, and fourwing 
saltbush.  Additionally, land managers conveyed interest in purchasing ecosystem specific seed 
mixes.  Meanwhile, in comparing the native plant species suppliers predict as highest in demand 
results were somewhat misleading.  As stated previously, suppliers surveyed were outside of 
northern Arizona and, due to the ecosystem differences; their market may have different 
demands.    For example, suppliers predicted various species of wheatgrass as highest in demand, 
although some species of wheatgrass, in particular crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum) and 
intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium), are considered to be non-native perennial 
species (Richards et al., 1998; Springer et al., 2001; Beyers, 2004) within northern Arizona.  
These species would be considered undesirable for restoration projects within the region because 
of their ability to outcompete locally-adapted species for resources leading to decreased native 
plant propagation and diversity (Blair, 2001).  Species considered for forbs and trees/shrubs were 
a closer match on the supply and demand sides.  In order of frequency selection, blue flax, 
globemallow, and yarrow were selected for forbs, while sagebrush and fourwing saltbush were 
identified for tree/shrub species in highest future demand.   The supply/demand link with forbs 
and trees/shrubs may be due to these species tendency to a broader native range as compared to 
grasses causing demand for these species to be similar across a broader range of markets. 
Buyers within regions where commercial seed companies are prevalent increase the 
demand for species which are desired in their region. Therefore, the supply of non-local and 
sometimes undesirable species will continue to increase.  Many of the desirable grass species

appear to already be available through commercial seed producers outside the region.  Therefore, 
producing a large enough supply of these species locally and providing them at a competitive 
rate may be difficult.   This pressure could be alleviated by focusing on producing native species 
which are needed but that lack a multi-regional demand.  
The native seed industry is highly competitive, and variable seed prices are driven by 
imbalances between supply and demand and cost associated with species production.  The 
average price for native seed is most often higher than non-native seed.  Native species pose 
extra processing difficulties due seed shattering and seed dormancy issues.  For those species 
which are perhaps difficult to produce or for which demand is low the price per pound of seed is 
much higher than for those which are produced in large quantities.  For example of the 13 
species buyers identified as the top seed, grasses, forbs, trees/shrubs (Appendix C) the cost per 
pound of muttongrass is exceptionally high, whereas the cost of blue grama fairly low (Table 
5.1).  The high cost for muttongrass may reflect difficulties of production or low demand.   
Alternative Pre-Variety Germplasm certification methods help to facilitate procurement, 
production, and distribution of native plant materials and increase the quality of native seed and 
should lead to an increase in demand.  As demand increases, more seed is produced, which 
enables the cost per pound of seed to steadily decrease.   
Resources available for seed production also aid in determining current market prices.  In 
terms of production, supply survey results showed agreement that seed storage facilities, land, 
seed cleaning machines, seed collection tools and labor are necessary in order to supply a reliable 
amount of native plant materials to meet the current demand within the region.  The 
machines/facilities recommended for each step of native plant production process varied but, all 
are readily available through various agriculture equipment companies (Table 5.2)

Furthermore, supply survey results revealed that the number of acres identified as most 
often used for native plant materials production was over 100 acres, although field collection of 
seed plays an important role in the production of native plant materials and this most often takes 
place in wildland settings.  Wildland collecting could reduce the number of acres needed for seed 
production and is the most feasible option when obtaining specific species which would be too 
costly to produce in production fields.  However, seeds collected in this fashion are mostly 

104 
 
gathered by hand-picking and the overall supply from wildland sources may be much less than 
the demand.

The survey revealed that collection of native seed within organizations/agencies occurs, 
however, many organizations/agencies lack proper equipment or facilities to collect and process 
seed efficiently so their efforts have yielded relatively small outputs.  Furthermore, many 
organizations/agencies involved in small-scale seed collection often depend on voluntary labor 

105 
 
with collection efforts led by people who have limited experience in seed collection.  As a result, 
the amount of viable seeds obtained is minimal.  Several agencies are able to take advantage of 
NRCS Plant Materials Centers (PMCs) abilities to process seed, labor, space, and time is often 
minimal.  However, based on the amount of seed needed, seed collection and/or NRCS PMCs 
may not be feasible and quantities produced may not be sufficient for restoration/rehabilitation 
activities within the region.   
A handful of facilities and tools are available and used to collect, store and/or propagate 
native plant materials within the northern Arizona region which are spread between federal, 
state, and non-profit entities (Table 5.3).  However, although an abundance of seed production 
equipment exists for purchase, seed collection equipment and seed processing equipment are 
limited among all agencies and purchasing these tools would be beneficial in order to begin 
developing a more adequate supply of locally-adapted native plant materials.   
Costs associated with native plant materials production and land needed for production 
appears to be high.  In 2007, the Uncompahgre Plateau Project (UP Project) investigated the cost 
and time associated with development of native plant species for release as cultivars.  Based on  
annual operating costs for the UP Project and the Great Basin Restoration Initiative (GBRI), the 
estimated cost per species for collection, research, increase and release is approximately 
$15,000-25,000 per year and the average timeframe for the development of a species ranges from 
4-12 years (CPNPI, 2007).   An interview with Granite Seed Company revealed that more than 
10,000 acres is needed to supply large-scale restoration projects with the materials needed 
annually (Don Bermant, Granite Seed Company, Personal Communication).  The survey 
revealed that most commercial seed companies expend the most money on seed collection and 
labor.

The survey also showed that the majority of commercial seed companies in the West are 
private growers who receive no external funding.   Private growers often have no restrictions on 
who is able to purchase the native plant materials produced, but obtaining proper funding may be 
difficult for private growers.  Alternatively, state and federal entities often receive funding and 
have equipment available, but, policies on the sale of seeds prohibit seed to be sold for profit.    

107 
 
There are a limited number of native seed suppliers within northern Arizona.  Thus, 
identifying potential suppliers is critical for market initiation.  From the demand survey results, 
five local entities expressed an interest in becoming a supplier of native seed.  It should be noted 
that survey respondent input was not obtained from individuals outside the targeted sample 
group (n=42).  Thus, the number of individuals interested in becoming a supplier of native seed 
is not exhaustive and may be higher than what the survey results indicate.   Nevertheless, two-
fifths of the respondents currently have seed storage capabilities while only one-fifth stated that 
greenhouses, seed collection machines, and irrigation were available.  All five potential local 
suppliers indicated the lack of funding, time, and labor are major obstacles in supplying native 
seed.   Without the proper amount of skilled labor, sufficient funding, and necessary equipment, 
obtaining and processing large quantities of native seed is not feasible.   Partnerships between 
private growers and government agencies may prove to be beneficial in improving funding for 
native plant production and equipment sources.  For example, the GBRI and the UP Project has 
created successful partnerships with private growers.  These partnerships have enabled GBRI 
and the UP Project to develop an increased amount of native plant materials needed to meet 
current demands. 
As a part of the BLM’s GBRI the Great Basin Native Plant Selection and Increase Project 
(GBNPSIP) has worked with private growers over the course of many years to help increase 
native plant materials.  GBNPSIP acquires funding through an Interagency Agreement between 
the USDA Forest Services’ Rocky Mountain Research Station, Shrub Sciences Laboratory in 
Provo, Utah and the BLM.  Total funding for the project was approximately between $4.5 
million to $6 million from 2001 to 2006 (GBRI, 200; Pellant, 2006) with their first year of 
funding totaling $800,000.  The Uncompahgre Plateau Projects’ Native Plant Program, which 

108 
 
was modeled after GBRI, has received direct and in-kind funding from the BLM, USFS, 
Colorado Division of Wildlife (CDOW), Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, NRCS, National 
Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF), Western SARE, and the Colorado Mule Deer 
Foundation.  From 2002 through December 2007 the program has received approximately 
$2,437,000 million in funding, with the majority of total funding coming from the BLM (50%) 
and the USFS (35%).  During the initial stages of UP Project funding equaled approximately 
$500,000 per year.  However, funding has decreased every year and the Project now operates on 
about $350,000 per year.  This amount pays for one year-round full time employee, four full time 
seasonal, two lease pickup trucks, gas, equipment, overhead for UP staff, and cooperating 
facilities (Pam Motley, UP Project, Personal Communication).  According to the UP Project 
Fiscal Year 2007 Progress Report, total expenditures for the program from 2002 to December 
2008 totaled approximately $2,290,000.  It appears that a substantial amount of federal funding 
would be needed to initiate a similar native plant materials project in northern Arizona (Table 
5.4).

Lack of a consistent and reliable demand is a major obstacle to those who supply native 
seed.  Many demand survey respondents indicated that the amount of seed (in pounds) needed 
within the next five years was low (0-100 pounds).   Most seed that is purchased goes in 

109 
 
rehabilitating burned lands and the low estimates of the amount of seed needed could be a direct 
result of fire size and frequency as difficult factors to predict.  When investigating further, the 
“other” responses revealed that this amount is highly dependent on fire size and frequency and 
affects project acreage, another key determinant when deciding how much native seed was 
purchased.   
Unpredictability of fire size and severity ultimately leads to an inconsistent and 
unpredictable demand, another limiting factor leading to insecurity in the market.  Many 
commercial seed producers feel limited by the lack of consistent and reliable demand for native 
plant materials as well as their lack of knowledge about production techniques which are needed 
to successfully develop native plant materials.  Increased information sharing between producers, 
agencies, and scientists could help to increase development of reliable materials.  Furthermore, 
from a supply perspective the risk is far too high to invest time and effort into producing 
materials which may not be sold or yield large enough quantities to be profitable.  Expansion of a 
native plants market into the Colorado Plateau region may make those materials produced more 
easily sold by catering to a larger group of buyers.   Developing ways to guarantee a consistent 
demand would also encourage suppliers to initiate native plant production.  Long-term contracts 
with federal agencies have been used as tools to create market guarantees.  However, when 
organizations/agencies were asked if they would be willing to enter long-term contracts with a 
certified native seed company, the majority (80%) stated “no,” with “other” comments revealing 
that current agency policies do not allow long-term contracts.   This option may need to be 
explored further.   
Some organizations/agencies have established restoration programs and, although they 
have helped to increase research and development of native plant materials, amounts of native 

110 
 
plant supplies are still limited.  In order to initiate a successful native plant market additional 
programs leading to a more adequate supply of locally-adapted native plant materials would be 
useful.  These programs would thus act to increase the research needed for further native plant 
materials development.  By collaborating with federal and state agencies, funding for 
restoration/rehabilitation may be possible.

VI. Conclusion and Recommendations 
 
Increased severity of disturbance events, revegetation policies, and concerns about the 
genetic consequences of using non-local plant materials have led to a high demand for locally-
adapted plant materials to support the increasing numbers of large-scale revegetation projects 
within northern Arizona.  However, many factors have become constraints hindering the 
development of a native plants market.  Before northern Arizona can move forward in initiating a 
market, effort should be concentrated on resolving several issues this study has identified 
including the need for:  (1) a clear definition of the term “local-genotype” agreed upon by all 
entities involved in the native plant market, (2) consistent management decisions across agency 
boundaries concerning the use of native plant materials, (3) increased availability and lowered 
cost of native plant materials, (4) a consistent and reliable demand for native plant materials, (5) 
increased communication and information sharing among producers, land managers, buyers, and 
researchers (6) stronger collaboration/partnerships among federal, state, private, and non-profit 
entities, and (7) a stable funding mechanism for the development of native plant materials. 
Both suppliers and purchasers agree that locally-adapted materials are important but, the 
extreme elevation and climate conditions within northern Arizona region make it difficult to 
come to agreement on an exact definition of the term “local-genotype.”  Defining this term will 
be an important factor in determining the composition of the local supply and which species are 
produced.  A promising finding from the survey revealed grass seed appears to be in highest 
demand within the region.  Focusing on grass seed development may be important during the 
market initiation phase. 
Because of increased policies on certification and the use of native plant materials, most 
commercial seed producers are able to provide native and certified seed, but, these materials 

112 
 
often come at a higher cost.  The overall importance of using certified seed is a clear indication 
that the native plant market and native plant communities would benefit from a standard policy 
making the use of certified seed mandatory on all revegetation projects regardless of agency type 
or size.  Stronger policies on the use of certified seed would help increase demand for these 
materials, thus, eventually decreasing their cost. Furthermore, due to recent research efforts, 
agencies have begun to recognize the importance of using locally-adapted plant materials, and 
federal and state revegetation policies now incorporate the use of genetically appropriate native 
plant materials for restoration.  However, management decisions lack consistency across agency 
boundaries and, it appears that cost and availability of these materials continues to limit their use, 
making implementation of stronger native plant policies difficult.   
The lack of availability and high cost of native plant materials prevent buyers from 
purchasing these materials. Many organizations/agencies have begun to supply some of their 
own native plant materials.  However, seed collectors often lack the level of skill needed to 
correctly identify and collect viable seed.  Although some of these groups have obtained 
equipment for production, the equipment being used lacks the necessary quality needed to 
produce native plant materials on a large-scale basis.  Producing an adequate supply of locally-
adapted plant materials which are sold at a reasonable cost will be needed in creating a localized 
market.   
It appears that providing a higher more consistent demand will be essential to lower 
market prices.  Suppliers are hesitant to produce native plant materials because of the lack of 
knowledge associated with producing those materials and the inconsistent and unreliable 
demand.   Growers are reluctant to grow native plant species if successful seed production, 
harvesting, and processing information is not available.  Information and technology transfer 

113 
 
would encourage potential suppliers to grow species needed and improve the quality and cost of 
the materials produced.  Similarly, buyers are more likely to purchase materials of high quality 
and viability which are vital factors that lead to a successful restoration project.  Therefore, 
increased research developing important production protocols for species identified as most 
important to the northern Arizona native plant materials market will be important before getting 
reliable seeds into the hands of producers.   
Stewardship contracting and buy-back programs have been successfully initiated through 
multi-agency agreements have been used to provide suppliers the guarantee of demand that need.  
For example, in 2004 the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest offered a 10-year stewardship 
contract to thin 150,000 acres of ponderosa pine within the forest considered to be vulnerable to 
fire and insect attacks.  Through this contract, the development of wood fiber industries was 
encouraged by providing a guaranteed supply of wood to those industries for ten years (Neary 
and Zieroth, 2007).  Both the GBRI and the UP Project have created buy-back programs to 
encourage commitment from growers and accelerate development of native seed supplies.  Seeds 
developed by the Great Basin Native Plant Selection and Increase Project or collected from BLM 
areas of concern and are provided to growers.  In turn, contracts are made for agencies to buy-
back a portion of the seed quantities produced (GBNPSIP, 2002).   Creation of a stable demand 
should be a top priority.  Long-term contracts or buy-back options to growers could provide a 
mechanism in which a consistent demand can be given to growers.   
Over time, a large amount of information concerning native plant materials production 
has been acquired.   The GBRI and UP Project are good examples of groups which have acted to 
stimulate markets in neighboring regions and act as an important source of production and 
market information.  The GBRI and UP Project can be used as models and, although their region 

114 
 
of interest encompasses landscapes different than northern Arizona, their efforts have provided 
examples which could help initiate a native plant materials market.  The success of the GBRI and 
UP Projects can be attributed to several important components.  Both have resulted from 
collaborative efforts among federal and state agencies, private entities and local organizations, 
and the need for improving severely degraded rangeland conditions.  The GBRI has been 
supported by regionally integrating federal and state funding appropriations (GBRI, 2001), while 
the UP Project receives the majority of its funding through partnerships with federal, state, 
private, and nonprofit entities, as well as independent sources (UP Project, 2007).   
Northern Arizona encompasses some of the United States’ most diverse ecosystems, and 
the effects of large-scale disturbances could be mitigated by restoring native plant communities.  
The region is also home to a multitude of federal, state, private, and nonprofit entities.  Multi-
agency collaboration/partnership could create needed sources of funding to increase locally-
adapted revegetation materials.  Successes achieved by GBRI and the UP Project may also be 
attributed to their regions’ long history of agriculture and favorable climate conditions.  
Therefore, the extreme environmental conditions within northern Arizona cannot be overlooked 
and may present the most difficult variable to overcome when initiating a market.  First, water is 
scarce and drought conditions are predicted to continue and become more severe.  Second, a 
great deal of uniform land is needed to develop large quantities of native plant materials, 
specifically grasses.  Extreme elevation and precipitation gradients are also present within the 
region.  Elevation and precipitation are important factors in determining vegetation communities.  
These gradients change abruptly and, therefore, vegetation communities can change within a 
short distance.  Thus, uniformity within the landscape is rare.  Many areas within the region also 
contain soils which may not optimal for native plant production purposes.   

115 
 
With an increasing demand for locally-adapted native plant materials within the region 
and an interest in its development, a market opportunity exists.  Northern Arizona clearly poses 
unique challenges to native plant production and a diverse approach to initiating a market may be 
needed.  However, it is clear that a coordinated effort is needed to increase communication 
between producers, land managers, buyers, and researchers.   Poor communication within 
existing native plant markets has hindered their progress.  Increasing communication would 
assist in market development and increase the possibility for market success.   Communication 
should aim to establish agreements on a common set of definitions and standards for native plant 
materials, the types and amounts of materials needed to be produced, costs associated with native 
plant materials, and areas of priority for future research.  A large effort should also focus on 
accumulating, organizing and disseminating any available information on native plant markets 
and production.    
Although in its infancy, the Northern Arizona Native Seed Alliance (NANSA) has begun 
to address many of these issues through coordinating and information sharing among producers, 
land managers, buyers, and researchers.  It aims to facilitate research investigating the 
requirements and techniques needed for growing native plant materials and selecting genetically 
and ecologically appropriate species to be used in revegetation projects in northern Arizona.      
Further investigation of issues this study identifies will help to determine the most 
feasible approach to initiating a native plant market within the region and solutions to the most 
salient issues this study has identified.   Specifically, further investigation of options that would 
secure funding through collaboration for market initiation would be useful.  Additionally, 
stewardship contracting and buy-back options should be explored further to help ensure suppliers 
a guaranteed demand.   This study has identified principal species buyers would like to see 

116 
 
brought into production.   An economic study evaluating costs associated with development and 
production of each species along with species profitability margins would be beneficial.   
Identifying individuals interested in producing native plant materials with land capable of 
production would be helpful.   Furthermore, the information gathered from the survey could be 
used to create a useful database of Arizona native seed suppliers and buyers of native seed.  This 
database could be available to current suppliers and buyers as well as the public online and/or 
could be printed in a directory form.  Creating and administering a more advanced survey where 
the questions are improved and sample size is increased would be beneficial to future research.

Study Summary 
 
1. Changing climate conditions, fire suppression, non-native species invasion, exploitation 
of rangelands, urbanization, and use of nonlocal genotype plant materials has lead to an 
alteration of soil and plant resources and an overall loss of native plant community 
productivity and diversity as well as disrupting the ecosystems they rely on (Milton et al., 
1994; Monsen and McArthur, 1995; Holmgren and Scheffer, 2001).   As disturbance 
events increase, revegetation of disturbed lands will be needed, and the use of locally-
adapted plant materials will become increasingly valuable to restore genetic diversity.  
Thus, demand for locally-adapted native plant materials will increase. 
2. Many revegetation policies currently require the use of native species “when available”, 
but because of the limited quantities produced, agencies continue to use non-native 
species for revegetation of disturbed wildlands.  Although policies have made available 
funding to develop various native plant programs to increase the supply of native plant 
materials, these programs have been unable to produce these materials on a large-scale 
basis.  Agencies have begun to recognize the value of using locally-adapted plant 
materials when vegetating disturbed lands and new policies on their use have arisen. 
However, management decisions on their use lack consistency across agency boundaries 
while high costs and lack of availability of these materials makes implementation of 
stronger native plant policies difficult.   
3. The amount of large-scale restoration projects has increased due to an increase in 
disturbance events throughout northern Arizona.  Federal, state, private, and non-profit 
organizations alike are experiencing the need for locally-adapted native plant materials to 
restore these disturbed areas.  Currently, there is a lack of abundance of these materials 

118 
 
within the region.  Research on native plant materials production has increased and the 
information and equipment needed for production have become available.  The GBRI and 
the UP Project have acted as models to help create regional efforts and provided the 
information needed to assess the initiation of a native plant market within the region. 
4. Based on the GBRI and UP Project as models, the estimated cost per species for 
collection, research, increase and release is about $15,000-$25,000 per year and the 
average timeframe for development of a species ranges from 4-12 years.  Most of the 
funding for current projects comes from federal agencies (BLM and USFS).  The amount 
of funding needed for initiation of a similar project in northern Arizona is estimated to be 
between $500,000 and $800,000 for the first year and between $2,437,000 and 
$6,000,000 over a five year period.  Most monies should be provided by federal entities.   
5. It appears that within the current market there is a variable demand for native plant 
materials due to unpredictable fire size and frequency and policy decisions.   An 
inconsistent and unreliable demand has made suppliers hesitant in further development of 
native plant materials.  Stewardship contracting and buy-back programs could be used to 
provide suppliers the guarantee of demand they need.   
6. Lack of communication among producers, land managers, buyers, and researchers 
appears to be a major limiting factor to the initiation of a successful native plant materials 
market in northern Arizona.  A large effort is needed to accumulate, organize, and 
disseminate available information on native plant materials production.  Partnerships 
between producers, government agencies, land managers and organizations proves to be 
an effective method obtaining important native plant material information and the 
funding needed for market initiation.

Appendix C. Annotated Questionnaire - Demand 
 
A total of 42 questions were administered to 37 consumers of native seed in the Northern 
Arizona Native Plant Materials Market Feasibility Survey.  Answer frequencies (n) and valid 
percents of survey results for each question are summarized in an Annotated Questionnaire 
below. 
 
In cases where respondents answered “Don’t Know” and “Decline to Answer,” these responses 
were counted as “missing” and were omitted in calculating valid percent. In addition, valid 
percents were rounded which may cause total percents to equal slightly more or less than 100. 
For the multiple response questions, where respondents were able to select more than one 
answer, the total n may be higher than the number of respondents. In these cases, valid percents 
were calculated by the number (n) in each response category divided by the total number of 
responses for the question.  Where respondent answers were identical in the open response 
questions/sections, the total (n) duplicated responses are represented in parenthesis after the 
stated response.  See Appendix I for a full list of scientific names and authorities used in this 
questionnaire.

Comments Q38: 
1. Not only plant community seed mixes, but xeric, mesic, and wet site mixes within a project. 
2. This would be preferred for post-fire seeding; most likely Burned Area Emergency 
Rehabilitation  
    rather than National Park Service would be purchasing this seed. 
3. It depends on too many factors to have a simple answer. 
4. Again, it depends on the relevance of the species to that area 
5. Depends on the state of the "ecosystem"

Comments Q39: 
1. As a federal agency, we are not allowed to do so...but will support in other ways. 
2. If they produce the seed we need when we need it. 
3. Contracting and procurement policy would limit long-term contracts 
4. Would depend on the project and duration 
5. Many factors to consider here

Q40. Are there any general comments that you would like to add regarding the topics of this 
survey? 
 
1. We are an interstate natural gas transmission company which adheres to federal, state and 
local regulations pertaining to reseeding and restoration 
2. We do not use large quantities of seed like those amounts necessary for large seedling 
project.  We produce plants/seedlings for research, wildlife habitat improvement, and fire 
rehabilitation/restoration projects.  A lot of our propagation is also from cuttings.  We 
have produced over 250,000 plants which have been put into the field over the last 3 
years.  Almost 50,000 Fremont cottonwoods and native willows in the last two years 
strictly from cuttings.  Besides seed local gardens which hold different genotypes of 
Fremont cottonwood and willows would be useful as a source for cuttings.  Local gardens 
with different local genotypes of aspen would also be useful for cuttings for future 
project. 
3. Seed pound/cost only an estimate 
4. Before the market is developed, there needs to be a concerted effort to determine the 
feasibility of planting the various native seeds through existing equipment as well as what 
the seeding and germination requirements of the species are. For example there seems to 
be very little information on how deep Needle and Thread grass seeds need  to be seeded 
not to mention how breaking the awns off the seed (as is currently done0 during 
processing affects it's ability to germinate. Not to mention if it can be effectively seeded 
in combination with other seed with different requirements. Other unanswered questions 
are how to effectively seed into established mediterranean annual stands. Until we can 
understand some of these issues, we will waste most of our time and money trying. 
5. I am sure your results will underscore the NEED for more native plant material 
production.  How will you use the results??? 
6. Our new seed collector is new and untested. We are not sure how the whole process will 
work from harvesting to processing to storage.  So, this is a big unknown factor on how 
much seed we will need from out-side sources. 
7. My answers are only relevant to Hart Prairie Preserve, not the entire Nature Conservancy. 
8. Our work is mainly on the lower Colorado River; however the seed companies that we 
obtain seed from are in San Diego and Utah. It would be great to have a local grower. 
Some seed is hard to propagate in field conditions and the plants are better planted as 
plugs. 
9. NRCS has a plant materials program that is developing native plant species for use in the 
region.  We would like to see these better utilized by growers for use in their adapted 
ranges. 
10. Development of seed sources of regional ecotypes of native species is critical for use 
post-fire, for revegetation, for weed and erosion control and for general revegetation 
needs.  Thanks for working on this project. 
11. We will utilize local native seed whenever possible.  If we had a reliable source, and 
costs, quality, supply, etc were conducive to our procurement regulations, we would 
utilize local sources as a priority. 
12. Most of our activities have been in southern Arizona or along the Central Arizona Project 
alignment through Sonoran desert biome 
13. Is there a separation between small scale and large scale markets? 

197 
 
14. Because the topic of this survey is so complicated, having a comment section associated 
each question would be helpful.  That way you could explain "yes" or "no" if needed. 
15. There needs to be a local outlet to be available to us here in Northern Arizona, possible in 
Flagstaff. 
16. I cannot speak for my agency as a whole.  I can only answer questions that relate to my 
direct experience including as few fire rehabilitation projects (BAER). I cannot address 
the willingness of the Forest Service to enter into long-term contracts 
17. We did have a seedling program for a number of years. It was disbanded and I am not 
aware of any plans for us to reinstate any of these programs.

Appendix  C. Annotated Questionnaire - Supply 
 
A total of 37 questions were administered to 33 consumers of native seed in the Northern 
Arizona Native Plant Materials Market Feasibility Survey.  Answer frequencies (n) and valid 
percents of survey results for each question are summarized in an Annotated Questionnaire 
below. 
 
In cases where respondents answered “Don’t Know” and “Decline to Answer,” these responses 
were counted as “missing” and were omitted in calculating valid percent. In addition, valid 
percents were rounded which may cause total percents to equal slightly more or less than 100. 
For the multiple response questions, where respondents were able to select more than one 
answer, the total n may be higher than the number of respondents. In these cases, valid percents 
were calculated by the number (n) in each response category divided by the total number of 
responses for the question.  Where respondent answers where duplicated in the open response 
questions/sections, the total (n) duplicated responses is represented in parenthesis after the stated 
response.  See Appendix I for a full list of scientific names and authorities used in this 
questionnaire.

Comments Q2: 
1. Problems using local genotype plants or seeds that we run into is that they don't fit a large 
    enough area and you can run into collectors charging huge prices if the demand is great.   
    There is never enough of the types that you are looking for to seed large areas and it takes a 
    long time to grow enough to be of use.  We run into this problem all the time.   The best  
    approach is to have the plant materials centers select viable varieties that fit larger areas.  A lot 
    of the times the local genotype varieties have a difficult time become established and 
    competing. 
2. The variability of fire makes difficult to inventory quantities of local genotypes that may or  
    may not be sold. 
3. The majority of our seed sales not influenced by local genotype 
4. It is not always practical.  There is a chicken and egg problem with localized material. 
5. Very important for woody species (as required by federal law); very important for forbs 
6. The answer to this question can vary dramatically from species to species. In other words, 
    some species are more adaptable than others. 
7. It is important to us if it is important to our customers 
8. It is dependent upon customer requests - we sell a lot of native grass seeds for reclamation and 
    maintenance. 
 
 
Q3. Is there a current market to sell local genotype plants and seeds that will be used for large-

Comments Q3: 
1. In some places 
2. The problem is that we can't get good seed stock to grow enough seed to fit any project of any 
    size quick enough.   Example is if you have a project that required a collected variety.  The 
    cost at the time of bid was $100.00 per pls lb.  By the time the project was seeded the price 
    had gone up to $1,000.00 per Pure Live Seed pound because of the weather and availability of 
    the seed and the person who had tied up all the seed and raised the price.   If it is not available  
    in the commercial market place by many players the price of the seed will be huge 
3. A very small market 
4. Very limited 
5. Yes, along the Sierra front where most of my business is. 
6. Hard to answer, both yes and no, unpredictable. 
7. This depends on the species and is typically more true for seed 
8. As long as the production is kept private. 
9. It varies depending on the location of the restoration project and the adaptability of the species 
    being replaced. If widely adapted species are being replaced then the importance of using 
    locally adapted species diminishes. 
10. There may be on occasion but enough to create a stable market. 
11. In my opinion this is beginning to grow to the size of large scale.

Other responses Q12: 
1. You should have “All of the Above”, if you are talking about local genotype or all native 
    seeds.  It makes a great deal of difference.  Local genotype is a huge amount of time and labor 
    finding varieties that you can grow. It is extremely expensive and time consuming. 
2. Weed control 
3. For the past few years it would be available land for production.  Currently, the price of wheat 
    and corn, have impacted the available acres for production of native species. 
4. Reliable seed production of native seed species. Private increase of native seed species is 
    unreliable and varies too dramatically to make it financially worth-while. Native collection of 
    locally adapted species is more reliable and cost effective.

Q35. Are there any general comments that you would like to add regarding the topics of this 
survey? 
 
1. Going through your questions, I can't think of all the problems that we have run into with 
    regard to native seed.  You talk about 25 acre areas, what about when you have wildfires, 
    floods, or other major events.  How do you provide the genotype for the area to cover these  
    events, and if you plant seed from outside the area that you are talking about don't you 
    contaminate what you are trying to accomplish.  There is no way a present where you can 
    grow enough genotype seed to fit all the needs out there. As each region wants more and more 
    species only the cost is going to put all out of reach for any project.   I would have to see 
    genotype and other native species of the same type planted in test plots side by side in every 
    area that shows planting genotypes grown only within a small local area are better.   And I 
    haven't seen it done yet 
2. For me, it seems geared for larger operators, not small timers like myself doing this mostly for 
    xeriscaping of small properties. 
3. Location of each person answering the survey will make a big difference on the kind of native  
    business they do.  For example land managers in low precip zones are happy when anything, 
    native or not, grows.  Where a land manager in a high precip Zone >14 inches has the luxury 
    of being selective as there are far more species to choose from in that location. 
4. It is a little difficult to decide what the top sellers will be since it depends on what area you are 
    talking about. Restoration projects tend to be very species specific and that changes for each 
    location. Our success has come from trying to educate the public and we deal more with 
    individuals than agencies. 
5. Species supply and demand are highly volatile and change monthly 
6. Market dynamics/volatility defy rational decision making. 
7. I would recommend you review the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) purchases over the 
    previous 5 years.  Using that information you could get an excellent idea of which species are 
    in demand.  Visit www.fedbizops.gov for that info or contact the BLM out of Boise, Idaho.

8. Many of the questions did not apply to my small business. Though a high percentage of my 
    seeds are from native plants, my customers are wholesale nursery growers for the landscape & 
    retail nursery trades. I've worked to encourage the use of true native material, rather than 
    merely drought tolerant exotics, in the urban landscape. 
9. The most difficult aspect of supplying locally adapted species for our business is the red tape 
    and long delays related to the governing land agencies and the ability of the seed purchaser to 
    acquire funds. For example, the long drawn out process of the federal agencies procuring 
    money often outlasts the plants growing season and the plants often blossom, produce seed 
    and then shed their production before the agencies can get funding in place. This often delays 
    the agencies ability to purchase seed until the following season and the seed needs to go on the 
    ground now. The fact that federal agencies work on a fiscal year system that does not coincide  
    with the growing/harvest season does not help, either. Another problem is the following  
    example: the Fish and Game needs seed to plant a recent fire. The closest locally adapted seed 
    stand is located just over the next ridge from the planting site but is growing on US Forest  
    Service (USFS) land and the USFS won’t let you collect seed in that area. 
10. We are a small non-profit foundation and we do not do large scale projects. 
11. As I stated in my answers, the selection of the seeds and plants that will be in demand are 
      very customer and site specific. We feel that there is not one grass or plant that works well in 
      all locations and situations. Another thing to take into consideration is the constant  
      development of new viable types of native plants that are being researched and will be 
      available in the next 5-10 years. 
12. Most of the questions on this survey do not fit our company.  We distribute wildflower seeds, 
      some of which are native types -- we do not offer specific eco-types, seed grown in certain  
      areas, do native collection.  Seed native to the United States is not just grown in the United 
      States.  Your survey is more suited to companies that grow in their location for application in     
      their region or are involved in hand collection. 
13. If there is a market then you can damn well bet there will be someone there to produce what  
      is needed.
