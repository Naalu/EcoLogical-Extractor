Ecological Restoration Treatments Increase
Butterfly Richness and Abundance: Mechanisms
of Response
Amy E. M. Waltz1,2 and W. Wallace Covington1
Abstract
Few ecosystem restoration studies evaluate whether
arthropods are important components of ecosystem
recovery. We tested the hypothesis that ponderosa pine
restoration treatments would increase adult butterfly
species richness and abundance as a direct result of
increased understory diversity and abundance. To examine
mechanisms that potentially affect adult butterfly distribu-
tion, we quantified host plant frequency, nectar plant
abundance, and insolation (light intensity) in restoration
treatment and control forests. This study is unique,
because this is the first invertebrate monitoring in
ponderosa pine forest restoration treatments in the U.S.
Southwest and also because these treatments are the first
replicated ponderosa pine restoration treatments at a
landscape scale. Three patterns emerged: (1) butterfly
species richness and abundance were 2 and 3 times greater,
respectively, in restoration treatment units than in paired
control forests 1 year after treatment, and 1.5 and 3.5 times
greater, respectively, 2 years after treatment, ordination of
control and treatment sampling units using butterfly
assemblages showed significant separation of control and
restoration treatment units after restoration treatment;
(2) host plant and nectar plant species richness showed
little difference between treated and control forests even 2
years after treatment; and (3) insolation (light intensity)
was significantly greater in treated forests after restoration.
We suggest that changes in the butterfly assemblage may
occur due to light intensity effects before plant community
changes occur or can be detected. Butterfly assemblage
differences will have additional cascading effects on the
ecosystem as prey for higher trophic levels and through
plant interactions including herbivory and pollination.
Key words: biodiversity, butterfly, ecological restoration,

Introduction
The goal of ecological restoration is to return ecosystems
to their pre-disturbed state with respect to ecosystem
structure, function, and composition (Hobbs & Norton
1996). However, most monitoring of terrestrial ecosystem
restoration projects in the past has not reflected these
goals but has instead primarily focused on structural eco-
system components, such as overstory or understory plant
composition, rather than on ecosystem functions and pro-
cesses, such as nitrogen cycling, plant pollination, and/or
trophic level interactions (Aronson et al. 1993; Hobbs &
Norton 1996; Covington et al. 1997; Kaye 1997).
Invertebrates show quick responses to ecosystem change
and disturbance and contribute to system sustainability
through processes such as decomposition, energy transfer,
and pollination (Recher et al. 1993; Andersen & Sparling
1997). Little is known about invertebrate response to
large-scale restoration projects, and few restoration or
reclamation studies monitor the recovery of invertebrate
fauna (Holl 1996; Andersen & Sparling 1997; Majer 1997;
Davies et al. 1999). To accurately address questions of
restoration success, monitoring must include measures of
process, function, and ecosystem integrity (Aronson et al.
1993), notably difficult attributes to understand, let alone
measure (Hobbs & Norton 1996). This study was the first
invertebrate-monitoring study in ponderosa pine forest
restoration treatments in the U.S. Southwest, although
restoration treatments have been proposed over tens of
thousands of acres of the ponderosa pine forests in this
region (Appropriations Bill 2001).
Open, park-like stands of ponderosa pine were con-
verted to dense, small-diameter pole stands with little
understory plant richness or abundance in the last 100–
150 years by the introduction of livestock grazing and the
subsequent disruption of fires (Covington et al. 1997).
Experimental
restoration
of
these
forests
has
been
initiated by using thinning to reduce current tree densities
and returning fire to the landscape. The resulting change
from a closed canopy forest with little or no herbaceous
plant community to an open canopy forest increased plant
diversity and plant production (Covington et al. 1997;

Springer et al. 2000). This in turn has ramifications for
changes in the abundance and diversity of herbivore
arthropods (Erhardt & Thomas 1991; Siemann et al.
1997). Treated forests also showed increases in soil mois-
ture and soil temperature when compared with control
forests due to decreased aboveground biomass (trees)
(Covington et al. 1997). Both factors are positively correl-
ated with the success rate of arthropod pupation (Erhardt
& Thomas 1991; Scoble 1992). Finally, fire intensity,
patchiness, and seasonality have been shown to determine
arthropod community structure (Whelan 1995; Reed 1997;
Andersen & Muller 2000; Wikars & Schimmel 2001).
This study examined the changes in butterfly species
richness and abundance to ponderosa pine restoration
treatments. Adult butterflies are well described, are often
amenable to field studies, and can be quick to respond to
environmental change (Erhardt 1985; Erhardt & Thomas
1991; Scoble 1992). Many butterfly larvae are host specific
and host on a variety of plants including grasses, forbs,
shrubs, and trees. As adults, butterflies are nectar general-
ists; both life stages represent a broad range of ecological
niches within an ecosystem. Because of the broad life
history traits found in butterflies, this taxon has been
recommended a good ecological indicator of herbaceous
communities (Scoble 1992), other herbivorous arthropods
(Brown 1991; Scoble 1992; Beccaloni & Gaston 1995), and
even other taxonomic groups (Wilcox et al. 1986; Carroll
& Pearson 1998).
Butterfly response to habitat disturbances such as log-
ging has been mixed. Although butterflies have shown
decreases in abundances after clear-cut-logging events
(Hill et al. 1995), other studies showed that openings in
forests, including changes created by roadways and paths,
often had higher butterfly abundances than nearby forests
(Pollard et al. 1975). This butterfly abundance increase in
forest gaps was most likely due to increased host plant
diversity and light availability (Sparks et al. 1996). For
example, Meyer & Sisk (2001) showed significant butterfly
behavioral responses as a direct effect of microclimate
differences
in
ponderosa
pine
restoration
treatment
edges. In addition, butterfly response to flowering plant
species richness has been mixed, with some studies show-
ing plant species richness correlated with butterfly abun-
dance (Kremen 1994; Holl 1995) and other studies showing
little correlation between the butterfly community and the
plant community (Holl 1996).
These studies suggested two general hypotheses of adult
butterfly response to ponderosa pine forest restoration
treatments. We sampled butterfly communities in restor-
ation treatment and control units to test the hypotheses
that: (1) Butterfly richness and abundance would initially
decrease in response to tree thinning and ground distur-
bance and then increase with the increasing herbaceous
community (Hill et al. 1995; Spitzer et al. 1997); and that
(2) generalist butterflies would dominate the initial butter-
fly assemblage, with turnover to specialist butterflies in
subsequent years, because the plant community shifted
from disturbance-adapted plants to late-successional plants
(Steffan-Dewenter & Tscharntke 1997). We then exam-
ined three specific mechanisms that might explain adult
butterfly distributions in treated and control forests. We
asked: (1) do host plant distributions differ between
restoration treatment units and control units? (2) do nectar
resources differ between restoration treatment units and
control units? and (3) does insolation (light intensity)
change after restoration treatments?
Methods
Study Site
The study site used for this research was a ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa) and Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii)
forest (UTM coordinates 306000 E; 4024600 N, Zone
12 S) located between Mt. Logan and Mt. Trumbull,
about 35 kilometers north of the Grand Canyon on the
Arizona Strip. This land is managed by the Bureau of Land
Management and fell within the recently designated Grand
Canyon, Parashant National Monument. Mt. Logan, Mt.
Trumbull, and the surrounding highlands formed a sky
island of ponderosa pine, with desert grassland to the
north and the Grand Canyon to the south. The nearest
ponderosa pine forest was about 100 km east, on the
Kaibab plateau. The elevation of the sky island ranged
from 1,675 m to 2,620 m. The area received an average of
40–45 cm of precipitation per year and contained some of
the biota of the Great Basin (Welsh 1987), in addition to the
flora of northern Arizona (Kearney & Peebles 1951). The
forest was predominately ponderosa pine, although Gambel
oak composed 15% of the overstory (Waltz & Fule´ 1998).
Other tree species in the area included New Mexico
locust (Robinia neomexicana), quaking aspen (Populus
tremuloides), pinyon (Pinus edulis), and Utah juniper
(Juniperus osteospermus). The woody and herbaceous
understory component was dominated by big sagebrush
(Artemesia tridentata) and showed evidence of invasion by
non-native species, such as cheat grass (Bromus tectorum),
and some wheatgrasses (Agropyron spp). Although over 300
herbaceous species were documented at the Mt. Trumbull
site in the last 5 years (J.D. Springer, Ecological Restoration
Institute, Northern Arizona University, 2000, personal
communication), the forest floor cover before restoration
treatments was 70% litter and duff, with only 15% of the
cover represented by live plants (Waltz & Fule´ 1998).
Approximately 1,450 ha of the 5,000-ha forest were tar-
geted for ponderosa pine restoration treatment in 1995,
and as of 2001, approximately 250 ha were thinned and
burned. Within this area, four experimental blocks were
established in 1997 (EB1, EB2, EB3, and EB4). Each
block was divided into two units, and each unit randomly
assigned as control or restoration treatment. Experimental
blocks differed in size, but 20 monitoring plots were estab-
lished on a consistent 7.2-ha grid in each unit for a total
of 40 plots per experimental block. Plot grids were

established at least 50 m from treatment unit boundaries.
The treatment units were treated fall/winter of 1999–2000.
All experimental blocks were located in ponderosa pine
forests. The four experimental blocks varied in soil type,
forest density, forest composition, and herbaceous cover
and were chosen to represent the variability in vegetation,
topography, and land-use history of the Mt. Trumbull–Mt.
Logan forest. Block 1, located on shallow lava/cinder soils
(EB1): this block had low tree density, consisting almost
entirely of ponderosa pine, with many living pre-settle-
ment (old growth) trees. There was a large shrub compo-
nent in this block, primarily serviceberry (Amelanchier
utahensis) and wax currant (Ribes cereum). Block 2
(EB2): this block had a strong Gambel oak component
with an abundant herbaceous understory, including sage-
brush openings, on basalt soils. Block 3 (EB3): at the
highest elevation, block 3 was dominated by large, pre-
settlement ponderosa pine and also had Gambel oak and
New Mexico locust throughout the unit. This unit was one
of the largest (approximately 40 ha) and was predomi-
nately on cinder soils. The control unit of EB3 was lost
to wildfire in the spring of 2000. Thus, post-treatment EB3
control data were collected from a similar site established
in the spring of 2000 (EB3 Control-2000). Block 4 (EB4):
this was representative of the densest stands of ponderosa
pine forest at the Mt. Trumbull site. The overstory con-
sisted of dense ponderosa pines, some oak clumps, and
some pinyon and juniper at its western end. This block
was on basalt soils and had few living pre-settlement pon-
derosa pines.
This complete randomized block design was one of the
first in landscape-level terrestrial restoration treatments
and allowed a larger inference of observed results of thin-
ning and burning in ponderosa pine forests. The paired
treatment and control units accounted for annual environ-
mental fluctuations. This was important, because the four
sampling years represented seasons after severe drought
(1997 and 2000) and record snowfall years (1998 and 2001).
Butterfly populations showed drastic differences in total
species richness and abundance throughout these years,
but overall trends between treatment and control units
were consistent. Throughout the analyses, an n of 4 was
used to determine differences between restoration treat-
ments and control forest stands and probabilities of a type
a error less than 0.10 were used to denote significant
differences.
Butterfly Sampling
Butterfly monitoring data presented were collected from
control and treatment units within each block in 1997,
1998, 2000, and 2001. Sampling years 1997 and 1998 were
before treatment, and sampling years 2000 and 2001 fol-
lowed restoration treatment. Butterfly monitoring trans-
ects (Pollard 1977) totaling 900 m per unit were established
in 1997 in the control and treatment units of every block
except block 2, where only 600 transect meters were estab-
lished in each treatment unit due to block shape and size.
Transects followed the monitoring plot grid of 20 plots
placed 60 m apart (Fig. 1). Plot grids were centered in
units, and butterfly transects were placed 50 m from unit
boundaries to minimize edge effects.
Transects were monitored every 2 weeks, between May
and August, for a total of six surveys per year. Diurnal
butterflies are very sensitive to cool and windy conditions
and often limit their flights on cloudy, cool days, thereby
reducing chance of observation. Therefore, sampling
occurred between 1000 and 1600 hr, on days warmer than
17  C, with winds less than 15 kph, and mostly sunny skies
(Pollard 1977). A total of 5 min per 100 m was spent look-
ing for butterflies. Butterfly species encountered on each
transect were recorded, along with location along transect
and lateral distance from transect (perpendicular to trans-
ect). In addition, for each observation, we recorded beha-
vior (i.e., nectaring, basking, and flying), and if a specimen
was collected. If the butterfly could not be identified in
flight, attempts were made to capture and collect the
insect. The timed portion of the survey corresponded
only to the search time and did not include time spent in
pursuit of a butterfly.
Species richness and abundance data were totaled from
the six surveys taken each year and summarized for each

block and treatment. We assumed that butterflies were
equally likely to be detected in the two treatments up to
10 m away from the observer, and therefore only butter-
flies observed within 10 meters of the transect line were
used in the analyses. Summaries of species richness were
used to get the total number of species observed over the
summer. Abundances were also summed across the sea-
son, because many of the species observed had a 2- or 3-
week life span. Although there were some exceptions,
abundance surveys every 2 weeks were assumed to count
different individuals. Changes in butterfly richness and
abundance were analyzed for a significant treatment–year
interaction with a repeated measures
ANOVA (n 5 4
blocks) using repeated contrasts to test for differences
between treatment units among years (Hopkins 2000). To
determine which butterfly families contributed to overall
patterns, total family abundances were also analyzed for
changes due to treatment with repeated measure analysis
followed by repeated contrasts.
Compositional changes in the butterfly assemblage were
assessed
with
non-metric
multidimensional
scaling
(NMDS),
using
a
Bray–Curtis
dissimilarity
measure
(Faith et al. 1987; Minchin 1987) to place multidimensional
data in ordination space. Ordination results were then
analyzed with a blocked MRPP (Zimmerman et al. 1985)
to test the hypothesis of no differences between treatment
and control units, using an a of 0.10. Ordination and statis-
tical tests were performed using PCORD software (McCune &
Mefford 1999).
Host Plant and Nectar Resource Distribution
To examine the first mechanistic question, how host plant
frequency differed between control and restoration treat-
ment units, the herbaceous community was quantified
through experimental sampling plots established in each
block by Ecological Restoration Institute (Northern Ari-
zona University) staff (Fig. 1, monitoring plots) (Waltz
et al. 2003). In 1997 and 1998, pre-treatment data were
collected once from 40 0.04 ha plots per block, 20 each in
control and treatment units. Plots were placed on a 60 m
grid within the 7.2 ha sampling portion of the experimental
block. Post-treatment herbaceous data were collected from
all plots in both 2000 and 2001 to establish the early
successional herbaceous patterns after treatment. Herbac-
eous monitoring consisted of the point-intercept method
along one 50-m transect per plot. Every 30 cm along this
transect,
all
species
encountered
at
the
point
were
recorded. These methods provided plant species composi-
tion and frequency data.
Host plant frequency was assessed from collected data
by analyzing plant families known to contain important
hosts to the 10 most common butterflies. Six of the 10
most abundant butterflies were family specific as larvae,
which means larvae could successfully develop on multiple
species within one plant family (Scott 1984). Three of the
10 were species specific as larvae, and developed on only
one plant species. Only one top-10 butterfly larva was a
generalist and could have developed on a variety of species
from several plant families. We examined legumes (Faba-
ceae), mustards (Brassicaceae), asters (Asteraceae), the
foxgloves (Scrophulariaceae), and grasses (Poaceae) for
changes in frequency between untreated and restoration
treatment units. Because three of the most common but-
terflies hosted on tree species (New Mexico locust and
Gambel oak), changes in tree species abundances were
summarized from Waltz et al. (2001). The frequency of
the plant families were analyzed for differences between
control and treatment forests within each year, 1998, 2000,
and 2001, with a MANOVA (Sokal & Rohlf 1981). Signifi-
cant MANOVAs were followed by post hoc tests to deter-
mine differences amongst family groups.
To address the second mechanistic question of how
nectar resource abundance differed between restoration
treatment and control units, we used 1 m2 plots to examine
flowering species richness three times during the year. In
May, June, and July of 2000 and 2001 (post-treatment),
1 m2 plots were established every 20 m along the butterfly
monitoring transect after the vegetation-monitoring plot
grid (Fig. 1, nectar plant plots). A total of 45 plots were
sampled in each treatment and control unit in blocks 1, 3,
and 4, and 30 plots were sampled per treatment unit in
block 2. Abundance of nectar plants and blooms have been
shown to directly affect adult butterfly distributions (Steffan-
Dewenter & Tscharntke 1997). At each plot, we tallied
plants with blooming flowers by species. The flowering
plant species richness and abundance were summed across
all three surveys, because patterns were consistent through
the year, although flowering species composition changed.
These data were summarized by block and treatment and
then analyzed with a Kruskall–Wallace non-parametric
(Sokal & Rohlf 1981) test to determine differences in
flowering plant species richness and abundance (n 5 4
blocks).
We sampled a measure of light intensity to address the
third mechanistic question. Insolation [in log(lumens)/m2]
was measured and recorded with integrated Hobo datalog-
gers (Spectrum Technologies, Plainsfield, IL, U.S.A.). Sen-
sors were calibrated by the manufacturer before purchase.
These dataloggers measured light wavelengths between
400 and 1100 nm. We modified the dataloggers by remov-
ing a sticker on the front cover, which obstructed the
sensor at lower sun angles. In the field, the sensors were
placed in a clear Plexiglas case for protection from moist-
ure.
A total of 10 dataloggers was used to determine insola-
tion differences between treatment units within blocks.
Insolation data were collected once per season in 1998
(pre-treatment) and in 2000 (post-treatment). Five stations
were set up on randomly selected vegetation-monitoring
plots in the treatment and control of each block (Fig. 1,
light intensity dataloggers). Sensors were placed 1 m from
the ground. Data were collected in 4-min intervals from
one 24-hr period, during clear weather. Log(lumen)/m2

data were converted to mmols m22 s21 using conversion
equations by Thimijan & Heins (1982). Potential error
can occur when converting radiant flux density to photon
flux density, because the actual conversion rate may differ
at different wavelengths. The Hobo dataloggers do not
categorize data by wavelength. However, the trends and
relative values between treatment and control units before
and after treatment were the same using log(lumen)/m2
and mmols m22 s21; thus, the standard units were analyzed
and presented. Light intensity values were averaged for
three time periods during daylight hours to examine
differences between restoration treatment and control
units. The midday hours, 1100–1559 hr, coincided with
the butterfly-sampling period. The morning hours, 0800–
1059 hr, were examined, because insolation and air tem-
perature determine the time to flight temperature for
butterflies (Johnson 1969). Finally, hours between 1600
and 1759 hr were tested for differences between control
and treatment. Light intensity differences at this time of
day may influence length of foraging and mate search. A
block, treatment unit, average (e.g., block 3, control) was
calculated from the five insolation dataloggers for each
survey. Blocks were used as replicates with n 5 4. Differ-
ences between restoration treatment and control units
were assessed with a two-way ANOVA using treatment
unit and time class as factors (Sokal & Rohlf 1981).

of these included the silver-spotted skipper (Epargyreus
clarus Cramer, EPCL), the Gambel oak dusky-wing (Erynnis
telemachus Burns, ERTE), the silvery blue (Glaucopsyche
lygdamus Doubleday, GLLY), the orange sulfur (Colias
eurythemeBoisduval,COEU), andthecheckeredwhite(Pieris
protodice Boisduval and LeConte, PIPR). Host plants used by
the larvae of these butterflies ranged from legumes, mustards,
various shrubs, shrub/trees (New Mexico locust), and trees
(Gambel oak).
Although no significant butterfly assemblage differences
were found before restoration treatment (1997 and 1998), we
found up to two times as many butterfly species in restora-
tion treatments as in the control units 1 year after treatment
(2000) and 1.5 times as many species 2 years after treatment
(2001)
(Fig.2a)
(Repeated

increase in species, we also found five times as many
butterflies in treatment units as in paired control units in
post-treatment year 1 (2000) and 3.5 times as many butter-
flies were observed in post-treatment year 2 (2001) (Fig. 2b)
(Repeated Measures ANOVA year–treatment effect F 5 7.28,

Butterfly Family Responses:

mirror the community patterns observed above, these
results suggest that the community patterns were driven
largely by these two families.
Both the Nymphalidae and the Hesperiidae family abun-
dances were dominated by one species each in at least one
sampling year. Because of this, data were analyzed both
with and without E. clarus (EPCL) from the Hesperiidae
(Fig. 3c) and with and without Vanessa cardui (VACA)

ures ANOVA year–treatment F 5 2.0, p 5 0.149). Figure3c &
3d suggest that both species showed highest abundances in
treated forests in their respective ‘‘boom’’ years, but this was
not supported statistically.
Species Composition:
Spatial ordination of the butterfly
assemblage by NMDS showed no clear distinction between
treatment and control units before restoration treatment
(Fig. 4a & 4b). A blocked MRPP supported the hypothesis
that no differences existed between treatment and control
butterfly communities in pre-treatment years: the 1997
T-statistic 5 0.307, p 5 0.579 and the 1998 T-statistic 5
1.441, p 5 0.920. However, after restoration treatment
implementation in 1999, the restoration treatment units
showed a significant spatial separation from the control
units based on butterfly species abundance (Fig. 4c & 4d).
The
blocked
MRPP
showed
significant
differences
between control and treatment unit groupings: the 2000
T-statistic 5 21.849,
p 5 0.047
and
2001
T-statistic 5
22.272, p 5 0.032. In addition, an A (Agreement) statistic
was provided in the MRPP analysis as a descriptor of
within-group similarity; A 5 1 when all items within a
group are identical (McCune & Mefford 1999). After
restoration treatments, the A statistic was 0.093 in 2000
and 0.257 in 2001. A-statistic values less than 0.1 are com-
mon in community data, even with significant separation
of groups. The value of A 5 0.257 in 2001 is fairly high, and
we interpret that the butterfly assemblages within treat-
ment units after treatment had high similarity, regardless
of the block differences.
Although common species were observed in both con-
trol and restoration treatment units, less common species
(such as Copaeodes aurantiaca) when seen were in restor-
ation treatments (Table 1). We assumed for these analyses
that butterflies were just as likely to be observed in control
forests as in treated forests. Although the treated areas are
more open, researchers noticed more difficulty in detect-
ing butterflies in treated areas because of the structural
diversity in the understory (Waltz, personal observation).

treatments. (a) Butterfly species richness showed no differences between
treatment and control units before treatment (1998 and 1999) but showed
higher richness in treatment units after thinning and burning (repeated

species abundance was highly variable but showed no significant
differences before treatment and significantly greater abundances in the

Even with this potential bias, the restoration treatment
supported a more diverse butterfly community than the
control forests. As summarized in Table 1, V. cardui was
the most common individual species observed and was
observed three times more frequently in treatment units
than in control units. This species was rarely seen before
2001, but extremely high migration rates in 2001 made this
the most common species observed across both post-
treatment sample years. Total Lycaenids ranked first in
the treatment units but were the sixth most observed
taxon in control units. Lycaenidae species were often
difficult to identify during transect observations. As a
result, the total identified species in Table 1 is under-
estimated. Pieris species (whites) were highly abundant in
the area but observed three times as frequently in treated
areas after treatment. In 1998, Limenitis bredowii was
found in higher abundances in control forests in a different
experiment (Waltz & Covington 1999), but this pattern did
not remain consistent in 2000 and 2001.

Mechanisms of Adult Butterfly Distribution
We next examined potential mechanisms for increased
butterfly species richness and abundance in treated forests.
The first mechanistic question addressed was: did host
plant availability differ between restored and treated
plots? Pre-treatment data from the monitoring plots
showed that blocks had similar abundances within the
five plant families most commonly utilized by butterfly
larvae (Table 2) (MANOVA treatment F 5 5.9, p 5 0.151).
One year after treatment, family abundances showed a
significant difference between treatments (Table 2) (2000
MANOVA treatment F 5 12.3, p 5 0.077), but post hoc tests
revealed no significant differences amongst the five plant
families tested. Two years after treatment, total family
abundances showed no differences between treatments
(Table 2) (2001 MANOVA treatment F 5 2.4, p 5 0.320).
The only plant family with trends towards differences
between restoration treatments and control forest was
the Chenopodiaceae (data not shown in Table 2). This
plant family contained several native and non-native
annuals, such as lambsquarters (Chenopodium album),
which was ubiquitous in the seed bank (Springer 1999).
This species was not utilized by any of the common but-
terflies found in the study area.
Tree species composition was highly variable among
the five blocks but showed no significant differences
between control and treatment units before restoration.
After
restoration,
Quercus
gambelii
appeared to
be
reduced in restoration treatments (Table 2). However,
neither Q. gambelii nor Robinia neomexicana showed sig-
nificant differences between restoration treatment units
and control units. The large variability observed in tree
and understory plant composition across the four blocks
(Waltz et al. 2001) may explain the lack of significant plant
response patterns between restoration treatment and con-
trol units.
The second mechanistic question addressed was: did
nectar resource availability differ between restored and
control units? Nectar resource availability was not directly
measured in the pre-treatment years, 1997 and 1998. How-
ever, understory data sampling in these years showed no
significant differences in plant species richness between
treatments within blocks (Waltz et al. 2001) (Table 2).
After restoration treatments, flowering plants were speci-
fically examined in experimental blocks. Flowering species
richness and abundance showed no differences 1 or 2 years
after treatment (Fig. 5a) (species richness Repeated Meas-
ures, treatment year F 5 1.434, p 5 0.276) (Fig. 5b) (species
abundance Repeated Measures, treatment year F 5 0.124,
p 5 0.736). Although mean flowering plant richness and
abundance were higher in the treated areas, there was
high variance in both the treatment and control units and
much variation between treatment years. This reflected
the patchiness of understory growth in the control and
understory recovery in the treated areas as well as the
yearly precipitation differences between 2000 and 2001.
To address an alternative mechanism of adult butterfly
assemblage response to restoration treatments, we asked a
final mechanistic question: how did insolation differ
between restoration treatment units and control units?
Insolation showed no differences between treatments
before restoration (Fig. 6a) (2-way
ANOVA treatment
F 5 1.427,
p 5 0.248)
but
was
significantly
higher
in
restoration treatment units than control units after restor-
ation
treatments
(Fig. 6b)
(2-way
ANOVA
treatment
F 5 26.7, p < 0.001), with no significant treatment–time
class interaction. Directly related to canopy cover, this
measurement reflects the increased solar radiation due to
partial canopy removal.
Discussion
These results showed that butterflies responded quickly to
habitat changes as a result of restoration experiments, and
we suggest that butterfly monitoring would be a useful
addition in restoration-monitoring schemes. We showed
that the butterfly community had up to two times more
species and three to five times greater abundance in
restoration treatments when compared with paired control
forests. Not only did the number of species and individuals
increase but also community composition changes were

reflected by community-level analysis, with significant
spatial separation of restoration treatment units and con-
trol
units
based
on
butterfly
assemblages.
We
also
observed that low abundance species were censused more
often in restoration treatment units than in control units
(Table 1). The fast response of the butterfly assemblage to
these thinning and burning treatments (within one season
after treatment) suggests multiple mechanisms operating
at different scales were affecting adult butterfly distribu-
tion.
Hypotheses Tests:
These results showed an immediate
increase in butterfly richness and abundance 1 year after
restoration treatments and therefore do not support the
first hypothesis that butterfly species richness and abun-
dance would initially decline due to logging and burning
treatments. Twelve of 36 butterfly species showed greater
abundances in the restoration treatment units. This differs
from other studies showing negative lepidopteran response
to logging and fragmentation (Hill et al. 1995; Spitzer et al.
1997). However, in these ponderosa pine restoration treat-
ments, stands are thinned to resemble the forest density
hypothesized to be characteristic of forests before Euro-
American settlement (Covington et al. 1997). The butterfly
assemblage is native, and in all likelihood, individual spe-
cies are adapted to more open forests. In this context, it is
not surprising that butterfly species richness and abun-
dance increased after thinning and burning treatments.
Similarly, other systems showed lower butterfly richness
with higher overstory canopy and denser stands, associated
with decreasing understory species richness (Sparks et al.
1996). The habitat disruption and change in ponderosa
pine forests that potentially adversely affected these but-
terfly species happened 80–120 years ago, when grazing
eliminated the understory, fires were halted, and ponder-
osa pine trees irrupted (Covington & Moore 1994). Pon-
derosa pine forests today show much lower herbaceous
diversity and abundance than historical and undisturbed
forests. The thinning associated with ponderosa pine
restoration resulted in increased biodiversity and produc-
tion in understory primary producers at other sites
(Covington et al. 1997), which suggests that corresponding
increases in common herbivores are also likely.
Examination of butterfly assemblage results in control
and treatment units (Table 1) does not support the second
hypothesis that generalists would dominate the early suc-
cessional butterfly assemblage, which was supported by
studies
in
abandoned
agricultural
fields
(Erhardt
&
Thomas 1991; Steffan-Dewenter & Tscharntke 1997).
These studies showed that early successional plants corre-
lated with a more generalist butterfly assemblage. In fact,
Figure 5. Nectar plant resources showed no significant differences 1 year
or 2 years post-treatment. (a) Flowering plant species richness per 1 m2

in ponderosa pine restoration treatment units, no new
generalist species were observed after restoration treat-
ments,
although
generalist
species
V.
cardui,
Colias
eurytheme, and two Pieris sp. dominated control forest
unit butterfly assemblages. However, in the treated units,
these generalist species were outnumbered by lycaenid
species, which have much higher host plant fidelity. For
example, Plebejus icariodes and Glaucopsyche lygdamus
were two of the most common butterflies in treatment
units, and at this site, their larvae were most likely feeding
on silvery lupine (Lupinus argenteus).
Potential Mechanisms
Host plant availability, nectar resources, and abiotic vari-
ables all have the ability to affect adult butterfly distribu-
tion. In this study, the plant community showed no
significant differences between restoration treatment and
control units 2 years after treatment. We know that sus-
tainable butterfly habitat must include sufficient larval and
adult food resources (Pollard 1991), but our sampling and
analyses did not find significant changes in potential host
plant abundances. However, 12 of the 27 butterfly species
found in treatment units were local species, with limited
adult dispersal (Scott 1984), suggesting that host plants
were found locally.
Nectar resources are important in determining adult
butterfly oviposition selections; studies show host plants
are utilized only when sufficient adult resources (nectar)
are
also
available
(Murphy
1983;
Grossmueller
&
Lederhouse 1987). Although nectar resource is undeniably
an important component for adult butterfly distributions,
our early post-treatment data suggest that it is not the
main contributing factor to adult butterfly distributions in
this study. Butterflies were very fast to respond to habitat
changes and showed increases in the restoration treatment
units 1 year after treatment; however, the nectar resources
did not differ significantly between restoration treatment
units and control units even 2 years post-treatment. These
results support other studies showing that the responses of
vegetation to restoration in arid ecosystems are typically
slow (Aronson et al. 1993).
The only mechanism of adult butterfly distribution we
measured, which showed significant differences between
restoration treatment units and control units, was insola-
tion, which increased significantly in treatments as soon as
the canopy was thinned. Solar radiation has been shown to
determine butterfly minimum and maximum flight condi-
tions (Douwes 1976) as well as flight duration (Shreve
1984). Time to flight in the morning and duration of flight
during the day can have implications for butterfly disper-
sal, life span, and reproductive success (Tsuji et al. 1986).
Our data showed that although host plant and flowering
plant resources did not differ between control and restor-
ation treatment units, more butterflies were found in areas
with the highest light intensity.
Problems/Confounding factors
A valid concern in ponderosa pine restoration remains that
not all butterfly species will respond positively to restor-
ation treatments. Although it appears that ponderosa pine
restoration has large positive effects on butterfly commu-
nities, burning can also have negative effects on butterflies
by damaging larval or pupal stages (Pickering 1997). Sev-
eral studies support the concept that burning at the natural
intensity and at the natural season in a system that has
evolved with fire will not be harmful to the native organ-
isms (Collett 1998; Panzer & Schwartz 2000). An acknow-
ledged concern with ponderosa pine forest restoration
projects is that current fuel loadings do not resemble his-
toric or reference site fuel loadings, and therefore the
burning cannot take place in the ‘‘natural season.’’ Instead
of fires in the mid-summer drought that periodically
burned through ponderosa pine forests before Euro-
American settlement, initial burns after restoration thin-
ning are usually started under cooler prescriptions. For
example, these fires either follow fall rains, when air tem-
peratures are low, or take place in the spring, after the
snow melts. At these times, insects are in dormant life
stages and are more susceptible to mortality by burning.
Comparisons with reference old growth stands are also
necessary to understand the reference butterfly commu-
nity composition and accurately address restoration goals.
At Mt. Trumbull, Lycaenids (‘‘blue’’ butterflies) are read-
ily found in treated habitats, probably due to the abun-
dances of their early successional host plants (legumes)
and available nectar. However, butterfly larvae utilizing
grasses as hosts (e.g., Cercyonis sp.) are uncommon at the
Mt. Trumbull site. These species were very common at
nearby ‘‘reference’’ sites that still maintained frequent
fire regimes and subsequently a grass-dominated under-
story (Waltz, unpublished data). The return of Cercyonis
sp. to the Trumbull restoration treatments may indicate a
shift from early successional legumes and other forbs to a
grass-dominated understory.
Implications and Future Studies
Restoration of ponderosa pine forests contributed to
increases in butterfly abundances. This suggests that inver-
tebrate fauna will recolonize restored habitat. However,
continued monitoring of this taxa in response to ponderosa
pine restoration is important for the conservation of but-
terflies. Rare species were not examined in this study but
are often the most affected by drastic habitat changes
(Meffe & Carroll 1997). For example, the pine elfin,
Callophrys eryphon, was observed only once in 4 years of
sampling in the Mt. Trumbull forest (Waltz, personal
observation). The caterpillar of this species feeds on pon-
derosa pine, and the adults feed on plant nectar (Scott
1984). Little is known concerning the specific habitat
requirements of this species and how restoration treat-
ments that reduce the larval hostplant, but potentially
increase adult food resources, will affect the species.
Restoration Treatments Increase Butterflies

Other adult butterfly species do not rely on nectar food
sources and may require forested habitat. An earlier study
(Waltz & Covington 1999) showed decreases in the
Arizona Sister (Limenitis bredowii) after restoration treat-
ments. This species’ caterpillar hosts on Gambel oak, and
adults use tree sap for nourishment. Gambel oak is not
thinned with the restoration treatment, but mortality does
occur with prescribed fire. Future studies should examine
how oak response to restoration treatments affect the
larval success of this butterfly.
The literature suggests that butterflies may be good
indicators of herbaceous communities, but our results do
not support butterflies as potential indicators of the
understory
community
in
ponderosa
pine
forests.
Although butterfly communities changed quickly after
restoration treatments, no significant detectable change
occurred in either host plant frequency or nectar plant
abundance. Butterflies could be useful indicators of other
herbivorous insects (Brown 1991) or even other taxonomic
groups (Wilcox et al. 1986).
To further examine butterfly population responses to
restoration treatments, reproductive success and host
plant usage should also be documented. Our current
design
monitored
only
adult
butterfly
populations.
Although some studies have shown positive correlations
between adult butterfly densities and larval densities
(Steffan-Dewenter & Tscharntke 1997), knowledge of larval
fitness would be imperative to determine habitat quality. Of
all 37 species recorded in the Mt. Trumbull experimental
blocks, 20 were classified as locally distributed and not
found far from their host plants as adults. The other 17
were classified as migratory, although their migratory dis-
tances range from 1 km (Leptotes marina) to thousands of
kilometers (Danaus plexippus). Although migratory adults
are moving to sites with suitable host plants, they can easily
be surveyed in areas that are not suitable for maintaining
their larval population.
Finally, this study documents butterfly response only 1
and 2 years after restoration treatments, but butterfly com-
munities may continue to show compositional changes
with successional changes in the plant community (Erhardt
1985). In particular, the establishment of rare species may
occur with more established understory.
