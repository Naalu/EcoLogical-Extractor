Abstract
The Community Assembly by Trait Selection (CATS) model of community assembly pre-
dicts species abundances along environmental gradients in relatively undisturbed vegeta-
tion. Here we ask whether this model, when calibrated with data from natural plant
communities, can predict the abundances of five dominant grass species (Bouteloua graci-
lis, Elymus elymoides, Festuca arizonica, Muhlenbergia montana, and Poa fendleriana) in a
greenhouse experiment that manipulated light and soil properties. To address this question,
we used generalized additive models (GAMs) to model community-weighted mean (CWM)
seed mass, mean Julian flowering date, and specific root length (SRL) as non-linear func-
tions of two environmental variables (soil pH and pine basal area) in natural vegetation. The
model-fitted CWM traits were then used as constraints in the CATS model to predict the rel-
ative abundance of the five grass species that were seeded in a mixture at equal densities
into a 2×2 factorial experiment with soil parent material and light level as crossed factors.
Light was the most important factor influencing seedling community composition, especially
the abundances of Bouteloua gracilis and Poa fendleriana. The model-predicted relative
abundances were significantly correlated with the observed relative abundances, and the
model accurately predicted the dominant species in every treatment. P. fendleriana was cor-
rectly predicted to be the most abundant species in both shade treatments and the sun-
basalt treatment, and B. gracilis was correctly predicted to be the most abundant species in
the sun-limestone treatment. Our results provide experimental evidence that environmental
filtering of the species pool occurs in the early stages of community assembly (including ger-
mination, emergence, and early growth), and that trait-based models calibrated with data
from natural plant communities can be used to predict the outcome of the early stages of
community assembly under experimental conditions.
Introduction
Trait-based models of community assembly by environmental filtering assume that species
with functional trait values that confer the highest probability of survival, growth, and repro-
duction in a given environment will be the dominant species in that environment [1–3].

Determining how trait values vary along environmental gradients is fundamental to develop-
ing our understanding of trait-based community assembly [4]; however, the generality of
using trait-environment relationships to predict community composition has not been thor-
oughly assessed. In this paper, we test whether the predictions of a trait-based model of com-
munity assembly calibrated in natural vegetation can accurately predict the abundances of five
dominant grasses under experimental conditions.
The theory of ‘community assembly by trait selection’ (CATS) was translated into a mathe-
matical model by Shipley et al. (2006)[5]. The objective of the CATS model is to find the distri-
bution of species relative abundances (pi) that satisfies the equality constraint: PS
i¼1piti ¼ T,
where ti represents a vector of species trait values, and T represents a community-weighted
mean (CWM) trait. T represents the trait value expressed by an average individual in a com-
munity. Given that species possessing these trait values will be more abundant, a CWM trait
will be biased towards trait values conferring higher fitness [5] A thorough description of the
CATS model can be found in Shipley et al. 2006 [5].
Following its formulation, the CATS model has been evaluated in a variety of vegetation
types [6]. Although the majority of studies have focused primarily on model performance and
assessing limitations [5,7–10], application of the CATS model has been extended to forecast
shifts in species distributions under climate change and to understand the relative importance
of traits during community assembly [11–13]. These applications of the CATS model provide
compelling evidence of trait-based environmental filtering in natural plant communities.
However, most of these studies did not cross-validate the model predictions in other sites that
were independent from model calibration [14]. Laughlin et al. (2011)[11] used a data-splitting
approach where half of the data were used to fit trait-environment regression models, and
independent predictions of community composition were made on the other half of the data;
however, these predictions were not made in different spatial scales [15] or in controlled exper-
imental conditions.
In addition to lacking independent experimental confirmation of model predictions, previ-
ous tests of the CATS model have generally focused on predicting the composition of naturally
established vegetation. This approach assumes that distributions of functional traits along the
environmental gradients at a single point in time provide adequate information about the
dynamics of environmental filtering. However, environmental filtering of the species pool can
occur during the germination-phase (i.e., radicle emergence from a seed), the emergence-
phase (i.e., emergence of seedling from the soil), and the early growth phase (i.e. growth of
seedling during first few weeks), when individual plants experience the conditions of the envi-
ronment for the first time. We acknowledge that species differ strongly in their requirements
to break dormancy to trigger germination, but our study does not address these differences
directly. Species are also known to exhibit strong differences in their germination and emer-
gence requirements [16]. Germination and emergence response are known to be influenced
by both light quality (i.e., red: far-red ratio) and quantity (i.e., photosynthetic active radiation,
PAR) [17]. Higher red: far-red ratios can trigger positive germination and emergence
responses in light-demanding species [18], and yet greater germination and emergence rates
have also been found for species exposed to lower PAR [6]. Soil water content can also influ-
ence rates of germination and emergence among species [8].
To the best of our knowledge, the predictions of the CATS model have not been tested at
the early yet critical phases of germination, emergence, and early growth under differing envi-
ronmental conditions. Can the CATS model, when calibrated with data from established natu-
ral vegetation; predict the relative abundance of dominant species in an experiment that
manipulates light and soil properties? Here we quantify the environmental filters using trait-

environment relationships observed in natural ponderosa pine forest communities of northern
Arizona [10]. We then apply the CATS model in a controlled greenhouse experiment and pre-
dict the relative abundances of five grass species under controlled conditions where light and
soil properties were manipulated in a crossed 2×2 factorial experiment (S1 Appendix).
Materials and methods
Model development: Vegetation samples, plant traits, and environmental
conditions
We began by developing models to describe variation in CWM trait values as functions of
environmental gradients. CWM trait values were calculated from field data, which consisted of
herbaceous plant communities occupying a series of 96 permanent 1 m2 quadrats located
across a 700 km2 landscape surrounding Flagstaff, Arizona, USA. These quadrats are distrib-
uted within a ponderosa pine forest ecosystem between the elevations of 2000–2500 m and
span a range of soil parent material developed from basalt and limestone parent material.
Dense stands of ponderosa pine are interspersed with fragmented patches of grass-dominated
openings. The understory herbaceous plant community, dominated by C3 and C4 perennial
bunchgrasses followed by perennial, annual and biennial forbs, is an integral component of
this ponderosa pine forest and is the major source of plant diversity [19].
We used three functional traits measured on all 79 herbaceous species found on the quad-
rats, including seed mass, specific root length (SRL) and mean Julian flowering date (flowering
date) (S3 Appendix)[20]. Average trait values were obtained for each species using standard-
ized methods as described in S4 Appendix. To determine the relationship between functional
traits and environmental conditions in natural vegetation, we calculated community-weighted
mean (CWM) trait values (i.e., T ¼ PS
i¼1piti, where pi are relative abundances and ti are trait
values of species i) for each functional trait. Observed relative abundances (i.e. pi) were calcu-
lated using visual estimates of foliar cover for all species in each of the ninety-six 1 m2 quadrats
using standard vegetation sampling techniques [21]. Quadrats were visually divided into 1%
squares and professional botanists estimated the total number of 1% squares occupied by each
species. Relative abundance of each species in a quadrat were calculated by dividing the per-
cent of each species by the total percent cover of the quadrat. Visual estimates were made dur-
ing a two-month period between August and September of 2011. We chose to analyze three
traits measured on three different plant organs (seeds, flowers, and roots) because including
multiple traits from multiple organs has been shown to improve trait-based predictions of
community composition [7].
Seed mass is the oven-dry mass of an average seed of a species expressed in mg [22]. Seed
mass reflects a fundamental tradeoff between seed size and reproductive output. Larger seeded
species produce fewer seeds for a given reproductive effort, yet seedlings have more reserves to
establish in low-resource environments [23]. This is an important characteristic as well
because in dense shade larger seeds are expected to contribute to longer survival during the
cotyledon stage owing to greater metabolic reserves [24].
SRL is the ratio of fine root (< 2mm diameter) length to dry mass expressed as m g-1 and
reflects foraging potential relative to carbon investment [22]. SRL has been shown to be posi-
tively correlated with relative growth rate [25] and with higher rates of nutrient acquisition
[26].
Flowering date reflects the mean Julian date that a species flowers and was determined for
each species using regional floras [20]. Flowering date represents a species’ life history strategy
related to phenological timing of germination and emergence, reproduction, and growth
[27,28]. Germination and emergence responses are largely regulated by expression of the

flowering time gene Flowering Locus C (FLC) [29,30]. C3 grasses generally have earlier flower-
ing dates than C4 grasses in this ponderosa pine bunchgrass ecosystem. Using flowering date
as opposed to the C4 and C3 trait explicitly, better represents the variability that exists between
these species in terms of phenology.
We used values of soil pH and pine basal area measured at each of the 96 quadrats. Pine
basal area represents the cross-sectional area of ponderosa pine trees within a given area,
expressed as m2 ha-1. It was measured in a 20 × 20 m plot centered on each quadrat as
described in Laughlin 2011 [30]. Soil pH was measured at each quadrat between July and
August as described in Laughlin et al. (2011) [31]. Soil pH and pine basal area are two environ-
mental variables that have been shown to be good predictors of plant community composition
[32] and trait distributions [10,30]) in this ponderosa pine-bunchgrass vegetation. Soil pH has
important implications for community composition through its influence on nutrient avail-
ability and species-specific tolerances to acidic or basic conditions [33]. Pine basal area impacts
community composition directly by altering light availability to the forest floor [34], through
belowground competition for soil moisture [35], and indirectly through litter fall of recalci-
trant needles, decreasing soil pH and altering the availability of nutrients in the mineral soil
[31].
Generalized additive models (GAMs) were developed using soil pH and pine basal area to
model the variation in each of the three CWM traits (seed mass, SRL, and flowering date)
across the 96 quadrats. GAMs were fit with a Gaussian error distribution and a maximum
smoothing value of 10 using the ‘gam’ function in the ‘mgcv’ library of R [36].
Greenhouse experiment
The experiment was conducted over a three-month period (August–November 2011) in the
Greenhouse Research Complex at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, USA.
We focus on the five most abundant grass species found across our quadrats, including two C4
grass species (Bouteloua gracilis (Wild. Ex Kunth) Lag. Ex Griffiths, and Muhlenbergia mon-
tana (Nutt.) Hitchc.) and three C3 grass species (Elymus elymoides (Raf.) Swezey, Festuca arizo-
nica (Vasey), and Poa fendleriana (Steud) Vasey). These species represent the broad spectrum
of functional trait variation that exists among native grass species in this ecosystem (S2 Appen-
dix). We chose to test the model using the these five species for two reasons: 1) These grasses
dominate the understory, contributing approximately 70% of the total biomass of herbaceous
plants in this ecosystem (21). These species are of particular interest to managers because they
represent an important forage base for livestock and wildlife and are integral to the high fre-
quency, low intensity surface fires characteristic of these ponderosa pine forests [37,38].
We established a 2 × 2 factorial study with soil parent material and light level as crossed fac-
tors. Soils derived from limestone and basalt substrates were chosen because they reflect signif-
icant differences in soil pH across our study site. Limestone and basalt-derived soils were
collected from two sites on the Coconino National Forest near Flagstaff, Arizona. All soils
were double sterilized prior to use in a 0.19 cubic meter electric sterilizer. Forty 3.78-liter pots
were filled with sterilized limestone-derived soil and 40 one-gallon pots were filled with steril-
ized basalt-derived soil.
Pine basal area is an important driver of light gradients in our system. Two contrasting
light levels were chosen to reflect the lowest and highest pine basal area found across our
study; light quantity in full sun where pine basal area is zero m2 ha-1 and dense shade where
pine basal area is 59 m2 ha-1. While light levels were used as surrogates for pine basal area in
our experiment, values of pine basal area were used to make CATS model predictions
(described below). To replicate light conditions in the greenhouse we made comparisons of

light conditions between the field and greenhouse, a Sunfleck Ceptometer (Decagon, Pullman,
WA), was used to measure photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD: 400–700 nm), which
indicates the amount of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) falling on a given surface.
These measurements were made on cloud free days, between 11:00 and 14:00 Mountain stan-
dard time at approximately 30 cm above the ground during July-August of 2011. Average
PPFD in full sun corresponded to an average of 2149 μmol m-2 s-1, while deep shade average
74.8 μmol m-2 s-1. For our shade treatment we used stock shade cloth designed to block out
50% of available light. This resulted in an average daily PPFD on the shade treatments of
83.4 μmol m-2 s-1, approximating the value of 74.8 μmol m-2 s-1 under deep shade. Full sun
treatments had an average greenhouse PPFD of 909 μmol m-2 s-1. This reduction can be attrib-
uted to the greenhouse glass and corresponds to approximately 30 m2 ha-1 pine basal area.
Shade treatments were applied to half of the pots for each parent material; the shade cloth
was hung approximately one meter above the pots. The remaining pots were placed in full
light. Twelve seeds of each species were raked into the soil of each pot; this resulted in an aver-
age sowing density of 0.13 seeds cm-2 (1,300 seeds m-2), which is comparable to average seed-
ing densities found in open canopy forests in this ecosystem [39]. Given the equal sowing
densities for each species, no species was seed or dispersal limited in this experiment. Pots
were randomly arranged on the greenhouse benches and were watered equally once daily. No
pots received fertilizer treatments, and weeds were removed daily. Throughout the duration of
the study no germination-emergence was observed in three communities in each light treat-
ment containing limestone soil and four communities in each light treatment containing basalt
soil, so we removed these pots from the analysis. This left a total of 66 pots in the analysis; 17
in both sun and shaded limestone treatments and 16 in each sun and shaded basalt treatments.
We tracked the germination-emergence and survival of all individuals of each species in every
pot once every two weeks for the duration of the project, which lasted 80 days. Final counts
were used to calculate species relative abundances by density, which were then used to test the
model.
Model predictions
GAMs developed from field data (described in Model development section above) were used to
make predictions of optimal CWM trait values under greenhouse conditions. To make predic-
tions we used values of soil pH and pine basal area collected from across our 96 quadrats
[30,31]. For limestone soils we used mean values of 6.8 for soil pH and for basalt soils we used
mean values of 5.9 for soil pH. For pine basal area we used zero m2 ha-1 to represent our ‘sun’
treatment and 59 m2 ha-1 to represent our ‘shade’ treatment. We chose to use zero m2 ha-1
instead of the 30 m2 ha-1 because this approach is most consistent with how we designed the
study and zero m2 ha-1 yielded better predictions.
Predictions of CWM trait values were then used as constraints in the CATS model to pre-
dict the relative abundance of each of the five grass species in the experimental communities.
Predictions for CWM traits in each treatment are summarized in S5 Appendix.
The predictions of relative abundances used all three CWM traits simultaneously. Given
that there were fewer constraints than species, this system of linear equations will have many
possible solutions. The CATS model chooses the probability distribution (i.e., distribution of
relative abundances, pi) that maximizes the entropy function,  PS
i¼1pilnpi (i.e., the distribu-
tion is maximally even subject to the linear constraints). The constraints are the CWM traits
(T) are constants that constrain the solutions of species abundances. Therefore, we obtained
predictions of relative abundance for each of the five species in each of the four (2 × 2) treat-
ment combinations.

Statistical analysis
We examined the main effects of light and soil parent material, and the light × soil interaction
effect on resulting community composition and observed CWM traits. We used a two-way fac-
torial permutation-based multivariate analysis of variance (PerMANOVA, [40]where Bray-
Curtis dissimilarity was used as the distance measure for multivariate data (community com-
position) [41]. The Euclidean distance measure was used for univariate data (individual spe-
cies). All analyses were performed using the ‘vegan’ library [42] of R version 3.2.2 [43].
To evaluate the predictive performance of the CATS model under experimental conditions,
we examined the degree of correlation between the observed and predicted vegetation struc-
ture and CWM traits. We compared the average observed relative abundances for each species
and CWM trait in each treatment to the predicted relative abundances and CWM trait for
each treatment combination. This resulted in a 4 × 5 “treatment × species” and 4 × 3
“treatment × CWM trait” matrix.
Model predictions were compared with observed relative abundances using two measures
of fit: R2 (using untransformed relative abundances) and the Root Mean Square Error
(RMSEsqrt) using square-root transformed relative abundances [44]. We evaluated the statisti-
cal significance of model predictions by comparing measures of fit obtained from predicted
constraints against a null distribution of 999 measures of fit obtained by permuting observed
relative abundances. Concordance between the predicted and observed relative CWM trait val-
ues was evaluated by correlation analysis with Pearson’s correlation coefficient.
Results
Model development: Vegetation samples and environmental conditions
The environmental variables explained between 15–44% of the variance of the three CWM
traits (Table 1). Soil pH and pine basal area were both significant factors for explaining varia-
tion in seed mass, SRL, and flowering date.
Treatment effects
Survival was close to 100% for most species in each treatment, however germination and emer-
gence varied greatly among species and treatments (data summarized in S6 Appendix). Light
explained a significant amount of variation in overall seedling community composition (R2 =
0.14) (Table 2). There was no significant main effect of soil parent material or light × soil par-
ent material interaction on community composition (Table 2). Light was also the only factor
that explained a significant amount of variation among species (Table 2). For B. gracilis, light
explained 30% of the variability in its relative abundance. B. gracilis was slightly more

abundant on limestone compared to basalt soils and it performed best in high light (Fig 1).
Light was a significant factor influencing the distribution and abundance of P. fendleriana and
explained 12% of the variability in its observed relative abundance. P. fendleriana was observed
to be the dominant species in shade treatments and performed slightly better on limestone par-
ent material (Fig 1B). Seedling abundances of E. elymoides, F. arizonica, or M. montana were
not influenced by any treatment (Table 2).
Light was the only factor explaining a significant amount of variability in observed CWM
trait values in the experimental communities (Table 3). Light explained 22% of the variation in
CWM SRL and 23% of the variation in CWM flowering date. No significant effect of light, par-
ent material, or their interaction was found for CWM seed mass.

ments (R2 = 0.53, P = 0.0010; RMSEsqrt = 0.25, P = 0.0045). The CATS model correctly pre-
dicted the most abundant species in each treatment (although the observed abundance of B.

gracilis was only slightly more abundant than P. fendleriana in sun-limestone treatments; 33%
vs 31% respectively), and in 72% of the experimental greenhouse communities. P. fendleriana
was correctly predicted to be the most abundant species in both shade treatments and the sun-
basalt treatment (Fig 1). B. gracilis was correctly predicted to be the most abundant species in
sun-limestone treatments. F. arizonica and B. gracilis were correctly predicted to be the second
most abundant species in shade-limestone and sun-basalt treatments, respectively (Fig 1A and
1D). The model also correctly predicted P. fendleriana to be the second most abundant species
following B. gracilis in sun-limestone treatments. F. arizonica was consistently more abundant
than E. elymoides, however the model was only able to predict this ranking in the shade-lime-
stone treatments.

between predicted CWM trait values and the observed mean CWM trait values in each treat-
ment (Fig 2). For each trait, the predicted values showed trends across light and soil condi-
tions, while no such trend is visible in the observed CWM traits. However, the model
predictions for SRL and flowering date were reasonable, for example higher CWM SRL and
later flowering dates were predicted in sun versus shade treatments (Fig 2B and 2C). Model
predictions were poorest for CWM seed mass (data can be found in S4 Appendix).
Discussion
This study examined the generality of a trait-based model by predicting the outcome of the
early phase of community assembly under experimental conditions. Using seed, root, and
flowering traits, the CATS model, calibrated in natural communities predicted different abun-
dances of common grass species among the different treatment combinations of light and soil
parent material. Our results have two main implications for vegetation science. First, environ-
mental filtering is an important process in the early stages of community assembly, but light
exhibited stronger effects on the germination, emergence, and early growth phases than soil
parent material. Second, the trait-based CATS model can produce predictions that are signifi-
cantly correlated with observations under experimental conditions that are independent from
the locations in which the model was calibrated, but accuracy varied among species and treat-
ment combinations.
Environmental filters on germination, emergence, and early growth
On small spatial scales, where species are not limited by dispersal, the community assembly
process reflects the influence of environmental filters and biotic interactions [45]. While many
important processes control the assembly of species (i.e., dispersal limitation, demographic
stochasticity, positive and negative species interactions, disturbance), this study isolated the
early stages of germination, emergence, and early growth while eliminating the possibility of
dispersal limitation. Nearly 100% of the individual seedlings that germinated survived until the
end of the experiment. Yet species differed strongly in their germination and emergence rates,
indicating that the environmental conditions affecting seed germination and emergence were
important filters influencing the assembly of the experimental communities.

A substantial amount of research documents the importance of light in the germination
and emergence phases of plant development. The primary mechanism relates to how plants
respond to changes in the spectral ratio of red and far-red light [46,47]. This mechanism has
been shown to be more important for smaller seeded species suggesting an increased sensitiv-
ity to microsite availability related to shading and competition [18,47,48]. This likely relates to
an increased risk of mortality for smaller seeded species compared to larger seeded species
when subject to post germination hazards and the need to optimize resource acquisition [49].
Light was not a significant factor for the larger seeded species in our study, E. elymoides and F.
arizonica, suggesting a capacity to utilize seed reserves that allowed them to occupy a wider
range of microsites as well as buffer post-germination hazards. Previous research also docu-
ments that this response is species-specific, which agrees with our findings [50]. For example,

treatments based on light level and parent material; shade-basalt (green), shade-limestone (red), sun-basalt (blue), and sun-limestone (purple). Pearson’s correlation
coefficients are given. No significant (ns) correlations between observed and predicted CWM trait values were found.

while both P. fendleriana, and B. gracilis have small seeds and showed a significant response to
the light treatment in our experiment, M. montana, the species with the smallest seed mass did
not. Furthermore, the experimental treatments had no significant effect on observed CWM
seed mass, indicating that seed mass does not have clear predictable effects on germination,
emergence, and early growth across the range of environmental conditions studied here.
Full sun treatments reflect high resource environments, which have been shown to select
for species that tend to have high SRL and later flowering dates [25]. We expected the two C4
species (i.e. B. gracilis and M. montana), which have high SRL and a late flowering to perform
best in sun treatments because at higher temperatures and greater light intensities SRL would
allow for a more rapid acquisition of nutrients and a later flowering date is associated with spe-
cies better adapted to persist in warmer, high light conditions [30,33]. Yet, only B. gracilis per-
formed well in our full sun treatments. In addition, P. fendleriana, a C3 species with low SRL,
and an early flowering date performed nearly as well as B. gracilis in these treatments, suggest-
ing that in high resource environments these traits do not necessarily confer a competitive
advantage during early stages of community assembly. In contrast, shade treatments reflect
resource-poor environments, so species with traits that confer an ability to tolerate low light
levels would be expected to be dominant [51,52]. Our findings were more consistent with this.
For example, all three C3 species (E. elymoides, F. arizonica, and P. fendleriana), with relatively
low SRL and early flowering dates performed best in shade treatments. Decreases in light avail-
ability associated with increased ponderosa pine density has been correlated with a shift in
understory community composition towards species exhibiting whole-plant shade tolerant
strategies associated with low SRL and earlier flowering times [32].
Flowering date relates to the phenology of life history events and exhibits pleiotropy with
germination and emergence in some species [36,53]. Specifically, the major flowering time
gene Flowering Locus C (FLC) has been shown to regulate temperature dependent germina-
tion and emergence [36]. Flowering date differs most between the C3 and C4 species in our
study and all three C3 species tended to be more abundant in shaded treatments. While we do
not not know the degree of FLC expression among these species it suggests a possible mecha-
nism for this finding. Earlier germination and emergence can also provide a competitive
advantage, enabling plants to reach a larger size before reproduction, thereby increasing fecun-
dity [54]).
Model predictions
Predicted and observed CWM trait values were not significantly correlated. We did observe
general agreement in at least one treatment for each trait. For example, there was general
agreement between predicted and observed CWM seed mass in shade-limestone and sun-
basalt, but not shade-basalt or sun-limestone. There was also general agreement between
observed and predicted CWM SRL in sun-basal and sun-limestone and for flowering date in
sun-basalt treatments. Higher CWM SRL and flowering dates in sun versus shade is also con-
sistent with the trait-environment relationships shown in the fitted GAMs, which reflect the
observed trait distributions in the natural plant communities. This is important because the
CATS model, despite the imperfect prediction of CWM traits in the experiment, still yielded
reasonable predictions of species relative abundances. In this case, the agreement found
between observed and predicted CWM trait values in at least one treatment for each trait com-
pensated for poorer CWM trait predictions elsewhere and their influence on CATS model pre-
dictions of relative abundances.
Predictive accuracy can also be attributed to several factors related to CATS model con-
straints and the experimental environment. Similarity in trait values among species in a given

community has been shown to decrease the predictive accuracy of the CATS model [8].
Greater similarity in trait values can increase the number of feasible solutions to the system of
linear equations, so there would be a larger set of distributions that agree with the constraints.
While these species represent a broad range of trait values among grass species in this ecosys-
tem, their range of traits with respect to other understory species (e.g., legumes, annual forbs,
etc.) is restricted. Also, our measure of relative abundances based on density might be suffi-
ciently distinct from the visual estimates of cover that were used to calibrate the trait-environ-
ment relationships to impact CATS model predictions. It cannot be overlooked that the CWM
traits used as constraints to predict the relative abundance of our five grass species were pre-
dicted from field data. So, while we assume that similar traits will manifest in similar environ-
ments, differences in soil pH and light availability across each of our experimental
communities likely represented sufficiently different environments from those natural com-
munities in which CWM traits were estimated. Measuring soil pH in each experimental com-
munity might have allowed for more precise predictions, rather than using mean values that
were calculated from field data throughout the region.
The validity of any scientific theory rests in its ability to make accurate and generalizable
predictions [55]. By providing quantitative predictions of the relative abundances of individual
species in a community, the CATS model can be used to directly test the theoretical framework
of trait-based community assembly through environmental filtering. Our results provide evi-
dence that environmental filtering and species sorting occurs in the phases of germination,
emergence, and early growth, and that trait-based models can predict the outcome of these
early stages of community assembly under experimental conditions. Additional experimental
studies will be useful for examining the predictive ability of trait-based models using more
functionally diverse communities at various spatial and temporal scales.
