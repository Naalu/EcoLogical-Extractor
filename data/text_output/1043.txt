Abstract: Exclusion of natural surface ﬁres in warm/dry mixed-conifer forests of the western U.S.
has increased potential for stand-replacing crown ﬁres and reduced resilience of these systems to
other disturbances, such as drought and insect attack. Tree thinning and the application of prescribed
ﬁre are commonly used to restore more resilient ecological conditions, but currently, there is a lack
of long-term data with which to evaluate restoration treatment eﬀectiveness in forest types where
resprouting shrubs dominate understory communities. At a mixed-conifer site in southwestern
Colorado, we compared forest structure and understory vegetation responses to three restoration
treatments (thin/burn, burn, and control) over 10 years in a completely randomized and replicated
experiment. Forest density, canopy cover, and crown fuel loads were consistently lower, and crown
base height was higher, in thin/burn than burn or controls, but the eﬀects diminished over time.
Ten years following treatment, >99% of all plant species within both treatments and the control were
native in origin. There were no diﬀerences between treatments in understory richness, diversity, cover,
or surface fuels, but graminoid cover more than doubled in all treatments over the 15-year monitoring
period. Similarly, there was more than a 250% increase post-treatment in shrub density, with the
greatest increases in the thin/burn treatment. In addition, we saw an increase in the average shrub
height for both treatments and the control, with shrub stems >80 cm becoming the dominant size class
in the thin/burn treatment. Conifer seedling density was signiﬁcantly lower in thin/burn compared
with burn and control treatments after 10 years. Taken together, these conditions create challenges
for managers aiming to reestablish natural ﬁre patterns and sustain mixed-conifer forests. To limit
the dominance of resprouting shrubs and facilitate conifer regeneration after overstory thinning
and prescribed ﬁre, managers may need to consider new or more intensive approaches to forest
restoration, particularly given current and projected climate change.

1. Introduction
Mixed-conifer forests in the southwest occur along a continuum from warm/dry to cool/mesic [1].
Warm/dry mixed-conifer forests are dominated by ﬁre-resistant species, such as ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson) and Douglas ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco)), but also
include mesic species, such as white ﬁr (Abies concolor (Gord. & Glend.) Lindl. ex Hildebr.) and

aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.). This forest type is located at elevations (2250–3000 m) just above
ponderosa pine forests. Over the last few decades, there has been an increase in wildﬁre size and
behavior in dry mixed-conifer forest types across the western United States, with a shift towards
uncharacteristically large (>1000 ha) stand-replacing crown ﬁres [2,3]. Frequent surface ﬁres are an
important aspect of natural disturbance regimes in dry mixed-conifer systems, and stand-replacing
crown ﬁres are not the norm [4]. In southwestern Colorado, understory and midstory communities are
variable but can be dominated by persistent resprouting shrubs and hardwood trees, such as Gambel
oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.), serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia (Nutt.) Nutt. ex M. Roemer), and
snowberry (Symphoricarpus rotundifolius Gray).
Prior to Euro-American settlement, dry mixed-conifer forests primarily burned as low to moderate
severity surface ﬁres but also experienced mixed severity ﬁres that included surface, torching, and
crowning depending on the topography, fuels, and climate, with mean ﬁre return intervals (MFIs) of
2–32 years [5–7]. Dry mixed-conifer forests were historically heterogeneous in structure due to diverse
ﬁre behavior, which promoted ecological resilience and understory species diversity [8]. Due to the
past management activities of ﬁre suppression, logging, and grazing, dry mixed-conifer forests are
increasingly homogeneous with higher fuel loads, and the composition shifted toward shade-tolerant
and ﬁre-intolerant species [9–11]. Climatic warming, drought, and forest structural changes have
resulted in decreased ecosystem resilience and increased susceptibility to stand-replacing crown
ﬁres in these as well as other dry mixed-conifer forest types across the west [4,12–14]. In response,
land managers over the past two decades have used mechanical tree thinning and prescribed ﬁre to
decrease the susceptibility of crown ﬁre and restore more characteristic forest structure, composition,
and ecological function.
Despite the widespread use of forest restoration treatments in dry forest types across the western
U.S. for the past few decades, questions remain regarding treatment eﬀects on ecosystem dynamics
due to the scarcity of long-term (≥10 years) multi-scaled studies [15]. For example, increasing native
plant diversity is one of the most cited goals for ecological restoration [16], but presently, there is a
dearth of research on how treatments aﬀect understory plant communities over the long term [17–22].
In a meta-analysis, Schwilk et al. [23] found no consistent pattern in understory community diversity
and abundance in response to forest restoration treatments. However, Abella and Springer [20] found
that understory abundance consistently increased in studies that monitored changes for ﬁve years or
longer. On sites where sprouting woody species are abundant in the understory or midstory, rapid
increases following tree thinning and ﬁre may inhibit the establishment and growth of other less
competitive species [11]. These patterns may in turn aﬀect ecosystem dynamics, particularly with
subsequent severe ﬁre [24]. Further, the eﬀects of shrub responses on the treatment longevity and when
follow-up treatments are necessary remains unclear for land managers [11,25–27]. Pretreatment stand
conditions, treatment intensity, and site productivity all aﬀect the longevity of restoration treatment
eﬀectiveness [28].
In 2002, we initiated a ﬁeld experiment to compare no treatment with two forest restoration
treatments (thinning followed by prescribed ﬁre, prescribed ﬁre only, and no treatment) commonly
applied to reduce hazardous fuels, increase understory diversity, and increase resilience to climate
and disturbance. We monitored ecological responses, 1, 5, and 10 years following treatments in dry
mixed-conifer forests of southern Colorado and asked the following questions:
(1) How do forest structure and hazardous fuels vary among the restoration treatments?
(2) How do understory plant richness, diversity, abundance, and community dynamics diﬀer
among treatments over time? and
(3) Do conditions 10 years post-treatment indicate enhanced resiliency?

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Area
Our study area is located on lower Middle Mountain in the San Juan Mountains (N 37.296,
W 107.228) on the San Juan National Forest approximately 18 km northwest of Pagosa Springs,
in southwest Colorado. Lower Middle Mountain consists of moderately steep (15%–30%) slopes on
generally south-facing aspects. Elevations range from 2438 to 2743 m. The dominant soil type is
Dutton loam, a silty clay loam [29]. Average daily temperatures range from a maximum of 28.2 ◦C in
July to a minimum of −17 ◦C in January. Average annual precipitation is 55.0 cm, with the greatest
amounts occurring in July and August. Snow dominates precipitation from November to March, with
an average annual total snowfall of 295.7 cm [30].
A large portion of the warm/dry mixed-conifer forest on Lower Middle Mountain has numerous
old-growth characteristics, which include large trees, spike-topped or broken-topped trees, snags, and
large coarse woody debris. Forest vegetation is dominated by ponderosa pine, Douglas ﬁr, and white ﬁr
interspersed with small pockets of both mature and young aspen (P. tremuloides Michx.) The midstory
and understory are dominated primarily by white ﬁr and Douglas ﬁr, with a variety of shrubs,
including Gambel oak (Q. gambelii Nutt.), snowberry, and serviceberry. Ponderosa pine regeneration
is present. Common herbaceous species at the site include blue wild rye (Elymus glaucus Buckley),
Thurber’s fescue (Festuca thurberi Vasey), Parry’s oatgrass (Danthonia parryi Scribn.), muttongrass
(Poa fendleriana (Steud.) Vasey), little sunﬂower (Helianthella quinquenervis (Hooker) Gray), tuber
starwort (Pseudostellaria jamesiana (Torrey) Weber and Hartman), and showy ﬂeabane (Erigeron speciosus
(Lindley) de Candolle).
Past disturbance history on Lower Middle Mountain includes sheep grazing beginning in the late
1800s, cattle grazing since the early 1900s, and ﬁre suppression since the early 20th century. There are
no large meadows or water hole-tanks and minimal grazing within the area. A single timber harvest
occurred between 1990 and 1993, which was the ﬁrst harvest of an intended three-harvest shelterwood
cut to manage the stand for even-aged conditions. Foresters removed 3830 million board feet, which
consisted of 51% ponderosa pine, 33% white ﬁr, and 16% Douglas ﬁr evenly across the study area [29].
2.2. Experimental Design and Field Methods
Thinning prescription was based on site-speciﬁc reconstructed historical forest structure and
retained all living trees that established in 1870 or earlier as identiﬁed by size, bark color, and canopy
architecture [6]. We also retained live post-settlement trees as substitutes for remnants (e.g., snags,
logs, and stumps) if the remnants were present in 1870 but were no longer alive. On average, we kept
two younger trees of the same species, within 20 m of each dead remnant (see Korb et al. [31] for
a detailed description of the thinning prescription). Logs or limbs were not removed following
thinning treatments in 2004, nor did we rake around old-growth trees to remove fuels around tree
boles. Fire crews did prescribe burning in fall 2007 (Blocks 1 and 2) and fall 2008 (Blocks 3 and 4)
using strip head ﬁres. Fire crews were unable to burn all units during the same time period due
to smoke output regulations. Average ﬂame lengths were 0.3–0.9 m in needle duﬀ, 1–2.4 m in the
tree thinning slash, and up to 7.6 m from torching trees, with a very low rate of spread for both
years. Post-treatment forest measurements were conducted in 2018 as described in Korb et al. [31]
and Stoddard et al. [26]. We established four replicate blocks of three randomly assigned treatment
units (~16 ha/unit): 1) Thinning followed by prescribed ﬁre (thin/burn), 2) prescribed ﬁre only (burn),
and 3) no treatment (control). We established 20 permanent monitoring plots to characterize forest
structure and vegetation on a 60-m grid based on a systematic starting grid point (total N = 4 blocks
× 3 treatment units/block × 20 plots/unit = 240 plots). Plot centers were permanently marked with
iron stakes and georeferenced with global positioning systems. We collected pre-treatment data in the
summer of 2003 and post-treatment data in the summers of 2009, 2013, and 2018. Overstory trees and
saplings taller than breast height (137 cm) were measured in a 400-m2 (11.28 m radius) circular plot.

Forests 2020, 11, 508

For each tree in every plot, we recorded species, condition (living or snag/log classes Thomas et al. [32]),
diameter at breast height (dbh), total height, and crown base height. We tallied tree regeneration for
seedlings (<40 cm in height and ≤2.5 cm DBH), saplings (>40.1 cm in height and ≤2.5 cm DBH), and
individual shrub stems by species, condition, and height class (<40 cm; 40.1–80 cm; 80.1–137 cm) on a
nested 100-m2 (5.64 m radius) subplot. Tree canopy cover was recorded using a vertical projection
densitometer every 3 m along a permanently marked 50-m line transect oriented upslope through
the plot center. Dead woody biomass and forest ﬂoor (litter and duﬀ) depth were measured on a
permanently marked 15.2-m planar transect in a random direction from each plot center [33].
We used a modiﬁcation of the modiﬁed Whittaker plot [34] to describe understory vegetation.
A 10 by 50-m belt transect was centered over each 50-m line transect. All species of herbaceous plants
and woody shrubs were recorded in the belt. We established four 1-m2 (0.5 by 2 m) subplots within
each belt transect at 14-m intervals with the 2-m side parallel with the transect. Subplots were located
in the top left (0–2 m) and bottom right (48–50 m) corners of the belt transect and on the right side of the
line transect at 16–18 m and the left side at 32–34 m. For each subplot, we estimated the percent cover of
each understory species, excluding interspaces, to the nearest 0.25% using cardboard cutouts of known
sizes as visual guides. Estimates can total >100% because we estimated percent cover independently
for each species and independent of canopy position.
2.3. Statistical Analysis
We used analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures to test for treatment eﬀects over
time on herbaceous cover (%), tree density (trees ha−1), tree canopy cover (%), crown base height (m),
shrub density (stems ha−1) (including sprouting tree species, such as Acer glabrum and P. tremuloides),
conifer regeneration (>40 cm and ≤137 cm in height; seedling ha−1), surface fuels (sum of forest ﬂoor
and 1–100-h time-lag surface fuels classes (Mg ha−1), and canopy fuel loading (kg m−2) (see Roccaforte
et al. [35] for how CFL was estimated). Depths of the forest ﬂoor were converted to estimated forest
ﬂoor loads developed from regression equations in Ffolliot et al. [36]. Prior to ANOVA, we used
Shapiro–Wilk to test for data normality, and Levene’s test to assess for equal variance. Regeneration
density was 1/× (reciprocal) transformed to meet ANOVA assumptions for normality. When we
identiﬁed time × treatment interactions, we performed one-way ANOVA tests within treatment years.
For these tests, we used Tukey’s HSD (honestly signiﬁcant diﬀerence) post-hoc tests for pairwise
comparisons of treatment group means. Changes over time from 2003 to 2018 within treatment for
individual species were tested with matched paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Species diﬀerences
among treatments were tested with a Kruskal–Wallis test and post hoc Wilcoxon’s 2-sample test for
pairwise comparisons. All tests were conducted at α = 0.05. We calculated species richness as the
number of species within a given plot and used the Shannon–Weiner diversity index, which uses
species richness and each individual species’ relative abundance, to quantify diversity [37]. Values
typically range from 1.5–3.5, rarely exceeding 4.0; a higher diversity index value indicates higher
plot diversity. The Shannon–Weiner diversity index considers all species equal and does not weigh
sensitive, endemic, keystone, or endangered species diﬀerently. As a result, Spellerberg and Fedor [37]
recommend using diversity along with another species’ measurement to more fully quantify diversity.
We used indicator-species analysis [38], which uses species richness and associated abundance values
of species, as an additional measure to identify species that were particularly faithful (i.e., consistent
indicators) for a speciﬁc forest restoration treatment. A comparison between the maximum indicator
value (0–100) and random trials for occurrence of a given species (1000 Monte Carlo randomizations)
provided an approximate alpha value [37]. Species with alpha levels of 0.05 or less and indicator values
(INDVAL) >25 (INDVAL = relative abundance relative frequency; INDVAL ranges from 0–100) were
accepted as indicator species for a speciﬁc treatment [39].
We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) to illustrate diﬀerences of the midstory plant
community (shrubs and conifer regeneration (>40 cm and ≤137 cm in height)) for each experimental
unit [40]. The NMS ordination was determined using 20 species (after 5% ﬁlter) with a 2-dimensional

Forests 2020, 11, 508

solution. We used the Bray–Curtis distance measure, random starting conﬁgurations, 500 runs with
real data, a maximum of 500 iterations per run, and a stability criterion of 0.00001. A Monte Carlo
test with 9999 randomizations was used to determine how likely the observed stress value of the ﬁnal
solution would be by chance alone. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA)
was used to quantify diﬀerences in the herbaceous understory and prostrate shrub communities among
treatments and diﬀerences in the midstory (shrubs and tree regeneration) plant communities among
treatments [41]. PERMANOVA uses common ecological distance measures (Bray–Curtis for this study)
to examine multivariate data sets and calculates alpha values using permutations rather than tabled
alpha values that assume normality. We used a one-ﬁxed-factor design with the treatment as our main
eﬀect for the herbaceous understory and prostrate shrub community analysis and a two-factor design
with treatment and time for midstory data (PC-ORD software version 5.10, McCune and Meﬀord [42]).
We analyzed species that were present in a minimum of 5% of the plots as recommended by McCune
and Grace [38].
3. Results
3.1. Pretreatment Conditions
Prior to the implementation of restoration treatments, there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences among
treatments for herbaceous understory and prostrate shrub richness (p = 0.96), diversity (p = 0.55),
or cover (p = 0.35). In addition, there were no indicator species for speciﬁc restoration treatments and
PERMANOVA analysis showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerences (p = 0.64) in the herbaceous understory and
prostrate shrub communities among treatments. We also found no diﬀerence in the pretreatment means
for overstory variables, shrub density, conifer seedling density, surface, and canopy fuels (p > 0.05)
among restoration treatments. Pretreatment sampling occurred in 2003 when there was below average
annual precipitation (21% deviation) and above average maximum temperature (11% deviation)
(Figure 1).

3.2. Overstory Structure
Several forest structure variables showed a signiﬁcant treatment eﬀect as well as a signiﬁcant
time and treatment × time interaction (Figure 2). We found signiﬁcant diﬀerences in tree density,
canopy cover, and crown base height (CBH) among treatments for each post-treatment year when
we analyzed measurement years separately (Figure 2). Between 1 and 10 years post-treatment,
the overstory dynamics in the control illustrated slightly higher values for all variables (Figure 2).
Tree density decreased after thin/burn and burn treatments, resulting in a signiﬁcant diﬀerence among
each treatment 1, 5, and 10 years post-treatment (p < 0.001). Canopy cover decreased following the
thin/burn treatment, resulting in a long-term signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the thin/burn compared to the
control and burn treatments (p = 0.001). The burn treatment did not result in long-term diﬀerences in
canopy cover when compared to the control.

and control. Bars represent 1 standard error of the mean (n = 4). The vertical line denotes when all
treatments were completed (2008). Data comparisons are among treatments and diﬀerent letters denote
a signiﬁcant treatment eﬀect within a year (p ≤0.05).
3.3. Surface and Canopy Fuels
We found no statistical diﬀerences among treatments in the mean surface fuel loading of the
combined forest ﬂoor and 1–100-h time lag classes, although there was a signiﬁcant time eﬀect (Figure 3).
In general, surface fuels increased over the study period (2003–2018) regardless of the treatment.
By 10 years post-treatment, average surface fuels increased by 156%, 85%, and 162%, respectively,
in the control, burn, and thin/burn treatments when compared to the pretreatment values.
We found no long-term diﬀerences in CBH between the burn and control treatments. CBH
was signiﬁcantly higher in the thin/burn compared to the burn and control treatments within each
post-treatment year (p = 0.002). Initially, one year post full treatment, the thin/burn treatment showed
an increase in CBH from 2.7 m to 12.1 m, but it decreased steadily over time, with a CBH average of
7.7 m 10 years post-treatment. Crown fuel load (CFL) showed a signiﬁcant treatment eﬀect as well as a
signiﬁcant time and treatment × time interaction. CFL decreased after thin/burn treatment, resulting in
a signiﬁcant diﬀerence compared to the control and burn treatments 1, 5, and 10 years post-treatment
(p < 0.001). Ten years following treatment, CFL in the thin/burn treatment was 75% that of the control,
and the CFL means in the burn treatments were 24% of the control with signiﬁcant diﬀerences only
between the control and thin/burn treatments (Figure 3).

mean (n = 4). The vertical line denotes when all treatments were completed (2008). Data comparisons
are among treatments and diﬀerent letters denote a signiﬁcant treatment eﬀect within a year (p ≤0.05).
3.4. Understory Community Dynamics
Repeated measures ANOVA showed no signiﬁcant main eﬀects of treatment on the herbaceous and
prostrate shrub richness (p = 0.91) or cover (p = 0.51), and no signiﬁcant treatment × time interactions
(0.45 and 0.51, respectively) (Figure 4). We found a signiﬁcant treatment × time interaction for diversity
(p = 0.05), and by 2018, diversity was approximately 14% higher in the thin/burn treatments compared to
the control and burn, albeit not statistically signiﬁcant. The 1- (2009) and 10-year (2018) post-treatment
sampling periods had lower than average annual precipitation (16% and 32% deviation, respectively)
and average or above average maximum temperature (0% and 25% deviation, respectively) (Figure 1).
Ten years following treatment, >99% of all plant species within both treatments and the control were
native in origin, with minimal, <0.1%, average non-native understory plant cover. Cirsium arvense was
the most prevalent non-native species and was found on 10% (5%, 21%, and 4%, respectively, in the
control, thin/burn, and burn plots) of the sampling plots. All understory univariate variables varied
through time, though each variable responded diﬀerently over the 15-year study period. For example,
species richness showed an initial increase year one post-treatment for both treatments and the control
followed by a decrease 10 years post-treatment (Figure 4). Diversity for all treatments slightly increased
1 year post-treatment followed by a continued increase 10 years post-treatment for the thin/burn and a
decrease in the control and burn only treatments (p = 0.01; Figure 4). Finally, herbaceous/prostrate
shrub cover increased by 3%, 20%, and 79%, one year following treatments, followed by an increase
of 35%, 33%, and 5% in 2018 (respectively in the control, burn, and thin/burn treatments). Over the
15-year study period, increases in the herbaceous/prostrate shrub cover were driven by the doubling of
graminoid cover across all treatments and a 64% increase in the perennial forb cover in the thin/burn
treatment. By 2018, graminoid cover averaged 10.7% in the control and 9.7% in both the burn and
thin/burn treatments. Perennial forbs averaged 8.9%, 8.8%, and 11.5%, respectively, in the control,
burn, and thin/burn treatments.

diﬀerent letters denote a signiﬁcant treatment eﬀect within a year (p ≤0.05).
When we analyzed the graminoid community data separately from the herbaceous understory
and prostrate shrub community data, there were no diﬀerences in the graminoid community among
treatments as indicated by PERMANOVA (p = 0.55), but there were signiﬁcant diﬀerences across
time (p = 0.00001) for all time comparisons (pre to post-one1 pre to post-10, and post-1 to post-10)
regardless of the treatment. There were no graminoid indicator species for pretreatment or one
year post-treatment, but there were ﬁve C3 graminoid indicator species for 10 years post-treatment:
Poa pratensis, Elymus elymoides, Carex geophila, Poa fendleriana, and Bromus spp. (Table 1).

species for a speciﬁc treatment (control, burn, thin/burn) or time (2003-pretreatment, 2009-1 year
post-treatment, and 2018-10 years post-treatment). There were no 2003 or 2009 indicator graminoid
species. Bromus spp.* includes B. ciliatus, B. lanatipes, and <5% B. inermis.

The herbaceous understory and prostrate shrub communities 10 years post-treatment were
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent among treatments using PERMANOVA analysis.
Speciﬁcally, there were
diﬀerences between the control and thin/burn treatments (p = 0.03) and burn and thin/burn treatments
(p = 0.03). There were two native perennial forb indicator species, P. racemosa and E. divergens,
in the control and one native prostrate shrub indicator species, P. myrsinites, for the burn treatment

(Table 1). There were ﬁve forb indicator species in the thin/burn treatment: Three native perennial
forbs, C. angustifolium, V. americana, and G. boreale; a non-native perennial forb, C. arvense; and one
native biennial, G. amarella (Table 1).
3.5. Midstory Shrubs and Conifer Regeneration
The shrub midstory consists of vegetation 50 cm–8 m in height (Short 1986). Shrubs and conifer
seedling densities responded strongly to inter-annual climatic diﬀerences, but there were signiﬁcant
treatment eﬀects for shrub and conifer seedling densities, as well as a signiﬁcant treatment × time
interaction for conifer seedlings (Figure 5). By 2018, 10 years post-treatment, shrub densities in thin/burn
were on average 24% and 34% greater than the control and burn, respectively. Over the 15-year study
period (2003–2018), mean shrub densities increased by 86%, 76%, and 144%, respectively, in the control,
burn, and thin/burn treatments (Figure 5). Furthermore, the size classes’ distribution shifted toward
taller shrubs, being especially pronounced in the thin/burn treatment (Figure 6). For example, in 2003,
prior to treatments, the proportion of shrubs >80 cm in height was <14% across all treatments and by
2018 this proportion increased to 30%, 27%, and 41%, respectively, in the control, burn, and thin/burn
treatments. A. alnifolia, Q. gambelii, and S. rotundifolius were the dominant species driving the total

Conifer seedling densities showed a main eﬀect of treatment as well as a signiﬁcant time ×
treatment interaction (Figure 5). When analyzed separately within years, we found that conifer
seedling densities did not diﬀer among the three treatments 1 (p = 0.21) or 5 years post-treatment
(p = 0.06); however, by 10 years post-treatment, conifer seedlings were signiﬁcantly lower (p < 0.01) in
the thin/burn treatments compared to the control and burn. Ten years post-treatment, total conifer
seedling density diﬀerences among treatments were driven by A. concolor, P. ponderosa, and P. menziesii
(Table 2).
Midstory community composition indicated a signiﬁcant treatment eﬀect as well as a signiﬁcant
time eﬀect but no signiﬁcant treatment × time interaction (Figure 7). There were four indicator species
reﬂecting a dominance in the thin/burn treatment in 2013: P. virginiana (IV = 71.1, p = 0.04), P. tremuloides
(IV = 62.2, p = 0.04), Q. gambelii (IV = 52.5, p = 0.03), and R. woodsii (IV = 49.4, p = 0.01). There were also
two indicator species in the control treatment in 2013: P. menziesii (IV = 72.8, p = 0.01) and A. concolor
(IV = 61.7, p = 0.04).

4. Discussion
4.1. Overstory Dynamics
Numerous studies have illustrated signiﬁcant shifts in forest structure resulting from forest
restoration treatments in dry forest types [9,23,43–47]. Researchers have found that the most signiﬁcant
eﬀects on forest structure (i.e., stand density, tree canopy cover, and CBH) come from treatments
that include some type of harvest combined with prescribed ﬁre [23,44,48–51]. Restoration and fuel
reduction treatments are designed to change numerous forest stands and ecosystem properties, such as
forest species composition, diameter distributions, and tree vigor [49]. In addition, researchers have
shown that thin/burn treatments have the highest resistance to simulated active and passive crown
ﬁre [44,50,51].
Similar to other studies, we found that thin/burn treatments showed the greatest reduction in
stand density, tree canopy cover, and CBH, but these trends started to diminish 10 years post-treatment.
For example, stand density 10 years post-treatment was 162 trees/ha, an increase from 106 trees/ha one
year post-treatment but still within the 1870 reconstructed reference conditions of 141 trees/ha for our
study site [6]. Similar to stand density, canopy cover (29%) in the thin/burn 10 years post-treatment was
within the midrange of the historical mean canopy cover reference conditions (21%–43%) established
for other mixed-conifer forests in the region [52,53]. However, the burn and untreated controls showed
structural characteristics similar to one another, indicating the low eﬀectiveness of the burn treatment
for altering stand characteristics and meeting restoration goals. This ﬁnding contrasts with a study by
Stephens et al. [45], which showed that prescribed ﬁre did signiﬁcantly alter forest stand structure
and fuel dynamics in mixed-conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada range in California seven years
post-treatment. This disparity likely reﬂects variations in prescribed ﬁre behavior; therefore, land
managers need to align burn conditions with treatment objectives when planning restoration. While the
density in the thin/burn treatment was still signiﬁcantly lower than pre-treatment (677 trees/ha—Fulé
et al. [6]), density will likely continue to increase over time without additional maintenance burning
as shade-tolerant white ﬁr and Douglas ﬁr saplings attain overstory stature. Some researchers have
advocated for higher stand densities to buﬀer against potential mortality that may occur following
harvest or prescribed ﬁre [54,55]. However, the thin/burn stand density in our study stayed neutral or
increased over time following treatment.
4.2. Treatment Eﬀects on Understory Vegetation
Understory vegetation responses to forest restoration treatments in dry forest types are complex
and vary at spatial and temporal scales due to parameters, such as treatment intensity, climate,
and biotic (e.g., overstory and understory vegetation, seed availability, soil microbes, mycorrhizae,
competitive interactions), and abiotic conditions (e.g., light, nutrients, surface fuels, soil substrate
availability) [15,20,22,56–60]. In contrast to other research studies that illustrated diﬀerences among
treatments for species richness, diversity, and cover in dry forest types (e.g., [15,17,58,60,61]), we did not
ﬁnd any signiﬁcant treatment eﬀects in these variables. This disparity may be the result of diﬀerences
in study methodologies, spatial and temporal scales, or site conditions [15,59]. In our study, we found
a signiﬁcant treatment × time interaction for diversity and signiﬁcant time eﬀects for species richness,
diversity, and plant cover. Time eﬀects and interannual variation in understory responses have been
reported for southwestern forest types, where climate can strongly inﬂuence the distribution and
performance of plants [60,62–64].
Although we found no treatment eﬀects on understory cover, graminoid cover doubled across
both treatments and controls over the 10-year study period and led to overall increases in herbaceous
cover. Springer et al. [22] also noted that a doubling of graminoid cover for treated and untreated sites
in mixed-conifer following wildﬁre in northern Arizona and New Mexico contributed to signiﬁcant
plant cover increases over a 4-year period. The authors attributed increases in graminoids to the ability
of wind-dispersed species to colonize disturbed areas rapidly and tolerate xeric conditions under an

Forests 2020, 11, 508
13 of 20
open forest canopy [22]. In our study, C3 graminoids, speciﬁcally ﬁve species, were responsible for
the majority of the graminoid cover increase across both treatments and control. In both treatments
and control, P. pratensis had the highest graminoid indicator value 10 years post-treatment. Similarly,
Strahan et al. [60] illustrated a signiﬁcant three-fold increase of P. pratensis cover across both treatments
and controls in another restoration study in the southwest over a 12-year period and Springer et al. [22]
highlighted that P. pratensis had the third highest graminoid indicator value 5 years post-wildﬁre in
their study. The other four C3 graminoid indicator species in our study were also present in the study
by Strahan et al. [58] but did not show similar patterns of cover increases across time. However, in a
study by Kerns and Day [59], the authors saw an increase across the entire study site for E. elymoides,
which is rhizomatous and a rapid colonizer following disturbance (Moore et al. 2006). Likewise,
Springer et al. [22] also saw signiﬁcant increases in two of our other four graminoid species, C. geophila
and E. elymoides, over a 5-year period regardless of the treatment.
Our ﬁndings suggest that the understory dynamics in these forests are complex and other variables,
such as climate and competition, may play roles on par with thinning and prescribed ﬁre in determining
understory responses. In our study, precipitation was below the long-term average, and the maximum
annual temperature was similar to or above its long-term average, in all three understory sampling
years. These conditions may have contributed to lower understory cover gains in the more open
thin/burn treatment. More research is needed to tease apart understory vegetation responses and
climate eﬀects to better understand forest restoration treatments and inform managers’ expectations
given a warmer drier climate [65].
One common understory vegetation response to forest restoration treatments is an increase in
non-native plants associated with thinning and/or prescribed ﬁre treatments [20,21,57,66]. In our
study, prior to restoration treatments, there was extremely low (<1%) non-native understory species
richness and cover (<0.1%), likely due to the minimal historical disturbances at our study area, which
included one limited tree harvest and restricted grazing [8]. This ﬁnding is consistent with other
studies in ponderosa pine forests, where non-native plants did not increase following restoration
treatments [22,67]. A lack of a signiﬁcant treatment eﬀect on understory cover in our study may be
the result of high pre-existing spatial variability within individual restoration treatment units prior to
treatment that remained following treatments. In addition, strong shrub responses may have inhibited
herbaceous establishment and growth.
4.3. Future Resiliency
One of the main objectives for fuel reduction treatments is to decrease connectivity between surface
and canopy fuel layers and reduce the chance for initiation and propagation of crown ﬁre [49,68,69].
Of all the forest structure variables in our study, CBH had the largest change between 1 and and
10 years post-treatment in the thin/burn. Speciﬁcally, CBH went from over a 300% increase in the
thin/burn one year after treatment to almost a 100% decrease 1 to 10 years post-treatment. During
the same time period, CBH slightly increased in the control and burn 1 to 10 years post-treatment.
The signiﬁcant increase in CBH in the thin/burn 1 year post-treatment is consistent with numerous
other studies [44,45,49,50]; however, the decrease in CBH over the following 9 years is concerning from
a fuel reduction standpoint.
Restoration treatments that include some type of harvest generally show a reduction in
CFL [44–46,48,50,70]. Indeed, we saw a 75% signiﬁcant decrease in CFL in the thin/burn treatment
compared to the control 10 years post-treatment, with no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in CFL for the burn
treatments compared to controls. Tree harvest also may have an immediate increase in surface
fuels [23,28,44,45] while subsequent burning may then reduce surface fuels by as much as 90% [49,71].
Without prior thinning, ﬁrst-entry prescribed ﬁre may increase surface fuels due to mortality and
the fall of small trees [45]. In our study, surface fuels increased immediately across both treatments
and controls, then continued to increase across the monitoring period, with no signiﬁcant diﬀerences
between treatments. These additional fuels most likely are the result of small trees dying due to

Forests 2020, 11, 508
14 of 20
competition or disease in our controls, small harvested trees lopped and scattered in our thin/burn
treatments, and small ﬁre-killed trees in burn treatments. Another possible input of surface fuels
is shrub biomass. Midstory vegetation, such as tall shrubs, plays an important role in crown ﬁre
initiation and support because it serves as a transition fuel (i.e., ladder) between the surface and
canopy fuels. Thus, one of the most eﬀective ways to alter ﬁre behavior is to break the continuity of the
surface, ladder, and crown fuels [69,72]. We found a >250% increase in shrub density over our 10-year
monitoring period in treatments as well as the control, suggesting climate was an important driver
of shrub responses (Figure 8). In addition, over the 10 years post-treatment, we saw an increase in
the average shrub height for both treatments and the control, with shrub stems >80 cm becoming the
dominant size class in the thin/burn treatment. The overall increase in both the shrub density and
mean height class for both treatments and controls over 15 years illustrates that our stands, regardless
of the treatment, became more susceptible over time to crown ﬁre behavior due to the transitional fuel
source between the surface and forest canopy.
Figure 8. Repeat photos taken from alternative restoration treatments before treatment (2003), 5 years
after treatment (2013), and 10 years after (2018).
The three most dominant shrub species at our site were S. rotundifolius, Q. gambelii, and A. alnifolia,
all of which resprout after ﬁre [73,74]. In addition, Q. gambelii has a high drought tolerance due to
deep roots, xeromorphic leaves, and eﬃcient water transport [75–77]. The immediate shrub response
to thin/burn and burn treatments is commonly a decrease in stem density and/or cover [18,78,79].
Our ﬁndings followed this pattern as all treatments, including the control, showed an immediate
decrease in shrub density one-year post-treatment. Following this decrease, however, we saw a

Forests 2020, 11, 508
15 of 20
signiﬁcant increase 5 years post-treatment for both treatments and controls, with signiﬁcantly higher
shrub density in the thin/burn treatments than burn or controls, which is similar to other ﬁndings [11].
Previous research has illustrated that shrub density begins to decrease as shrub height increases [80,81].
Approximately 40% of all shrub stems were >80 cm 10 years post-treatment in our thin/burn treatments,
supporting the inverse relationship between shrub density and height found in other studies.
In addition to increasing ladder fuels and inhibiting herbaceous plant responses, shrub density in
our study may also have limited conifer regeneration in the thin/burn treatment. Numerous studies
have quantiﬁed short-term eﬀects of shrubs on conifer regeneration [17,18], but fewer studies have
investigated long-term trends [11,78]. Conifer seedlings described in this study generally decrease
immediately following thinning and prescribed ﬁre treatments either from direct ﬁre mortality, a
reduced number of seed-producing trees, or a lack of a ﬁre-prepared seedbed [17,78,82]. We saw
a similar response in our study, where seedling densities decreased by 51% and 94% for burn
and thin/burn, respectively, 1 year post-treatment. Furthermore, 10 years post-treatment, conifer
seedling densities remained signiﬁcantly lower in the thin/burn compared with the control and burn
treatments. Recent research has illustrated that under a warmer drier climate, forests are susceptible to
shrub-type conversion without adequate conifer regeneration, especially in areas that have experienced
high-severity wildﬁre [83–85].
5. Conclusions and Management Implications
A common goal for forest restoration treatments in dry forest types is to restore ecosystem
function and promote resiliency to future disturbances by altering forest structure and reducing fuel
accumulations through mechanical treatments and prescribed ﬁre [6,9,12,72,86]. In our study, 10 years
post-treatment for the burn only and thin/burn treatments, some of the initial treatment beneﬁts to
promote resiliency to future disturbances had already or were starting to diminish (e.g., increasing
shrub density and decreasing crown base heights). In addition, our main ﬁnding of no strong long-term
treatment eﬀect on the native herbaceous understory and prostrate shrubs is consistent with several
published studies [57,59]. Cover increases in the control and burn treatments between 2009 and 2018
negated the initial gains of cover in the thin/burn treatment, which in turn showed shallower gains in
cover over this time period. This pattern, taken together with the vigorous midstory shrub responses,
suggests that herbaceous abundance may have been inhibited by increases in the midstory shrub layer.
Such responses may present a challenge to managers aiming to reduce fuel loading and potential
for crown ﬁre in these systems. More frequent monitoring of the herbaceous layer would assist in
gaining a better understanding of the interactions of climate variability and competition with other
vegetation layers [15,61,87]. Given the transient nature of some of our forest restoration treatment
eﬀects 10 years post-treatment, re-entry with prescribed ﬁre is one tool that managers could use if the
main management goal is to raise CBH and decrease shrub ladder fuels that can transition surface ﬁre
to the tree canopy, tree canopy cover, CFL, and surface fuels. This recommendation is consistent with
Reynolds et al.’s [4] recommendation that forest restoration treatments in southwestern forests with
frequent ﬁre regimes may need multiple treatments to meet broad forest restoration goals. However,
given the lack of conifer regeneration in the thin/burn treatments and the dominance of shrubs in the
midstory, additional prescribed ﬁre treatments may be a tipping point that facilitates a type conversion
in the midstory from conifer to shrubs in the event of a major disturbance, such as severe drought,
insect outbreak, or wildﬁre. Under a warmer drier climate with more high severity ﬁre, researchers
have predicted that type conversions from forest to shrub communities will become more common
due to a lack of conifer regeneration [83,84]. As a result, managers will need to balance long-term
restoration and fuel mitigation goals, which may conﬂict given the variable treatment responses we
identiﬁed in our study. Overall, there is a need for additional long-term studies that quantify long-term
forest restoration eﬀects to provide land managers the information they need to allocate limited funds
and resources to maintaining existing treatments or implementing novel restoration treatments to
address future uncertainties [45].
