ecause of fire exclusion and in-
appropriate past management
actions, approximately two-
thirds of the 200 million acres of feder-
ally managed wildlands adapted to fre-
quent ﬁre regimes are in moderately to
severely degraded condition (Intera-
gency Working Group 2001). The ex-
traordinary severity of the Cerro
Grande fire in New Mexico in 2000
underscored both the scale of the prob-
lem in ponderosa pine forests and the
challenges associated with prescribed
burning without beneﬁt of mechanical
fuel treatments. Reduction of haz-
ardous fuels can be attempted at levels
ranging from prescribed underburning,
a minimal-impact approach, to com-
plete stripping of forest cover, the max-

Forest restoration treatments of thinning young trees followed by prescribed burning in north-
western Arizona led to significantly lower stand density, lower crown fuel load, and higher
crown base height than untreated stands. Simulated fire under extreme weather conditions
caused 48 percent more canopy burning and higher flame lengths, heat/area, and rate of
spread in untreated stands. Wind speeds required for passive crown fire (torching) were twice
as high in treated stands. Treated stands were highly heterogeneous, but restoration treat-
ments clearly enhanced crown-fire resistance.

nia’s Ponderosa Way fuelbreak (Pyne et
al. 1996). For resource managers and
communities struggling to deal with
wildfire hazards, it is increasingly im-
portant to test treatment alternatives
and compare the relative efﬁcacy of ﬁre
hazard reduction techniques. 
Modeling potential fire behavior is
the most common approach to com-
paring treatments, because most
treated areas cannot be “tested” by de-
liberately igniting a crown fire (see
Agee et al. [2000] for an unplanned
test—and failure—of a fuelbreak).
Models of crown-fire behavior are
complex and poorly understood (Scott
1998), but they are important for as-
sessing the potential behavior of high-
intensity crown fires with high resis-
tance to control. For example, Kal-
abokidis and Omi (1998) thinned
lodgepole pine plots in Colorado, ap-
plied standard models to predict sur-
face ﬁre behavior, and inferred crown-
fire 
impacts 
using 
nomograms
(Rothermel 1991). Scott (1998) inte-
grated surface and crown-fire algo-
rithms to develop a stand-scale model-
ing approach for testing alternative
thinning and burning treatments in a
Montana ponderosa pine forest. At the
landscape scale, Stephens (1998) used
the Farsite model as an assessment tool
for contrasting treatments. 
Restorative 
management 
ap-
proaches offer the prospect of improve-
ment in ecological parameters such as
productivity and diversity, while simul-
taneously reducing fuel hazards and
fire severity (Covington et al. 1997).
Many ecosystems adapted to frequent
fire, such as ponderosa and related
long-needled western pines, exhibit
hazardous fuel accumulations and se-
vere wildﬁres as the symptoms of eco-
logical imbalances (Wagner et al.
2000). Although experiments initiated
by Scott (1998), Lynch et al. (2000),
Moore et al. (1999), and others are be-
ginning to provide information on eco-
logical responses, these studies are in
early post-treatment phases. Many
variables are likely to fluctuate widely
in the first years after treatment be-
cause rapid successional changes are al-
tering plant and animal communities.
Potential fire behavior, however, is an
environmental factor that can be af-
fected by treatment in a short time and
have long-term effects.
One of the first replicated stand-
level experiments in forest restoration
in the Southwest began in 1995 as a
collaboration between the Bureau of
Land Management (BLM) Arizona
Strip District, the Arizona Game and
Fish Department, and the Ecological
Restoration Institute of Northern Ari-
zona University. 
Methods 
The overall project is broad in
scope, testing both landscape- and
stand-scale treatments, with researchers
investigating a broad array of ecosys-
tem responses. Here we report on the
effects of forest restoration on fuel re-
duction, comparing potential behavior
of wildfire modeled under extreme
weather conditions to assess differences
between treatment and control stands.
The Mount Trumbull study site is
located in the Uinkaret Mountains on
the Arizona Strip, north of the Col-
orado River (latitude 36°22'N, longi-
tude 113°7'W). Soils are derived from
volcanic substrates. Annual precipita-
tion at Mount Trumbull averaged 19.9
inches (1977 to 1997), mostly occur-
ring in winter and during the summer
monsoon (July–September). Vegeta-
tion includes ponderosa pine (Pinus
ponderosa)–Gambel oak (Quercus gam-
belii) forest. Utah juniper (Juniperus os-
teosperma), pinyon (Pinus edulis), New
Mexican locust (Robinia neomexicana),
and shrub species are interspersed in
the pine-oak forest. As elsewhere in the
Southwest, surface fires were frequent
(mean ﬁre intervals of  5–7 years [P.Z.
Fulé et al., unpublished data]) prior to
European settlement of the region be-
ginning in 1870, when livestock graz-
ing, logging, and ﬁre suppression led to
substantial increases in forest density
(Moore et al. 1999).
Four experimental blocks were es-
tablished in 1997, representing the
range of elevation and forest structure
in the Mount Trumbull forest. Treat-
ments (restoration and control) were
randomly assigned to nominally 20-
acre units in each block. Twenty per-
manent monitoring plots were estab-
lished in each unit during July–August
1997 (block 1) and April–July 1998 
(N = 160 plots). Plots were located on
a 196.8-foot grid, corresponding to a
measured experimental area of 17.8
acres per treatment unit. Overstory
trees taller than breast height (4.5 feet)
were measured on a 4,306-square-foot
circular fixed-area plot. Trees below
breast height and shrubs were tallied by
condition class and by height classes on
a nested 1,076-square-foot subplot.
Plant species, substrate, and overstory
canopy cover (vertical projection) were
recorded every 11.8 inches along a
164-foot line transect–oriented ups-
lope. Dead woody biomass and forest
floor depth were measured on a 50-
foot planar transect in a random direc-
tion from each plot center. 
The forest restoration prescription
was designed to rapidly emulate his-
toric forest structure, followed by rein-
troduction of surface fire. All old-
growth (predating 1870) trees of all
species were retained. Where snags,
fallen trees, or stumps evidenced old
conifers that had died, three younger
trees of the same species within a 30- to
60-foot radius were selected as replace-
ments (Covington et al. 1997). Fire-
susceptible deciduous species (oak and
locust) were not thinned. Thinning
was carried out by commercial contrac-
tors and BLM crews in 1999. Slash was
lopped and scattered. Deep duff layers
were raked 1 to 3 feet away from boles
of all old-growth trees and snags. Treat-
ment units were burned in the winter
of 1999–2000. Plots were remeasured
during May–July 2000. 
Weather conditions for ﬁre model-

ing were based on the 90th and 97th
percentiles of low fuel moisture, high
winds, and high temperature from 34
years of data on the Kaibab National
Forest (Tusayan weather station) using
the FireFamily Plus program (Brad-
shaw and Brittain 1999). Weather val-
ues were calculated for the entire fire
season (April 23 to October 16) as well
as for June, historically the month with
the most severe ﬁre weather (table 1). 
Fire behavior was modeled with the
Nexus Fire Behavior and Hazard As-
sessment System (Scott and Reinhardt
1999). Crown fuels were estimated
with allometric equations for foliage
and ﬁne twigs of ponderosa pine (Fulé
et al. 2001), Gambel oak (Clary and
Tiedemann 1986), and pinyon and ju-
niper (Grier et al. 1992). Crown vol-
ume was estimated by the averages of
maximum tree height (top of the
canopy) and crown base height (bot-
tom of the canopy). Crown bulk den-
sity was calculated as crown biomass
divided by crown volume. For the pur-
poses of predicting passive crown-fire
behavior (torching), we used the lowest
quintile (20 percent) of crown base
heights in each stand. Stand character-
istics and model outputs were com-
pared with multivariate analysis of vari-
ance followed by post-hoc univariate
comparisons (F test, alpha = 0.05). 
Results
There were no significant differ-
ences in tree density or basal area be-
tween treatment and control pairs
prior to thinning and burning. After
treatment, restoration stands had sig-
nificantly lower pine density, lower
crown fuel load, and higher crown base
height (table 2). Although crown fuel
load in treated stands averaged only
half that of control stands (54 percent),
crown bulk density in the treatments
averaged 85 percent of control stands.
This counterintuitive result is an arti-
fact of raising crown base height when
small trees were thinned, reducing
crown volume. For instance, in block 4
the treated stand had a slightly higher
crown bulk density than the control
despite having half the crown biomass. 
Fire model results (table 3) should
be interpreted with caution. The mod-

els are highly sensitive to crown base
height, wind speed (or wind reduction
factor), fuel moisture, and surface fuel
model variables (1H fuel loading,
herbaceous fuels, surface-area-to-vol-
ume ratio, fuel bed depth). The behav-
ior of real ﬁres in these stands would be
affected by variability in fuels and
weather, roads, meadows, surrounding
forest fuels, landscape topography, and
suppression activities. The standard ﬁre
behavior fuel model 9 was intended to
represent long-term surface fuels, not
the activity fuels that were actually pre-
sent immediately after thinning. How-
ever, when used to compare the treat-
ment alternatives under a common
weather scenario, the analysis provided
an excellent basis for assessing relative
differences in potential ﬁre behavior.
Fires simulated under the severe
weather conditions were fast and hot in
all stands, but ﬁre behavior was signiﬁ-
cantly less intense in the treated stands
(table 3). Crown-ﬁre behavior includes
both passive (torching) and active
canopy burning. Crown burning was
predicted in all of the control stands,
three with passive crown ﬁre consum-
ing 38 to 68 percent of the canopy and
the fourth with active crown fire and
complete canopy consumption. Treated
stands were not immune from passive
crown ﬁre because small oak and locust
trees were not thinned, so the lowest
quintile crown base heights remained
below 10 feet in three of the four
treated stands. The treatment unit in
block 2, with the most oak, had the
lowest crown base and lowest torching
index (minimum wind speed that
would support passive crown fire).
However, treated stands averaged only
20 percent canopy burned, while con-
trols averaged 68 percent. High flame
lengths (average 11.8 feet) and heat/
area values (average 673 Btu per square
foot) were predicted in the treated
stands, consistent with torching ex-
pected to occur in portions of the units,
but ﬂame length and heat/area were sig-
nificantly higher in controls (average
38.0 feet and 1,780 Btu per square
foot). 
In contrast to the torching index,
crowning index was most closely re-
lated to crown bulk density. The two
indices were poorly correlated. For ex-
ample, the treated stand in block 2 had
a low crown base height (4.5 feet), so
the torching index was correspond-
ingly low (11.2 miles per hour), but
block 2 had an intermediate crown
bulk density value (0.00260 pounds
per cubic foot), so the crowning index
was also intermediate (43.0 miles per
hour). The opposite occurred in the
treated stand in block 4: The high
crown bulk density led to a low crown-
ing index of 22.4 miles per hour, less
than the 30-mile-per-hour modeled
winds, but no canopy burning was pre-
dicted because the high crown base
height (25.2 feet) prevented fire from
entering the crowns.
Treatment and control stand char-
acteristics from Mount Trumbull are
compared graphically with other
southwestern sites in figure 1, p. 28.
Other experiments included a restora-
tion treatment at Grand Canyon
(Kaibab National Forest: Fulé et al., in
review); at the Flagstaff wildland-urban
interface (Coconino National Forest:
Fulé et al. 2001); and the Forests For-
ever! treatment designed by the South-
west Forest Alliance (1996), a consor-
tium of environmental activist groups.
Stand characteristics were broadly vari-
able, but restoration sites at Mount
Trumbull and on the national forests
clearly grouped toward high crown-ﬁre
resistance (high crowning index), asso-
ciated with low crown biomass and
basal area. Only the most dense of

toward low crown-fire resistance and
high crown biomass and basal area.
The Forests Forever! treatments, inten-
tionally designed as a lower-impact for-
est restoration approach (SWFA
1996), fell in the middle between con-
trol and restoration stands. This out-
come implies that the lighter thinning
of Forests Forever! provided measur-
able but minimal improvement in
crown-ﬁre resistance. 
Discussion
Nexus and similar fire behavior
models offer a valuable approach for
making 
quantitative 
comparisons
across study sites. These comparisons
provide a fair, quantitative basis for
managers to evaluate the ﬁre behavior
implications of alternative treatments.
And they make important contribu-
tions to public discussions over treat-
ments to reduce hazardous fuels.
Forest stands were highly variable in
stand characteristics following the site-
specific restoration treatments, as
shown in table 2 and ﬁgure 1, reﬂecting
the heterogeneity of natural forest con-
ditions. While conserving the range of
structural variability, however, restora-
tion treatments shifted the entire dis-
tribution toward significantly more
crown-fire resistance. Application of
restoration treatments across the larger
landscape of the Mount Trumbull
highlands would be expected to result
in a complex, fine-grained mosaic of
forest structural conditions, relatively
immune from severe wildﬁre and rela-
tively safe for prescribed burning or
wildland ﬁre use for resource beneﬁts. 
Forest restoration is a viable ap-
proach for shaded fuelbreaks, area
treatments (Agee et al. 2000), and
urban interface fuel hazard reduction.
The primary advantage of restoration
is the ability to simultaneously address
fire issues and other broad objectives
consistent with the evolutionary envi-
ronment of the ecosystem. Clewell
(2000, p. 217) described the process of
ecological restoration as “secur[ing] our
future by restocking a dangerously de-
pleted global inventory of natural
areas.” Such comprehensive goals ex-
tend well beyond ameliorating wildﬁre
concerns. If restorative management
proves even partially successful in re-
capturing the native productivity and
diversity of degraded ecosystems, fuel
hazard reduction may eventually be
seen as a useful but incidental beneﬁt.
The particular restoration design
used at Mount Trumbull may not be
suitable in all critical ﬁre areas. We re-
tained moderately dense stands still
subject to some degree of passive crown
fire. Maintenance burning is required
to check new reproduction from reoc-
cupying the lower stratum of the stand.
Because conifers were retained well in
excess of the historic (pre-1870) forest
density, due to the 3:1 replacement
ratio, future thinning entries or snag
creation treatments might be necessary
to maintain open forest conditions. 
Fire hazard is only one of many vari-
ables that enter into ecosystem manage-
ment decisions. The fuel hazard reduc-
tion beneﬁts of forest restoration are ap-
parent as soon as thinning and burning
have been completed, but long-term
monitoring is necessary to measure re-
sponses of plant and animal communi-
ties, tree mortality and regeneration,
and biogeochemical and disturbance
processes (e.g., Oliver and Powers
1998). Continued experimentation and
adaptive application of monitoring re-
sults are also necessary. Arguably the
most beneﬁcial outcome of the Forests
Forever! treatment has been the stimu-
lation of inquiry on the part of envi-
ronmental activists to formulate and
implement an alternative restoration ap-
proach. Engagement and testing of
ideas by groups across the spectrum of
public land stakeholders may be one of
the most effective ways to advance
thoughtful management of ecosystems.

Figure 1. Comparison of forest basal and crown biomass with crown-ﬁre index (minimal wind 
speed required to sustain active crown ﬁre) shows that high variability exists in both treated and 
untreated forests, but restoration treatments lead to higher crown-ﬁre resistance. Study sites 
include the four Mount Trumbull units described in the text as well as analogous sites on the 
Kaibab (Grand Canyon) and Coconino (Flagstaff) National Forests. The Forests Forever! treatment
was developed by the Southwest Forest Alliance and implemented on the Kaibab and Gila National 
Forests. It was intermediate in stand and ﬁre characteristics.
