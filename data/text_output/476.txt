ABSTRACT 
 
ESTIMATING GROUNDWATER YIELD FOLLOWING FOREST RESTORATION 
ALONG THE MOGOLLON RIM, ARIZONA 
 
Clinton J. W. Wyatt 
 
Landscape-scale forest restoration treatments are planned for four national forests 
in Northern Arizona: the Coconino, Kaibab, Tonto, and Apache-Sitgreaves National 
Forests. The first analysis area comprises 900,000 acres on the Coconino and Kaibab 
National Forests were the U.S. Forest Service is proposing restoration activities on 
approximately 600,000 acres over a ten year period pending acceptance of an 
Environmental Impact Statement. These forest restoration treatments are intended to 
accomplish a number of objectives including reducing the threat of catastrophic wild fire 
and subsequent flooding and to restore forest health, function, and resiliency. Previous 
studies have shown that in semi-arid, ponderosa pine watersheds there was a possibility 
to increase surface water yields 15-40% when basal area was reduced by 30-100%. 
Because of these results, there is considerable interest in the amount of increased water 
that may recharge from these activities.  
The objectives of this study were two-fold: 1) examine the state of knowledge of 
forest restoration thinning and its hydrological responses and to evaluate the quality and 
type of references that exist within the literature; and 2) simulate possible changes in 
recharge and groundwater yield following forest restoration treatments and climate 
change. A systematic review process following the guidelines suggested by the 

iii 
 
Collaboration for Environmental Evidence was conducted to examine literature relevant 
to this topic. The Northern Arizona Regional Groundwater-Flow Model was used to 
simulate the changes expected from forest restoration treatments and climate change.  
The systematic review returned 37 references that were then used to answer our 
questions regarding tree removal and its hydrological responses. Data from individual 
studies suggested that forest treatments that reduce tree density, increase water yield and 
groundwater recharge while reducing evapotranspiration. Specifically, when 20-100% of 
a conifer-dominated watershed was treated, the literature shows a 0-40% increase in 
water yield. Although one study showed a correlation, there was no overall correlation 
for all studies between percent area treated and groundwater recharge. Results are highly 
variable, and diminish within five to ten years for water yield increases and even quicker 
(< 4 years) for groundwater table heights.  
Using a groundwater-flow model, it was estimated that over the ten-year period of 
forest restoration treatment, a 1% increase in annual recharge to regional aquifers was 
estimated compared to 2000-2005 conditions. However, these increases were assumed to 
quickly decline after treatment due to regrowth of vegetation and forest underbrush. 
Furthermore, predicted groundwater recharge increases were masked by decreases in 
water levels, stream baseflow, and groundwater storage resulting from surface water 
diversions and groundwater pumping. These results showed that there is an imbalance 
between water supply and demand, that current practices are not likely to be sustainable 
into the far future, and that comprehensive action should be taken to minimize this 
imbalance.

CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE 
 
There have been very few studies that have attempted to quantify the relationship 
between forest thinning and groundwater recharge; even fewer studies have looked at this 
relationship in arid and semi-arid climates. Many studies have looked at the effect that 
removing trees, often by clear-cutting, will have on surface water runoff (Bosch and 
Hewlett, 1982, Brown 2005). Other studies have looked at the effect that tree removal has 
on evapotranspiration, soil moisture storage, and snowpack accumulation (Kolb et al., 
2009, Bazan et al., 2012, Stegman, 1996). Because of the dearth of groundwater studies 
in these areas, there is significant uncertainty with regards to how regional aquifers, 
streams, and springs in northern Arizona will be affected by landscape-scale forest 
restoration thinning that is planned on four national forests beginning in 2014. There is a 
need to fill this knowledge gap so that appropriate management practices can incorporate 
any change in groundwater recharge following restoration.  
 
Based on previous research it is anticipated that forest restoration thinning 
treatments planned for the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (Draft EIS Chapter 1, 2012) 
will increase groundwater recharge by a modest yet significant amount. The reasoning for 
this increase is that removing trees will cause a decrease in ET (sublimation is included in 
this variable) and an increase in snowpack accumulation. With more snow and less ET, 
more water will be available to infiltrate into the soils, increasing soil moisture storage 
and enhancing percolation down to the regional aquifers. This could result in an increase 

2 
 
in groundwater recharge and water available for storage to regional aquifers in northern 
Arizona.  
 
A numerical groundwater flow-model recently developed by the U. S. Geological 
Ssurvey (USGS) (Pool et al., 2011) called the Northern Arizona Regional Groundwater 
Flow-Model (NARGFM) will be used to simulate how these forest restorations will 
impact groundwater recharge to the Coconino and Redwall-Muav aquifers in northern 
Arizona. Downscaled climate data available through the U. S. Bureau of Reclamation 
(Reclamation) will also be used to determine future climatic impact on the water budget 
for the area of interest. Five scenarios, including one baseline scenario, one historical 
scenario, and three scenarios derived from IPCC climate scenarios will be simulated with 
the NARGFM.  
 
1.2 BACKGROUND 
 
This research is part of a larger project: a collaboration between Salt River Project 
(SRP) and Northern Arizona University’s Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI).  The 
goal of this project is to determine the effects of alternative forest treatments and wildfire 
on hydrologic and natural resource responses. These effects have important implications 
for landscape-scale ecosystem restorations, long-term forecasting and planning for water 
availability, water quality and sedimentation, and adaptive management practices being 
implemented for the 4FRI. The research presented here fulfilled two tasks of the work 
that was planned. Other tasks included the design and implementation of a paired 
watershed study, development of a data server where data, results, and findings will be 
made accessible to cooperators and managers, and the development of a monitoring 

3 
 
program following forest restoration. Results from this and other research will be used to 
inform management decisions for the Four Forest Restoration Initiative.      
 
1.2.1 THE FOUR FOREST RESTORATION INITIATIVE 
 
The Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI) is a proposal by the United States 
Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Forest Service to conduct restoration thinning and 
burning treatments in four national forests located along the Mogollon Rim in northern 
Arizona (Figure 1). These forests are ponderosa pine (Pinus  
 
Figure 1. Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI) map detailing national forests, major 
roads, and boundaries (from 4FRI.org). 

4 
 
ponderosa) dominated ecosystems located at elevations between 6000-8000 feet. These 
forests receive between 20-30 inches of precipitation annually. The Apache-Sitgreaves, 
Coconino, Kaibab, and Tonto National Forests, comprise 2.4 million acres of federal 
forest land. Additional treatments are being planned for non-federal forest lands. There 
are four alternatives being considered for the 4FRI treatments: A-D. For this project we 
used alternative C. This alternative focuses on addressing concerns about the preservation 
of large trees and incorporates key components from the stakeholder-created Large Tree 
Retention Strategy.  
 
The purpose of these treatments is to reduce the threat of catastrophic wild fire 
and subsequent flooding and to restore forest health, function, and resiliency. Because 
historical practices such as old-growth logging and fire suppression have increased the 
density of young trees and forest underbrush, these forests are considered high risk for 
crown-fires. Crown-fires are fires that burn extremely hot – too hot for naturally, fire-
adapted ecosystems like ponderosa pine forests – and burn all the way up the tree to the 
crown. These types of fires are considered unnatural and cause significant damage to the 
forest ecosystem, water resources, and structures in the immediate vicinity of the fire, 
including businesses, schools, and homes. The 4FRI treatments will remove this excess 
fuel and significantly reduce the risk of crown-fires. 
Healthy forested watersheds are life-support systems that are critical to the 
survival of flora and fauna living within and around a watershed. They also provide 
numerous ecosystem services that benefit humans and are important to the well-being and 
livelihood of nearby communities. These natural assets include provisioning (food and 
water), regulating (climate and carbon storage), supporting (soil formation and nutrient 

5 
 
cycling), and cultural (education and aesthetic) services (Deal, 2008). Overuse of healthy 
ecosystems can diminish their capacity to provide these services. Of critical importance 
in the southwestern U. S. and other semi-arid regions is the preservation and restoration 
of forested watersheds to ensure and restore their ability to provide clean and abundant 
water. The 4FRI plans to make these forested ecosystems healthy enough to provide these 
benefits to natural and human communities. 
The first analysis area slated for treatment includes approximately 900,000 acres 
on the Coconino and Kaibab National Forests (Draft EIS Chapter 1, 2012). 
Approximately 600,000 acres of this area is expected to receive some sort of treatment. 
The treatments are expected to last a decade, and to begin sometime in 2014. Not 
included in 4FRI are additional areas, called shelf-stock, which will be treated in a similar 
manner along a similar timeline. These areas were included in the model simulations. A 
second round of restoration treatments is anticipated for additional parts of the Coconino 
and Kaibab National Forests, as well as areas within the Apache-Sitgreaves and Tonto 
National Forests. However, the exact details of these treatments for the second analysis 
area are uncertain. Because of this treatment uncertainty, only the first analysis area was 
included in the model simulations. Currently, an EIS is being prepared to analyze the 
environmental, social, and economic impacts that forest restoration thinning and burning 
treatments will have. 
 
The forest restoration treatments are intended to accomplish a number of 
objectives. The treatments will reduce stand density within selected areas up to >50% 
(Draft EIS Chapter 1, 2012).  They will restore a balance of age and class sizes to the 
forest, 50% of which lacks this diversity and is instead an even-aged structure. Uneven-

6 
 
aged thinning (UEA) will be the most heavily used tree-removal treatment in the 4FRI 
area. This method will establish interspaces between adjacent groups of 50 to 70 square 
feet of basal area, establish tree groups of 0.1 to 1 acre in size with 4 to 20 dominant and 
co-dominant trees per 1/10 acre, produce interlocking crowns between mid-age and older 
trees to produce >40% canopy cover, as well as a number of other features. 
 
Additional thinning treatments include intermediate thinning and stand 
improvement thinning. These treatments will increase vegetation diversity and 
composition, including reestablishing aspen, grasslands, pine-sage, and a variety of oak 
size classes and forms that are important to many wildlife species. They will restore 
natural fire regimes and reduce the estimated 41% of the project area able to support 
crown fires to 5-10%. The treatments will also restore the function of a number of 
springs, and ephemeral streams throughout the forests, of which there are thousands, all 
of which are important to wildlife habitat, forest health, and water users in Arizona. 
 
1.2.2 DOWNSCALED CLIMATE DATA 
 
Bias corrected and downscaled climate data from the World Climate Research 
Programme’s (WCRP) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) multi-
model data set were used to simulate future changes in precipitation in the study area 
(Maurer et. al., 2007). These datasets include monthly climate projections over the 
contiguous United States as well as monthly hydrologic projections over the western 
United States. Both sets of data are simulated to the year 2099. The goal of the project 
was to coordinate the activities of climate modeling groups that have produced hundreds 
of simulations of past and future climates for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 

7 
 
Change’s (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). These simulations are available 
through the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Reclamation’s Research and 
Development office. Over 100 projections of monthly temperature and precipitation from 
16 models are available at 1/8 by 1/8 (12 km x 12 km) spatial resolution over the lower 
48 states (Reclamation, 2012). We used the multi-model mean from all 16 models for the 
A1B, A2, and B1 climate scenarios to set our climate change boundaries. This way we 
were able to utilize the full ensemble of climate simulations for each model emission 
scenario.  
 
1.2.3 THE NOTHERN ARIZONA REGIONAL GROUNDWATER-FLOW MODEL 
 
A numerical groundwater-flow model (MODFLOW), called the Northern Arizona 
Regional Groundwater-Flow Model, or NARGFM, was recently developed by the USGS 
to simulate the interactions between regional aquifers, streams, and springs in northern 
Arizona and to assess the adequacy of groundwater resources and the effect of increased 
pumping, especially in the Verde River basin, would have on these resources (Pool et al., 
2011) (Figure 2). For this project, the model was used as a tool to estimate how the 4FRI 
forest restoration thinning treatments and climate scenarios will impact recharge to 
recharge aquifers, streams, and springs. Because this is a groundwater model, recharge, 
not precipitation, was modified to determine these impacts.  
 
The origin of the NARGFM is the Arizona Department of Water Resources’ 
Rural Watershed Initiative (RWI), a program with a goal to understand the adequacy of 
water supplies in rural areas with growing populations, a characteristic of the 
southwestern United States. RWI reports for three areas have been studied, including the  

8 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Northern Arizona regional groundwater flow model boundaries and vegetative 
cover map. (From Pool et. al. 2011.)  
 
 
Coconino Plateau (Bills et al., 2007), the upper and middle Verde River watersheds 
(Blasch et al., 2006), and the Mogollon Highlands (Parker et al., 2005). These areas, 
which comprise over 17,000 sq. mi. of federal, state, private, and tribal lands, are among 
the fastest growing locations in the United States. Because of this growth, and the relative 
scarcity of water in the dry, southwestern U.S., a numerical flow model was deemed 
necessary so that future investigators such as cities, land managers, and tribal authorities 

9 
 
could investigate the effect that anticipated increases in pumping may have on 
groundwater resources. 
 
The model was developed using hydrologic data and information acquired from 
the three RWI studies. Rather than developing groundwater flow models for each distinct 
region and/or administratively defined basin or sub-basin, a regional framework was used 
to simulate the interconnectedness and dependency of groundwater basins and sub-basins 
– and their respective communities – on each other. This allowed and will allow resource 
managers to examine the hydrologic consequences of groundwater development not only 
on their own resources, but on the resources of surrounding communities. This increases 
the scope of projects undertaken by and the awareness of water users. 
 
Though the NARGFM was developed to assess the adequacy of groundwater 
supplies in the study area, with an emphasis on the effects of groundwater withdrawals on 
regional water tables and flow systems, for this project it is used to explore how land-use 
and climate change will affect groundwater resources. Rather than adjusting pumping 
scenarios based on anticipated population growth and groundwater withdrawal, recharge 
rates were modified to simulate how restoration forest thinning, an event that will remove 
trees and is likely to decrease evapotranspiration and increase snowpack, and how 
climate change, an event that is very likely to occur and affect precipitation and 
temperature in the area, will impact the regional water budget and groundwater system. A 
systematic review was conducted following the Collaboration for Environmental 
Evidence’s systematic review guidelines to resolve the state of knowledge with respect to 
forest restoration thinning and its hydrological responses and to evaluate the quality and 
type of references that exist within the literature (CEE, 2010).  The results from the 

10 
 
systematic review were used to determine appropriate factors of change in recharge. We 
then applied these factors to the NARGFM to simulate changes in groundwater recharge 
following forest treatments. Similar recharge-change factors were used to simulate 
changes in precipitation from regional climate change. 
  
1.3 PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 
 
The purpose of this study was to review estimate how the 4FRI treatments, 
additional shelf-stock treatments, and future climate scenarios will impact the water 
budget in northern Arizona.  
 
The following were the main objectives of this research: 
1) Determine through a systematic review process the effect of removing trees on the 
water budget, including surface water runoff, groundwater recharge, soil moisture 
storage, transpiration, evaporation and sublimation, 
2) Conduct five model simulations of the NARGFM from 2006 to 2099 based on the 
interaction of 4FRI alternative C and downscaled precipitation estimates from the 
multi-model ensemble and three of the IPCC climate scenarios A1B, A2, and B1, 
and based on extending the sixth (1940-1949) and tenth (2000-2005) stress 
periods in the published NARGFM into the future (to 2099) for comparison.  
3) Make recommendations to Salt River Project on the responses of the watersheds 
which supply their water supplies following the 4FRI treatments.

1.4 STUDY AREA 
 
The study area encompasses over 30,000 square miles and is located in northern 
Arizona and adjacent parts of western New Mexico and southern Utah (Figure 2). This 
area has an arid to semi-arid climate and temperature and precipitation in the study area 
vary considerably spatially and temporally. Lower altitudes have extremely hot summers 
but mild winters, while higher altitudes have moderate summers and severe winters. 
Precipitation varies; basins receive 10 to 15 inches per year, surrounding mountain slopes 
receive 15 to 30 inches per year, and the mountains and Coconino Plateau receive 20 to 
40 inches per year (Blasch et al., 2006). However, only about 10% of the annual 
precipitation in the area is recovered and used by people; the other 90% is lost to 
evapotranspiration (Ffolliott and Baker, 2000). Winter snowfall accounts for 
approximately 60% of annual precipitation but is responsible for 80-95% of streamflow 
(Baker, 2003) and almost all recharge (Blasch et al., 2006). Elevation ranges from 
approximately 750 to 800 feet in the lowest reaches of the Colorado River, to 12,633 feet 
at Humphreys Peak, the highest natural point in Arizona.  
 
Included in the study area are parts of four national forests: the Apache-
Sitgreaves, Coconino, Kaibab, and Tonto National Forests, which comprise 
approximately 2.4 million acres of federal forest land. These forests are mostly located 
between the elevations of 6000 and 8000 feet, receive an annual average of 20 to 30 
inches of precipitation per year as roughly equal proportions of summer monsoon rains 
and winter snowfall, and include predominately ponderosa pine trees as well as alligator 
juniper, quaking aspen, and other mixed conifer species. The remainder of the model 

12 
 
domain includes a wide variety of ecosystems including riparian/wetland vegetation, 
grassland, and desert scrub (Figure 2).   
 
Major rivers in the study area include the Colorado, Little Colorado, Verde, and 
Salt Rivers, and their associated tributaries. These major rivers are supported by a 
number of perennial streams and springs, as well as intermittent, or ephemeral, streams 
and springs that feed into them on either a regular (seasonal) or irregular (event-based) 
basis. Major springs included in the study area include Blue, Del Rio, and Havasu 
springs, as well as Verde headwater springs and springs adjacent to Verde tributaries, and 
springs that discharge to the Colorado River. There are a number of other surface water 
bodies included in the study area, such as springs and lakes that are not modeled in the 
Northern Arizona Regional Groundwater Flow-Model, either due to lack of data or the 
inability of the model to simulate at those resolutions.  
 
1.4.1 GEOLOGIC SETTING 
 
The study area is predominately located in the Colorado Plateau Structural 
Province and Transition Zone, with smaller parts located in the Basin and Range 
Structural Province. These provinces contain a number of similar geologic units that have 
a different structural history (Figure 3). The Colorado Plateau is an area of uplifted 
sedimentary rock, underlain by basement rock and overlain by relatively young volcanic 
deposits and unconsolidated sediments. Proterozoic basement rocks include granite, 
metamorphic rocks, and Grand Canyon Super Group rocks. Basement rocks underlay 
younger units and are exposed in the Grand Canyon, Big and Little Chino Valleys, Verde 
Valley, Mazatzal Mountains, Bradshaw Mountains, and Sierra Ancha Mountains.  

13 
 
 
Figure 3. Generalized stratigraphic cross section of rock units located within 
physiographic provinces of the Northern Arizona Regional Groundwater-Flow Model 
study area (from Pool et al., 2011). 
 
 
 
The sedimentary rocks include Phanerozoic sandstone, conglomerate, siltstone, 
mudstone, shale, limestone and dolomite units. Paleozoic rocks included Cambrian 

14 
 
(Tapeats Sandstone) to Permian (Kaibab Limestone) sedimentary rocks. These units dip 
approximately 2 degrees southwest, thicken westward, and are characterized by east-to-
west facies changes. These rocks underlie most of the study area and are exposed along 
the Mogollon Rim and in canyons of the Colorado River. The Redwall Limestone, Martin 
Formation, and Muav Limestone are all units of the Redwall-Muav Aquifer, an important 
source of groundwater for much of the northern part of the state. Additionally, the Middle 
Supai through Kaibab Formations are important units that make up the Coconino 
Aquifer. 
 
Mesozoic Rocks include mostly the Triassic Moenkopi formation and younger 
unconsolidated sediments. The Moenkopi formation has a low permeability and serves as 
the confining unit for the Coconino Aquifer below, as well as some of the alluvial basin-
fill aquifers above. Overlying sediments have good permeability and form disconnected 
aquifers throughout the study area. However, these aquifers were not included in the 
model domain and are therefore not important for this study. These units have undergone 
consider structural disturbance and are therefore highly deformed and regionally 
discontinuous at the present time. Many of the sediments produced from this disturbance 
were later deposited in the basins located in the study area. These sediments include sand 
and gravels deposits at basin boundaries and silt, clay, and evaporates deposited in the 
basin center. These latter sediments often act as a confining unit to the basin-fill aquifers 
made up of the sand and gravel units. Some basins may have volcanic deposits 
interbedded with the basin-fill deposits. These volcanic units may form locally important 
zones of high permeability.

The structural history of the study area is complex. Major structural events 
include the Grand Canyon Orogeny, the Laramide Orogeny, and the basin and range 
structural disturbance. The Grand Canyon Orogeny was an event that occurred 
approximately 830 Ma (Elston, 1979). This orogeny significantly tilted, folded, and 
faulted members of the Grand Canyon Supergroup and marked the end of deposition of 
what would become the pre-Camrbian rocks of the region. After these events there was a 
relatively long period of erosion until the deposition of the Tapeats Sandstone and 
associated units over the now tilted Grand Canyon Supergroup and exposed basement 
rocks 460 million years later. These events created the iconic angular unconformity found 
two-thirds of the way down the Grand Canyon. 
 
The Laramide Orogeny was a compressional event that occurred between 75 and 
35 Ma that was largely responsible for the uplift of both the Rocky Mountains and the 
Colorado Plateau. This event lifted a large block of relatively horizontal sedimentary 
strata in the study area and surrounding area approximately 10,000 feet. The Laramide 
Orogeny was also responsible for a period of increased erosion that stripped most of the 
Colorado Plateau of its Mesozoic units (Pool et al., 2011). This event produced the 
regional 1 to 2 degree dip characteristic of the Colorado Plateau and resulted in the 
formation major features such as the Kaibab Uplift, Mesa Butte Fault, and Black Mesa 
Basin. The Mogollon Rim, where a majority of the 4FRI treatments are planned, is the 
erosional edge of the Colorado Plateau and marks the onset of the Transition Zone from 
plateau to basin and range.  
 
The basin and range structural disturbance was an event that occurred during the 
middle Tertiary, roughly 10-17 Ma (Eaton, 1982). This marked the change from 

16 
 
compressional stresses of the Laramide Orogeny to extensional stresses associated with 
basin and range formation. This event was characterized by normal faulting that created 
alternating series of horsts and grabens – basins and ranges – all the way from southern 
Oregon to northwestern Mexico, including major extension in southern Arizona, Utah, 
and eastern California (Eaton, 1982). This established a number of north-northwest 
trending valleys in the study area including Big Chino Valley, Williamson Valley, Little 
Chino Valley, Verde Valley, and Tonto Creek Basin, all of which were created by 
extensional faulting (Pool et al., 2011). Basin-fill sediments associated with this 
disturbance constitute the primary water bearing units of the basin-fill aquifers. 
 
A final major event – the establishment of the Colorado River in the Grand 
Canyon by 9 to 6 Ma – created the heavily dissected landscape of northern Arizona 
including the Grand Canyon, where over a mile of down cutting has occurred (Pool et al., 
2011). This rapid erosion has dewatered regional aquifers in the area, significantly 
altering the associated groundwater flow systems. This has led to the establishment of 
several major springs in the area, the most prominent of which is Havasu Spring in 
western Grand Canyon. These springs are important to communities in the region, 
especially the Havasupai tribe living at the bottom of the Grand Canyon at Havasu Creek, 
northwest of Grand Canyon Village. 
 
1.4.2 GENERAL HYDROGEOLOGY 
 
The major aquifers in the study area include the Redwall-Muav (R-aquifer), 
Coconino (C-aquifer), and basin-fill aquifers (Pool et al., 2011). The R- and C-aquifers 
have groundwater divides that are largely coincident with the Mogollon Rim and trend 

17 
 
northwest-southeast. This divides the regional flow systems into two parts: one part flows 
northward into the Colorado and Little Colorado Rivers and one part flows south to the 
Verde and Salt Rivers. The focus of this thesis is on the flow system in and around the 
Verde River groundwater catchment basin as simulated by the NARGFM. There are a 
number of smaller aquifers that are not as important regionally but are used extensively to 
meet local demand. Some of these local aquifers include Quaternary alluvial aquifers and 
the Payson Granite, which are connected to the regional aquifers, and smaller 
disconnected aquifers in the alluvium, volcanic rocks, Kaibab Formation, Coconino 
Sandstone, Supai Group, and Proterozoic rocks. These minor aquifers were included in 
the model because of their ability to transmit water to the regional aquifers via 
percolation after discharging.  Regional recharge in the study area is estimated to be 
approximately 4% of annual precipitation and as high as 8% along the Mogollon (Parker, 
2005).  
 
The R-aquifer is the deepest aquifer in the study and comprises the Tapeats 
Sandstone, Bright Angel Shale, Muav Limestone, Temple Butte Limestone, and Redwall 
Limestone (Pool et al., 2011). Some portions of this layer also include lower parts of the 
Supai Formation, Naco Formation, or Surprise Canyon Formation, all of which form an 
upper confining unit. Minor stratigraphic variations can be found throughout the study 
area. The Redwall and Muav Limestones are the main water-bearing units of the R-
aquifer (Bills et al., 2007). The aquifer is underlain and confined by Proterozoic basement 
rock. The units of the R-aquifer are exposed in the northern, southern, and western 
portions of the study area in steep canyons and escarpments (Pool et al., 2011). Most of 
the R-aquifer is overlain by younger units and is usually found at considerable depth, 

18 
 
often exceeding 3000 feet (Bills et al., 2000). The units of the R-aquifer underlie most of 
the study area, with the exception of Little Chino sub-basin, and therefore make up most 
of model layer 3 of the NARGFM. Recharge to the aquifer occurs mainly through 
downward leakage from overlying, fractured units of the C-aquifer and from direct 
infiltration where the units of the R-aquifer are exposed, mostly south of the Mogollon 
Rim (Pool et al., 2011). Recharge can also occur through percolation through 
unconsolidated alluvium and porous volcanic rocks that are associated with faulting and 
fracturing. Underflow may also contribute groundwater flow to the aquifer, mostly from 
the Little Colorado River Plateau, but higher elevations and faulting through the R-
aquifer prohibit underflow from surrounding areas. The R-aquifer discharges mainly as 
spring flow to the Colorado, Little Colorado, and Verde River and their tributaries, as 
underflow to basin-fill aquifers in Little Chino Valley and Big Chino Valley, as discharge 
from wells, and as ET where the water table is at our near land surface. 
 
The C-aquifer lies above the R-aquifer and comprises the Kaibab Formation, 
Coconino Sandstone, Schnebly Hill Formation, and Upper Supai Formation (Pool et al., 
2011). Minor stratigraphic variations can be found throughout the study area. The top of 
the aquifer, the Kaibab Limestone, is typically unsaturated but provides a conduit for 
infiltration into the units below. The Coconino Sandstone is the main water-bearing unit 
of the C-aquifer (Hart, 2002). The aquifer is confined below by the Lower Supai 
Formation. The units of the C-aquifer crop out in the western, southwestern, and 
northeastern parts of the study area. In other areas, the aquifer is overlain by younger 
units and can be found at considerable depth, often exceeding 1000 feet (Bills et al., 
2000). The C-aquifer extends throughout approximately half of the study area, making up 

19 
 
half of model layer 1 of the NARGFM. Recharge to the aquifer occurs mainly by direct 
infiltration from runoff through the Kaibab Limestone and by percolation from fractured 
volcanic rocks and overlying perched zones (Hart, 2002). This occurs predominately in 
the southern and western edges of the study area, and in the northeastern edge of the 
study area on the Defiance Uplift. Groundwater discharges from the C-aquifer as spring 
discharge to the Little Colorado and Verde River drainage systems, downward leakage to 
the R-aquifer, flow to streams in the Little Colorado River basin, and ET where the water 
table is at or near land surface.  
 
The alluvial basin-fill aquifers found throughout the study area include Big Chino 
Valley and Williamson Valley, Little Chino Valley and Lonesome Valley, Upper Agua 
Fria Basin, Verde Valley, and Tonto Creek Basin (Pool et al., 2011). These aquifers are 
associated with the basin and range physiography characteristic of the Transition Zone 
and comprise upper and lower layers, a coarse- and fine-grained facies, and interbedded 
basalt flows.  As described earlier, these valleys trend north-northwest. The coarse-
grained facies are found at the basin boundaries and the fine-grained facies are found in 
the basin center. Generally, the basin boundaries are unconfined while the centers are 
confined. Furthermore, the upper basin fill facies are usually more permeable than the 
lower basin fill facies. Interbedded basalt flows are generally poor aquifers but are 
associated with zones of high permeability in the upper basin fill in the Paulden area of 
the Big Chino Basin and the lower basin fill in the Little Chino Basin. Local perched 
aquifers are associated with quaternary flood-plain alluvium that overlies low 
permeability rocks or fine-grained facies at basin centers. These basin-fill aquifers are 
generally a few hundred feet thick but thicknesses exceed a thousand feet in some 

20 
 
locations, such as the Big Chino Valley where the maximum recorded thickness of the 
basin is 1800 feet (Blasch et al., 2006). The basin-fill aquifers, their upper and lower 
layers, and the associated volcanic deposits cover approximately half of model layers 1 
and 2 and are important mainly in the southern and western parts of the study area. 
Recharge to these aquifers occurs mainly through percolation through fractured Paleozoic 
rocks associated with areas of high elevation, through ephemeral stream channel allvium, 
and from underflow from the R-aquifer. Groundwater discharges in different places 
depending on the aquifer but, generally, groundwater discharges as underflow to other 
basin-fill aquifers, underflow to the R- and C-aquifers, discharge to wells, discharge to 
streams and springs, and as ET where the water table is at or near land surface and 
phreatophytes have access to the shallow water table (Pool et al., 2011).

CHAPTER 2 – SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF FOREST TREATMENT EFFECTS 
ON WATERSHED BUDGETS – IMPLICATIONS FOR SURFACE WATER AND 
GROUNDWATER

2.1 ABSTRACT 
A systematic review was conducted to examine the state of knowledge of forest 
restoration thinning and its hydrological responses and to evaluate the quality and type of 
references that exist within the literature. Two questions guided the systematic review: 1) 
how do restoration thinning treatments conducted on conifer-dominated watersheds affect 
the water budget? And, 2) how do restoration thinning treatments impact the groundwater 
system? A total of 37 references met the systematic review criteria and were considered 
appropriate for answering these two questions. Data from individual studies suggested 
that forest treatments that reduce tree density, increase water yield and groundwater 
recharge while reducing evapotranspiration. Specifically, when 20-100% of a conifer-
dominated watershed was treated, the literature shows a corresponding 0-40% increase in 
water yield. Although most studies showed an increase in groundwater table height 
following tree removal, there was no overall correlation for all studies between percent 
area treated and groundwater recharge. Results are highly variable, and diminish within 
five to ten years for water yield increases and even quicker (< 4 years) for groundwater 
table heights.  
 
 
2.2 BACKGROUND 
The purpose of this systematic review was to examine forest restoration thinning 
treatments on conifer-dominated forested catchments and their effects on watershed 
hydrology, as well as the broader issue of the impacts of changing forest cover on 
groundwater recharge. Pre-European-settlement forest structures in the southwestern 
United States (Arizona, New Mexico, and adjacent parts of Utah and Colorado) have 

22 
 
been significantly altered from these previous conditions by old-growth logging, fire 
suppression, cattle grazing, and road building (Covington, 2003). This has increased the 
density of younger trees and forest underbrush providing fuel to alter regular, low-
intensity fire regimes and produce devastating crown fires (Harrington and Sackett, 
1990).  
To minimize the likelihood of large-scale crown fires throughout the southwestern 
U.S., the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), with assistance from collaborators, is planning to 
restore these at-risk forests to increase forest resiliency and function and reduce the threat 
of catastrophic wildfires. This project, called the Four Forest Restoration Initiative 
(4FRI), is a collaborative effort to reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfires and restore 
forest ecosystem health throughout four national forests along the Mogollon Rim, 
Arizona (Draft EIS Chapter 1, 2012). The initial treatments will include mechanical 
thinning and burning and will be applied to about 2400 km2 (600,000 acres) of Kaibab 
and Coconino National Forest lands as early as 2014, pending approval of the 
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Subsequent treatments will treat at-risk areas on 
the Coconino, Tonto and Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests.  
An important issue the 4FRI addresses is how changing forest cover affects 
watershed hydrology. A number of studies have attempted to answer this question 
(Hibbert, 1967; Bosch and Hewlett 1982; Stednick, 1996; Brown et. al., 2005; Zou et. al., 
2010). Based on these previous studies, the expected outcome of the 4FRI treatments is 
an overall increase in surface-water runoff and groundwater recharge on the treated 
watersheds. A simple relationship was reported by Baker (2003) as: when there is a 30 to 
100 % reduction in basal-area reduction in semi-arid, Ponderosa pine watersheds there is 

23 
 
a 15 to 40 % increase in water yield. This goal of this review was to identify this 
relationship in the literature and any relationship that might exist between tree removal 
and groundwater.  
 
2.3 OBJECTIVES  
The objectives of this systematic review were: 
1) Design and conduct a systematic review of all relevant literature relating to 
the removal of trees and the effects this has on the water budget following the 
guidelines suggested by the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE, 
2010); 
2) Determine the quality of evidence for collected literature; 
3) Quantify the relationship between variables in water budget and tree removal; 
4) Determine if this relationship is significant; and 
5) Determine how applicable these results are to proposed 4FRI treatments. 
 
2.4 METHODOLOGY 
We hypothesized that a significant number of references examining the effects of 
forest restoration thinning on watershed hydrology existed to undertake a systematic 
review following the guidelines of the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE, 
2010). Because this systematic review is targeted at providing reliable data for the 4FRI, 
we tailored our question so that only the most relevant studies would be collected. We 
formulated the following questions: 1) how do restoration thinning treatments conducted 

24 
 
on conifer-dominated watersheds affect the water budget? And, 2) how do restoration 
thinning treatments impact the groundwater system? We determined this question was 
specific enough because it would  give us results that are reliable and useful and broad 
enough that it would capture any references that may have been marginalized with more 
specific interventions (e.g. “treatment” instead of “restoration” or “harvest”) and forest 
type (e.g. “conifer” instead of “ponderosa pine” or “Douglas-Fir"). 
Two appropriate reference search strategies were developed based on the above 
questions and following the systematic review procedures as defined by Collaboration for 
Environmental Evidence (CEE, 2010). These included relevant search terms and 
combinations of these terms. A number of publication types and research databases were 
used for this search including peer reviewed articles, dissertations and theses, and books. 
We used search engines that were considered adequate for finding these references, 
including Web of Knowledge, Proquest Dissertations and Theses, and World Cat, 
respectively. Gray literature was also used as a source of data and found with various 
popular search engines.  
 
Study inclusion criteria included the most relevant information for answering each 
of the two questions. If the title appeared to include relevant criteria the reference was 
kept for further review. Abstracts were then reviewed to further constrain the studies 
meeting the inclusion criteria and filter out those that did not. Criteria included variables 
like forest type, climate, type of intervention, water budget variables measured, and 
quality of study. A kappa analysis, a statistical technique used to test inter-rater 
agreement for qualitative items, was used to test reviewer agreement when conducting 

25 
 
the abstract review stage (Carletta, 1996) (see Appendix B). The studies that passed the 
abstract review stage were kept for full text review. 
A modified version of Pullin and Knight’s (2003) hierarchy of evidence quality 
(HEQ) was used to determine which studies reported reliable and strong evidence, which 
studies were considered with caution, and which studies’ data were excluded due to lack 
of strong evidence (Table 1). Each study that passed the title and abstract review stage 
and underwent a full text review was assigned to one of these categories. These 
categories were designed to rate the studies with respect to their relevance in answering 
the two questions.

Relevant data were extracted and recorded on a master spreadsheet during full 
text review (see Appendices C and D). Relevant data included author, year, location, 
climate, forest type, soil, mean annual precipitation, treatment type, percent of area 

26 
 
treated, and observed effects. This information was then used to determine the quality of 
evidence and apply a category to each reference. This category reflects the relative 
usefulness and reliability of each study in answering the systematic review questions. 
Additional information and tables relating to methodology are provided as supporting 
material. 
 
2.5 RESULTS 
 
Over 2,000 references were reviewed to find relevant studies that would help to 
answer the systematic review questions (Table 2).

Description of Studies 
 
After quality of evidence elimination, there were 80 studies remaining. 37 of these 
were original research papers and were used in this review (Figure 4). The types of

included in this review. Numbers correspond to identification numbers (see Appendices C and D). 
Studies not shown include those located in China, Japan, and Australia.  

 
28 
 
 studies included peer-reviewed journal articles as well as technical reports, dissertations, 
and popular literature articles. Two papers that passed the abstract review were rejected 
during the full-text review. Two more papers were rejected during the quality of evidence 
review. As mentioned, 37 studies were original research. The remaining 43 studies were 
summary articles.  
 
There were three types of summary articles found. The first type was the 
quantitative review which reviewed a large number of studies and used tables to 
summarize those studies, usually listing important details such as reference, location, 
area, elevation, aspect, vegetation, mean annual precipitation, mean annual streamflow, 
% area cut, and water yield increase (mm). The second type of review was the qualitative 
review that reviewed data from previous studies to draw general conclusions about forest 
treatment effects on the water budget. The third type of review was the single-study 
review where previous experiments were re-visited but no new data were collected. All 
three types were included past the initial review stages for reference.  
 
Experimental studies comprised 37 of the references that were reviewed.   
Results from 23 studies were used to answer question #1: How do restoration thinning 
treatments conducted on conifer-dominated watersheds affect the water budget? Results 
from fifteen studies were used to answer question #2: How do restoration thinning 
treatments impact the groundwater system? One study (Rockefeller, 2004) was included 
in both. Of these 37 studies, 31 were peer-reviewed journal articles, five were project or 
technical reports from an academic institution or public institution, and one was a 
dissertation. Thirty five were assigned to quality of evidence category II-1 and the other 
two were assigned to quality of evidence category II-3 because of their short post-

 
29 
 
treatment observation period (less than 1 year) (see Appendix C and D). Data were 
plotted to visualize any relationships that might exist between mean annual precipitation 
(MAF), percent area cut, water yield increase, and groundwater levels (Figures 5-8).

The results from the semi-arid watershed studies reported increased surface-water 
yields ranging from 14.7 mm to 98 mm following treatments. This is close to the 25 mm 
to 75 mm range cited in earlier reviews (Bosch and Hewlett, 1982 and Stednick, 1996). 
Only one semi-arid study reported results that were not significant (Troendle and King, 
1987). Common reasons given for an increase in water yield were an overall reduction in 

 
34 
 
evapotranspiration (ET) and interception and increase in snowpack accumulation. A 
reduction in ET following treatment is supported by a study that measured ET using the 
tower-based eddy covariance approach (Kolb, 2009). Though data were collected for 
only two years, there was a 17% reduction in ET for the first year and a 15% reduction in 
ET in the second year. An increase in snowpack accumulation is supported by a paper 
that looked at reduced interception and a redistribution of snow following forest 
restoration treatments (Stegman, 1996). Groundwater recharge was not measured or 
analyzed by any of the studies in semi-arid areas.   
 
The continental-maritime studies reported observed water yield increases ranging 
from 6 mm to 578 mm with an average response of 210 mm for all studies. The main 
reason given for increases in water yield was similar to those reasons given in the semi-
arid studies: a reduction in ET and interception and an increase in snowpack 
accumulation or rain availability. Results from three studies were not significant; the 
reason given was because of the natural variability in precipitation and runoff. One study 
reported calculated ET reduction using the water budget method (Hubbart, 2007). The 
authors reported a 35% reduction in ET on one watershed and a 14% reduction on 
another. Another study reported a 6% to 107% increase in water-table elevations 
following treatments (Rockefeller, 2004). All results were highly dependent on 
precipitation.  
 
The groundwater studies that were reviewed came from low-elevation locations 
around the world. Because of the variety of climates, elevations, and precipitation 
regimes, the forest and soil type was variable. Most treatments were clear-cuts with only 
two instances of selective cutting. Study area size ranged from 0.052 ha to 350 ha and an 

 
35 
 
average water table depth from 0.3 meters to 25 meters. All but two studies produced 
significant results that were attributed to forest treatments. One non-response study 
attributed this to low precipitation and another, where a shallow cave system was 
instrumented, concluded that secondary recharge via fracture flow was not affected by 
treatment (Bazan et al., 2012). Generally, relationships weren’t significant for the 
groundwater studies taken together (Figure 8). Studies that observed results observed 
increases in the water table ranging from 22 mm 2150 mm and an increase in 
groundwater recharge rates, where measured, ranging from 10 mm to 60 mm. All data 
extracted from all references are collected in Appendices C and D.  
 
Generally, reported annual mean water yield increases were used to generate a 
response time-graph where comprehensive annual data was available (Figure 9). This 
shows a diminishment of treatment effects over time for each study-watershed that was 
graphed, with effects becoming negligible between 4-10 years after forest restoration for 
both semi-arid and maritime/continental region types. 
 
2.6 DISCUSSION  
 
The studies examined in this review included a variety of forest treatments with 
clear-cutting being by far the most common, being used exclusively or with other 
treatment types in 26 of the 37 studies. Other treatments included single-cuts, patch-cuts, 
group-cuts, thinning methods, conversion to grassland, shelterwood-cuts, alternative-cuts, 
overstory removal, partial-cuts, strip-cuts, selective-cuts, and other techniques like 
specific tree type removal (Cypress-cuts and hand-removing Alligator Juniper) and 
various forms of light and heavy disturbances. This wide application of different forest 

 
36 
 
treatments within and across studies made it difficult to draw conclusions that would be 
applicable to the 4FRI treatments.  
 
2.6.1 Question #1 
 
How do restoration thinning treatments conducted on conifer-dominated 
watersheds affect the water budget?  
 
Analyses of results from the 23 collected studies demonstrated several important 
lessons. First, there were relatively few studies that examined restoration thinning and the 
resulting effects on the entire water budget. Furthermore, only three of the 23 studies 
found in this systematic review used a thinning method to treat their watersheds. Most of 
the studies used clear-cuts, as well as strip-cuts, group-cuts, patch-cuts, and variety of 
other methods. This had important implications for answering Question #1. Another 
lesson was that regardless of treatment type or the percent of the watershed treated, there 
was usually an increase in water yield following treatment. Only rarely were non-
significant results reported. Roughly, water yield increased between 0-40% percent when 
20-100% of a conifer-dominated watershed was treated, with slightly higher yields for 
semi-arid regions (Figure 6). Only a few studies lie outside this range. This value is 
comparable to the value reported by Baker (2003) where water yield increases of 15-40% 
were observed when reducing basal area by 30-100% on a ponderosa pine watershed. 
While area treated and basal area reductions are not exactly correlative, the data show a 
trend of increasing water yield with increasing the area of a watershed that is treated.  
 
The most common reasons given for these responses were a decrease in 
evapotranspiration and increased snowpack accumulation (Kolb, 2009 and Stegman, 

 
37 
 
1996). The data presented here answer question #1: forest treatments on conifer-
dominated watersheds can alter water yield. Treatments that remove trees have the 
potential to increase annual water yields depending on the intensity and type of treatment. 
The effect of increase water yields diminish rapidly, however, usually between 4-10 years 
after forest restoration. This is attributed to the regrowth of underbrush and new forest 
stands that occurs when there are no measures taken to maintain post-treatment 
conditions. 
 
2.6.2 Question #2 
 
How do restoration thinning treatments impact the groundwater system?  
 
Summaries of the results from the 15 studies to answer question #2 indicated that 
the data were insufficient to answer the question. Similar to the results for the first 
question, most of these studies used clear-cutting to treat the watersheds, with only one 
study using a thinning treatment (Shanley, 1995). A correlation between percent area 
treated and change in groundwater table level cannot be established because the 
relationship was not considered significant (Figure 8). Only three of the 15 studies 
reported non-significant results, with one of those reporting significant results on other 
experimental watersheds within the same study. Because 12 of 15 studies reported an 
increase in groundwater level following tree removal, it was considered probable that 
when forested watersheds have trees removed, an increase in the groundwater table level, 
and thus groundwater recharge, is possible. No other significant hydrologic response was 
deemed supported by the available data.  

 
38 
 
 
The lack of correlation between the two variables was attributed to the wide 
variety of climates, precipitation regimes, forest types, soil types, and treatment types 
used in all studies. Groundwater response is largely attributed to a reduction in 
evapotranspiration and canopy interception. These reductions allowed more of the 
precipitation to reach the soil surface and thus infiltrate increasing soil moisture storage. 
Once precipitation falls on the thinned forest, less trees means less water is used from soil 
water storage and more is available for recharge (Bazan et al., 2012). Most hydrological 
responses, while positive, diminished rapidly. One study found increasing groundwater 
levels immediately returning to normal after four months (Bliss and Comerford, 2002) 
while another study recorded significant responses for four years (Borg et al., 1987). This 
indicates that responses can be both immediate and intense but short-lived and 
unsustainable if watersheds are allowed to naturally regenerate or are re-vegetated. These 
results are similar to those found by Sun et al. (2001) in a review that summarized the 
studies of treatments effects on the hydrologic system in the wetland forests of the 
southern United States.    
 
2.6.3 Implications for 4FRI 
 
It was unclear how significant the surface water and groundwater results were to 
estimate the impact of the 4FRI treatments on the water balance. As stated, the restoration 
thinning treatments that will be used in 4FRI are different from those used in the studies 
collected in this systematic review. The authors conclude that it is probable that an 
increase in water yield will accompany the proposed thinning treatments conducted on 
the 4FRI area. The results are expected to be variable. The results of the groundwater 

 
39 
 
studies were not considered meaningfully significant or useful for answering any 
questions 4FRI might have about forest treatments and groundwater recharge. The studies 
reviewed by the researchers were located in low elevations and wet climates with shallow 
water tables and forest types mostly comprised of either eucalyptus or conifer species. In 
contrast, the 4FRI treated will be on ponderosa pine dominated watersheds in a semi-arid 
climate with basalt-derived soils at elevations of 1828-2438 m [6000-8000 feet] that 
provide recharge to deep aquifers (91-1100 m). Only one study reported using thinning as 
a treatment while the rest used various types of cuts, including mostly clear-cuts. In 
contrast, none of the 4FRI treatments will use clear-cutting. Intuitively one would expect 
that removing trees has the potential to increase groundwater recharge. However, any 
recharge to the local aquifers would take considerable time, possibly decades, to 
recognize because of the significant seasonal and annual variations in precipitation in this 
semi-arid climate. In addition, other factors may mask the effects of restoration thinning 
treatments, including variations in climate and groundwater pumping.  
 
2.6.4 Uncertainty and Error 
 
Some sources of error acknowledged by the researchers included but, were not 
limited to, publication bias, study errors, and poor systematic review methodology. There 
is a potential that publication bias could have contributed to the types of studies collected 
in this review. Only seven of the 37 studies reported non-significant results. Furthermore, 
two of these seven studies reported significant results on other experimental watersheds. 
There may have been other non-significant studies or studies that reported decreasing 
water yields following tree removal that were not published.  

 
40 
 
 
Study errors may have affected the data within this systematic review. It was 
outside the scope of this paper to analyze every method used within each study. Control-
watershed experiments were determined to be the most reliable method. This is an 
assumption made by the authors of this paper and reflected a methodological value 
judgment that may have biased the types of experiments collected in this review. It was 
unclear how many possibly sources of error there could be within and between all studies 
collected in this systematic review.  It was assumed that most of these errors were 
excluded during the peer-review process.  
 
A final source of error considered was poor systematic review methodology. The 
purpose of this systematic review was to collect references in a systematic, standardized 
way to minimize publication and author bias and make the review process as rigorous, 
transparent, and well-defined as possible. While the objectives of this review were 
relatively constrained, it was not possible to eliminate all bias, error, or uncertainty when 
conducting the stages of this systematic review. A few examples included a search 
strategy and study inclusion criteria that may have placed emphasis on journal 
publications over gray literature or an emphasis on studies reporting increased water yield 
over studies reporting non-significant results or decreased water yields. This may have 
led to the extraction of data that were not useful, the missing of significant data, and/or 
the reporting of results that that may have been inappropriate for the data collected.  
 
These sources of error and uncertainty were not considered limiting. However, it 
was considered appropriate to acknowledge these sources of error as well as the 
possibility of others because of the compounded uncertainty that may accrue from each 
error. This may have contributed to obscuring actual relationships or magnifying 

 
41 
 
perceived ones that therefore contributed to asserting a poorly supported, misleading, or 
even false conclusions. The results obtained from this systematic review are considered 
by the authors as reliable.  
 
 
2.6.5 Recommendations for Future Research 
 
It is unclear if additional research will significantly eliminate the uncertainties and 
variance found within water yield and groundwater studies or if there is an inherent 
structural limitation to how fine and conclusive the results drawn from them can be. The 
authors recommend several areas of future research that may better determine any 
possible relationships and minimize uncertainty.  
 
The development of a more systematized and structured approach to developing a 
controlled-watershed experiment, developing water and energy balances for the 
watershed, and reporting these variables will lead to more structured data sets that will be 
useful to compare across studies. This approach would facilitate data accumulation and 
manipulation as well as the ability to recognize relationships between studies, especially 
those with similar climates and forest types. The methods used in measuring variables 
and collecting data appear to be appropriate, but a more rigorous application of testing 
against the null hypothesis as well as the transparency of results and description of 
methods would help future researchers and decision-makers draw useful conclusions. 
Many of the studies found in this systematic review only reported mean annual results. 
Full disclosure of data and methods, while beyond the scope of most references collected, 
would have facilitated the recognition of any actual relationships and the drawing of 
conclusions from these data.  

 
42 
 
 
There was a lack of groundwater studies related to tree removal in semi-arid to 
arid locations. Groundwater studies have the potential to make significant contributions 
to the literature and the understanding of those dynamic systems. Measuring multiple 
water budget variables at different sites would contribute to reducing uncertainty when 
estimating these parameters and lead to greater likelihood of accurate results and 
predictions. Most of these studies looked at water yield or groundwater table height, but 
neglected other variables that are important to the water budget like evapotranspiration 
and soil water storage. A focus on measuring all water budget variables would reduce 
uncertainty and ambiguity in these types of studies and make useful contributions to 
accumulated data within and across studies.  
 
 A focus on restoration thinning treatments rather than harvesting would provide 
important information for the 4FRI. Because forest restoration projects focus on restoring 
forest health and resiliency, as well as stream, spring, and biologic function, the approach 
will not be like those used in the majority of the studies reviewed. Instead forest 
restoration studies would be geared towards creating a forest structure that is conducive 
to these functions. Any information on how restoration thinning treatments affect the 
water budget, as well as any other contributing factors, would be useful in the planning 
and adaptive management processes of these projects.  
 
2.7 CONCLUSIONS 
 
Numerous studies throughout the world have attempted to quantify the hydrologic 
effects of removing trees from forested watersheds. The reasons for these disturbances 
have been many, including timber harvest, tree stand improvement, deforestation, and 

 
43 
 
ecological restoration. There is an impetus for the restoration of catastrophic fire-prone 
forested watersheds, especially in the semi-arid southwestern United States. For example, 
the 4FRI restoration treatments will help minimize the threat of catastrophic wildfires 
while returning forests to a healthy condition. It is believed that improved forest health 
coincides with improved hydrologic conditions on these watersheds. This review 
summarized the state of knowledge with respect to forest harvest and treatments and their 
hydrologic effects. Generally, as conifer-dominated forested watersheds have their forest 
cover reduced there is an increase in the water yield from the watershed. When 20-100% 
of conifer-dominated watersheds were treated, there was an increase of 0-40% increase in 
water yields. Groundwater levels increased, but no relationships were significant. 
 
There have been very few forest treatment experiments on conifer-dominated 
watersheds that focused on the effects to groundwater levels.  For this reason, the authors 
include all studies that looked at the impact of tree removal on groundwater. Most effects 
on the groundwater system are variable and site-specific. A treatment that removes trees 
will, generally, result in increased groundwater recharge and groundwater levels. These 
effects are short lived and unsustainable unless it is the express intent of the agency to 
produce a sustainable increase. Otherwise, natural vegetation or replacing forest stands 
with agriculture causes diminishing returns that become negligible within just a few 
years.  
 
One of the knowledge gaps found in this review was the impact that restoration 
thinning treatments have on conifer-dominated watersheds in semi-arid climates. For 
instance, only one of the references studied groundwater and semi-arid conifer-dominated 
watersheds.  Understanding water balance changes due to semi-arid forest management is 

 
44 
 
vital to planned landscape-scale treatments on about one million acres of ponderosa pine 
watersheds throughout four national forests in Arizona. The implications from such 
studies would help to define expected hydrologic response to such treatments and could 
be used for different purposes, such as the development of adaptive management 
practices, projects to increase watershed function, or a payment for ecosystem services 
system to support forest restoration.

3.1 ABSTRACT 
 
 Previous studies have shown that in semi-arid, conifer-dominated watersheds 
there was a possibility to increase surface water yields 15-40% when basal area was 
reduced by 30-100%. The purpose of this study was to assess the impacts that proposed 
forest restoration treatments and climate change will have on large regional, deep, semi-
arid aquifers. We modeled how basal area reductions may result in increased 
groundwater recharge from historic conditions to 2099. Spatial analyses of proposed 
forest restoration treatments were conducted to determine areas and rates of potential 
increases in groundwater recharge. Changes in recharge were applied to the model by 
identifying zones of basal area reduction from forest restoration treatments and applying 
recharge-change factors to these zones. Over a ten-year period of forest restoration 
treatment, a 1% increase in annual recharge to regional aquifers was estimated compared 
to conditions that existed from 2000-2005. However, this increase was assumed to 
quickly decline after treatment due to regrowth of vegetation and forest underbrush. 
Furthermore, predicted groundwater recharge increases were masked by decreases in 
water levels, stream baseflow, and groundwater storage resulting from surface water 
diversions and groundwater pumping. These results showed that there is an imbalance 
between water supply and demand in northern Arizona, that current practices are not 
likely to be sustainable into the far future, and that comprehensive action should be taken 
to minimize this imbalance.  
 
3.2 INTRODUCTION 
 Landscape-scale forest restoration thinning and burning treatments are planned 
for approximately 243,000 ha (600,000 acres) of ponderosa pine forest within the 
Coconino and Kaibab National Forests along the Mogollon Rim in northern Arizona. 
This area has a semi-arid climate and receives 50-76 cm (20-30 in) of precipitation per 
year as summer monsoon rain and winter snow (Figure 10).  This area also has two deep 
(>300m) regional aquifers: the Redwall-Muav (R-) and Coconino (C-) aquifers. Basin-fill 

 
46 
 
aquifers also exist in the transition zone and basin and range provinces found in south 
central Arizona. 
 
 
Figure 10. Annual precipitation for Arizona Climatological Division #2 with 5- and 10-
year moving averages (NOAA, 2009). 
 
 
Restoration treatments are planned to begin within the next decade and are 
expected to take approximately ten years to complete (Draft EIS Chapter 1, 2012). The 

 
47 
 
purpose of this endeavor, called the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI), is to reduce 
the threat of catastrophic wildfire, restore forest health and resiliency, and restore 
streams, springs, and biologic functions of forested watersheds. Based on previous 
regional and international studies that show surface water yield increasing after similar 
reductions in tree basal area in forested lands (Bosch and Hewlett, 1982; Baker 2003), it 
was hypothesized that groundwater recharge would increase to both the deep regional 
Redwall-Muav and Coconino aquifers following forest restoration treatments. Through 
groundwater modeling and estimations of recharge effects as a result of changing forest 
cover and climate change, we assessed how this landscape-scale forest restoration may 
affect groundwater recharge along the Mogollon Rim, Arizona. 
 
3.3 PREVIOUS STUDIES 
 
Many previous studies have looked at the relationship between land use/land 
cover change and the hydrologic system. Specifically, researchers have attempted to 
quantify the effect that removing trees would have on the water budget. Most of these 
studies focused on the relationship between tree cover and surface water yield. Some 
studies have investigated arid and semi-arid conifer-dominated watersheds and have 
attempted to quantify the treatment/yield relationship. Baker (2003) reported that water 
yield increased by 15-40% when basal area was reduced by 30-100% in ponderosa pine 
watersheds in north central Arizona.  A systematic review of scientific papers from semi-
arid coniferous forests worldwide, which was conducted in conjunction with this study 
were similar, found  an average 0-40% increase in water yield when conifer basal area is 
reduced by 20-100% (Wyatt et al., in review, Chapter 2).  

 
48 
 
 
Fewer studies have attempted to quantify variables in the water budget other than 
surface water yield, such as evapostranspiration (ET), soil water storage, and 
groundwater recharge. A study by Kolb et al. (2009) reported a 17% and 15% reduction 
in ET in the first two years, respectively, following a 35% reduction in basal area in the 
Centennial Forest near Flagstaff, AZ. Other studies reported increases in snow pack 
accumulation following tree removal (Troendle and King, 1987 and Stegman, 1996). 
There have been even fewer studies that investigated the effect that removing trees has on 
groundwater recharge and soil moisture storage in arid and semi-arid forested watersheds 
(Bazan et al., 2012 and Scanlon et al., 2005). Because of the deficiency of published 
literature on the effects of tree removal on groundwater recharge, we used a groundwater 
model to understand how a large landscape-scale, forest restoration treatment might 
impact groundwater recharge.  
 
 
3.4 THE NORTHERN ARIZONA REGIONAL GROUNDWATER-FLOW MODEL 
  
The Northern Arizona Regional Groundwater-Flow Model (Pool et al. 2011), 
hereafter referred to as the NARGFM, was used in this study to simulate changes in 
recharge to aquifers of the Mogollon Rim in northern Arizona following planned forest 
restoration treatments. The NARGFM was developed using the three-dimensional finite-
difference modular groundwater-flow model code MODFLOW-2005 (Harbaugh, 2005). 
The model was originally developed to simulate the interactions between deep regional 
aquifers, streams, and springs in northern Arizona and to assess the adequacy of 
groundwater resources and to determine the effect that increased pumping, especially in 
the Verde River basin, would have on these resources.  

 
49 
 
 
The boundary conditions that were used for the model include surface watershed 
boundaries, groundwater basin divides, and low-permeability crystalline rocks along the 
southern boundary of the Verde River basin and adjacent sub-basins. By simulating a 
large region and defining known physical boundaries, defined major groundwater-flow 
divides within the model area were simulated rather than set at arbitrary locations. The 
entire boundary of the model was represented as a no-flow boundary except where 
groundwater outflow was simulated at discrete locations along streams. There was 
assumed to be no groundwater inflow anywhere along the model boundary.     
 
The NARGFM model grid comprises 600 rows, 400 columns, and three layers 
totaling 720,000 cells with grid cell dimensions of 1 km by 1 km (0.62 by 0.62 mi). The 
total domain size of the model is approximately 717,000 km2 (277,000 mi2). The model 
grid is rotated counterclockwise 60 degrees west of north to better align with regional 
structural trends that are assumed to influence groundwater flow. The NARGFM has 
three model layers that were used to represent hydrostratigraphic units within northern 
Arizona (Figure 11). Layer 3, the lowest layer, extends across the entire model area and 
represents the Redwall-Muav aquifer, except in the southern and eastern parts of the 
model domain where the Redwall-Muav aquifer is absent and crystalline rocks are 
present. Layer 2 is less extensive and represents the Supai Formation, a confining unit, 
which extends over most of the Colorado Plateau as well as sands and gravels in the 
Verde and Big Chino Valley extensional basins and the lower volcanic unit in Little 
Chino Valley and Upper Agua Fria sub-basins. Layer 1 is the least extensive layer within 
the model and represents the Coconino aquifer, the alluvial basin-fill aquifers located in 
Big Chino Valley, Little Chino Valley, and Agua Fria sub-basins, and the Verde 

 
50 
 
Formation in the Verde Valley.

geographic locations, hydrogeologic units, and model layers. Confining beds are shaded 
red-brown (Pool et al., 2011). 
 
 
Inflows and outflows were simulated at locations of natural and artificial 
recharge, evapotranspiration, streams, springs, and groundwater withdrawals. 
Hydrostratigraphic properties were distributed across the model domain, based on 
literature, and calibration values were applied where appropriate. These include variables 
such as hydraulic conductivity, transmissivity, anisotropy (vertical and horizontal), 
specific storage, and specific yield.     
 
The NARGFM simulates groundwater flow for steady-state conditions that were 
assumed to exist in 1910 and for transient conditions during 1910 to 2005 (Pool et al 
2011). Nine multi-year, transient stress periods were used during the simulation period. 
The initial period of simulation was the years 1910-1938 (10,227 days).  The second 
period simulated initial groundwater development in the Little Chino sub-basin for the 

 
51 
 
years 1938-1939. Thereafter, each stress period was approximately decadal in length 
(3652 to 3653 days), except for the last stress period which simulated the years 2000-
2005 (2192 days).  Each stress period was simulated using five time steps with each 
successive time-step length 1.2 times longer than the previous time-step length. The sixth 
(1940-1949) and tenth stress periods (2000-2005) of the published model were used as 
the historical and baseline scenarios, respectively, and were extended from 2006-2009. 
No changes were made to recharge, pumping, or any other variable. Stress periods were 
created for the end of the published transient model (2005) to the present (2006-2013), 
the assumed period of 4FRI treatment (2014-2023), and the end of each successive 
decade to 2099 (Table 3).

3.5 THE FOUR FOREST RESTORATION INITIATIVE 
The 4FRI, proposed by the U.S. Forest Service, is a collaborative effort to reduce 
the threat of catastrophic wildfires and restore forest ecosystem health throughout four 
national forests along the Mogollon Rim, Arizona – the Kaibab, Coconino, Tonto, and 

 
52 
 
Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests (Draft EIS Chapter 1, 2012). The initial treatments 
will include mechanical thinning and burning that will be applied to approximately 
243,000 ha (600,000 acres) of Kaibab and Coconino National Forest land as early as 
2014, pending approval of the Environmental Impact Statement. Treatments will target 
at-risk catastrophic wildfire areas.  
 
The 4FRI first analysis area EIS has four treatment alternatives.  Alternative A is 
the no action plan; Alternative B would thin 388,489 acres and burn 587,923 acres; 
Alternative C proposes the conservation of large trees and would thin 434,001 acres and 
burn 593,211 acres; Alternative D would reduce potential estimated fire emissions by 
thinning 388,439 acres and burning only 178,790 acres (Draft EIS Chapter 1, 2012). 
Alternative C was selected for the groundwater model simulations because it was one of 
two (B and C) that were considered likely to be implemented. Additionally, non-4FRI 
forest restoration treatments within these forests called shelf-stock were previously 
analyzed under separate NEPA processes.  These other non-4FRI treatments were taken 
into consideration for the model simulations reported here. There is considerable interest 
in how these treatments will impact area of high water use, such as the Verde Valley 
(Figure 12).

3.6 INCORPORATING CLIMATE CHANGE INTO MODEL SIMULATIONS 
 
 
This study used bias-corrected and downscaled climate projections derived from 
the World Climate Research Programme's (WCRP's) Coupled Model Intercomparison 
Project phase 3 (CMIP3) multi-model ensemble to provide estimates of future 
precipitation for the study area (Maurer et. al., 2007). The WCRP CMIP3 climate 
projections include a multi-model ensemble of results produced from 16 climate models 
that simulated three of the potential emission scenarios identified by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC, 
2007). The emission scenarios include the A1B, A2, and B1 scenarios. These scenarios 
are based on socio-economic changes that could occur in the future and their resulting 
impact on greenhouse gas emissions.  
 
A1B scenario represents an energy balance between fossil fuels and renewable 
energy and is assumed to result in a balance between hot and cold, and dry and wet 
conditions across the United States. The A2 scenario represents continued use of fossil 
fuels and assumed to result in more greenhouse gas emissions than currently projected, 
producing a warmer, drier climate. The B1 scenario represents an emphasis on renewable 
energy and other “green” technologies and is assumed to emit less greenhouse gas 
emissions, resulting in a recovering climate that is cooler and wetter over time compared 
to current conditions.  
 
3.7 OBJECTIVES 

 
55 
 
 
To determine the response of the regional Redwall-Muav and Coconino aquifers 
to the 4FRI treatments and climate change, the following objectives were designed for 
this study. 
1. Conduct five model simulations of the NARGFM from 2006 to 2099 for the 
interaction of 4FRI alternative C and downscaled precipitation estimates 
based on the multi-model ensemble and three of the IPCC climate scenarios 
A1B, A2, and B1, and based on extending the sixth (1940-1949) and tenth 
(2000-2005) stress periods in the published NARGFM into the future (2006-
2099) for comparison.  
2. Assess the impacts that forest restoration treatments and climate change may 
have on the groundwater budget of northern Arizona, with a focus on the 
Verde Valley groundwater catchment area and associated tributaries.  
3. Make recommendations to regional water use stakeholders on the responses of 
the watersheds which supply their surface water and groundwater supplies 
following the 4FRI treatments. 
3.8 METHODS 
 
A set of relatively novel methods were used for estimating changes in recharge 
from forest restoration treatments in this study. Because the NARGFM is a groundwater 
model, and therefore does not model surface vegetation or precipitation, the only 
hydrologic parameter in the model that was manipulated to simulate these changes was 
the recharge property. All other parameters including pumping and ET were kept at the 
same values that were used for the last time step of the published transient model, which 
covers the years 2000-2005. Other regional water supply studies have simulated changes 

 
56 
 
in pumping that may result with an increased population. This study did not change these 
variables because the purpose was to isolate the impact of forest treatments and climate 
change on groundwater recharge.  
 
Because of the relatively few studies that have quantified groundwater recharge 
following tree removal in semi-arid, conifer-dominated watersheds, the authors assumed 
that groundwater recharge responded in a similar way as literature documents runoff and 
streamflow responding after tree removal in these ecosystems. Specifically, when 
ponderosa pine tree basal area is reduced by 30-100%, surface water yield may increase 
15-40% (Baker, 2003).  Therefore, the assumption was made that as ponderosa pine basal 
area is reduced 30-100%, groundwater recharge may increase 15-40% 
 
Shapefiles containing all relevant data to 4FRI treatment scenario C were received 
from the GIS specialist for 4FRI (Mark Nigrelli, personal communication, 2012). These 
included information on pre-treatment and post-treatment basal area projections for forest 
stands within 4FRI treatment areas. Change in tree basal area was calculated by finding 
the percent difference between pre- and post-treatment basal area projections. This 
percent change was put into equation 1 as the independent variable.  
y = 0.357x + 4.29 
 
 
 
(equation 1) 
where 
x = percent basal area change 
y = percent increase in surface water yield 
This equation is the relationship between basal area reduction and water yield change 
described by Baker (2003). This percent change was applied to the groundwater model as 

 
57 
 
a factor of change in recharge based on zones of 10% change in basal area (eg. 30-40%, 
40-50%, etc). 
As an example of how the basal area change relationship was applied, areas that 
corresponded to a basal area reduction of approximately 30-39% (an average change of 
34.5%) were given 16% increase in recharge (y=1.16) (Table 4). Any treatments that 
reduced basal area by less than 30% were assumed to produce no discernible effect. This 
is supported by evidence found in Baker (2003) where was little to no discernible 
increase in water yield when basal area reduction in ponderosa pine forests was reduced 
by less than 30%. Additional forest restoration treatments other than 4FRI were simulated 
as well. These areas, labeled shelf-stock, include portions of the Coconino and Kaibab 
National Forests that were not included in the 4FRI assessment area but are currently 
undergoing forest restoration treatments or are planned to undergo treatment in the near 
future. Data received for these other forest treatment projects data did not consistently 
include  changes in basal area, so an assumption was made that these treatments would 
have similar proportions of treatment intensities (ie. basal area changes) as in 4FRI and 
would produce a similar hydrologic effect. This hydrologic effect was assumed to be 
equal to the average change in recharge from 4FRI.

*Zones were delineated based on each 10% reduction in basal area (BA), then averaged 
before calculating percent increase in groundwater recharge. Zone 11 corresponds to 
shelf-stock treatment areas where basal area reduction was assumed to be equal to the 
4FRI average. Factors were only applied to areas where 4FRI treatments are planned to 
occur. These factors were applied to stress period 12, or the years 2014-2023. 
 
 
To simulate changes in precipitation resulting from the A1B (moderate), A2 
(hotter and drier), and B1 (cooler and wetter) climate change scenarios, recharge-change 
factors were applied to the model (Table 5). These recharge factors were calculated by 
finding the difference between precipitation values for the PRISM projections used in last 
stress period of the NARGFM (the stress period 2000-2005 where precipitation and 
recharge were ~70% of 1971-2000 annual average) and the decadal mean projections of 
precipitation based on the downscaled CMIP3 climate projects over the period 2006-2099 
(2020-2029, 2030-2039…). Precipitation values were averaged over the model domain 
and the residual, or percent difference, between the data sets was calculated.  
To understand changes in recharge from forest restoration treatments and climate 
change the sixth (1940-1949) and tenth (2000-2005) stress periods of the published 
NARGFM were used to compare against. The recharge conditions for this period were 
held constant for the years 2006-2099. The years 1940-1949, our “Historical Scenario”, 
represent pre-development conditions, which were estimated to be close to annual 
average for the entire model period (1910-2005). This period was chosen because it 
represents average historical recharge conditions against which to compare. The years 
2000-2005, our “Baseline Scenario”, represent a relatively dry period in the historical 
record where precipitation and groundwater recharge was estimated to be 70% of the 
1971-2000 annual average. This period was chosen as our 2000-2005 scenario because 

 
59 
 
the recharge values for the years 2000-2005 were assumed to be similar to current 
conditions. Calibration for the years between the end of the published model simulation 
period (2005) and the beginning of this study (2012) were beyond the scope of this study.  
All spatial information was manipulated with ArcGIS 10.1 (ESRI, 2011). The 
NARGFM was simulated with MODFLOW 2005 (Harbaugh, 2005) using the  
Groundwater Vistas 6 user interface (Rumbaugh and Rumbaugh, 2012). All groundwater 
catchments basins for this research are delineated by model simulation and may not 
coincide with Arizona Department of Water Resources designations (Figure 12).

* These values were calculated based on changes from the NARGFM conditions that 
were simulated for the period of record 2000-2005. Note, this was a considerably dry 
period (see Figure 10) and therefore climate change precipitation projections generally 
show a recovery from these low conditions. 
 
3.9 RESULTS  
In the model, simulated 4FRI treatments from 2014-2023 resulted in an increase 
in groundwater recharge of approximately 4.6 x 107 m3 (38,000 acre-feet)  over three 
adjoining groundwater sub-basins: the Coconino Plateau, Little Colorado River, and 
Verde Valley sub-basins (Figure 13) following simulation of forest restoration 

 
60 
 
treatments. This was a 1% increase in annual recharge over baseline conditions that 
existed in 2000-2005 for the entire model domain. Out of this, there was approximately 
2.2 x 107 m3 (18,000 acre-feet) of additional recharge to the Verde Valley sub-basin or 
about 2.2 x 106 m3 (1,800) acre-feet of additional recharge per year over the ten year 
forest restoration treatment period. This was a 5% increase in annual recharge from 
baseline conditions for the Verde Valley. The additional 2.4 x 107 m3 (20,000 acre-feet) 
of water was recharged to the Coconino Plateau and Little Colorado Plateau sub-basins. 
Despite these increases, the historical scenario shows recharge conditions were 
significantly higher (>10,000 acre-feet per year) in the past.  
The A1B, A2, and B1 climate change scenario simulations estimated a slight 
recovery from 2000-2005 recharge conditions – estimated to be 70% of annual average – 
with the exception of the last stress period (2090-2099) of the A2 scenario where 
recharge was estimated to be 69% of historical annual average. The range of changes in 
recharge over all scenarios and stress periods was 69%-78% historical annual average 
with a continuing decline in recharge over time (Figure 13). So while the A1B, A2, and 
B1 climate scenarios all estimate recharge to exceed baseline recharge conditions (70% 
of historical annual average), they are still historically low and show that annual average 
recharge for the end of the simulation period (2099) for the A2 scenario will be as dry as 
the two driest periods in the previous 100 years (2000s and 1950s). 
 
Stream baseflow at USGS stream gaging stations in the Verde Valley sub-basin 
was evaluated to discern responses of the Verde River and its tributaries to forest 
restoration treatments and different climate change scenarios. Simulated baseflow

and 1.2 x 106 m3 (960 acre-feet) were observed on the Oak Creek near Sedona stream 
gage (Figure 14) and the Wet Beaver Creek near Rimrock stream gage, respectively. The 
A1B, A2, and B1 climate change scenarios predicted a slight increase in baseflow when 

 
65 
 
compared to the baseline scenario but, as noted above, decreases in baseflow when 
compared to the historical scenario. 
 
Water-level data at seven wells were selected to analyze groundwater response to 
forest restoration treatments and climate changes. These wells were pre-defined by Pool 
et al. (2011) as representative of the groundwater system in the Verde Valley sub-basin. 
These include five wells – (A-13- 05)05BDC, (A-14-05) 17AAC, (A-15-03)12ADB1, 
(A-15- 04)04DDC1, and (A-16-03)22DCD – that are in the confined part of the Verde 
Formation of the alluvial basin-fill aquifer and two wells—(A-17-06)E30BBB and (A-
14-10)32DBD – that are in the unconfined part of the Coconino aquifer. None of these 
wells were within the 4FRI treatment area but were assumed to show changes in the 
groundwater system that resulted from 4FRI treatments and climate changes (Figure 12). 
No long-term water-level data were available for the Redwall-Muav aquifer in the Verde 
Valley sub-basin (Pool et al., 2011).  
 
Well data from two confined alluvial basin-fill wells – (A-13-05)05BDC and (A-
14-05)17AAC – and one Coconino well aquifer well– (A-14-10)32DBD – are given 
(Figure 15). Well levels declined in all wells for the period of simulation 2006-2099, 
from a minimum of 2 feet ((A-13-05)05BDC) to a maximum of  >42 feet ((A-15-
03)12ADB1) when compared with the baseline scenario. The historical scenario 
estimated less drawdown and in one case (well (A-14-10)32DBD) predicted an increase 
in well water elevation if recharge conditions were to return to historical averages. Note, 
this done not take into account changes in pumping for the years 2005-2013, nor for 
changes that may exist from 2014-2099. 

 
66 
 
 
Storage change from 2000-2100 showed a continuing decline in groundwater 
storage for all scenarios (Figure 16). Blasch et al. (2006) estimates a change of -4.8 x 107 
m3 (39,000 acre-feet) for the Verde Valley sub-basin for the year 2005, the last year 
simulated by the NARGFM (Pool et al. 2011). The declining storage trend continued into 
the future and by 2099 produced a net change in storage that exceeded approximately -
3.7 x 109 m3 (-3,000,000 acre-feet) from pre-development conditions in 1910 the Verde 
Valley sub-basin under the baseline, A1B, and A2 climate change scenarios. The B1 
climate change scenario estimated a change of approximately -3.6 x 109 m3 (-2,900,000 
acre-feet) by the year 2099. The historical scenario estimated significantly less storage 
loss (2.9 x 109 m3 or 2,350,000 acre-feet) by 2099 when compared to the other scenarios.  
The rate of storage change for all scenarios decreased over time but was still high (ie. 
>29,000 acre-feet for the year 2100 for scenario B1 as compared with Blasch et al.’s 
figure of 39,000 for the year 2005).  
 
3.10 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
The variation in recharge detailed in Figure 13 has important implications for 
model simulation results. All three climate change projections considered in this study 
showed increases in recharge above that of the last stress period (2000-2005) but were 
still historically low. Despite the positive impact on recharge from 4FRI restoration 
treatments, increases in recharge were eclipsed by low precipitation projections (relative 
to historical averages), which were in turn eclipsed by increased groundwater 
withdrawals. A qualitative sensitivity analysis showed that the model was sensitive to 
changes in recharge from 4FRI and climate change scenarios. Based on model simulation 

 
67 
 
results, even with forest restoration impacts and precipitation recovery from 2000-2005 
conditions, recharge is likely to continue to decrease over time and deviate from 
historical averages. These decreases are attributed to there being less precipitation 
available than was historically available for groundwater recharge and groundwater 
overdrafting, or pumping more groundwater than naturally replenishes.  
 
Baseflow in Oak Creek, a tributary of the Verde River, through the USGS gage 
near Sedona, decreases for all simulated forest restoration treatments and climate change 
scenarios. While there is a small difference in baseflow by climate scenario – with the 
historical scenario providing the most baseflow and the baseline scenario providing the 
least – all simulated baseflow values are below annual average and continue to decrease 
over time. Blasch et al. (2006) reports that discharge upstream from the streamflow gages 
on the Verde River near Clarkdale and Camp Verde, Oak Creek near Sedona, and Wet 
Beaver Creek near Rimrock is likely sensitive to variations in recharge rates. However, 
even with increased recharge from forest restoration treatments and increased 
precipitation relative to 2000-2005, baseflow continued to decline into the future under 
current pumping conditions. Differences between baseflow projections for the four 
scenarios for the Verde River at Camp Verde were not considered significant because 
they were within the limits of error for baseflow estimations for the period of record 
1934-1945, 1988-2005. However, overall baseflow declines at this location exceeded this 
limit to error and are considered significant.  
 
The three wells given showed declining trends in water levels for all scenarios 
(Figure 15), with the exception being well (A-14-10)32DBD in the historical scenario. 
Model simulations with the climate change scenarios produce a slight increase in water 

 
68 
 
levels over baseline projections but not enough to overcome declining water levels 
attributed to groundwater overdrafting. The other four wells that were analyzed – three in 
the Verde Formation of the alluvial basin-fill aquifer of the Verde Valley and one in the 
Coconino aquifer below the basin-fill – showed similar declining trends. This means 
current pumping trends, which were held constant for this modeling exercise and are 
likely to increase in the future because of increased population, may not be sustainable. 
The difference in head between all five scenarios was within the range of mean absolute 
simulation error for wells in the Verde Valley (Pool et al 2011), which was 
approximately +/- 20.2 feet for wells located in alluvial aquifers and +/- 72.5 feet for 
wells located in the Coconino aquifer, meaning that these results are not statistically 
significant. 
 
These results have important implications for water sustainability in the 
southwestern United States and northern Arizona. Model simulations of both land-use 
and climate change show that even with increases in recharge, groundwater overdrafting 
continues to reduce well water levels, stream baseflow, and groundwater storage. These 
effects are detrimental to wildlife and their ecosystems, as well as communities in the 
southwestern United States. Communities will need to develop sustainable water 
management strategies to combat these issues. These strategies may include, but are not 
limited to, rain- and storm water harvesting, water recycling, new and innovative water 
pricing, and water rationing.

CHAPTER 4 – DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
4.1 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 
 
This study had two objectives: 1) to determine, through a systematic review 
process, how restoration forest thinning and burning impacts the water budget of semi-
arid, forested regions, and 2) to simulate how restoration forest thinning and burning and 
climate change impacts groundwater recharge in Northern Arizona. The systematic 
review revealed that there are few studies that quantify the effects that removing trees 
have on groundwater recharge and even fewer that focus on the semi-arid, southwestern 
United States. Instead, the focus was on surface water in general and groundwater in 
more humid locations with relatively low-depth to the water table. This made it difficult 
to determine how 4FRI treatments in Northern Arizona would affect groundwater 
recharge to aquifers located at considerable depths (>1000 feet) and therefore required a 
number of important assumptions.  
 
Results from the systematic review show that a rough relationship exists between 
tree removal and water yield: when basal area in a conifer-dominated watershed is 
reduced 20-100% annual water yield may increase by as much as 40%. These results 
were similar to those reported by Baker (2003). Using these numbers, I assumed that 
groundwater recharge was affected in a similar way to surface water yield and used this 
relationship to establish zones of recharge change based on basal area reduction in 4FRI 
and shelf stock treatment areas. By applying recharge-change factors to these zones and 
incorporating precipitation projections with a similar recharge change factor, it was 
estimated that recharge increased by approximately 38,000 acre-feet to the entire study 

 
71 
 
area and, more specifically, by approximately 18,000 acre-feet to the Verde Valley sub-
basin. This is approximately 1,800 acre-feet per year of treatment for ten years. All three 
IPCC climate scenarios – A1b, A2, and B1 – estimate a recovery from 2000-2005 
conditions, where precipitation was approximately 70% of annual average for the period 
1971-2000. The one exception is the last stress period of the A2 scenario for the years 
2090-2099. These climate change forecasts estimate precipitation will still be 
substantially less than historic averages, but more than 2000-2005 precipitation, from 
approximately 69% to 78% of annual average in the next 100 years. 
 
Regardless of increases in recharge from 4FRI treatments and precipitation 
recovery, water levels, baseflow, and groundwater storage continued to decline under 
current pumping conditions. Blasch et al. (2006) estimated a change of -39,000 acre-feet 
per year in storage for the Verde Valley during 2005. This declining trend continues into 
the future for all scenarios, with minor variations. This is attributed to surface-water 
diversions and overdrafting of groundwater supplies, a practice that is likely not 
sustainable and may have – and has likely already had – detrimental impacts to the 
environment, future surface and groundwater supplies, and natural and human 
communities that depend on these supplies. Summing up these findings, it is estimated 
that 4FRI treatments and projected changes in precipitation may increase recharge to 
regional aquifers, but these effects are likely to be masked by decreases in water levels, 
stream baseflow, and storage associated with groundwater pumping and surface-water 
diversions.   
 

 
72 
 
4.2 LIMITATIONS 
 
The data and methods used for this project were considered adequate but there 
were a number of limitations associated with the research. For example, the methods used 
to simulate changes in recharge from 4FRI treatments and climate change were based on 
a set of assumptions, the most important of which assumed that groundwater recharge 
was affected by tree removal in a similar way that surface water is reported to be 
affected. This relationship describes that when basal area in a semi-arid, ponderosa pine 
forest was reduced by 30-100%, water yields were observed to increase 15-40%. 
Treatments that reduced basal area by less than 30% were expected to show no increase 
in groundwater recharge. This assumption was made because the results from the 
systematic review were inconclusive as to how treatments in semi-arid, conifer-
dominated forests would affect recharge. This assumption was derived from a conceptual 
understanding of the hydrologic system in northern Arizona and there is no 
comprehensive empirical data to support this relationship, only data to show that it is 
likely that additional water will be available for recharge following forest restoration 
treatments.  
 
Another limitation is the reliability of the original recharge values built into the 
Northern Arizona Regional Groundwater- Flow Model, estimates which were derived 
from the Basin Characterization Model (Flint and Flint, 2008). The Basin 
Characterization Model (BCM) is a spatially distributed water-balance model that was 
developed to analyze how factors such as climate, topography, soils, geology, and 
vegetation affect recharge and runoff variability in the arid and semi-arid southwestern 
United States. Eight study-site basins, classified on the basis of climate, runoff, and in-

 
73 
 
place recharge, were analyzed to determine recharge at site-specific locations. Because of 
the variation between locations, a regional framework was developed so results from the 
eight study basins could be extrapolated across 194 basins in the region. The modelers 
assumed that these eight basins were representative of the entire study area. The BCM 
used the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) to 
model precipitation for the region of interest (PRISM Climate Group, 2012). PRISM uses 
point measurements of variables like precipitation and temperature to produce estimates 
of monthly, yearly, and event-based climatic parameters. Also built into the model are 
digital elevation models and expert knowledge of characteristics of complex climate 
systems in the semi-arid southwest, including rain shadows, coastal effects, and 
temperature inversions. PRISM data sets were initially produced for the period of record 
1971-2000. Subsequently, a data set for the period of record 1940-2005 was made 
available. Both of these data sets were available as monthly or annual data, and as map 
graphics or gridded data. In the case of the BCM, average annual recharge was calculated 
from the first set of available data (1971-2000). The NARGFM used these estimates to 
calculate annual recharge and subsequently used BCM data sets produced from the 1940-
2005 PRISM data to calculate recharge variability by decade.  
 
As briefly described above, the NARGFM used a multi-tiered approach to 
estimate groundwater recharge. Rather than using only historic data available for the 
region to estimate recharge – methods used estimate parameters like hydraulic 
conductivity and specific yield – the NARGFM relied on complex data sets from the 
BCM that relied on complex data sets from the PRISM. Because of this approach, there is 
considerable potential for accumulating errors. The possibility of compounding 

 
74 
 
uncertainties and assumptions can lead to results which may be inaccurate. Another 
limitation is that because model results are often non-unique, data may be produced that 
appears accurate yet may come from an incorrect description of the natural system being 
modeled (Oreskes et al., 1994). Ideally, rigorous and comprehensive model calibration 
would minimize the potential for a false model to produce accurate results. An important 
point to remember is that models in general, and groundwater models specifically, can 
never be validated, only invalidated (Konikow and Bredehoeft, 1992). Therefore, the best 
way to determine the usefulness of a model is a comprehensive post-audit. A more 
detailed list of limitations associated with the NARGFM can be found in its published 
report (Pool et al 2011).  
 
Another limitation associated with this research was the method used to derive 
recharge-change factors for the precipitation projections. To find this recharge-change 
factor, two different climate data-sets were compared against each other. One set of data 
from the PRISM was described above. These data were produced for the period of record 
and provided the climate data that were used in the NARGFM to estimate recharge 
decadal variations in recharge. Against these data were compared the downscaled data 
from the WCRP’s CMIP3 multi-model projections, as retrieved through Reclamation’s 
research and development office. As described in Chapter 3, we used the multi-model 
mean from 16 models to set our climate change boundaries. We assumed that the 
individual datasets were compatible. Finally, to find the recharge-change factor we 
compared precipitation data from the PRISM with precipitation data from the downscaled 
CMIP projections. The percent difference between the two was converted to a factor of 
difference and then applied to the NARGFM as either an increase or decrease in recharge 

 
75 
 
to simulate an increase or decrease in regional precipitation. These are indirect methods 
for modeling recharge but there was no compatibility between software used to run the 
NARGFM and software used to manipulate the climate data sets.  
 
Additional limitations include the timing of recharge to the regional aquifers, and 
a need for a re-calibration, post-audit, and sensitivity analysis of the NARGFM. The 
NARGFM simulates recharge as instantaneous and does not account for the delay that 
occurs from when additional rainwater infiltrates into the soil and that portion of water 
that percolates downward to regional aquifers. This is a process that can take anywhere 
from days to centuries and in some cases, millennia. Because recharge is not 
instantaneous, there is a likelihood that the additional recharge derived from treatments 
and climate change would not be seen in the system for many years. However, there is 
good reason to believe recharge may occur relatively quickly following 4FRI thinning 
and burning because these treatment occur along the Mogollon Rim, the area of primary 
recharge to regional aquifers in northern Arizona (Parker, 2005).  A re-calibration of the 
NARGFM to the years 2006-2013, a comprehensive post-audit, and a rigorous, 
quantitative sensitivity analysis were considered outside the scope of this project. These 
are considered necessary to increase the overall confidence and usefulness of the model 
but would require additional resources that were not available for this research. However, 
some of these features have been incorporated into sub-sections of the model including 
work done by the USGS in response to Prescott-area concerns about details of the Big 
Chino portion of the model, refinements made by AMEC to their Flagstaff Model for the 
City of Flagstaff, and possible, further refinements to the Flagstaff Model regarding 
pumping at Red Gap Ranch 40 miles east of Flagstaff.  

 
76 
 
 
Because models are approximations of natural systems, with a number of 
assumptions built in, their primary value is heuristic. The results produced here are 
simulations of the groundwater-flow system in northern Arizona, projected land-use/land-
cover change associated with the Four Forest Restoration Initiative and non-4FRI 
treatments, and projected precipitations values based on IPCC climate change scenarios, 
and are not considered predictions of future well levels, baseflow discharge, and recharge 
values. Instead, they are considered useful for identifying changes in the groundwater 
budget, in trend and magnitude, following forest treatments and changes in climate. They 
should be used in conjunction with others data such as those recovered from paired-
watershed studies to help guide decision-making with respect to groundwater supply and 
demand issues, operations, and balancing the needs of both natural and human 
communities.  
  
4.3 IMPLICATIONS 
 
If groundwater outflow exceeds groundwater inflow, we expect a decrease in well 
water levels, baseflow to streams, and groundwater storage. Because both natural and 
human communities depend on these resources to survive, a reduction in these supplies 
will present a problem for both communities. A 2008 publication by the Arizona Water 
Institute, The Natural Conservancy, and Northern Arizona University detailed some of 
the likely ecological impacts that could result from reduced groundwater supplies (Haney 
et al., 2008). These impacts include decreased discharge at springs, change of streams 
from perennial to ephemeral conditions, increased depth to and fluctuations of the water 
table, and increased average annual depth to saturated soils. These impacts may reduce 

 
77 
 
native vegetative diversity and abundance, and increase the abundance of non-native 
“weedy” species such as tamarisk. These changes in vegetation may change the structure 
and resiliency of native fish, bird, mammal, herptofauna, and invertebrate populations 
along the Verde River, a number of which are listed as threatened or endangered (Haney 
et al., 2008). Concerns already exist about the effects that pumping groundwater from the 
Big Chino aquifer may have on the flow of the Upper Verde River, where Verde 
headwater springs discharge. These and other issues have important implications for 
water rights and use in the study area.  
 
Human populations are also likely to be impacted by these changes. Blasch et al. 
(2006) estimated approximately 46,400 acre-feet per year of water use and subirrigation 
in the Verde Valley sub-basin. These uses include surface-water diversions, pumping 
wells, and transpiration from agriculture. Under current water use and recharge 
conditions, water levels and stream baseflow are expected to decline. This trend, as 
described in Chapter 3, is similar for all scenarios, even the B1 scenario which predicts 
considerable recovery of precipitation values over 2000-2005 conditions or 
approximately 8% more recharge from baseline conditions. The consequences of these 
results are that there will be an imbalance between water supply and demand. This may 
result in a significant amount of unmet demands for water users across the region.   
 
4.4 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE STUDIES 
 
Collection of hydrologic data and elimination of data deficiencies are one of the 
most important avenues of future research. The NARGFM was built with these 
deficiencies and requires re-calibration with seven years of additional data (2006-2013). 

 
78 
 
Additional refinements to the BCM, PRISM, and CMIP datasets would be useful. 
However, these would require input from a number of agencies and is likely outside the 
scope of future researchers who are attempting to quantify how land cover/land use and 
climate change affect the regional water budgets. Therefore a number of smaller-scope 
recommendations include incorporating future paired watershed study results into 
modeling assumptions. As described in Chapter 1, in addition to the systematic review 
and groundwater modeling associated with this research, a paired watershed study is also 
in development. The purpose of the paired watershed study is to collect water, mass, and 
energy balance data from 12 watersheds to quantify the benefits from 4FRI restoration 
treatment scenarios. This will include groundwater recharge data. This recharge study 
will help fill in the gaps in knowledge that was found with the systematic review 
completed for this study. A quantitative sensitivity analysis is also considered useful for 
the NARGFM as it will help better identify which variables are critical to the reliability 
and usefulness of the model and should be scrutinized the most.  
 
Another recommendation includes the application of different methods to 
simulate changes in recharge. For this study a recharge-change factor was used as an 
indirect method but in the future it may be beneficial to try and couple a groundwater 
model, vegetation model, and climate model. An example of a model that couples 
multiple processes is Hydrogeosphere (Therrien et al., 2004). This method would allow a 
more direct application of effects between variables. This will significantly increase the 
resources and personnel needed to determine impacts of land use/land cover and climate 
change but could significantly decrease the assumptions, limitations, and errors 
associated with the method used for this study. This may provide more reliable results 

 
79 
 
that could then be used to make more informed adaptive-management decisions with 
regards to forest restoration thinning and burning and the maximization of surface water 
and groundwater yield. Because recharge is highly variable across Northern Arizona and 
similar semi-arid landscapes, it is not recommended that broad zones of recharge, similar 
to those used to simulate hydraulic conductivity and storativity, be used.  
 
4.5 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WATER MANAGEMENT IN THE 
SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES 
 
A suggestion to the Forest Service for maximizing both surface-water runoff and 
groundwater recharge can be summed up in the findings published by Reclamation’s 
Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study (Reclamation, 2012). The 
purpose of this study was to define current and future imbalances in water supply and 
demand in the Colorado River Basin and adjacent areas that will receive Colorado River 
water for the next 50 years. This area includes northern Arizona, and the Grand Canyon 
through which the Colorado River runs, as well as the Verde River, Salt River, and Gila 
River basins that feed into the Colorado River system. A median water supply and 
demand projection estimates an imbalance between supply and demand of 3.2 million 
acre-feet per year by the year 2060 for the entire Colorado River Basin. A more detailed 
report aimed at the Verde River was commissioned by The Nature Conservancy and 
published in 2011 (Limbrunner et al., 2011).  
 
Potential strategies to resolve water supply and demand imbalances may include 
options that 1) increase water supply, 2) decrease water demand, 3) modify operations, 
and 4) use governance and implementation strategies related to water management and 

 
80 
 
allocation (Reclamation, 2012). Options to increase water supply include desalination, 
reuse, development of local supplies, watershed management, and importation; options to 
decrease water demand include municipal, industrial, and agricultural water conservation, 
and water use efficiency; options to modify operations include evaporation control and 
water transfers, exchanges, and banking. These solutions are not considered exhaustive 
but met the criteria that were used to evaluate all options and are therefore considered 
representative. These criteria included technical, environmental, and social concerns like 
technical feasibility, energy needs, and recreation, respectively. Other concerns include 
costs, timing, and water quality.  
 
When all options are considered, potential yield to the Colorado River Basin was 
estimated to be 5.7 million acre-feet per year by 2035 and 11 million acre-feet per year 
by 2060. When accounting for options that are not technologically feasible or have low 
estimates of reliability, this yield is reduced to 3.7 million acre-feet per year by 2035 and 
7 million acre-feet per year by 2060. The latter figure is more than double the estimated 
imbalance of 3.2 million acre-feet per year.  However, these figures are considered highly 
optimistic and are likely to be met with serious technical, economic, environmental, and 
social challenges. Nevertheless, the water supply and demand issues facing communities 
in the southwestern United States, like the estimations made here, are problems that will 
not solve themselves. Therefore strategies like these and others are needed to meet the 
required demands of both natural and human communities now and in the future.
