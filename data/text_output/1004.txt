ABSTRACT
Economic analysis was conducted on the feasibility of operating a small-sized (500kW/hour)
gasiﬁcation power plant producing heat and electricity in a rural town surrounded by forests in the
Republic of Korea. Cost factors that were considered over the plant’s 20-year life included wood
procurement, a wood grab loader, a chipper, a chip dryer, a gasiﬁer, a generator, land and building,
wages, and ofﬁce management. All the cost factors were calculated based on the 2016 market values
for logs, information from machine manufacturers, and a literature review. Revenues were estimated
from selling heat and electricity using the 2016 average prices that were sourced from Korea District
Heating Corporation and Korea Power Exchange, respectively. Using a spreadsheet program, cash
ﬂows for costs and revenues were arranged to calculate net present value, internal rate of return, and
payback period of the plant. Also, sensitivity analyses were performed on the cost of wood
procurement and revenues from selling heat and electricity, which were the most signiﬁcant factors
affecting the economic feasibility. The results, as reinforced by the sensitivity analysis, suggest an
investment in the small-sized gasiﬁcation power plant may be attractive from a ﬁnancial standpoint,
especially if the owners are in a position to get additional revenue from heat sales and to take
advantage of Renewable Energy Credits.

Introduction
The Republic of Korea (Korea) imports 96% of the energy it
consumes from other countries, and renewable energy such as
bioenergy and hydropower represented only 4.6% of the coun-
try’s total primary energy in 2015 (Korea Energy Agency
2016). In 2008 the government announced the “Third
National Energy Master Plan” to induce industrialization of
renewable energy in the country with a goal of supplying 11%
of the total energy demand from renewable resources by 2020
(Korea Presidential Committee on Green Growth 2009).
To support the plan, the government began enforcing
“Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS)” in 2012, by which a
utility company supplying over 500 MW per hour of electric-
ity must produce at least 2% of its total electricity supply using
renewable energy sources. Also, renewable energy certiﬁcates
(REC), which can be traded in the market, were introduced to
support the RPS policy (Korea Energy Agency 2012). The
number of REC traders increased from 5957 in 2014 to 12,458
in 2015, and to 16,890 in 2016 (Korea Power Exchange 2017).
Meanwhile, forest biomass is recognized as one of Korea’s
major renewable energy resources, being available in almost
all rural regions of the country. The forest area is 6370 thou-
sand hectares, which represents 63.6% of the country’s total
land area. The potential amount of forest biomass that could
be supplied through commercial or non-commercial harvest
was estimated to reach about 1.3 million tons per year (Korea
Forest Research Institute 2014).
With the rich forest biomass resources, efforts have been
focused on development of diverse forest biomass conversion
technologies (Ince et al. 2011), one of which is a small-sized
combined heat and power generator using a gasiﬁcation pro-
cess that was developed in Korea (Choi et al. 2005; Lee 2009;
Seo 2013). This effort was hoped to be especially promising
for rural areas surrounded by forests in which electricity for
heating and cooking is produced from non-renewable resour-
ces such as coal and gas, and is supplied from other areas. If
electric power and heat energy were produced using the
locally-supplied forest biomass, then heating and cooking
costs would potentially be less than if the energy is sourced
from other areas.
Economic analysis is a good tool for a potential owner of a
small gasiﬁcation power plant to evaluate the plant’s potential
economic performance and to identify variables critical to its
success. Therefore, the objectives of the study were: (i) to ana-
lyze the economic feasibility of installing and operating a small-
sized combined heat and power generator (500 kW/hour) using
forest biomass; (ii) to provide basic data that can be used to
assess the potential of biomass energy supply for mountain vil-
lages in Korea; and (iii) to create a ﬂexible and powerful spread-
sheet-based model that analysts could use to insert their own
assumptions to do a preliminary ﬁnancial feasibility analysis of
a small-scale combined heat and power generator.

Korea. An installation of this power plant in a rural town was
hypothesized and its major cost factors: wood procurement;
storing and chipping; chip drying; gasiﬁcation; and electricity
generation were incorporated into an economic analysis.
Costs incurred at each stage of the process were estimated
and applied to the analysis. Added in the cost analysis were
expenses for ancillary facilities, ﬁnance, and operation as
showed in Figure 1. Selling prices of electric power and heat
produced from the process were used as revenue. All costs
and selling revenues were sourced from 2016 market prices,
information from machine manufacturers, and a literature
review.
Each piece of equipment needing replacement over the 20-
year planning period was replaced at the end of its operating
life at its original cost plus inﬂation. At the end of the plan-
ning period, equipment book values based on straight-line
depreciation were used for terminal valuations.
Net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR),
and payback period (PP) were calculated based over a 20-
year cycle, which was the generator’s estimated life. Sensitiv-
ity analyses were also conducted for the cost of forest biomass
procurement and selling prices of electric power and heat.
Our generic models were prepared in a Microsoft®Ofﬁce
(Redmond, WA) Excel workbook ﬁle.
Investment cost analysis
The cost analysis includes two major parts: cost incurred
from the energy production process; and supporting cost
items and revenues from selling heat and electricity. We
hypothesized installation of this power plant in a rural town
that could be supplied with forest biomass from nearby
mountains. We assumed that all the power and heat pro-
duced from the plant would be sold to the residents in the
rural town. Table 1 summarizes investment costs at every
stage of the process and details are as follows.
Forest biomass procurement
Forest biomass procurement cost was determined based on a
ﬁnal consumer price for logs in 2016 (Korea Forestry Promo-
tion Institute 2016) and assumed to include costs for felling,
processing, yard, and transportation of logs.
Storage and chipping
Logs are moved to a wood depot and chipped after purchas-
ing them. Wood grab loader and chipping machine costs
were included for moving and chipping the materials. Their
operating costs were classiﬁed into fuel costs, and mainte-
nance and repair expenses. The latter were assumed to be
50% of their depreciation costs (Brinker et al. 1989). These
operating costs were assumed to increase by 5% per year.
These machines were assumed to have 10-year operating
lives.
Wood chip drying
Maintenance and repair expense of a dryer was assumed to
be 1% of the purchase and increase by 5% per year, but its
fuel cost was assumed to be zero as 40% of its heat produc-
tion is self-consumed for drying. The dryer was assumed to
have a 10-year operating life.
Gasiﬁer
Annual maintenance and repair expense of a gasiﬁer was
assumed to be 1% of the purchase and increase by 5% per
year, but its fuel cost to be zero as 10% of electric power pro-
duction is self-consumed for operating over its 20-year life.
Generator
Annual maintenance and repair expense of a generator was
assumed to be 4% of the purchase and increase by 5% per
year, but its fuel cost to be zero as gas produced from a gener-
ator is used for its operating. The generator was assumed to
have a 7-year operating life.

Land and construction
Land area for the plant was 2500 m2 in the study and con-
struction cost was for the whole facility of the plant and
included costs for ofﬁce, access road, fence, and pavement
work. Annual maintenance and repair expense was assumed
to be 1% of the construction cost and increase by 5% per year.
Land is not depreciable under South Korean tax law. The ter-
minal value of the land was its original cost plus inﬂation. The
buildings were depreciated over 20 years using straight line
depreciation. It was assumed that the plant and ofﬁce would
have no residual value at the end of the 20-year project life.
Labor and ofﬁce management
Labor cost (i.e., wages and beneﬁts) was based on eight full-
time workers (8 hours per day), including one for moving
and chipping logs, one for management and administration,
and six for power plant operation with a three shift system.
Also, insurance expense was applied at 0.4% of the facility
cost. Other miscellaneous expenses included water and elec-
tric power charges etc.
Financing
Financing includes both debt and equity. To reduce the early-
stage negative cash ﬂow do to the initial investment, it was
assumed there was a bank loan of ₩1,500,000 thousand
(Korean won) at a nominal (i.e., including inﬂation) ﬁxed
interest rate of 6% and a 10-year redemption period. The
model allows this interest rate to be set directly or as a func-
tion of the inﬂation rate, if desired. The bank’s loan initiation

fee was paid only at the start of the loan, which represented
47% of total initial investment.
Loans are commonly repaid in Korea using constant prin-
cipal repayments, which means that the interest payments
and total loan payments vary each year. This was the method
incorporated into the model. However, to allow ﬂexibility in
ﬁnancing and repayment options, the spreadsheet model is
constructed so that the loan may also be repaid using con-
stant loan repayments, which means that the interest pay-
ments and loan principal repayments vary with each loan
payment, but that each total annual loan payment is identical.
In both cases, while interest expenses are deducted from reve-
nue for tax purposes, principal repayments are not deducted.
The before ﬁnance and tax weighted average cost of capi-
tal is the minimum acceptable return rate on equity invest-
ment in the plant, which was set at 10.0%. This is a pre-tax
nominal rate; that is, it includes inﬂation. It is the before
ﬁnance and tax discount rate that was used in the discounted
cash ﬂow analysis. The before tax weighted average cost of
capital (8.0%) was calculated by weighting the equity dis-
count rate (10.0%) by the portion of equity in the initial
ﬁnancing and the bank’s loan interest rate (6.0%) by the por-
tion of debt in the initial ﬁnancing. The after tax weighted
average cost of capital (7.3%) was calculated by adding the
cost of equity to the after tax cost of debt with both costs
weighted according to the initial equity-debt mix.
Tax
National and local income taxes were incorporated at the
rates of 10% and 1% respectively when income was ₩0 to
₩0.2 billion, and 20% and 2% when income was between
₩0.2 billion and ₩2 billion.
Revenue analysis
The primary market for heat and electricity produced from
the power plant was assumed to be the rural town in which it
was built. Table 2 shows annual revenues from heat and
power production and details are as follows.
Revenues from selling electricity power
Before calculating electricity sales revenue per year, a calcula-
tion was needed for the unit selling price of power, which
comprises the system marginal price (SMP) of electricity and
the market price of a REC. The (SMP) is an ofﬁcial power
price of the Korea Power Exchange. To promote the use of
renewable energy, the government enacted RPS)in 2014,
under which a plant producing power from renewable sour-
ces such as biomass and water can issue the REC that can be
traded in the market. When a forest biomass REC is sold to
Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), the REC is pro-
vided with a 1.5 weight factor (i.e. £ 1.5) above the SMP to
determine its market price (Korea Ministry of Trade,
Industry and Energy 2014). This REC weighting factor helps
to make the production of biomass-generated energy ﬁnan-
cially feasible.
Revenues from selling heat
The combined heat and power generator of this study pro-
duced 1436 Mcal of heat energy as well as 500kW of electric-
ity per hour. Unlike electricity, selling heat requires facilities
to be built for sending heat to households, which usually
involves high costs. The unit selling price of heat for house-
hold was collected from Korea District Heating Corporation
and used in the cost analysis, although to realize these heat
sales revenues, additional distribution infrastructural invest-
ment may be required.
Other assumptions used for the economic analysis
The other assumptions are as follows:
– Inﬂation was 3% and ﬁxed over a 20-year project period.
– A working capital fund required for running the plant
was set at 2% of total annual revenue and recovered at
the end of year 20.
– Capital costs including wood grab loader, chipper,
dryer, gasiﬁer, generator, construction, and land begin
at year 0 and other costs including forest biomass, labor
and ofﬁce management, interest, and reserved fund
begin at year 1.
– Straight-line depreciation is used for all depreciable
assets.
– No capital gains taxes were assumed. Also, no tax
allowances were made for capital loss carry backs or
carry forwards.
– No capital equipment would be replaced in year 20.
– Total costs and revenue occurred at the end of each
year over a 20-year period.
– Assets with residual values at the end of year 20 are val-
ued at book for ﬁnancial feasibility calculations.
Development of a cash ﬂow model
The cash-ﬂow model includes a number of parameters that
are related to basic economic assumptions and investment
ﬁnancing options. The basic economic assumptions include
the economic life of the project, and inﬂation rates for costs
and revenue over the project period. It should be noted that
inﬂation does not change the bank interest rate charged on
the loan, unless that rate has been set as a function of inﬂation.
Similarly, the inﬂation rate does not change the depreciation
expenses as they become ﬁxed when assets are purchased.
To illustrate the model, the cash ﬂow calculations
extended out for 20 years (Figure 2). The cash ﬂow model is
divided into four major sections, which allow an analyst to
focus on speciﬁc cash ﬂows to determine the impacts of
changes in various variables or options:
I. Capital cash ﬂows: include land, buildings, and
equipment that are replaced as necessary. Capital
cash ﬂows also include investments in working capi-
tal. Note in this section that equipment is replaced at
the end of its economic life and that estimated sal-
vage values are increased by the inﬂation rate. If

alterations will be reﬂected in an automatically-
updated cash ﬂow table.
II. Operating cash ﬂows: are the day-to-day revenues
and expenses that must be recovered in order for the
business to operate over the short term.
III. Financing cash ﬂows: consist of cash ﬂows related to
any debt that is taken on to help pay for the capital
assets. They are divided into the initial loan, which
is
a
positive
cash
ﬂow,
tax-deductible
interest
expenses, and loan principal repayments.
IV. Taxes: based on taxable income.
In the cash ﬂow table, three rows are highlighted in yellow
that represent the most important net cash ﬂows:
 before ﬁnance and tax;
 before tax; and
 after tax.
To aid in feasibility analysis, pro forma income statements are
also calculated and are shown (Figure 3). In the pro forma
income statements, only revenues and expenses are shown. Earn-
ings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
(EBITDA) is shown, along with earnings before interest and
taxes (EBIT), earnings before taxes, and ﬁnally net income (loss).
All ﬁnancial measures are computed three ways: before
ﬁnance and tax; before tax; and after tax. NPVs and the pay-
back period are both computed using the three highlighted
nominal cash ﬂows and the three costs of capital (10.0%,
8.0%, and 7.3%, respectively). The payback period is the year
in which the accumulated cash ﬂow, including a capital charge
based on the respective cost of capital, turns positive. If the
accumulated cash ﬂow does not turn positive over the 20-year
planning period, then an “Infeasible” message is returned,
indicating that the capital and the minimum required return
on capital are never completely paid back. IRRs are computed
both on the basis of nominal cash ﬂows that include inﬂation,
and on a real won basis, which are over and above inﬂation.
Sensitivity analysis
Of greater concern was the sensitivity of the ﬁnancial feasibil-
ity of running the plant to changes in important factors deter-
mining costs and revenues. Several types of sensitivity analyses
were built into the model through the adjustment of sensitivity
factors to make it easy for users to get a sense of the impor-
tance of various cost and revenue assumptions. These are per-
centages that are multiplied by the costs or revenues so that
an analyst can see the impact of percentage changes in these
variables on the overall ﬁnancial return measures. This
method was used to test for changes in forest biomass prices
and revenue from sales of heat. This method was also used to
examine the sensitivity of ﬁnancial returns to changes in REC
prices, which easily ﬂuctuate according to supply and demand
and constitute a major portion of the electricity selling price.
Result and discussion
Financial feasibility of running a small-sized combined
heat and power plant

The project’s IRR was 12.3% after accounting for inﬂation
and income taxes, given the assumptions used.
Revenue that would be earned from selling electricity and
heat over the 20-year planning period discounted at the 7.3%
after tax cost of capital totaled ₩18,441 million. On an annu-
alized basis it came to ₩1779 million. After-tax proﬁts in
addition to the after-tax cost of capital represented about
8.3% of the total discounted revenue. Forest biomass pro-
curement was the largest single cost and represented 34.0%
of the total revenue, followed by other operating costs
(32.9%), and net capital costs (20.4%) (Figure 4).
It is noteworthy that, in this example, the loan ﬁnancing
was not a net cost, but rather resulted in a small net beneﬁt
(₩74 million). This was because the bank interest rate (6.0%)
was less than the before ﬁnance and tax equity cost of capital
(10.0%) and the project was earning a rate of return that was
greater than the loan rate. The result was positive ﬁnancial
gearing that increased the equity rates of return, which were
shown by the before tax and after tax IRRs that were higher
than the before ﬁnance and tax IRRs.
Sensitivity analysis on key cost and revenue variables
The quickest way of measuring the importance of costs in a
business enterprise is to divide them by sales revenue. The
larger the percentage of costs in relation to total sales reve-
nues, the more sensitive net proﬁts (or losses) will be to
changes in those costs. Our analysis showed that forest bio-
mass procurement costs were the largest component of total
capital costs and that capital costs, while signiﬁcant at 20.4%,
are less important than operating costs in determining the
plant’s proﬁtability (Figure 4).
Sensitivity analysis by forest biomass price change
As the forest biomass price per unit increased from 60% to
150% of its base value, NPV before ﬁnance and tax
discounted at 10.0% decreased from ₩3.3 billion to –₩1.3
billion and real IRR from 20.0% to 0.3%. Payback period
increased from 4 years at 60% to 20 years at 120% but it was
infeasible after 130% (Figure 5). If the forest biomass price
per unit increases to over 130%, it means that renewably-gen-
erated electricity would not receive any marketplace pre-
mium over any other electricity. In this case, NPVs or IRRs
turn negative and the payback period becomes infeasible –
that is, the project’s capital costs are never paid back.
NPV before tax discounted at 8.0% decreased from ₩4.4
billion to –₩0.9 billion and real IRR from 30.4% to –0.5%,
while payback period increased from 2 years at 60% to
20 years at 130% and was infeasible after 140%. NPV after
tax discounted at 7.3% decreased from ₩3.5 billion to –₩0.9
billion and real IRR from 23.0% to –0.7%, while the payback
period increased from 6 years at 60% to 20 years at 130% and
was infeasible after 140%.
Sensitivity analysis by change of REC price
As the revenue from power selling per unit changed from
60% to 150% of its base value, NPV before ﬁnance and tax
discounted at 10.0% increased from –₩1.6 billion to ₩4.9
billion and real IRR from –2.0% to 25.7%, while payback
period decreased from 17 years at 90% to 5 years at 150%
and was infeasible before 80% (Figure 6). NPV before tax dis-
counted at 8.0% increased from –₩1.4 billion to ₩6.3 billion
and real IRR from –3.3% to 41.0%, while payback period
decreased from 20 years at 80% to 3 years at 150% and was
infeasible before 70%. NPV after tax discounted at 7.3%
increased from –₩1.4 billion to ₩5.1 billion and real IRR
from –3.3% to 31.3%, while payback period decreased from
20 years at 80% to 3 years at 150% and was infeasible before
70%.
Sensitivity analysis by revenue change from selling heat
Unlike power, selling heat is relatively limited and uncertain
because it requires additional and expensive distribution
infrastructure (i.e., pipes) to send heat to consumers. How-
ever, heat sales are critical to the facility’s overall economics.
The revenue from selling heat was assumed to change from
60% to 150% of its base value for the analysis. The result was
that NPV before ﬁnance and tax discounted at 10.0%
increased from –₩0.6 billion to ₩3.5 billion and real IRR

from –2.0% to 25.7%, while the payback period decreased
from 20 years at 80% to 6 years at 150% (Table 4). NPV
before tax discounted at 8.0% increased from –₩0.1 billion
to ₩3.7 billion and real IRR from 4.1% to 32.1%, while the
payback period decreased from 20 years at 70% to 4 years at
150%. NPV after tax discounted at 7.3% increased from
–₩0.2 billion to ₩3.8 billion and real IRR from 3.4% to
24.3%, while the payback period decreased from 19 years at
70% to 4 years at 150%. Note that at revenue recovery rates
on heat of 60% or less of our base case, the payback period
becomes infeasible; that is, the capital investment is never
recovered (Table 4).

Conclusion
Economic analysis was conducted for a small-sized (500kW/
hour) combined heat and power plant with a 20-year life that
would provide a rural town surrounded by forested moun-
tains with heat and power using forest biomass. Cost factors
that were considered in the analysis included wood procure-
ment, a wood grab loader, a chipper, a chip dryer, a gasiﬁer, a
generator, land and building, wages, and ofﬁce management.
All the cost factors were calculated based on the 2016 market
values for logs, machine manufacturers’ prices, and a litera-
ture review. Revenues were estimated from selling heat and
electricity using the 2016 average prices that were sourced
from Korea District Heating Corporation and Korea Power
Exchange, respectively. Using a spreadsheet program, cash
ﬂows for costs and revenues were arranged to calculate net
present value, internal rate of return and payback period of
the plant. Calculations were done three ways: before ﬁnance
and tax; before tax; and after tax. Also, sensitivity analyses
were performed on the cost of wood procurement, and reve-
nues from selling heat and electricity, which were the most
signiﬁcant factors affecting the economic feasibility.
The results showed that the project was not so promising
and internal rate of return was about 12.3% after tax. As a
percentage of the total revenue over the 20-years project,
wood purchasing cost was the largest item representing
34.3% of the revenue, followed by other operating costs
(33.1%), net capital costs (20.5%), and net proﬁt (8.3%).
Sensitivity analysis by forest biomass price showed that
NPV after tax discounted at 7.3% decreased from ₩3.5 bil-
lion to –₩0.9 billion and real IRR from 23.0% to –0.7% as
the forest biomass price per unit was changed from 60% to
150% of its base value. While the payback period increased
from 6 years at 60% to 20 years at 130% and was infeasible
after 140%. As the REC price increased from 60% to 150% of
its base value, NPV after tax discounted at 7.3% increased
from –₩1.4 billion to ₩5.1 billion and real IRR from –3.3%
to 31.3%, while payback period decreased from 20 years at
80% to 3 years at 150% but was infeasible before 70%. When
the revenue from heat selling was assumed to increase from
60% to 150% of its base value, NPV after tax discounted at
7.3% increased from –₩0.2 billion to ₩3.8 billion and real
IRR from 3.4% to 24.3%, while payback period decreased
from 19 years at 70% to 4 years at 150%.
For such an investment to succeed, a sustained and afford-
able supply of forest biomass from around mountain villages
is the most important prerequisite for operating the plant,
and development of an optimized timber harvest system is
needed through evaluation of the usable forest resource and
annual timber harvest planning (Han et al. 2011). Also note
that the plant’s economic viability depends on the amount of
heat sales. Ideally a plant would be located where the piping
already exists to distribute a plant’s excess heat, because costs
can be high to install such infrastructure. Finally, a biomass
gasiﬁcation plant’s ﬁnancial feasibility will depend on premi-
ums paid for renewably-generated electricity, especially if
extra margin weightings exist for biomass-generated electric-
ity, because without the continuance of these premiums, a
small-sized combined heat and power biomass gasiﬁcation
plant in the Republic of Korea would likely not be economic.
