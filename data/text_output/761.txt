Foresters take Payson Residents and Visitors on a Walk in the Woods 
 
FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. – Ecologists and foresters from the Ecological Restoration Institute at 
Northern Arizona University and the Tonto National Forest are inviting Payson area 
residents and visitors to join them on a FREE Walk in the Woods from 9 a.m. to noon, 
Wednesday, June 30. The group will meet at the Payson Ranger Station, 1009 E. 
Highway 260, about half a mile east of Safeway for a brief introduction. Transportation 
will be provided for two short stops in the nearby forest. 
 
In the setting of the ponderosa pine/oak forest, researchers will discuss and show the 
difference between today’s unnatural forest structure and forest conditions before 
European settlement of the West in the late 1800s. 
 
“Intense livestock grazing, federal fire suppression policies and harvesting of the older 
ponderosas contributed to today’s unhealthy forest ecosystems,” said ERI Executive 
Director Wally Covington. “Without frequent, low-severity fires that killed tree 
seedlings, the once park-like forests have become overcrowded with dense stands of 
small trees. They not only choke out grasses and wildflowers but also set the stage for 
unprecedented crown fires.” 
 
Foresters will discuss how these same policies and practices played a part in the development of 
dense, unhealthy forests in the Payson area and also will showcase forest treatments in the 
urban interface, where the homes meet the forest. ERI ecologists will reveal research 
findings and discuss what it will take to restore health to millions of acres of frequent-
fire forest ecosystems across the American West.

Bonnie Stevens at 928-380-4349.
