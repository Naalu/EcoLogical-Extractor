Effectiveness

Abstract
We evaluated landscape-scale forest restoration treatment
implementation and effectiveness in meeting objectives in
a ponderosa pine forest at Mt. Trumbull, Arizona, U.S.A.
The goal of the project was to alter forest structure by
thinning and burning to more closely resemble forest con-
ditions prior to Euro-American settlement in 1870. We
measured 117 permanent plots before (1996/1997) and
after (2003) treatments. The plots were evenly distributed
across the landscape (approximately 1,200 ha), about half
of which was an untreated control. We evaluated treat-
ment implementation and effectiveness based on 1870
structure and/or goals outlined by managers. The success
of treatment implementation varied: about 94% of the
area originally planned for restoration was treated in some
manner by 2003, but only 70% received the full planned
treatment (thin and burn). Although density of ponderosa
pines >2.5 cm was reduced signiﬁcantly by 66% from
approximately 429 pines/ha to approximately 146 pines/ha
in the treated area, the targeted residual density was ex-
ceeded by 111–256% (all plots) or 10–85% (thinned and
burned plots). Thirteen percent of the pre-settlement
pines died in the treated area by 2003, but 9% percent also
died in the control, indicating that pre-settlement pines
in untreated areas were nearly as vulnerable as those
exposed to restoration treatments. Large snags increased
45%, and 65% of logs >50 cm were retained, achieving im-
plementation goals. Although restoration treatments were
not implemented totally to speciﬁcations, they were effec-
tive in attaining the overall project goal of restoring more
open forest structure while preserving more than 75% of
the pre-settlement pines. Canopy fuel loads were substan-
tially reduced, allowing for the reintroduction of surface
ﬁres.

Introduction
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) ecosystems throughout
the southwestern United States have become uncharacter-
istically dense as a result of livestock grazing, logging, ﬁre
exclusion, and climatic factors such as pulsed precipitation
(Cooper 1960; Covington & Moore 1994a, 1994b; Savage
et al. 1996; Covington et al. 1997). Changes in ﬁre regime
and forest structure have increased the vulnerability of
ponderosa pine forests to large, stand-replacing crown
ﬁres (Allen et al. 2002). Ecological restoration provides
an opportunity to restore the natural structure and func-
tion of these ﬁre-adapted ecosystems consistent with their
evolutionary environment (Moore et al. 1999) and has
been applied throughout the western United States
(Youngblood et al. 2006; Fajardo et al. 2007). Similar con-
cerns about severe wildﬁres in uncharacteristically dense
forests have been the focus of restoration efforts in pine–
oak ecosystems of Europe (Pausas et al. 2004) and Mexico
(Rodrı´guez-Trejo & Fule´ 2003).
Initiated in 1995, the Mt. Trumbull Ponderosa Pine
Ecosystem Restoration Project is the longest running
landscape-scale ponderosa pine restoration project in the
Southwest (Friederici 2003) and the ﬁrst to incorporate
intensive monitoring. This is a landscape-scale study
because it examines a 12-km2 area with multiple stands
interspersed with several ecosystem types. The primary
goal of the project was to restore forest structure and pro-
cesses within the historical range of variability, as well as
reduce fuel loads, disrupt fuel continuity, and reduce the
likelihood of stand-replacing crown ﬁres by implementing
mechanical thinning followed by prescribed surface ﬁre
(Moore et al. 1999, 2003). This article focuses on the mon-
itoring and adaptive management (AM) elements of the
restoration project.
AM requires adjusting management actions on the basis
of monitoring information (Holling 1978; Walters 1986).
This ‘‘learn-by-doing’’ approach has been used in natural
resource management since the 1970s. AM is classiﬁed into
two types: ‘‘passive’’ and ‘‘active’’ (Walters & Holling 1990).
In passive AM, the perceived ‘‘best’’ management action
is implemented, and adjustments are made according to

monitoring information and evaluation. In active AM,
a range of alternatives are designed and implemented and
then monitoring and evaluation are used to identify which
alternative was most effective, and ﬁnally, adjustments to
subsequent management decisions are made (Murray &
Marmorek 2003).
Monitoring, or repeated measurement of ecological var-
iables through time, is crucial for evaluating management
actions (Fule´ 2003). Implementation and effectiveness
monitoring are particularly important when AM princi-
ples are used (Block et al. 2001; Moir & Block 2001).
Implementation monitoring reveals to managers whether
the treatments were implemented as originally prescribed.
It would be difﬁcult to justify changing treatment prescrip-
tions if managers were unsure whether the original pre-
scriptions were followed. Effectiveness monitoring, ‘‘the
process of determining if an activity achieved the stated
goal or objectives’’ (Noss & Cooperrider 1994), allows
managers to determine if objectives were met. The imple-
mentation of treatments and the ultimate effectiveness of
treatments in a project may not necessarily have the same
success. For example, the goals of a project could be met
even if the treatments were not implemented as planned.
Alternatively, the treatment could be carried out pre-
cisely, but the desired goals may not be met at all.
Our objective in this study was to evaluate the forest
structure effects of restoration across the Mt. Trumbull
landscape. Speciﬁcally, we intend to answer two overarch-
ing questions: (1) Were restoration treatments imple-
mented as planned? and (2) Were the treatments effective
in terms of the ecological restoration goals?
Methods
Study Area
Mt. Trumbull is located in northwestern Arizona, U.S.A.,
in the Uinkaret Mountains on the Arizona Strip in the
Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument and man-
aged by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Vegeta-
tion in the study area (elevation 2,000–2,250 m) comprised
ponderosa pine and Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) with
Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma), Pinyon pine (Pinus
edulis), and New Mexico locust (Robinia neomexicana).
Soils are derived from basaltic parent material. Between
1992 and 2003, annual precipitation at Nixon Flats (eleva-
tion 1,981 m, about 3 km northeast of the study site) aver-
aged 39.4 cm with an average January temperature of 1C
and an average July temperature of 21C (Western
Regional Climate Center 2005). At Mt. Logan (elevation
2,195 m, about 2 km southwest of the study site), annual
precipitation averaged 31.2 cm with an average January
temperature of 0C and an average July temperature of
20C between 1992 and 2003 (Western Regional Climate
Center 2005). Extended drought occurred between 1994
and 2003 in northwestern Arizona (NOAA 2006). Most
precipitation occurs in winter and during summer monsoon
storms. Large-tree logging occurred between 1870 and 1947
within the study site (R. Davis 2003, BLM, St. George, UT,
personal communication).
About 500 ha of the approximately 1,200 ha study land-
scape comprise a contiguous, ‘‘untreated,’’ densely treed
area (hereafter ‘‘control’’); the remaining 700 ha, hereafter
‘‘treated area,’’ are adjacent to the control. Restoration
treatment units were delineated, and treatments were
carried out between 1996 and 2003 (Moore et al. 2003;
Waltz et al. 2003). The location of the control was chosen
because it was adjacent and had similar forest structure to
the treated area, but it was selected as a control because
much of it was not in BLM ownership and thus not avail-
able for treatment. Some untreated areas remain within
the treated area boundary, such as controls for other
experiments or operationally inaccessible areas, in patches
ranging from about 10 to 40 ha. Additionally, some areas
within the treated area were thinned only or burned only
(Fig. 1).
Restoration Treatment Prescriptions
The thinning design was made according to the pre-
settlement (pre-1870) pattern of tree species composition
and spatial arrangement (Covington et al. 1997; Waltz
et al. 2003). The year 1870 was chosen because it repre-
sented the end of the historical frequent ﬁre regime and
was the date of Euro-American settlement (Waltz et al.
2003). All living ponderosa pines older than 1870 or larger
than 70-cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were retained
(Moore et al. 2003). Pre-settlement ponderosa pines of
any size were identiﬁed in the ﬁeld based on yellow bark
coloration and other tree characteristics (White 1985). In
addition, wherever evidence of pre-settlement ponderosa
pine material was encountered (i.e., snags, logs, stumps,
stump holes), 1.5 post-settlement ponderosa pine replace-
ment trees (if >40.6 cm dbh) or three ponderosa pine
replacement trees (if 40.6 cm dbh) were retained within
an approximately 18.2 m search radius. The net result was
to retain all the pre-settlement ponderosa pines that were
still alive plus leave up to 300% more ponderosa pine
trees than were present prior to 1870. The surplus of
retained trees was intended to account for the reduced
biomass contributed by smaller diameter replacement
trees, possible loss of pre-settlement evidence, and to
allow a margin for unintended mortality due to restoration
treatments (Covington et al. 1997). Therefore, rather than
a ‘‘one-size-ﬁts-all’’ approach, areas that were relatively
open in 1870 (i.e., few remnants found) would be rela-
tively open after treatment, and areas that were relatively
dense in 1870 would be relatively dense after treatment.
Originally, Gambel oak trees were also thinned but given
high oak mortality due to prescribed burning, these guide-
lines were modiﬁed early in the project to terminate oak
cutting. Trees of other species were not cut because
they were sparse and relatively susceptible to prescribed
ﬁre.

noncommercially thinned in this leave-tree thinning. Slash
was lopped and scattered and was crushed by a bulldozer
in some areas (Jerman et al. 2004). Accumulated forest
ﬂoor material was raked away from living pre-settlement
trees to prevent cambial girdling (Sackett et al. 1996) and
away from large snags to limit ignition (Moore et al. 2003)
during prescribed ﬁres.
Field Methods
Prior to treatment in 1996 and 1997, we installed 117 per-
manent plots on a 300-m grid throughout the Mt. Trumbull
landscape as part of a before-after-control-impact (BACI)
study design (Stewart-Oaten & Bence 2001). The BACI
design is appropriate for studying landscape-scale treat-
ment-control pairs, but because treatments are not inde-
pendently replicated, the design limits inferences to the
study area. All plots (55 control, 61 treated, and 1 partially
treated and excluded from analysis) were remeasured in
2003. The plots were modiﬁed from the National Park
Service’s Fire Monitoring plots (Reeberg 1995; NPS 2003).
Plots were 0.1 ha (20 3 50 m) in size, oriented with the
50-m sides uphill–downhill.
Overstory trees (15 cm dbh) were measured on the
entire plot (1,000 m2), and trees between 2.5–14.9 cm dbh
(pole-sized trees) were measured on one-quarter plot
(250 m2); all trees were tagged. Tree attributes measured
were species, dbh, and condition class (Thomas et al.
1979). Height was measured for pole-sized trees but not
for overstory trees during the pre-treatment measure-
ment; height and crown base height were measured for all
trees in 2003. Regeneration (<2.5 cm dbh) was tallied by
Figure 1. The intended treatment (i.e., thin 1 burn) was not fully implemented at Mt. Trumbull, which resulted in a structurally diverse landscape.
All six photos were taken in the treated area in 2003 and show the treatments that actually occurred: (A) untreated, (B) thinned only, (C) burned
only, and (D, E, F) thinned 1 burned.

species, condition, and height class in a 50-m2 subplot.
Ponderosa pine trees were considered potentially pre-
settlement if dbh 37.5 cm or if bark was yellowed (White
1985). Trees of other species were considered potentially
pre-settlement if dbh 17 cm dbh (Barger & Ffolliott
1972). Tree cores were collected at 40 cm above ground
level for all potentially pre-settlement trees and for a ran-
dom 10% subsample of all other live trees 2.5 cm to
determine past size, as described below. Canopy cover
measured by vertical projection (Ganey & Block 1994)
was recorded at 3-m intervals along the two 50-m side-
lines of each plot for a total of 32 points per plot. Post-
treatment measurements on plots coincided as closely as
possible to the original day and month of the original
measurement.
Reconstruction Methods
Tree increment cores were surfaced and crossdated
(Stokes & Smiley 1968) using locally developed tree-ring
chronologies. Rings were counted on cores that could not
be crossdated.
We reconstructed historical forest structure (tree den-
sity, diameter distribution, and basal area [BA] by species)
using dendroecological methods (Fule´ et al. 1997; Mast
et al. 1999). We reconstructed diameter for all living trees
by subtracting the radial growth since 1870 measured on
increment cores and estimated death date of dead trees on
the basis of tree condition class using diameter-dependent
snag decomposition rates (Thomas et al. 1979; Rogers
et al. 1984). Diameters were adjusted for bark thickness.
We performed a sensitivity analysis by using the 25th,
50th, and 75th percentile decomposition rates to examine
the effect of slower or faster decomposition on estimates
of death date and 1870 structure. Less than ±1% change
in reconstructed density or BA occurred during this analy-
sis, so the 50th percentile reconstruction was used in this
study.
Forest structure reconstruction methods were based on
the assumption that evidence of trees (i.e., snags, logs,
stumps, stump holes) present in 1870 was intact and cor-
rectly identiﬁed during the pre-treatment inventory. The
probability that this occurred was relatively high given the
absence of ﬁre since 1870 combined with the semiarid
environment limiting the decomposition of conifer wood
(Fule´ et al. 1997; Mast et al. 1999; Waltz et al. 2003) and
because ﬁeld crews were trained to identify the presence
and species of pre-settlement structures. Moore et al.
(2004) found that reconstruction ﬁeld techniques in a similar
environment and forest type were reliable within ±10% for
tree density over approximately 90 years.
Evaluation of Treatment Implementation and Effectiveness
We quantitatively compared the 2003 ponderosa pine
(hereafter ‘‘pine’’) density to the targeted pine density to
evaluate whether thinning prescriptions
were imple-
mented as planned. We calculated the targeted pine
density as the sum of all living pre-settlement trees plus
150–300% of the pre-settlement remnant evidence (1.5–
3.0 post-settlement trees retained per pre-settlement evi-
dence). Because a targeted tree density was not set for
species other than ponderosa pines, we simply reported
on cutting and mortality for these other species. We evalu-
ated treatment implementation effectiveness and whether
any pre-settlement trees had been cut, as well as changes
in snag and log densities by comparing 2003 outcomes to
existing goals outlined by managers. We used 1870 forest
structure as a point of reference to evaluate diameter dis-
tributions, BA, regeneration, and canopy cover.
Statistical Analysis
We tested whether the control and treated areas differed
in live tree density and BA, snag and log density, regener-
ation density, and canopy cover before (1996/1997) and
after treatment (2003). Univariate analyses examined total
response (e.g., total live tree density across all species)
and were made using Wilcoxon tests to obtain a Z-score
for each test in 1996/1997 and in 2003. Changes in tree
density and BA from 1870 compared to 1996/1997 across
the entire landscape were analyzed with Wilcoxon signed
ranks tests (T1) because the control and treated areas
were combined (Conover 1999). These areas were com-
bined because the control and treated areas were not
established prior to 1996/1997. The alpha for all analyses
was 0.05.
Results
Reconstructed tree density and BA indicated that rela-
tively open forest structure (average 97 trees/ha and
9.5 m2/ha BA) existed across the Mt. Trumbull landscape
in 1870. Ponderosa pine made up 95% of the total BA
but only 38% of total tree density (Table 1). The control
and treated areas did not differ in terms of total tree den-
sity (Z ¼ 20.9, p ¼ 0.367) in 1870, although the total BA
was slightly greater (Z ¼ 2.0, p ¼ 0.041) in the control
(Table 1). Total tree density (Z ¼ 0.5, p ¼ 0.584) and
total BA (Z ¼ 20.4, p ¼ 0.676) did not differ between
treated and control areas prior to treatment in 1996/
1997. Ponderosa pine dominated the 1996/1997 pre-
treatment landscape making up 73% of the total density
and 86% of the total BA in the control area and compris-
ing 55% of the total density and 79% of the total BA in
the treated area.
By 2003, treatments caused total tree density (Z ¼ 5.0,
p < 0.0001) and total BA (Z ¼ 5.1, p < 0.001) to decrease
signiﬁcantly in the treated area (Table 1). Although post-
treatment forest structure was relatively open in the trea-
ted area, there were a range of densities ranging from
extremely open 0.1 ha patches (minimum of 10 trees/ha)
to 0.1 ha patches that were relatively dense (maximum of
1,581 trees/ha). There were also relatively open areas in

the control (minimum of 108 trees/ha), but the most dense
areas (maximum of 3,337 trees/ha) were more than twice
as dense as the densest treated areas. The variability
throughout the landscape in all time periods was illus-
trated by interpolating BA across the plot grid (Fig. 2). In
2003, ponderosa pine comprised 72% of total BA/ha but
only made up 37% of the total trees/ha in the treated area.
Conversely, Gambel oak accounted for 26% of the BA/ha
but made up 56% of the total trees/ha. Juniper, pinyon,
and locust were relatively sparse throughout the landscape
in all time periods. Tree density and BA were even lower
in the 2003 treated area when plots that were thinned
only, burned only, or not treated were excluded from anal-
ysis. Sites that were thinned and burned had 73% fewer
trees and 55% less BA compared to pre-treatment levels
(Table 2).
Nearly two-thirds of the overall reduction in total tree
density and three-quarters in total BA from 1996/1997
to 2003 in the treated area was due to the thinning of pon-
derosa pine. The thinning of other species accounted for
only about 3% of the overall decrease in total tree density
and total BA. Mortality of unthinned ponderosa pine
accounted for 7% of the decrease in total tree density and
12% of the decrease in total BA, whereas mortality of the
other species accounted for 19% of the reduction in total
tree density but only 3% of the decrease in total BA in
the treated area.
Actual ponderosa pine tree density in the treated area
exceeded the targeted outcome by 111–256%. According
to the pre-treatment sample data, the targeted outcome
was to retain an average of approximately 41–69 pines/ha
comprised approximately 13 live pre-settlement pines/ha
and approximately 28 (150% of pre-settlement pine evi-
dence) to approximately 56 (300% of pre-settlement pine
evidence) post-settlement replacement pines/ha. The post-
treatment tree density averaged approximately 146 pines/ha
(Table 1) consisting of approximately 10 live pre-settlement
pines/ha and approximately 135 post-settlement pines/ha.
Pine density averaged approximately 76 pines/ha when only
thinned and burned plots were analyzed (Table2) exceeding
the targeted residual density by only 10–85%.
An objective of the restoration project was to avoid
cutting or killing pre-settlement trees (older than 1870);
very few such trees were cut (<5%) but 20% died, proba-
bly from ﬁre. A total of 3.0 pre-settlement trees/ha repre-
senting 0.18 m2/ha BA (Pinus ponderosa ¼ 0.8 trees/ha
and 0.1 m2/ha BA and Quercus gambelii ¼ 2.2 trees/ha
and 0.08 m2/ha BA) were cut during the restoration treat-
ment; none were cut in the control. A total of 13.5 pre-set-
tlement trees/ha representing 1.1 m2/ha BA (P. ponderosa

Q. gambelii ¼ 1.5 trees/ha and 0.06 m2/ha BA) died in the
control. However, 52.5 pre-settlement trees/ha represent-
ing 6.5 m2/ha BA (P. ponderosa ¼ 10.4 trees/ha and
4.8 m2/ha BA, Q. gambelii ¼ 41.1 trees/ha and 1.6 m2/ha
BA, and J. osteosperma ¼ 1.0 trees/ha and 0.07 m2/ha BA)
remained alive in the treated area and 45.6 pre-settlement
trees/ha representing 6.1 m2/ha BA (P. ponderosa ¼ 13.8
trees/ha and 4.8 m2/ha BA, Q. gambelii ¼ 31.2 trees/ha
and 1.26 m2/ha BA, and J. osteosperma ¼ 0.55 trees/ha
and 0.05 m2/ha BA) remained alive in the control from
1996/1997 to 2003.
The oldest living tree found in the study area was a pon-
derosa pine that was alive in 1455 (no pith on core) and
the oldest oak had a center date of 1645; both were alive
in 2003. In the treated area, 1.2% of the living pines and
0.5% of the living oaks were 200 years or older in 1996/
1997 compared to 2.8% (pine) and 0.4% (oak) in 2003.
Nineteen percent of the pines and 40% of the oaks 200
years or older died after treatment. In the control, 1.4% of
the living pines were 200 years or older in 1996/1997 com-
pared to 1.3% in 2003. Oaks that were 200 years or older
comprised 0.3% of the living oaks in both time periods.
Six percent of the pines and none of the oaks 200 years or
older died by 2003 in the control. In sum, these results
show that mortality of pre-settlement pines was only
slightly greater in the treated area compared to the con-
trol, although oaks were much more susceptible to mortal-
ity than pines.
The diameter distribution of the treated forest shifted
toward the historical distribution (Fig. 3). In 1870, ponder-
osa pines <30 cm dbh comprised only 6% of the total
trees/ha in the treated area and only 8% of the total trees/
ha in the control. In the treated area, ponderosa pines
<30 cm dbh comprised 40% of the overall total trees/ha
prior to treatment and comprised 24% of the overall total
in 2003. Seventy-seven percent of the pines thinned were
from diameter classes <30 cm at breast height. In the con-
trol, 60% of the trees were <30 cm dbh in both 1996/1997
and 2003. On thinned and burned plots, pines <30 cm
comprised only 16% of the overall total trees/ha in 2003
(Fig. 4).
Snag densities increased somewhat in the control (snags
>30 cm dbh increased 19% and snags >50 cm dbh in-
creased 40%) but substantially in the treated area (snags
>30 cm dbh increased 95% and snags >50 cm dbh
increased 45%) (Table 3). Log densities increased slightly
in the control (logs >30 cm dbh increased 4% and logs
>50 cm dbh increased 30%) but decreased in the treated
area (logs >30 cm dbh decreased 20% and logs >50 cm
dbh decreased 27%) (Table 3). No signiﬁcant differences
were found.
Regeneration was highly variable: minimum per-plot
regeneration density was zero in both the treated and the
control areas and in both time periods. Standard errors
were high relative to means (Table 4). Gambel oak and
New Mexico locust (both resprouting species) dominated
regeneration before and after treatment, whereas ponder-
osa, pinyon, and juniper had substantially lower densities.
Combining all three height categories and all species
(Table 4), regeneration decreased by 9% in the control
and 2% in the treated area between the two time periods.
For stems <2 m in height in the treated area, locust
increased by 49% after treatment, whereas oak decreased
by 12% and ponderosa pine decreased by 74%. No signiﬁ-
cant differences were found.
Canopy cover (Table 5) was not signiﬁcantly different
(Z ¼ 0.3, p ¼ 0.7) between the treated area and the con-
trol area in 1996/1997 but was signiﬁcantly reduced (Z ¼
6.0, p < 0.0001) in the treated area by 2003. Canopy cover
in the treated area was reduced from a pre-treatment
average of 54% to a post-treatment average of 32%.
There was little change in the control, which remained at
about 55%. The 2003 control had areas that were rela-
tively open (minimum per-plot value ¼ 9%) and the 2003
treated
area
had
areas
that
were
relatively
dense
Figure 2. An interpolation of BA across the study area illustrates the
mosaic of density: (A) relatively open in 1870 but (B) highly dense

forest structure closer to the reference 1870 patterns in the treated
area. The control area is in the lower half of the landscape.

(maximum per-plot value ¼ 78%); these values repre-
sented outliers in each dataset. Canopy cover for plots
that were thinned and burned decreased from a pre-treat-
ment average of 54% to a post-treatment average of 25%
(Table 5). Total BA explained 47% (adjusted r2) of the
variation in canopy cover (y ¼ 0.0099x 1 0.2051; n ¼ 233).
Discussion
Were the Restoration Treatments Implemented as Planned?
The treated area in 2003 closely resembled the original
plan written in 1995 to thin and burn 433 ha within the
approximately 700-ha treated area by 1998. About 94% of
the area originally planned for restoration treatments was
treated in some manner by 2003. Of these 409 treated hec-
tares, 74% (304 ha) were thinned and burned, 4% (15 ha)
burned only, and 22% (90 ha) thinned only. Treatment
progress was slower than expected due to conﬂicting con-
cerns of environmental groups, ranchers and forest work-
ers (Fule´ 2003), and operational delays (e.g., few bids on
thinning contracts, brief burning windows). There were
some notable changes to the original plan. Beginning in
1997, a nested, stand-scale study was introduced (Waltz
et al. 2003) in which two small patches (24 ha total) were
set aside as controls within the original treatment area and
were not treated. Other areas were burned only (not
thinned) due to the presence of archeological sites or were
thinned only because they had not yet been burned by our
measurement in 2003.
Post-treatment ponderosa pine tree density was 111–
256% greater than the targeted outcome in the treated
area; however, when only fully treated (thinned and
burned) plots were analyzed, tree density exceeded the
targeted residual density by only 10–85%. Pine density
averaged 76 pines/ha on thinned and burned plots, which
falls within the range (43–138 pines/ha) of post-treatment
pine density found in other restoration studies (Lynch et al.
2000; Fule´ et al. 2002a; Waltz et al. 2003; Youngblood et al.
2006).
Despite the termination of oak cutting early in the
project, an average of 32 oaks/ha (0.5 m2/ha BA) or 10%
of living oaks were thinned, including 10 oaks/ha (0.25
m2/ha BA) greater than 15 cm dbh. Cut oaks were
detected on 34% of the plots within the treated area and
were widely dispersed, probably for several reasons:
First, the decision to stop cutting oak was made after
contracts for about 150 ha of the treated area had already
been established (R. Davis 2003, BLM, St. George, UT,
personal communication). Second, because Gambel oak
provides valuable fuelwood, some trees were cut illegally
(A. Wilkerson 2003, BLM, St. George, UT, personal
communication). Finally, small oaks may have been cut
by operators to ensure the safe removal of ponderosa
pine trees. Fewer than 3 trees/ha (0.2 m2/ha BA) of pin-
yon or locust were cut during restoration treatments, and
no juniper trees were cut.
With the exception of the oak cutting, the thinning
prescription was designed to retain the living trees of
non-pine species with the assumption that prescribed ﬁre
would thin these species. Twenty percent of the density
and 80% of the BA of Gambel oak died following restora-
tion treatments, indicating that a greater proportion of
larger oaks was killed compared to smaller ones. Two-
thirds of the density and 40% of the BA of New Mexico
locust died.

Pre-settlement trees are, for practical purposes, irre-
placeable (DellaSalla et al. 2004) and were not intended
to be cut in this project. These ‘‘legacy’’ trees provide
genetic and structural diversity to the ecosystem and take
centuries to replace (Moore et al. 1999; DellaSalla et al.
2004). The goals of the thinning prescription were to avoid
any cutting of pre-settlement trees of any species and to
protect them during prescribed burning. BLM ﬁre pre-
scriptions set a goal of not exceeding 10% mortality of
pre-settlement pines. For oaks, the goal was to avoid ignit-
ing clumps. Despite this, a total of ﬁve (6%/ha) of the
pre-settlement pines and 11 of the pre-settlement oaks
(4%/ha) alive prior to treatment were cut. However, none
of the ﬁve pines had viable increment cores and were,
therefore, determined to be pre-settlement in the recon-
struction model based on size rather than age, meaning

that these trees may have been younger, black-barked,
but large trees. No ponderosa pine with a conﬁrmed pre-
1870 center date was cut. In contrast, most of the cut, pre-
settlement oaks had viable cores with a pre-1870 center
date. Although the cutting of any of the old trees is a con-
cern, it appears that oak cutting may be a more pressing
issue than pine cutting.
Thirteen percent of the pre-settlement pines/ha died in
the treated area by 2003, slightly exceeding the maximum
outlined by managers. In the same period, 9% of the pre-
settlement pines/ha died in the control, indicating that
pre-settlement pines in the control were almost as vulner-
able to mortality as those trees exposed to thinning and
burning treatments. Although mortality may be partly
attributed to factors such as drought and bark beetles,
a treatment-related cause is likely the heat effects of pre-
scribed ﬁre (Fule´ et al. 2002b, Jerman et al. 2004). Oak
mortality was skewed toward the treated landscape: 21%
of pre-settlement oaks/ha died in the treated area by 2003
compared to only 5% in the control. Recommendations to
avoid burning on lava soils (Fule´ et al. 2002b) and to crush
slash to reduce scorch (Jerman et al. 2004) are being
incorporated in future treatment design.
Because large snags and downed logs provide impor-
tant habitat, organic matter, and nutrients (Reynolds
et al. 1992; Chambers 2002), the project goals were to
retain at least 75% of the snags >50 cm dbh and at least
50% of the logs >50 cm dbh following burning (T. Duck
2003, BLM, St. George, UT, personal communication).
Two-thirds of the snags >50 cm dbh remained standing in
2003. Although this was below the goal, new snag recruit-
ment resulted in a 45% net increase in large snags.
Youngblood et al. (2006) also observed an increase in
snags following thinning and burning treatments in
northeastern Oregon. Eight percent of the snags >50 cm
dbh were cut and 8% were consumed. Sixty-ﬁve percent
of the logs >50 cm dbh were retained and thus implemen-
tation goals for large logs were achieved. Most of the
changes in snag density were due to prescribed burning,
but snags were occasionally felled for safety reasons, and
there was at least one documented incident of illegal cut-
ting (T. Duck 2003, BLM, St. George, UT, personal com-
munication). Changes in log density were fully attributed
to prescribed ﬁre.
Were the Treatments Effective?
Restoration treatments were not implemented totally to
speciﬁcations, but the desired goal of restoring open forest
structure while preserving most of the old trees was
achieved. Total tree density was reduced by nearly half,
and total BA was reduced by more than one-third in the
treated area. However, density levels remained more than
three times greater and BA more than double the 1870 val-
ues. The diameter distribution of ponderosa pine, while still
skewed
compared
to
reconstructed
distributions,
was
reduced in the proportion of smaller trees, especially when
untreated and partially treated plots were excluded. Diam-
eters of ponderosa pine on thinned and burned plots were
unimodally distributed, as in 1870. Youngblood et al.
(2006) also observed a change from a reverse J-shaped to
a normal diameter distribution for ponderosa pine follow-
ing thinning and burning treatments in northeastern Ore-
gon. Finally, although some pre-settlement trees died after
treatment, the majority survived and will likely be less sus-
ceptible to disease and insect attack (Wallin et al. 2004).
Current tree regeneration densities are within the range
recommended by Bailey and Covington (2002) to sustain
desired forest structure and composition. The proliﬁc
regeneration of oak and locust could lead to deciduous
dominance (Barton 2002), but subsequent burns are ex-
pected to continue to thin these species, and the density of
seed-producing trees found in the treated area (7.3 >65-cm
trees/ha) exceeds restoration targets (1–2 >65-cm trees/ha)
suggested by Bailey and Covington (2002). Although pon-
derosa
pine
seedling
regeneration
was
substantially
reduced in the treated area, the inventory of 26.3 total pine
seedlings/ha indicates that pine seedling density was sufﬁ-
cient for maintenance in pre-settlement times of 0.4–3.6
seedlings/ha/decade found by Mast et al. (1999). Waltz
et al. (2003) also noted a substantial reduction of ponderosa
pine regeneration following restoration treatments at
Mt. Trumbull.
Canopy cover values in the 2003 treated area were con-
sistent with pre-settlement values found near Flagstaff,
Arizona, of 17% estimated by Covington and Sackett
(1986) and 22% estimated by White (1985) and those
found in other ponderosa pine restoration studies (Fule´
et al. 2002a, 2005; Waltz et al. 2003). Canopy cover values
from this study were lower than those found on Rainbow
and Powell Plateaus—two sites at Grand Canyon National
Park that have had relatively intact ﬁre regimes and

serve as reasonable reference sites for Mt. Trumbull (Fule´
et al. 2002c, 2003). Canopy cover was also signiﬁcantly
reduced in Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forests follow-
ing thinning and burning treatments, although the post-
treatment value of 50% was much greater than in this
study (Stephens & Moghaddas 2005). Reduced canopy
cover, tree density, and ladder fuels all have implica-
tions for changing ﬁre behavior as well (Fule´ et al. 2001b;
Roccaforte et al. 2008).
Conclusions
This study provided the ﬁrst detailed information regard-
ing the implementation and effectiveness of landscape-
scale ecological restoration treatments in a southwestern
ponderosa pine forest. The treated area at Mt. Trumbull
was structurally more heterogeneous and more similar to
pre-1870 conditions than the untreated control. From
related ﬁner-scale studies, there is reason to expect that
these changes will result in improved ecosystem function
(Covington et al. 1997; Kaye et al. 2005), increased vigor
of old and young trees (Feeney et al. 1998; Stone et al.
1999; Skov et al. 2004), improved resistance to distur-
bance agents such as bark beetles (Wallin et al. 2004)
and ﬁre (Fule´
et al. 2001a), sufﬁcient regeneration
(Bailey & Covington 2002), and increased productivity
of herbaceous understory vegetation (Covington et al.
1997; Laughlin et al. 2006; Moore et al. 2006). However,
treatments have also resulted in the loss of some old
trees from prescribed ﬁre activities (Fule´ et al. 2002b;
Jerman et al. 2004) and the spread of the invasive exotic
Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) (McGlone et al. 2009).

mixed to date, with beneﬁcial and negative aspects
depending on the animal species and scale of study
(Germaine & Germaine 2002; Battin 2003; Germaine
et al. 2004; Waltz & Covington 2004; Wightman &

Evolution of treatments is common in broad-scale,
extended management projects, but it is rare to have
access to detailed data from permanent plots to assess
changes. Lessons from this study include, ﬁrst, that ongo-
ing monitoring can be very helpful in identifying prob-
lems. We determined relatively early that cutting of oaks
and heat effects of burning were issues of concern. Sec-
ond, even after identifying issues, there can be an adminis-
trative lag until changes take effect. Oaks in thinning
contract areas, for instance, were thinned even after the
decision was made to stop. Third, our data have identiﬁed
new areas on which to focus attention in restoration treat-
ments. Old ponderosa pines were largely uninjured, but
old oak trees had a high rate of mortality. Future projects
should maintain pine protection while addressing oak sur-
vival more explicitly. Fourth, monitoring offers quantita-
tive data that can serve as the basis for decisions about
future treatments. The Mt. Trumbull area contains addi-
tional dense ponderosa pine forests. Managers planning
future restoration treatments can draw upon these lessons
for developing new treatments and modifying existing pre-
scriptions. Finally, and this is a key point, even after
nearly 10 years of treatment and monitoring, the work is
not ﬁnished and the ecosystem is not ‘‘restored.’’ Ongoing
monitoring, maintenance of the surface ﬁre regime, and
continued management to address ecological effects of cli-
mate change, fragmentation, exotic species, and recrea-
tional use will remain important indeﬁnitely.

Canopy cover was estimated for one plot based on another plot with similar
density and BA for 1996/1997 treated. Thin and Burn (T&B) are a subset of
plots within the treated area that were both thinned and burned. Canopy cover
was tested for differences between treatments in each year using Wilcoxon
two-sample tests. Within each year, different letters indicate signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent means (p < 0.05). Statistical testing was not performed for T&B plots.
Monitoring Landscape-Scale Ponderosa Pine Restoration Treatment

NOVEMBER 2010

Implications for Practice
d AM requires monitoring of treatments and incorpo-
ration of the results to improve future restoration ef-
forts; this study is an example of monitoring for AM
in a frequent ﬁre-adapted pine–oak ecosystem, a for-
est type at risk from severe ﬁre worldwide.
d Restoration treatments effectively restored open for-
est structure conditions while preserving most of the
old trees across a large, well-measured landscape.
d Treatments were not implemented totally to speciﬁ-
cations resulting in pine density 111–256% above the
targeted residual density across the entire treated
area; however, when only thinned and burned plots
were analyzed, the targeted residual density was ex-
ceeded by only 10–85%.
d Based on the results of this study, managers should
be aware that oaks may be more susceptible to mor-
tality than pines. If retaining oaks is important, treat-
ments may need to be modiﬁed to protect them.
