Abstract—One of the most prevalent land-use practices in the
American Southwest, and one of the most contentious issues among
land-use policymakers, is the grazing of domestic livestock. In an
effort to contribute scientific understanding to this debate, we have
designed experiments comparing the effects of alternative grazing
regimes on plant communities. In a semiarid grassland of northern
Arizona, we have implemented a replicated study of four treat-
ments: (1) low-intensity, long-duration grazing rotations; (2) high-
intensity, short-duration rotations (Holistic Resource Management-
style grazing); (3) very high intensity, short duration grazing (to
simulate herd impact); and (4) livestock exclosure. Beginning in
1997, we conducted annual surveys of the plant communities with
Modified-Whittaker plots. Preliminary results suggest that
interannual variability affecting all study plots is high, and that
these alternative management strategies do not have dramatic
short-term effects on the plant community. Comparisons of native
and exotic species richness, as well as ground cover of grasses and
forbs, showed no consistent pattern due to treatment over a 3-year
period. Our results suggest that the effects of alternative livestock
management styles in the semiarid grasslands studied are modest,
at least in the short-term, and that future plant monitoring pro-
grams would greatly benefit from a multiscale sampling design.
Introduction ____________________
Semiarid grasslands are diverse and productive ecosys-
tems that have been subjected to anthropogenic forces for
over a century. Among the many perturbations affecting
these systems, the grazing of domestic livestock has been
recognized as the most pervasive (Fleischner 1994). Al-
though the effects of grazing have been studied for over a
century, little consensus has been reached with regard to
grazing’s impact on grassland composition and productiv-
ity, due in part to the difficulty of separating the effects of

livestock from tremendous interannual variation in climatic
patterns. While some studies have found grazing to be the
primary determinant of plant community composition (for
example, Conley and others 1992; Fuhlendorf and Smeins
1997), others have found climatic patterns to outweigh
grazing effects (for example, Gibbens and Beck 1988; Herbel
and others 1972). Moreover, the interactions of climatic
variation and grazing disturbances may exacerbate the
changes in grassland plant communities (Fuhlendorf and
Smeins 1997).
Within this sphere of unpredictable climatic events, hu-
mans endeavor towards sustainable land-use practices, but
in many cases we fail due to our ignorance of the complex
array of forces, both natural and anthropogenic, operating in
all ecosystems. Certainly the last century of fire prevention
programs in the forests of the American Southwest are a
testament to our efforts to eliminate or control disturbance,
but as a consequence, we have placed many forest ecosys-
tems in tenuous states where they are prone to catastrophic
fire (Covington and others 1994). Scientists and public alike
recognize a need to restore disturbance cycles to many
natural systems. However, efforts to restore grasslands
have been slow at best, and degradation by land-use activi-
ties are so acute that they have become a global conservation
priority (Samson and Knopf 1996). Noss and others (1995)
concluded that grasslands were among the most endangered
ecosystems in the United States, and of those ecotypes that
were most severely degraded, grasslands suffered areal
losses that were threefold greater than any other ecosystem.
Likely explanations of this decline include their widespread
use for agriculture and development, and the commonly
assigned low aesthetic value that has translated into a low
priority for conservation (Samson and Knopf 1996).
The Southwest has nearly one million acres of arid and
semiarid grasslands, but unfortunately our understanding
of their ecology is fairly superficial, especially of the effect of
large mammal herbivory such as domestic livestock. By
some accounts the number of cattle on rangelands of the
Western United States doubled, from 25.5 to 54.4 million
head between 1940 and 1990 (Belsky and others 1999),
affecting approximately 70 percent of the land surface in the
Western States (Fleischner 1994), and 86 percent of the land
in Arizona (Mayes and Archer 1982).
Surprisingly little is known about the effects of varying
intensities of livestock grazing on the biological diversity of
semiarid grasslands. Although many studies have exam-
ined the effects of livestock on the soils, vegetation, and birds

of riparian areas (Berendse 1999; Saab and others 1995;
Trimble and Mendel 1995), this information cannot be ap-
plied to grassland systems because upland grasslands differ
substantially, both in structure and function, from riparian
ecosystems. In addition, Hastings and Turner (1965) have
presented compelling photographic evidence that the last
century has seen a transformation over large areas of the
Southwest, of grasslands to woody shrublands. While eco-
logical impacts from current livestock grazing practices are
widespread and ongoing, it is important to recognize that
the greatest damage from overgrazing appears to have
taken place in the 1890s (Wildeman and Brock 2000).
Because livestock grazing can be conducted at varying
intensities, it is likely that some management techniques
alter biological diversity more than others. The standard
method for measuring such effects has been to establish
exclosures and conduct pairwise comparisons of species
richness and ground cover (Hughes 1996). Because of the
tremendous variability in responses as seen in the litera-
ture, it is exceedingly difficult for land managers to confi-
dently proceed with grazing management plans. In addition
to the confounding effects of variable climatic patterns
mentioned previously, numerous criticisms have been di-
rected at previous grazing studies, including the small size
of exclosures (Fleischner 1994), a lack of standard methods
for measuring grazing intensity (Fleischner 1994), changes
in the behavior of small herbivores and granivores
(McNaughton 1983), and poor experimental design (Stohlgren
and others 1998). Stohlgren and others (1998) address many
of the sampling design concerns and draw specific attention
to inadequate assessment of spatial heterogeneity of land-
scapes. In grassland ecosystems, choosing the appropriate
spatial scale at which to measure a given response variable
is not trivial, yet the majority of plant diversity studies have
arbitrarily chosen sample plots of 1 m2 or less (Stohlgren and
others 1998). Collins and Glenn (1997) have demonstrated
that measures of local species richness generated from a 1 m2
plot often correlate poorly with landscape-scale species rich-
ness. Similarly, Stohlgren and others (1998) compared com-
mon rangeland vegetation sampling techniques and found
the traditional, fine-scale measurements to greatly under-
estimate rare or patchily distributed species.
To address many of the problems associated with previous
study designs, we initiated an experiment with both spatial
and temporal replication. This paper addresses three key
issues in the study of livestock grazing impacts:
• Does increasing intensity of livestock grazing have a
consistent effect on the ground cover and species rich-
ness of both native and exotic grasses and forbs?
• Do grazing treatments cause a predictable shift in
species composition of the overall plant community?
• Can our sampling techniques and models of plant spe-
cies richness be scaled accurately to reflect conditions of
larger landscapes?
Methods _______________________
Site Description
Located at 2,160 m elevation and approximately 32 km
southeast of Flagstaff in north-central Arizona, the Reed
Lake field site occupies Upper Great Basin grassland (Brown
1994) at the edge of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest.
The dominant perennial grasses are Agropyron smithii and
Elymus elymoides. A vertisol soil occurs across the entirety
of the 25-ha study site. Annual precipitation averages be-
tween 300 and 460 mm and is approximately evenly divided
between winter and the July–September monsoons (Brown
1994).
Experimental Design
Meaningful application of science to grazing issues will
require comparisons of the effects of actual management
practices (“treatments”) as well as experimental treatments
designed to elucidate the relationships between grazing and
important ecosystem variables. Our experimental design,
replicated in time and space, consists of four treatments in
three blocks on the landscape (Sisk and others 1999). The
four treatments are (abbreviations shown in parenthe-
ses): (1) conventional low-intensity, long-duration graz-
ing rotations (CON); (2) high-intensity, short-duration
rotations informed by the principles of Holistic Resource
Management (HRM, see Savory 1988); (3) very high-inten-
sity, short-duration grazing to simulate herd impact (VHI);
and (4) livestock exclosure (EXC).
Stocking rates and rotations for the first two treatments
are determined by ranchers on adjoining pastures, while the
latter two treatments are implemented on experimental
plots by researchers and ranchers. Instead of manipulat-
ing small plots in a way thought to mimic range manage-
ment, we are working on active ranches, where we have
carefully selected matched sites in which spatially and
temporally extensive treatment effects can be complemented
with 1-ha EXC and VHI treatments. Of the four treatments,
only the VHI treatment is not a simulation of a current
grazing policy; it serves as a critical upper-end treatment
representing a ranching practice that could be implemented
only with open-range herding. Its primary purpose is to help
identify mechanistic relationships and inform interpreta-
tion of results from all treatments.
Plant Surveys
To measure plant community patterns, we established a
Modified-Whittaker plot in each treatment plot (fig. 1;
Stohlgren and others 1995). The Modified-Whittaker plot
samples the heterogeneity of plant communities with a
higher level of accuracy then either true random sampling
or the original Whittaker plot design (Stohlgren and others
1995). This sampling design involves a 1,000 m2 plot with
nested subplots consisting of one 100 m2, two 10 m2, and ten
1 m2 subplots (fig. 1). Our version of the Modified-Whittaker
plot differs slightly from the design proposed by Stohlgren
and others (1995) in that we have placed four of the 1 m2
subplots within the central 100 m2 plot. Each Modified-
Whittaker plot has been measured annually since 1997,
with surveys conducted between mid-July and early Sep-
tember. The 1 m2 plots were surveyed with a 50-point
frequency frame (Mueller-Dombois and Ellenberg 1974)
that provided a more objective measurement of ground
cover by species and a more comprehensive species list

than could be obtained with visual estimates. Only species
lists were assembled for the 10 m2, 100 m2, and 1,000 m2
plots. Plant identifications were referenced with the Deaver
Herbarium located at Northern Arizona University in
Flagstaff, AZ, and voucher specimens were retained in the
Sisk Laboratory. Of the approximately 80 plant species
found at the Reed Lake site, 15 could not be identified due
to poor specimens but were considered unique species and
therefore included in overall estimates of species diversity.
Grass Versus Forb—Three years of detailed plant com-
munity data have generated a wealth of information, and
here we present only a subset. We calculated trends in
ground cover estimates for the two primary functional groups,
grasses and forbs, using data collected from the 1 m2 plots
over all 3 years. Data were transformed with an arcsine
(square root) function prior to analysis (Sokal and Rohlf
1995), but are presented as percentages. A repeated-mea-
sures ANOVA was conducted for each functional group
(Sokal and Rohlf 1995).
Native Versus Exotic—To address the issue of whether
livestock grazing management techniques affect the estab-
lishment of exotic species, we calculated the number of
native and exotic species in each treatment for each of the 3
years. In addition, we calculated the total ground cover of
native and exotic species by treatment and year. A repeated-
measures ANOVA was conducted for species richness and
ground cover.
Community-Level Analysis—To determine whether
treatment was having a predictable effect on overall plant
diversity, we used 3 years of 1-m2 subplot data to calculate
three indices, as described in Magurran (1988). First, we
calculated values for the Shannon-Wiener index of diversity
based on the proportional abundance of species, with higher
values suggesting more species and greater evenness. Sec-
ond, we estimated evenness by comparing the observed
diversity to the maximum potential diversity. Values fall
between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating a more
evenly distributed community. Third, we calculated the
Simpson’s index, which is weighted towards the more domi-
nant species and is fairly insensitive to differences in rare
species. All calculations were made based on Magurran
(1988).
As suggested by Stohlgren and others (1998), we esti-
mated the similarity of plant communities between treat-
ments using Jaccard’s Coefficient (signified as J, Krebs
1989). Jaccard’s Coefficient (or index) is a standard similar-
ity index that indicates the amount of overlap between the
communities of any pair of sites. Within each replicate, we
compared the CON treatment to each of the other three
treatments and calculated the corresponding Jaccard’s Co-
efficient. We chose to use the CON treatment as the “control”
because it represents the most common grazing manage-
ment style for Southwestern rangelands, both historically
and currently (Kruse and Jemison 2000), while other treat-
ments are more recent deviations from this management.
The J value was then calculated for each 1,000 m2 plot
comparison and averaged across all three replicates. A J
value of 1.0 would represent complete overlap of species
between two sites.
Another useful product from the nested design of the
Modified-Whittaker plots is the ability to generate species-
area curves. Species-area curves have the very practical
application of extrapolating total species richness to areas
much larger then the plots in which the plant surveys were
conducted. One standard variant of the species-area curve is
defined as:
y = m(log Area) + b
where y is the number of species, m is the slope of the line,
and b is a constant. However, Stohlgren and others (1997)
have demonstrated that a corrected species-area curve pro-
vides a far more accurate extrapolation of plant species to
large areas:
y = (m/J) (log Area) + b
where J is the mean Jaccard’s Coefficient. We calculated the
species-area curve for each treatment based on 1999 data
from the 1 m2, 10 m2, and 100 m2 plots. We then calculated
the J value based on the species lists of each 1,000 m2 plot

within a treatment and used the average J value to correct
the original species area curves. The estimated species
richness for an area of 3,000 m2 was calculated using both
the standard (uncorrected) species-area curve and the cor-
rected species-area curve and compared to the observed
species richness of the three 1,000 m2 plots summed together.
The final analysis of the plant community data was
conducted with a relatively new ordination technique of
demonstrated utility, nonmetric multidimensional scaling
(NMDS, Minchin 1987). Based upon NMDS, Minchin (1987)
developed a simulation procedure that makes it possible to
model patterns of variation in community composition along
ecological gradients. We used species abundance data from
the 1 m2 plots of all 3 years to compare communities of
each plot to one another.
Results ________________________
Grass Versus Forb Cover
If cattle graze grasses more commonly than forbs (Stuth
1991), then a moderate intensity of grazing may limit grasses
from becoming the dominant ground cover. In this scenario,
forbs may have higher germination success in areas where
some grazing occurs because grasses aren’t able to hoard
resources such as light and nutrients (Collins and others
1998). We analyzed ground cover data from our 1-m2 plots
for total grass and forb cover across all treatments and years.
Since the initiation of the study in 1997, grass cover appears
to have increased roughly 10 percent. However, this change
was not statistically significant (fig. 2; df = 3, F = 0.540, p =
0.668). In contrast, forb cover appears to be decreasing by
approximately 20 percent, but again this trend is not statis-
tically significant (fig. 2; df = 3, F = 0.697, p = 0.579).
Although neither trend demonstrated clear statistical sig-
nificance, both suggest changes that occurred due to yearly
patterns rather than treatment effects.
Native Versus Exotic Richness and Cover
Exotic plants are generally considered to be successful
colonizers of disturbed habitats, and high intensities of
livestock grazing have been suggested to increase
invasibility (Hobbs and Huenneke 1992). To explore this
hypothesis, we first computed the total native and exotic
species richness from our 1 m2 plots for each treatment by
Figure 2—Percent ground cover by year and treat-
ment for grasses and forbs as calculated from 1 m2
subplot data. Treatment shows no significant effect
for either grasses or forbs, but climatic patterns
appear to be benefiting grasses to the detriment of
forbs. Standard error bars are not shown because
they overlap for all treatments within any given year
indicating no statistically significant differences

year. No statistically significant differences were found
within years (table 1; 1997: df = 3, F = 1.933, p = 0.165; 1998:
df = 3, F = 1.274, p = 0.317; 1999: df = 3, F = 0.917, p = 0.455).
Similarly, ground cover by natives and exotics from our
1 m2 plots did not show significant differences among
treatments within years (table 1; 1997: df = 3, F = 1.525,
p = 0.213; 1998: df = 3, F = 2.434, p = 0.103; 1999: df = 3,
F = 0.254, p = 0.952).

Diversity Indices
Assessing diversity can be done with many different
analytical approaches, but perhaps the most common meth-
ods involve the calculation of diversity indices. Although
ubiquitous in the ecological literature, diversity indices can
be difficult to interpret because they are often codependant
on species richness and species evenness. We have calcu-
lated the means and standard errors for each treatment, by
year, for the Shannon-Wiener index, Evenness, and Simpson’s
Diversity. As displayed in table 2, treatments are fairly
similar, regardless of index or year. These data are provided
as descriptive information and no statistical tests were
conducted.
Furthermore, to determine if alternative management
styles, namely EXC, HRM, and VHI treatments, exhibited
predictable patterns of unique species we calculated the
Jaccard’s Coefficient by comparing each alternative treat-
ment plot with its partnered CON treatment plot. There was
moderate similarity between plant communities in treat-
ments, with an average of 60 percent overlap of species and
less than 6 percent standard deviation (fig. 3).
Community-Level Comparisons
In addition to difficulties in analysis and interpretation, it
is difficult to graphically display information from diversity
indices. Instead, we display community data through ordi-
nation techniques, and we statistically tested the patterns
with nonmetric multidimensional scaling. While no treat-
ment effects were found to be significant, a strongly signifi-
cant pattern was discovered for plant communities when
analyzed by year. The data suggest that the plant communi-
ties differ significantly among years regardless of treatment
type (fig. 4).
Species-Area Curves
It is commonplace in the ecological literature to ex-
trapolate results from small-scale studies to larger land-
scapes. While most sampling methods fail to provide a

framework for extrapolating data, the nested design of
the Modified-Whittaker plot is ideally suited to these
efforts. Extrapolations employing the species-area equa-
tion, corrected with Jaccard’s Coefficient, were more accu-
rate than extrapolations with the uncorrected species-
area curve. More specifically, the uncorrected species-area
curve tended to underestimate the plant community by
roughly 20 species, whereas the corrected species-area
curve underestimated by as few as three and no more than
13 (table 3).

of specific patterns and processes. Milchunas and Lauenroth
(1993) summarized 152 studies in grasslands and found
sharply contrasting results with respect to the responses of
species composition to large-herbivore grazing. The authors
suggested that these conflicting findings may be due to one
or more of the following explanations: (1) differing method-
ologies, including the intensity of grazing and the scale at
which the response variable was measured; (2) the produc-
tivity of the grassland, which includes its soil resources and
moisture; and (3) the evolutionary history of each grassland
type (Milchunas and Lauenroth 1993). This paper most
directly addresses the first, that is, the appropriate method-
ology for measuring grassland community responses to
grazing treatments.

mined with nonmetric multidimensional scaling. Each

more dissimilar will be found farther apart than those

significant. However groupings of plant communities by
year that ignore treatment are statistically significant.

Grass Versus Forb Cover
Shifts in the proportional ground cover of plant functional
groups as a function of grazing intensity have been well
documented in highly productive sites. Long-term research
conducted in the tallgrass prairies of Kansas demonstrated
that perennial grasses created a near monoculture by
outcompeting forbs when disturbance events were elimi-
nated (Collins and others 1998). In comparatively less pro-
ductive ecosystems, such as semiarid grasslands, the inter-
actions of grasses and forbs are poorly understood. In one
study of a semiarid grassland, Brady and others (1989)
found ground cover increased for both grasses and forbs
following the removal of cattle. In contrast, Rambo and
Faeth (1999) found grass cover increased by 20 percent in
two of three sites when grazing was eliminated for at least
8 years. Our own work suggests no immediate differences in
grass or forb cover due to alternative grazing treatments.
However, across all treatments grass cover is increasing
while forb cover is decreasing. Although it may be too soon
to draw conclusions about the fairly recent treatments, EXC
and VHI, we have a higher level of confidence in comparing
CON and HRM treatments, which have been in place for a
minimum of 12 years. With 3 years of ground cover data, the
alternative HRM management style does not exhibit a
markedly different level of grass or forb cover.
Native Versus Exotic Richness and Cover
Although livestock grazing has often been implicated as a
dispersal agent for exotic species (Hobbs and Huenneke
1992; Mack 1981), several studies show no link between
grazing and exotic species richness. A multi-State sampling
effort in the Northern Rocky Mountains found no consistent
differences in native or exotic species richness due to live-
stock grazing (Stohlgren and others 1999). Similarly, in a
semiarid grassland, Rambo and Faeth (1999) found no
differences in exotic species richness in either long-term or
short-term grazing exclosures. Preliminary findings from
our work agree with these latter studies, showing no statis-
tical difference in either species richness or ground cover of
native or exotic species due to treatment. Our results do
show a consistent increase in the overall number of species

to include further cuts to monitoring budgets, even while
pressure grows to make ecologically sound decisions in the
face of increasing litigation. Our preliminary results allow
us to make two management suggestions, with the caveat
that our preliminary results are specific to the Reed Lake
study site, and should influence broader interpretations
only where they concur with other published works.
First, future monitoring efforts should heed the warning
that small sampling plots may provide significantly less
accurate information then multiscale, nested sampling plot
designs. At our study site, the use of Modified-Whittaker
plots and replicated treatments allowed us to improve our
species richness prediction accuracy by 45 percent. Efforts
are under way to apply this sampling design to other re-
sponse variables, including the diversity of macro- and
micro-arthropods, and the size and fluxes of nutrient pools.
Second, alternative livestock approaches, including
exclosures and very high intensity treatments, did not have
immediate or dramatic effects on the plant community of
this semiarid grassland. In fact, the HRM treatment that
has been in place for a dozen years shows no statistically
significant differences from the plant community of the
adjacent conventionally grazed grasslands. Therefore, if the
goal of a grassland management program is to move plant
communities in a particular direction with alternative graz-
ing practices, planners and practitioners must recognize the
necessity for a long-term commitment to treatments and to
an efficient, well targeted monitoring program.

from 1997 to 1999, which is likely to be a function of time
since a severe drought year in 1996. Although not statisti-
cally significant, it is interesting to note that the HRM
treatment had the lowest cover of exotic species in 2 of 3
years of sampling.
Plant Community Responses
By employing a variety of analytical tools we have demon-
strated that the plant communities in each treatment do not
differ significantly. This may be due to minimal ecological
impacts or it may be that the duration of this study is not yet
sufficient to detect ongoing, gradual change. Community
changes are difficult to document because they involve the
combination of species richness and the abundance of each
individual species. To address this issue we compared tradi-
tional diversity indices and employed more powerful ordina-
tion techniques. The standard diversity indices, Shannon-
Wiener, Evenness, and Simpson’s, suggest no consistent
differences among treatments. Furthermore, the species
overlap between the conventional treatment and each of
the other three treatments is nearly 60 percent for each
comparison.
The ordination of community data with NMDS also dem-
onstrated no significant differences due to treatment; how-
ever, there were strongly significant differences between
each year. This finding suggests that year-to-year variation
has had a stronger effect on the plant community than the
treatments themselves. Even though the EXC and VHI
treatments represent strikingly different livestock treat-
ments, and the CON and HRM treatments represent longer-
term, but less extreme treatments, the plant communities
have not shown a strong response to grazing intensity over
a 3-year period. Based on findings from other studies (for
example, Sala and others 1992), we suggest that the plant
community of this water-limited ecosystem is often more
sensitive to the high variability in precipitation and soil
moisture than to the livestock management treatments
compared in this study.
Improved Power with Nested Sampling
Stohlgren and others (1995, 1998) have demonstrated a
number of benefits from conducting multiscale nested sam-
pling in plant communities. Our results support their con-
clusions. For our semiarid grassland study site, standard
species-area curves consistently underestimated species rich-
ness by about 40 percent, and correcting the species-area
curve with Jaccard’s Coefficient improved estimates to
within 15 percent of the known species richness. If the goal
of a particular monitoring program is to estimate the total
number of species in a given area of grassland, then nested
sampling designs such as the Modified-Whittaker plot
should provide increased prediction accuracy.
Management Implications
Land managers appear to be increasingly placed in the
catch-22 situation of doing more with less. Especially in the
stewardship of public lands, the short-term future appears
