Abstract.
Ponderosa pine–bunchgrass ecosystems of the western United States were
altered following Euro-American settlement as grazing and ﬁre suppression facilitated pine
invasion of grassy openings. Pine invasion changed stand structure and ﬁre regimes, mo-
tivating restoration through forest thinning and prescribed burning. To determine effects
of restoration on soil nitrogen (N) transformations, we replicated (0.25-ha plots) the fol-
lowing experimental restoration treatments within a ponderosa pine–bunchgrass community
near Flagstaff, Arizona: (1) partial restoration—thinning to presettlement conditions, (2)
complete restoration—removal of trees and forest ﬂoor to presettlement conditions, native
grass litter addition, and a prescribed burn, and (3) control. Within treatments, we stratiﬁed
sampling to assess effects of canopy cover on N transformations. Forest ﬂoor net N min-
eralization and nitriﬁcation were similar among treatments on an areal basis, but higher in
restoration treatments on a mass basis. In the mineral soil (0–15 cm), restoration treatments
had 2–3 times greater annual net N mineralization and 3–5 times greater annual net nitri-
ﬁcation than the control. Gross N transformation measurements indicate that elevated net
N mineralization may be due to increased gross N mineralization, while elevated net ni-
triﬁcation may be due to decreased microbial immobilization of nitrate. Net N transfor-
mation rates beneath relict grassy openings were twice those beneath postsettlement pines.
These short-term (1 yr) results suggest that ecological restoration increases N transformation
rates and that prescribed burning may not be necessary to restore N cycling processes.

INTRODUCTION
Before Euro-American settlement, ponderosa pine–
bunchgrass ecosystems were characterized by frequent,
low-intensity ﬁres that rarely reached the crowns of
large trees. These ﬁres destroyed most pine regenera-
tion and maintained grassy openings between groups
of large pines. Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.)
forests of the inland western United States changed
dramatically following Euro-American settlement in
the late 1800s. Fire suppression, timber extraction, ex-
otic species introductions, and livestock grazing greatly
altered ecosystem patterns and processes (Cooper
1960, Covington and Moore 1994, Covington et al.
1994).
These anthropogenic factors, in conjunction with a
wet and warm climate in the early 1900s, led to an
irruption of pine regeneration, which reached its peak
in 1919 (White 1985, Savage et al. 1996). Abundant
and permanent establishment of pines in grassy open-
ings increased stand densities and forest ﬂoor litter ac-
cumulation, causing the ﬁre regime to become infre-
quent and stand-replacing (Covington and Moore 1994,

Covington et al. 1994, Swetnam and Baisan 1996).
Stand-replacing ﬁres, which were anomalous in pre-
settlement forests, threaten timber resources, adjacent
homes, and species or communities dependent on the
presettlement stand structure and ﬁre regime (Coving-
ton et al. 1994, Kolb et al. 1994, Covington et al. 1997).
In addition, sequestration of nutrients in pine litter that
decomposes more slowly than grass litter (Hunt et al.
1988) may have decreased nutrient availability in the
contemporary forest relative to the presettlement forest,
though this hypothesis is largely untested (Weaver
1951, Cooper 1960, Covington and Sackett 1984). Cov-
ington et al. (1994) suggested that ecological restora-
tion, if implemented within a 15–30 yr window, could
ameliorate the above problems.
Restoration efforts, including thinning of postsettle-
ment trees and prescribed burning, are becoming com-
mon in ponderosa pine–bunchgrass ecosystems (Cov-
ington and Sackett 1984, 1986, 1992, Kaufmann et al.
1994). However ecological effects of restoration, in-
cluding effects on linkages between aboveground res-
toration and belowground biogeochemical processes,
are poorly understood. Nitrogen (N) limits plant growth
in many ponderosa pine ecosystems (Wagle and Kitch-
en 1972), and both thinning (Vitousek and Matson
1985, Fisk and Fahey 1990, Frazer et al. 1990, Van
Miegroet et al. 1992) and prescribed burning (Chris-

tensen 1973, Klemmedson 1976, Covington and Sack-
ett 1984, 1986, 1992, White 1986, Binkley et al. 1992,
Carriera et al. 1994, Wright and Hart 1997) are known
to alter N availability. The effects of prescribed ﬁre
and thinning are rarely observed independently at the
same site (Pietika¨inen and Fritze 1995). In addition,
most researchers have used one-time estimates of N
pool sizes or laboratory estimates of net N transfor-
mation rates to assess changes in soil N; these measures
alone may be poor indices of plant-available N in situ
(Hart et al. 1994). Given the economic and ecological
importance of ponderosa pine forests, the scale of cur-
rent restoration efforts, and the importance of N to
ponderosa pine productivity, greater understanding of
restoration effects on the N cycle is a research imper-
ative in the Southwest (Covington et al. 1994, Cov-
ington et al. 1997).
This research evaluates how ecological restoration
of a ponderosa pine–bunchgrass ecosystem to preset-
tlement structure and function alters gross and net soil
N transformations. We established replicated experi-
mental restoration plots in a mature ponderosa pine
stand within the Gus Pearson Natural Area near Flag-
staff, Arizona (Covington et al. 1997). Within resto-
ration treatments, we stratiﬁed sampling under major
canopy cover types to assess changes in net N trans-
formations due to postsettlement pine invasion into
grassy openings.
METHODS
Study site and treatments
The research was conducted in the Gus Pearson Nat-
ural Area within the United States Forest Service Fort
Valley Experimental Forest, 10 km northwest of Flag-
staff, Arizona. The site elevation is 2195–2255 m, with
a southwest aspect and a slope of 0–5%. Mean annual
precipitation is 56.7 cm, half of which falls as snow
and half as summer monsoonal rains (Schubert 1974).
Mean annual air temperature is 7.58C, with an average
of 94 frost-free days. The soil is derived from ﬂow and
cinder basalt and is classiﬁed as Brolliar stony clay
loam, a ﬁne, smectitic, Typic Argiboroll. The area was
never logged, but livestock grazing occurred between
1876 and 1910. The dominant vegetation is ponderosa
pine forest composed of large (37–104 cm dbh) uneven-
aged presettlement pines surrounded by small (,37 cm
dbh) uneven-aged postsettlement pines or relict bunch-
grass openings. Before treatment, postsettlement trees
covered ;80% of the area relative to ;10% cover by
grassy openings and presettlement pines. Major her-
baceous species found in the relict bunchgrass openings
include: the grasses, Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica
Vasey),
mountain
muhly
(Muhlenbergia
montana
(Nutt.) Hitchc.), mutton bluegrass (Poa fendleriana
(Steud.)
Vasey),
pine
dropseed
(Blepharoneuron
tricholepis (Torr.) Nash.), black dropseed (Sporobolus
interruptus Vasey), and bottlebrush squirreltail (Sitan-
ion hysterix Nutt.); the forbs, showy aster (Aster com-
mutatus Torr. and Gray) spreading ﬂeabane (Erigeron
divergens Torr. and Gray), showy goldeneye (Viguiera
multiﬂora Nutt.), western ragweed (Ambrosia psilis-
tachya DC.), and snakeweed (Guterrezia spp.); and the
shrub, buckbrush (Ceanothus fendlerii Steud.).
Fifteen 0.25-ha plots were established and assigned
to three treatments: control, partial restoration, and
complete restoration. Because a fuel break was needed
to protect buildings of the historical Fort Valley Ex-
periment Station, the 10 restoration treatment plots
were assigned randomly (5 as partial restoration and 5
as complete restoration) to the plots closest to the build-
ings. The remaining 5 plots were assigned to the control
treatment. All areas had similar forest ﬂoor and mineral
soil total C and N contents, and mineral soil anaero-
bically mineralizable N before treatment (P. Z. Fule´
and S. C. Hart, 1993, Northern Arizona University un-
published data). Partial restoration included removing
most of the aboveground postsettlement tree biomass
from the site. Complete restoration included postset-
tlement tree removal, forest ﬂoor manipulation, and a
prescribed burn. Forest ﬂoor manipulation included
raking aside the Oi layer and removing the Oa and Oe
layers from the site. The Oi layer (2–4 yr of litterfall)
was then returned to the soil surface, along with ;672
kg/ha of native grasses and forbs mowed from nearby
Hart Prairie. These forest ﬂoor manipulations were in-
tended to emulate the fuel load of presettlement forests.
The complete restoration treatment was designed to test
whether ecosystem structure and function could be re-
stored quickly through intense manipulations (Coving-
ton et al. 1997). The partial restoration treatment was
designed to test whether thinning without prescribed
burning could restore ecosystem structure and function.
Thinning was implemented in the fall of 1993 and the
prescribed burn in the fall of 1994. More details on the
treatments and ﬁre are given in Covington et al. (1997).
Within each plot, we stratiﬁed sampling beneath
three or four canopy types. Canopy type sample areas
(subplots) were selected randomly from the population
of potential subplots for a given canopy type within
each plot. In all treatments, we located subplots beneath
presettlement pines, postsettlement pines, and in grassy
openings (n 5 3 treatments 3 3 canopy types 3 5
replicates 5 45 subplots). In the partial and complete
restoration treatments, subplots were also established
in areas where postsettlement pines had been removed
(called ‘‘postsettlement removed’’ subplots; n 5 2
treatments 3 1 canopy type 3 5 replicates 5 10 sub-
plots).
Nitrogen transformation measurements
We used a modiﬁed resin–core method (DiStefano
and Gholz 1986, Binkley and Hart 1989) to measure
net N transformation rates. This method uses ion ex-
change resin bags to capture soil solution ions leaching
below the incubating soil. Initial soil inorganic N pool

on the underlying resin bag. We incubated forest ﬂoor
and underlying mineral soil in 5.1 cm I.D. polyvinyl
chloride (PVC) pipe by placing resin bags below the
mineral soil and between the mineral soil and forest
ﬂoor. Resin bags were constructed by placing mixed
bed ion exchange resin (30 mL wet, Baker catalog num-
ber 4631-01) in a nylon stocking along with a ring of
latex tubing and tying the stocking closed. The latex
tubing ring pressed the bag against the PVC pipe to
ensure that the soil solution passed through the bag.
The forest ﬂoor was sampled with a polycarbonate tube
(4.75 cm I.D.) and then transferred to the PVC incu-
bation pipe. The depth of the forest ﬂoor core varied
because O horizon depths ranged from 0 to 18 cm. The
mineral soil was sampled with the same polycarbonate
tube (0–15 cm), using a soil sampling corer (AMS Core
Sampler, American Falls, Idaho, USA). The PVC pipe
was inverted, a resin bag was placed below the forest
ﬂoor, the intact mineral soil core was placed below the
resin bag, and a second resin bag was placed below
the mineral soil. This entire unit was returned to the
hole from which the soil was sampled and incubated
for 6 mo.
Soils were stored at 48C (,5 d) until they were
weighed and subsampled for gravimetric water content
and potassium chloride (KCl) extraction. Rock and or-
ganic fragments .5 mm were removed by hand before
subsampling. Gravimetric water content was deter-
mined by drying mineral soil for 48 h at 1058C and
forest ﬂoor for 24 h at 708C. We extracted ;20 mL of
ﬁeld moist soil with 100 (mineral soil) or 25 (forest
ﬂoor) mL of 2 mol/L KCl. Soil suspensions were me-
chanically shaken for 0.5 h, ﬁltered (Whatman No. 1
ﬁlters, preleached with deionized water), and frozen
until immediately prior to analysis. Pool sizes of am-

Rocks (2–5 mm) were accounted for by sieving KCl
extracts and gravimetric water content subsamples
through a 2-mm mesh following analysis. The ﬁrst
(summer) incubation took place from 2 May 1995
through 31 October 1995, while the second (winter)
incubation spanned 1 November 1995 through 16 May
1996. The two 6-mo incubation periods were selected
based on Arizona’s bimodal precipitation pattern de-
scribed above. Cores were incubated in each of the 55
subplots, at a ﬁxed distance (4 m) and random direction
from the center of the subplot. Mass-based rates within
each subplot were converted to an areal basis using the
mean bulk density of initial and ﬁnal mineral soil cores.
Forest ﬂoor mass per unit area was measured with a
929-cm2 sampling template (rather than our 17.7-cm2
surface area core) at each subplot.
The 15N isotope dilution method (Hart et al. 1994)
was used to measure gross N transformation rates on
intact mineral soil cores (0–15 cm) using the same soil
coring device as above, and a 1-d incubation period.
We conducted measurements beneath all canopy types
within two randomly selected plots from each treatment
(22 subplots total), during 30 and 31 August 1995.
These dates were chosen because the soil was moist
and warm, and we expected gross N transformation
rates to be highest at this time. At each subplot, we
labeled adjacent t0 and t24 cores with 15
(25 mg N/
1
NH4
L and 99% atom percentage enrichment), labeled ad-
jacent t0 and t24 cores with 15
(58 mg N/L and 26%

atom percentage enrichment), and left one centrally
located core unamended to determine initial
and

pool sizes. All ﬁve cores were taken within a 0.25-

m2 area. We injected 16 mL (;2 and 4 mg N/kg dry
soil for
and
cores, respectively) of 15N so-

lution uniformly into the intact soil cores and returned
the cores to their original space in the soil, where they
incubated for 24 h (Hart et. al. 1994).

lated using 14115N and 15N in t0 and t24 cores, pool sizes

combustion and mass spectrometry with an ANCA
2020 (Europa Scientiﬁc, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA).
Organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus
Organic matter and total N and phosphorus (P) were
determined in forest ﬂoor and mineral soil collected in
May, 1995. Organic matter was determined by mass

timated using the ratio of 1.724 g organic matter/g C
(Nelson and Sommers 1982). Total N (organic 1

(Lachat Instruments, Inc. 1992c) methods, respectively.
Microclimatic measurements
Volumetric water content was determined twice per
month from 16 May 1995 through 8 November 1995
using a Trace Systems (Soil Moisture Corp., Santa Bar-
bara, California, USA) time domain reﬂectometry
(TDR) unit (Topp et al. 1980). Soil water content was
determined at every subplot in the mineral soil (0–15
cm). Daily mean, minimum, and maximum soil tem-
peratures were measured at a depth of 7.5 cm into the
mineral soil using a CR10 Campbell Scientiﬁc (Camp-
bell Scientiﬁc Inc., Logan, Utah, USA) datalogger and
thermistors. Temperature measurements began 1 Jan-
uary 1995 in the control and 23 June 1995 in restoration
treatments and were conducted on all subplots within
two plots of each treatment.
Statistical analyses
Because the postsettlement removed canopy type did
not exist in the control treatment, we determined canopy
type differences by deleting postsettlement removed data
and analyzing presettlement, postsettlement retained,
and grass data as a two-way analysis of variance (ANO-
VA), with canopy type and treatment as factors. When
main effects were signiﬁcant (P , 0.10) and interactions
were not, Fisher’s LSD was used as a mean separation
test. To determine plot-scale treatment effects that in-
cluded the postsettlement removed canopy type, we
scaled all canopy-type data to the plot level using a
geographical information system (GIS). This GIS con-
tained the area within each plot occupied by a given
canopy type, allowing us to calculate the proportional
area of each canopy type within a plot. Once scaled to
the plot level, the data were analyzed using a one-way
ANOVA, with treatment as the factor. Due to the reduced
sample size in the 15N isotope dilution experiment, we
only used this scaling method when the effect of canopy
type was signiﬁcant (gross nitriﬁcation). When canopy
type was not signiﬁcant, we pooled data from all canopy
types and used a one-way ANOVA on treatment (gross
N mineralization, gross N immobilization, and gross
immobilization). Soil temperature and water con-
2
NO3
tent data were scaled using the GIS and then analyzed
using a repeated-measures ANOVA on treatment. We
log 10 transformed data for ANOVA analyses when vari-
ance was unequal among treatments and canopy types.
All statistical analyses were performed using the statis-
tical package StatView at the P 5 0.10 signiﬁcance level
(version 4.5, Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, Califor-
nia, USA).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Ecological restoration and nitrogen transformations
Our results show that ecological restoration greatly
altered soil characteristics and N transformation rates
in this ponderosa pine–bunchgrass ecosystem. Post-
treatment soil characteristics are summarized in Table
1. Important differences include increased summer soil
temperature in the restoration treatments relative to the
control, and decreased forest-ﬂoor density, total N, and
organic-matter content in the complete restoration
treatment relative to the partial restoration or control
treatments. Mineral soil

Several previous investigators have reported similar
changes in inorganic N pool sizes in southwestern pon-
derosa pine forests following prescribed ﬁre and thin-
ning (Klemmedson et al. 1962, Wagle and Kitchen
1972, Klemmedson 1976, Kovacic et al. 1986, Ryan
and Covington 1986, White 1986, Covington and Sack-
ett 1992).
Net N transformations were analyzed on an annual
basis because there was a signiﬁcant interaction be-
tween treatment, canopy type, and incubation season.
Rates were greatest in the partial restoration treatment
in the summer and greatest in the complete restoration
treatment in the winter (data not shown). In the forest
ﬂoor, annual net N transformation rates were generally
similar among treatments on an areal basis (Fig. 1),
but greater in the two restoration treatments on a mass
basis (Fig. 2). Mass-based forest ﬂoor annual net ni-

restoration, and control, respectively. Thus, while for-
est ﬂoor N and C reserves were greatly reduced in the
complete restoration treatment (Table 1), a greater per-
centage of the total N was transformed, and net N trans-
formation rates remained high. These results suggest
that substrate availability or the microclimate was more
favorable in the complete restoration forest ﬂoor than
in other treatments. We did not ﬁnd differences in forest
ﬂoor substrate quality (i.e., C:N) among treatments
(Table 1); however, mineral soil temperatures (Table 1)
suggest that forest ﬂoor temperatures (not measured)
were likely higher in the complete restoration treatment
than other treatments.
In the mineral soil and total surface soil (forest ﬂoor
1 mineral soil), the restoration treatments had three to
ﬁve times greater annual net nitriﬁcation rates and two
to three times greater annual net N mineralization than
the control (Fig. 2; P , 0.10). Net nitriﬁcation ac-
counted for 41, 86, and 78% of total surface soil net
N mineralization in the control, partial restoration, and
complete restoration treatments, respectively. Other in-
vestigators have reported elevated net N transformation
rates following a single prescribed ﬁre (Schoch and
Binkley 1986, White 1986, Knoepp and Swank 1995).
However, in soil beneath Oregon ponderosa pine, Mon-
leon et al. (1997) found no increase in ﬁeld net N
transformations following prescribed ﬁre. In addition,
the net N mineralization rates of Monleon et al. (1997)
were lower than our rates, and only a small fraction of
the N mineralized was nitriﬁed. The authors attributed
the low rates to low site fertility. Accelerated net N
transformation rates, and increases in the proportion of
net N mineralization from net nitriﬁcation following
temperate forest harvesting, are also frequently re-
ported (Vitousek and Matson 1985, Hart and Firestone
1989, Frazer et al. 1990), and comparable to those ob-
served in our partial restoration treatment.
Differences in net N transformations are caused by

1-d measurements; further testing of ﬁre and harvesting
effects on gross N transformations must include several
measurements within and among years. Our gross N
transformation rates are similar to those found in sev-
eral other temperate coniferous forests (Hart et al.
1994, Stark and Hart 1997). However, gross nitriﬁca-
tion rates at our site were higher than those reported
for infertile, granitic New Mexico ponderosa pine soils
(Stark and Hart 1997). This discrepancy is likely due

Annual net N transformation rates in the forest

Because there were no treatment 3 canopy type interactions,
means are for all treatments pooled together. The ‘‘postset-

to the optimal climate under which we conducted our
experiment or inherent differences in site fertility.
Gross microbial N transformations, which determine
net N cycling rates and plant-available N, are driven
in part by microclimate and substrate quantity and qual-
ity. Mineral soil substrate quality (i.e., C:N) and soil
moisture were similar among treatments at our site,
while soil temperature was elevated in the restoration
treatments relative to the control (Table 1). Thus, tem-
perature is likely the primary mechanism controlling
the increased gross and net N transformation rates fol-
lowing our restoration treatments.
Because we rarely observed statistical differences
between N transformations in the partial and complete
restoration treatments (Figs. 1, 2, and 3), removal of
postsettlement trees, rather than forest ﬂoor manipu-
lation and burning, was likely the main factor inﬂu-
encing N transformation rates at this site. While short-
term alteration of N transformations is probably due to
thinning alone, future restoration management will use
chronic prescribed ﬁre to maintain stand densities
achieved by the initial thinning. Consequently, our
treatments may diverge with time, as successive inter-
val burns act on the complete restoration treatment.
Chronic ﬁre may not alter soil N (Richter et al. 1982)
or may decrease N availability (Bell and Binkley 1989,
Binkley et al. 1992, Carriera et al. 1994). In a ponderosa
pine–bunchgrass ecosystem near our study site, pre-
scribed ﬁre (without preburn thinning or forest ﬂoor
manipulation) produced short-term increases in N
availability (Covington and Sackett 1986, 1992), but
after 20 yr of burning (2-yr intervals), controls had
higher N availability than burned plots (Wright and
Hart 1997). Long-term research is needed to determine
whether N transformation rates at the Gus Pearson Nat-
ural Area remain elevated through several ﬁre intervals
fueled by grass rather than pine litter.
Canopy type and nitrogen transformations
Before
Euro-American
settlement,
ﬁres
burned
through southwestern ponderosa pine forests every 2–
12 yr (Swetnam and Baisan 1996), and pines rarely
regenerated in grassy openings (White 1985, Savage
et al. 1996). Consequently, presettlement canopy cover
at our site was ;81% grassy openings and ;19% pines
(Covington et al. 1997). Fire has been excluded in
northern Arizona for ;120 yr, and most grassy open-
ings have been replaced by dense thickets of small,
postsettlement pines (Moir and Dieterich 1988, Cov-
ington and Moore 1994, Covington et al. 1994). It has
long been hypothesized that postsettlement pine in-
vasion slowed decomposition and nutrient cycling rates
(Weaver 1951, Cooper 1960, Covington and Sackett
1984). We assessed effects of pine invasion on soil N
transformations by comparing rates beneath grass and
pine canopy types. Because the relict grassy openings
at our site were brieﬂy grazed (1876–1910) and are
smaller than presettlement grassy openings, they are
not perfect analogues for the presettlement bunchgrass
community. In addition, changes in climate, atmo-
spheric chemistry, and ﬁre regimes could cause con-
temporary grassy openings to differ from presettlement
grassy openings. In order to infer effects of pine in-
vasion on N transformation rates, we assume that dif-
ferences between the contemporary and presettlement
grassy openings are small relative to differences be-
tween the pine and grassy opening canopy types.
Annual net N mineralization and net nitriﬁcation
rates in the forest ﬂoor did not differ among canopy
types (Fig. 4). However, in the mineral soil and total
surface soil, the grass canopy type had ;2 3 the annual
net N mineralization rates as the postsettlement re-
tained canopy type. These results suggest that: (1) pre-
settlement forests, having a greater grass component
than contemporary forests, likely had higher ecosys-
tem-level N cycling rates, and (2) if pines continue to
invade relict grassy openings, ecosystem-level N cy-

cling may decrease. It is unclear whether the postset-
tlement pine thickets will ever self-thin to resemble the
presettlement pine clusters at our site (Moir and Die-
terich 1988). If this does occur, our results suggest that
net nitriﬁcation rates will remain depressed, while net
N mineralization rates will increase to levels similar
to the grass canopy type (Fig. 4). A shift from
to

The mechanisms causing decreased net N transfor-
mation rates below the postsettlement retained canopy
type are unclear. We did not detect differences in min-
eral soil water content, temperature, or substrate quality
among canopy types (data not shown). However, our
measures of substrate quality were crude. Grass litter
typically has lower lignin and higher N content than
coniferous litter (Hart et al. 1993). Hunt et al. (1988)
showed that grass litter decomposed more rapidly than
lodgepole pine litter and that soil net N mineralization
rates were faster in shortgrass prairie than in lodgepole
pine forest. It is possible that a measure of lignin:N
ratio (Van Cleve et al. 1993) would indicate differences
in substrate quality that we did not detect using our
estimates of OM and total N content.
CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that partial or complete ecolog-
ical restoration increases net N transformation rates in
this southwestern ponderosa pine-bunchgrass ecosys-
tem. If the grassy openings at our site have N trans-
formation rates similar to presettlement grassy open-
ings, then restoration brought the Gus Pearson Natural
Area closer to presettlement conditions. Increased net
N transformation rates were probably due to increased
gross N mineralization and decreased gross
im-
2

mobilization. Because our complete and partial resto-
ration treatments yielded similar N transformation
rates, it may not be necessary to implement complete
restoration to increase N availability. However, other
factors, such as fuel loading, maintenance of stand
structure, and herbaceous biodiversity should be con-
sidered before prescribed ﬁre is discounted as a man-
agement tool. If ﬁre suppression persists without res-
toration efforts, the anticipated replacement of grassy
openings by pine thickets will greatly reduce N trans-
formation rates in ponderosa pine-bunchgrass ecosys-
tems. This experiment was not replicated at the site
level. Future research should assess whether the pat-
terns found at the Gus Pearson Natural Area apply to
other southwestern ponderosa pine–bunchgrass eco-
systems. In addition, this research documents short-
term (1 yr) results that may not reﬂect long-term re-
sponses to the treatments. We continue to monitor
changes in N transformations at this site to assess these
longer-term trends.
