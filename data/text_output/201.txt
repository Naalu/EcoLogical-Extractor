Changes in the vegetative structure and diversity of ponderosa pine forests have generated interest in
conducting ecological restoration projects to improve the overall forest health of these ecosystems. Eco-
logical restoration prescriptions often consist of thinning trees to emulate pre-1870s forest structure fol-
lowed by prescribed burning. Disturbances associated with ecological restoration can, however, promote
invasion by nonnative species. We compared two northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests treated for
ecological restoration, one at the Fort Valley Experimental Forest and one at Mt. Trumbull on the Grand
Canyon-Parashant National Monument. We examined the response of native and nonnative plant species,
as well as all species combined, to treatments at the two forests. Both study sites showed a signiﬁcant
increase in native and nonnative species cover and richness by the ﬁfth year post-treatment that
remained signiﬁcant by the tenth year post-treatment. Despite these general trends in native and nonna-
tive community development, the understory vegetation at the two sites followed diverging successional
patterns after treatment. By the tenth year post-treatment Fort Valley was dominated by native species
and Mt. Trumbull was dominated by a single nonnative species, cheatgrass. The differences in post-treat-
ment understory recovery are likely due to pretreatment forest conditions. At Fort Valley, nonnatives
were present, but accounted for only 0.11% of the pretreatment cover. At Mt. Trumbull, nonnatives
accounted for 5.26% of the pretreatment understory cover, with cheatgrass accounting for approximately
4% of the understory cover. Additionally, the soil seedbank at Fort Valley had greater overall species rich-
ness and greater native perennial grass richness than Mt. Trumbull. We propose that the application of
ecological restoration treatments should be targeted to sites with low abundance of nonnatives prior
to treatment. Sites containing high abundance of nonnatives prior to treatment should be managed for
nonnative species mitigation before initiating any ecological restoration projects.

1. Introduction
A century ago, the plant community of southwestern ponderosa
pine forests consisted of fewer trees and greater understory diver-
sity (Weaver, 1951; Cooper, 1960; Covington and Moore, 1994;
Bakker and Moore, 2007; Laughlin et al., 2011). With the advent
of Euro-American settlement in the region, ﬁre suppression, exten-
sive livestock grazing, and commercial logging practices altered
the successional trajectory in favor of more trees and reduced
understory. Contemporary southwestern ponderosa pine forests
often contain dense, interconnected canopies with thick forest
ﬂoor litter and duff layers. The commensurate shading and lack
of bare mineral soil for seed germination has resulted in forests
generally depauperate of understory vegetation (Covington and
Moore, 1994; Laughlin et al., 2011). The disjunction between cur-
rent and historical conditions in southwestern ponderosa pine for-
ests
has
generated
interest
in
using
ecological
restoration
techniques to improve overall forest health and increase biodiver-
sity (Covington et al., 1997; Moore et al., 1999). A common ecolog-
ical restoration prescription in southwestern ponderosa pine
forests is to thin trees to emulate historical forest structure from
a time period pre-dating the disruption of the past disturbance re-
gime, then reintroduce ﬁre to the system (Covington and Moore,
1994; Moore et al., 1999).
Ecological restoration treatments consisting of tree removal and
prescribed ﬁre intentionally generate ecological disturbances. Tree
thinning perturbs the soil and increases light inﬁltration to the
understory, while prescribed ﬁre removes much of the understory
aboveground biomass, alters short-term nutrient cycling, and

consumes accumulated litter and duff layers from the forest ﬂoor
(Covington et al., 1997; DeLuca and Zouhar, 2000; Johnson and
Curtis, 2001; Selmants et al., 2008). The ecosystem changes gener-
ated
by
restoration-induced
disturbances
promote
increased
growth and diversity in the native vegetative community (Moore
et al., 2006). Disturbances associated with ecological restoration
treatments can, however, have the unintended consequence of
exposing the ecosystem to greater risk of invasion by undesired
and detrimental nonnatives (Hobbs and Huenneke, 1992; Crawford
et al., 2001; Grifﬁs et al., 2001; Allen et al., 2002). While the pres-
ence of nonnatives is contrary to the objectives of ecological resto-
ration (SER, 2004), an elevated presence of nonnatives in response
to thinning and burning treatments is common (Wienk et al., 2004;
Dodson and Fiedler, 2006; Moore et al., 2006; Nelson et al., 2008;
Sabo et al., 2009). The risk of nonnative invasion has raised con-
cerns regarding the utility of historical reference conditions as a
standard protocol for designing ecological restoration treatments
(Allen et al., 2002; D’Antonio and Meyerson, 2002; Noss et al.,
2006; Hobbs et al., 2009; Jackson and Hobbs, 2009).
In this study we examined ecological restoration treatments in
two ponderosa pine forests in northern Arizona, USA. The ﬁrst
study site is in the Uinkaret Mountains north of the Grand Canyon
and the second is near the city of Flagstaff. Ecological restoration
treatments were based on historical reconstruction of the over-
story density and distribution combined with the application of
prescribed ﬁre. For both studies we have at least 10 years of
post-treatment data collected with the same experimental design
and methodology. We hypothesize that (1) the native understory
will increase in cover and species richness in response to ecological
restoration, (2) nonnatives will also increase in response to ecolog-
ical restoration, and (3) the understory response to ecological res-
toration will be consistent in both study sites.
2. Methods
2.1. Study sites
The Fort Valley site is located in and adjacent to the Fort Valley
Experimental Forest, approximately 15 km northwest of Flagstaff,
AZ in the Coconino National Forest (351601900N, 1114102200W).
Elevation of the study area is approximately 2250 m. Mean annual
precipitation during the duration of the sampling period (1997–
2011) was 45 cm (Western Regional Climate Center, http://
www.wrcc.dri.edu). Soils consist of ﬁne, smectitic, frigid Mollisols
and Alﬁsols derived from basaltic parent materials (Stoddard
et al., 2011). Vegetation at this site is dominated by ponderosa
pine, consisting of groups of mature trees intermixed with numer-
ous dense thickets of smaller diameter trees. Prior to treatment, to-
tal trees per hectare averaged approximately 1188 and 901,
respectively, in the control and treated units. In 1999, after both
thinning and burning, tree density decreased by 0.1% and 84%,
respectively, in the control and treated units (Korb et al., 2007).
The site has not been actively grazed by cattle since the establish-
ment of the Fort Valley Experimental Forest in 1909. The treated
units were not seeded after burning except for a portion of each
slash pile that was used in a slash pile amelioration study (Korb
et al., 2004).
The Mt. Trumbull site is in the Grand Canyon-Parashant Na-
tional Monument (GCPNM), located in the Uinkaret Mountains
(36220N, 11370W). GCPNM is co-managed by the Bureau of Land
Management and National Park Service. Elevation of the study area
is approximately 2150 m. Mean annual precipitation during the
duration of the sampling period (1997–2010) was 36 cm (Western
Regional Climate Center, http://www.wrcc.dri.edu). Soils consist of
shallow, cindery Inceptisols derived from basaltic parent materials
(McGlone et al., 2009b). Vegetation at this site is dominated by
ponderosa pine and Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii). Prior to treat-
ments, total trees per hectare averaged approximately 1372 and
1375 respectively in the control and treated units. In 2000, after
both thinning and burning, tree density decreased by 7% and 75%
in the control and treated units (Fulé et al., 2007). The site is grazed
from July 1 to October 31 by a maximum of 88 head for a total of
approximately 300 AUMs for an average of 0.18 AUMs ha1. Cattle
were excluded from the site between 1998 and 2002. The treated
units were not seeded after burning.
2.2. Experimental design and treatments
The same experimental design was implemented at both Fort
Valley and Mt. Trumbull. Treated units received a historical evi-
dence-based ecological restoration treatment that included both
thinning and prescribed ﬁre. Tree thinning was based on site-spe-
ciﬁc reconstructions of pre-1870s forest structure using principles
described by Moore et al. (1999). For each site, evidence of old-
growth individuals (trees established prior to Euro-American set-
tlement of the region in 1870) was used as a basis for live tree
retention. In addition to retaining all old-growth trees, 1.5–3 addi-
tional trees were retained as replacement per old-growth individ-
ual evidence (e.g. logs, snags, and stumps from trees established
prior to the 1870s). This procedure was designed to leave 150–
300% of the trees per hectare we estimated existing in our pre-
1870s forest structure reconstruction. The retention of more trees
per hectare than levels determined by forest reconstruction offset
potential errors in reconstructions and unpredicted mortality after
treatment. The number of younger replacement trees depended on
tree size. If the replacement trees were <40.6 cm diameter at breast
height, the higher retention rate was used. In addition, trees in
close proximity to each piece of evidence were preferentially re-
tained to more closely approximate the pre-1870s spatial pattern.
Prescribed ﬁre was applied by drip torch using strip head ﬁres.
Additionally, each treated unit was paired with a control unit that
was neither thinned nor burned.
Fort Valley contains three replicated experimental blocks and
Mt. Trumbull contains four experimental blocks. Each experimen-
tal block contained two treatment units that were randomly as-
signed as either a treated or a control unit. Treatment units
ranged in size from 14 to 16 ha, and each contained twenty
400 m2 (11.28 m radius) ﬁxed area monitoring plots established
on a 60 m  60 m grid. Plot centers were permanently marked
with iron stakes to ensure exact relocation for sampling in subse-
quent years. Sampling protocol for herbaceous vegetation was
modiﬁed from the National Park Service ﬁre monitoring protocol
(USDI NPS, 1992). Each plot included one 50 m point-line intercept
transect oriented parallel to the prevailing slope and centered on
plot center. Sampling points were located every 30 cm along each
transect for a total of 166 points per plot. Species information was
recorded any time a portion of a plant’s live aboveground biomass
intersected a sampling point. Species presence/absence was also
record within a 10 m  50 m (500 m2) belt transect centered on
the point-line intercept transect. Taxonomic nomenclature and
species nativity follow the USDA Plants Database (USDA NRCS,
2012).
Tree thinning was conducted in 1999 at both sites except for
one experimental block at Mt. Trumbull that was thinned in
1998. All blocks at both sites were initially burned in spring
2001 except for one experimental block at Fort Valley that was
burned in spring 2000. All blocks at both sites were reburned in fall
2007. All pretreatment data were collected in 1998. We collected
data in the ﬁrst growing season post-treatment in summer 2001
at both sites except for the experimental block at Fort Valley that
was burned in spring 2000 where we collected data in summer

2000. The 2000 data were combined with 2001 data for analysis.
Fort Valley was subsequently resampled in 2006 and 2011. Mt.
Trumbull was subsequently resampled in 2005 and 2010.
2.3. Data analysis
We used the point-line intercept data to estimate aerial cover
by summing the number of points per line intercepting a given live
plant species and dividing by the total number of possible points.
We calculated cover for each species individually and total cover
of all points with recorded plants, regardless of species. We used
the belt transects to calculate species richness. The number of all
(total), nonnative, and native species recorded on the belt transect
was summed per plot. The plot totals were then averaged within
treatment unit in each block to determine average total, nonnative,
and native species richness per treatment per block. In 2003, cheat-
grass (Bromus tectorum) heavily invaded Mt. Trumbull following a
severe drought in 2002 (McGlone et al., 2009a). To determine the
inﬂuence of cheatgrass on the understory response to treatment
we examined all the data from both sites with and without
cheatgrass.
Our two study sites were sampled in different years using dif-
ferent ﬁeld crews. To account for interannual climatic variability
and ﬁeld estimate variability among observers, we have conducted
all analyses using standardized data. We tested for trends in total,
native, and nonnative aerial cover and species richness for each site
using Cohen’s d (also known as Hedges’s g) effect size analysis
(Hedges, 1981; Cohen, 1988). Effect size analysis was developed
to allow for comparison of data from multiple sites (Gurevitch
and Hedges, 1999). For each test variable we calculated a d statistic
using the following equation:
d ¼ m2  m1
spooled
;
where the pooled standard deviation is:

size for each treated unit, s2
1 is the variance for a control unit, and s2
2
is the variance for a treated unit (Hedges, 1981; Cohen, 1988). We
calculated a mean d statistic for each test variable among the blocks
for each study site and determined a 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) for
each mean d statistic (Nakagawa and Cuthill, 2007). We generated
means and measures of variability using JMP software (version
8.0; SAS Institute, Inc., 2008). We calculated the d statistics
manually.
We also tested for differences in relative nonnative cover and
species richness. We calculated relative nonnative cover and rich-
ness by dividing the nonnative cover or richness per plot by the to-
tal cover or richness per plot, times 100. We used ANOVA to test for
differences between sites for the main effects of site, treatment,
and year as well as all possible interactions. We also tested for dif-
ferences within site for the main effects of treatment and year as
well as the treatment by year interaction. To test for differences

within signiﬁcant year or treatment by year interaction results, we
used Tukey’s HSD post hoc analysis. We tested for the assumptions
of normality and homogeneity of the data through visual assess-
ment of histograms. The richness data, both with and without
cheatgrass, met the assumptions of normality and homogeneity.

mality of distribution. All ANOVA analyses were conducted using
JMP software (version 8.0; SAS Institute, Inc., 2008).
3. Results
3.1. Understory trends in response to treatment
Cohen’s d trend analysis showed both sites, total, nonnative,
and native cover and richness had a signiﬁcantly greater response
to treatment as compared to the controls (Figs. 1 and 2). The Fort
Valley study site showed a signiﬁcant positive response for all vari-
ables by 2006 that continued to be signiﬁcant by 2011 (Fig. 1). Na-
tive cover had a greater positive response to treatment than
nonnative cover. Native and nonnative richness had a similar mag-
nitude of response. Removal of cheatgrass from the analysis had no
signiﬁcant effect on the results for any variable (Fig. 1B and D).
The Mt. Trumbull study site had a more varied response to
treatment, but most variables showed a signiﬁcant positive re-
sponse to treatment by 2005 that was maintained into 2010
(Fig. 2). Both nonnative cover and richness showed a stronger re-
sponse to treatment than native cover and richness. The removal
of cheatgrass from the analysis reduced the effect size of treatment
response for total and nonnative cover as well as total and nonna-
tive richness (Fig. 2B and D). By 2010, the total cover treatment re-
sponse was no longer signiﬁcant when cheatgrass was excluded
from analysis (Fig. 2B). This implies that the signiﬁcant positive re-
sponse of total cover of all species in 2010 was primarily driven by
greater cheatgrass cover.
3.2. Relative nonnative contribution to understory
When we compared ANOVA results from the two study sites,
relative nonnative cover was signiﬁcant for site and treatment
regardless of whether cheatgrass was included or excluded from
the analysis (Table 1). Mt. Trumbull had greater relative nonnative
cover than Fort Valley regardless of treatment and the treated units
had greater relative nonnative cover than the controls regardless of
site (Fig. 3A). These results were consistent whether cheatgrass
was included in the analysis or not. Neither year nor any interac-
tion had a signiﬁcant ANOVA result. Relative nonnative species
richness had a signiﬁcant between site response to treatment
regardless of whether cheatgrass was included or excluded from
the analysis (Table 1). The treated units had greater relative nonna-
tive species richness regardless of site (Fig. 3B–D). Neither year nor
site nor any interaction had a signiﬁcant ANOVA result.
At Fort Valley, relative nonnative cover was not signiﬁcant
regardless of whether cheatgrass was included in the analysis
(Table 1; Fig. 3A). Prior to treatment, Dalmatian toadﬂax (Linaria
dalmatica) and common mullein (Verbascum thapsus) had an

cheatgrass (C) and excluding cheatgrass (D). Error bars show 95% CI. If symbol is above the zero line, magnitude of response was greater in treated units than in untreated
controls. If symbol is below the zero line, then the reverse is true. If error bars do not equal or cross zero line, difference is signiﬁcant. Letters above symbols indicate
signiﬁcant results for total (a), nonnative (b), and native (c) species. Arrows indicate application of restoration treatments.

average total cover of <0.01% in the control and treated units. By
2011, Dalmatian toadﬂax and common mullein were ubiquitous
in the treated units at Fort Valley (Table 2). Nonnative speices cov-
er remained low, however, with Dalmatian toadﬂax having the
greatest average cover (0.23% in treated units) of any nonnative
species. Relative nonnative richness was signiﬁcant for treatment
and year, as well as the treatment by year interaction, regardless
of whether cheatgrass was included in the analysis (Table 1;
Fig. 3B and C). In 2011, the treated units had signiﬁcantly greater
relative nonnative richness (8.578%; SE = 0.778) than the control
units in any year (e.g. 2011 control relative nonnative rich-
ness = 3.198%; SE = 0.778). Prior to treatment, only six nonnative
species were detected at Fort Valley and only two, Dalmatian toad-
ﬂax and common mullein, are listed as noxious in at least one state
(Table 2). By 2011, 12 nonnative species were detected and four
additional species listed as noxious in at least one state were de-
tected: cheatgrass, musk thistle (Carduus nutans), bull thistle (Cir-
sium vulgare), and ﬁeld bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis).
At Mt. Trumbull, relative nonnative cover was signiﬁcantly
greater in the treated units when cheatgrass was included in the
analysis,
but
not
when
cheatgrass
was
excluded
(Table
1;
Fig. 3A). By 2010, cheatgrass had greater average cover in the trea-
ted units (5.05%) than any other non-tree species, with bottlebrush
squirreltail (Elymus elymoides) having the next greatest average
cover (2.58%). Surprisingly, considering the large contribution of
cheatgrass to the understory cover at Mt. Trumbull, there was no
signiﬁcant site  year  treatment interaction, even when cheat-
grass was included in the analysis (F = 0.12; p = 0.88). This is possi-
bly an artifact of the high variability of the data and low
replication. Common mullein was also ubiquitous in the treated
units by 2010 (Table 2), but the average cover was low (<0.01%).
Relative nonnative richness was signiﬁcant for treatment and year
when cheatgrass was included in the analysis, but was only signif-
icant for treatment when cheatgrass was excluded (Table 1; Fig. 3B
and D). As with relative nonnative cover, none of the interactions
were signiﬁcant. Prior to treatment, the Mt. Trumbull study sites
contained 10 nonnative species of which three (cheatgrass, ﬁeld
bindweed, and common mullein) are listed as noxious weeds in
at least one state (Table 2). By 2010, we detected 14 nonnative spe-
cies including two additional species listed as noxious weeds in at
least one state: crossﬂower (Chorispora tenella) and Scotch cotton-
thistle (Onopordum acanthium).
4. Discussion
Restoration in both forests reliably increased understory cover
and richness, but the response was highly varied between the
two sites. The increased native and nonnative cover and richness
were typically detectable after 5 years and the overall trends re-
mained consistent after 10 years. After 10 years, however, Fort Val-
ley was dominated by native species, while Mt. Trumbull was
dominated by a single nonnative species: cheatgrass. These results
support our ﬁrst and second hypotheses: (1) native understory will
increase in cover and species richness in response to the ecological
restoration and (2) nonnatives will also increase in response to
treatments. The magnitude of nonnative increase was greater at
Mt. Trumbull for both cover and richness than at Fort Valley. Due
to the difference in the response of nonnative species to treatments
and the lack of a signiﬁcant increase in total cover at Mt. Trumbull
when cheatgrass was removed from the analysis, we reject our
third hypothesis that the understory response to ecological resto-
ration will be consistent in both study sites.
Disturbances, such as those associated with ﬁre, tree removal,
and/or grazing have often been linked to nonnative encroachment
(D’Antonio and Vitousek, 1992; Hobbs and Huenneke, 1992;
Brooks et al., 2004). The degree of post-disturbance invasion varies
from strong, with nonnatives constituting a substantial component
of the understory (e.g. – Wienk et al., 2004; Floyd et al., 2006;
Dodge et al., 2008), to mild, with nonnatives only detected in trace
amounts (e.g. – Laughlin et al., 2004; Kuenzi et al., 2008; Fornwalt
et al., 2010). The intensity of nonnative invasion is often correlated
with severity of disturbance (e.g. – Wienk et al., 2004; Dodge et al.,
2008), but this relationship is not reliable. For example, Kuenzi
et al. (2008) reported low levels of invasion after a wildﬁre in Ari-
zona, even in severely burned areas. After the Hayman Fire in Col-
orado, Fornwalt et al. (2010) reported nonnative encroachment
increased with increasing ﬁre severity, but nonnative cover and
richness remained low. Conversely, given proper climatic condi-
tions substantial invasions have been documented even with only
minor disturbances (Evans et al., 2001; Belnap and Phillips, 2001).
Considering the similarities in treatment prescription and
implementation, the disparate responses of the two sites to resto-
ration treatments highlights the potential for variability in post-
disturbance successional trajectories. Both Fort Valley and Mt.
Trumbull had areas of severe disturbance, but the response to
treatment was different. At Fort Valley, disturbances associated
with mechanical tree harvesting and slash pile burning resulted
in increased nonnatives in the understory and seed bank, but the

increases were typically isolated to the vicinity of slash piles (Korb
et al., 2004). In the ﬁrst two years after treatment, Mt. Trumbull
experienced limited increases in the nonnative component of the
understory (Fig. 3; McGlone et al., 2009a,b). By 2010, however,
nonnative cover and richness had increased signiﬁcantly through-
out the treated units and often dominated the landscape (Fig. 2).
The fact that Mt. Trumbull was heavily invaded by nonnative
while Fort Valley was not is likely the result of conditions at the
time of restoration treatment implementation. Prior to treatment,
Fort Valley contained a nonnative component to the plant commu-
nity, including the noxious weed Dalmatian toadﬂax. Dalmatian
toadﬂax is a species that responds positively to ﬁre and has been
perceived as a transformer species (sensu Richardson et al., 2000)
in other ecosystems (D’Antonio et al., 2004; Dodge et al., 2008).
Pretreatment cover of Dalmatian toadﬂax was low. After treat-
ment, Dalmatian toadﬂax increased, but remained a minor compo-
nent of the understory at Fort Valley (Stoddard et al., 2011). Mt.
Trumbull, like Fort Valley, contained a nonnative component to
the plant community prior to treatment including cheatgrass, a
species that responds positively to ﬁre and is considered a trans-
former species (D’Antonio and Vitousek, 1992; Brooks et al.,
2004; D’Antonio et al., 2004). Unlike Dalmatian toadﬂax at Fort
Valley, cheatgrass was prevalant at Mt. Trumbull prior to treat-
ment. While cheatgrass did not expand its population detectably
in the ﬁrst years after treatment, subsequent disturbances associ-
ated with a severe drought in 2002 resulted in a greatly increased
cheatgrass population at Mt. Trumbull (McGlone et al., 2009a) that
has remained stable (McGlone et al., 2011).
Posttreatment differences in plant community development be-
tween study sites may also be a function of differences in pretreat-
ment soil seedbanks. Baseline soil seedbank studies from both Fort
Valley and Mt. Trumbull prior to ecological restoration treatments
indicate that common mullein was the most common species in
the study area (Fort Valley: 566; Mt. Trumbull: 940 seeds/m2; Korb
et al., 2005). Fort Valley had slightly higher total species richness in
the soil seed bank (Fort Valley: 24 species; Mt. Trumbull: 19 spe-
cies). The two sites differed substantially, however, in the higher
number of native perennial graminoid species detected in the soil
seed bank at Fort Valley (6 species) when compared to Mt. Trum-
bull (1 species), with bottlebrush squirreltail the only native peren-
nial grass species detected in the soil seed bank at Mt. Trumbull.
Seed banks at both sites contained potential transformer species.
Dalmatian toadﬂax seeds were present in the soil at Fort Valley
prior to treatment, but were not among the most abundant species
(Korb et al., 2005). At Mt. Trumbull, however, the soil seed bank in
stands dominated by New Mexico locust (Robinia neomexicana)
and big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) contained approximately
193 cheatgrass seeds/m2 (Springer, 1999). Preﬁre cheatgrass seed-
bank, as a function of preﬁre cheatgrass cover, is considered the
strongest determinant of postﬁre cheatgrass dominance in ponder-
osa pine forests (Keeley and McGinnis, 2007).
While the actual contribution of cattle grazing to the cheatgrass
invasion on Mt. Trumbull is unknown, the differences in grazing
history between Fort Valley and Mt. Trumbull cannot be ignored.
Fort Valley has not been actively grazed by cattle for over a cen-
tury, while Mt. Trumbull has had active grazing for most of that

time period. Cattle were reintroduced to Mt. Trumbull after a 3-
year exclusion in August 2002, approximately coincident with ger-
mination of the cheatgrass plants detected in the 2003 invasion.
Cattle grazing may have facilitated the introduction and dispersal
cheatgrass seeds thus contributing to the establishment of the
cheatgrass seed bank. The winter and spring pastures for the Mt.
Trumbull cattle herd are heavily invaded by cheatgrass (Whit Bun-
ting, BLM Rangeland Management Specialist, Personal Communi-
cation).
Past
research
has
shown
that
cattle
grazing
has
facilitated the persistence of cheatgrass, particularly in dry years
(Sorensen and McGlone, 2010).
Lastly, differences in restoration success may be a function of
intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of the two sites. The likeli-
hood of successful establishment and persistence of nonnative
plant species, particularly cheatgrass, is greatly reduced at wetter
high elevation sites than at drier, low elevation sites (Pierson and
Mack, 1990; Keeley et al., 2003). The Fort Valley site is both higher
in elevation and receives greater annual precipitation than Mt.
Trumbull. Furthermore, the extent of an ecosystem’s historical
range is considered a factor in determining the site potential for
successful restoration (Palik et al., 2000). The Mt. Trumbull site is
an isolated sky island mountain system with ponderosa pine for-
ests occurring at only the highest elevations. Fort Valley is within
the largest contiguous ponderosa pine forest in North America.
5. Conclusions
There are numerous parameters to consider when assessing the
success of an ecological restoration project. The Society for Ecolog-
ical Restoration (SER, 2004) deﬁnes a restored ecosystem as con-
taining ‘‘a characteristic assemblage of the species that occur in
the reference ecosystem and that provide appropriate community
structure,’’ consisting ‘‘of indigenous species to the greatest practi-
cable extent,’’ and being ‘‘sufﬁciently resilient to endure the nor-
mal periodic stress events in the local environment that serve to
maintain the integrity of the ecosystem.’’ Targets for restoring
southwestern ponderosa pine forests frequently include reduction
of the potential for sustained crown ﬁres and promotion of a robust
native understory community (Fulé et al., 1997; Moore et al., 1999;
Laughlin et al., 2006). The Fort Valley study site was successful at
achieving both of these goals; tree canopy cover has been reduced
(Korb et al., 2007) and native understory cover and richness has
been increased. At Mt. Trumbull the risk of sustained crown ﬁre
has been reduced (Roccaforte et al., 2010) and the native under-
story has greater richness than the untreated control units and pre-
treatment conditions. The Mt. Trumbull restoration project is
compromised, however, by the persistent dominance of cheatgrass
and the lack of sustained increases in native understory cover.
While several nonnative species are capable of invading areas dis-
turbed by ﬁre and/or tree removal, cheatgrass is a recurring threat
to higher elevation areas of the Southwest (Keeley et al., 2003;
Floyd et al., 2006; Owen et al., 2011; McGlone et al., 2011). Consid-
ering the severe ecological impacts of cheatgrass invasions in areas
such as the Great Basin, it is difﬁcult to perceive any restoration
project that has been invaded by cheatgrass as successful.
Our study demonstrates the potential for highly varied out-
comes of ecological restoration projects using a similar approach
to establish reference conditions. The success at Fort Valley and
lack of success at Mt. Trumbull emphasizes the need for adaptive
management by practitioners, particularly in regards to site selec-
tion and modiﬁcation of restoration treatments to include nonna-
tive mitigation. We recommend that managers prioritize areas
for restoration treatments that contain a very low nonnative spe-
cies presence. Managers should particularly avoid areas that con-
tain established populations of transformer species that are
known or suspected to be aggressive invaders in the region or in
similar ecosystems, (e.g. cheatgrass, star-thistle (Centaurea sp.),
medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae), etc.).
Ecosystems that contain established populations of aggressive
nonnatives may be of management priority for restoration and
we do not propose that such sites be excluded from restoration
management. We do, however, recommend nonnative mitigation
activities prior to restoration treatment in order to minimize risk
of a vegetation community shift to nonnative dominance. Improve-
ments in herbicide and biocontrol technologies are expanding
management options for nonnative mitigation. In general,
however, implementation of a single mitigation treatment is
insufﬁcient for sustained nonnative species control (e.g. Reever

Morghan and Seastedt, 1999; Owen et al., 2011). Areas of high
management priority with high risk of invasion (e.g. wildland–ur-
ban interfaces) may require a multi-staged approach to restoration
with assessment and nonnative mitigation occurring before, dur-
ing, and after treatment implementation. Unfortunately, little is
known about pretreatment threshold levels of nonnative popula-
tions that put an ecosystem at risk of severe invasion. Additionally,
advances in herbicide and biocontrol technology may alter pre-
treatment threshold levels in the future. Our study highlights that
few nonnatives are truly aggressive invaders. Of the 24 nonnative
species detected on the two sites combined, 13 were present prior
to treatment, but only one species, cheatgrass, became a severe
invader.
Extensive nonnative mitigation practices are expensive and
time consuming. Additionally, management agencies will be un-
able to implement restoration projects at rates fast enough to ne-
gate the risk of catastrophic wildﬁre in all forests. We therefore
recommend that ecological restoration projects be triaged for max-
imum likelihood of success and not risk compromising the out-
come of the project in favor of maximizing the area treated.
