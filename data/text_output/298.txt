A Case Study on the Economics of Thinning in
the Wildland Urban Interface
Debra S. Larson, and Richard Mirth, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering,
Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ 86011-1560.
ABSTRACT:  This is a case study, supplemented by an economic model, of one 85 ac ponderosa pine (Pinus
ponderosa) dominated stand, called Unit 16, that was treated during the summer of 2001. Unit 16 is located
in the Greater Flagstaff Forests Partnership’s Fort Valley project area of the Coconino National Forest and
is part of the Flagstaff, AZ wildland urban interface. The silvicultural prescription was a full restoration
prescription anchored to the presettlement condition and was limited by a 16 in. dbh cutting cap. The
operational strategy for the merchantable material was hand felling, limbing, topping, bucking in the forest,
and forwarding of logs to the landing for loading on waiting trucks. The nonmerchantable trees were cut and
rough piled, along with limbs and tops. The economic model estimated the logging contractor’s costs to total
$124,117. His total revenue stream during the summer of 2001 was detrimentally impacted by two unforeseen
changes in his market. His normal purchaser of wood from small trees <8.0 in. dbh was unable to purchase this
wood and his other market reduced its purchase price by 11%. As a result, his projected income went from
providing a small profit of $7,857 to a loss of $3,284. Costs to the Forest Service to prepare the unit and to
conduct postthinning activities were estimated to total $31,9160. Net costs to the Greater Flagstaff Forests
Partnership in the form of a service contract with the logger totaled $17,000. West. J. Appl. For. 19(1):60–65.
Key Words:  Arizona, ponderosa pine, harvesting, fuels removal.
The Greater Flagstaff Forests Partnership (GFFP), formerly
known as the Grand Canyon Forests Partnership, is a joint
effort between the Coconino National Forest, the City of
Flagstaff, Northern Arizona University, and a number of other
regional organizations located in northern Arizona. This effort
is formally recognized via a cooperative agreement between
the USDA Forest Service and the GFFP for the purpose of
improving and restoring ecosystem health of ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa) forest ecosystems over 100,000 ac of
Flagstaff wildland urban interface (WUI) (GFFP 1998). The
agreement establishes the GFFP as a National Performance
Review Reinvention Laboratory and permits the cutting of
timber “in connection with land uses which are of substantial
benefit to the National Forests” without payment. The effects
of this agreement are: timber can be conveyed, at no cost, to
the GFFP from the Forest Service; the GFFP can enter into
contracts with private operators to thin Forest Service lands;
the GFFP is responsible for all funds, except contract
administration, necessary to complete thinning projects;
generated funds can only be used for on-the-ground restoration
work; and contract administration remains with the Forest
Service (GFFP 2001a).
The GFFP seeks to combine both ecosystem restoration
and forest fuels reduction goals in the WUI using ecologically
sound, economically viable, and socially acceptable practices
(GFFP 2001b). These practices include: the reduction of
excess trees by thinning; the removal of ground, ladder, and
aerial fuels; the re-introduction of low-intensity fire; the
restoration of meadows; and the obliteration of some non-
Forest Service system trails and two-track roads.
Our work with the GFFP focuses on the economics of
thinning and fuels removal. We strive to understand the
relationships between current forest conditions, on-the-ground
management decisions, the resulting primary operations, and
market influences. This article, a case study of an actual GFFP
project supplemented by an economic model, provides some
interesting insights about these relationships within the WUI
of Flagstaff, AZ. Specifically, it includes: (1) an examination
of actual thinning costs by hand felling; (2) a comparison of
these costs to the value of the harvested wood; (3) the
incorporation of costs incurred by the local Forest Service in
preparation for (e.g., NEPA) and after thinning (e.g., burning);
and (4) a prediction of how a small wood, low value market
could have changed the logger’s net return.
Unit, Stand, and Treatment
The study focuses on the treatment of one 85 ac unit, Unit
16, which was thinned in the summer of 2001. Unit 16 is part

of a 1,700 ac GFFP project called Fort Valley Ecosystem
Restoration Project—Phase I. This project is located about 5
mi northwest of Flagstaff within an area of the Coconino
National Forest that is adjacent to deeded, private, mostly
developed inholdings (Peaks 1998). The project includes a
mosaic of silvicultural prescriptions, ranging from no treatment
in wildlife areas to full restoration in areas with five or more
large, mature ponderosa pine trees/ac. All prescriptions,
however, were constrained by a cutting cap that limited
thinning to trees smaller than 16 in. in diameter measured at
breast height (dbh). This cap was in response to concerns
expressed by regional environmental organizations (SWFA
1996 and 1998, Suckling 2000). The GFFP attempted, via the
cap, to prove that its focus is forest restoration and fuels
reduction, and not commercial, large-tree, logging.
Unit 16 is one of four rectangular shaped treatment units of
the Phase I project designed to test four different silvicultural
prescriptions. Unit 16 includes a game corridor running in a
north-south direction through the eastern side of the unit.
Ground slope is approximately 6%. The existing stand and
leave tree mark on Unit 16 were inventoried during the
summer of 2000 using a systematic strip sampling technique
with a 0.89 confidence interval and a 26% error over the unit.
The existing tree count averaged 426 tpa. Average tree size
was 7.0 in. dbh.
The silviculture prescription applied to Unit 16 is called
full restoration thinning, also known as the presettlement 1.5–
3 treatment (Peaks 1998). This prescription was designed by
the staff from NAU’s Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI)
and is anchored to the presettlement condition, as presented
via evidences such as stumps, snags, downed trees, and stump
holes. See Covington and others (2001 and 1997) for additional
information about this prescription. Each evidence is replaced
by 1.5 trees whenever large (>16 in. dbh) vigorous trees are
available within a specified search radius. If the only available
replacement trees are smaller than 16 in. dbh, three trees are
marked for retention. For this project, two different search
strategies were used (H.B. Smith, Pers. Comm., Ecological
Restoration Institute, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff,
AZ, June 22, 2000). Over the eastern half of the unit, a 60 ft
search radius was used. Over the western half, the search
radius was decreased to 30 ft. Within both search areas, a
deliberate attempt was made to group the leave trees.
Figure 1 is a summary of the existing stand, cutting activity,
and residual tree projections in six size classes averaged over
the entire unit. A close examination of Figure 1 suggests that
approximately two 16 in. dbh or greater trees/ac will be cut,
regardless of the cutting cap. This is not really the case but is
indicative of an error in marking or inventory measurements.
What might be a 15.9 in. dbh tree to a marker was found to be
a 16 in. dbh tree during the inventory.
Cutting projections form the basis of the economic work
presented in this article. These projections are summarized in
Table 1 in terms of cut tree numbers and merchantable wood
volume in 100 ft3. Merchantable wood volume was estimated
using equations derived by Hann and Bare (1978) that depend
upon tree dbh, overall tree height, and inside bark diameter
(dib) at top. Tree heights were estimated from a height-
diameter curve (Larson et al. 2001) established from
unpublished tree data collected by ERI (Fulé 2000) in units
adjacent to Unit 16. Market conditions dictate top dib and, as
such, volumes were estimated using a 4 in. dib for 5 to 7.9 in.
dbh trees and a 6 in. dib for larger trees. Average size of the cut
tree was estimated to be 8.7 in. dbh.
Cost to Restore Forests and Reduce Fuels
Contract and Operational Strategy
Since this was a GFFP project established in accordance
with the cooperative agreement, the thinning contract over
Unit 16, as well as two other units, was prepared and negotiated
by the GFFP. It called for hand felling, limbing, topping, and
bucking in the forest of all trees larger than 5 in. dbh and the
forwarding of associated logs to the landing for loading onto
waiting trucks. The nonmerchantable trees (<5 in. dbh) were
cut and rough piled, along with limbs and tops. These piles
were scattered throughout the forest. Eventually, the Forest
Service will burn these piles plus conduct a broadcast burn.
The contractor paid the GFFP a $50/ac stumpage for the saw
logs harvested from the 9 to 15.9 in. dbh trees. The GFFP paid
the contractor $250/ac to complete the thinning and rough
piling work. These thinning funds were raised from private
sources by the GFFP.
Cost Model Attributes
A previously developed model (Larson et al. 2000 and
2001), refined to capture the attributes of this unit and the
operational strategy details, was used to estimate treatment
costs. This model assigns only direct costs—equipment
depreciation, opportunity costs, office overhead, and profit
are not accounted for—to reflect the current realities of
working in northern Arizona.

Northern Arizona is a region with few wood markets
that can effectively utilize logs from trees <16 in. dbh. At
the time of this project, the only available markets included:
(1) A firewood producer located approximately 75 mi
from Unit 16 desiring, at a minimum, an 8 ft log with a 4-
in.-dib small end. It generally takes a 5 or 6-in.-dbh tree to
produce this log. (2) A pallet mill located approximately
155 mi from Unit 16 desiring, at a minimum, a 12-ft-long
log with a 6-in.-dib small end. It generally takes an 8-in.-
dbh tree to produce this log. (3) A low volume viga, high
quality poles that are used in southwestern-type roof and
ceiling applications, market located approximately 135 mi
from Unit 16 desiring, at a minimum, a 12-ft-long log with
a 10-in.-dib small end. It generally takes a 14-in.-dbh tree
to produce this log. (4) A sawmill located approximately
545 mi from Unit 16 desiring, at a minimum, a 16-ft 6-in.-
long log with a 6-in.-dib small end. It generally takes a 9-
in.-dbh tree to produce this log, and (5) A large log sawmill
located approximately 155 mi from Unit 16 desiring, a 16-
ft 6-in.- long log with a 9-in.-dib small end. It generally
takes a 12-in.-dbh tree to produce this log.
These existing markets are less than suitable because
they are of low value, too far away, or unable to utilize the
wood taken from trees <9.0 in. dbh—the largest component
of thinning. As the result, the local logging contractors
stay in business because they have diversified their business
(e.g., into trucking), or they rely on fully depreciated
equipment and forego reinvestment in their logging
business.
The model assumes that harvesting costs depend upon
the processing speed of the three sawyers, with the
forwarding and loading systems in balance with sawyer
production. Assumed sawyer processing rates are given in
Table 2. These rates were developed for relatively flat
terrain and include walking time between trees and an
efficiency factor of 0.7. These rates were field confirmed
through observations made during the processing of 80
trees, ranging from 5 to 12 in. dbh. In those areas of the unit
considered rough, due to the presence of large boulders
and rock fields, processing rates were doubled to account
for the more difficult working conditions. Over the range
of merchantable trees, these assumptions yielded an average
time of 5.12 min./tree to walk, fell, delimb, top, and buck.
The same sawyers that processed the merchantable
trees also treated the precommercial stand component
consisting of trees <5 in. dbh. The theoretical time to cut
these trees was based on previous observations made of
this contractor while working in another cutting area
(Pinjuv 2000). These observations were made during the
summer of 2000 in Unit 12 of the GFFP’s Fort Valley
Research and Demonstration Project located within the
vicinity of this newer project. In addition to the observed
cutting rate of 11 trees/min., the model incorporated
additional time for walking between the clumps of small
trees, rough piling, and downtime.
The logging contractor paid his sawyers by the truckload
that on analysis yielded an equivalent basic rate of $11/hr.
The cost model included the additional employer related
expenses of workman’s and unemployment compensation,
social security and Medicare taxes, and liability insurance.
Mobilization and roadwork costs were assigned
according to ratios established in a previous project on the
Fort Valley Experimental Forest (Larson and Mirth 1999)
that had road, terrain, and stand characteristics similar to
that of Unit 16.
The cost to truck was based upon a flat rate of $60/hr
with time allocated for travel to and from market, loading,
unloading, and delays. In this case, the contractor’s
markets—pallets and vigas, as described in more detail
below—were located in the Phoenix area. Total miles per
truckload, including empty back hauls, averaged 306 mi.
The number of truckloads was calculated directly from the
stand data estimates of merchantable wood applicable to
the pallet and viga mix. These calculations yielded 1.76
loads/ac for a total of 149.6 loads. The operator’s actual
production records showed a total of 150 truckloads.
Model Results
The model estimated total contractor costs over Unit 16
as $124,117, equivalent to $1,460/ac. The relative
contributions of the major costs for the direct-cost
contractor are summarized in the pie chart of Figure 2. As
shown, trucking the logs to market accounted for 48% of
the costs, followed closely by harvesting (thinning and
removal) of the trees 5 in. dbh and greater. Treatment of
the precommercial trees accounted for only a small portion
of the total project costs, reflecting a relatively small
number, 162 tpa, of nonmerchantable trees/ac. The contract
stumpage of $50/ac accounted for 3% of the contractor’s
costs.

Other Costs
Although this project is a GFFP one, the Forest Service still
incurred related costs. Their responsibilities to the NEPA
process, as well as the need to monitor, burn piles, and conduct
broadcast burns, is the same regardless of the project’s
relationship to GFFP. No analysis of treatment costs would be
complete without the recognition of these costs, which are
reported in Table 3.
These costs were estimated using data from a 5 yr planning
document prepared by the Peaks/Morman Lake Ranger District
of the Coconino National Forest (Waldrip 2002). Unit 16 lies
within the Peaks Ranger District. Table 3 shows that the total
estimated costs incurred for this one 85 ac unit is $31,960,
equal to $376/ac. Missing from this table is the service fee that
is typical of these types of projects. In this case, the GFFP
incurred this cost of $250/ac for a total of $21,250.
Revenue from Forest Restoration and Fuel
Reduction
Although costs are important, they must be contrasted
against the revenue generated through the sale of harvested
wood to gain a more complete understanding of economics.
The influence of wood markets must be evaluated. In this
section, we provide two different revenue analyses. The first
analysis examines the actual market conditions during the
summer of 2001 and the resulting logger income and net
return on the unit. The second is a follow-on, what-if analysis
examining income and net returns due to the availability of an
additional small-wood, low-value market.
Summer of 2001: Markets, Income, and Net
Return
Typically, the contractor of Unit 16 sold his wood into
three markets. Small logs (4 in. dib, small end) were sold for
conversion into packaged bundles of split firewood. Larger
logs (6 in. dib, small end) were sold for conversion into pallets.
Logs from the limited number of available trees (14 in. dbh
and larger) were sold for conversion into high-value rough-
hewn beams and vigas.
At the time of this project, however, the firewood
manufacturer was unable to purchase logs due to a zoning
dispute restricting log storage at the manufacturer’s yard.
As a consequence, the logger was limited to only the pallet
and viga markets. The small tree component, generally
consisting of merchantable trees <8 in. dbh, could not be
brought to market and was wasted. The logger also suffered
an additional market change during the thinning of Unit
16. The pallet mill reduced its offering price from the
equivalent of $31.54/green ton to $28/green ton
approximately two-thirds of the way through the unit. The
actual pricing structure was different than this. An
equivalent price is given here to provide a degree of
confidentiality for the pallet mill and the logging contractor.
In addition to markets, the logger received $250/ac to
treat Unit 16. This was the service component of his
contract—a cost to the GFFP as noted earlier.
The previously described cost model was modified to
estimate the income received from selling the 149.6
truckloads of logs to the pallet and viga markets. This
analysis suggested that the logger received a total of
$99,583 for the wood plus an additional $21,250 for the
service component of his contract. This is equivalent to
$1,422/ac of income. Figure 3 shows the relative
contributions that each income sector made to the total
revenue estimate. Revenue from pallets dominated,
accounting for 66% of the total.
A comparison of total revenue to incurred costs reveals
a grim financial picture. This cost/revenue analysis
indicates that the logger lost a total of $3,284 or $38.63/ac.
The change in price by the pallet manufacturer was one
factor contributing to this. If the pallet manufacturer had
continued to pay $31.54/green ton throughout, the cost to
revenue results would have been better with the net return
moving from a loss to a small profit of $2,856 or $33.60/
ac. The other market-related factor that contributed to the
grim financial situation of Unit 16 was the unforeseen loss
of the firewood market.
Impacts of the Missing Firewood Market
As noted above, the existing market of pallets and
vigas, supplemented by the service contract, did not provide
enough income to offset the logger’s costs to treat Unit 16.
The missing firewood market certainly contributed to this
unfortunate financial situation, but by how much? This
question is answered here by conducting a what-if analysis

summer of 2001.

using the previous cost and revenue model modified to
include a firewood market that: (1) was located about 75
miles from Unit 16; (2) could purchase all the logs harvested
from the 5 to 7.9 in. dbh trees; and (3) was willing to pay
$23/green ton for delivered logs.
The additional logs equated to approximately 34
truckloads of wood. Each load incurred new costs beyond
that seen in the actual project due to loading and trucking.
These additional costs were estimated to be $8,071. No
other additional costs were incurred, as harvest costs had
already been accounted for as part of the actual unit costs.
In contrast, the sale of these smaller logs represented an
increase to market-derived income by $13,072. The revenue
stream, which included firewood, pallets, vigas, and the
service contract, totaled $133,905. In this analysis, the
pallet mill price structure was the same as in the original
analysis of the actual market conditions; the price it would
pay for the logs approximately two-thirds of the way
through the treatment of Unit 16 was reduced. Figure 4
shows the relative contribution of each income sector.
Firewood is estimated to contribute 10% to the total
revenue stream.
A comparison between all incurred costs to total income
provides a slightly better result than the actual summer of
2001 situation. Instead of losing money, the logger would
realize a small profit of $1,718, equivalent to $20.20/ac.
Conclusions
Forest restoration and fuels reduction projects are often
considered cost prohibitive. It is expensive to harvest small
trees and there are few suitable markets located near the
projects that can afford to pay for the true cost of this wood.
This case study, enhanced by analyzing costs and income via
an economic model, provides some insights into these cost
prohibitive claims.
The work presented here focused on the costs and income
opportunities for an 85 ac, GFFP unit located in the WUI of
Flagstaff, AZ that was thinned during the summer of 2001.

logs—detrimentally affected the logger’s net return. If these
changes had not occurred, Unit 16 could have provided a small
profit of $7,857 or $92.44/ac to the direct-cost logger Instead,
the logger lost, as estimated via a cost and revenue model,
$3,284 or $38.63/ac. The logger’s actual costs were estimated
to total $124,117 or $1,460.20/ac and his estimated income
totaled $120,833 or $1,421.57/ac.
Unit 16, through a cooperative agreement between the
GFFP and the Forest Service, was a GFFP project where the
Forest Service conveyed the timber to GFFP at no cost and the
GFFP funded the thinning work. The GFFP’s net costs, as a
function of the service contract with an embedded timber fee,
totaled $17,000 or $200/ac.
Also presented in this article was an estimate of the costs
incurred by the Peaks Ranger District of the Coconino National
Forest to prepare this unit for thinning and to conduct the post
thinning activities. This estimate totaled $31,960 or $376/ac.
This work suggests that the net costs, incurred by the
GFFP, the Ranger District, and the logger to complete the
initial thinning and burning actions over this 85 ac unit of
ponderosa pine forests, equaled a staggering $2,036/ac.
Privately raised funds by the GFFP and income from the sale
of the harvested logs offset these costs by 9.8 and 57.5%,
respectively. The Forest Service and the logger assumed the
remaining costs.
A better market for the merchantable wood—one that is
located closer to the forests of northern Arizona, one that
could pay more for the wood, or one that could utilize wood
from trees <8 in. dbh, as well as the larger trees—would
certainly enhance the current economic realities of these types
of projects. Loggers could realize a profit, reinvest, and grow
their businesses. The Forest Service, or in this case the GFFP,
could recoup some of their costs vs. paying the logger to thin
and remove trees.
Without these more suitable markets, it may become
harder to complete on-the-ground projects. Logging contractors
cannot stay in business under the conditions analyzed here,
unless their service rates increase. Increased service rates
without a comparable increase in Forest Service project dollars
or without private donations from cooperators like the GFFP,
will limit thinning, which is an important strategy for restoring
forests and reducing fuels in the WUI.
