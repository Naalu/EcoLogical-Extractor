Spatial scales are known to influence the form of the productivitydiversity relationship, but less attention has been given
to the influence of temporal scales. Interannual climatic variation in semi-arid ponderosa pinebunchgrass ecosystems
causes significant year-to-year differences in herbaceous production. We hypothesized that unimodal (or ‘hump-backed’)
relationships would be detected between herbaceous production and species richness in wet years, whereas positive
logarithmic relationships would be detected in dry years. We analyzed nine years of herbaceous production and species
richness data and used Akaike’s information criterion (AICc) to determine the weight of evidence for each model in each
year. As predicted, species richness exhibited a unimodal relationship to herbaceous production in wet years; however,
richness exhibited a logarithmic relationship with herbaceous production in dry years. These results suggest that
competitive exclusion occurred within this semi-arid plant community in years of high production when enough
moisture was available to drive abundant plant growth. Thus, just as it is important to sample broad spatial variation in
production to detect the full unimodal productivitydiversity relationship, it is also important to recognize that the full
unimodal curve may be undetectable in less productive dry years in semi-arid ecosystems.
Spatial and temporal scales in ecology are critical compo-
nents in the measurement of ecological processes (Huston
1999, Schneider 2001). Reviews and multi-scale analyses of
productivitydiversity relationships have suggested that the
form of this relationship changes across spatial scales
(Waide et al. 1999, Gross et al. 2000, Mittelbach et al.
2001). For example, unimodal, or ‘hump-backed’ relation-
ships (Grime 1973, 1979, Huston 1979, 1994) between
productivity and diversity are often detected over spatial
scales that encompass several community types (Moore and
Keddy 1989), whereas positive monotonic relationships are
often detected at the continental or global scale (Waide
et al. 1999). Less attention has been given to temporal scales
when examining this relationship (but see Guo 2003, Cox
et al. 2006), likely since many studies have been short-term.
Aboveground net primary production in grassland
systems is strongly related to regional (Walter 1979, Sala
et al. 1988, Epstein et al. 1997) and temporal (Lauenroth
and Sala 1992, Silvertown et al. 1994, Briggs and Knapp
1995) precipitation gradients. Species richness has been
shown to increase linearly with precipitation over regional
spatial gradients, but richness within sites was poorly
correlated with interannual climatic variability (Adler and
Levine 2007). However, if climate affects production and if
production affects species richness, then it is possible that
climate-induced temporal variation in primary production
could mediate an indirect effect on species richness.
We hypothesized that unimodal productivitydiversity
relationships would be detected in wet years, whereas
positive logarithmic relationships would be detected in
dry years since less production would decrease the like-
lihood of competitive exclusion (Grime 1979, Huston
1994). We used a nine year dataset from a ponderosa
pine (Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum)  bunchgrass
ecosystem to evaluate this hypothesis.
Methods
This study was conducted at the G. A. Pearson Natural Area
in northern Arizona about 10 km northwest of Flagstaff,
Arizona USA. We measured peak aboveground herbaceous
standing crop and species richness in 55 plots (each
consisting of 2-m2 quadrats) in 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996,
1998, 1999, 2002, 2004 and 2005 in early September of
each year (Moore et al. 2006). All live herbaceous
vegetation rooted in the 2-m2 quadrats was clipped to
ground-level (approximately 2 cm stubble height). Plant
clippings were dried at 708C for 48 h prior to weighing.
Peak aboveground herbaceous standing crop is a reasonable
approximation of aboveground herbaceous net primary
production (hereafter, ‘herbaceous production’) in this
ecosystem since the study area was fenced to exclude
ungulate herbivores (Bonham 1989). The 55 plots spanned
a gradient of low to high herbaceous production, caused

primarily by variation in overstory tree density (Laughlin
et al. 2006). Thus, our sample spans a broad range of
production both within years (due to gradients in overstory
tree density) and across
years (due to variation in
interannual climate).
The years in which sampling occurred varied widely in
annual precipitation and Palmer drought severity index
(PDSI) values. PDSI uses temperature and rainfall informa-
tion to determine regional dryness (Heddinghaus and Sabol
1991) and ranges from 4 (extremely dry) to 4 (extremely
wet). We obtained monthly PDSI values from the National
Climatic Data Center (/<www.ncdc.noaa.gov/>) for the
Flagstaff, Arizona region. We calculated yearly PDSI values
by averaging monthly values from the previous October
though September to capture the annual PDSI for the
annual water year (e.g. for 1992, we averaged monthly
PDSI values from 1 October 1991 through 30 September
1992).
First, we confirmed the well-known relationship between
interannual climatic variability and herbaceous production
in our system. Grassland production is a positive function
of temporal variation in precipitation (Lauenroth and Sala
1992, Silvertown et al. 1994, Briggs and Knapp 1995).
Thus, rather than attempting to reject an obviously false
null hypothesis, we calculated Bayesian 95% credible
intervals of the parameter estimates for the term relating
PDSI to average herbaceous production. For these intervals,
there is a 95% chance that the true value of the parameter
will be within the interval (McCarthy 2007).
We quantified the average herbaceous production within
each year. These averages were natural log (ln) transformed
prior to analysis to eliminate heteroskedasticity of model
residuals. We regressed herbaceous production on PDSI. In
addition, we evaluated whether there were lag effects of
climate on production by including the previous year’s
PDSI as a second term in the model. We also evaluated the
relationship between species richness and PDSI. Regression
analyses were conducted in WinBUGS ver. 1.4 using flat
(or uninformative) priors, since we did not have prior
knowledge about parameter distributions (Spiegelhalter
et al. 2003). A total of 100 000 Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) samples were drawn from the posterior
distributions. The first 10 000 samples (iterations) of the
MCMC run were discarded as burn-in so as not to
adversely affect the posterior distributions.
Second,
we
used
the
second-order
bias
corrected
Akaike’s information criterion (AICc) to evaluate how the
form of the productivity-diversity relationship changes with
temporal variation in climate. The first step in model
selection is the articulation of biologically plausible models
(Johnson and Omland 2004). Each model is composed of a
response variable (species richness) and a list of predictor
variables. Though positive monotonic relationships between
productivity and diversity are common in the literature
(Waide et al. 1999, Mittelbach et al. 2001), we did not
include this monotonic model in our set since we knew a
priori that the relationship was nonlinear in the pine
bunchgrass ecosystem (Laughlin et al. 2007). Thus, for
each year, we confronted two statistical models with data: 1)
the logarithmic model (where the natural log (ln) of
herbaceous production is the single predictor variable),
and 2) the unimodal model (a model with three terms that
includes natural log-transformed herbaceous production,
herbaceous
production,
and
herbaceous
production-
squared). We included the natural log transformed variable
in the unimodal model, which is typically a simple
quadratic polynomial, in order to capture the steep
ascending portion of the curve.
We used the following to calculate a second-order bias
corrected AIC:
AICc21n(L( ˆu))2K2K(K  1)
n  K  1
where L(/ ˆu) is the likelihood, K is the number of model
parameters (including the intercept and s2), and n is the
number of sample units (n55). The ln(L(/ ˆu)) was
calculated by multiplying ln(residual sums of squares) by
n/2 (Burnham and Anderson 2002). Residual sums of
squares were calculated in JMP-IN ver. 5.1 software (SAS
2004). Within each year, the AICc value for each model was
rescaled to Di by subtracting the minimum AICc from each
of the other model’s AICc. The resulting Di values were
then converted to Akaike weights (wi):

The wi of the models in the set sum to 1; each wi can be
interpreted as the weight of evidence in favor of model i

Akaike weights for the unimodal model on PDSI to
evaluate whether climatic variation may influence the
form of the relationship between productivity and diversity.

Results and discussion
Herbaceous production in this pinebunchgrass ecosystem
was a function of temporal variation in climate. Interannual
variation in PDSI explained 65% of the variation in average
herbaceous production (Fig. 1). The Bayesian 95% credible
interval (hereafter, 95% CI) for the effect of PDSI on
herbaceous production was 0.2890.19. These results
concur qualitatively with other studies in grassland ecosys-
tems (Lauenroth and Sala 1992, Silvertown et al. 1994,
Briggs and Knapp 1995). Our model predicts that produc-
tion decreases slightly from PDSI values of 4 down to 2,
but then production falls sharply between 2 and 4
(Fig. 1). A simple linear regression model explained much
less variation (R20.45) than the logarithmic model (R2
0.65). This suggests that herbaceous production is fairly
robust to moderate drought conditions (between PDSI
values of 0 and 2), but that herbaceous production
declines dramatically in extreme drought conditions (be-
tween PDSI values of 2 and 4). We included a second
term (previous year’s PDSI) to test for lag effects of climate
on production, but the signal was weak and the negative
term did not explain any additional variation in herbaceous
production.
Herbaceous species richness was not correlated with
PDSI. Though severe drought may reduce species richness
temporarily (Laughlin et al. 2008), our results concur with
Adler and Levine (2007) who detected no relationship
between interannual variation in precipitation and species
richness at their southern mixed-grass prairie site at Hays,
Kansas, USA.
The form of the relationship between herbaceous
production and plant species richness differed among years
(Fig. 2). As predicted, herbaceous production exhibited a
unimodal relationship to species richness in wet years,
suggesting that competitive exclusion occurred within the
herbaceous community in years of high primary produc-
tion, which is consistent with Grime’s (1973, 1979) model.
In contrast, herbaceous production exhibited logarithmic
relations with richness in dry years, suggesting that
competitive exclusion and recruitment limitation occurred
only in years when enough moisture was available to drive

abundant plant growth. Festuca arizonica, Lupinus argenteus,
Elymus elymoides and Verbascum thapsus were species that
dominated the productive yet species-poor plots, suggesting
that these species have a competitive advantage in wet years
and can exclude subordinate species.
We acknowledge that the unimodal models appear to be
driven by only one or a few data points at the high end of
the production gradient. However, there are two reasons
why we do not consider these to be outliers: 1) the
unimodal model has been supported in another indepen-
dent dataset in this ecosystem (Laughlin et al. 2007), and 2)
second-order polynomial models are still supported in the
wet years after rerunning the analyses when the point with
the greatest production was removed (unpubl.). Therefore,
we simply have fewer data points at the high end of the
production gradient.
We assessed the weight of evidence for each model
within each year (Table 1) and found that the weight of
evidence in support of the unimodal model increased
with PDSI values (Fig. 3). PDSI accounted for 45% of
the variability in Akaike weights for the unimodal model.
The 95% CI for the effect of PDSI on Akaike weight’s
for the unimodal model was 0.0990.08, suggesting that a
one unit increase in PDSI results in a 9% increase in
support for the unimodal model. The form of the relation-
ship was consistently unimodal in moderate to extremely
wet years (PDSI2) and consistently logarithmic in
moderate to extremely dry years (PDSIB2). However,
in average years (PDSI between 2 and 2) the form of the
relationship was more variable about the regression line
(Fig. 3), suggesting that our ability to predict the occurrence
(or lack) of competitive exclusion can only be done with
certainty within very wet (or very dry) years. Some of this
uncertainty may be explained by other disturbances (e.g.
arthropod herbivory) that can cause positive relationships to
be detected in moderate years.
Temporal variation in the productivitydiversity rela-
tionship has also been detected in an arid Chihuahuan
desert ecosystem, where unimodal ‘envelopes’ (i.e. a cloud

of data points with a unimodal upper limit), rather than
true nonlinear relationships, were observed (Cox et al.
2006). In some years, a positive linear relationship was
supported by their data, in contrast to the logarithmic form
detected in our study. Interannual climatic variability may
have also played a role in the different relationships
observed among years in that desert ecosystem.
Our results have two main implications. First, our data
suggest that climatic variability can potentially affect plant
species interactions (specifically, competitive interactions)
in southwestern ponderosa pinebunchgrass ecosystems.
The form of the relationship between species richness and
primary production is influenced by the spatial scale of
measurement (Waide et al. 1999, Gross et al. 2000,
Mittelbach et al. 2001). Interestingly, when the relationship
is analyzed at the broadest spatial pattern possible (e.g. at a
global extent with large spatial grain sizes), the relationship
is often positive monotonic (Waide et al. 1999). This
suggests that competitive exclusion cannot be detected at
such large spatial grains and extents (Huston 1999), and
that other mechanisms must drive the positive pattern
detected at the global scale. Our study suggests that the
productivitydiversity relationship also changes over tem-
poral scales in systems with highly variable interannual
precipitation when measured at small spatial grain sizes (2
m2). Thus, just as it is important to sample broad spatial
variation in primary production to detect the full unimodal
productivitydiversity
relationship
(Moore
and
Keddy
1989, Guo and Berry 1998), it is also important to
recognize that the full unimodal curve may be undetectable
in less productive dry years in semi-arid or sub-humid
ecosystems.
Thus,
climate-induced
changes
to
the
productivitydiversity relationship must be considered
when interpreting diversity models in ecosystems where
interannual variation in precipitation is extreme.
Second, these results can inform predictions about future
changes in production and diversity due to climate change.
Modeling future changes in precipitation regimes is challen-
ging yet crucial for the management of terrestrial ecosystems
(Weltzin et al. 2003). Though uncertainty still exists, climate
models are projecting that the southwestern United States
will experience drier conditions in the 21st century (Seager
et al. 2007). If these models are correct, then herbaceous
primary production will be lower than the historical average,
which will affect many management decisions. For example,
the use and control of fire will be affected since fire is
dependent on continuous surface fuels for lateral spread, and
the use of public land for grazing will be affected since
livestock operations and native grazers are dependent on
productive grasslands. Changes in species richness, however,
may lag in response to long-term climate change (Mene´ndez
et al. 2006). We do not expect concomitant declines in
species richness with increasing drought because we and
Adler and Levine (2007) detected no effect of temporal
variation in precipitation within a site on species richness,
richness is generally highest at intermediate levels of biomass
(Grime 1973, 1979, Huston 1979), and most species in this
semi-arid ecosystem are adapted to at least moderate drought
conditions. Laughlin et al. (2008) detected short-term
reductions in richness caused by severe drought in 2002,
but the effects of chronic drought stress on community
diversity needs to be examined in subsequent studies.
