ABSTRACT. Old growth in the frequent-fire conifer forests of the western United States, such as those containing
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), Jeffrey pine (P. jeffreyi), giant sequoia (Sequioa giganteum) and other species,
has undergone major changes since Euro-American settlement. Understanding past changes and anticipating future
changes under different potential management scenarios are fundamental to developing ecologically based fuel
reduction or ecological restoration treatments. Some of the many changes that have occurred in these forests include
shifts from historically frequent surface fire to no fire or to stand-replacing fire regimes, increases in tree density,
increased abundance of fire-intolerant trees, decreases in understory productivity, hydrological alterations, and
accelerated mortality of old trees. Although these changes are widespread, the magnitude and causes of changes may
vary within and among landscapes. Agents of change, such as fire exclusion or livestock grazing, likely interacted
and had multiple effects. For example, historical ranching operations may have altered both fire regimes and
understory vegetation, and facilitated institutional fire exclusion through fragmentation and settlement. Evidence
exists for large variation in presettlement characteristics and current condition of old growth across this broad forest
region, although there are many examples of striking similarities on widely distant landscapes. Exotic species, climate
change, unnatural stand-replacing wildfires, and other factors will likely continue to degrade or eradicate old growth
in many areas. As a policy of fire exclusion is proving to be unsustainable, mechanical tree thinning, prescribed fire,
or wildland fire use will likely be key options for forestalling continued eradication of old growth by severe crown
fires. For many practical and societal reasons, the wildland–urban interface may afford some of the most immediate
opportunities for re-establishing old growth typical of presettlement forests resistant to crown fires.

INTRODUCTION
Ecological and human values of old-growth forests
frequently differ from those of younger forests. For
instance, old forests provide optimal habitat for
some wildlife species, harbor unique genetic
diversity, and have provided large-diameter wood
products to society (Kaufmann et al. 1992, Johnson
1994, Barbour et al. 2002). Old forests also provide
other ecosystem services that may become
increasingly important to society, such as carbon
sequestration and watershed hydrology (Tecle and
Covington 1991). The values of old forests result
from many long-lived ecosystem components,
including, but not limited to, trees. Sagebrush
(Artemisia tridentata), for example, a major shrub
species of many frequent-fire forests in the western
United States, can live for more than 70 years
(Roughton 1972). There also can be old-growth ant
colonies, as another example. Harvester ant
(Pogonomyrmex owyheei) colonies can live for 30
years, with the mounds potentially reactivated by
future colonies so that an individual ant mound can
persist for centuries (Porter and Jorgensen 1988).
Old-growth forests have become rare across the
United States, including in frequent-fire conifer
forests of the West. These forests are one of the most
extensive forest types in the western United States,
covering tens of millions of hectares from Texas
west and north to eastern Washington (Brown 1994,
Everett et al. 1994, Kaufmann et al. 2004). Concerns
by the public, resource managers, and scientists
about deleterious conditions in both old and young

frequent-fire forests have led to calls for region-
wide fuel reduction and ecological restoration
treatments (Covington et al. 1994, Dahms and Geils
1997, Keeley and Stephenson 2000). Ecologically
based forest management requires understanding
disturbance regimes and ranges of variability in old-
growth forests before onset of deleterious
conditions, the suite of changes that have taken
place, and the mechanisms underlying the changes
(Cooper 1960, Vankat and Major 1978, Grissino-
Mayer et al. 2004).
Our objectives are to provide an overview of
changes that have occurred since Euro-American
settlement in coniferous, old-growth, frequent-fire
forests in the western United States, and to
hypothesize anticipated changes in old growth that
may result from potential management and policy
scenarios. An exhaustive literature review is beyond
the scope of this manuscript. Rather, we synthesize
general principles, supported with examples from
research conducted throughout the region. We begin
by briefly summarizing the ecology of western
frequent-fire conifer forests, the evolutionary
environment concept as related to changes in old
growth, and a broad old-growth classification
defined for this manuscript.
Western Frequent-fire Conifer Forests
There is a continuum of fire frequencies in western
forests (Swetnam and Baisan 1996, Caprio and
Lineback 2002, Agee 2003), and in this review, we
consider forests with average fire-return intervals
of generally less than 20 years to be frequent-fire
forests. Overstories of frequent-fire conifer forests
often consist of pure or mixed ponderosa pine (Pinus
ponderosa), Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), giant
sequoia (Sequoia giganteum), and various other
species, such as western larch (Larix occidentalis)
or Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) (Biswell
1972, Habeck 1990, Brown 1994). These forests
occupy parts of western Texas, New Mexico,
Arizona, Utah, Nevada, California, Oregon,
Washington, Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming (Little
1971). Many of these forests historically had fire-
return intervals far less than 20 years, such as 9 years
in Jeffrey pine forests in the eastern Sierra Nevada
Mountains (Stephens 2001), 7 years in ponderosa
pine–western larch forests in western Montana
(Habeck 1990), and 10 years on average for several
studies in giant sequoia forests in California (Caprio
and Lineback 2002; Table 1). Some forests
containing these species, e.g., some areas of
ponderosa pine in the Colorado Front Range or in
the South Dakota Black Hills, also may have
exhibited lengthier fire return intervals (Shinneman
and Baker 1997, Brown et al. 2000). Forests
characterized by stand-replacing fire regimes are
not covered in this review. Many fires before Euro-
American settlement in western frequent-fire
forests are thought to have resulted from lightning
ignitions (Swetnam and Baisan 1996), although
there may have been some areas where Native
American ignitions augmented fire frequencies
(Agee 2003). Euro-American settlement varied in
time and pattern within this forest region, although
it generally occurred from the mid-1800s to the early
1900s (Stephenson 1999, Ehle and Baker 2003,
Taylor and Beaty 2005). Uneven-agedness is an
often-cited characteristic of overstory trees of
presettlement or contemporary old-growth frequent-
fire forests, apparently resulting from an individual-
tree replacement or patch-scale regeneration pattern
(White 1985). Sub-canopy tree composition varies,
ranging from an absence of sub-canopy trees in
some forests, to well-developed sub-canopies
including Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii),
mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus),
junipers (Juniperus spp.), and other species.
Understories also vary widely, ranging from grassy
understories (Kerns et al. 2003) to shrub-dominated
or sparsely vegetated understories (Evett et al.
2006).
The Evolutionary Environment Concept
The concept of an evolutionary environment is
central to understanding past forest changes and
management needs for old-growth, frequent-fire
forests. An evolutionary environment refers to the
range of natural variability in ecological conditions
in which a species or groups of species evolved
(Morgan et al. 1994, Covington et al. 1999, Moore
et al. 1999). In the context of contemporary
ecosystems, the relevant evolutionary environment
is often judged to be the past several thousand years,
sometimes estimated as 50–100 times the average
life span of the longest-lived ecological dominants.
Based on this relationship, MacArthur (1972)
concluded that "...the length of time it normally
takes for a species to split and diverge sufficiently
to be regarded as two species is a small, uncertain
number of thousands of years." In North America,
the recent evolutionary environment is often

considered to include Native Americans as
participants in evolutionary processes during the
past 10 000 years (Parsons et al. 1986). Over
evolutionary time, species not only adapt to their
evolutionary environment, but they may also come
to depend on those conditions for their continued
survival (Wilson 1992). Thus, the greatest threat to
biological diversity is the loss of evolutionary
habitats, and the greatest hope for reversing the
losses is restoration of these habitats. Frequent
surface fire was a dominant component of the
evolutionary environment of the coniferous forests
covered in this review. The rapidity and extent of
fire exclusion and other alterations associated with
Euro-American settlement are considered unprecedented
in the recent evolutionary environment of frequent-
fire forests, and responsible for disrupting
evolutionary trajectories and leading to pervasive
ecosystem degradation (Biswell 1972, Allen et al.
2002).
Old-growth Classification
For the purpose of this review, we broadly classified
old-growth forests into five types (Table 2). Most
forest 
area 
existing 
before 
Euro-American
settlement probably could be considered old
growth, perhaps excepting locally cleared areas. We
broadly differentiate two types of present old
growth: unharvested forests dominated by old trees,
and developing old growth consisting of older trees
that are to be managed to attain old-growth
characteristics (e.g., Morgan et al. 2002). Two types
of future old growth represent the perpetuation of
current or developing old growth.
CHANGES AND AGENTS OF CHANGE
Many agents, such as livestock grazing, fire
exclusion and predator control (e.g., wolf
eradication), began changing frequent-fire, old-
growth forests in earnest following Euro-American
settlement (Table 3). Some agents, such as fire
exclusion partly resulting from a federal policy of
suppressing fire starts in the western states, were
widespread. Other agents may have varied in
importance within and among landscapes, as they
do today. For example, hydrological or vegetation
modification by livestock ranching may have been
most intense near watering areas within landscapes
(Milchunas 2006). Many of the agents in Table 3
interacted with other agents and had multiple
effects. For instance, both a policy of fire
suppression and livestock grazing that may have
decreased fine fuels in some areas could have
contributed to fire exclusion (Madany and West
1983). In addition to potentially affecting fire
regimes, multiple effects of this historical grazing
also may have included reducing the abundance of
palatable plant species and increasing soil erosion
in some areas (Belsky and Blumenthal 1997). The
following sections highlight some key historical
changes occurring in frequent-fire old forests since
settlement.
Fire Regimes
As frequent surface fire is thought to have shaped
the evolutionary environment of frequent-fire
conifer forests, the cessation of frequent fire through
human activities has been cited as the most drastic
change in these forests (Vankat and Major 1978,
Keeling et al. 2006). In the past 100 years, many
forests have “missed” more than 20 fires that would
have occurred had evolutionary trajectories been
allowed to continue (Table 1). It is not surprising
that this alteration has been implicated in many
changes in old-growth forests, including fuel
buildups, tree density increases, shifts to fire-
intolerant trees, and alterations to understory plant
composition (Kilgore 1971, Bonnicksen and Stone
1982). In particular, presettlement fires are thought
to have partly regulated tree regeneration, possibly
restricting regeneration to small fire-free “safe
sites” (White 1985). Although fire exclusion has
been a dominant occurrence since Euro-American
settlement, it should not be overlooked that a period
of severe fires associated with logging operations
or other human activities may have briefly occurred
following settlement in some areas before the
initiation of fire exclusion (Smith and Fischer 1997).
In current old-growth forests managed with
prescribed fire, the fires are often not synchronous
with the timing of presettlement fires. For example,
Fulé et al. (1997) found that 40% of presettlement
fires occurred in spring (late April to June) and 60%
occurred in summer (July to early September) in
northern 
Arizona 
ponderosa 
pine 
forests.
Contemporary prescribed burns often occur in late
fall or spring when fire is considered easier to
control. Fall fires may reduce the abundance of
warm-season grasses in forests where they are major

effect in other forest types and vary with understory
composition (Metlen and Fiedler 2006).
Tree Composition
Tree species dominant in presettlement forests had
abilities for coping with frequent fire, such as thick
bark or the production of plentiful seeds because
many seedlings would be consumed by fire (Weaver
1947). Although not all areas of this forest region
have exhibited increases in fire-intolerant species
since Euro-American settlement, fire-intolerant
species have proliferated in many areas (Zier and
Baker 2006). Increases in these species can expand
ladder fuels, modify soil characteristics due to
differences in litter chemistry, and alter understory
composition because of changes in solar radiation,
canopy interception of precipitation, soil chemistry,
or other factors (Moir 1966).
Tree Structure and Pattern
Probably the most striking and consistent change in
old-growth forests since Euro-American settlement
is burgeoning tree density, whether these increases
result from dramatic population increases of
original fire-adapted dominants, such as Jeffrey
pine, invasion by fire-intolerant species, or both
(Table 4). For example, more than 50 times more
ponderosa pine trees currently occur in old-growth
forests of the Gus Pearson Natural Area in northern
Arizona than occurred in 1876 at the time of
settlement (Mast et al. 1999). Although the
magnitude of tree-density increases varies within
and among landscapes, most studies have found that
densities have at least tripled since settlement (Table
4). In addition to increases in canopy trees, sub-
canopy trees such as Gambel oak also have irrupted
in some areas (Fulé et al. 1997).
The proportion of trees in the largest diameter size
classes have sharply decreased since Euro-
American settlement, with the largest proportion of
trees occupying small-diameter classes in current
forests (Boyden et al. 2005). Old, large trees have
been selectively harvested. The mortality of old
trees has probably increased above that of natural
attrition in many areas because of high densities of
competing young trees, escalating insect or disease
outbreaks, or increased stress due to climate change
(Woodall et al. 2003, Breshears et al. 2005).
Although there are some exceptions, such as a
random distribution found in an Oregon ponderosa
pine stand (Youngblood et al. 2004), presettlement
and current live old-growth trees often exhibit a
clumped distribution within sites (Harrod et al.
1999). Thus, openings alternating with tree clumps
typify within-forest patterns in many frequent-fire
conifer forests. Tree density increases have resulted
in the nearly complete or complete eradication of
openings (Bonnicksen and Stone 1982, Zier and
Baker 2006). These openings are important for
understory vegetation, wildlife habitat, and
aesthetic value (Tecle and Covington 1991).

Understory Vegetation
Three of the primary agents of change in understory
composition and productivity have been greater tree
density, livestock grazing, and fire exclusion
(Vankat and Major 1978). Understory productivity
has declined in many areas, resulting from a well-
documented negative relationship between tree
density and understory biomass (Clary 1975). A
shift to increasing proportions of ecosystem
biomass in woody plants relative to herbaceous
plants is a common response to fire exclusion in
many frequent-fire ecosystems, such as southern
Texas grasslands (Archer 1990).
Livestock grazing has been cited as the most
ubiquitous land use in the West, with the
consequence that virtually no examples exist of old-
growth 
forests 
with 
ungrazed 
understories
(Milchunas 2006). Livestock density, including
cattle, sheep, and horses, burgeoned in western
forests through the 1800s. Disturbance caused by
ranching operations preceded institutional fire
suppression in many areas, and was often the earliest
Euro-American disruption to old-growth forests
(Belsky and Blumenthal 1997). Early ranching also
facilitated subsequent settlement and its associated
impacts (e.g., road building) to old-growth forests.

frequent-fire forests, the geographic distribution
and the high intensity of herbivory associated with
livestock appear unprecedented.
When livestock exceed the carrying capacity of the
land, they can affect understory plant communities
directly by trampling or preferentially eating
palatable species, either killing the plants or
removing biomass or reproductive structures
(Belsky and Blumenthal 1997). Heavy grazing can
indirectly impact plants by affecting soils, native
wildlife, and tree regeneration. By reducing
competition from grasses and wildflowers,
overgrazing may have contributed to tree-density
increases and fire-regime disruption in western
forests (Belsky and Blumenthal 1997). It is
generally acknowledged that overgrazing occurred
in many areas near the turn of the last century and
that it exceeded the sustainable carrying capacity of
the land (Covington et al. 1994). Grazing continues
in many contemporary old-growth forests, although
often the grazing is less heavy than historically.
Nevertheless, vegetation state-and-transition modeling
and other research suggest that compositional shifts
resulting from early livestock grazing persist to the
present in some areas, forming new, stable
vegetation types often of inferior grazing quality
than the original vegetation (Briske et al. 2005).
Changes in understory communities probably vary
substantially both within and among landscapes,
depending on both historical and contemporary
disturbances, environmental site factors, and local
species pools. For example, using phytolith (plant

Ecology and Society 12(2): 16
http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol12/iss2/art16/
fossil) analysis in a California giant sequoia stand,
Evett et al. (2006) found that grasses were sparse in
presettlement understories as they are today.
Conversely, following a phytolith analysis, Kerns
et al. (2001) suggested that the abundance of grasses
has decreased since Euro-American settlement in
an old-growth Arizona ponderosa pine forest.
Soils and Hydrology
Since forest patterns often consist of tree clumps
interspersed with canopy openings, different soils
may develop below the different vegetation if the
patch locations are stable for long time periods (i.
e., for several generations of trees). Kerns et al.
(2003) provided evidence that soils in grassy
openings had thicker A horizons and higher pH than
soils below old-growth clumps of ponderosa pine.
This pattern of long-term soil development could
have important ecological implications. For
example, in an eastern Washington study, Moir
(1966) found that grass biomass was 72% greater
in soils collected below openings than below
ponderosa pine. These findings suggest that
converting tree patches to grassy patches and vice
versa could result in soil homogenization, and may
decrease grass productivity.
Other changes in soil properties in old-growth
forests may have resulted from fire exclusion, tree-
density increases, livestock grazing, changes in
understory composition, or other factors. These
changes may be as wide ranging as increases in soil
bulk density in trampled areas of high livestock
concentrations to accumulation of allelopathic
chemicals from conifer litter because of increasing
O horizons (litter and duff) during fire exclusion
(Gundale and DeLuca 2006). Contemporary
experiments provide some suggestions of potential
changes in soil nutrient concentrations. For
example, DeLuca and Sala (2006) found that forests
at Montana and Idaho study sites burning as few as
three times in the past 100 years had decreased total
soil nitrogen, but greater available nitrogen than less
frequently burned forests.
Because of their importance for human activities,
the hydrology of springs and riparian areas often
represents one of the characteristics most heavily
modified by Euro-American settlement. Ranching
operations 
resulted 
in 
pervasive 
diversion,
damming, or piping of springs and drainages, with
these 
alterations 
often 
causing 
long-term
degradation of water supplies (Dahms and Geils
1997). In addition to greater human use of limited
water 
supplies, 
post-settlement 
tree-density
increases may also have altered water balances in
some areas. For example, in a 4-year study, Brown
et al. (1974) reported that streamflow increased on
average 22% per year after tree thinning removed
75% of ponderosa pine basal area on the Beaver
Creek watershed in Arizona. A grazing treatment
(60% utilization of perennial grasses) increased
streamflow only 8%, suggesting that the relative
amounts of tree and understory biomass, which has
been altered since Euro-American settlement, may
affect water yield.
Wildlife
Predator control, hunting or trapping, livestock
operations, fragmentation, and changing forest
structure together with other factors have probably
all affected wildlife. Some wildlife species, such as
beaver (Castor canadensis) or gray wolves (Canis
lupus), were driven to extinction regionally in the
1900s (Dahms and Geils 1997). Other species that
benefit from dense forests have likely increased.
Some game species also have increased, sometimes
due to creation of supplemental water sources by
game managers.
Compounding Effects and Thresholds
One view of ecosystems holds that ecosystems will
adjust catastrophically to perturbations that exceed
thresholds (Suding et al. 2004). Stand-replacing
crown fire represents a catastrophic adjustment to
change in old-growth forests formerly regulated by
frequent surface fire (Scheffer et al. 2001). This
adjustment can be viewed as catastrophic because
it removes for centuries the long-lived ecologically
dominant coniferous trees in frequent-fire forests.
Savage and Mast (2005), for example, described a
potential successional sequence where ponderosa
pine forests were replaced by shrubfields forming a
new, persistent vegetation type. Although these
shrubfields 
also 
have 
ecological

ANTICIPATED CHANGES
Fire
Given current trends of increasing wildfire size and
severity, coupled with climatic projections for
enhancement of weather conditions promoting fire
(Schoennagel et al. 2004), it seems probable that
stand-replacing wildfire will continue to jeopardize
or destroy existing old growth. These fires may have
far-reaching effects on unburned old growth, such
as potentially serving as focal points for exotic
species infestations (Keeley 2006). Some of the
most severe and extensive fires in recorded history
have occurred in the last decade, illustrating that a
policy of fire suppression cannot be successful
indefinitely. McKenzie et al. (2004) compared
temperature and precipitation of recorded wildfires
in 11 western states, and then projected the effects
of predicted climate change. Even in the best-case
scenario with the smallest temperature increase,
only 1.6°C, the area burned was forecast to double
by 2100. Extrapolation of fire and climatic trends is
an imprecise science, but considering that roughly
8% of the ponderosa pine forest in Arizona was
burned in the 2002 Rodeo-Chediski Fire, it seems
unlikely that it will take until 2100 to severely burn
the majority of western frequent-fire forests,
including most remaining old growth.
Tree Composition and Structure
Fire exclusion and climate change may represent
conflicting factors affecting changes in tree species
composition. Fire-intolerant species, which often
exhibit a more mesic affinity, have increased in
some areas during fire exclusion (Barbour et al.
2002). These species may continue to increase under
continued fire exclusion. Conversely, climate
change may result in an expansion of dry, fire-
tolerant species, such as ponderosa pine (Heinlein
et al. 2005). Thus, in the absence of fire, changes in
tree composition may vary with elevation and with
other environmental factors that affect moisture
availability and growing conditions for trees.
Understory Vegetation
Understory vegetation in old-growth forests will
likely continue to be affected by livestock grazing,
elevated tree densities, lack of surface fire, and
exotic plants. Livestock grazing decreased through
the 1900s in some areas, but grazing intensity will
likely continue to vary within and among
landscapes. Based on state-and-transition models,
Briske et al. (2005) suggest that the recovery of
understory composition to that resembling a
presettlement forest may be slow or non-existent
with or without further livestock grazing. Changes
in plant composition with changing levels of grazing
pressure will likely vary with precipitation, soil
types, future disturbances, and the species available
in regional species pools (Abella and Covington
2006). Similar considerations also apply to potential
changes in plant composition resulting from
continued elevated tree densities. Openings may
serve as refuges for understory plants, but these
openings may further shrink with tree canopy
encroachment. Protracted lack of fire may further
reduce regeneration microsites, as accumulating
litter layers become too thick to support plant
establishment even given sufficient propagules
(Laughlin et al. 2004). Exotic plants are particularly
troubling because they may persist after wildfire or
forest management activities designed to restore old
growth (Fornwalt et al. 2003). Cheatgrass (Bromus
tectorum) provides an example of potential effects
of exotic plants, as this species establishes dense
stands of continuous and highly flammable fuel that
can hinder the restoration of a low-intensity surface
fire regime (Keeley 2006).
Wildlife
It is difficult to generalize anticipated effects of
forest conditions on wildlife except that continued
dense forests may favor species benefiting from
dense forests, whereas species requiring open
forests may decline or persist at only small
population sizes (Dahms and Geils 1997).
Fragmentation of existing old growth, by wildfire
or other factors, may continue to reduce the area of
interior old growth suitable as habitat for some
species (Tecle and Covington 1991). Developing
old growth, as long as it is not burned by crown fire,
may become increasingly important as habitat for
some wildlife species because it may occupy a much
larger area than current old growth.

POSSIBLE MANAGEMENT AND POLICY
SCENARIOS
Fire Management
Active fire suppression is likely to remain a central
policy in the United States for several decades, both
for social and practical reasons, and especially in
the wildland–urban interface. A need to comply
with 
rigorous 
planning 
requirements 
and
regulations, a societal aversion to fire-created
smoke, and dangerous fuel loads hinder the use of
prescribed fire, particularly if mechanical tree
thinning is not conducted first. Society may need to
weigh the advantages and disadvantages of more
frequent, but less concentrated, episodes of smoke
associated with prescribed burning, compared with
wildfire-induced, intense smoke that can affect
regional air quality even 1000 km away from the
wildfire. Regardless, the increasing size and
severity of wildfires in recent years suggest that fire
suppression is not a sustainable policy.
Prescribed burning is likely to remain a tool, but a
financially costly one, for reducing fuel loads in old-
growth forests. As prescribed fires burn when and
where managers choose, within the “window” of
appropriate weather conditions, managers can meet
the goals of burning particular places at particular
times. But prescribed fires require a substantial
investment in people to ignite the burn and prepare
and secure the control lines. Such financial costs are
often acceptable for forests in the wildland–urban
interface, where the social values at risk from
unplanned wildfire are high. They may not be
acceptable for large, remote forest lands, however.
Wildland fire use (i.e., allowing unplanned ignitions
to burn in certain areas for certain time periods) has
potential, as yet largely unrealized, for restoring fire
to old forests in remote areas at relatively low
financial cost and also with less required
environmental compliance (Dale 2006). Ecological
benefits of these fires may hinge upon fire intensity
remaining low, as the fires will likely be burning
through forests with heavy fuel loads. Both
simulation studies and field examples suggest that
even when surface fires occur less frequently than
they may have in presettlement forests, through time
they are still valuable for maintaining open forest
structure and reducing possibilities for severe
wildfires (Miller and Urban 2000).
Reintroducing fire, whether through prescribed
burning or wildland fire use, will be tricky in most
old-growth or developing old-growth forests
because these forests have not experienced fire in
more than 100 years in most cases (Harrington and
Sackett 1992). These forests are vastly different than
their presettlement counterparts that sustained
frequent surface fires. Examples of trade-offs when
reintroducing fire may include killing some
remaining old trees if fuel loads are too heavy
(Swezy and Agee 1991) and expanding exotic plant
populations resulting from disturbance caused by
fire (Keeley 2006). However, if fuel reduction is not
performed and a stand-replacing wildfire occurs, all
old trees could be killed within a forest and exotic
plant invasion will very likely take place. The effects
of reintroducing fire may depend on fire severity,
season of burning, how frequently fire is introduced
through time, and environmental site conditions
(Brown and Smith 2000, Smith 2000, Certini 2005).
Mechanical Tree Thinning
Converting forests from uneven-aged, patchy, old-
growth trees to even-aged, evenly spaced, high-
density overstories almost certainly ended with the
passage of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act in
2003 (P.L. 108–148). Tree-cutting practices in the
West now, and probably in the future, will focus
primarily on fuel reduction and restoration thinning,
with occasional commercial harvests. Mechanical
tree thinning of young, post-settlement trees often
constitutes the first step in managing current old
growth or facilitating the continued establishment
of developing old growth. Thinning often is needed
before surface fire can be safely reintroduced to old
forests. Recent research has provided dramatic
examples of the benefits of thinning for reducing
fire severity and limiting or preventing crown fire
(Strom and Fulé 2007). Thinning can also change
stand structure favorably for understory vegetation
and other ecosystem components.
Diameter caps, or the upper size limits of trees
allowed to be cut, have the potential to produce
enormous effects on existing old-growth or
developing old-growth forests (Abella et al. 2006).
Many forest thinning projects are currently being
conducted with diameter caps. Diameter caps do not
necessarily protect all old trees, because old trees
can be smaller than the size of the cap. Conversely,
caps can assure that all large (young or old) trees
are not cut during thinning, which may assist the
development of large-tree structure in developing
old growth if the density of residual trees does not

Ecology and Society 12(2): 16
http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol12/iss2/art16/
remain too high (Allen et al. 2002). High residual
densities may slow tree growth and result in
continued old tree mortality due to competition or
insect outbreaks, and also may result in forests that
can still support severe crown fire. Caps can benefit
some ecosystem components, e.g., some wildlife
that benefit from higher tree densities, but may harm
other components such as understory vegetation and
many other wildlife species. The crux of diameter
caps is that they set minimum remaining tree
densities after thinning, whether or not those
densities meet the forest management goals of the
thinning (Abella et al. 2006). There also may be
reason to harvest some large (though not necessarily
old) trees to partly offset costs of expensive fuel-
reduction projects, and potentially also funding
other treatments (e.g., seeding for understory
restoration) that may be critical for restoring
components of old-growth forests other than just
trees.
Thinning of dense post-settlement trees will likely
remain a central management treatment for old
forests, but will pose political, logistical, and
ecological challenges in many areas. There is little
market for small-diameter logs in most western
forest regions (Fiedler et al. 1999), limiting
contractor availability and making thinning
expensive. Developing uses and markets for small
logs may enhance the landscape-scale application
of thinning, but this has been slow in many forest
regions. Mechanized equipment generally needed
to conduct thinning operations at ecologically
meaningful scales also is prohibited in many
wilderness areas and other protected areas that may
contain old forests jeopardized by wildfire (Fulé et
al. 2006). An additional disadvantage of thinning is
that it causes disturbance by road construction and
mechanized equipment, which may facilitate exotic
species invasion (Fornwalt et al. 2003). Despite
these disadvantages, there often is little choice but
to conduct thinning if old growth is to be protected
from eradication by severe fire and if key
components of old-growth ecosystems (e.g., canopy
openings) are to be restored.
CONCLUSION
The prognosis for protecting old growth from severe
wildfire, insect outbreaks, and other damaging
agents may appear grim in frequent-fire, conifer
forests in the West. Given the extreme stresses that
these forests have sustained, however, it could be
argued that it is remarkable that any old-growth
forests have persisted at all, and of these, that their
conditions are as good as they are. Virtually no old-
growth forests remain that resemble those of
presettlement conditions, however, and if current
trends of severe wildfires continue, little of even this
modified old growth will remain in the coming
decades. A realistic appraisal of fuel and climate
suggests that many old, frequent-fire, conifer forests
in the West will burn severely in the coming decades
even as ambitious restoration or fuel-reduction
efforts proceed. However, there is clear evidence
that wildfire severity can be reduced significantly
in even the worst fire weather by tree thinning or
burning treatments. A practical 21st century fire
strategy might position treatments to break up
landscape fuel continuity (Finney 2001), allow
wildland fire use to reduce backcountry fuels where
thinning is too costly or not feasible, and make use
of longer fire intervals and multiple ignition sources.
