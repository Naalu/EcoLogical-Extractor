Broad-scale forest restoration projects are implemented across the western United States to restore seasonally 
dry, frequent-fire-adapted ecosystems to improve ecological function and enhance resilience by increasing 
resistance to crown fire and climatic stressors. Despite the widespread use of restoration treatments that center 
on tree thinning and application of prescribed fire, the longevity of beneficial effects and the robustness of 
outcomes under future climate change predictions remains unclear. In this study, we remeasured a set of 
experimental areas established a minimum of 20 years ago that comprise a network of ponderosa pine (Pinus 
ponderosa) forest restoration study sites in northern Arizona. We analyzed ecological resiliency by evaluating 
forest conditions in terms of resistance to climatic stressors and potential crown fire in units that were thinned 
following evidence-based restoration guidelines (ERG), then burned with prescribed fire at multiple intervals, 
compared against paired untreated controls. Resilience indicators included forest structure, tree mortality, tree 
growth, regeneration, canopy fuels, and crowning index. We also simulated future forest conditions under a 
warming climate scenario (RCP 4.5) with a range of prescribed fire return intervals. Results indicated that 
experimental areas where restoration treatments were implemented remained more resilient to climate stressors 
compared to controls after 20 years. Treated areas had significantly lower tree mortality and greater average 
diameter growth compared to controls. Furthermore, forest structure generally remained similar to historical 
reference conditions in treated units with the exception of increases in ingrowth of sprouting species at the drier 
sites. Canopy fuel load and crown fire hazard in treated units remained significantly lower than controls, indi­
cating that treatments remained effective in reducing crown fire potential over the 20-year study period without 
the need for additional tree thinning. Modeling basal area, crowning index, and the proportion of basal area in 
large trees under a future warming scenario suggested that the treated units underwent less changed than un­
treated areas. Under climate change, management of fire regimes even at longer-than-historical intervals (his­
torical ≈5 yr, tested 5, 10, and 20 yr) would maintain basal area within our historical range of variability and 
maintain fire resistant forest over the next several decades. However, decline by the end of the century is con­
cerning. Our results suggest that forest restoration treatments, guided by historical reference conditions, promote 
ecological resilience in the long-term and continued maintenance burning into the future is likely warranted even 
with continued drought and warming.   
1. Introduction 
Globally, the management of ecosystems face formidable challenges 
to address changing climate, altered disturbance regimes, and un­
certainties about subsequent ecosystem responses with additional 
warming (Johnstone et al., 2016; Seidl et al., 2017; Lenton et al., 2019). 
The southwestern United States is experiencing some of the greatest 
extremes in temperatures and aridity in recent decades (Weiss et al., 
2009; Prein et al., 2016; Mueller et al., 2020). Sustained drought and

disturbances such as large, high-severity fires and insect outbreaks have 
coincided with widespread tree mortality and forest loss (Williams et al., 
2013; Kolb et al., 2016; Singleton et al., 2019). In an attempt to mitigate 
the adverse effects of climate and disturbance regime changes, 
landscape-scale forest restoration projects are being implemented in 
seasonally dry, frequent-fire-adapted forests across public lands in the 
western US. The goals include establishing forest structural character­
istics that improve ecological function and enhance resistance to crown 
fire and climatic stressors (Shultz et al., 2012; USDA, 2012; 2015). 
Despite the widespread use of restoration treatments across the western 
US for the past few decades, questions remain regarding the long-term 
treatment effectiveness and potential increases in resilience to chang­
ing climate. Limited resources for implementing new and maintaining 
existing treatments heighten the need for robust information that can be 
gained from existing long-term empirical data and comparative models. 
Ecological restoration objectives in dry forest types frequently inte­
grate decreasing potential for stand-replacing crown fires and increasing 
resistance to insect and pathogen outbreaks and climatic variability. 
Prescriptions aimed at restoring structure and function of dry ponderosa 
pine (Pinus ponderosa P. Lawson & C. Lawson) forests in the south­
western US are guided by the historical range of variation (HRV; Rey­
nolds et al. 2013) and site-specific reference conditions (Covington and 
Moore, 1994). These historical conditions serve not only as a model for 
initial planning purposes, but also as a baseline to evaluate treatment 
effects (Moore et al. 2004). Restoration objectives are usually met by 
thinning smaller, younger trees, favoring retention of larger-diameter, 
fire-resistant trees and reintroducing frequent, low-severity surface 
fires (Covington et al., 1997; Allen et al., 2002; Ful´e et al., 2012). One 
question of concern is whether restoration treatments based on histori­
cal conditions maintain effectiveness and can they provide resilience to 
shifting climate and changing disturbance regimes (e.g., severe wild­
fire)? Longevity of treatment effects likely depends on treatment in­
tensity, species composition and site productivity (Yocom, 2013). 
Restoration and fuel reduction treatments that initially reduced surface 
and ladder fuels have been shown to diminish over time in the absence 
of subsequent thinning or maintenance burning (Battaglia et al. 2008; 
Hood et al., 2020; Korb et al., 2020). Furthermore, trees may be more 
sensitive to treatment-caused injury following episodes of drought-stress 
(van Mantgem et al., 2013), which may become more frequent in re­
gions with continued warming (Cook et al., 2015). Assessing key 
structural attributes such as basal area, tree density, large/old trees, and 
canopy fuels address some of the legacies and characteristics needed for 
maintaining a sustainable forest (Franklin et al., 2000; Drever et al., 
2006); these attributes have also been identified as key indicators of 
resilience (Waltz et al., 2014; Bryant et al., 2019). Furthermore, 
assessing tree regeneration and the demographics of individual trees (e. 
g., tree mortality and growth) are likely to provide first-order resilience 
responses (Stevens-Rumann et al., 2018; Falk et al., 2019). While there is 
debate about the utility of historical conditions in guiding present and 
future restoration treatments in a new climate envelope (Falk and 
Millar, 2016; Stephens et al. 2018), monitoring changes of key in­
dicators using empirical studies, study networks, and model simulations 
to evaluate ecosystem resilience can inform management options for a 
desired forested ecosystem. 
Resilience parameters are likely to be complex, evolving, and require 
decades or centuries to assess (Angeler and Allen, 2016; Greiner et al. 
2020), but forecasting future forest responses to disturbance such as 
climate is increasingly important. Resilient ecosystems are defined by 
the magnitude of disturbance a system can absorb without undergoing 
significant transformational change (Drever et al. 2006) and can be 
assessed by the degree of change before and after a disturbance (Stan­
dish et al., 2014). Comparison of projected untreated, treated and 
reference forest conditions would provide a basis of departure of resil­
ience (Standish et al., 2014; Keane et al., 2018). Historic forest condi­
tions are presumed to have persisted through numerous past disturbance 
events and multiple centuries of climatic fluctuation (Swetnam et al., 
1999; Allen et al., 2002), meaning that ecosystems maintained structure 
and function after perturbation (Holling, 1973). While future climate 
regimes may make it difficult to manage forests within historical enve­
lopes (Falk et al., 2019), emphasis on expected disturbance magnitude 
(e.g., resilience to warming up to 2.5℃) and when it exceeds resilience 
thresholds (significant transformational change) would be one way to 
evaluate treatment and reference conditions to future climate change. 
In the Southwest, a network of Long-term Ecological Assessment and 
Restoration Network (LEARN) was established in the 1990′s and early 
2000′s to address treatment effectiveness for fire hazard reduction, 
while also assessing key ecosystem dynamics across a variety of forest 
types from pinyon-juniper to ponderosa pine to warm-dry mixed conifer 
(see Ful´e et al., 2002a; Waltz et al., 2003; Hurteau et al., 2010; McGlone 
et al., 2012; Kerhoulas et al. 2013; Roccaforte et al., 2015; Stoddard 
et al. 2015; Huffman et al., 2017; Korb et al., 2020). The LEARN 
experimental sites include recurring frequent fire and now have 20 years 
data from treatments based on site-specific historical conditions. These 
sites provide extensive research on restoring stand structure, species 
composition and ecosystem function, but also provide a rigorous op­
portunity to examine ecological effects of restoration treatments in a 
southwestern ponderosa pine environment under a rapidly changing 
climate. 
Monitoring long-term ecological responses, using site-specific refer­
ence conditions to assess treatment effectiveness and predicting future 
ecosystem responses with climate change scenarios are key elements of 
building ecosystem resiliency in our future forests (Keane et al., 2018) 
and essential in informing the adaptive management process (Allen 
et al., 2011; Halofsky et al., 2018). However, datasets necessary to 
address long-term resiliency are often spatially and temporally limited 
or unavailable. We used this unique network of long-term study sites in 
northern Arizona to revisit individual tree and stand structural re­
sponses. Our objectives in this study were to compare long-term forest 
responses in paired treated and untreated control units across a range of 
ponderosa pine sites to assess characteristics of forest resilience to cli­
matic stressors and potential crown fire. We utilized known reference 
conditions to evaluate long-term restoration treatment effectiveness and 
as potential benchmarks for resilience. We also used a climate-sensitive 
simulation model to predict future outcomes of forest characteristics 
(basal area and proportion of large/old trees) and crowning index for 
each site. Our specific research questions were: (1) Do forest structure, 
tree regeneration, tree mortality, tree diameter growth rate and canopy 
fuels show differences between treated units and untreated controls 10- 
and 20-years following restoration treatments? (2) Do treatments based 
on site-specific reference conditions maintain effectiveness over a 20- 
year period? (3) Are metrics of resilience (tree regeneration, mortality, 
growth, and potential fire hazard) different between treated and un­
treated areas? (4) What are the impacts of anticipated climate scenarios 
regarding resilience of degraded forests (untreated controls), treated 
forests, and reference forest conditions? 
2. Methods 
The LEARN is a region-wide network of study sites located in Arizona 
and Colorado, on the southern portion of the Colorado Plateau. 
Although specific experimental objectives differed slightly between 
sites, each experiment employs the same replicated, before-after- 
control-impact (BACI) study design. Each experiment includes a spe­
cific approach to forest restoration that emphasizes thinning pre­
scriptions that use historical evidence-based restoration guidelines 
(ERG; sensu Tuten et al., 2015) plus prescribed burning paired with an 
untreated control unit (see Field methods, experimental design, and treat­
ments, section below). This method of forests restoration is one of few 
that focus on site-specific reference conditions. Restoring frequent fire to 
dry, frequent-fire-adapted forests is also one of the LEARN objectives. 
Included in this study are two out of four sites that have burned more 
than once (Table 1).

2.1. Study area 
In the present study, we evaluate four experimental sites in pon­
derosa pine dominated forests which had been initially treated 10 and 
20 years prior to our remeasurement in 2019 (Table 1). The sites span a 
precipitation gradient from drier sites at Mt. Trumbull (MT) and 
Grandview (GV) in northwestern Arizona to the moister sites at Fort 
Valley (FV) and Mineral Creek (MC) in the north- and east-central parts 
of the state, respectively (Fig. 1). All sites were affected by livestock 
grazing and fire regime interruption in the late 19th and early 20th 
century (see Table 1 for fire exclusion dates); active fire suppression 
later in the 20th century effectively excluded surface fires until more 
recent fire management policies were enacted (Ful´e et al., 2001; Ful´e 
et al., 2002a; Waltz et al., 2003). Livestock grazing presently occurs 
during summer months at the Mt. Trumbull and Mineral Creek sites. 
2.2. Field methods, experimental design, and treatments 
Twenty 400-m2 (11.28 m radius) fixed-area sampling plots were 
established on a 60-m grid within each treatment unit. Plot centers were 
permanently marked and all trees were tagged and mapped to ensure 
exact relocation for sampling in subsequent years. We collected pre- 
treatment data about one year prior to thinning and subsequently 
remeasured plots approximately, five, ten, and twenty years following 
the first prescribed burn at each site when possible. The MC site was the 
one exception which only had five- and ten-year post-treatment 
remeasurements. We measured overstory trees taller than breast height 
(137 cm) on each plot, including species, condition (living or snag/log 
classes from Thomas et al. 1979), diameter at breast height (DBH), total 
height, and crown base height (CBH). We identified potentially preset­
tlement trees based on size (>40 cm diameter at stump height (DSH), 40 
cm above ground level) or crown form and bark characteristics (White, 
1985; Mast et al., 1999). Trees of other species (oak, locust, pinyon, 
juniper) were identified as potentially presettlement if DBH > 17 cm 
(Ful´e et al., 2002b). We collected increment cores for all presettlement 
trees plus a 10% subsample of all post-settlement trees to determine age 
and reconstruct diameter at the associated fire exclusion date. We 
measured tree regeneration (trees < 137 cm total height) on a 100-m2 
subplot (5.64 m radius) nested within each overstory sampling plot and 
recorded species, condition, and height class (≤40 cm; 40.1–80 cm; 
80.1–137 cm) for each seedling or sprout. 
The same experimental design and treatments were implemented at 
all sites. Although we were unable to utilize several treatment unit pairs 
at some sites (e.g., previous wildfire burned two-unit pairs at MC and 
one-unit pair at GV), 10 control-treated unit pairs were included in this 
study. Treatment units ranged in size from 14 to 16 ha. Treated and 
control units were randomly assigned in all cases. Treated units followed 
a restoration prescription that included both thinning and prescribed 
fire. Tree thinning was based on site-specific historical (pre-fire exclu­
sion) patterns of tree species composition and spatial arrangement using 
principles described by several authors (see Moore et al., 1999; Ful´e 
et al., 2001; Waltz et al., 2003; Tuten et al., 2015). All living ponderosa 
pines as well as other species pre-dating fire exclusion associated with 
Euro-American settlement (based on dendrochronology) were retained. 
In addition, 1.5 to 3 post-settlement trees (i.e., those established after 
fire exclusion) were retained as replacements for each presettlement 
structure (e.g., logs, snags, and stumps from trees established prior to 
fire exclusion). To approximate historical spatial arrangement, 
replacement trees were located within an 18-m radius of the dead 
structure. Retaining about 150–300% of the historical tree density was 
intended to account for the smaller biomass contributed by smaller- 
diameter trees, offset potential errors in the reconstruction process, 
and mitigate unpredicted tree mortality after treatment (Waltz et al., 
2003). Hardwood trees were not slated for thinning. Tree boles were 
mechanically harvested and thinning slash was lopped and scattered or 
piled and burned. Crews raked accumulated forest floor fuels approxi­
mately 30 cm away from boles of large living trees (when possible) to 
minimize cambial girdling (Sackett, 1996) and from large snags and 
stumps to limit consumption and smoke during prescribed fires. Man­
agement agency crews implemented prescribed broadcast burns using 
strip-head fires under moderate weather conditions approximately one 
year following the completion of thinning; subsequent prescribed fires 
were implemented at two of the four sites (Table 1). 
2.3. Laboratory and statistical analyses 
All experimental sites used tree cores and dead wood condition 
assessment to reconstruct historical forest structure (basal area, tree 
density, and diameter distribution by species) that followed procedures 
widely used and tested in ponderosa pine forests in the Southwest (see 
Ful´e et al., 1997; Mast et al., 1999; Huffman et al., 2001; Bakker et al., 
2008; Rodman et al., 2017; Huffman, 2020). We used a reconstruction 
date based on the fire exclusion date for each site, ranging from 1880 to 
1887, because it represented the period of disruption of the historical 
frequent-fire regime and the approximate date of Euro-American set­
tlement in the Southwest (Swetnam and Baisan, 1996; Moore et al., 
1999). The thinning treatment goals were specific to each site, and 
desired forest structure did vary across the 4 sites due to these methods; 
however, our reconstructions provided suitable baselines for evaluating 
resilience of treated, control and site-specific reference conditions to

future climate change predictions. 
We used paired t-tests to compare treatment differences within 5-, 
10-, and 20-years post-treatment in basal area (BA, m2 ha−1), tree 
density (trees ha−1), regeneration (stems ha−1), crown fuel load (CFL, kg 
m−2), canopy bulk density (CBD, kg m−3), lowest quintile canopy base 
height (CBH, m), and crowning index (CI, km h−1). Tree mortality (%) 
and BA growth rates (cm2 yr−1) were calculated as the differences be­
tween year 5 and year 10, and year 10 and year 20 following treatments. 
Treatment comparisons for tree mortality were tested using a paired t- 
test, whereas BA growth rates were tested with one-way analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) with tree diameter (DSH) included as a covariate in 
the model. Treated-control pairs were the experimental unit (n = 10 for 
5- and 10-years post-treatment; n = 8 for 20-years post-treatment due to 
no data at MC). We used the Fire and Fuels Extension of the Central 
Rockies Variant to the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS-FFE; Rebain, 
2015) to estimate CFL and CBD. The lowest quintile values of CBH (m) 
on each plot were used as a model input because “average” stand con­
ditions do not accurately represent the dispersed ladder fuels that allow 
surface fires to transition to crown fires (Ful´e et al., 2001; Ful´e et al., 
2002a). A Shapiro–Wilk test was conducted to assess data normality and 
a Levene’s test was used to assess for equal variance. Tree mortality, BA 
growth, CBD, low quintile CBH, and regeneration data were square root 
transformed to meet assumptions for normality. All treatment compar­
isons were assessed at α = 0.05. 
2.4. Simulation modeling 
We used the Central Rockies Variant of the Climate-Forest Vegeta­
tion Simulator (Climate-FVS; Crookston et al., 2010) for simulating 
future conditions in treated, control and conditions (reference condi­
tions) expected to represent functional and resilient forests (Keane et al. 
2018). Climate-FVS is an extension to the base FVS model, which is a 
deterministic, individual-tree growth model (Dixon, 2013). Climate-FVS 
uses changes in “species viability scores” (Crookston et al., 2010) to 
modify species-specific tree-growth rates, site-index, and mortality rates 
of the base FVS model as a function of climate scenario selection. 
To address the influence of future greenhouse gas emissions, and 
thus consider the effects of anticipated climate change, we incorporated 
the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 scenario (IPCC, 
2014; 2018) currently available in the Central Rockies Variant of the 
Fig. 1. Map showing the four study sites in northern Arizona. The sites span a precipitation gradient from the drier sites at Mt. Trumbull (MT) and Grandview (GV) in 
northwestern Arizona to the wetter sites at Fort Valley (FV) and Mineral Creek (MC) in the north- and east-central areas of the state, respectively.

Climate-Forest Vegetation Simulator (Climate-FVS; Crookston et al., 
2010). The IPCC’s (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) RCP 
scenarios available in Climate-FVS are 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5, which represent 
a range of conditions in which the total radiative forcing (W m−2) in­
crease by that value by year 2100 (Van Vuuren et al., 2011). These 
models estimate a two- to five-fold increase of the pre-industrial con­
centration of CO2 in the atmosphere and project average global tem­
perature increases of 0.8 ◦C to 2.6 ◦C by 2070 or 1.1 ◦C to 4.8 ◦C by the 
end of the century (Van Vuuren et al., 2011). We included only the RCP 
4.5 scenario in all projections (from 2020 to 2090) of all treatment 
scenarios because numerous studies in similar ecosystems have gener­
ally shown that forests were not sustainable or experienced significant 
transformational changes under the higher RCP scenarios and RCP 4.5 
represents a climate scenario that could stay below the tipping point of 
forest loss (Azpeleta Taranc´on et al., 2014; Shive et al., 2014; Bagdon 
and Huang, 2014; Stoddard et al., 2015; Yazzie et al., 2019). This 
simulation period was selected to minimize overpredictions in tree 
growth (Petrova et al., 2014), and to correspond with typical forest 
planning horizons and the modeled bioclimate profiles presented in 
Rehfeldt et al., (2006), on which much of Climate-FVS is based. 
Regeneration events (rates and species) in each scenario were 
simulated when stocking thresholds fell below 40%, and the species and 
their proportion of total regeneration were a function of the species- 
specific viability scores. Total regeneration amounts were based on a 
non-linear interpolation of the observed 10-year post-treatment regen­
eration data for all sites combined. In brief, Climate-FVS viability scores 
were used to determine which species would be established (Crookston 
et al., 2010) and then species-specific proportions of total regeneration 
amounts, the allowable proportion multiplied by the scaled viability 
score of the species with the highest score, were applied. Species with a 
scaled viability score < 0.4 are ignored and a maximum of four species 
are selected from the remaining composition by decreasing viability 
score. As a result, most species established are those suggested by 
Climate-FVS as best suited for the projected climate of the site and their 
corresponding regeneration densities were a function of the predicted 
post-treatment regeneration. We did not consider the effect of species 
migration and assumed a seed source for a given species need not be 
present on site. Lastly, treatment scenarios included three prescribed 
burning intervals: 5, 10, and 20 years, simulations of the site-specific 
reference conditions that included a prescribed burning interval of 10 
years, and a no action control, all under the default settings for the FVS- 
FFE (Rebain, 2010). 
3. Results 
3.1. Forest structure and tree regeneration responses to ERG restoration 
treatments 
Five, ten, and twenty years after treatment implementation, mean 
basal area (BA) and tree density were significantly (p < 0.002) lower in 
treated units compared to controls (Fig. 2a). BA in treated units 5-, 10-, 
and 20-years post treatment was 59%, 57%, and 54% lower, respec­
tively, compared to controls; BA in treated units ranged between 
13.7–16.7 m2 ha−1 compared to 33.1–36.3 m2 ha−1 in controls. By 2019, 
and over the post-treatment study period (year 5 to year 20), BA 
increased 22% in treated units and 10% in controls. Tree density in 
treated units 5-, 10- and 20-years post treatment were 82%, 65% and 
62% lower, respectively, compared to controls; density in treated units 
ranged between 202 and 338 trees ha−1 compared to 882–1021 trees 
ha−1 in controls (Fig. 2b). Tree density in treated units increased 67% 
(136 trees ha−1) from year 5 to year 10 post-treatment, largely due to a 
nearly three-fold increase in sprouting hardwoods within four of the ten 
study units. By 2019, density in treated units averaged 332 trees ha−1, a 
slight reduction (2%) compared to year 10 post-treatment observations. 
Tree density in controls declined by 5% (55 trees ha−1) from year 5 to 
year 10 post-treatment, and by 9% (85 trees ha−1), between year 10 to 
year 20 post-treatment. 
Post-treatment DBH distributions were generally constant in treated 
and control units over time (Fig. 3). In treated units, post-treatment 
conifer diameter distributions remained unimodal with most trees in 
the 20–40 cm DBH classes (Fig. 3, B–D). Hardwood distributions showed 
large increases of trees < 10 cm by 10–20 years post-treatment due to 
ingrowth of sprouting species (Fig. 3, C–D); these increases were mainly 
driven by the Mt. Trumbull site where Gambel oak and New Mexico 
locust are common. In control units, conifer and hardwood distributions 
were reverse-J shaped through time with the majority of trees < 20 cm 
DBH (Fig. 3, E–H). 
Five and ten years after treatment implementation, mean tree 
regeneration in treated units was significantly higher (p = 0.02 and 0.01, 
respectively) than controls (Fig. 4), though treatment differences did not 
continue 20 years post-treatment (p = 0.80). Five, ten, and twenty years 
after treatment implementation, regeneration was composed mainly of 
sprouting hardwood species such as Gambel oak and New Mexico locust 
in both treated units (93%, 90%, 96% of total density, respectively) and 
controls (88%, 92% 74% of total density, respectively). Sprouting

species density increased by 1% and 64%, respectively, in treated and 
control units over the post-treatment study period (5–20 years); aver­
aging 2058 stem ha−1 in treated units and 1269 stems ha−1 in controls in 
2019. Ponderosa pine regeneration averaged 73 seedlings ha−1 (range: 
0–150 seedlings ha−1) in treated units and 428.1 seedlings ha−1 (range: 
20–1315 seedlings ha−1) in controls 20 years following treatment. 
Ponderosa pine regeneration increased by 64% in treated units and 
increased 431% in controls between year 5 and year 20. 
3.2. Tree demographic responses to restoration treatments 
Ten years after treatment implementation, mean tree mortality in 
treated units was not significantly (p = 0.48) different than controls 
(Fig. 5); however, treatment differences (p < 0.002) were evident 20 
years post-treatment (Fig. 5). Over the post-treatment study period (year 
5 to year 20), mean mortality was 2.8–28.6% in treated units compared 
to 6.8–37.3% in controls. Mortality varied by site, with MC having the 
least mortality (5.0%), followed by FV (8.9%), MT (15.5%), and GV 
(16.0%). Ponderosa pine mortality followed similar patterns as all spe­
cies combined with treated units showing consistently lower mortality 
than controls (Fig. 5). By 2019 and over the post-treatment study period, 
pine mortality averaged 2.9% in treated units and 11.7% in controls. 
Mortality was greater from 10 to 20 years post-treatment than from 5 to 
10 years post-treatment in control units (increased by 82%), whereas 
mortality decreased (51%) in treated units between these two time pe­
riods. Over the post-treatment study period, large ponderosa pine 
mortality (>40 cm DBH) averaged 1.4% (0.4 trees ha−1) in treated units 
and 2.6% (1.3 trees ha -1) in controls. 
Ten and twenty years after treatment implementation, mean tree 
growth rate was significantly (p < 0.001) greater in treated units 
compared to controls (Fig. 5). Basal area growth was 3.6 times greater in 
treated units (averaged 18.9 cm2 yr−1) compared to controls (averaged 
5.2 cm2 yr−1) from year 5 to year 10 post-treatment and 3.4 times 
greater from year 10 to year 20 post-treatment (averaged 16.9 cm2 yr- 
1and 4.9 cm2 yr−1 for treated and control units, respectively) (Fig. 5). 
Mean BA growth ranged from 12.1 to 23.4 cm2 yr−1 in treated units and 
2.0 to 6.6 cm2 yr−1 in controls over the post-treatment study period 
(year 5 to year 20). 
3.3. Canopy fuel responses to restoration treatments 
Treatment differences in forest canopy fuel metrics were evident 
through the entire post-treatment study period (Fig. 6). Five, ten, and 
twenty years after treatment implementation, crown fuel load (CFL) and 
canopy bulk density (CBD) were significantly (p < 0.001) lower in 
treated units compared to controls. By 2019, mean CFL was 55% lower 
and mean CBD was 61% lower in treated units than in controls. CBD in 
treated units ranged from 0.015 to 0.066 kg m−3 and controls ranged 
from 0.052 to 0.126 kg m−3. Over the post-treatment study period (year 
5 to year 20), CFL and CBD increased steadily in treated units by 15% 
and 8%, respectively; CFL increased 2% and CBD decreased 4% in 
Fig. 3. Diameter at breast height (DBH) distributions before, and 5-, 10-, and 20-years after evidence-based restoration guidelines (ERG) treatments (thinning plus 
prescribed burning) were implemented (A–D) and in paired controls (E–H) at four sites across northern Arizona. Mean total and conifer density and basal area are 
shown for each treatment and time combination. Bars represent 1 standard error of the mean. Distributions were relatively stable over time except for the smallest 
diameter class in treated units which show large increases due to ingrowth of sprouting hardwood species by 10 years post-treatment. Note y-axis scale differences 
between pre-treatment (panels A and E) vs. post-treatment (all other panels).

controls. Low quintile canopy base height (CBH) was significantly (p <
0.02) higher in treated units compared to controls within each post- 
treatment observation. CBH in treated units 5-, 10-, and 20-years post 
treatment was 2.3 m, 2.0 m, and 1.6 m higher, respectively, than con­
trols. By 2019, CBH in treated units ranged between 1.8 and 10.7 m 
compared to 0.5–10.5 m in controls; five of ten units had CBH < 2 m in 
controls compared to one of 10 treated units. 
Effects of treatments on structure and canopy fuels translated to re­
ductions in potential fire behavior. Significantly higher (p < 0.001) 
windspeeds were required for crown fire spread in treated units 
compared to controls, as shown by values of crowning index (CI), the 
windspeed required to sustain active crown fire (Fig. 6). Treated units 
had CI values ranging from 64 to 209 km hr-1 (average 121 km h−1) 5 
years post-treatment, declining to 57–122 km h−1 (average 113 km h−1) 
by 20-years post-treatment, a decrease of 6%. Control units had CI 
values ranging from 33 to 77 km h−1 (average 52 km h−1) 5-years post- 
treatment, increasing to 33–78 km h−1 (average 58 km h−1) by 20-years 
post-treatment, an increase of 11%. 
3.4. Forest characteristics under simulated climate change 
Modeling simulations of BA (Fig. 7) suggested that the treated units, 
regardless of the burn frequency examined, maintained BA similar to 
reference conditions, albeit all treated sites initially had a slightly higher 
BA and lower CI compared to reference conditions (Fig. 7a, 7b). Pro­
portions of BA in large trees (Fig. 7c) exhibited highly variable initial 
conditions (2020) with FV and MC largely tracking reference conditions 
over the simulation period (2020–2090) and MT and GV showing 
varying trajectories. 
When comparing differences between simulation scenarios, various 
patterns emerged with the lowest BA, highest CI and lowest proportion 
of large trees at the end of the simulation period (2090) at GV and the 
highest BA, lowest CI, and highest proportion of large trees at FV. 
Ponderosa pine remained the dominant species (Fig. S1) with respect to 
BA at all sites and under all treatment scenarios, except for GV where 
simulations suggest that Gambel oak will dominate by 2060. Addition­
ally, thresholds where untreated forest conditions (controls) changed 
substantially were observed at varying times depending on site, with MT 
and GV exhibiting change (e.g., large decreases in BA; Fig. 7a) early in 
the simulation period while FV and MC exhibited changes much later 
(Fig. 7a, 7b). While sites exhibited varying trends in the proportions of 
BA in large trees over time, proportions of large trees generally increased 
at all sites (except for MT) in the beginning of the simulation period and 
were predicted to decrease rapidly by the end (2080–2090). 
4. Discussion 
Forest structure, tree mortality, tree growth, and canopy fuels 
remained different between ERG treatments and untreated controls over 
20 years following thinning and prescribed fire. Furthermore, forest 
structure in treated units remained broadly comparable to southwestern 
ponderosa pine historical conditions prior to widespread fire exclusion 
(Reynolds et al., 2013; Wasserman et al., 2019). For comparisons, 
dendrochronological reconstructions specific to our study sites indicated 
the historical range for BA was between 4.5 and 18.4 m2 ha−1 and 
density was 34–146 trees ha−1 (Table 1). By 20 years post-treatment, 
average BA in restoration treatments fell within HRV and density was 
227% higher than the upper end of HRV; however, this outcome was 
expected because the thinning prescription was designed to retain 
150–300% of the historical ponderosa pine density. In contrast, controls 
reflected degraded conditions with BA 78% greater and density 611% 
greater than HRV conditions. Treated units were initially reduced by 
70–90%, or about 1.5 to 3 times the historical mean density. By 2019, 3 
of 10 units fell within HRV for tree density and 7 of 10 treated units were 
within the historical range for BA. While treatment longevity often de­
pends on the initial cutting intensity, a site’s composition and produc­
tivity will influence long-term treatment effects especially where 
sprouting woody species are evident (Reinhardt et al., 2008; Korb et al., 
2020). For example, substantial tree ingrowth by sprouting hardwood 
species (Gambel oak and New Mexico locust) was evident at the drier 
MT pine-oak site (~3-fold increase of trees in the 10-cm DBH class) and 
the main driver for the increase in average density across all treated 
units over the post-treatment study period. Additional maintenance 
burning was implemented at the Mt. Trumbull site seven years following 
the initial prescribed burn, though rapid growth of sprouting species 
reached tree stature by 20-years post treatment. This response of 
sprouting species reaching tree stature was not evident at the other pine- 
oak site (GV) where additional burn treatments were not implemented. 
This study expands upon the initial structural changes following resto­
ration treatments in numerous studies throughout the Southwest and 
highlights the dynamic tree and regeneration responses following these 
treatments. Although effectiveness of restoration treatments continued 
throughout the study period by providing structural characteristics 
similar to historical forest conditions, several study units, primarily in 
the drier pine-oak sites at the MT site had substantial density increases 
due to ingrowth of sprouting hardwoods.

burns every 5, 10, and 20 years), and site-specific reference conditions (RC) at each site (MT: Mt. Trumbull; GV: Grand Canyon; FV: Fort Valley; and MC: Min­
eral Creek).

While fuel reduction and restoration-based treatments can promote 
ecological resilience to wildfire, drought, and warmer temperatures 
(Stephens et al., 2020), general effects of restoration treatments on 
conifer regeneration are presently unclear. For example, in 2019, we 
found ponderosa pine seedling were present on > 25% of the sample 
plots on 4 of 10 treated units, but only 2 of 7 units (both at MT) with 
more than one prescribed fire entry had similar frequencies (see Table 1 
for sites with>1 fire entry). We found all control units and 8 of 10 
treated units had average ponderosa pine seedling densities thought to 
be sufficient to maintain HRV conditions for a ponderosa pine ecosystem 
(see Mast et al., 1999; 3.6 trees establishing ha−1 decade-1); however, we 
emphasize the need for more research to determine sustainable regen­
eration densities and dynamics on various sites, especially given future 
climate concerns. Several studies have illustrated that under a warmer 
and drier climate, forests are susceptible to shrub type-conversion 
without adequate conifer regeneration, particularly in areas that have 
experienced high-severity wildfires (Azpeleta Taranc´on et al., 2014, 
Stoddard et al., 2015; Flatley and Fule, 2016; Coop et al., 2016; Walker 
et al., 2018). The prolific response of sprouting species following thin­
ning and burning is well documented where sprouting species occur 
across the southwestern US (Harrington, 1985; Ful´e et al., 2005; Haire 
and McGarigal, 2010) and often leads to concerns over conifer regen­
eration failures or potential forest type-conversion (Korb et al., 2020). 
Our results showed that sprouting hardwoods increased primarily 
within the first 5 years after thinning and burning compared to sustained 
increases in control units throughout the post-treatment study period. 
By 2019, we observed 26% and 19% of treated and control plots, 
respectively, that had sprouting hardwood regeneration also had pon­
derosa pine seedlings. Our results showed high temporal and spatial 
variability in ponderosa pine seedling recruitment both within and 
across study sites. Future studies on seedling survivorship across 
different soil types and with regular applications of surface fire are 
necessary to better understand long-term regeneration dynamics. 
Tree demographic responses suggested greater resistance to compe­
tition and density-dependent effects in treated units compared to con­
trols. Although total tree mortality was similar in both treated (6.7%) 
and untreated (6.6%) units from 5 to 10 years after treatment, by 20 
years post-treatment average mortality was 3.6 times greater in controls 
than treated units. Importantly, large-tree mortality was about twice as 
high in controls than in treated units. Large trees are instrumental to 
forest ecosystem resilience but also especially important in providing 
numerous ecosystem services and biological legacies for future stand 
development (Franklin et al., 2008; Kalies, 2014). In addition, average 
tree diameter growth rates were more than three times greater in treated 
units than controls. These differences in stand structure characteristics 
and tree demographics are likely due to reduced competition among 
residual trees and increased resistance of trees to climate stressors 
following thinning. Numerous studies in water-limited ponderosa pine 
forests have reported that reducing tree density increases tree growth 
even during extended drought (Kolb et al., 2007; Hood et al., 2017; 
Crotteau and Keyes, 2020; Low et al., 2020). Skov et al. (2005) showed 
that ERG treatments increased predawn water potential in residual 
ponderosa pine trees compared with trees in unthinned stands when 
available soil water was low. Similarly, Stone et al., (1999) found that 
old (i.e., presettlement-aged) trees responded to thinning by increasing 
canopy growth and uptake of water and nitrogen. Kerhoulas et al., 
(2013) also suggest that growth responses following thinning may be 
more long-lasting in larger trees compared with smaller trees. Feeney 
et al., (1998) concluded that restoration thinning increased resistance of 
presettlement trees to insect attack as indicated by increased resin flow 
and leaf toughness compared with trees in untreated areas. Although we 
did not examine causes of tree mortality, much of the decreases in 
overstory density and BA from 2004 to 2019 in control units were likely 
due to density-dependent factors exacerbated by climate. Several studies 
within the region have documented reduced tree growth (Adams and 
Kolb, 2004; Kane et al., 2014; Kane and Kolb, 2014) and widespread tree 
mortality during the latter 20th and early 21st centuries, driven pri­
marily by warming trends and drought (Allen et al., 2010; Williams 
et al., 2013; Clark et al., 2016; Stoddard et al., 2018). 
ERG-treated sites remained effective in reducing crown fire potential 
and canopy fuels over the 20-year study. Thinning and burning in 
combination have been found to be effective in reducing surface and 
canopy fuels, but effects often start to diminish within 10 years (Mar­
tinson and Omi, 2013). Fuel treatment longevity depends on multiple 
factors, including site productivity and species composition (Yocom, 
2013). To insure treatment longevity by reducing ladder fuels, addi­
tional maintenance burning is often necessary (Battaglia et al., 2008). In 
our study, 2 of 4 sites had multiple prescribed fires within the 20-year 
study period. All treated units had a CI > 88 km h−1, with the excep­
tion of one unit at the MT site which had a post-thinning density higher 
than intended due to operational problems related to difficult accessi­
bility (Waltz et al., 2003), suggesting that those areas are likely to be 
resistant to crown fire because windspeeds > 90 km h−1 seldom occur on 
land even under extreme fire weather conditions (NWCG, 2014). All 
treated units, with the exception of one unit at the MT site, had CBD <
0.05 kg m−3 and > 85% of all sample plots in treated units had CBD <
0.05 kg m−3. CBD of 0.05 kg m−3 is not necessarily a threshold for crown 
fire behavior; however, values < 0.05 kg m−3 have been associated with 
intact relict ponderosa pine forests, HRV and resilience indicators of 
southwestern ponderosa pine forests (Ful´e et al., 2004; Cram et al., 
2006; Roccaforte et al., 2015; Bryant et al., 2019). While CBH differed 
significantly between treatments, high variability between treatment 
units was evident. Treated units at the dry pine-oak site at MT (all units 
had subsequent prescribed fire seven years after initial treatments) 
typically had lower CBH due to ingrowth of small diameter hardwoods 
which could promote crown fire hazard due to additional ladder fuels. 
All simulations of untreated units led to the largest predicted 
decrease in forest density (BA) by the mid- to late-century. Simulations 
also suggest that site specificity (i.e., initial forest structure, composi­
tion) and climate play an import role in determining when reduced 
resilience may occur and the relative degree to which restoration 
treatments can mitigate the anticipated effect of climate (Stephens et al., 
2020). Simulated changes from initial condition in BA, CI, and propor­
tion of BA in large trees suggest that treated units were more resilient to 
disturbance than controls, with reference conditions (RC) potentially 
being the most resilient. Under anticipated climate change (RCP 4.5), 
management of frequent fire regimes at 5-, 10- and 20-year intervals, 
would be suitable in maintaining BA within HRV over the next several 
decades. Historical fire return intervals in the study region were ≈5 
years (Swetnam and Baisan 1996), so the finding that a broader range of 
fire application may be effective gives additional flexibility for man­
agement. While most of the predicted CI values for the three frequent 
fire intervals are well above windspeeds likely to be resistant to crown 
fire, the reduction in the proportion of BA in large trees at both the two 
drier sites (GV and MT) are concerning. Previous modeling results 
within the same geographic regions suggest under future climate sce­
narios, fire intervals should be extended to prevent increasing tree 
mortality ((Diggins, 2010); Flatley and Fule, 2016). Furthermore, 
modeling studies by Diggins et al. (2010) as well as Flatley and Fule 
(2016) predict that fuels will accumulate at a slower rate or even decline 
under anticipated climate conditions, suggesting that a departure from 
historical frequent fire regimes could be advantageous for targeting 
particular ecosystem services or resource benefits (e.g., biodiversity, 
regeneration, carbon). Modeling exercises that incorporate restoration 
treatments which target HRV structural conditions but are more flexible 
in terms of fire regimes could prove useful for future land management 
strategies. 
Limitations associated with the use of climate change scenarios when 
modeling future forest conditions are presented in detail by Shive et al. 
(2014). The purpose of our simulations was not intended to accurately

conditions while exploring the resilience to climate change. In addition, 
simulating future RC and subsequent comparisons to treated units (with 
variable prescribed burning intervals) and controls provide an insightful 
framework as to whether ERG restoration treatments targeting reference 
conditions provide long-term resilience to anticipated climate. Trends 
we found in our analysis were consistent with those reported by Azpe­
leta Taranc´on et al. (2014), Bagdon and Huang (2014), Shive et al. 
(2014), Stoddard et al. (2015), and Yazzie et al. (2019). 
Simulations of the effect of anticipated climate on forest conditions 
suggest that changes in southwestern ponderosa pine-dominated forests 
will be moderate to severe (i.e., large reductions in stand BA and 
changes in species suitability) using Climate-FVS (Azpeleta Taranc´on 
et al., 2014; Shive et al., 2014; Bagdon and Huang, 2014; Stoddard et al., 
2015; Yazzie et al., 2019), and similar results have been reported using 
landscape models like Landis-II (Flatley and Fule, 2016; Hurteau et al., 
2016). Our scenarios demonstrate similar results, albeit with more se­
vere loss of forest BA and large trees resulting in decreased susceptibility 
to uncharacteristic crown fire and slight shifts in species composition 
(Fig. S1); similar results were also suggested by Allen et al., (2015) and 
McDowell et al., (2016). Climate-FVS’s predicted declines in species 
viability scores were consistent with other studies (League and Veblen, 
2006; Shive et al., 2014) but species viability appears to be much worse 
at the GV site and highest at the FV site by the end of the simulation 
period (2090). 
5. Conclusions and management implications 
ERG treatments designed to closely approximate site-specific struc­
tural conditions and reestablish surface fire in southwestern ponderosa 
pine forests generally maintained effectiveness over a 20-year period, 
and comprised several attributes that enhance resilience to future 
drought, warming temperatures, and increasing fire occurrence. Treated 
areas had significantly lower tree mortality and greater diameter growth 
compared to untreated areas during one of the most extensive and severe 
droughts recorded since the 1950s (Weiss et al., 2009) and during one of 
the warmest periods in at least 600 years (Garfin et al., 2013). Although 
sprouting species in the understory increased after thinning and pre­
scribed fire, canopy fuels remained low and CI was significantly higher 
in treated units than controls. Indeed, treated areas at two of the four 
sites proved resistant to actual wildfires that occurred during the study 
period (Roccaforte, 2016). With regards toward ecological resiliency, 
the magnitude of a disturbance has significant ramifications on whether 
a forest maintains its integrity (Drever et al., 2006). Our results indi­
cated that ponderosa pine forests restored to near reference conditions 
are more stable under future climate projections and better to withstand 
warmer, drier conditions without undergoing abrupt transition 
compared with contemporary untreated conditions. Furthermore, both 
our empirical results and simulations with anticipated climate change 
indicate that frequency of prescribed fire does not necessarily need to 
coincide with historical fire regimes in order to maintain resilience. 
Canopy fuels are expected to accumulate at a slower rate under a 
warming climate, so it is feasible for mangers to target longer fire in­
tervals and maintain fire resilience, while potentially allowing sufficient 
opportunities for pine seedlings to establish and retaining large/old 
trees. Longer intervals could reduce obstacles to burning such as smoke 
and funding limitations. These extended fire intervals are likely to be 
especially important in more arid ponderosa pine forest. As new di­
rectives instruct forest managers to plan for ecological resilience, it is 
important to identify ecosystem attributes that are closely associated 
with resistance and rapid recovery following expected types and mag­
nitudes of future disturbance. Restoration-based treatments not only 
provide biological legacies and mobile links (i.e., vigorous seedbearing 
trees, increased understory and pollinator richness, heterogeneous for­
est structure, etc.) needed in maintaining ecological integrity (Drever 
et al., 2006), but also improves logistical conditions for landscape-scale 
restoration goals, which includes treating new areas as well as 
maintaining existing ones with appropriate fire intervals. Finally, in the 
face of climate change, land management will require a delicate balance 
between competing objectives, all of which will require adaptive ap­
proaches grounded in continued monitoring.
