Soil compaction from cut-to-length thinning operations in
young redwood forests in northern California
Kyungrok Hwang, Han-Sup Han, Susan E. Marshall, and Deborah S. Page-Dumroese
Abstract: In northern California, United States, a cut-to-length (CTL) system was recently used for the ﬁrst time to harvest young
redwood (Sequoia sempervirens (Lamb. ex D. Don) Endl.) forests. Landowners and public agencies in this region have been
concerned about the potential negative impacts of CTL on soils during wet-season harvest operations. To determine soil impacts,
we measured changes in soil bulk density (BD) and hydraulic conductivity (HC) after CTL operations in May and August. Soil
samples were collected at two locations (track and center) along forwarder trails and at a reference point at three soil depths (0–5,
10–15, and 20–25 cm), and HC samples were collected only at the 0–5 cm soil depth from the same sample points. We found a
signiﬁcant difference in BD between the reference point and track at 0–5 cm, which decreased as soil depth increased. There was
a negative correlation between initial BD values and percent increase of BD, supporting the fact that the percent increase in BD
was high at the soil surface (25%–30%), but BD did not exceed 1.13 Mg·m–3 at the 0–5 cm depth. However, our HC results were
different from what we expected and were not as consistent as the BD results, as the HC data had much higher variability.
Key words: mechanized system, forwarding trails, slash, inﬁltration rate, bulk density.
Résumé : Dans le nord de la Californie, aux États-Unis, un système de récolte de billes de longueur préétablie (BLPE) a récemment
été utilisé pour la première fois pour récolter les jeunes forêts de séquoia côtier (Sequoia sempervirens (Lamb. ex D. Don) Endl.). Les
propriétaires et les organismes publics dans cette région étaient préoccupés par les impacts négatifs potentiels du système BLPE
sur les sols lors de travaux de récolte réalisés durant la saison humide. Pour déterminer les impacts sur le sol, nous avons mesuré
les changements de densité apparente (DA) et de conductivité hydraulique (CH) du sol après la récolte effectuée durant les mois
de mai et août. Plusieurs séries de trois échantillons ont été prélevées : deux échantillons dans les sentiers de débardage (ornière
et centre) et un troisième servant de point référence, à l’extérieur des sentiers, à trois profondeurs dans le sol (0–5, 10–15 et 20–25 cm).
Aux points de référence, les échantillons utilisés pour mesurer la CH n’ont été prélevés qu’à 0–5 cm dans le sol. Nous avons trouvé une
différence signiﬁcative de DA entre les points de référence et les ornières à 0–5 cm qui diminuait avec la profondeur. Il y avait une
corrélation négative entre les valeurs initiales de DA et le pourcentage d’augmentation de la DA, ce qui valide le fait que le pourcentage
d’augmentation de la DA était élevé à la surface du sol (25–30 %), mais la DA n’a pas dépassé 1,13 Mg·m–3 à 0–5 cm de profondeur.
Cependant, nos résultats de CH étaient différents de ceux qui étaient attendus car ils n’étaient pas aussi cohérents que la DA parce que
les données de CH étaient beaucoup plus variables. [Traduit par la Rédaction]

1. Introduction
Coastal redwood (Sequoia sempervirens (Lamb. ex D. Don) Endl.)
forests extend from central and northern California to southern
coastal Oregon in the United States and are associated with the fog
belt and a sustainable moisture supply. Coastal redwoods have
high-value wood, which has caused an increase in thinning oper-
ations within these forest types (Noss 1999). In addition, cut trees
sprout vigorously and abundantly in a clump after thinning (Cole
1983). Because of the great size of old-growth redwood trees, log-
gers used to harvest trees by using manual felling methods. Over
time, coastal redwood forests have transitioned from old-growth
to younger stands (<25 years old) with high densities. These
changes in stand dynamics have resulted in smaller trees that can
be harvested using mechanized systems; however, sustainable
harvest operations must also maintain site and soil productivity
into the future. One metric of altered productivity from mecha-
nized harvesting is a change in soil physical properties (e.g., soil
compaction and hydraulic conductivity).
We found no studies that evaluate changes in soil physical prop-
erties associated with thinning operations in the coastal redwood
forests. Altered soil physical properties result from trafﬁcking,
which pushes soil aggregates together to increase soil compaction
(Wolkowski and Lowery 2008). Once this occurs, it affects both soil
resilience and forest productivity. Compaction increases soil
strength (Froehlich and McNabb 1984) and reduces air-ﬁlled po-
rosity, resulting in less root growth (Froehlich et al. 1980). Re-
duced inﬁltration by soil compaction also leads to increased
runoff and soil erosion, resulting in reduced nutrient availability
and cycling by soil organisms, less topsoil for tree growth, and loss
of surface organic matter (Lowery et al. 1996; Adams 1998).
The extent, amount, duration, and degree of soil impacts from
harvesting depend on several factors such as soil texture (Heilman
1981; Pierce et al. 1983), moisture content (Coder 2000; Han et al.

2006, 2009), machine passes (Armlovich 1995; McDonald and
Seixas 1997), harvesting system (Lanford and Stokes 1995; Allen
1998; Han et al. 2009), and the amount of woody residue on the soil
surface (McDonald and Seixas 1997; Han et al. 2006). Generally,
coarse-textured soils (e.g., sandy or skeletal) are highly resistant to
compaction compared with ﬁne-textured soils (e.g., silt and clay)
(Williamson and Neilsen 2000). Also, when soil moisture is high,
soils are more prone to the compaction forces of heavy equipment
(Adams and Froehlich 1984). The use of cut-to-length (CTL) harvest
systems has become more widespread. The CTL system is com-
posed of a harvester and forwarder; as the harvester falls and
processes the trees, slash is placed in front of the harvester. The
harvester and forwarder use the same trails, and the slash mat can
signiﬁcantly reduce rutting and soil compaction (McNeel and
Ballard 1992; Han et al. 2009). Han et al. (2006) reported that soil
moisture was a major factor affecting the degree of soil compac-
tion when using CTL harvesting at different levels of moisture
content, and there are models that can predict the amount of soil
compaction associated with CTL and whole-tree (WT) harvesting
systems (Han et al. 2009). These models indicate that the number
of machine passes is positively correlated with soil compaction,
but most of the soil compaction occurred within ﬁve passes.
McDonald and Seixas (1997) noted that there was an interaction
between the amount of residual woody material left after harvest-
ing and soil moisture when determining the severity of soil com-
paction during harvesting. They noted that 20 kg·m–2 of slash on
moist or wet soils limited the severity of soil compaction, but this
was not the same for dry soils.
The type of harvest system can also affect the amount of com-
paction. For example, Han et al. (2009) compared two ground-
based systems (WT and CTL) in the Inland Northwest, United
States, and concluded that CTL systems generated less soil com-
paction (27%–28%) than WT systems (34%–39%) at 7.5 cm soil depth
on ashy silt loam soil. This is because CTL harvest systems gener-
ally impact less land area than WT systems. This is especially
critical because most compaction occurs during skidding or for-
warding operations. For example, a greater land area was im-
pacted when using a skidder as compared with a forwarder system
(Lanford and Stokes 1995).
The use of mechanized harvest operations in forestry has in-
creased rapidly during the last three decades, and CTL harvesting
has recently been introduced to northern California to harvest
coastal redwoods. This system is particularly appropriate for use
on coastal redwoods because it can be used to cut small- to
medium-sized trees (diameter at breast height (DBH; breast height =
1.35 m) of 10–41 cm) (Kellogg et al. 1992) and it simpliﬁes opera-
tions by eliminating the use of a loader (Adebayo et al. 2007). It is
therefore critical to understand the impact of CTL logging on soils
in coastal redwood forests to maintain site and soil productivity.
We designed this study to determine CTL logging impacts on soil
in two harvest units. The goals of our study were to (i) determine
the degree of soil compaction after CTL harvesting on soils with
high soil moisture content and (ii) review the factors that affect
soil compaction.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Site description
The commercial thinning operations were performed in two
harvest units (Fig. 1). Harvesting occurred in the Crannell tract of
the Green Diamond Resource Company forests in northern Cali-
fornia, on roads CR 1200 (41°01=27==N, 124°05=50==W) and CR 1003
(41°01=27==N, 124°05=03==W). The CR 1200 stand was harvested from
January to April, and the CR 1003 stand was harvested from June
to August, using CTL systems. We also analyzed the soil character-
istics by collecting additional soil samples right before each oper-
ation (Table 1). The soil at CR 1200 was primarily silt loam with a
bit of sandy loam and included 12%–14% organic matter, whereas
CR 1003 was mostly covered by loam with some silt loam and
included 12%–17% organic matter. These two stands were origi-
nally selected to provide a range of soil moistures, but CR 1200 and
CR 1003 had mean soil moisture contents of 53% and 45%, respec-
tively, during harvesting, which was not a large enough difference
for comparison. After operation, the moisture contents were re-
duced by 49% and 34% in CR 1200 and CR 1003, respectively. The
CR 1200 unit was 10.1 ha in size, with a 1.2 ha Watercourse and
Lake Protection Zone (WLPZ) at an elevation of 126 m, and had a
relatively ﬂat ground slope (approximately 0%). Detailed informa-
tion on stand characteristics is displayed in Table 2. Redwood was
the most dominant species at CR 1200, followed by red alder (Alnus
rubra Bong.), Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), and
Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carrière). The CR 1003 unit was
12.1 ha in size and had an elevation of 188 m, with slopes ranging
from 0% to 27%. The site was dominated by redwood, as well as red
alder, Sitka spruce, and Douglas-ﬁr. The precipitation during har-
vesting at CR 1200 was 896 mm, whereas the precipitation during
harvesting at CR 1003 was only 17 mm.
On unit CR 1200, the redwood forests were harvested using a
Ponsse Bear harvester (Ponsse, Vieremä, Finland) with a Ponsse H8
harvester head (mass 24 500 kg) to fell, delimb, and buck the trees.
On unit CR 1003, harvesting was done using a Ponsse Ergo har-
vester with a Ponsse H7 harvester head (mass 21 500 kg). Each unit
had a different equipment operator, with the operator at CR 1200
having more than 20 years of experience and the operator at CR
1003 having only 5 years of experience. The forwarding operation
for each unit was performed by the same machine (Ponsse Buffalo)
with the same driver. The mass of the forwarder was 14 150 kg,
and it had a maximum payload of 14 000 kg. The objectives of
thinning were to (i) remove dead trees, (ii) increase tree spacing,
and (iii) reduce fuel continuity. The harvest operators were di-
rected to avoid cutting trees with DBH > 60 cm, maintain at least
60% canopy closure, and retain the healthiest dominant and
codominant trees. The harvester operators were also directed to
use the logging slash to buffer the soil from soil compaction dur-
ing harvest operations.
2.2. Data collection
We collected an initial set of samples to characterize soil phys-
ical properties such as soil texture and moisture content before
harvesting. Soil particle size distribution was determined using a
hydrometer, and soil organic matter was quantiﬁed by conduct-
ing loss on ignition (LOI) at 375 °C for 16 h (Liu and Evett 1984).
After harvesting, we collected measurements of soil bulk den-
sity (BD) and hydraulic conductivity (HC). Soil samples were col-
lected with a slide hammer corer (AMS Inc., American Falls, Idaho,
USA; volume 90.59 cm3). Samples were collected from the depths
of 0–5, 10–15, and 20–25 cm in the mineral soil. Before collecting
soil cores, we removed the logging residues and forest ﬂoor to
locate the top of the mineral soil. BD cores were collected on a
3.6 m transect across the forwarder trail at 150 m intervals. Soil
cores were collected from three locations: in one of the wheel
tracks, at centerline, and 2 m away from outside edge of the track
(reference point) (Fig. 2). We assumed that at the reference point
there were no passes from either harvester or forwarder, indicat-
ing no soil disturbance. A total of 33 transects with 297 samples
were collected in CR 1200, and 31 transects with 279 samples were
collected in CR 1003. Cores were placed in plastic bags for trans-
port from the ﬁeld to the laboratory. In the laboratory, soil sam-
ples were weighed, oven-dried at 105 °C for 24 h, and reweighed to
the nearest 0.01 g.
In addition to the BD cores, a mini-disk inﬁltrometer (Decagon
Devices, Pullman, Wash., USA) with a diameter of 3.1 cm was used
to measure the inﬁltration, with the suction rate adjusted to 2 cm.
The ﬁeld data were collected adjacent to each BD sample point.
Inﬁltration measurement was only performed on the mineral soil
surface. We recorded water volume every 30 s for a total of 300 s.

Based on the mini-disk data, we calculated HC and the cumulative
inﬁltration rate over time using the following equations. The re-
sults were ﬁtted using several functions (Zhang 1997; Decagon
Devices 2013).

Genuchten parameters developed by Carsel and Parrish (1988) for
the silt loam and loam soil in the study area.
After harvesting, we collected forwarder trail width and length
data by walking each trail with a Global Positioning System (GPS)
unit (Garmin Schaffhausen, Switzerland). The width of each trail
was measured every 20 m to determine mean trail width. Width
and total length of the trail were used to determine trail coverage
within each harvest unit. We mapped each trail from the log

landing using ArcGIS 10.4.1 (Esri, Redlands, Calif., USA) to deter-
mine the number of transects needed for soil sampling. This in-
formation was used to determine the relationship between the
number of machine passes and BD and was used instead of count-
ing the number of machine passes manually; as the distance from
the landing site increases, the number of machine passes de-
creases (Han et al. 2009).
2.3. Logging residue determination and statistical analyses
Slash amounts were estimated by the downed woody debris
survey method using the Brown transect method (Brown 1974)
and allometric equations (Jenkins et al. 2004; Kizha and Han 2015).
All logging residues were placed on the trails as harvesting pro-
gressed, and we assumed that 90% of the logging residues from
the thinning operation would be concentrated on the trails based
on visual observation. Our estimates were on a green-ton basis,
and we assumed that logging residues had approximately 50% mois-
ture content and converted from green ton to a mass in kilograms.
Data were analyzed using SPSS 24 (IBM, Armonk, N.Y., USA) and
R (R Development Core Team 2008). We tested for normality using
the Shapiro–Wilk normality test and homogeneity of variance
tests before comparing sampling locations. The analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) test was performed to identify the interaction of BD
in each unit, sampling location, and soil depth, and we compared
the level of soil compaction among the three sampling locations
(track, center, and reference) at each depth using the Kruskal–
Wallis test and Holm’s method for multiple comparisons. Like-
wise, the Kruskal–Wallis test was used to compare the HC among
sampling locations in each unit. All analyses were performed at an
alpha level () of 0.05.
3. Results
3.1. BD comparison
As the interaction of depth × location did not have a signiﬁcant
effect on BD, we herein explore the effects of depth and sampling
location separately (Table 3). For all sample points (track, center,
and reference), we found the lowest BD in the surface mineral soil
(0–5 cm depth). In unit CR 1200, the mean BDs of the reference
points were 0.70, 0.98, and 1.09 Mg·m–3 at soil depths of 0–5,
10–15, and 20–25 cm, respectively (Table 4). At both the 0–5 and
10–15 cm depths, there were signiﬁcant differences between the
track and reference points, but there were no signiﬁcant differ-
ences between the track and center points at these same depths.
At the 20–25 cm depth, there was no signiﬁcant difference among
the three locations. In unit CR 1003, the mean BDs were 0.71, 0.91,
and 0.99 Mg·m–3 for the reference points at depths of 0–5, 10–15,
and 20–25 cm, respectively. At this site, the track had signiﬁcantly
higher BD than both the center and reference points at the 0–5 cm
depth, and there was no signiﬁcant difference between the center
and reference BDs at the 0–5 cm depth. In addition, there were no
signiﬁcant differences between track and center at the 10–15 and
20–25 cm soil depths. The largest increase of BD was detected in
the surface soil: 25.5% in CR 1200 and 30% in CR 1003 (Fig. 3). The
increase in BD decreased with soil depth.
3.2. HC comparison
At the reference point in unit CR 1200, HC was 1.29 cm·h–1,
whereas in unit CR 1003, HC was only 0.38 cm·h–1, but both had
relatively high standard deviations (Table 5). In CR 1200, HC in the
forwarding track was lower than that of the reference point, but
the differences were not signiﬁcant (p = 0.6439). In CR 1003, how-
ever, HC in the track was signiﬁcantly higher than that of the
reference point. In both units, there were no signiﬁcant differ-
ences in HC between the track and center.
4. Discussion
4.1. BD
We detected differences in BD between the wheel track and
reference point in the surface mineral soil (0–5 cm) in both units,
and as soil depth increased, the difference between the two values
decreased. Han et al. (2009) reported similar results when using
CTL systems on ashy loamy soil in the Inland Northwest, showing
that a signiﬁcant difference was detected in the surface mineral
soil, but there were no detectable differences as the soil depth
increased. In a study on sandy loam soils, McNeel and Ballard
(1992) reported that mean preharvest BDs were 0.71, 0.82, and
0.87 Mg·m–3 at soil depths of 10, 20, and 30 cm, respectively, which
increased to 0.85, 0.92, and 0.99 Mg·m–3, respectively, with in-
tense trafﬁc by using a CTL system in a Douglas-ﬁr plantation.
McDonald and Seixas (1997) found that in the mineral soil (0–5 cm
depth), BD was signiﬁcantly greater regardless of slash amount,
but there was no signiﬁcant increase in BD at the 15–20 cm soil
depth on loamy sand with no vegetative cover. They also noted

that the percent increase of BD was highest at the 0–5 cm soil
depth and decreased with soil depth. In our study, there was a
large percent increase of BD in both units (25% for CR 1200 and
30% for CR 1003) at the 0–5 cm soil depth. Han et al. (2009) showed
that when using a CTL system on ashy loamy soil, an increase in
BD of almost 30% was observed at 7.5 cm soil depth. In addition,
pretreatment soil moisture contents at our sites were higher than
those of other studies, ranging from 49% to 58%. Han et al. (2009)
showed that soil moisture is a signiﬁcant factor affecting the soil
compaction in a CTL system by differentiating the levels of mois-
ture content.
The greater increase of BD at the soil surface may be associated
with the low initial BD values. For example, Williamson and
Neilsen (2000) reported that a greater percent increase of BD
was detected on ﬁne-textured soils with low initial BD. In this
study, there was a negative relationship between initial BD and
the percent increase of BD (Fig. 4), similar to the ﬁndings of
Page-Dumroese et al. (2006). Ampoorter et al. (2012) also suggested
that if soil BD before harvesting is higher, then there may be only
a slight increase in BD. A negative correlation between absolute
BD increase and BD before trafﬁc at 10, 20, and 30 cm soil depth in
sand and clay soil was also shown, implying that machine passes
had little effect on soils that were already compacted. In addition,
Han et al. (2009) developed models that enabled them to predict
changes in soil BD with 25%–30% moisture content, which pro-
vides one method for determining soil impacts before logging
operations begin. In this study, we tried to ﬁnd the effect of ma-
chine passes using the distance to the landing, but there were so
many factors, including operating technique, site and stand con-
dition, volume concentration, and distribution, that distance
alone could not capture the relationship between these two vari-
ables.
4.2. HC
Generally, as BD increases, water inﬁltration into the soil pro-
ﬁle decreases because of reduced macropore volume (Jansson and
Johansson 1998; Wolkowski and Lowery 2008; Han et al. 2009). We
found no signiﬁcant differences in HC among the three locations
at CR 1200, and unexpectedly, in-track HC was signiﬁcantly higher
than off-track HC at CR 1003. Greacen and Sands (1980) reported
that compaction may not necessarily alter the volume of micro-
pores, thus the unsaturated HC in our data may be unaffected or
even increased. Although we found signiﬁcant changes in BD be-
tween the compacted and uncompacted areas, the porosities were
likely still high, showing high HC despite machine trafﬁcking.
Rose (1966) suggested that soil HC is strongly affected by pore
geometry complexity and water content, so it is recommended to
conduct soil porosity analysis for more details by separating it
into macro- and microporosities.
Researchers have been interested in how fast soils recover after
increased compaction. This can be a complex question and de-
pends on the degree of compaction, content of soil organic mat-
ter, presence of a freeze–thaw cycle, shrink–swell capacity, root
growth, and movement of belowground fauna (Vanderheyden
1981; Froehlich and McNabb 1984). Page-Dumroese et al. (2006)
indicated that on coarse-textured soils, compaction recovery can
be relatively quick (within 5 years), but on ﬁne-textured soil, re-
covery may take decades to return to predisturbance levels. Pre-
vious logging on our site occurred 30 years ago, and we could
detect a few old skid trails before the current logging operation.
Therefore, we cannot say if compaction recovery had occurred or
if the previous trails were masked by the increasing forest ﬂoor.
Although fast recovery can occur from deep soil proﬁle freezing
(Mace 1971), the northern California coastal redwood zone is more
prone to heavy rains and usually has soil temperatures above 0 °C.
This indicates that any increases in HC from the harvest may not
have been increased. However, we found no data about earth-
worm movement or root growth in this area, which may have also
mitigated compaction or increased porosity.
Although HC is usually used as a method to understand the
impacts of soil compaction, it is less reliable than collecting BD
cores. This is because HC data often have large standard devia-
tions at all sampling locations. Huang et al. (1996) suggested that
the lack of signiﬁcant differences in inﬁltration could be due to
this high spatial variability, but it could also be that we collected
an insufﬁcient sample size. Nielsen et al. (1973) suggested that the
true variation in water movement that exists from place to place
in any area should be examined with a large number of samples.
We estimated HC from 31–33 transects within a 10–12 ha area,
making it difﬁcult to be sure that our HC samples fully explain
each sample location (track, center, and reference) and site vari-
ability.
4.3. Factors affecting soil compaction
CTL harvesting is known to produce a heavy slash mat, which
can inﬂuence the degree and extent of compaction (McNeel and
Ballard 1992; McDonald and Seixas 1997; Han et al. 2006, 2009). In
our study, the equipment operator created large amounts of
logging residues to prevent soil disturbance (Table 6). Usually,
logging residues are weighed to determine the total amount

remaining (Han et al. 2006); however, we had sawlogs and a large
amount of branches, twigs, and stems that we could not ade-
quately weigh. Therefore, we used two methods (allometric equa-
tions and Brown’s method) to determine how much logging
residue was present. On ashy loamy soil, Han et al. (2009) noted
that the degree of soil compaction when using CTL was severe
when the soil was exposed as compared with areas covered in
logging residues. They also noted that the actual amounts of res-
idues were not important, only that the mineral soil was buffered
from direct contact with equipment. Furthermore, McMahon and
Evanson (1994) reported that changing the amounts of logging
residues altered the amount of compaction on loamy sands; they
noted a 16% increase in BD on sites with heavy logging residues
(18.6 kg·m–2), a 21% increase in BD on sites with light logging
residues (9.2 kg·m–2), and a 25% increase in BD on bare ground.
However, the mitigating effects of logging slash can be reduced
depending on the size of the material (McDonald and Seixas 1997;
Han et al. 2006). Han et al. (2006) reported that small-diameter
slash was likely to be crushed, so it could not absorb the tire
pressure. Also, the amount of logging residues was more effective
on wet soil than on dry soil, suggesting an interaction between
moisture content and amounts of logging residues. Plentiful log-
ging residues on wet soils could have minimized the amount of
soil compaction that we found. McDonald and Seixas (1997) also
conﬁrmed that logging residues had a more signiﬁcant effect on
wet soil than dry conditions when using a forwarder, suggesting
that as the moisture content increases, the bearing capacity of the
soil decreases. Thus, the large quantities of logging residues on
the soil surface potentially reduced equipment impacts on the
mineral soil even though our soils were relatively wet.
The amount of organic matter within the mineral soil may also
affect the amount of soil compaction by equipment (Froehlich
and McNabb 1984; Dexter 2004). Ares et al. (2005) suggested that
large areas of forest soils in the Paciﬁc Northwest are covered with
high organic carbon content with relatively low BD, which dis-
tinctly minimizes the impacts on forest site productivity. Coastal
redwood sites in our study had a large amount of soil organic
matter from understory inputs, a large amount of overstory tree
litterfall, and slow decomposition rates associated with cool,
moist climates (Froehlich and McNabb 1984). Williamson and
Neilsen (2000) found a negative relationship between BD and or-
ganic matter, showing high R2 value (0.85) regardless of machine
passes. They also reported that the BDs in wet conditions were
lower than those in dry conditions as machine passes increased
(0.9–1.0 Mg·m–3 versus 1.2–1.4 Mg·m–3), suggesting that the soils in
areas of low rainfall with lower contents of organic matter had the
highest BDs, whereas soils in areas of high rainfall with higher
contents of organic matter had the lowest BDs.
We could not measure the machine characteristics in the ﬁelds
(e.g., ground pressure or equipment speed); however, we noted
that bogie tracks were used with the harvester and forwarder.
Equipment with bogie tracks is used to disperse the load to a
greater area (i.e., to not concentrate it on a small area), which can
be effective for minimizing ground pressure on soil compared
with using conventional wheels (Bygdén et al. 2003; Gerasimov
and Katarov 2010). In a previous study, bogie tracks produced less
soil rutting damage and did not raise the resistance to soil pene-
tration compared with wheel tracks (Bygdén et al. 2003). In addi-
tion, as previously mentioned, there was a logging operation
30 years ago on our site, and the soil might be relatively resistant
to further compaction in each unit. Ampoorter et al. (2012) found
that once the soil was compacted, any soil would be relatively
tolerant to further compaction because of an increase in micro-
pores and a decrease in macropores.
4.4. The extent of compaction on forwarding trails
Compared with WT operations, we could detect the forwarding
trails in CTL operations because of the relative repetitive move-
ment. The center points in unit CR 1200 were compacted, but we
did not ﬁnd similar impacts in unit CR 1003. This is due to equip-
ment trafﬁcking across the centerline of the trail. In unit CR 1200,
18.8% of the unit was in trail systems, with a similar amount
compacted. In unit CR 1003, 16.5% of the area was in trails, but
only 8.3% was compacted, suggesting that the different operators
moved dissimilarly over the forwarding trails (Table 7). McNeel
and Ballard (1992) calculated that the forwarding trails accounted
for 19.7% of the area, and Lanford and Stokes (1995) reported that
38% of the area was disturbed when using a CTL system. Han et al.
(2009) suggested a different calculation that distinguishes be-
tween the centerline and the track. They reported that approxi-
mately 19%–20% of total harvesting unit was covered by trails from
the CTL system; however, the actual compacted area was reduced
by up to 10%.
4.5. Acceptable levels of soil compaction
We found an increase in BD of approximately 25%–30% in the
soil surface (0–5 cm depth), which was an increase in BD from 0.70
and 0.71 g·cm–3 to 0.83 and 0.84 g·cm–3 in CR 1200 and CR 1003,
respectively. Several studies have shown that increasing BD can
limit that the root growth (Daddow and Warrington 1983; Pierce
et al. 1983). Pierce et al. (1983) suggested that the BD values ranging
from 1.39 Mg·m–3 in clay to 1.69 Mg·m–3 in sand and loamy sands
affected root growth. The United States Department of Agricul-
ture (USDA) Forest Service has used a threshold of a 15% increase
in BD to ensure long-term soil productivity in the Paciﬁc North-
west region (Page-Dumroese et al. 2000). Changes in BD on our
sites may not be severe enough to restrict the root growth in silt
loam, loam, and sandy loam, but the increase in BD at some loca-
tions would exceed the threshold of 15%. In addition, Froehlich
(1979) developed a prediction model to describe how increased BD
may alter tree growth and showed that there could be a 6%–12%
reduction in tree growth rate depending on the degree of soil
compaction. He also suggested that if BD increases by more than
10%, there will be a decrease in root growth for residual young
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex P. Lawson & C. Law-
son), but this change may not be great enough to limit ground-
based logging. Compaction caused by a vibratory soil compactor
in plantations of ponderosa pine aged 3–8 years old did not reduce
the tree growth, but soil texture is important when determining
the overall growth reductions (Gomez et al. 2002). Likewise,
Page-Dumroese et al. (2006) found that there is no clear correla-
tion between compaction and future tree growth, as compaction
is related to other soil impacts such as displacement, mixing, and
rutting. They also reported that using a percent increase of BD
could limit activities with low initial BD, and on sites with high

initial BD, the changes in macropores may alter tree growth with-
out causing an increase in BD.
4.6. Best management practices (BMPs) for CTL operations
Powers et al. (1998) suggested that estimations of soil quality
thresholds for a wide range of soils are difﬁcult and that forest
soils are susceptible to disturbance (e.g., compaction and forest
ﬂoor removal). Furthermore, it is difﬁcult to estimate postdistur-
bance recovery time for individual soils. Many studies have exam-
ined the impacts of harvest operations on soil properties and
subsequent stand growth (Ares et al. 2005; Labelle and Jaeger 2011;
Achat et al. 2015) and, in general, WT harvest operations remove
forest residues, resulting in an export of soil nutrients such as
carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, leading to declines
in residual tree growth (Palviainen and Finér 2012; Naghdi et al.
2016).
Unlike WT systems, CTL systems generally require less area to
transport logs and result in fewer impacts on soil physical prop-
erties. CTL systems leave a greater amount of forest residues on-
site to act as a buffer against rutting, compaction, and the mixing
of forest ﬂoor and topsoil (Froehlich et al. 1986; Han et al. 2009;
Labelle and Jaeger 2011; Missanjo and Kamanga-Thole 2014).
There are few soil studies on which to base BMPs for CTL harvest
operations in young-growth redwood stands. However, perform-
ing harvest operations at times when the soil is dry can limit the
severity and extent of soil compaction to ensure adequate growth
of the residual redwood stands. Retaining forest residues can
also maintain soil quality for residual tress or the next rotation
(Ghaffariyan and Apolit 2015). In redwood stands, O’Hara et al.
(2010) noted that because decomposition occurs quickly, it should
be relatively easy to manage forest residues while minimizing ﬁre
danger. Restoration of these stands by silvicultural manipulation
is key to the acquisition of old-growth properties (Keyes and
Teraoka 2014); therefore, understanding the impacts of CTL and
WT harvest operations on soil properties will also help achieve
restoration targets.
5. Conclusions
This is the ﬁrst CTL study on coastal redwoods in northern
California to assess changes in BD and HC on soils with high
moisture content (49%–58%). The actual values of BD on the tracks
were low; however, in both units, there was a high percent in-
crease in BD (25%–30%) on the tracks. HC data showed inconsistent
results because of high spatial variability, so we recommend ana-
lyzing soil porosities for a more detailed analysis by separating
into macro- and microporosities with a greater number of sam-
ples. When we separated the forwarding trails (disturbed versus
undisturbed area) and considered only compacted area, the over-
all compacted area was reduced. Thus, it is recommended that
operators move carefully by using the same trails in the CTL sys-
tem when they drive and avoid crossing the centerline of the
forwarding trails. In northern California, a CTL system would not
detrimentally affect the root growth based on actual values of BD;
however, the percent increases of BD were beyond the standards
set by the USDA Forest Service. The impact depends on site factors
such as species and soil texture, so it is recommended that future
studies examine the long-term impacts from the CTL system on
forest growth.
