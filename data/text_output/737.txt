EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
• 
Ponderosa pine and dry mixed conifer forests in the Southwest have undergone dramatic 
changes in forest structure, function, and composition since about 1870. These alterations 
are attributed to livestock grazing, logging, and fire suppression.   
• 
Impacts of these forest changes include reduced tree vigor, forage quantity and quality, 
nutrient availability, and overall forest health.    
• 
Fire risk has worsened and potential fire behavior has grown more severe due to (1) 
increased tree densities and canopy closure, (2) variability and continuity of vertical 
structure resulting in the presence of ladder fuels, (3) tree mortality due to competition, 
suppression, lack of soil moisture, and disease and insect outbreaks, and (4) increases in 
forest floor fuel loads.   
• 
Effects on watershed processes include increases in evapotranspiration and interception, 
and decreases in infiltration, soil moisture, and surface runoff. 
• 
Alterations due to anthropogenic activities such as these are evident in the Upper Lake 
Mary watershed located in the Coconino National Forest near Flagstaff, Arizona.   
• 
Surface runoff into Upper Lake Mary has decreased even with similar precipitation 
amounts, suggesting that reduced surface flows could be due to expansion of overstory 
vegetation.  These effects, together with extended drought and the risk of catastrophic 
wildfire posed by dense forest conditions, could potentially jeopardize the ability of the 
City of Flagstaff’s reservoir to produce adequate amounts of unpolluted water.  As of 
July 2007, the reservoir was at 13.7% of its capacity.   
 
OBJECTIVES 
 
• 
Determine (1) presettlement and current forest conditions and structure in the Upper Lake 
Mary watershed, (2) current and presettlement surface water flows, and (3) effects of four 
forest management alternatives on surface flows, sedimentation, erosion, and risk of 
catastrophic wildfire. 
• 
Provide the Coconino National Forest and the City of Flagstaff with management 
options, analysis, and results in a form that is directly useable to begin the NEPA process. 
 
FORESTS AND WATER YIELD 
 
• 
The removal of overstory vegetation results in increased water yields, peak flows, and 
low flows (base flows). 
• 
Process changes that account for these increases include (1) reduction of overall 
evapotranspiration, (2) increased soil moisture and infiltration, and (3) decreased 
interception of precipitation by vegetation, especially snow.  
• 
Even though water yield increases may not be statistically detectable, that does not mean 
they are not actually occurring.   
• 
A minimum of 20% of the watershed area must be treated with at least 15% overstory 
removal to achieve augmented streamflows. 
• 
Creation and enlargement of openings is key.  Uniform thinnings are discouraged. 

 
2
• 
Generally, 18-20 inches of annual precipitation are required to produce additional runoff 
through vegetation manipulation.  The Upper Lake Mary watershed has historically 
exceeded this threshold. 
 
ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION 
 
• 
Ecological restoration treatments in ponderosa pine are designed to return forest 
structure, function, and composition to historic reference conditions, including the re-
establishment of a frequent, low-severity fire regime. 
• 
These treatments can counteract the temporal streamflow declines normally associated 
with thinning treatments, and can maintain and renew streamflow response.  
• 
Uncertainty exists with regard to the effects of restoration treatments on snowpack spatial 
arrangement, distribution, and water content.  Since up to 97% of streamflow in Arizona 
watersheds can be accounted for by melting snow, this indicates the need for further 
study in this area.  
 
METHODS 
 
• 
A forest inventory was conducted in the watershed to determine current and presettlement 
forest structure.   
• 
The inventory area was stratified using logical combinations of Terrestrial Ecosystems 
Survey (TES) map units.  This stratification system incorporates (1) soil physical and 
chemical properties, (2) climatic considerations, (3) topographic positions and slope, (4) 
vegetative, anthropogenic, and zootic influences, (5) productive and successional 
potentials, and (6) area geology. 
• 
Water yields were calculated using the Baker-Kovner streamflow regression model 
developed from hydrologic studies in the Beaver Creek experimental watersheds. 
• 
Soil erosion and sedimentation modeling was performed using information from the TES 
and previous studies. 
• 
Water yields, erosion, and sedimentation were modeled for four management scenarios: 
(1) no action, (2) thinning 25% of basal area, (3) thinning 50% of basal area, and (4) 
ecological restoration.  In addition, sedimentation and erosion were modeled for a severe 
wildfire. 
• 
Additional effects of severe wildfire were assessed using GIS data and current literature. 
 
RESULTS 
 
• 
All inventory strata except Strata 1 and 3 are outside the historic range of variability for 
density and canopy cover as expressed by presettlement reference conditions. 
• 
Inventory Strata 4 and 6 exhibit high potential for stand-replacing crown fires.  Stratum 4 
is of special concern, since these areas channel surface runoff from the watershed into 
Upper Lake Mary. 
• 
Strata 6 and 8 have high densities of both live and dead standing trees.  
• 
Water yields have decreased by as much as 29% since about 1870. 
• 
If best management practices are observed, only the severe wildfire scenario will result in 
significant erosion and sedimentation. 

 
3
• 
Other effects of severe wildfire include (1) reduced infiltration and increased erosion due 
to water repellent layers in the soil, (2) increases in dry ravel, slope failures, and debris 
torrents, (3) increases in peak flows that can result in destructive floods, and (4) decreases 
in water quality due to sediment, fire-retardant chemicals, heavy metals, and nitrate 
contamination. 
 
CONCLUSIONS AND MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
• 
No treatments are recommended for Strata 1 and 3. 
• 
Treatment priority should be given to Strata 4, focusing on the slopes of the drainages 
that carry runoff into Upper Lake Mary.  These treatments will provide reduced risk of 
catastrophic wildfire, watershed protection, and have good potential for increased water 
yields.  
• 
Stratum 8 and the areas of 15-40% slope in Stratum 6 should be treated next, with 
attention given to removal of dead standing trees, restoration of aspen stands, and 
elimination of encroaching white fir.  
• 
Enlargement of openings is recommended as a treatment strategy for Strata 2, 5, and 7.  
These areas compose 70% of the watershed area and offer good results in terms of water 
yield augmentation and fire protection.   
• 
Ecological restoration treatments designed to mimic presettlement forest conditions can 
return surface water flows to presettlement levels, and can maintain and renew 
streamflow response to treatment. 
• 
All thinning treatments offer protection from severe wildfires and increases in surface 
flows, with the greatest benefits from restoration treatments. 
• 
Prescribed fire treatments should occur approximately every 5 years in order to maintain 
streamflow response.

INTRODUCTION 
     In the arid landscapes of the southwestern United States, water is perhaps the scarcest and 
most valuable resource.  John Wesley Powell became convinced of water’s vital importance to 
the region during his exploration of the West in 1869, and reported as much to Congress upon his 
return (Reisner 1993).  Powell foresaw the need for reliable supplies of water in the Southwest 
for agricultural purposes and to slake the thirst of an ever-expanding populace; his predictions 
are proving to hold true now more than ever.  The western U.S. is currently the fastest-growing 
region in the country, with Arizona and Nevada leading the nation in population growth rates 
(Bernstein 2006).  Counties and municipal governments in the region are seeing their already 
meager water supplies taxed to the limit and are responding by re-evaluating their water and 
development policies.  Often they are forced to search for additional sources of water to meet 
increasing demand, as in the case of the communities of the Verde River in north-central Arizona 
(Davis 2007). 
     The city of Flagstaff, Arizona is currently facing this very dilemma, which has been 
exacerbated in recent years by drought and by conditions in the surrounding forest.  Flagstaff’s 
population increased by 21.2% between 1990 and 2006 (USCB 2007).  At the same time, the city 
has seen decreasing surface flows into Upper Lake Mary, its sole reservoir, even in years with 
similar precipitation amounts; the lake is currently at 13.7% of its capacity (Jack Rathjen, City of 
Flagstaff Water Production Manager, personal communication, 2007).  This suggests that the 
reduced flow into the lake could be due to increasing overstory vegetation resulting from 
anthropogenic activities.  Flagstaff’s reservoir is located within the broader Lake Mary 
watershed, which also contains Lower Lake Mary, approximately 10 miles southeast of town.  
The watershed lies within the boundaries of the Coconino National Forest.  In 1941, the city 

 
5
obtained a lease from the Coconino N.F. and constructed a dam, creating the reservoir called 
Upper Lake Mary (Blee 1988).  The dam height was increased in 1951, which caused the 
reservoir capacity to double.  Upper Lake Mary has historically provided on  average over 40% 
of Flagstaff’s drinking water, with the remainder from wells and springs (CFUD 2006).  In 
addition to its importance as a vital water supply for the city, the Lake Mary area receives heavy 
recreational use at the lake itself, and within the watershed that provides surface runoff into the 
lake (Desta and Tecle 2004, personal observation).  Of note is the fact that this watershed also 
provides valuable habitat for wildlife, especially migratory birds of prey and waterfowl.  It is 
subject to seasonal closures for this reason (CNF 2007). 
     Like other northern Arizona ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) forests, the 
Upper Lake Mary watershed has undergone dramatic changes in forest structure since settlement 
by Europeans, which began about 1870.  Large, old ponderosa pines have been removed, while 
saplings, seedlings, and poles have multiplied, often forming dense doghair thickets of small-
diameter trees (Covington and Moore 1994).  These changes, which are attributed to livestock 
grazing, logging, and suppression of natural wildfires, have noticeable impacts, such as reduced 
tree vigor, forage quality and quantity, nutrient availability, and overall forest health (Covington 
and Moore 1992, Covington et al. 1997, Allen et al. 2002).  Other effects are increased tree 
densities, variability of vertical structure, fuel loads, risk of catastrophic wildfires, and 
susceptibility to insect and disease outbreaks (Cooper 1960, Covington and Moore 1992, 
Swetnam et al. 1999, Allen et al. 2002, Covington and Moore 1994, Covington et al. 1997).  The 
Lake Mary watershed, like much of northern Arizona, is rated as having above normal fire 
potential for this fire season (SWCC 2007).  In the absence of dramatic alterations in forest 
conditions or precipitation patterns, this rating is unlikely to change in the near future.  The 

 
6
watershed exhibits high risk of crown fires along the canyons and drainages that collect and 
direct runoff into Lake Mary (Sisk et al. 2004).  Changes in forest structure, density, and 
composition such as those described above are associated with alteration of watershed 
hydrological processes.  Evapotranspiration and interception of precipitation are increased, while 
infiltration, soil moisture, and surface runoff are decreased (Bosch and Hewlett 1982, Covington 
et al. 1997, Stanley and Arp 2002, MacDonald and Stednick 2003).  Wildfire that is outside the 
historic (natural) range of variability affects watershed processes to an even greater degree.  
Effects can include increases in dry ravel (downhill movement of soil caused by gravity), surface 
runoff, peak flows, and sedimentation of channels and basins; and reductions in infiltration due 
to hydrophobic soil layers, slope failures, and debris torrents in stream channels (Ice et al. 2004, 
Leao 2005).  Such a disturbance could severely damage watershed function in Upper Lake Mary, 
and perhaps render it compromised or useless as a drinking water source for Flagstaff for a 
number of years. 
 
Objectives 
     The specific objectives of this project are to determine, to the extent possible, (1) the 
presettlement and current forest conditions and structure in the Upper Lake Mary watershed, (2) 
the current and presettlement surface water flows, and (3) the effects of four forest management 
alternatives on surface flows, sedimentation, erosion, and risk of catastrophic wildfire.   The 
study methods are chosen to provide Flagstaff and the Coconino National Forest with 
management options in a form that is directly useable to begin the NEPA process that must be 
completed before treatment can begin. 

 
7
These methods provide the best available estimate when historic data on forest conditions and 
surface flows are not available.  The following three sections (Forests and Water Yield, 
Snowpack, and Ecological Restoration) contain a discussion of the major principles and 
assumptions upon which this report is based. 
 
Forests and Water Yield 
     In this report, the terms water yield, surface flow, surface runoff, and streamflow are 
synonymous and refer to “water that derives from precipitation and flows directly off the land 
surface or through subsurface paths to streams, and to some extent, to ground water aquifers” 
(Hibbert 1979, p. 7).  Peak flows are the highest volumes and rates of flow that occur in a 
watershed or channel, and low flows, or base flows, are flows for perennial streams that 
continuously occur from groundwater discharge (Viessman and Lewis 2003)     
     Since paired catchment (watershed) studies were begun in earnest by the Swiss in 1890 there 
has been much interest in, and disagreement about, the effects of forest cover on watershed 
hydrology, particularly with respect to streamflow response to manipulation of overstory 
vegetation.  Many studies have tackled this issue, and many comprehensive reviews of the topic 
are now available.  It is generally agreed that the removal of forest overstory vegetation results in 
increases in surface flows, peak flows, and low flows (Rich and Thompson 1974, Ffolliott and 
Thorud 1974, Gary 1975, Leaf 1975, Hibbert 1979, Bosch and Hewlett 1982, Baker 1986, Austin 
1999, Stanley and Arp 2002, MacDonald and Stednick 2003, Leao 2005).  Increases in low flows 
are significantly less in terms of overall percentage of pre-treatment flows than increases in peak 
flows, but account for most of the water yield increase due to timber harvest (Austin 1999, 
Chang 2003).  The main point of disagreement with respect to vegetation manipulation and water 

 
8
yield augmentation is the magnitude of the increase.  For pine and eucalypt forest types, Bosch 
and Hewlett (1982) estimated a 1.57 inch (40 mm) increase in water yield for every 10 percent 
reduction in forest cover.  Many studies included in this review were from areas of the United 
States and the world that receive substantially more precipitation than the Southwest.  Water 
yields from treatments in northern Arizona should realistically be expected to be somewhat less.  
Better estimates can be made using results from experimental watersheds in northern Arizona, 
such as those at Beaver Creek.  An analysis of the results from six such watersheds as reported 
by Baker (1986) shows that the average initial streamflow increase in these paired ponderosa 
pine catchments was .40 inches (10.16 mm) per 10% overstory removal, which includes the three 
watersheds treated with strip cuts.  Note that this mean was calculated using results from both 
treatment types applied to these watersheds: “reduction of the forest overstory and creation of 
cleared openings” (Baker 1986, p. 68), which together describe the general nature of ecological 
restoration treatments; these treatments are explained in more detail in a following section.       
     Several factors contribute to the difficulty in detecting water yield increases with forest 
vegetation removal.  Paired catchment studies provide the most significant results, but they are 
few and far between, and are difficult and expensive to locate and design.  In addition, 
uncertainty in streamflow measurement in natural channels (as opposed to small research 
catchments) is probably about 10% (Macdonald and Stednick 2003).   It must be said, however, 
that statistical significance of results and actual flow increases might in fact be two very different 
things.  Ziemer (1986) opines that applying average runoff increase values obtained from small 
watersheds to larger areas overestimates potential water yield.  Stanley and Arp (2002) 
summarize several studies that seem to support this idea, and show no statistically significant 

 
9
increase in water yield even with fairly substantial decreases in forest vegetation.  However, 
MacDonald and Stednick (2003, p. 20) present a convincing argument:       
 
“These limitations in detecting change do not mean that changes in runoff 
won’t occur in larger basins, or that there is no opportunity to alter runoff through 
forest management. Changes in runoff will occur with changes in the forest 
canopy, and a small percentage change imposed on a large area can equate to a 
large amount of water in absolute terms. The difficulty is that we cannot expect to 
measure these changes, so the effect of changes in forest management on runoff at 
larger scales will usually have to be quantified through hydrologic models, and 
presumed to be present even though the changes may not be statistically 
detectable at existing gauging stations.” 
Stanley and Arp (2002) present, in addition to the findings of no water yield increase with forest 
cover reduction mentioned above, an even greater number of study summaries with results that 
support the idea that decreases in forest cover result in increases in water yield, and the vast 
majority of reviews and experiments that have been conducted in this field agrees (Rich and 
Thompson 1974, Ffolliott and Thorud 1974, Gary 1975, Leaf 1975, Hibbert 1979, Bosch and 
Hewlett 1982, Baker 1986, Stanley and Arp 2002, MacDonald and Stednick 2003, Leao 2005).  
An important point is that, in general, a minimum of 20% of the watershed area must be treated 
with 15% removal of the overstory for significant streamflow increases to occur (Bosch and 
Hewlett 1982, Stanley and Arp 2002, MacDonald and Stednick 2003).  It is the creation and 
enlargement of openings that produce additional surface flows; for example, a uniform thinning 
must be applied to 50% of a given area before streamflow increases are observed (Hibbert 1979).  

 
10
   The water budget continuity equation represents the hydrologic theory underlying most 
common methods of streamflow estimation and models the inputs and outputs of the hydrologic 
cycle (Chang 2003, Viessman and Lewis 2003).  A water budget, or water balance, for a 
particular area can be quantified by a simplified form of this equation, which is the basis for all 
hydrologic modeling (Viessman and Lewis 2003): 
P – R – ET – G = ΔS 
 
Where:  
 
 
P = Precipitation  
 
 
R = Surface runoff 
 
 
ET = Evapotranspiration 
 
 
G = Groundwater Flow 
 
 
ΔS = Change in storage (water stored in soil and underground) 
     Water balances for a given watershed are usually accounted for on a yearly basis.  Rearranged 
and ignoring change in storage, since there is little change in soil moisture and groundwater in 
adjacent years in forested areas (MacDonald and Stednick 2003), the equation becomes:  
R = P – ET – G 
Any decrease in evapotranspiration therefore results in increased runoff.  Overstory removal 
results in increased surface flow in the Southwest and in many other parts of the world due in 
large part to the corresponding reduction in evapotranspiration (Hibbert 1979, Baker 1986, 
Bosch and Hewlett 1982, Stanley and Arp 2002).  If evaporation and transpiration are considered 
separately, runoff will increase because there are fewer trees to transpire water, provided there is 
no simultaneous increase in evaporation from soil and other surfaces (MacDonald and Stednick 
2003).  The amount of water that actually evaporates and is transpired (actual evapotranspiration) 

 
11
from plant surfaces is usually less than the potential evapotranspiration for a geographic area; the 
limiting factor is soil moisture (Stanley and Arp 2002, Haque 2003).  Generally, potential 
evapotranspiration is inversely related to precipitation, due to lower amounts of energy available 
for evaporation at higher elevations, higher latitudes, and areas with fewer sunny days (Hibbert 
1979).   
     The theoretical annual precipitation threshold for producing additional runoff from forest 
overstory treatments is 18-20 inches (450-500 mm) (Bosch and Hewlett 1982, MacDonald and 
Stednick 2003).  It is thought that precipitation amounts below this threshold yield little 
additional water even with very intensive and widespread forest treatments within a watershed.  
Significant water yield increases through overstory removal can be observed where annual 
precipitation is greater than 18 inches (450 mm) and annual potential evapotranspiration is 
greater than 15 inches (380 mm), because these conditions promote plant growth and therefore 
increased evapotranspiration (Hibbert 1979).  It makes sense that removal of vigorously growing 
plants, especially overstory trees, under these conditions would greatly reduce evapotranspiration 
and result in increased runoff.  It must be said, however, that the precipitation in northern 
Arizona is highly variable with respect to timing and distribution of both rain and snow, which 
directly affects streamflow timing and amounts (Baker 1986).  One or more late-season winter 
storms could produce heavy snowfall followed by a warm period or by rain-on-snow events.  It 
is certainly conceivable that these scenarios could produce significant surface flows even in 
years where annual precipitation amounts are below the 18 inch (450 mm) threshold.  In fact, 
slight increases have been observed in Arizona drainages where mean annual precipitation 
received is at the lower end of the threshold range, although extensive treatments ranging from 
83% removal for the pinyon-juniper type and 100% chemical control for chaparral were required 

 
12
(Clary et al. 1974, Hibbert 1979, Bosch and Hewlett 1982).  Arizona and the Southwest are 
currently suffering an extended drought, which could result in streamflow deficits larger than any 
increases that could be obtained through forest management activities.  However, offsetting those 
deficits to some degree with even modest streamflow increases is certainly more desirable than 
having no counterweight at all.  Again, it is important to note that a lack of statistically 
significant and detectable increases does not mean that increases are not actually occurring.  
With respect to precipitation, it is also important to note that overstory removal and creation of 
openings result in “progressively larger increases in annual runoff as precipitation increases” 
(MacDonald and Stednick 2003, p. 7).  
 
Snowpack 
     Manipulation of overstory vegetation, in addition to contributing to increased streamflow 
through reduced evapotranspiration, also influences surface runoff timing and amounts through 
its effects on the winter snowpack.  Winter precipitation is responsible for a majority of the 
streamflow throughout the Colorado River Basin, with up to 97% of streamflow accounted for 
by winter precipitation in the Beaver Creek watershed in Arizona (Hibbert 1979, Baker 1986).  
Studies from the 1970’s conducted in Colorado and Arizona indicate that the creation of small 
patchcut openings 2-8 tree heights in diameter or stripcuts was essential for water yield 
improvement (Brown et al. 1974, Rich and Thompson 1974, Gary 1975, Leaf 1975, Baker 1986).  
It was thought that this type of treatment affected the distribution of snow by wind, and that 
interception of snow by the overstory vegetation, while greatly reduced, did not play a crucial 
role in augmented streamflows (Gary 1975, Leaf 1975, Hibbert 1979).  However, more recent 
studies have shown that it is in fact the reduction in interception rates by overstory vegetation 

 
13
that affects snow water equivalent and streamflow, and not the accumulation of snow into 
openings as earlier thought (MacDonald and Stednick 2003).   Snow water equivalent, which is 
the actual amount of water in snowfall and varies spatially and temporally, can account for up to 
60% of total evapotranspiration (Stanley and Arp 2002).  Wind distribution of snow and spatial 
arrangement of vegetation, while less influential than once believed, are still important factors in 
streamflow production.  Most results from early studies in this area remain unchallenged, 
although the size limitation of the created openings to 2-8 tree heights in diameter has been 
shown to be less important than the overall reduction in interception.  Generally, the creation of 
openings results in increased accumulation of snow in the openings, with a corresponding 
decrease in the snowpack in adjacent unharvested areas; these changes can last 30 years or 
longer (Gary 1975, Leaf 1975).  The greater snow accumulation in openings results in reduced 
soil moisture deficit, which carries over from year to year, so that runoff from snowmelt occurs 
earlier in the season (Rich and Thompson 1974, MacDonald and Stednick 2003).  The following 
year, less water is required for soil moisture recharge and more surface water is available 
Stednick and Troendle 2004).  Snowmelt rates in the created and enlarged openings are faster 
than in adjacent untreated stands (Gary 1975, Stanley and Arp 2002).  When combined with the 
greater accumulation of snow in the openings, this means that the snowpack under the forest 
canopy and the snowpack in the openings melt completely at about the same time (Rich and 
Thompson 1974, Leaf 1975, MacDonald and Stednick 2003).                 
     Reductions in overall evapotranspiration and interception rates and changes in snowpack 
distribution are the dominant factors with respect to water yield increases from forest treatments.  
However, the amount and timing of runoff also depends on numerous other factors that influence 
vegetative cover and snowpack characteristics including slope, aspect, and soil properties; and on 

 
14
factors that directly affect timing and magnitude of surface flows such as hydraulic connectivity 
with groundwater, watershed shape, and type, timing, and seasonal distribution of precipitation 
(Ffolliott and Thorud 1974, Gary 1975, Baker 1986, Black 1997, Leao 2005).   
 
Ecological Restoration 
     Ecological restoration is a broad framework of concepts and treatment methods meant to 
restore structure, function, and composition in failing or unhealthy ecosystems.  Restoration 
practitioners consider ecosystems holistically, and attempt to find a point in history that is 
compatible with the evolutionary environment and history in a particular area, and to design 
treatments that are mutually beneficial to ecosystems and humans alike (Moore et al. 1999, 
Friederici 2003a, SERI 2004).  This historical reference point is assumed to be within the natural 
or historic range of variability for the area; the term “reference conditions” refers to both the 
reference point and the range of natural conditions that encompasses it (Fulé et al. 1997, SERI 
2004).  Applying historical knowledge to ecological problems can be a practical and useful 
approach, because it can indicate when current conditions are “highly anomalous” (Swetnam et 
al. 2002), it can serve as a basis for comparison with current conditions, and it can guide 
management approaches and decisions (Fulé et al. 1997, Moore et al. 1999, Allen et al. 2002, 
SERI 2004).   
     The exact replication of presettlement forest structure is not always practical, desirable, nor 
even possible in many ecosystems and areas within ecosystems, in part because many of the 
pathways and processes are poorly understood (Moore et al. 1999, Allen et al. 2002).  The 
southwestern ponderosa pine forests are one exception, due to extensive research focused on 
restoration of this forest type (Allen et al. 2002, Friederici 2003a).  This research has resulted in 

 
15
increased understanding of presettlement forest structure, function, and composition and how 
these have been changed by livestock grazing, fire suppression, and logging practices since the 
arrival of European settlers beginning in the late 1860’s through the beginning of the 20th 
Century (Cline 1976, Swetnam et al. 1999, Pyne 2001).  Dendrochronological and other 
evidence support findings of frequent surface fires prior to the arrival of Europeans, in the range 
of 2-20 years (Covington and Moore 1994b, Fulé et al. 1997, Moore et al. 1999, Swetnam et al. 
1999).  Large, high-intensity, high-severity fires were infrequent to rare; suppression of the 
natural fire regime, coupled with unsustainable land-use practices, resulted in the loss of most of 
the old ponderosa pines and the development of thick, dense stands of small-diameter trees 
(Covington and Moore 1994a, Fulé et al. 1997, Covington et al. 1997, Swetnam et al. 1999).  
These dense pole stands and doghair thickets are strewn across entire landscapes, are prone to 
catastrophic, stand-replacing crown fires outside the natural range of variability, and have 
replaced the small groups of trees and large grassy openings that used to characterize 
southwestern ponderosa pine forests (Cooper 1960, Covington and Moore 1994a, Covington and 
Moore 1994b, Covington et al. 1997, Fulé et al. 1997, Moore et al. 1999, Allen et al. 2002).  As 
noted in the introduction, there are a myriad of other detrimental effects on ecosystem health and 
processes that have resulted from these structural changes.  A primary goal of ecological 
restoration is to reverse these effects.  Ecological restoration treatments in ponderosa pine and 
other Southwestern ecosystems historically adapted to frequent, low-severity wildfires have been 
shown to have numerous positive effects.  Removal of forest overstory and restoration of open, 
park-like stands have resulted in decreased risk of catastrophic fire and improved understory 
abundance and diversity, soil nutrient availability, individual tree vigor and radial growth rates, 
and overall forest health (Covington et al. 1997, Feeney et al. 1998, Stone et al. 1999, Korb and 

 
16
Springer 2003, Friederici 2003b, Selmants et al. 2003, Zimmerman 2003, Fulé et al. 2005, Skov 
et al. 2005).   
     Reference conditions based on presettlement evidence in the ponderosa pine forest type are 
useful because these forests experienced ecological changes on an unprecedented scale following 
settlement (Covington and Moore 1994a, Covington et al. 1997, Swetnam et al. 1999, Moore et 
al. 1999, Allen et al. 2002).  The physical evidence of presettlement forest structure currently 
exists in the forest today in the form of stumps, logs, and old-growth trees (Fulé et al. 1997).  
Earlier evidence has been erased by the surface fires that once swept through on a frequent basis, 
so “structure at the time of settlement is the latest and best estimate of forest structure consistent 
with the evolutionary environment for a particular site” (Moore et al. 1999, p. 1270).  Allen et al. 
(2002) recommend using “local”, site-specific reference conditions in order to determine the 
natural range of variability for proper development of restoration prescriptions.  The use of 
presettlement wood to determine forest structure reference conditions is a widely-accepted 
method that is very site-specific and leads to localized ecological restoration prescriptions.  Site-
specificity in restoration design is important because of the high variability in structure of both 
current and presettlement forests.  Moore et al. (1999) discuss structural and compositional 
variability and the need to account for them when planning restoration activities.  They note as 
an example of this variability that presettlement ponderosa pines typically grew much denser on 
coarse-textured versus fine-textured soils.   
      The changes in overstory density that have occurred over the last century have altered total 
evapotranspiration and other hydrologic processes.  Effects in watersheds that have become 
dense with trees include decreases in streamflows, peak flows, and base flows (Covington et al. 
1997, Allen et al. 2002).  Wildfires outside the natural range of variability resulting from forest 

 
17
structure changes can cause increased erosion, floods, downstream deposition of sediment and 
debris, and the development of impermeable soil layers (hydrophobicity) (Campbell et al. 1977, 
Huffman et al. 2001, Allen et al. 2002, Gottfried et al. 2003, Ice et al. 2004).  Ecological 
restoration treatments can help to reverse these effects, and can counteract the temporal nature of 
forest treatments on hydrologic processes, particularly streamflow, which are known to decline 
with time following treatment due to vegetative regrowth (Baker 1986, MacDonald and Stednick 
2003).  Not only will restoration treatments improve streamflow by reducing evapotranspiration 
and increasing snowmelt rates, they will maintain this response through the re-introduction of 
frequent, low-intensity surface fires.  This fire regime will prevent the regrowth of understory 
species, particularly Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.), that would interfere with the 
streamflow response and cause the increased water yields to disappear after 7-10 years in the 
absence of fire (Baker 1986).  Although it is assumed that ecological restoration in Southwestern 
ponderosa pine would affect the snowpack in such a manner as to positively influence 
streamflow, the effects of the creation of relatively large openings (70-80% of a given area) on 
snow accumulation and distribution by wind are unknown and merit further study.   
     Forest overstory removal results in increased streamflows due to direct effects on 
evapotranspiration, interception, and snow accumulation and distribution.  When implemented as 
part of ecological restoration treatments, forest thinnings can help to reverse the structural, 
functional, and compositional changes that have occurred in southwestern ponderosa pine and 
mixed conifer stands since European settlement.  The City of Flagstaff and the Coconino 
National Forest could potentially realize these benefits in the Upper Lake Mary watershed if a 
minimum of 20% of the watershed area is treated.

METHODS 
Study Area 
     The Upper Lake Mary watershed is located approximately 10 miles (16.1 km) south of 
Flagstaff (Figure 1).  The northern boundary extends along the top of Anderson Mesa, which is 
across Lake Mary Road from the lake itself.  The southern boundary is a line running roughly 
from Coulter Hill southeast to Mormon Mountain (Figure 2).  As delineated by the Coconino 
National Forest, the Upper Lake Mary watershed contains 34,044 acres (13,777.6 ha).  Upper 
Lake Mary lies within a graben, which is a valley formed by a down-dropped block of rock 
bounded by normal faults, or horsts (Blee 1988, Press and Siever 1994).  The two normal faults 
parallel the lake along its length within several hundred feet of its shores.  The Anderson Mesa 
fault, which is north of the lake, is displaced approximately 250 ft. (76.2 m) above the Lake 
Mary graben.  The Lake Mary fault, which is south of the lake, is displaced about 100 ft. (30.5 
m) (Blee 1988, Desta and Tecle 2004).  The lake-capacity is 15,620 acre-feet with a surface area 
of 876 acres (345.5 ha) and an elevation of 6828.5 ft. (2081.3m) at lake-full stage.  Upper Lake 
Mary has relatively high seepage and evaporation losses, due to an arid, low-humidity climate 
and fractured bedrock in the fault zones (Blee 1988).   
     The dominant overstory vegetation in the watershed is ponderosa pine interspersed with 
numerous clumps of Gambel oak and some areas with quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides 
Michx.).  Gambel oak is located throughout the watershed, occurring at all but the very highest 
elevations.  Quaking aspen and mixed conifer stands occur at generally higher elevations in the 
southern part of the watershed, primarily on and near Mormon Mountain.  Mixed conifer species 
in the watershed include white fir (Abies concolor (Gord. and Glend.) Hildebr.), Douglas-fir 
(Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), Rocky Mountain maple (Acer glabrum), ponderosa

pine, Gambel oak, and quaking aspen.  Ground cover consists primarily of native bunch-grasses, 
although exotic, invasive species are present to a limited extent.  Annual precipitation in the 
Upper Lake Mary watershed ranges from 20 - 32 inches annually, with a winter precipitation 
range of 14.5 – 23.3 inches (OCS 1997, PRISM 1997, NRCS 2007).  Surface runoff into Upper 
Lake Mary is intermittent and usually occurs during spring snowmelt or during rain-on-snow 
events; there are no perennial streams in the watershed (Blee 1988).  Inflow to the reservoir 
results from precipitation that falls onto the lake surface, runoff from the slopes of the two 
normal faults, and runoff funneled into the lake by a series of drainages, the largest of which is 
Newman Canyon (Desta and Tecle 2004, Figure 3).  Montmorillonitic soils with a clayey-
skeletal or fine texture comprise 94% of the watershed area (TES 1995).  Soils with this texture, 
particle size, and mineralogy have a sizable clay component and tend to swell rather than 
infiltrate runoff.  These soils belong to hydrologic soil group D, which has the lowest infiltration 
rates and highest surface runoff potential of the four hydrologic soil groups (Mockus 1972, TES 
1995).   
     Knowledge of historical timber harvest records can aid in the determination of presettlement 
forest structure.  Although records of timber volumes extracted are incomplete, the Coconino 
National Forest Supervisor’s Office Timber Sale Atlas contains records of late 19th and early 
20th century harvests in the Upper Lake Mary watershed.  This information was analyzed using 
photographs of the atlas maps (Table 1).  Figure 4 shows an example of one of these photographs 
with selected features highlighted.  Due to its proximity to Flagstaff and railroad lines, as well as  
topographic accessibility, the area was subject to heavy logging characterized by extensive high-
grading between the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Cline 1976, Mike Manthei, Timber Staff, 
Coconino National Forest, personal communication, 2007).  Numerous railroad spurs were

occurred between 1900 and 1924, with limited timber sales continuing through the early 1940’s.  
There have been no timber sales in the watershed since then, and few large-scale management 
activities, inventories, or silvicultural or other data collected and / or archived.  Planimetric 
analysis of the timber atlas maps reveals that 77.7%, or 26,435.4 acres (10,698 ha), of the Upper 
Lake Mary watershed was harvested between 1900 and 1924.  3,152 acres, or 9.3% of the 
watershed area, were cut prior to the establishment of the U.S. Forest Service, and were clearcut 
of all mature timber with no seed trees left.  The remaining areas were high-graded, meaning that 
nearly all merchantable timber was removed without regard for regeneration or how harvesting 
scheme might weaken the local gene pool by removing the healthiest, most vigorous trees (Mike 
Manthei, Timber Staff, Coconino National Forest, personal communication, 2007).  These 
harvesting activities, combined with suppression of natural wildfires, have resulted in conditions 
that are similar to conditions in numerous other stands of ponderosa pine on northern Arizona.  
Overstory density has increased dramatically, shifting from old and large trees to numerous 
younger, smaller, suppressed trees.  However, the Upper Lake Mary watershed still contains 
many openings, parks, and meadows, and the doghair thickets and degree of canopy closure do 
not appear quite as extensive as in some other areas of the Coconino National Forest.  In 
addition, the watershed contains many young Gambel oak clumps, with up to 30% of the canopy 
cover by oak in some areas.  Timber harvests of the type that occurred in the Upper Lake Mary 
watershed impact forest regeneration and successional trajectories following disturbances.  Fulé 
et al. (1997) described conditions similar to those found currently in the watershed, and 
hypothesized that heavy logging eliminated seed sources and prevented the establishment of

Lake Mary watershed.

seedlings even during good seed years.  This could be one reason why there are so many oak 
stems in the Lake Mary area (Fulé et al. 1997, Figure 6). 
 
Forest Inventory 
     A forest inventory was conducted in order to determine, to the extent possible, current and 
presettlement forest densities.  The inventory was conducted using a two-stage list sampling 
design.  This method is appropriate for large areas when it is not possible to collect data in every 
stand, and it is preferred over collecting data at a few points in all stands (Shiver and Borders 
1996).  The inventory area was stratified using Terrestrial Ecosystems Survey (TES) map unit 
combinations.  Randomly located 10-acre (4.05 ha) blocks were allocated to each inventory 
stratum according to the percentage of the watershed within that unit.  The field crew sampled 
3,4, or 5 points within each block depending on the total number of points to be sampled within a 
particular stratum.  A total of 338 points were sampled in 81 randomly located blocks.  Point 
samples of basal area and percent cover were taken at each point, and presettlement evidence 
counts were recorded within a 1/10th acre (0.04 ha) plot at each sample point.  In each plot, the 
number of stumps, stump holes, snags, logs, and live presettlement trees was recorded.  A tally 
was made only if a determination could be made that the base of the presettlement tree, either 
live or dead, was or used to be within the plot.  Stump holes were counted only if an adjacent 
stump was not present.  Live trees were tallied if core samples showed the tree was alive in 1870.  
For trees that were not cored, diameter at breast height (dbh) measurements of greater than 24 
inches (610 mm) for ponderosa pine and 30 inches (762 mm) for white fir or Douglas-fir were 
considered to indicate live presettlement trees.  The 24-inch threshold for ponderosa pine was 
determined from 52 core samples taken in the field on all strata except Strata 1 and 3.  This is an

acceptable method to tally live presettlement trees in a specific area when it is not possible to 
core all yellow pines within the 1/10th acre plots (Charlie Denton, Coordinator, Ecological 
Restoration Institute, Northern Arizona University, personal communication, 2007).  Of the 52 
core samples, eight were of presettlement age but less than 24 inches.  There were no post-
settlement trees greater than 24 inches (610 mm) among the core samples, so this threshold was 
determined to be valid.  The 30-inch (762 mm) threshold for live presettlement white-fir and 
Douglas-fir was similarly determined from 30 core samples taken in the field.  I estimated fuel 
loading from coarse woody debris for the area around each sample point (USDA-FS 1997).  I 
also estimated the relative abundance of ground cover species in the 1/10th acre plot and in the 
surrounding area.  Photographs were taken facing north and south from each plot center (point).           
 
TES Map Units and Combinations 
     The Terrestrial Ecosystems Survey consists of a systematic assessment, classification, and 
mapping of terrestrial ecosystems found in Region 3 (USDA Forest Service Southwestern 
Region) (USDA – FS 1991, TES 1995).  It is an integrated survey and hierarchical with respects 
to classification levels and mapping intensities.  A terrestrial ecosystem represents the combined 
influences of climate, soil, and vegetation; the TES correlates these factors with soil temperature 
and moisture and categorizes them along an environmental gradient (USDA-FS 1991).  Indicator 
plants have been determined for specific climatic regimes, and timing and amount of 
precipitation are also assessed and used to differentiate the gradients.  Interpretations based upon 
TES incorporate (1) soil physical and chemical properties, (2) climatic considerations, (3) 
topographic positions and slope, (4) vegetative, anthropogenic, and zootic influences, (5) 
productive and successional potentials, and (6) geology (TES 1995, USDA-FS 1991).   The 

 
32
Terrestrial Ecosystems Survey therefore forms the initial ecological basis for other types of 
surveys such as this forest inventory.  Initial assessment of the 18 map units present in the Upper 
Lake Mary watershed indicated that many of the map units had similar characteristics and 
properties that would cause them to respond similarly to disturbances (fire) or management 
activities (thinning or restoration).  In order to simplify the analysis, like map units were grouped 
into logical combinations (Table 2, Figure 7).   
 
Water Yield Calculations 
     Water yield estimates were calculated using the Baker-Kovner streamflow regression model.  
This model was developed from observations made in 12 of the experimental watersheds at 
Beaver Creek (Brown 1974), which is located approximately 20 miles (32 km) south of the 
Upper Lake Mary watershed.  An initial model used precipitation, insolation (solar radiation, 
expressed as a decimal fraction), trees per acre, basal area, soil, and geology as parameters.  
Since not all variables were independent, the regression was later modified.  It was determined 
that of all the variables considered, winter precipitation (October – April), potential insolation, 
timber density as described by basal area, and the interactions between these parameters 
correlated best with annual streamflow (R2 = 0.69).  The regression equation is of the form:  
S = −5.72 + 0.83P + 0.42R − 0.24RP0.92 − 0.007P2 [1 – exp – (B/45)]3 
 
 
Where: 
 
 
 
S = Annual streamflow in inches 
 
 
 
P = Winter precipitation in inches 
 
 
 
R = Insolation expressed as a decimal fraction 
 
 
 
B = Basal area in ft2/acre

     Insolation was indexed at 0.7 for all water yield estimates in this analysis, which is the 
estimated average potential insolation for Beaver Creek and for most of northern Arizona’s 
ponderosa pine forests (Brown 1974, Dave Brewer, Program Coordinator, Ecological 
Restoration Institute, Northern Arizona University, personal communication, 2007).  Average 
annual precipitation and winter precipitation values were determined for each map unit 
combination and for the entire watershed using an online GIS precipitation tool provided by 
Oregon State University’s PRISM Group (OCS 1997, PRISM 1997).  Annual and winter 
precipitation values were calculated according to the percentage of the watershed in each 
precipitation class in order to assess the accuracy of the estimation methods.  Precipitation class 
midpoints were used to prepare estimates.  Winter precipitation values were quantified by month, 
then weighted by the total area in each precipitation class.   
     Basal area for four management alternatives was calculated for each map unit from the 
inventory results.  The management alternatives were selected to provide a range of options and 
for comparison of water yield results.  The first alternative is no action, or leaving the watershed 
forest in its current condition.  Thinning of the forest overstory to 75% of current basal area 
(25% thin) and 50% of current basal area (50% thin) are the second and third alternatives.  The 
fourth option is ecological restoration, which includes re-introduction of the natural fire regime.  
Ecological restoration treatments are based on presettlement evidence, so the percentage of basal 
area removed for each stratum differs.   Restoration basal area is assumed to be the same as 
presettlement basal area, which was estimated for each stratum using inventory results and 
results from previous studies at Camp Navajo west of Flagstaff, Mt. Trumbull on the Arizona 
Strip north of the Grand Canyon, and from various permanent plots in the Coconino National 

 
36
Forest (Fulé et al. 1997, Waltz et al. 2004, Moore et al. 2004).  Diameter distributions from these 
studies were standardized and averaged in 4-inch (101.6 mm) classes1.  The resulting average  
diameter distribution was then applied to the number of presettlement trees per acre measured for 
each stratum.  I calculated individual tree basal area for the midpoint of each diameter class, 
multiplied this figure by the number of trees in that class, then summed the resulting basal areas 
for each diameter class for each map unit combination.  Current basal area and presettlement 
trees per acre measurements and presettlement basal area calculations were compared to the 
results from previous studies; all values were within the ranges presented therein (Covington and 
Moore 1994a, Covington et al. 1997, Fulé et al. 1997, Waltz et al. 2004, Moore et al. 2004).  
Water yields were calculated and compared for each map unit combination using the Baker-
Kovner streamflow regression model.  Although developed for ponderosa pine, it was assumed 
this model would also be acceptable for the mixed conifer type.  The Baker-Kovner streamflow 
regression should underestimate water yields in mixed conifer stands, since these stands receive 
more precipitation and produce greater water yields per acre than ponderosa pine (Rich and 
Thompson 1974, Ffolliott and Thorud 1974, Leaf 1975, Hibbert 1979).  I compared surface 
flows for current conditions (no action) and each of the 3 remaining action alternatives.  
Presettlement and restored basal areas were considered to be the same for purposes of 
comparison.  
 
Sedimentation and Erosion Modeling 
     Current, potential, and tolerance soil losses in each stratum were determined based on current

Northern Arizona University. 

 
37
ground cover conditions as described in the TES.  Weighted averages for each soil loss were  
calculated according to the percentage of total stratum area occupied by each original TES map 
unit and the percentage of total watershed area occupied by each inventory stratum.  The amount 
of bare soil in each stratum due directly to erosional and operational effects of the three active 
management alternatives was estimated using a combination of results from previous studies 
(Rice et al. 1972, Rich and Thompson 1974, Rice et al. 2004), soil information from the TES, 
and observations made in the field about the likely sizes and positions of landings, skid trails, 
and roads.  Bare soil values in acres for each stratum and management alternative were 
multiplied by the potential soil loss tolerance provided in the TES.  The remainder of the area for 
each alternative in each stratum was multiplied by the TES current soil loss tolerance.  Erosion 
and sediment values were averaged over ten years.  Annual soil loss in each stratum was 
determined by adding the potential soil loss values for two years to the current soil loss 
tolerances for eight years, then dividing by ten to obtain yearly values.     
     In the modeling of soil erosion and sedimentation the following assumptions were made: 
• 
A 25% thin would expose bare mineral soil on 5% of the area, 50% thin would expose 
15%, and ecological restoration 25% (Rice et al. 1972). 
• 
Sediment delivery ratios of (1) 1% under current conditions, (2) 2% for 25% thinning 
treatments, (3) 3% for 50% thinning treatments, (4) 4% for ecological restoration, and (5) 
10% under a wildfire scenario (Greg Kuyumjian, Hydrologist, Santa Fe National Forest 
personal communication, 2007).  
• 
With respect to wildfire all strata except 1 and 3 are projected to have a high potential for 
severe overstory removal.  The existing basal areas are beyond the historic range of 
variability with respect to density and canopy closure, and, although there are numerous 

 
38
large and small openings, continuous stands can still be found throughout the watershed.  
The only exceptions are a few large upland benches dominated by Strata 5 and 7.   
• 
The projected soil erosion at potential soil loss, tolerance soil loss and current soil loss for 
a stratum is a weighted average.  Therefore the TES map unit that dominates the strata 
will have the most influence on the overall erosion rate.  The increased soil erosion will 
also be a weighted average and will occur for 2 years after which time it will decrease to 
current levels (Rice et al. 1972).   
• 
Proper application of best management practices will reduce soil erosion back to 
pretreatment levels within 2 years.  Rice et al. (1972) noted several impacts on erosion 
including: (1) compared to road construction the logging operation usually results in 
minor erosion, (2) in the majority of operations most of the area is left undisturbed, (3) 
seldom is more that 30 percent of the bare soil exposed, and (4) surface erosion that does 
occur comes from localized areas. 
• 
In the modeling of wildfire, where basal areas are high I project 30 percent will burn hot 
(all litter and overstory removed), 20 percent moderate (some litter and overstory 
remaining), and the remaining 50 percent light or none.  These assumptions are based on 
(1) analysis of the inventory data for each stratum, and (2) examination and comparison 
of topographic, fire risk, density, canopy cover, and strata location maps for the Upper 
Lake Mary watershed.     
• 
With respect to erosion rate and wildfire, the potential soil loss will relate to a severe fire, 
tolerance soil loss to a moderate fire, and current soil loss to a light burn.  This will run 
for 2 years and then fall back to pre-burn levels. 

 
39
• 
This is a relative index of soil erosion and not an absolute.  The further from the TES 
parameters, the more unlikely the number is correct.  For example, if the average slope 
was found to be 3% within a map unit, the model will not fit as well for areas that are on 
10% slope. 
 
Wildfire Risk and Effects 
     The risk and effects of wildfires outside the historical range of variability in the Upper Lake 
Mary watershed were assessed using maps created using data from ForestERA (Sisk et al. 2004) 
that show potential fire behavior, current basal areas, and percent canopy cover.  These maps 
were compared to USGS quadrangle maps to determine potential fire behavior in different areas 
of the watershed.  General effects of severe wildfires on hydrology, particularly in the 
southwestern United States, that are likely to also occur in the Upper Lake Mary watershed were 
assessed by reviewing current literature on the topic. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Forest Inventory 
     The overstory structure sample design (basal area, presettlement evidence) was chosen for 
maximum efficiency.  It does not provide information on contemporary diameter or age 
distributions, nor does the inventory design account for spatial distribution of presettlement trees.  
However, basal area is a logical and objective measure of stand density, and it is the basis for 
many silvicultural prescriptions (Avery and Burkhart 1994).  Inventory results by stratum can be 
found in Tables 3-7.  A comparison of strata results from Tables 3, 4, and 5 shows that current

basal area is more than double presettlement basal area in all map unit combinations.  All strata 
are outside the range of natural variability as expressed by presettlement reference conditions.  
Strata 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are also outside the range of natural variability for canopy cover.  
Canopy cover in Arizona’s ponderosa pine forests was historically about 20% on similar soils 
(Covington and Moore 1994a, Covington et al. 1997).  Strata 2 and 4 are particularly striking, 
with basal area increases of 900% and 700%, respectively (Table 5).  Stratum 1, which contains 
parks, grasslands, and meadows, was historically open, with 18 trees per acre and basal area of 
27.9 ft2/acre (6.4 m2/ha) (Table 5).  In the contemporary watershed forest, this stratum has 62.7 
ft2/acre (14.4 m2/ha), indicating that tree encroachment into meadows has occurred.  No 
presettlement Gambel oak stumps were found in this stratum, or indeed within the entire 
inventory area.  However, oak now accounts for 1/3 of the basal area in Stratum 1 (Table 3).  
Stratum 4 is at very high risk of catastrophic wildfire. This stratum had similar presettlement 
overstory density to Stratum 1, but now has a basal area of 203.5 ft2/acre (46.7 m2/ ha) and 73% 
canopy cover, the highest among all strata (Tables 5 and 6).  Coarse woody debris is also higher 
in this map unit combination than in any other ponderosa pine stratum.  This stratum, a portion 
of which occurs on the slopes of the canyons draining the watershed into Upper Lake Mary, 
historically had the lowest overstory density of the forested ponderosa pine strata, possibly due 
to increased fire intensity and frequency related to its topographic position.  This stratum is 
located where active crown fires are likely to occur (Figures 7 and 8).  If a fire occurs on one or 
more of the ephemeral drainages feeding Upper Lake Mary, severe reduction in water quality is 
likely to result.  Stratum 3 had the lowest current and presettlement basal areas (Table 5).  This 
stratum was most likely open grassland with scattered large pinyon pine (Pinus edulis Engelm.) 
and juniper (Juniperus spp.).  The TES categorized it as a chained area, meaning that trees were

pushed or pulled from the ground with bulldozers, pairs of which often ran parallel with a heavy 
chain between.  The purpose was to create livestock forage, although it was of limited benefit in 
this regard.  The mixed conifer strata (6 and 8) show marked differences between current and 
presettlement basal areas (Table 5).  In addition, they were the only strata to have greater than 
one snag (dead standing tree) per plot (Table 7).  Although dead standing trees were not located 
in every plot in these strata, certain areas within these strata are at high risk for catastrophic 
wildfire.  These areas have extremely high densities of both live and dead standing trees, and 
most of the strata area shows relatively high levels of coarse woody debris (Figure 9). 
     Basal area and percent canopy cover maps produced using data from Northern Arizona 
University’s ForestERA laboratory generally agree with these findings, although the data are low 
resolution (90m or 2 pixels per acre) and tend to underestimate both parameters (Figure 10).  In 
most cases, inventory data standard deviations are high, indicating the data were highly variable.  
This could be due in part to sampling error introduced in the stratification process, as previously 
discussed.  However, it is my opinion that the steps taken to stratify the watershed for inventory 
actually reduced sampling error and that the high variability in the data is due to the fact that 
forest conditions in the watershed are highly variable.  This variability in forest structure was 
observed during inventory data collection within 10-acre (4.1 ha) experimental blocks and often 
even within the 1/10th acre plots.  Strata 5 and 7, which contain most of the watershed area, 
exhibit this characteristic variability (Figure 11).  Although basal areas in each of these two strata 
are relatively high, canopy cover ranges only between 55 and 60 percent.   
     Because of high variability in forest structure within relatively small areas, some of the 
ecological effects of doghair thickets and dense pole stands could be easily observed (Figure 12).  
When compared with adjacent openings, stands of doghair thickets had much deeper litter and

     Figure 10.  Basal area and percent canopy cover maps of the Upper Lake Mary watershed, created from 
Forest ERA data (Sisk et al. 2004).  These data show that 38% of the watershed has basal areas greater than 87 
ft2/acre (20 m2/ha), and 18% has canopy cover greater than 60%.   The data are low-resolution (90m or 2 
pixels/acre) and forest inventory results indicate that they tend to underestimate both basal area and percent 
cover.  The maps show that basal areas and canopy cover are highest in the drainages that carry water into Upper 
Lake Mary and in the areas of higher elevation in the southern portions of the watershed.  These results are 
consistent with inventory findings.

duff on the forest floor.  This fact, combined with low levels of light penetration, undoubtedly 
contributes to the marked declines in herbage production observed within thickets.  Trees within 
thickets were mostly suppressed and often snow-bent, and thickets contained most of the coarse 
woody debris less than 20 inches (508 mm) in diameter that was observed in the watershed.  
Forest floor fuels of this size burn faster than similar amounts of larger fuels, contain less 
moisture, and can carry wildfires quicker and farther.  Native grasses are abundant in the 
watershed, except within doghair thickets.  The presence of exotic invasive species and forest 
pathogens was judged to be minimal and confined to a few areas.  Quaking aspen decline was 
observed in Stratum 8 (Figure 13).  Aspen stands are being replaced by ponderosa pine, with a 
white fir understory.  White fir encroachment is heavy within Strata 6 and 8, and is present to a 
more limited extent in Strata 2, 5, and 7.        
      
TES Map Units and Combinations 
     The use of TES map units as forest inventory strata is a method that provides numerous 
advantages over traditional forest stratification techniques based on overstory vegetative 
characteristics alone.  The map units can be used to plan and evaluate land management activities 
based on the limitations and potentials of ecosystem components (TES 1995).  It is reasonable to 
assume that vegetation will be similar within map units because they are classified according to 
ecological factors that affect things like vegetation type, structure, and density.  The map unit 
combinations used as the basis for forest inventory stratification in this study were delineated 
based on similar ecological conditions and gradients.  I considered these ecological 
classifications when creating the combinations; TES map units were combined based on 
vegetation characteristics, slope, production capability, erosion potential, and soil classification.

watershed.  All aspen in these two photographs are dead, and there is very little 
regeneration. 

 
54
Soil erosion and sedimentation modeling was performed using TES information and inventory 
results for the different map unit combinations or strata.   
      Although forest inventory stratification based on TES map units or map unit combinations 
can provide more information than stratification based on vegetative characteristics alone, there 
are certain limitations.  This stratification system could introduce sampling error, because stands 
sampled are not representative of other stands within that map unit or combination (Shiver and 
Borders 1996).  However, I felt that with such a large number of original TES map units, 
combining units that were similar with respect to slope, vegetative characteristics, and soil 
physical properties would reduce the overall number of samples required without introducing 
significant error.  Clary et al. (1966), in a study conducted in the Beaver Creek Watershed, 
determined that if two or more soil types are arranged in a pattern related to the shape of the land 
surface and the nature of the soil materials that the standard error of herbage production and 
timber site index can be reduced.  This study reported that the standard error for herbage 
production and timber site index declined by 43 percent and 30 percent, respectively.  However, 
the authors did make note that the reduction in standard error for the area depends on the 
distribution or weighting of the strata.  If one or two strata dominate, which was the case in this 
study, then the actual reduction in standard error will be less than obtained in the sample. 
 
Changes in Water Yield 
     Average winter precipitation weighted by percent of total area within each precipitation class 
for the entire Upper Lake Mary watershed was estimated at 26.14 inches (664 mm).  Average 
winter precipitation weighted by percent of total area within each stratum was estimated at 25.93 
inches (658.6 mm).  Further estimates based on strata results were therefore assumed to be valid.  

 
55
The watershed receives 18.9 inches (480.1 mm), or 72.9%, of its precipitation in the winter 
months (Table 8).  This is contrasted with the Beaver Creek experimental watersheds, which 
receive 67.5% of total precipitation in the winter months.  The model used to calculate water 
yields was developed from Beaver Creek data, which illustrates one limitation of this analysis. 
     Figure 14 shows, for each stratum, water yield changes at average winter precipitation 
resulting from the four management alternatives.  Current basal area is low in Stratum 1 and 
reflects tree encroachment into parks and meadows.  Stratum 3 has very little current basal area.  
Water yields in strata 1 and 3 would therefore be little changed following treatment.  Strata 2, 4, 
5, 6, 7, and 8 offer the best opportunities for water yield increases through vegetation 
management.  Increases in water yield at average winter precipitation range from 3%-6.6% for 
25% reduction in basal area, 10.5%-19% for 50% reduction, and 17%-28.9% for ecological 
restoration.  Figure 15 shows water yield changes that would occur following treatment for a 
range of winter precipitation values.  As precipitation and thinning intensity increase, water yield 
increases resulting from treatments become progressively larger.  Acre-feet of surface flows 
resulting from treatments for each stratum are found in Figure 16.  Ecological restoration 
treatments yield the best results in terms of increased water yield across all map unit 
combinations, except Strata 3, where minimal increases are predicted for all management 
alternatives.  Vegetative regrowth following the 25% and 50% thinning treatments will reduce 
streamflow response over time and cause it to return to pre-treatment levels within about 10 
years (Baker 1986).  Re-introduction of the natural fire regime as a component of restoration 
treatments will prevent such rapid regrowth of the understory and extend streamflow response, 
possibly indefinitely.                      

 
56
     Although it was not modeled or quantified for this report, groundwater recharge will most 
likely occur from forest treatments.  Upper Lake Mary lies in a fault zone of fractured bedrock 
and is subject to seepage losses.  Hydraulic connectivity between the surface waters of the lake 
and the underlying aquifer probably exists, as evidenced by water quality tests conducted by the 
City of Flagstaff.  Test results show that surface water from the lake and water from one of the 
city’s wells in the Lake Mary Well-field are virtually indistinguishable from one another (Ron 
Doba, Utilities Director, City of Flagstaff, personal communication, 2007). 
 
Sedimentation and Erosion Modeling 
     The Upper Lake Mary watershed, like the Beaver Creek study conducted by Clary et al. 
(1966), is dominated by a few strata.  Strata 4, 5, and 7 are comprised of nine TES map units and 
represent 28,445 acres or 86 percent of the watershed.  If individual TES map units are assessed 
roughly 26,660 acres or 80 percent of the study area is accounted for by units 582, 584, 585, and 
586.  The remaining 20 percent of the watershed is comprised of 14 map units that account for 
6,370 acres, though some of the highest potential for significant erosion and sedimentation is 
found within these units.             
     Results of erosion and sedimentation modeling are found in Tables 9 and 10.  When averaged 
over ten years, the soil loss tolerance is not exceeded even with the highest value attained in the 
wildfire scenario.  Although not in the tables, the modeling shows that for both ecological 
restoration and wildfire the soil loss tolerance will be exceeded in Strata 4 and 6 for at least 
several years.  These strata have the highest potential for declines in water quality from 
ecological restoration treatments or from wildfire.  This indicates that special care in sale 
administration needs to be taken when treating these moderately steep and steep slopes.  It is

 highly likely that the rate shown for sedimentation after a wildfire would decrease after several 
years to pretreatment levels, especially on the 0 to 15% slopes.  Based on the results found in 
Tables 9 and 10, it is reasonable to assume a tenfold increase in sediment delivery into Upper 
Lake Mary following the wildfire scenario described above. 
 
Effects of Wildfire on Hydrology  
     The effects of wildfire on hydrologic processes depend much more on fire severity, or the 
amount of fuel consumed and the overall effects of the fire, than on fire intensity, which is a 
measure of heat release.  Burning of volatile organic compounds in vegetation can cause reduced 
infiltration and water repellency in soils (Ice et al. 2004, DeBano et al. 2005).  These effects can 
last for months or in some cases, for a year or more (Huffman et al. 2001).  Increases in surface 
erosion and dry ravel often occur following wildfires, and slope failures and debris torrents can 
further degrade hydrologic function (Ice et al. 2004).  Severe wildfire in the mixed-conifer 
vegetation type results in significant increases in sedimentation and erosion, and a single 
catastrophic wildfire can produce thousands of tons of excess sediment over a period of 
thousands of years due to the environmental changes it causes (Megahan and King 2004).  For 
severe wildfires in the ponderosa pine type, significant increases in erosion can be expected, as 
well as an initial spike in streamflow of 30% or more (Brown et al. 1974).  In the Stermer Ridge 
watersheds of central Arizona, peak flows following the Rodeo-Chediski fire were found to be as 
much as 90 times pre-fire peak flows (Gottfried et al. 2003, Ice et al. 2004).  The highest known 
post-fire peak flow in southwestern ponderosa pine was recorded on the severely burned 
watershed in 2002; this flow was 2,350 times the size of pre-fire peak flows (Gottfried et al. 

 
62
2003, Ice et al. 2004).  Floods of these magnitudes can be at least as destructive as the severe fire 
itself.  Stream habitat, wildlife and fisheries populations, cultural resources, and human 
developments can all be severely damaged by flooding following severe wildfires (Neary et al. 
2005a).  Water quality can also be seriously impacted by a severe wildfire.  Increased 
sedimentation and nitrates and introduction of heavy metals from soils and chemicals used to 
fight the fire are of primary concern (Neary et al. 2005b).  In addition, nutrient cycles can be 
interrupted or radically changed, with increased concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorous, 
calcium, magnesium, potassium, and in some cases, phosphorous occurring after severe fires (Ice 
et al. 2004).  Nitrate concentrations from burned foliage can reach contamination levels 
following catastrophic wildfires, a situation exacerbated by the fact that many fire retardant 
chemicals contain large amounts of nitrogen (Neary et al. 2005b).       
 
CONCLUSIONS AND MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS 
     Reductions in forest overstory density in southwestern ponderosa pine and mixed conifer 
offer numerous benefits in terms of increased streamflows, improvements in forest health, and 
reduced risk of catastrophic wildfire.  In the Upper Lake Mary watershed, all forested areas are 
outside the historic range of variability for overstory density as expressed by presettlement 
reference conditions, and all inventory strata except Strata 1 (parks and meadows) are outside the 
historic range of variability for canopy cover.  Changes in water yield, sedimentation, and 
erosion were modeled in this analysis; one passive and three active forest management 
alternatives were considered.  Water yield improvements were greater with increasing thinning 
intensity, as was reduction in risk of catastrophic wildfire.  The former can be accounted for by a 
variety of factors, of which reduced evapotranspiration is primary.  The latter effect is due

Table 9.  Projected erosion in the Upper Lake Mary watershed by inventory stratum for four management alternatives.  
Values are averaged over ten years.  No treatments exceed the soil loss tolerances in this time frame, although ecological 
restoration treatments and severe wildfire exceed the tolerances in the first few years following treatment in Strata 4 and 6.  
Stratum 3 (chained areas), which is not recommended for treatment, has very low tree density and it is unlikely that either 
crown or ground fires will occur in these areas. 
Table 10.  Projected sediment deliveries in the Upper Lake Mary watershed by inventory stratum for four management alternatives.  Values are 
averaged over ten years.  Values for the three active management alternatives are relatively low in all strata.  Significant sedimentation from these 
treatments is not expected, especially if best management practices are followed.  Sediment rates for severe wildfire are much higher than current 
sediment rates and sediment rates for the three active management scenarios.  Sedimentation of these magnitudes could impede watershed function, 
especially if the fire occurs in Stratum 4 and/or Stratum 6.

mainly to decreased fuel loads, ladder fuels, and degree of canopy closure.  If left untreated, 
wildfire outside the natural range of variability is likely in the watershed.  Such an event could 
greatly reduce water quality in Upper Lake Mary, especially for the first few years following the 
fire.   
     Specific findings and recommendations of this analysis include:   
• 
The precipitation threshold for surface water production, generally thought to be 18-20 
inches (450-500 mm) annually, is exceeded in all areas of the Upper Lake Mary 
watershed.    
• 
At least 20% of the watershed must be treated under all active management scenarios in 
order for streamflow increases to occur. 
• 
Inventory strata 1 (parks and meadows) and 3 (chained areas) show little water yield 
response to thinning treatments, partly because current basal areas are relatively low in 
comparison to other strata.  Low treatment priority is assigned to Stratum 1.  Although 
restoration of parks and meadows is a desirable forest management activity in terms of 
process restoration and forest health improvement, this stratum is currently at low risk for 
wildfires outside the natural range of variability.  In addition, water yield increases 
following forest treatment are minor.  No treatments are recommended for Stratum 3.  
Treatments in this stratum would have little effect on potential for catastrophic wildfire, 
restoration of structure and processes, or water yield. 
• 
Treatment priority should be given to Stratum 4 (shallow to moderately deep, medium to 
fine-textured soils, 15-40% slope), focusing on the slopes of the drainages that transport 
overland surface flows into Upper Lake Mary.  This stratum is the farthest from its 
reference conditions, and offers good potential for water yield increases and fire risk 

 
65
reduction from thinning treatments.  Treatments in this stratum are critical because of 
high tree density, canopy cover, and forest floor fuel loads.  Due to its landscape position, 
this stratum has the greatest potential to affect water quality in Upper Lake Mary should a 
severe wildfire occur.  Severe wildfire in Stratum 4 would result in erosion exceeding the 
soil loss tolerance for several years, with projected sediment delivery rates of 2,505 tons 
per year.  Ecological restoration treatments on Stratum 4 would approach the soil loss 
tolerance.  Care must therefore be taken to follow best management practices to minimize 
erosion and sedimentation caused by harvesting activities.  Annual surface flow increases 
for the three active management options range from approximately 3% to 29%.  Total 
annual surface flow production in Stratum 4 ranges from 2,579 acre-feet for the 25% thin 
alternative to 3,513 acre-feet following ecological restoration.   
• 
The areas of 15-40% slope within Stratum 6 (shallow to moderately deep, medium to 
fine-textured soils, 15-80% slope in mixed conifer) should be treated next.  High tree 
densities, canopy cover, and fuel loads (both on the forest floor and in the form of dead 
standing trees) indicate that this stratum is also at risk for catastrophic wildfire.  Such a 
fire would cause the soil loss tolerance to be exceeded for several years, with projected 
sediment delivery rates of 1,075 tons per year. Ecological restoration treatments in 
Stratum 6 would approach the soil loss tolerance, but these effects can be minimized 
through proper application of best management practices.  During harvesting operations, 
dead standing trees should be removed in addition to live trees in the areas where they are 
present in order to reduce fire risk.  Treatment is not recommended on the portions of 
Stratum 6 above 40% slope.  In order to mitigate spotting during a wildfire, treated areas 
surrounding untreated steep slopes should be at least 1 mile wide.  Yearly water yield 

 
66
increases range from 6% following 25% reduction in basal area to 18.5% for ecological 
restoration treatments.  Total annual surface flow production increases in Stratum 6 
would range from 987 acre-feet to 1,139 acre-feet.   
• 
Soil loss tolerance is not exceeded in Strata 2, 5, 7, or 8 for any of the management 
alternatives, nor is it exceeded in the severe wildfire scenario.  This is partly due to the 
fact that these strata occur on 0-15% slopes.  Sediment delivery rates are relatively high 
for Strata 5 and 7, due to the fact that these are the largest strata in the watershed.   
• 
Treatment is next recommended for Stratum 8 (moderately deep to deep, fine-textured 
soils, 0-15% slope in mixed conifer) because of high levels of coarse woody debris and 
dead standing trees, the removal of which will reduce overall fire risk in the watershed.  
Aspen decline is of concern in this stratum; dead standing aspen and white fir should be 
cut, as should live ponderosa pine where it is replacing aspen.  If possible, fences should 
be constructed to encourage aspen reproduction and prevent browsing of seedlings.  
Annual surface flow increases in Stratum 8 range from just over 4% (25% thin) to nearly 
17% (restoration).  Total yearly water yield increases in this stratum are low because of 
the limited size of this stratum.  They range from 247 acre-feet to 285 acre-feet for the 
three active management alternatives.      
• 
The remaining strata (2, 5, and 7) occupy 70% of the watershed.  These strata offer very 
good results in terms of both water yield increases and reduction of fire risk, but 
treatments here are not as crucial for watershed protection as in the other strata with 
higher treatment priorities.  Large openings are included in Stratum 1, but small parks, 
meadows and other openings also occur in Strata 2, 5, and 7.   Restoration of these areas 

 
67
should be a primary consideration in all treatment areas, as well as removal of white fir 
encroachment wherever it occurs.   
• 
Of these three remaining strata, Stratum 2 (moderately deep, medium to fine-textured 
soils, 0-15% slope in ponderosa pine with pinyon-juniper) would provide the largest 
percentage gains in water yield following forest treatments, but the smallest increases in 
total water production because of its limited size.  Annual percentage increases range 
from nearly 7% to nearly 25% for the three active management options, with total surface 
flows ranging from 343 acre-feet to 426 acre-feet. 
• 
Annual water yield increases in Stratum 5 (moderately deep to deep, fine-textured soils, 
0-15% slope) range from 4% to 22% for the three active management alternatives.  Total 
annual water production following forest treatments is sizable, since this stratum occupies 
over 38% of the watershed.  These values range from 5,961 acre-feet to 7,318 acre-feet. 
• 
In Stratum 7 (shallow to moderately deep, fine-textured soils, 0-15% slope), modeling of 
the three thinning scenarios shows that yearly streamflow increases would be between 55 
and 22%, while the total yearly surface flow production would be between 4,700 acre-
feet and 5,727 acre-feet.    
• 
Encroaching white fir occurs mainly in Strata 6 and 8, although it is not limited to these 
areas.  Primarily seedlings and saplings, these trees should be removed where they are 
replacing other species in ponderosa pine, aspen, and mixed conifer stands.  This will 
improve forest health, reduce competition, and help to reverse some of the effects of 100 
years of wildfire suppression.  Since white fir is not fire adapted, and because the 
encroaching trees from heavy thickets of ladder fuels, removal of them will also reduce 
fire risk and hazard.   

 
68
Ecological Restoration and Maintenance of Water Yield Response 
     Ecological restoration treatments result in the largest decreases in basal area and therefore the 
greatest increases in surface flows in this analysis.  A caveat is that uncertainty exists with 
respect to the effects of restoration treatments on snowpack and therefore surface flows.  While 
surface flow increases and reduction of fire risk can be achieved to a lesser extent by the 25% 
thin and 50% thin management alternatives, these options are not self-sustaining in terms of 
these effects.  Vegetative regrowth in the absence of fire in the years following treatments 
generally limits long-term water yield response in ponderosa pine until eventually, the initial 
water yield increases are entirely lost (Baker 1986).  Ecological restoration can provide sustained 
water yields and reduced fire risk in addition to the other benefits it offers, such as improved 
forest health and ecological processes.  However, prescribed fire treatments applied in 
approximately five-year intervals will most likely be necessary to maintain water yield response.  
Intervals greater than five years could lead to reduction in initial surface flow response following 
thinning treatments.   
     The Upper Lake Mary watershed is a prime candidate for restoration treatments.  Stands of 
very dense poles and doghair thickets are not continuous across the landscape, native understory 
species are abundant, and the presence of exotic species is limited.  If thinning activities are 
planned and located strategically, treatment costs on a per acre basis should be relatively low, 
especially if activity planning is centered around the numerous large and small forest openings in 
the watershed.  Thinning treatments will restore overstory structure, and restoration of processes 
and composition should follow with reintroduction of a fire regime within the natural range of 
variability.  In addition, ecological restoration treatments will provide the greatest increases in 
water yield, and the highest level of protection against catastrophic wildfires of the four 

 
69
management alternatives considered.  In their presentation of a broad perspective of restoration 
in ponderosa pine, Allen et al. (2002) conclude that treatments should focus on restoring natural 
processes and reduce the threat of crown fires, and that priority in ecological restoration 
treatments should be given to areas near human developments and important watersheds.
