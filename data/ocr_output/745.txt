Forests and communities at risk

More than a century of fire exclusion, grazing, and logging have left southwestern
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests overstocked and unhealthy, prone to
widespread mortality from insect outbreaks and catastrophic crown fires. These
fires threaten not just the forest but numerous forest communities as well.

In recent years land managers and researchers have experimented with a variety
of treatments to these forests (mostly including thinning dense, young trees and
reintroducing periodic fire in the form of controlled burns), in an effort to restore
ecosystem health and reduce the risk of crown fires, which threaten not just the
forest but numerous forest communities as well. While most of these efforts have
been relatively small (a few hundred acres or less), the amount of land across the
Southwest in need of attention is huge.

Researchers and resource
managers join forces

In 1995, the Bureau of Land Management,
Northern Arizona University, and the Arizona
State Game and Fish Department initiated a
collaborative effort to study restoration methods
and results across a large landscape in the
remote forested uplands of the Grand Canyon-
Parashant National Monument.

A 4,000-acre laboratory

The Mount Trumbull Ecosystem Restoration Project encompasses about 4000
acres of ponderosa pine forest, and serves as a laboratory for researchers and
land managers to test and refine methods for restoring ponderosa pine forests
which may be applicable in similar forests around the Southwest.

Many academic and agency researchers have established studies at Mount
Trumbull, to utilize the unique resource presented by this landscape scale
project. Researchers from the Arizona Game and Fish Department have
studied the effects of restoration treatments on wildlife species from mule deer
and songbirds to butterflies and lizards. Northern Arizona University's
Ecological Restoration Institute research crews are measuring effects of
restoration treatments on the forest trees and vegetation communities.

Since the project's inception, about 1100 acres of the study area have received
the full restoration treatment (thinning and burning, and often seeding with
understory plant species), with about the same acreage in various stages of
treatment. Much of the rest will remain untreated to evaluate the effects of no
action, and to provide for heterogeneity across the landscape.
