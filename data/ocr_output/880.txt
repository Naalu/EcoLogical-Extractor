NEW RESEARCH: Resource Objective Wildfires

Resource objective wildfires. or unplanned ignition tires. are monitored and

managed by land management agencies to achieve resource management
objectives such as hazardous fuels reduction The use of resource objective

wildtires has increased in recent years. however. there 1s litile research to



Page 2:
determine whether these wildtires actually actieve restoration goals and
objectives, lke sufficiently changing forest structure consistent with restoring
ecological health and resilience to forests,

(n February. a group of EAI sciennsts released a paper in Forest Ecology and
Management detaibng findings trom their study on the ethicacy of resource
objective wildtires for restoration of ponderosa pine forests in northern Anzona
(nthe first study of its kind, researchers randomly selected 10 resource
‘objective wildfires based on several cnteria, They used tour burn severity
classes —unbured/low. low burn, moderate. and high seventy —to stratily held
sampling, and evaluated 12 structural and hazardous luels attnbutes within
those severity classes,

The ecologists found statistically signthicant differences among burn severity
Classes in tree density, basal area. coarse wood loads, canopy cover, and
canopy fuel loads, Areas classilied as moderate burn seventy met histone
ranges of variability (HRV) for more attnbutes (67 percent) than did other areas
Wn olher severity classes, High seventy was within HAV Jor the fewest (17
percent) of the 12 aftnbutes. The results sugges! that the effectiveness of
resource objective wildhires for meeting restoration goals may be increased by
managing for proportionally more moderate burn severity and allowing greater
tree mortality across landscapes. However. with this approach managers will
hkely face challenges related to public acceptance and increased potential for
undesirable. high severity and escaped Ines.

This study evaluated potential impacts of ecological restoration treatments on
genetic diversity of ponderosa pine populations within the Fort Valley
Experimental Forest near Flagstat!, AZ. Overall results indicate use ol genetic
structure and diversity can help guide restoration treatments to help ensure
adaptive potential is conserved.

(n this study, ecologists analyzed 10-year understory plant community
responses to restoration treatments that included: tree thinning to approximate
historical densities of pinyon pine and juniper. scattering of thinning slash to
improve soil conditions. and seeding at two woodland sites in northwestern
Anzona. This treatment resulted in only minor changes in understory cover and
species nchness at both sites.

Notes from the Field

Research and Development — 2017 Summer Field Season Outlook
By Dave Huttman, Director of Research and Delivery

During the summer of 2017, the ERI will continue to work with the Mogollon
Rim Ranger District of the Coconino National Forest to implement a
randomized, replicated study of restoration treatments in warm/dry mixed-
conifer forests. Information on restoration options in these important
ecosystems 1s lacking and urgently needed. Study sites have been established
and pretreatment data on the forest structure, vegetation, and hazardous tuels
have been collected

Also in 2017, the ERI will inmate a study to quantity histoncal fire regimes and
structural charactensties in ponderosa pine forests growing at lower elevations,
below the Mogolion Rim (see the Science Delivery notes for nial outreach
activities on this project). Histoncal reference information far these vegetation
communities 1s lacking, and this project will allow forest managers to develop



Page 7:
science-based restoration prescnptions and more clearly evaluate treatment
outcomes. Field crews will establish sample plots and collect tree increment
cares and fire scars for reconstruction analyses.

Lastly, ERI field crews will re-measure long-term monitoring plots established n
pinyon-juniper woodlands on the Tusayan Ranger Distnct of the Kaibab
Natonal Forest. Very few replicated studies have examimed restoration and
hazardous tuels reduction treatment responses in southwestern pinyon-juniper
woodlands. Thus study will provide forest and woodland managers with critically
needed information about pinyon-juniper woodland restoration and adaptive
management.

ERI Science Delivery and Outreach News
By Amy Waltz, Director of Science Delivery

The EAI 1s commited to assessing science needs and
communicating primary restoration science to our land
management partners to better meet forest
management goals. A few highlights across this broad
program af work include

Wast-Wide. Science delivery staff shared Broader-Scale Monitonng project
(part of the 2012 Planning Rule requirements) outcomes al the Region 3
planners workshop in Albuquerque. All the national forests in New Mexico and
the Tonte National Forest in Anzana are revising forest plans under the 2012
Planning Rule. with opportunities to synchronize their Broader-Seale Monitoring
Plans across two or more forests

Forest Projects. Not all ponderosa pine forests are as well studied as those on
the Colorado Plateau. The ERI Research and Delivery team initiated fire history
and forest recansiruction work in the less-studied transitional pine habitat —
ponderosa pine over shrub and deckiuous communities, where pine is
transitioning 1o tower elevation vegetation types. Our science delivery work for
this project includes planrung a tall workshop an the fire history work with the
Prescott, Tonto, and Coronado national forests to look at available science, first
held season abservations, and managers’ lessons-learned and additional
information needs.
