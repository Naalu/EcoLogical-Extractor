Restoration Increases Resilience to Climate Change in
Southwestern Ponderosa Pine Forests
‘An Analyses of 20 Years of Forest Restoration Treatments

Arocent study lad by Nike Stoddard and a team of ERI-NAU ecologests
examined two decades of ecological responses to forest restoration reaiments,
1 a set of stes m ER's Long-term Ecological Assessment and Restoration
Network (LEAFIN). The analysis showed that restoraton treatments mcrease
‘esikence to climate change in southwestem ponderosa pave forests.

for the past few decades. questions remain regarding long-term ettectveness
‘40d potential for iresiments to increase ecological resitence to changing
‘cimetic conditions and severe widiire.

‘The team’s objectives were to compere long-term forest responses in paired
rested and untreated contol units across & range of pondernes pine sles to
‘assess ixcScators of lorest resience to climatic stressors and potential crown
ee. They alec used a clmate-seretive simulation model to precict luke.
‘ouicomes for not only Ireaiment peirs but historical reference conditions.

‘The siudy Coronetrated that evidence-based restoration frestments — inoer
that approximate site-speciic patterns of free deresty, spatial locations, and
eurtace fre — have (esting eflects on canopy fuels and forest siruchwse. which

‘sieo showed #. conceming toss of ponderoes pine basal ares toward the end of
the climate change simuaation period (2090) under a moderate emissions

iesuits trom the study also suggested that management of fre regimes even st
longer.tner-historical infervats may be needed to maintain besal area within ine
historical range of vesiabilly, and could allow sufficient opportuniies for pine
eeedtings to establieh under a moderate tevel of cimate change.
