ABSTRACT

‘Thc main argument of this dissertation is that the White Moyataia Apache Tribe's appeoprintion of
‘ecnkogicalreuoration played a vital role ia reimatieting control over Lacrateige prodhctina amd <co-
ataral resource am the Font Apache lain Reservation ta the som ball of te twemticth comary. As
2 corollary, | arpve that he shi? in kaovtedge provtuction practices from a pabeenabitic Foundation to a
‘omamuanity ated approach setied ia positive comarquences for the ecological heath of the Apachran
lamdacape and Apache culnure. The democratization of wcipare aad techaoing on the reservation,
tiesefare, proved paramowat to the eepstablishenead of a relutively wudainable Apache sacicty

‘Beginning wish the Indian New Deal the Whise Mowataia Apache Jomly developed the capacity 10
‘employ ecological reuoratinn as an oco-polidical nol ko free emmetves from a hang hishry of Earo-
American coltaral oppertsinn and aatural resowece exploitation. Tribal prinration projects embodied the
‘al political function of culawral resistance to amd cwltwral exchange wid Wentern-tase Land
smenagement organizations, Apacs resistance challenged Faro-American motions of restoration, aabare,
aad sastainabilty while maintaining culmaral identity. reauserting cobural aviomomy. amd protecting

sae Lan management apeacies to vacorsafelly manage thee ashural esoveprs and build an ecologically
Ikmowledipeable tribal workforce.
