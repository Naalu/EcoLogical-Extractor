Landecepe-Seale Restoretion implementation

‘© Federal land managers are striving lo innovate in order to incresse the
pace and scale of restoration. On Oct. 29-90, the ERI tacittated

1 Modernization Workshop for 100 Forest Service staf! and pariners to
advance understanding and adoption ol new lechnology. The workshop.
focused on tablet marking, virtual boundaries, and remote sensing tools.
A peer-to-peer learning formet gave participants hands-on exposure 10
tech tools and the early adopters who are using them.

The EFI works closely with the Four Foreet Restoration initiettve
stakehokders and the Forest Service aa science providers and vested
Perticipants in this landecepe-scale fores! restoration project. We are
helping fead the stakeholder group in developing collaborative, science-
based comments for ihe second large project ares. Comments on the
Fin Country Ora Erevironmental impact Statement are due Jan. 15,
2020. Céck hase for more indo.
