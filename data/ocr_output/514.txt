and Social Integrity of
Greater Ecosystems

The Challenge

» The ecologic, economic, and social integrity
of the American West has been declining at
an accelerating rate throughout the past
century

» Nowhere is the rate of loss as great as it is
in landscapes once dominated by open
long-needled pine savannas and forests

» Ponderosa pine forests are the most
widespread of these threatened types


Page 3:
Background

» Greater ecosystem context

> Threatened and endangered ecosystems

» Increased funding and focus on restoration
and conservation of threatened wildlands
and their embedded human communities

» Healthy Forest Restoration Act, Healthy
Forest Initiative, Hazardous Fuel Reduction,
Conservation Reserve Design


Page 4:
What exactly are greater ecosystems,
anyway?

» Greater ecosystems are regional complexes
of ecosystems with common landscape-level
characteristics.

» They are linked by wide ranging wildlife,
landscape scale disturbance regimes, and,

» human communities as keystone citizens
among the community of organisms.

>» They typically occur at half-million to 2-
million acre in area.


Page 5:
How are restoration ecology,
conservation biology, evolutionary
theory, and human ecology linked?


Page 6:
Where are we?

The greater ecosystems of the West are
exhibiting alarming disease symptoms
» Population irruptions and population crashes

> Spread of invasive exotic plants

» Decreasing diversity, increasing
homogeneity at all levels of the ecosystem

» Unnatural disturbance regimes: fire, insects

» Trajectory of spiraling decline of ecological
and social system health

» Restoring and reconnecting naturalness to
conserve biodiversity, enhance human
habitats, and reduce unnatural fire and
insect disturbances

Restoration vs. Fuel Breaks

>» Fuel breaks

» Restoration corridors and patches

> The matrix past, present and future
» Urban: wildland interface

> Threatened human habitats

> Threatened wildlife habitats

» Conservation reserve networks

» Ecological restoration to break a crownfire
alley

» 3600 acres to the SW and downhill from the
Mount Trumbull Wilderness

Kendrick Mountain Wilderness

» Proposed restoration corridor to the SW and
downhill

» Not implemented (funding and anticipated
political conflict)

What is adaptive management?

» Ruthlessly embracing uncertainty

» Stakeholder-based structured learning

» Bayesian statistics—the theoretical
underpinning of adaptive management

» The adaptive environmental assessment
(AEA) workshop approach (Crawford S.
Holling and Cari Walters)

» How much can a group get done in three
days?


Page 12:
Thinking big, long-term, large area,
and across the ecological hierarchy

>» Thinking like a mountain, a watershed, a
spotted owl...you get the picture

» Thought experiments in conservation
planning

» If you were a time traveler from 40 yr in the
future, what would you do?

> If you were an extraterrestrial interested in
conserving biodiversity, what would you do?

What will be our landscape legacy?

» What kind of landscape would we like to
have inherited?

» What kind of landscape would we like to
pass along to future generations?

» The legacy forest concept—Covington and
others 1994

Thinning Treatment
» Retain trees which predate settlement

» Retain postsettlement trees needed to re-
establish presettlement structure

» Thin excess trees (cutting or jackpotting)

» Rake heavy fuels from base of trees

» Burn to emulate natural disturbance
regime

» Seed with natives/contro! exotics

Change Basic Prescription for
Specific Resource Objectives

» Might leave more trees to accommodate
specific resource management objectives,
e€.g., screening cover for human or wildlife
habitat goals, future wood harvesting,
favoring specific uses

» Might leave fewer trees to accommodate
other objectives, e.g., to favor viewsheds,
wildlife goals, grazing, water balance

It matters what we do.

» Conserving critical landscape components is
essential

» Half-hearted measure are likely to be ineffective

» Strategic investment in getting adaptive
conservation on the ground is imperative

» Integrating the science and practice of
conservation planning, conservation biology,
restoration ecology, and adaptive management
must be done now, not later

The least you need to know

» The dry, frequent fire ecosystems of the West are
threatened

» Humans are an integral component of these
ecosystems

» Restoring ecological and social integrity for the
future requires strategic management action today

» Conservation, restoration, and adaptive
management practice is imperative

» Time is rapidly running out
