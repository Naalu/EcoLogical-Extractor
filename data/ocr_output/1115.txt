What photos can teach us about ecosystem change and
restoration

Over the years, the ERI has compiled histoncal-current photos and repeat
photos of before and after restoration treatments to use as visual
communication tools Pariners often requests these photos, and we are
pleased to share that they are now available on our «1, Each set of photos
1s taken from the same photo point. and the photos are overlaid to be
interactive —a slider tool allows you to slide back and forth trom the “betore” (or
