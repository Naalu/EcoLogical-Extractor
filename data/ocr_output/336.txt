In 1995, the Ecological Restoration
Institute (ERN at Northern Arizona
University. the US. Departnent
of the Interior Buren of Land
Management (BLM), and the
‘Arizona Game & ish Department
{ALGED} began a collaborative
effort to implement landscape:
scale restorauon treatments in a
ponderosa pine ecosystem at Mt.
‘Trumbull, located int northwestern
‘Arizona, The primary goal of the
progect waa to restore forest struc-
ture and ecosystem processes with
an the historical ranges of varvabil-
ity (Moore and others 1999) with
an adaptive management approach.
Other project objectives included
reducing fuel toads, dtrupting
fuel continuity, and reducing the
Bkelihood of stand-replacing crown
fires by emplementing mechanical
thinning followed by prescribed fire
(Moore and others 2003, Roceaforte
and others 2008}. The prosect also
2imed at providing revearch oppor.
Cunities in a southwestern ponde-
aaa pine ecosystem.

We initiated 2 study to exarnine
canopy fuels and potential fire
behavior during three time periods:
1870 (prefire-excusion), 1996/97
(pre-treatment), and 2003 (post-
treatment), Our goals were to:

fuel estimation approaches:

Using tree-ring analysis, we recon-
structed a prefire-exchusion stand
structure for the year 1870, In 1996
and 1997, we installed permanent
monitoring plots and collected pre-
trealment forest structure data for
‘atimating canopy fuel load (CFL)
and canopy bulk density (CBD}

(fig. 1). Approsimately half of the
study area, a contiguous, densely:
treed area, was left untreated ard
sed a4 a control. By 2003, most of
the other half had recerved restora:
‘hon treatments—thinned andor
burned with prescribed surface fire
(Roceaforte and others [in press).
‘We collected post-treatment data
{for each plot in the summer of
‘2003. Stand structure data were
used to derive CPL and CBD in the
study area for all three time peri-
‘ods. Those estimates were then fed
into two fire models to compare

fire behavior on the control ste

‘There are various methods for

estimating CFL and CBD. and the

resulting estimates can vary widely.

Many methods rely on ablometric

‘equations that estimate the mass of

foliage and fine twigs based on tree

diameter. We examined three com
mon techniques that are based on
the following equations:

+ Fulé and others’ (2001 allomet-
ric equations for foliage and fine
twigs of ponderosa pine developed
in Arizona,

+ Brown's (1378) allometric equa

‘scale equations based on tree
density and basal area.
