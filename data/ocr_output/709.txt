INTRODUCTION

More than a century ago, Lt. Edward Beale wrote
of northern Arizona: “It ig the most beautiful region
I ever remember to have seen in any part of the
world. A vast forest of gigantic pines, intersected
frequently with open glades, sprinkled all over with
mountains, meadows, and wide savannahs, and cov-
ered with the richest grasses, was traversed by our
party for many days.” (quoted by Bell, 1870). There
are those today who would agree with the lieutenant’s
conclusions, but the northern Arizona countryside is
no longer the same land that Beale saw in 1857.
Eighty-five years of white man’s use and occupancy
have profoundly altered the forest landseape. North-
ern Arizona is particularly suitable for a study of
the dynamics of vegetation change under the in-
finence of the white man and his use of the land.
Here these changes have taken place within the life-
time of men still living, and are easier to trace than
in longer-settled regions.

As in Beale’s day, an almost unbroken band of
ponderosa pine forest 25 to 40 mi wide and nearly
300 mi long spreads across central and northern
Arizona. With outliers in the higher mountains
throughout the state, it constitutes one of the largest
Fine forests in North America. Of the more than
3,000,000 A of commercial forest land in Arizona,

by far the largest part supports a nearly pure stand
of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). (The botanical
nomenclature of Kearney & Peebles (1951) is fol-
lowed throughout.) The pine zone occupies most of
the mountain and plateau country above about 6,500
ft. On the higher peaks, above about 8,500 ft, the
pine is largely replaced by a mixed forest of Douglas
fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), white fir (Abies con-
color), and other species. Below the pine forest lies
a pinon-juniper woodland,

This study of vegetation change was approached
on the aue hand from the historical viewpoint. Due
to the late settlement of the region, Arizona is almost
unique in the United States in that reasonably well-
planned scientific exploration preceded extensive
exploitation, Many carly travellers left records of
their impressions of the pine forest country. Indi-
vidually, these early reports are of little value in
reconstructing the vegetation of the past century.
Cumulatively, however, they build up a fairly clear
picture.

The second approach was analysis of stand strue-
ture, The present umture forest, with an overstory
of trees aged 150 yrs and more, obviously originated
before white settlement. The structure of the ma-
ture forest was studied aud compared with that of
the young forest that will comprise the overstory of
the future,

THE HISTORICAL EVIDENCE

“, . . the first dayes we founde no grasse, but
worser way of mountaines and badde passages, then
we had passed alreadie: and the horses being tired,
were greatly molested therewith.” In those unflatter-
ing terms the first white man to leave a permanent
record described his visit to the White Mountains
(Letter, Coronado to Mendoza, August 3, 1540.
Translated in Hakluyt, 1600:375). Franeiseo Vas-
quez Coronado forded the Gila River somewhere
below the present town of Safford, and crossed the
White Mountains to the Indian town of Zuni. Thus
began some three centuries of sporadic visits to the
northern Arizona mountains by Spanish adventurers,
missionaries, and would-be colonists. The mountain
region was occupied by nomadie food-gathering In-
dians, mostly Apaches and their close relatives, the
Navajos. The Spanish conquistadores found that
these people could not be conquered by the means
then available to Spain, they would not stay con-
verted, and they had no property worth stealing
(Webb, 1931). So, “Nearly all of what we now call
Arizona has no other history before 1846 than ‘the
record of exploring entradas from the south and
east” (Bancroft, 1889). A relatively few Apaches,
masters of guerilla warfare, were able to prevent white
settlement and to hold the country for themselves
for more than 300 yrs.

The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo transferred
Arizona and New Mexico to Américan jurisdiction
in 1848. Thereatter, the Apaches were an American
problen for nearly 40 yrs. Sporadic and confused
attempts at control were ended by the Civil War.
After the war, serious efforts to subdue the Apaches

Omar ay Connition OF THE Pix Forest

“We came to a glorious forest of lofty pines,
through which we have travelled ten miles. The
country was beautifully undulating, and although we
usually associate the idea of barrenness with the pine
regions, it was not so in this instance; every foot
being covered with the finest grass, and beautiful
broad grassy vales extending in every direction, The
forest was perfectly open and unencumbered with
brusk wood, so that the travelling was excellent.”
(Beale, 1858). The overwhelming impression that
one gets from the older Indians and white pioneers
of the Arizona pine region is that the entire forest
was once much more open and park-like than it is
today. A critical examination of early reports of
travellers in northern Arizona at the time of white
settlement may shed some light on primeval forest.
conditions, and on changes in those conditions within
historic times.

There are no reliable reports from the northern
nouatains until after 1848, The first official expe-
dition, under Capt. Lorenzo Sitgreaves, missed imost
of the forest area. Lt. Whipple in 1853 led a party
surveying a possible route for a transcontinental
railroad along the 35th parallel. Lt. Beale, command-
ing the famous hand of camels that was expected to
revolutionize transportation in the Southwest, crossed
the area in 1857 and again in the winter of 1858-59.
Lt. Ives explored the Colorado River and led the first
expedition into the Grand Canyon country.: After
the Civil War the nwuber of military and civilian
visitors inereased rapidly. The period of explora-
tion eulininated with the expeditions of the Wheeler
Survey, predecessor of the present U. S. Geological
Survey, in the years 1871-1875. Accompanying vir-
tually all these early expeditions was a naturalist
whose duty it was to deseribe the country for the
benefit of prospective settlers and to collect informa-
tion on the botany, zoology, and geology of the
region.

Most of the early travellers were impressed by the
open nature of the forest. Ives (1861) deseribed the
region at the base of Bill Williams Mountain: “This
morning we re-entered the region of pines, and have
travelled all day in the midst of picturesque and
charming scenery. The valleys are covered with a
bright green sward, and open groves are dispersed
gracefully upon the lowlands and ridges.” Joseph
Rothroek (1875), botanist with the Wheeler Survey,
wrote of the region just south of Gallup, New Mexico:
“Gaining the summit a thousand feet above Fort
Wingate, we were at an altitude of about 8000 feet
above the sea, a fine, open, park-like region with a
large growth of yellow pine (Pinus ponderosa) and
fir covering the hillsides. A diversified herbaceos
vegetation was out in the most brilliant colors, beauti-
fying alike the woods and open grounds. ... Goor?
forage was abundant.” This area today is alm at

bare of herbaceous ground cover, and dense thickets
of pine saplings predominate.

The glowing reports of Lt, Beale have already
been quoted. Whipple (1856) was more restrained
in his comments, but he too remarks on the open
rature of the pine forest. C. Hart Merriam (1890)
hazed his life zone concept largely on a study of verti-
eal c nation of vegetation on the San Francisco Moun-
tains. In desertbing his study area he said, “The
lava plateau above about 2130 meters (7000 feet) is
covered throughout with a beautiful forest of stately
pimes (Pinus ponderosa) which average at least 33
meters (100 feet) in height. There is no undergrowth
to obstruct the view, and after the rainy season the
grass beneath the trees is knee-deep in places, but
the growth is sparse on account of the rocky nature
of the surface.” Dutton’s classic “Physical Geology
of the Grand Cafion Region” (1887) says of the
Kaibab Plateau: “The trees are large and noble in
aspect and stand widely apart, except in the highest
part of the plateau where spruces predominate, In-
stead of dense thiekets where we are shut in by im-
penetrable foliage, we can look far beyond and see
the tree trunks vanishing away like an infinite colo-
nade. The ground is unobstructed and inviting.
There is a constant succession of parks and glades—
dreamy avenues of grass and flowers winding be-
tween sylvan walls, or spreading out in broad open
meadows, From June until September there is a
display of wild flowers which is quite beyond de-
scription,”

Although the early chroniclers were almost unan-
imous in their deseription of an open forest, it is evi-
dent that some reproduction did exist. Beadle (1873)
reported that on the Defiance Plateau, “The tall
sugar pines [sie] from three inches to two feet in
ameter, mingled with a few dwarfish oaks, were
scattered in regular proportion.” In a report on the
Gila River Forest Reserve, Rixon (1905) stated, “The
south side of Spring Creck is covered with a phe-
uumenal growth of young pine, approximating 30
fect in height and 6 inches in diameter.” In his
township by township description of the Reserve, he
red toa abundant growth of young pines in some
areas, while elsewhere it is not mentioned or is re-
marked as absent. Plummer (1904), in a similar
examination of the Black Mesn Forest Reserve, found
exceptionally heavy stands of young trees in some
places, Lieberg et al. (1904) were struck by the lack
of reproduction on the San Franeiseo Mountain
Forest Reserve pparently there has been an al-
tost camplete cessation of reproduction over véry
large arenas during the past twenty or twenty-five
years, and there is no evidence that previous to that
time it was at any period very exuberant.” Pearson
(1910) carly in his career noted that reproduction
was generally deficient both in the virgin forest and
after logging. Le noted, however, that reproduction
on thy Prescott National Forest was good and in
places so dense it was diffleult to walk through.

The early explorers were particularly conscious of

grass, upon which they depended to feed their horses.
Both Whipple (1856) and Beale (1858) commented
about the abundance of grass in the forested area,
but both observed that grass was more plentiful on
lava soils than on heavier soils derived from sedi-
mentary rocks. Lt. George Wheeler in 1873 was the
first white man to climb Mt. Baldy (Mt. Thomas),
the highest peak in the White Mountains. He re-
ported that “... a plateau bearing patches of hunch
grass is reached... . The animals feast upon the
yank and succulent mountain bunch grass.” (Wheeler,
1878). This would imply that good grass was not
universal in the mountains at that time. The same
conclusion can be drawn from the reports of Coro-
nado’s journey more than three centuries earlier.
Coronado (Winship, 1899) spoke feelingly of the
difficulty of crossing the White Mountains, and of the
good grass at Zuni, “of which we had great need,
because our horses were so weak and feeble when they
arrived,”

Rothrock (1878) described a dense grass cover in
the pine zone of southern Colorado: “In the beautiful
valley of the Conejos River, after striking the tim-
bered region, we found luxuriant bunch-grass cover-
ing the ground as thickly as it could stand. In
November it was still green about the roots, and was
eagerly eaten by our starved mules. Pinus ponderosa
formed open clumps, and under protection of these
trees it attained what seemed to be its maximum
growth.” Nelson (1884), a zoologist collecting for
the Smithsonian Institution, said of the region above
Springerville: “There is scarcely any undergrowth,
but a dense mat of grass and flowers in these forests,
and beautiful mountain parks are found at frequent
intervals."

In the University of Arizona Library is a collee-
tion of reports on range conditions in the first deeade
of this century. Although these reports bear no sig-
nature, there can be little doubt that they were writ-
ten by Dr. J. J. Thornber, Botanist at the Arizona
Agricultural Experiment Station. In July, 1905, he
travelled by wagon from San Carlos to Fort Apache,
across the Natanes Plateau. Thornber (1905) de-
seribedl the Natanes Plateau, which in many places
has almost no herbaceous vegetation beneath the pines
today, as follows: “The region is one for the most
part ungrazed, the bunches of grass maturing large
quantities of seed and then dying down to the
ground again, thus forming a good surface covering.
Also the more or less continuous forest covering con-
tributes considerable in the way of protection for
the grasses, so that cffects of excessive drought and
heat are modified. With the above conditions, it
would hardly be too much, except in the densely
shaded portions, to expect a continuous turf or sod,
but such is the case only for small areas. Most if
not all of the grasses are of the xerophytie bunch-
grass type; these bunches usually occur at intervals
of a few inches to a few feet. They are apparently
as abundant on one slope as another. Between these
bunches of grass are interspersed many annual and


Page 4:

perennial species, so that there is quite a continuous
vegetative covering everywhere over the mountains.
In addition to the forest layer, already noted, and the
layer of herbs and grasses, there is a fairly well-
defined shrub and undershrub layer; in ordinarily
closely browzed foot hills and mountains many of
these shrubs are considerably browzed by eattle, but
so far as could be seen none of these have been nib-
bled in the least... The region also showed no sign
of erosion or gullying, except perhaps where dug
away by the hand of man, as along the road.” Further
on, as hy travelled from Fort Apache toward the
town of Pinetop, he uoted, “There is a thin layer of
perennial grasses, covering most of the land from
Cooley’s to Fort Apache, although it rarely ap-
proaches a turf. At this time there is good grazing,
but few or no cattle.”

At the time of Thornber’s visit such good range
conditions could probably have been found only on
the Indian reservations. More typical were the condi-
tions that Plummer (1904) found on the Black Mesa
Forest Reserve. Here forage grasses grew luxuriant-
ly, but only at a distance from water. Careasses of
cattle and horses showed where they had died of thirst
after getting too far from water in search of pasture.
Beaver Creek, a tributary of the Verde River, was
cited as an example of overstocking, resulting in the
“complete annihilation of pasture in a formerly rich
area.”

Deterioration of watershed condition began com-
paratively early. Bryan (1925) stated that the Rio
de Flag, a small creek flowing through a grassy flood
plain in the pine region near Flagstaff, had en-
trenched itself in an arroyo 10 to 20 ft deep. He
dated this trenching from 1890 to 1892. That gullies
originally were rare in the forest area can be in-
ferred from Dutton’s (1887) comments about the
Kaibab Plateau: “. .. every ravine is as smooth as a
lawn and carpeted with a rich turf of mountain grass,
richly decked with flowers of rare beauty and luxuri-
ance.”

Pattie (1903) camped on the Gila River in 1826,
apparently not far below Gila Hot Springs. He said,
“T began to ascend the bank of the stream to ex-
plore. ... The first day we were fatigued by the
difficulty of getting through the high grass, which
covered the heavily timbered bottom.” There is little
grass in the eroded Gila Canyon today. Leopold
(1921) said of Blue River, a tributary of the upper
Gila, “All the old settlers agree that the bottoms of
Blue River were. at the time of settlement in about
1885, stirrup-high in gramma grass, and covered with
groves of mixed hardwoods and pine. The banks
were lined with willows and abundant with trout... .
Ahout 1900, fifteen years after settlement, floods be-
gan to cut an ever-widening channel.”

Wheeler (1878) stated that in the White Moun-
tains, “Elk, mountain sheep. California lion, deer,
antelope, wild turkey are known to be abundant tu
this range, and their fresh tracks were constantly
seen.” But game was not always plentiful. Nelson
(1884) wrote that“... the twentieth of Aug at found

us located at Springerville.... Although the moun-
tains about here have been noted for the abundance of
game in them during past years, yet all kinds of large
game were remarkably scaree during the past season,
Bear were not to be found at all, and elk were
so scarce that only a single fresh track was seen
during several weeks in the woods, Although the
vattlemen have invaded the district in force, vet they
have only touched the pine country at widely scat-
tered places, and I am unable to account for the
searcity of large game.” At about the same time,
Frazier (1884) visited the Apache Reservation on
behalf of the Indian Rights Association. He reported
that “Game is scarce on the reservation, and the
Indians find it difficult to find animal food.” Even
earlier, Indian Commissioner Dole noted a shortage of
gaine at the time of the Civil War (Ogle 1940). Thus
it appears that big game was by turns abundant and
locally searee even before white men had much in-
fluence on the region.

The most notable game animal in Arizona was the
Merriam elk, now extinct. Its principal range was
the White Mountains, but it oceurred throughout Ari-
zona and New Mexico. It was reported around Flag-
staff as late as 1884, and apparently persisted in iso-
lated areas until the early years of the present century.
Roeky Mountain elk have since been. transplanted to
Arizona.

The history of deer in Arizona has been one of
alternating searcity and overabundance. In most of
the mountain areas of the state deer have thrived
in recent years and are probably at least as numerous
as they have ever been. No really radical changes
have been noted in the abundance of most of the
other conspicuous forest animals—wild turkeys,
squirrels, and others. An intensive predator control
program has eliminated the grizzly bear and the wolf,
and considerably reduced the numbers of bear, enyotes,
and inountain lion.

Changes in the Arizona pine forests were suin-
marized more than 50 yrs ago by Holsinger (1902),
an examiner for the General Land Office: “Briefly,
the history of the forests of Arizona, which my oppor-
tunities have enabled me to gather from many of the
oldest reliable pioneers, is that when first invaded by
white man the forests were open, devoid of under-
growth, and consisted in the main of mature trees,
with practically no forest cover. Instead of forest
undergrowth, the ground was well sef with perennial
grasses and other herbage. which, being undisturbed,
maintained what may be called a normal condition,
or such as existed when the country was first settled
and such as is now much to be desired. It was not
an uncommon thing for the early settlers to eut native
hay in the pine forests and fill large government
contracts at the different military posts, As an in-
stance, Fort Whipple, near what is now the Prescott
forest reserve, may be mentioned. Where hundreds
of tons of hay were cut unoer the actual spread of
the forest trees during the sixties and seventies. there

is not now enough grass on a thousand acres to keep

in eandition a family caw. Viore were then running

streucs are now dry arroyos, and where were then
living springs are now beds of silt and sand.”

An examination of the record tends to substantiate
Holsinger’s conclusions. The forest was decidedly
open and parklike. Reproduction was present but
not abundant, and in many areas was markedly de-
ficient. Grass was abundant, but not universal. Wild-
life was probably little if any more plentiful than
today, although some species such as the grizzly bear
and the lobo wolf have long since disappeared from
the state, . =~

The most conspicuous change that has taken place
in inmost parts of the region is the inerease in area
and density of pine repreduction stands (Fig. 1).
Few parts of the southwestern pine region today
lack young trees. Grass density has heen greatly re-
duced, and in some places ground cover vegetation is
virtually absent (Fig. 2). A combination of factors
operating over the past 75 yrs, has brought these
chauges about.

Fic. 1. A typical thieket of 38-yr-old ponderosa pine.
In the densest portion of this stand, there are the equiva-
lent of 10,000 stems per A or more.

Cui atic CHANGE

To evaluate the importance of climatic change, it
is necessary to consider how climate affects the growth
and reproduction of ponderosa pine. Moisture is the
critical factor regulating the distribution of this spe-
cies, and a severe dry peried in the spring of the year
hinders regeneration, In the Southwest, a peculiar
combination of weather conditions must oceur before
seedlings ean beeome established,

According to Maguire (1956), whenever average
monthly temperatures during April and May are con-
siderably above normal, ponderosa pine will flower
in abundance the following spring, with resulting
scone crops in the fall of the next succeeding
r. In the Southwest, good cone crops oecur about
once every 3 or 4 yrs, with a real bumper erop at
irregular intervals (Pearson 1950:111). | Establish-
ment of a reproduction stand requires coincidence
of a good seed crop and favorable growing condi-
tious during the vear or two after germination. Seeds
commonly germinate in July and August, during the
suuimer rains. If the rains are closely spaced, in-
credible numbers of seedlings sometimes germinate.

Fie, 2. A dense cover of mountain muhly (Muhlen-
bergia montana) is characteristic of moderately grazed
pastures such as the one on the right. Overgrazing has
eliminated virtually all herbaceous vegetation on the
left side of the fence.

For instance, in September, 1957, as many as 30. to
40 seedlings per square foot could be counted in parts
of the White Mountains. Ina normal dry spring, no
seedlings of the previous summer's erop will live,
Only in an unusually wet spring can stand establish-
nent be expected,

A peculiar combination of weather conditions, then,
is needed to establish reproduction: a warm spring in
one year, resulting in a heavy seed crop 27 months
lai The sumer and autumn after seed tall must
be wet, and the following spring nist also be wetter
than normal. Such a combination of events in a
semi-arid region can be considered a climatic aect-
dent, rather than a part of the normal weather pat-
tern.

The available weather data from Arizona are of
limited use in assessing lony-terin climatic change
because of the shortness of the record. There was a
severe drought in the last decade of the nineteenth
century, a wet period from about 1904 to 1930, and a
renewed drought since that time. The drought of the
1890's had a marked effeet on the grazing history of
the region, and was apparently severe enough to kill
pine trees near the lower for horder, Plummer
(1904) reported that trees were killed by drought in
the vicinity of Heber and near Blue. There is no evi-,
dence, however, of a recent inajer change in climate,

One of the most publicized sources ef long-term
elinatie data is analysis of tree rings. Tree ring



Page 6:
134

studies in the Southwest have been carefully analyzed
by Schulman (1956), He showed that an irregular
alternation of wet aud dry periods has been char-
acteristic of the entire period of the existing tree ring
record. In the Gila River basin, analyses of more
than 100 trees show that there were marked dry
periods in the years 1800-1825, 1841-1847, 1861-1864,
1871-1904, and 1921-1953. Wetter than usual periods
were characteristic of the years 1826-1840, 1848-1860,
1865-1870, and 1905-1920. His general index for the
entire Colorado River basin, which extends the record
further back in time, shows siuilar irregular fluetua-
tions for about 900 yrs baek from the present. On the
basis of tree-ring chronologies, Schulman (1956 :67)
stated that the current drought in the Gila River basin
is the most severe since the late 1200’s. This drought
is interpreted as having begun in 1921 in some parts
of the basin, in 1934 in others,

Schulman pointed out, however, that his analysis
is based on ring widths measured as a percentage de-
parture from an moving mean, Simall secular changes
in climate may be completely hidden by this moving
mean procedure. Short-term departures (droughts
and wet periods) from the mean are easily detectable,
but longer-term changes in overall elimate would not
he evident from tree ring data,

Hack (1942) studied the evidence for long-term
changes in the enviromuent of the Hopi Indians,
whose home is some 80 mi north of the forest area.
He concluded from the stratigraphy of stabilized and
active dunes that the climate was mueh drier than at
present during the period from about 5000 to 2000
B.C., and that the climate of the first millenium A.D.
was apparently moister than it is today. Stratigraphy
of alluvial sediments in arroyo banks pointed to a
similar conclusion, with a minor wet period between
1300 and 1700 A.D. Antevs (1955) concluded from
geologic and archcologic evidence that there was a
warm peak about 3000 yrs ago, followed by a rather
abrupt decline to the general temperature of the
present. There were severe droughts about 500 B.C.
and 330 A.D.. and during the years 1276-1299 and
1573-1593, Other comparable periods in the past
thousand years have been somewhat wetter than the
present.

On the basis of the rather scanty evidence avail-
able, there seems to be no reason to believe that there
hay been a large-scale climatic change in the past 1000
yrs of a type that would profoundly modify the
character of the pine forest. Certainly there have
been minor fluctuations, from relatively wet to rela-
tively dry. The recent drought began about 1930,
whereas the current overabundance of reproduction
dates from at least a decade earlier.

The question of climatic accidents is less easily
disposed of. There is no way to determine from the
historical record how frequently the peculiar eom-
bination of events necessary to initiate extensive pine
reproduction could have occurred in the past. The

such a combination is entirely a chance occurrence.
Perhaps the 1919 reproduction year of which Pearson
made so much was a highly improbable situation
that could be expected to reeur only once in several
centuries. If so, the present condition of the pine
forest might be ascribed in large part to this single
climatic aceident. It seems likely, though, that simi-
lur accidents have occurred sinee time immenorial.
Climatie change, cither in the form of long term
trends or of an unusual combination of weather con-
ditions in one period of years, does not appear to
offer a satisfactory explanation of changes in the
pine forest.

GRAZING

The overuse and mismanagement which followed
introduction of livestock into the West produced pro-
found changes, some of them permanent, in the plant
cover, Because these changes were conspicuous and
well publicized, the stockiman has been blamed tor
many of the ills of forest land management. Jn
particular, overgrazing has often been assigned as the
primary eause of the overabundanee of young pines.

Utilization of the ranges of uorthern Arizona did
not begin to any great extent until the late 1870's,
Within a few yvenrs after the subjugation of the In-
djans the ranges began to fill up. The Navajo country,
including the pine area on the Defiance Plateau, was
heavily grazed for years before that time. however.
Charles Bent (1851), in a letter written during the
Mexican War estimated that the Navajos possessed
30,000 cattle, 500,000 sheep, and 10,000 horses, mules,
and asses. These figures seem a little high, but that
the Navajos owned extensive herds is attested to by
Lt. Simpson (1850), who wrote from Canyon de
Chelly: “Innumerable signs of stock, principally
sheep, have been seen along the route, and the road
we have been travelling looks as if it might be one
of the great thoroughfares of the nation.” Unlike the
Navajos, the Apaches kept no stock, preferring to
steal animals that their neighbors had raised.

Sheep preceded cattle into most of the Arizona”
mountains. Heavy settlement of northeastern Ari-
zona began about 1876, agd few good locations re-
mained unocenpied by 1880. Sheep outnumbered
cattle by 10 to 1 at this time (Haskett, 1936). As
cattle began to replace sheep, the mountains were
used primarily by stoeckmen who had their head-
quarters in the shortgrass plaims at lower elevations.

Social and economie conditions at that time were
such as to prohibit conservative and intelligent man-
agement of the range, even had the requisite knowl-
edge been available. Cattle prices were too low to”
permit ranchers to do much more than turn their
cattle loose and gather the inerease at periodie in-
tervals. Virtually all the range was vacant and un-
controlled public land. While each outfit had its own
“accustomed range” which was generally recognized,
that range had to be oceupied or someone else would
move his stock in. Thus it became a race to place
cattle on the summer ranges as soon as a spear of
grass appeared, for fear of losing out altogether.

April, 1960

Under such conditions abuse and deterioration of the
range was inevitable. —

By 1889 Farish (1889) could write of the San
Francisco Mountains: “In this mountain range are
found fine valleys, formerly covered with a growth of
wild rye and pea vine, which has been replaced by
other grasses.” Replacement of the better forage
plants had taken no more than a dozen years after
the introduetion of livestock, In 1892 a severe drought —
combined with range depletion to cause heavy stock
losses, which became even worse in 1893. The
Governor of Arizona stated in his annual report: “In
nearly all districts, owing to overstocking, many
weeds have taken the place of the best grasses. In
other places where ten years ago the end of the wet
season would find a rich growth of grass, now it is of
inferior quality, or less quantity, or does not exist
at all.” (Hughes 1893). >

Conditions were probably at their worst by the
turn of the century. Serious concern began to be
felt about the influence of overgrazing on water
supply. The water problem in relation to forests
and forest grazing was made the basis of recommenda-
tions for government action in almost every report
of the Territorial governors from 1893 to 1910, In
the sunmer of 1910, Sam F. Webb, a representative
of the Salt River Valley Water Supply Protective
Association, toured the mountains with Gifford
Pinchot. His report (Webb 1900) gives a good idea
of range conditions in the forest at that time. Speak-
ing of Phoenix Park, between the Mogollon Rim and
the town of Pinedale, he says, “Phoenix Park, which
once elaimed the distinction of being the best and
finest portion of that part of the reserve, when we
were there, had no running water. Its valley had been
ruined by a deep cut or wash draining it so as to
render it uninbabited.” This is still true today.

At about the same time, Plummer (1904), writing
of the present Apache National Forest, reported, “The
entire reserve is a natural range, and grazing has
been the main industry in this and adjacent regions.*
In recent years this industry has suffered greatly
owing to the continued droughts, and the only  re-
maining areas which are used solely for cattle range
are on the Blue and Salt Rivers and Eagle Creek.
The Double Circle Ranch, which used to graze over
100,000 head, has been compelled to gradually de-
erease its herd, until it now numbers not more than
9000. Range for this herd is very limited, and large
areas are now being rented from the Apache In-
dians in the White Mountain Indian Reservation.”

As this last statement implies, conditions were
somewhat better on the Apache Reservation. Webb
(1900) stated, “The White Mountain Indian Reserve
was visited and the parks in it showed no deep ents
or channels to carry the rain water away in torrents.”
Webb attributed this difference entirely to differences
in grazing use. He did not appreciate that the soil
of Phoenix Park is highly erodible when disturbed,
while the basalt soils of the Indian Reservation are
nich less susceptible to erosion (Fletcher & Beutner
WAL).

Sourawesterx Prive Forests since WHITE SETTLEMENT

There is apparently less grass in most of the
mountains of Arizona today than there was at the
coming of the white man, Two factors have tended
to reduce forage production on pine bunchgrass
ranges (Arnold 1950)... Under heavy grazing the
original tall bunchgrasses have been largely replaced
by plants more resistant to grazing, except where
dense tree cover discourages livestock use. In addi-
tion, grass cover decreases as pine reproduction he-
comes established; the greater the density of pine
saplings, the less the total herbaceous cover. De-
cline in total forage production as a result of com-
petition from young pine stands is accompanied by
no great botanical change in the herbaceous vegeta-
tion, but heavy grazing induces a major change in_
species composition. In openings within the forest,
ranges in good to excellent condition near Flagstaff
support a high proportion of midgrasses, dominated
by Arizona fescue, mountain muhly, muttongrass,
and June grass. Under heavy grazing pressure, the
midgrasses are replaced by a shortgrass cover com-
posed largely of blue grama and squirreltail. Under
still more severe use, even these resistant grasses are
largely replaced by less desirable perennial and an-_,
nual forbs (Arnold 1955).

The adverse effects of overgrazing on soil and
water movement have been described se often that
little repetition is needed here. Arnold (1955) re-
ported that of the mountain meadows examined in
northern Arizona, those in excellent condition showed
no gullies. Two of the 13 meadows classed as good
had gullies, but these were less than 2 ft deep. The
degree of gullying increased to the point that of 14
meadows in very poor conditions, 10 had deep gullies
and 2 had shallow gullies. Degree of gullying, how-
ever, is in considerable degree dependent on the erodi-
bility of the soil, Fleteher & Beutner (1941) showed”
that basalt soils were far less crodible than soils
supporting a similar vegetation but derived from sedi-
mentary rocks or granite. This is apparent in the
White Mountains, where severe gullies ravely develop
in the basalt soils, even under heavy range abuse,
although soils derived from other rock types are often
badly eroded.

Browsing by livestoek has had a direct effect on
pine reproduction, particularly in the early days of
heavy grazing. Pearson (1950:157) diseussed in
some detail the relation of regeneration to browsing
animals. Sheep eat both growing shoots and needles,
while cattle normally eat only shoots. This differ-
ence in feeding habits, plus the heavy grazing that
results from the close herding of sheep, makes sheep
more damaging than cattle, In the early years of
this century, many areas were conipletely denuded by
sheep. Webb (1900) reported that south of Springer-~
ville, “From 1875 to 1882 Tranquilino Luna is re-
perted to have had sixty thousand sheep grazing
annually on the Gila Forest reserve, and made Luna
and one or two neighboring localities his lambing
grounds, Since that date but little stock has roamed
over the region. When we were there no grass or
anything (nthe shape of feed except a few scattering

weeds could be seen. The grass roots and seeds have
been destroyed. No young pines of over fifteen years
growth were observed.” Lieberg et al. (1904) also
reported wholesale destruction of small pines by sheep
on the San Francisco Mountain Forest Reserve.

The large reduction in numbers of livestock per-
mitted on national forests, plus the extensive conver-
sion of sheep operations to cattle, have greatly alle-
viated the browsing problem, Localized damage con-
tinues due to livestock concentration, but is relatively
minor, The results of past browsing damage, how-
ever, are clearly apparent in large areas that lack
reproduetion due to past sheep use.

Grazing has been important in redueing the spread
of fire. Large amounts of inflammable grass, which
used to remain on the ground, are now removed by
grazing animals. Many of the early arguments
against reduction of grazing on the national forests
were based on the premise that heavy grazing made
forest fires much less frequent.

It has been widely held that removal of herbaccous
cover and plant litter by grazing animals, and the ex-
posure of mineral seedheds by livesteck trampling
have been important factors in the establishment of
dense pine stands. Pine seeds germinate well under
proper weather conditions on almost any type of
ground cover, but they soon die from desiccation un-
less they become rooted jn mineral soil. In addition,
direct root competition for soil water from the estab-
lished grass cover is considered to inhibit seedling
growth, Rummel (1951) compared Meek’s Table, an
ungrazed mesa in central Washington, with Devil's
Table, a grazed mesa supporting a dense stand of
young ponderosa pine. He coneluded that herbaceous
vegetation as dense as that found on Meek’s Table
definitely inhibited establishment of ponderosa pine
reproduction, His study did not indicate the critical
density of ground cover vegetation whieh would
permit the establishment of either adequate or over-
abundant reproduction. His discussion clearly im-
plies, however, that there is an almost straight-line
relationship between degree of reduction of the virgin
herbaceous stratum and quantity of pine reproduction.
He concluded that heavy grazing is the primary factor
which accounts for the dense reproduction on Devil’s
Table.

In contrast, a much earlier study by Pearson
(1923) in Arizona showed that “competition with
grasses is less disastrous to yellow pine seedlings
than might be expected.” Although grass competi-
tion slowed seedling growth, stand regeneration pro-
ceeded even in the presence of a grass cover. Seed-
lings were severly handieappd in the densest grass
areas, but even here a few were able to establish
themselves.

Nearly 20 yrs later, Pearson (1942 confirmed
earlier findings that dense herbaceous vegetation re-
tards pine reproduction. Grass and other herbascous
plants are able to appropriate most of the moisture in
the upper nine inches of soil at the expense of pine
seedlings. Until they have developed a deep root

system, grass competition puts the young pines at a
disadvantage,

Lavin & Springfield (1955) planted ponderosa
pine seed in a 2-yr-old artificially planted stand of
herbaceous vegetation, of several species and den-
sities, At the end of the seeond season, seedling
survival was inversely related to the total coverage
of the herhaceous plants, but the deerease in  sur-
vival was only moderate as competition increased.
They concluded that, “Although herbaceous vegeta-
tion, seeded and native alike, adversely affects pine
seedling survival, fairly good survival was obtained
in spite of this competition.” Of course, the density
of the reseeded grasses did not approach that of the
natural vegetation that Rummel found on Meek’s
Table.

These stulies show that ground cover vegetation
strongly affects. growth and survival of pine sced-
lings. Most of the studies cited do not devote enough
attention to the unusual weather conditions required
for pine reproduction. In a normal year, most if
not all pine seedlings in a virgin forest will die re-
gardless of competition. In the rare year in which
n wave of seedlings establishes itself, there may be
so much moisture that no degree of herbaceous com-
petition is really inhibitory, Reduction of eompeti-
tion may be a means of encouraging better repro-
duction in managed stands, but under virgin condi-
tions it appears that seedlings could have developed
even in a heavy grass cover. The reduction of grass
Competition and the preparation of a mineral seedbed
by grazing animals probably helped to bring about
the dense thiekets, but do not seem to have been the
controlling factor. There are many severely grazed
openings which remain nearly denuded of vegetation
and in which pine seedlings have not become estab-
lished.

WILDLIFE

The relation of deer to the ponderosa pine forest
has long been a matter of concern. The Kaibab deer
herd has profoundly modified the vegetation of its
range (Rasmussen 1941). As a result of removal of
natural predators and of restriction of hunting, this
herd built up from an estimated 4000 deer in 1906
to nearly 100,000 in 1924. By that time the range
was depleted, there were deaths by the thousand from
malnutrition, and the population dropped precipitous-
ly. Parts of the pine area were so severely browsed
that reproduction was eliminated.

Elsewhere the deer problem has not been so acute.
Pearson (1950) stated that deer eat pine buds early
in spring when elongation begins, and occasionally
they will take shoots that are distinctly woody. Deer
tend to concentrate where use by livestock is light.
On the whole, deer have probably played a relative
small part in recent changes in the pine forest.
Heavy hunting pressure greatly reduced deer popu-
lations in most of Arizona, except ‘the Kaibab Plateau,
during the carly years of this century, and only re-
cently has the deer herd built up to its present level.
Elk, never very common, were quickly exterminated,



Page 9:

and the introduced elk are not numerous enough to
have more than a local effect on vegetation. Obvious
browsing by elk was noted in the upper branches of
small pines after they were cut on experimental plots
near Maverick in November, 1957.

Rodents and other small mammals were considered
very important by Pearson (1950:151). He was
concerned about the use of seeds by mammals, the
girdling or complete cutting of seedlings, and the
removal of bark from larger trees. Taylor & Go: such
(1932) found that birds, ground squirrels, chip-
munks, and mice all ate pine seeds. They concluded,
thougli, that under natural conditions seed-eating
rodents have little or no detrimental effeet on repro-
duction of ponderosa pine. When favorable condi-
tions oceur, seedlings develop in spite of all obstacles.

Keith (1956) made a thorough stndy of the Abert
squirrel, which Pearson classed as one of the most
damaging of animal agents. Keith concluded that
the squirrel is well adjusted to tne elimax forest, and
that it hay very little real effect on the forest as a
whole, There is little basis for assuming that wild
animals have been more than a minor factor in in-
ducing changes in the pine forest in historic times.

Fire

The principal assignment of the early foresters in
the Southwest was, the exclusion of fire from the
woods. They recognized that tires had been frequent,
mul that a surface fire could pass through a ponderosa
pine forest without destroying it, but each such fire
was considered another step contributing to final
destruction. John Wesley Powell (1879) believed
that “The: protection of the forests of the entire Arid
Region of the United States is reduced to one single
problea—Can the forests be saved from fire?”

Reporting on the newly formed San Francisco
Mountain Forest Reserve, Lieberg et al. (1904) wrote:
“ht is very evident that the yellow pine stands, even
When entirely untouched by the ax, do not carry an
average crop of more than 40 per cent. of the timber
they are capable of producing. ... These conditions
are chiefly attributable to the numerous fires which
have swept over the region within the last two hun-
dred years, carrying with them the inevitable conse-
quences of suppression and destruction of seedling
and sapling growth.”

There is little doubt that fires, started by light-
ning or by Indians, were frequent in the pine forest
before the arrival of the white man and in the early
years of settlement. Weaver (195la) analyzed the
fire sears on stump sections collected at various sites
in Arizona. The most frequently burned tree showed
an average interval of 4.8 yrs between fires, while the
longest average interval between fires exhibited by
any sample tree was 11.9 yrs. Weaver's data are
borne out by the results Show & Kotok (1924) ob-
tained in California. They found that during the 200
yrs for which the tree ring record is fairly complete,
25 elearly warked fires were detectable. The average
tire frequency of about S yrs held true for all Cali-

Sourawestern Pine Forests siINcE WHITE SETTLEMENT

fornia areas studied. The shortest interval between
fires was 3 yrs and the longest 11 yrs.

Early visitors to the Southwest apparently took
for granted the frequency of surface tires in the pine
forest. Wheeler (1878) was a few miles north of
Black River on August 27, 1873, when he wrote,
“Here, as has been noticed in several other localities,
the grass on one side of a stream will be new, juicy,
and thin, because of the burning of the sward during
the season, while on the opposite side, where no burn-
ing has taken place, the thick tufts of bunch grass
spreading into beds offer more abundant feed for the
animals that now have to depend upon grass alto-
gether for their support.”

Despite the frequency of surface fires, serious
crown fires were apparently rare. A fairly thorough
search of the early literature failed to turn up a
single report of a crown fire in Arizona before 1900.
A Forest Service report (Drake 1910) on the Coco-
nino National Forest stated that over 80% of the
yellow pine type had been burned over one or more
times, but that the fires usually destroyed only a small
amount of standing timber. Only two burns were
noted which destroyed the stand: one of 7000 A in
spruce about 30 yrs previously, and the other of
3200 A in juniper woodland near Winona. With the
possible exception of a part of the Prescott National
Forest, there appears to be no area in Arizona where
extensive even-aged pole stands indicate that a major
fire destroyed most of the mature timber and per-
mitted extensive even-aged regeneration. There is no
evidence elsewhere of fires of the magnitude of the
Escudilla fire of July, 1951, which destroyed most
of the timber on 19,000 A, or the 21,000 A Dudley
Lake fire of June, 1956.

The situation in California ponderosa pine was
evideutly similar to that in the Southwe: Sudworth
(1897), reporting on the Stanislaus and Lake Tahoe
Forest Reserve, said, “The fires of today are peculiar-
ly of a surface nature, and there is no reason to be-
lieve that any other type of fire has occurred here.
. .. The instances where large timber has been
killed outright by surface tires are comparatively
rare, Two cases only were found, ... One of these
burns involved less than an acre, and the other in-
eluded several hundred acres. They are exceptional
cases, and the killing of the trees is accounted for by
the fact that protection from fire and from alt but
cattle grazing has resulted in the accumulation of
inuch fallen timber, considerable humus in depressions
and on benches, and a dense undergrowth of brush
and seedlings.”

The ceeurrence of forest fires tar back into an-
tiquity was ueted by Holsinger (1902). In Chaco
Canyon, New Mexico, he found that where a deep
arroyo had cut to a depth of 30 ft through a sedi-
mentary formation, distinct strata of earth, impreg-
nated with chareoal, lay about 15 to 20 ft from the
surtace and could be traced over an area of several
thousand acres.

pine were summarized in the detailed study of Show

& Kotok (1924) on the role of fire in the pine forests
of California, They concluded that “The present
California pine { s represent patchy, under-
stocked stands worn down by the attrition of re-
peated light tires... Bach successive fire adds its
often imperceptible weight to the force of attrition
that thins the stand, weeds out the finest individual
trees, and gradually reduces the forest in quantity
and quality te the point where the returns will not
justify the cost of logging.” They reported that each
fire burned down a portion of the mature stand by
enlargement of old fire sears, reduced growth rates
by physically injuring the trees, and rendered them
more susceptible to attack by insects and disease.
Young growth suffered most severely fron tire, The
most conspicuous result of 20 yrs of fire protection
in California was “the enormous number of young
forest trees that have appeared as individuals or as
groups, or in the more virgin stand as a veritable
blanket under the mature timber.” They concluded
that a small amount of reproduction, patchily dis-
tributed, is able to survive ground tires, but most of
the young stand is inevitably wiped out. In conse-
quence, they felt that fire exclusion would permit
nature “to utilize the full growing power of the land,
and to restore the broken and understocked forest to
a nore normal condition.”

Dissenting views were heard even in those days.
The Annual Report of the Secretary of Agriculture
for 1910 said that “The proposal has been made that
the Forests should be burned over every year or two
in order to prevent the accumulation of vegetable
litter on the ground. It has been alleged that the fires
which were set in the early days by the Indians and
the first settlers were beneficial. As a matter of faet,
these early fires were enormously destructive.” (U.S.
Dept. Agr. 1910). This proposal was dismissed out
of hand with the statement, “It is inconceivable that
there should be seriously advocated a treatment of the
forest that would inevitably result in the very rapid
dimunition of its density to the point where ulti-
mately there would be no timber at all.”

Tue INpiaN, Fire, AND THE Forest
There is abundant evidence that Indians were re-
sponsible for many fires. Stevenson (1881) stated
that Indians set fire to the timber on the mountain
ranges of New Mexico each fall in order to drive deer
down into the canyons. John Wesley Powell (1879)
stated that Indians systematically set fire to the forest
for the purpose of driving game. The early pioncers
of Kanab, Utah, saw great clouds of smoke rolling
over the Kaibab Plateau almost continuously from
late spring to early fall. Indians were still killing
white men in those days, so few trips were made to
observe the fires. It was said that Indians chased
deer and other game out on the. points overlooking
the Grand Canyon and then set fires behind them to
concentrate game on the very tips (MeHenry 1935).
On his return from the first ascent of Mt. Baldy,
Wheeler (1878) reported that on the higher reaches
of the Little Colorado, “For a little less than 2 miles

the grass ix of the old erop, then begins the new and
juiey growth of the year subsequent to the burning
over by fires set by Indians.”

Indians had many reasons for setting fires. “The
most potent and powerful weapon in the hands of
these aborigines was the firebrand. It was used alike
to capture the deer, the elk, and the antelope, aud to
vanquish the enemy. It cleared the mountain trail
and destroyed the cover in which their quarry took
refuge.” (Hlolsinger 1902), According to Bell (1870),
“The Apaches also have a very destructive habit
amongst their Jong catalogue of vices of firing the
forests of their enemies.” On his trip through the
Indian reservation, Webb (1900) found fires burning
in two places, which he said were “attributable to the
Indians who believe fire and smoke bring rain.”

Holsinger (1902) was convinced that “These pre-
historic aborigines must have exerted a marked in-
fluence upon the vegetation of the country. Their
fires, and those of the historic races, unquestionably
account for the open condition of the forest, to which
reference has heen made. The high pine forests were
their hunting grounds, and the vast areas of foothills
and platenus, covered with nut- bearing pines, their
harvest fields. . In Arizona you will find no young
forests of any ‘considerable extent antedating a period
of forty years, and almost all of the regrowth has
sprung up within the last quarter of a century.
A single exception ean be noted in the White
Mountains, which have been occupied for a couple
of centuries by the Apache Indians, These forests
show, in certain localities, all classes of regrowth.
and are in marked contrast to the mountain
country oceupied by the Navajo Indians in the north-
eastern portion of the Territory. The Nava,joes lave
possessed sheep and goats and followed pastoal pur-
suits for over two centuries. The forest occupied by
them shows practically no regrowth. The Apches
have followed the chase and war, and have entra n-
meled themselves with nothing but war ponies, The
forests within their domain, where they have not see!

grounded superstition that forest fires cause rain.
show a regrowth gradating into many past decades.”

THE EVIDENCE FROM STAND STRUCTURE
Ares or STUDY

Field work was completed in the summer and fall
of 1957, principally on the Fort Apache and San
Carlos Indian Reservations. These two reservations
lie in east central Arizona, the Fort Apache to the
north and the San Carlos to the south of Black
River. The ponderosa pine forests of the reserva-
tions total about 700,000 acres, mostly on the Fort
Apache.

The study area lies in the White Mountains, which
form the eastern end of the Mogollon Plateau. East
of about longitude 110° and south of the steep
escarpment of the Mogollon Rim, the plateau is
thickly mantled by Tertiary igneous roeks extruded
from the extinct voleanoes that form the heart of
the White Mountains, Lava flows, probably of Quater-



Page 11:

nary age, are superimposed on the older topography
in the valley of White River and elsewhere (Darton
1925).

The topography of this great lava flow is relative-
: gentle for a mountain region. Although it is
isxected by many steep-walled canyons, its general
spect is that of a gent.y rolling plateau. The two
major peaks of the White Mountains, Mount Ord
and Mount Baldy, reach elevations of 10,800 ft and
11.500 ft respectively, but most of the plateau lies
helow 9500 ft.

The basalt lava which overlies most of the White
Morntains is relatively uniform in its composition, as
are the resultant soils. One reason for choosing the
White Mountains as a study area is the uniformity
of its geologic origin, which largely eliminates the
influence of differences in parent material on soil
development and on plant growth.

Intensive field sampling was concentrated in three
The first of these was the old-growth forest
about 10 mi west of Maverick, on the east side of
Odart Mountain. Studies of reproduction stands
were made along Bog Creek, east of MeNary, in an
aren selectively logged in the 1930's, These two loca-
tions are about 40 mi apart airline, at an elevation
nf about 8,000 ft. Soils, climate, and topography are
closely similar at hoth locations, and both are in the
heare of some of the best pine forest in Arizona,

The third sampling area was the relatively un-
touvhed primitive area aroun Malay Gap, in the
extreme northeast corner of the San Carlos [ndian
Reservation, This is perhaps the closest approach
toa truly primeval forest left in the Southwest. Until
the last few years there has been no usable stock
water in the vieinity, so it has been grazed lightly
if at all by domestic stock. Its remoteness and lack
of roads have kept out all but a few visitors, and
until very recently there was no adequate program for
the control of natural fires, Malay Gap lies at an
elevation of about 7,200 ft, and represents a somewhat
less productive site for the growth of pine timber than
the other two locations.

The controlled burning program on the Fort
Apache Reservation gave an opportunity for several
special studies. Sines 1950, more than 150,000 A of
pine forest have been treated with controlled tire,
primarily to reduce tire hazard. Secondary objectives
are partial thinning and praning of sapling stands,
and improvement of forage growth.

These have been extensive, large-seale burns.
Firing is done in Inte fall, after the first of the fall
rains but before the surface litter is too wet to burn.
Buttes and ridges are ignited at the top to permit
the fire to burn slowly and evenly downhill, Roads,
rivers, and openings are used as backstops to re-
strict the aren of the burn, but no effort is made to
limit the fire to small blocks of a few acres.

While the Indian Se foresters feel that in
general these controlled burns have achieved their
objectives, strong dissenting opinions have been
voiced by others who have viewed the results, The
objective of this paper is net to evaluate the manage-

reas,

ment accomplishments or the effectiveness of the pres-
ent controlled burning program, It was possible,
though, to take advantage of some of the treated areas
to study the effects of fire on vegetation and soils.
Although the -planned fires burn later in the year
than the majority of natural fires, the results of the
controlled burns can aid in the interpretation of the
role of natural fires in the forest.

In an uneyen-aged forest with a balanced distribu-
tion of diameter classes, the proportion of trees in
each class remains relatively constant with time. The
diameter distribution usually takes the form of a
falling exponential curve when number of trees in
each class is plotted against d.b.b. On semi-logarith-
mic paper this relationship is a straight line.

The relationship between diameter classes may be
visualized by dividing the number of trees in any one
diameter class by the number in the next larger size
class. In a stable, balanced forest, the resulting
quotient is a constant. This constant may vary
widely from stand to stand, depending upon species
and environmental conditions. This definition of a
balanced forest is called de Liocourt’s Law, from the
French forester who first formulated it (Meyer &
Stevenson 1943).

The structure of the Southwestern ponderosa pine
forest is actually that of an all-aged forest composed
of even-aged groups, but in blocks of several thou-
sand aeres it can be regarded us an uneven-aged
forest. Tree diameters derived, for instance, from a
large scale timber inventory should be distributed
according to de Livcourt’s Law if the forest as a
whole is properly balanced.

A detailed timber inventory of the Maverick
Working Cirele, Fort Apache Indian Reservation, was.
made available by Southwest Lumber Mills, Ine.
This report included stand tables giving the average
nuinber of trees per acre by 2-inch diameter class for
all stands distinctive in character or geographical
location and of significant extent. These tables were
based on data secured in 1951 and 1952 by Hammon,
Jensen & Wallen Mapping and Forestry Services of
Onkland, California. Modern photogrammetric tech-
niques were combined with field data from random
1§ A sample plots to prepare this inventory, A
similar timber inventory, made for the San Carlos.
Apache Tribe by K. B, Woods, Inc., of Portland,
Oregon, was available for the Malay Gap area,

Stand tables computed from 165 survey plots in
the Maverick area and 90 at Malay Gap show that
these old-growth forests do not have the diameter
structure expected in a balanced forest. On the best
sites in the Maverick Unit, numbers of trees per acre
in the diameter classes above 20 in. follow the ex-
pected linear relationship when plotted on semi-log
paper (Fig. 3). The number of trees in the 4-in,
class, the smallest reeognized in the timber inven-
tory, falls on the projected line of the larger trees.

In all size classes between 4 and 20 in. d.b.h., there
are fewer trees than are expeeted on the basis of the
theoretical de Liocourt ratio. The same is true at
Malay Gap. Numbers of trees in the size classes
above 20 in., and in the 4- and 6-in. classes, plot on
a straight line. Intermediate classes are somewhat
deficient, although less so than in the Maverick Unit.
The two lines plotted in Figure 3 are parallel, indi-
eating that the same proportionate relationship be-
tween diameter classes is common to both areas. The
difference in the position of the lines reflects the
lower stand density at Malay Gap.

. AGE CLASS DISTRIBUTIONS

Age data were obtained primarily from increment
cores taken from most of the trees on a square plot
of 10.24 A at Maverick, and on one of 5.12 A at
Malay Gap. Mature trees were also sampled on a
number of random plots established for other pur-
poses. The sample trees were bored to the pith
about 1 ft above the ground, and the cores were aged
according to the methods developed by Dr. A, E.
Douglass and his associates at the University of: Ari-
zona Lahoratory of Tree Ring Research. The dat-
ing procedure is based on visual comparison of wide
and narrow rings. Ring sequences tend to oceur in a
regular pattern, whieh can be used to locate certain
key dates. This system has marked advantages over
direct counting of rings. Both missing rings and dou-
ble rings are common in ponderosa pine, and are apt
to confuse the results of a direct ring count. Errors
are inevitable even with a cross-dating technique, but
the ages reported here are probably correct to within
five years. To the age as determined from the core

nust be added the length of time required for a seed-
ling to grow to a height of 1 ft.

Ages are nich more difficult to determine in a
forest stand than re diameters. The sheer volume
of work involved in boring trees and analyzing cores
makes an extensive age sampling survey impractical.
Ring counts on stumps, althiugh often reported, are
likewise unsatisfactory. Stump counts are ordinarily
possible only on selective loging operations, where
just the largest and least vigorous trees are eut. Even
if all the trees are eut and their rings exposed, field
counting of ponderosn pine rings is highly unreliable.
Ages are best determined by use of accepted cruss-
dating techniques on properly surfaced eores.

An age class distribution could have been derived
by calculating a regression equation relating the ages
of bored trees to their diameters, and then applying
the resulting regression coefficient to the stand table
data from the timber inventory, There is so much
variation in diameter within a single age elass, how-
ever, that such an analysis would be almost meaning-
less. Pearson (1950:39) reported that trees in the
130-yr age class near Flagstaff ranged in diameter
frow 9.7 in. to 40.5 in., while those in the 246-yr
class varied from 14.8 to 46.8 in. d.b.h.

Partial stratification can reduce the variability of
age data. The Maverick timber inventory divided
the trees in each diameter class into a number of
subdivisions according to Keen tree class, a classifica-
tion based on age and vigor of the individual tree.
Four age classes are recognized, from immature trees
to overmature veterans. Within each age class, four
vigor classes are identified, depending upon size and
thriftiness of the crowns. Thus there are a total of
16 possible classes. Trees of the same d.b.h. in a
single Keen class are apt to be more similar in age
than are those in an unstratified sample of the same
size. Therefore, each sample tree bored for total age
was classified according to the Keen system. For
each of the 16 classes, diameter was plotted over age
and a free-hand curve fitted to the points. The data
were too few and too scattered to permit a satisfactory
least-squares equation to be developed, particularly
as the relationships were distinetly curvilinear, On
the basis of the similarity of plotted points, the
separate curves for some of the Keen tree classes
were combined.

The final age-diameter curves were based on 107
trees from the Maverick area. From these curves
and from the inventory stand tables, new stand
tables were constructed for four of the distinct forest
types distinguished by the timber inventory. These
tables show the estimated number of trees and the
basal area per acre contributed by each 20-yr age
class (Fig. 4). Since the timber inventory included
no trees less than 4 in. d.b.h.. and since it takes at
least 20 yrs for the average tree to reach 4 in., the
21- to 40-yr age class is the youngest included in the
computations,

In each of the four age distributions shown in
Figure 4, there is a relative Inek of trees in the 100-
to 120-yr age class, and an apparent overabundance

in some of the older groups. An unbalanced age
distribution is likewise evident on a single 10.24 A
plot at Maverick: (Fig. 5). This single plot was
judged to be representative of the area as a whole,
but it is by no means a random sample.

Just as important as the numerical distribution by
age class is the proportion of the total ground space
occupied by trees of each age elass. At each of a
series of random points at Malay Gap, the nearest
tree in the dominant stand was bored for total age.
The pereentage of the total areca dominated by trees
ot each age class was calculated from 42 sample
points (Fig, 6}. Sapling stands 21 to 40 yrs of age,
and stands aged 100 to 180 yrs control most of the
ground at Malay Gap.

Trees aged from 140 to 200 yrs account for a high

The b: area of the youngest age classes is actually
somewhat higher than that shown in Table 1, sinee

what the same exponential relationship as that postu-
lated. by de Liocourt's for diameter classes.

the 120 yr class. The lack of area balance is evident
in the stands sampled at Malay Gap.

Somewhat similar considerations apply to basal
aren of trees per acre. Lexen (Pearson 1950 :28)
derived the theoretieal stocking density and space
requirement for well-stocked stands of ponderosa
pine. His table shows that fully stocked stands, re-
gardless of the diameter of trees comprising them,
have an average basal area of about 100 sq ft per A.
Basal area in fully stocked stands remains relatively
constant ay the trees grow older, with mortality com-
pensating for growth. It is therefore logical to
assume that in a balanced forest, each age class will
account for an equal percentage of the total basal
area. It is evident from Table 1 that this is not the
case at Maverick.

Structure anp GrowTH of Sapling Stanps

Young ponderosa pine stands of several ages were
sampled at Maverick, at Bog Creek, and at Malay
Gap. Circular plots were measured in fully devel-
oped, more or less uniform patches of reproduction,
with the plot centers so placed that the entire plot fell
within a sapling stand of about the same density
throughout. In no sense was this sampling technique
designed to estimate the average number of trees per
acre on the area as a whole. Rather, it was aimed at
gathering information about the structure and com-
position of the reproduction clumps themselves, The
samples are believed to be representative of a ma-
jority of the pine thickets in the study area.

Plot size, either 40, lie, or Yoo A, was selected
so that there were about 30 to 50 trees on each.
Diameter at breast height of each tree was measured
to the nearest 4o in. On most of the plots, all trees
under about 5 in. d.b.h. and many larger trees were
felled, and a circular cross-section cut as near to the
ground as possible. Increment borings, at about 9 in.
above the ground, were taken from those trees that
remained uncut. On a few plots, only a random
sample of about one-fourth of all the trees was cut
or bored. Only d.b.h. measurements and one or two

ment procedure have been reported elsewhere (Cooper,
in press),

The diameter measurements were used to compute
the stem area of excl stand at the time of sampling
and at several earlier decades. It should be noted
that this stem area was caleulated from measurements
of diameter inside bark near ground level, and it will
be this that is meant whenever the words “stem area”
are used in this paper. Where basal area is re-
ferred to, it will mean basal area calculated in the
conventional manner from measurements of d.b.h.
outside bark. A regression equation calculated from
those stands for which complete data were available
indicates that

B.A. = 1.20 S.A. — 19.9 {1)

where B.A. is basal area in square feet per acre and
S.A. is stem area measured in the sume units. The
standard deviation of the regression coefficient is 0.03.
This equation is applicable to a range of basal area
from about 100 to 300 sq ft per A. A less precise
but more easily interpreted relationship states that
basal area in these stands is 1.09 times stem area.

Obviously, stand data for previous years include
only those trees present in the stand at time of final
sampling, and conclusions about growth or stand
structure specifically exclude any trees that died in
the years between stand initiation and 1957. Total
stand growth per acre in ten years is, of course, the
difference between stem area at any two successive
decades, while mean growth per tree is determined by
dividing total periodic stand growth by the number
of trees contributing to that growth.

DIAMETER CLASS DISTRIBUTIONS IN
EVEN-AGED REPRODUCTION STANDS
Discrete even-aged groups, seldom more than one-

half acre in size, are characteristic of the southwestern
pine forest. In the dry climate of the Southwest, it
is only in oceasional years that seedlings can become
established, so that virtually every tree in a single
elump of sapling or pole size will have germinated in
the same year. Once such an even-aged group de-
velops, it is rarely possible for seedlings of succeed-
ing year classes to become established within it.
Diameter distributions in these even-aged pole stands
may indicate some of the conditions under which the
stands have developed.


Page 15:
April, 1960

Diameter distributions in even-aged forests have
leon studied by Meyer (1930), who fitted several
mathematical series to diameter data. Jones (1945)
suggested that the frequency distribution curve of
diameter classes is of the binomial type, usually
skew. More recently, Prodan (1953) has used the
Charlier A-Funetion to deseribe diameter distribu-
tions. He constructed percentage frequeney distri-
butions of tree diameter, based on 2-em diameter
classes. The maximum percentage frequency, termed
linax, is used to characterize the resulting frequency
eurve. An hiygx of 14 means that 14% of all the
trees in the stand are ineluded in the 2-em class con-
taining the most trees. Prodan presented a series of
tables giving the expected diameter distribution for
each integral value of biyax-

Diameter distributions of several ponderosa pine
stands have been fitted to Prodan’s theoretical values.
Data from 197 trees in an 80-yr-old stand at Cooley
Mountain fit the expected distribution quite closely
(Fig, 7). The diameters of a group of 39-yvr-old
trees at Malay Gap likewise correspond closely to
those predicted by Prodan’s tables. The Cooley
Mountain stand became established and made most of
its early growth before white men came to the South-
west; the Malay Gap stands are in an area still little
influeneed by man.

Fis. 7.) Observed cumulative frequency distribution
of diameters of 107 trees ut Cooley Mountain, compared
with distribution predivted from Prodan’s theoretical re-
lationship.

Diameter distributions of 33 stands sampled at
Maverick and at Bog Creek deviate markedly from
those predicted by Prodan’s tab! In every case
there are more small trees and fewer large ones than
expected. The deviation is least in the 15 stands
dating from the years 1903 to 1914, all of which
were exposed to at least one and perhaps two fires
ata very early age. The 18 younger stands, never
touched by fire, show a greater preponderance of
small trees.

A different approach has been used by Koyama
& Kira (1956) in the study of the frequeney distri-
bution of individual plant weights. They coneluded
from experimental evidence that weights of seeds aud
very young seedlings usually follow a normal distri-

bution. They showed by a mathematical model that
the exponential nature of growth processes can re-
sult in a log-normal distribution of plant weights. A
test of this log-normal hypothesis shows that fre-
quency distributions of basal area in several ponderosa
pine stands rather closely approach a log-normal
form.

Six classes were used for each stand. Class in-
terval was determined by dividing the difference be-
tween the logarithm of basal area of the largest tree
on the plot and that of the smallest by 6. A histo-
gram was constructed. showing the proportion of the
number of stems that fell in each of the six log-basal
area classes.

A logarithmic frequency distribution was caleu-
lated for 197 80-yr-old trees at Cooley Mountain
(Fig. 8). The logarithmic transformation means that
the basal area limits of each class are 1.59 times those
ef the next smaller class (Table 2). The log-basal
area (distribution of the Cooley Mountain stands ap-
proaches the log-normal form, but is skewed toward
the larger size classes. The histogram of the Malay
Gap stands is similar in shape (Fig. 8). By contrast,
the log-basal area histogram of the 1903-1914 Maver-
ick and Bog Creek stands is somewhat skewed toward
the smaller size classes. The younger stands from the
same area show an even greater relative preponder-
ance of trees in the smaller size classes (Fig. 9). -

classes recognizable in one or more of the areas
studied are 1903, 1909, 1923, and 1928. A few small
stands at Bog Creek originated in 1933. Trees of
other ages are rare, and there are no extensive stands
of saplings less than 25 yrs old. In part this is be-
eause there is little roum in the densely stocked old-
growth forest for young trees—the available space
has been pre-empted by the heavy growth of earlier
years. It is evident, though, that weather conditions
in the White Mountains have not been suitable in
recent years for the establishment of ponderosa. pine
reproduction.

RELATION OF MEAN GROWTH PER TREE TO STOCKING

At moderate stocking rates in young stands of
ponderosa pine, mean growth per tree is evidently a
function of available growing space and, perhaps, of
the age of the stand. Age of stand, however, makes
little difference in the amount of stem growth added
at Maverick aud Bog Creek. The stem area growth
on each plot during the decade 1948-1957 was com-
pared with the growth on the same plot in the pre-

vions ten-year period. <A t-test applied to these
paired comparisons showed no statistically significant
difference in growth in the two periods; the computed
value of t was less than one. At least in the age
range from about 20 yrs to 55 yrs, the amount of
stem area growth added by any one stand remains
relatively constant from one decade to the next.

A linear regression equation can be closely fitted
to the mean growth per tree of the Maverick-Bog
Creek stands, if stands of extremely high and low
density are omitted from the calculation, Based upon
25 stands supporting from 480 to 7700 stems per A,

1
g= 0.00309 + 52.6 — (2)
n

where g is mean stem area growth per tree in 10 yrs,
expressed in square feet, and n is number of trees per
acre. Each individual observation used in the calen-
lation of this regression was weighted by the reeipro-
eal of stand density. This reciprocal is of course the
same as available space per tree. The resulting equa-
tion accounts for about 92% of the observed variance
in mean growth.

Stands with more than 7700 stems per A were
omitted from this calculation because it was evident
from the graph of the data that average growth of
very dense stands deviated from a straight line. To
demonstrate this fact, deviations from regression
were computed for each of the 25 stands used in the
original ealeulation, and also for the 6 overstocked
stands omitted from the regression (Fig. 10). It is
clear that as stand density exceeded about 6000 stems
per A, growth deviated more and more from the cal-
culated straight line. This point marked the be-
ginning of stagnation.

There is certainly a minimum stocking rate below
which growth per tree no longer increases. When
the available space per tree exceeds that which the
average tree ean properly exploit, a further increase

in spacing will yield no appreciable additional growth,
Too few stands of very low density were ineluded in
this study to give much information on this point.
It seems, though, that a decrease in stand density be-
low about 450 stems per aere in 35-yr-old stands
does not greatly stimulate growth.

Tnerement cores from several thrifty open-grown
trees were used to estimate maximum growth rates in
the absence of competition, Although mean growth
per tree in moderately stocked stands remains rela-
tively constant from one decade to the next, stem
area growth of open-grown trees is directly propor-
tional to age. Based on 39 observations,

g, = 0.0100 t (3)

where g, is 10-vr growth in square feet and t is age
at the midpoint of the growth period. It is apparent
from plotting of the data that the range or spread of
the observed growth values increases directly with
age, so that the standard deviation of growth is
directly proportional to age, and its variance to the
square of age. It is therefore appropriate in the
fitting of equation (3) to weight each observation by
the square of age. The standard deviation of the
resulting regression coefficient is 0.008.

A tentative iden of the maximum space that can
he utilized by a single tree can be obtained by com-
bining equations (2) and (3). The average age of
the trees used in the caleulation of (2) is 40 yrs,
so that the age at midpoint of the 10-yr growth period
is 35 yrs. It follows from the two equations that a
spacing of about 150 trees per A in a 35-yr-old stand
should yield the same growth per tree as that obtained
from open-grown trees of the same age. Of course,
trees in such an open stand would probably be of
poor form and quality.

TOTAL STEM GROWTH PER ACRE

Total periodic yrowth per acre is closely related
to stocking rate, but the form of the relationship is
more complex than that of individual tree growth.
Total stem area growth inereases with stand density
up to a point, and then deereases as number of trees
per aere exceeds the optimum. A simple graph of
stent area growth over stand density best demonstrates
this relationship (Fig. 11). Growth increases rapid-
ly with stand density up to nbout 4000 stems per
acre, and then decreases slowly as stocking rate con-
tinues to increase. The curve is similar in shape to
that shown by Gaines (1951) for longleaf pine. As
in longleat pine, growth of ponderosa pine stands is
more closely related to number of trees per acre than
to stand basal area.

The total basal area per acre is determined both
by the number of trees per acre and by the age of
the stand. Since basal aren is a joint function of
stand age and density, it is best visualized by plot-
ting basal area over the product of number of trees
per aere times age (nt). The resulting curve has its
maximum at nt = 160,000 (Fig. 12}. Substituting
various values of t and solving gives an indication of
the stand density that will produce the maximum

According to this estimate, maximum basal area will

The maximum basal aren attained by these young
stands is far in excess of the 100 sq ft per A that
Pearson (1950) considered to represent full stocking.
According to the Maverick timber inventory, average
basal area on good sites is slightly more than 100 sq
ft per A. This figure integrates mature groups,
young thickets, and small openings. In small, uni-
form pole stands, basal area can easily reach more

The preceding growth studies have dealt with
all trees in the stand, small as well as large. It is
generally considered that the smaller trees in a stand,
however, have little effeet on the growth of the dom-
inants. It has been almost universally accepted
that as the dominant trees grow up and overtop the
smaller, the losers in the competitive race are sup-
pressed, retarded in their growth, and eventually

eliminated from the stand. Therefore, the smaller
trees are usually thought unimportant by compari-
son with the faster growing dominants and codomi-
nants.

This description of the suppression process is no
doubt valid in those forests where the primary com-
petition is for light. It does not, however, hold true
in the ponderosa pine forests of the Southwest, where
competition is mostly for water. As Pearson (1950)

. has pointed out, sunlight is much less likely to limit
growth of ponderosa pine than is water supply. In
the forests of the humid regions, once a tree is over-
topped it becomes successively less able to secure the
light energy needed for growth; hence it is sup-
pressed and its growth nearly ceases. Where light
is abundant and water is lacking, however, even smal}
trees are usually able to secure their small but pro-
portionate share of available soil moisture, so that the
growth of small trees is not much retarded even by
apparent suppression.

Small ponderosa pines grow slowly from a very
early age, their growth increment remaining nearly

growth pattern. Data for the 5 largest and the 5

1937, and 1927 were grouped for each set, and the
resulting relationship tested for linearity of regression

In neither the large trees nor the small ones was the
departure from linearity greater than would be ex-
pected from chance variation alone (Table 3).

Suppressed and intermediate trees evidently play
a greater role in young ponderosa pine stands than
is eustomarily attributed to small trees. The propor-
tion of total stand basal area contributed by the
smaller trees increases with stand density (Fig. 15).
At low stocking rates, virtually all the basal area of
a stand is contained in the 400 largest trees on each
acre, The proportion of the total contributed by
these larger trees declines as density increases, until
with more than 5000 stems per A only about 17% of
the basal area is due to the 400 largest trees. Ap-
proximately the same relationship applies to total

periodic growth. The larger trees, which are often
the only ones considered in growth analysis, add con-
siderably less to total stand growth in young dense
stands than do the great mass of small trees. The
relative importance in stand growth and use of
available water, nutrients, and light by any single
tree in young ponderosa pine stands is roughly pro-
portional to its size. This is unlike the situation in
nore humid forests where suppressed trees exert
less influence on growth of dominant trees even than
their dimensions would imply.

Coneern has been expressed, by Weaver (1951a)
and others, that the use of soil moisture by developing
pine thickets may adversely affeet the growth of the
mature pine overstory. Several mature pines, more
or less isolated within dense sapling stands, were
exainined at Bog Creek for evidence of this effect.
Mature trees with poor crowns (e.g., Keen tree classes
3C, 3D, and 4C) could be expected to be most affected
by competition from the sapling understory. Inere-
ment borings from 6 such trees showed no unmistak-
able evidence of a change in growth pattern since ori-
gin of the sapling stands. Growth before and after
that time was so slow as to be almost imperceptible.
It may be, however, that the deeline of these deea-
deut trees was hastened by sapling competition.

In contrast to these results, Weaver (1959) has
reported that on the Warm Springs Indian Reserva-
tion in Oregon, thrifty mature trees of Keen class
3B not subjected to understory competition grew
23¢— faster than their counterparts within dense
sapling thickets. Competition from the understory
affected immature pines of Keen class 2B even more
strikingly.

Natural mortality in dense young ponderosa pine
stands is surprisingly low, even among clearly sup-
pressed trees. Examination of fire-killed trees of
known age established that it is easily possible to
identify every tree larger than 0.5 in. d.b.h, that has
died within the past 6 yrs. On all the sample plots
in reproduction stands, a tally of dead trees was
kept (Table 4). Natural mortality of small sup-
pressed trees less than one inch in diameter prob-
ably does not exceed 2% annually; in the larger size

Wi

elugses it is much less. The uncertainty derives from
the fact that there is no way of knowing how many
years’ accumulation of dead trees is ineluded in the
mortality tally. The figure of 6 yrs is no more than
a guess. In this area of slow decay, identifiable dead
trees may last even longer.

GROWTH OF POTENTIAL CROP TREES

The largest trees in the stand will comprise most
of the dominant mature stand and will make up most
of the eventual timber harvest in managed stands.
It is of interest to consider the relationship of the
growth of these dominants to stand density.

Growth of the largest trees in each stand is more
closely related to the logarithm of stand density than
to its reciprocal or to other measures used in the pre-
eeding analyses (Fig. 16). Measurements of trees
on 27 sample plots show that for the 400 largest trees
per A

Bp = 0.34 —0.10 log u (4)

where gy is mean stem growth per tree per deeade in
square feet, and n is number of stems per acre, The
standard deviation of the regression coetticient is
0.033; the computed regression accounts for about
79% of the observed variance in mean growth of the
largest trees.

GROWTH AND NEEDLE WEIGHT OF ENDIVIDUAL TREES

Cable (1958) has shown that there is a logarithmic
relationship between needle weight and diameter of
individual mature ponderosa pine trees in central
Arizona, The relationship of stem area growth to
needle weight in young pine stands was investigated
on two of the 4oo A sample plots at Maverick.

All trees were cut on these two plots, and the
current year’s erop of needles stripped from each tree,
Sampling was done in early November after seasonal
growth was completed. Needles were air-dried with
the aid of a steam radiator, since no oven facilities
were available. Stem area growth during the pre-
ceding ten-year period was determined from stump
sections as before. The trees on one plot were about
49 yrs old; the other plot was aged 30 yrs. The 18
trees on the older plot ranged from 1.0 to 3.8 in.
d.b.h.; the 24 on the younger plot were frum 0.5 to
7.3 in. d.b.b,


Page 20:
148

Stem area growth on these two plots is directly
proportional to needle weight, according to the equa-
tion

(5)

where g is 10-yr stem area growth of a tree in square
feet and W is weight of the current year’s needles
in kilograms. There is no. statistically significant
difference in the regression equations applicable to
the two stands despite their difference in age; hence
the data from all 42 trees were pooled in the caleula-
tion of the final regression equation,

The direct relationship between needle weight and
tree growth is to be expected. for needle weight is a
measure of the quantity of photosynthetic tissue avail-
able for the elaboration of material to be stored as
new wood. There is a definite difference in the weight
of the current year’s needles on the two plots: 1063
kg per A in the older stand, and 787 kg in the younger.
An estimate based on only two trees suggests that
about 406 of the green needles present in November,
after necdle fall ix mostly completed. are of the
current year's erop.

HEIGUT OF DOMINANTS AS A
FUNCTION OF AGE AND STOCKING

Foresters have usually considered that height of
the dominant trees of a given species varies much
less with stand density than do tree diameters; hence
height of dominants in relation to age is frequently
used as a measure of site qualt Lyneh (1958) has
pointed out that in many instanees height growth is
very markedly affected by stand density. He con-
eluded from a review of the literature that retarda-
tion of height growth by density of stocking is most
apparent where root competition is most intense.
Lyneh went on to evaluate the effect of stocking rates
on height of dommants in ponderosa pine stands in
Washington and Idaho. He represented density of
stocking as a proportion of the average density ecal-
culated from all his plot data. He found that tree
heights are reduced ax stocking percentage exceeds
100, and that the effect of stand density on height is
much greater on poor sites than on good.

Lyneh’s method of relating height growth to stand
density is not applicable to the present study, partly
at least because the average stocking rate calculated
from all the sample plots would still represent a
generally overstocked condition. Instead, the mean
height of the two tallest trees on each plot was eon-
sidered as a function of stand age and stocking rate.
For the 29 plots at Maverick and Bog Creek tor which
height measurements were available,

data from which it was derived, this equation indi-
cates that the maximum attainable height of pon-
derosa pine trees at Maverick is 100 ft. Actually,
fully mature dominants reach a height of about 110

ft.

PATTERN
A conspicuous feature of the ponderosa pine
forest ix the grouped arrangement of the trees. It
is obvious that the forest is composed of distinet
groups, cach made up of several trees similar in size
and apparent age (Fig. 17). This faet hax long been

recognized, but surprisingly little attention has been
given to the structure of these groups or to. their
mode of origin.

showing grouped distribution of trees.

An objective stand analysis technique is offered by
the method of contiguous quadrats proposed by Grieg-
Smith (1952). He suggested laying out a grid of 256
contiguous quadrats, and recording the number of
plants falling in each. In analysis of the data, each
pair of adjacent quadrats is combined, creating what
amounts to a new grid of 128 blocks on the same
area. The combining procedure is repeated several
times to give the number of individuals per block
when the blocks consist of 1, 2. 4, 8. 16. 32, 64. and
128 of the original small quadrat units. An analysis
of variance ix then carried out to determine the
variance (mean square) attributable to each of these

block sizes. If the vegetation torms a distinctly
clamped pattern, the variance of the block size cor-
responding to the approximate mean areca of the
ehunp will be much higher than the variance due to
other block sizes.

Testing of the significance of the variance for the
various block sizes presents considerable difficulty.
Grieg-Smith originally suggested using a variance
ratio test to compare the mean square due to various
block sizes with the mean square residual for single
quadrats. Once the fact of non-randomness of vege-
tation is established, however, a variance ratio test is
no longer appropriate. At the present stage of de-
velopment of contiguous quadrat analysis, eonelu-
sions are best based on a subjective interpretation of
peaks in variance. The consistent reenrrence of a
peak at about the same bloek size in a series of
analyses gives a strong indication of its validity
{Thompson 1958).

The theory underlying contiguous quadrat analy-
sis ussumes that the area of the plant is negligible in
relation to the size of the quit This is clearly not
true in ponderosa pine. The use of Moa A quadrats,
however, makes plot size rather large in relation to
all but the largest trees.

Four grids of 256 contiguous “oe A quadrats were
set up at Maverick, and two at Malay Gap. The
largest block size was thus 2.56 A. In analyzing the
pattern of the mature stand, only trees evidently
older than 50 yrs were considered. Most of the six

(C, D, BE. FY.

grids show a pronouneed peak in variance at bloek
sizes of 16 or 32 quadrats (Fig. 18). Several of the
grids also show a high variance at the largest block
size. Little signiiicance can he attached to the latter
peaks because of the small number of degrees of
freedom upon which they are based. There is only
one degree of freedom associated with a block size of
128 quadrats, and two with the next smaller block
size, The large variances at the bigger block sizes may
be due to chance alone, or they may be associated
with a larger seale pattern of vegetation. :

Contiguous quadrat ani indicates that the
trees comprising the muture stand at both Maverick
and Malay Gap are aggregated into groups with an
area of .16 to 32 A. This is consistent with what has
already been observed about the clumped distribution
cf ponderosa pine.

A similar analysis was made of the reproduetion
stand on the same six 2.56 A plots. It seemed in-
advisable, heenuse of the great difference in size of
individuals, to combine beth the mature stand and
yeung trees in a single computation. All trees over
2 in. db. were included in the reproduction tally
(Fig. 19). As in the mature stand, the Malay Gap
grids show a pronounced peak at a block size of 16
to 32 quadrat units. The average clump size of
young trees at Malay Gap is about .16 to 32 4.

The Maverick grids show an evident peak at about
the same hloek size as at Malay Gap. The main
peak, however, is at G4 quadrat units, reflecting the

Forest Coxpitions AT MAVERICK AND AT Mavay Gap
Although similar in basic composition and struc-
ture, the forests at Maverick and at Malay Gap are
quite different in appearance. A visitor to Malay
Gap, conditioned by acquaintance with the over-dense
thickets characteristic of most of the Southwestern
pine region, ix immediately struck by the open nature
of the forest (Fig. 20). The forest floor is carpeted
with a deep layer of grass, and small discrete patches
of young trees are dispersed among groups of stately
pines. The pure beauty of the Malay Gap region
more than compensates for its difficulty of access.

The site at Malay Gap is clearly not as good as that
at Maverick. The average height of mature domi-
nants at Malay Gap is about 95 ft, while those at

Maverick average about 110 ft. The height of dom-
inants in sapling stands averages 10 to 12 ft less than
in stands of comparable age and stocking density at
Maverick, According to the Malay Gap timber in-
ventory, the rage basal area of the mature stand is
about 70 sq ft per A on the most densely stocked
$200 A. By contrast, the mean basal area of the
13,000 A timber type including all the Maverick study
plots is about 102 square feet per acre. The differ-
ence reflects inherent differences in site productivity,

Until recently, lack of adequate transportation
has prevented an effective fire control program at
Malay Gap. Weaver (1951n) found from analysis
of fire sears that fires had swept across Malay Gap in
1943, 19 1919, 1910, and about every 7 yrs before
that time. Fire scars on living trees indicate that at
least the last two fires were very extensive and covered
most of the area. By contrast, the areas studied at
Maverick and Bog Creek have either been free of fire
since stand origin, or have been protected since a fire
in 1924. Differences in site quality and in fire his-
tory are the primary differences between Maver ck and
Malay Gap. To determine how cach of these factors
has affected stand structure, it is necessary to examine
some of the eeological effects of fire in ponderosa pine.

Fire iy tHe Ecorocy or Poxperosa Pine

A number of recent studies on the relation of
fire to ponderosa pine have been reported by Harold
Weaver. On the Colville Indian Reservation in cast-
ern Washington, he examined a group of 40-vr-old
pine stands. One portion of the study area was
burned by a wildfire in September, 1914, when the
young pines were about 1] yrs old; the other portion
had been protected from fire throughout its life.
Thirty vears later, the unburned area was covered by
a stagnated stand of saplings so thick in places us to
be almost impenctrable. There was an average of
14,800 stems per A on plots in the unburned area,
with a mean d.b.h. of 1.7 inches and a height of 12.3
ft. Stand density in the stocked portion of the fire-
thinned area was 1100 stems per A, the trees averag-
ing 7.4 in. in diameter and 32.2 ft in height. Only
about 9% of the burned area was stocked, the result
of a hot fire burning out of control (Weaver 1947).
In the Southwest, exclusion of fire has likewise in-
duced the formation of dense thickets which give
every impression of near stagnation (Weaver 1951a}-.

As a consequence of long continued fire exclusion,
fire hazard has built up until the stage is set for a
devastating conflagration (Weaver 1951a, 1955). The
dense reproduction stands are themselves highly in-
flammable. A heavy needle mat has aceumulated. and
snags and dead wood have added fuel. Without
periodic fires to remove this debris a little at u time,
it has built up to a point where any fire is liable to
race uncontrolled through the treetops. Weaver be-
Heves this inerease in fire hazard to be the most po-
tentially dangerous change that has oceurred since
early days.

In June, 1936, a spark from a logging operation



Page 23:
April, 1960

set off a fire that ran out of control through 21,000
A of ponderosa pine forest north of the Mogollon
Rim. The behavior of the fire and the meteorological
conditions accompanying it were analyzed by Schaefer
(1957). He deseribed the Dudley Lake fire as a
classic example of a fire accelerated by local air
subsidence and a low-level jet current. The hot, dry
winds resulting from these unusual conditions lead to
an explosive situation in which even the most modern
fire fighting equipment is ineffectual once a conflagra-
tion gets under way. Yet it is possible to argue that
the Dudley Lake fire would not have killed virtually
every tree that it touched had not the forest fuel
been allowed to acenmulate for 40 yrs and more.
Surely loeal air subsidence and jet streams have re-
curred throughout history, but there is no clear evi-
dence of ‘past holocausts of the magnitude of Dudley
Lake in the ponderosa pine forest. The Dudley Lake
fire was touched off by logging and not by lightning;
but there is no reason to doubt that Indians built
campfires in the woods even In the hot, dry days of
June,

Preliminary test of prescribed burning in Arizona
(Weaver 1952) showed that lighter fuels such as
fallen needles, branches, and cones were reduced ap-
proximately 55% by weight, while the eubie foot
volume of logs and stumps declined 64% to 80%.
Four years later, though, the quantity of fuel on the
ground equalled that before burning (unpublished
data on file at Fort Apache Agency, Whiteriver, Ari-
zona), Part of this inerease i tributable to the
fact that 30 vrs of tire exclusion prior to the experi-
mental burns had allowed an abnormal number of
live needles to remain on the lower portions of the
tree crowns. Light tires which do not ignite the
crown generally singe the lower needles, which then
tall from the tree. The height of the needle scorch
resulting froma low intensity tire is a function of the
initial vegetation temperature and of the height of
the flames above the greund (Byram 1958). Live
needles extended to within a few feet of the ground
on the Fort Apache experimental burning plots; these
needles were singed by the tire, fell to the ground, and
added their bulk to the quantity of fuel on the forest
floor after the prescribed burn, A second fire might
produce a more long-lasting fuel reduction.

This burning experiment evaluated only the effects
of fire on dry fuel lying on the gronnd., Of equal im-
portance is the effect of repeated tires on the hagards
represented by sapling stands, which are highly sub-
ject to destruction by crown fires. Crown fires are
of two types: dependent, which require heat from
surface fuels to preheat and ignite the crown, and
independent, in which the tire travels directly from
erown to crown without aid from surface fuel com-
bustion. Most crown fires observed in the Southwest
on relatively level ground are dependent. The tikeli-
hood of crown ignition resulting from a surface fire
is u function of the height of the base of the crown
above the flames. If. for instance, there are no needles
below the 12-ft level, the crowns of a sapling stand

SourHWESTERN Pine Forests since WHITE SETTLEMENT

151

are much less likely to be ignited by a surface fire
than if the crown level is at a height of 6 ft. The
quantitative effects on fire spread and severity of the
raising of crown level are not known, but they are
evidently considerable. It is well known that the in-
tensity of radiated heat. varies as the square of the
distance from the source. In a surface fire in a sap-
ling stand, though, this relation is greatly compli-
eated by heat convection.

If a crown fire should start in a sapling stand,
it is not apt to run as far or as fast if some of the
fuel has been removed as in a solid stand of dense
saplings.’ Experience on the Fort Apache Reserva-
tion has demonstrated that it is easier to fight a wild-
fire in an area previously treated with controlled fire
than in untreated areas. In summary, long con-
tinued tire exelusion has increased the danger of de-
structive wildfires in three ways: by permitting ex-
cessive buildup of dry fuel on the forest floor, by
leaving the tree crown level near the ground where
ignition of live needles is more likely, and by per-
mitting the formation of dense uninterrupted sapling
stands over wide areas.

Stanp SrrRucTURE aT MAVERICK anp aT Manay Gap

The young trees at Malay Gap are arranged much
more definitely in groups than at Maverick, and only
rarely do they grow under or very close to the trees of
the mature stand. On only 10 of 512 quadrats were
young trees more than one inch in diameter found
growing on the same “ov A plot as a mature tree,
By contrast, 84 out of 1024 similar quadrats at Maver-
ick had reproduction and mature trees growing on
the same plot. The association of mature trees with
young trees was tested tor both stands, using a chi-
square test on a 2 by 2 contingency table. Chi-square
values for hoth the Maverick and the Malay Gap
tables were highly significant, indicating a strong
tendency for reproduction and mature trees not to
be associated on the same quadrat. Chi-square valnes
were much larger, however, for the Malay Gap tables
than for the Maverick data, Only ¢ larger than 1
in, db.h. were considered in this an There arv
mminy stunted and suppressed tr 2 to 6 ft tall
growing under the mature overs at Maverick.
Most of these trees are at lea yrs old, and some
are more than 30, Trees of this type are almost totally
lacking under the Malay Gap overstory.

The lack of trees under the mature stand is evi-
dently the result both of competition and of the
periodic fires that have swept the Malay Gap area.
Kven under the open canopy of a mature forest,
seedlings grow poorly (Fig. 21). Though the trees
remain alive, they are stunted and unhealthy, Root
competition, rather than conipetition for light, is
apparently the governing factor. Root grafts between
adjacent trees of the mature stand may play a part,
although there seem to have been no studies of this
subject in ponderosa pine, Yli- Vakkuri (1954) found
that in even-aged stands of Seotch pine in Finland,
many middle-aged trees had root grafts with the root
systems of neighboring trees. Sometimes a network of



Page 24:
152

10 or more trees is formed by grafting, and water and
nutrients are transferred through grafts from one tree
to another. Jt is possible that there is a similar inter-
connection of the root systems of a mature even-
aged group of ponderosa pines. If so, the united
“root systems may ramity so ¢ompletely through the
soi] that newly established trees are unable to com-
pete effectively.

trees is less than 3 ft high.

When a light surface fire passes through the forest,
the stunted trees growing beneath the pine overstory
are too small and weak to withstand its effeets. A fire
intensity that would injure a thrifty sapling little if
at all is often fatal to a suppressed tree of the same
age, More important, though, is the effect of needle
fall from the mature stand. A considerable volume
of light fuel rapidly builds up beneath the mature
stand. When ignited, this fuel generates enough heat
to kill any young trees which may be growing in its
nidst. By contrast, the lesser fuel accumulation in
openings makes a less intense fire which saplings are
able to survive. Evidence for this differential removal
of trees under the forest canopy is provided by many
observations on the controlled burns on the Fort
Apache Indian Reservation. Virtually every seedling
and sapling beneath mature trees is killed by the con-
trolled burns, while nearby reproduction stands re-
main almost intact.

The failure of reproduction te survive under the
mature canopy in the presence of fire largely accounts
for the difference in pattern of smaller trees between
Maverick and Malay Gap. Contiguous quadrat analy-
sis demonstrated the existence of definite reprodue-
tien groups, 16 to 32 A in size, at Malay Gap. At
Maverick, on the other hand, stunted reproduction is
widespread beneath the mature trees, becoming much
more vigorous in the openings (Fig. 22). This ae-
counts for the peaks at two block sizes in the mean
square diagram of Figure 18.

It has been asserted that the small trees growing
under the mature overstory represent valuable ad-
vance reproduction which will greatly speed up stand
regeneration following timber harvest. Actually, it

is doubtful if these stunted trees will respond to re-
lease at all. Establishment of seedlings some 6 or 8
yrs before cutting the mature trees, if possible, is
almost certainly good forest practiec. but the stunted
little trees 20 and 30 yrs old that often grow in the
shade of the mature stand are probably more of a
hindrance than a help to future forest growth.

There are many more trees per acre, particularly
in the smaller size classes, at Maverick than at Malay
Gap. On the 2.56 A plots at Maverick, there are
almust twice as many trees in each of the size classes
from 1 to 8 in, d.b.h. as on comparable plots at
Malay Gap (Table 5). The numbers of trees larger
than 9 in. are much more nearly equal on the two
sets of plots, the slightly larger number at Maverick
closely reflecting better site quality.

Although the small plots in reproduction stands

the average number of trees per acre on the Maverick-

and Bog Creek plots have a much higher proportion
of small trees than those from Malay Gap. The
Malay Gap plots have the most trees in the largest
size class, despite the definitely poorer site.

The densest stand sampled at Bog Creek had the
equivalent of 14,400 stems per A in a 38-yr-old stand.
The average density of seven 1919 stands at Bog
Creek was almost 9000 stems per A. This figure is
probably more or less representative of the mean den-
sity of pine thickets in the White Mountains. A
series of twelve 2.5-A plots established in connection
with the Fort Apache controlled burning program
earried an average of 4855 trees less than 3.5 in.
d.b.h. per A (unpublished data on file at Fort Apache
Agency, Whiteriver, Arizona). These 12 plots were
in a stand of ponderosa pine logged in 1924, and in-
eluded the usual mixture of openings, reserved tree
groups, and pine thickets common to cutover areas,
It is likely that stand density on that part of these
plots actually stoeked with reproduction would ap-
proach the 9000 per A found on the Bog Creek plots.

Sapling stands of 1919 age support more trees
per acre than do younger plots that would normally
be expected to carry more trees (Table 6). Evidently
couditions in later years did not permit as high a
percentage of seedling survival as in 1919. At any
rate, the average stand density on 9 sample plots in
1928 stands at Bog Crevk is 4867 trees per A, about
halt that on the 1919 plots.

Fire Errects ox Saphixg Staxps

Mueh of the differenee between the virgin area
and the managed forest is due tu the fires that have
continued at Malay Gap, Natural surface fires have
long been a part of the environment of the pine
forest. What has been the role of these natural fires
in the development of the forest? Equally important,
what has been the effeet on stand structure of forty
years and more of fire exelusion ?

A partial answer to these questions might be of-
fered by an analysis of the results of the Fort Apache
controlled burning program, but these burns have
deen carried out in stands that are no longer normal.
Forty years of complete protection from tire have
perniitted the development of thickets with an abnor-
mal number af trees per acre and an abnormal ae-
cunation of fuel. A surface fire run through sueh
a thicket is much different in its effeets than if the
stand has heen burned at frequent intervals through-
ont its life.

Other prescribed burning experiments are slightly
more informative. A 20-A tract of overstocked pon-
derosa pine thickets in north-central Washington was
treated with controlled fire in 1942, and the results
evaluated in 1950 (Morris & Mowat 1958). Future
crop trees, those that are likely to constitute the
mature stand of the future, were selected on the basis
of size and vigor. The crop trees on the burned area
grew 36% more in diameter and 7% more in height
than those on the unburned plots, while the number
of trees that offered significant competition to the
selected trees was reduced from 2,410 to 895 per A.
The authors concluded that preseribed fire, properly
applied, can reduce competition among trees in dense
ponderosa pine thickets and increase the growth of
potential crop trees. The thinning was not uniform
or selective, and occasionally destroyed all saplings
in some poorly stocked portions of the stand.

The effects of natural fires on reproduction stands
were studied at Malay Gap. Recorded fires have
passed through that area at least 3 times in the life-
time of the present sapling stands: in 1919, in 1935,
and in 1943. More recently, the B.S. Gap Fire of
September, 1956, covered several hundred aeres in
the same area. This was a moderate surface fire
apparently typieal of those that have oceurred many
times in the past. The aren burned faced to the
north, on about a 15% slope. Weather records from
Maverick Lookout, 8 mi northwest at about the same
elevation, show that relative humidity was low and
temperature high in the days preceding the fire. The
fire danger rating, a numerical value that integrates
fuel moisture, humidity, temperature, and wind, was
almost as high in the three days preceeding the fire as
at the peak of the spring dry period. The B.S. Gap
fire burned under severe, if not extreme, fire hazard
conditions.

When the fire area was examined in September,
1957, the seorched needles, although brown and dry,
still remained on the trees. It was thus possible to
assess the amount of direct damage to tree crowns.
Completely dead trees were also easy to detect.
Lynch (1959) has reported on a study of mortality
following ttre in a 30- to 40-yr-old stand of ponterosa
pine in eastern Washington. He found that mortality
was correlated with degree of crown damage and with
tree size. Most of the mortality oeeurred in the first
year following fire, and most of the first-year mor-
tality was caused by crown burning. There wns sig-



Page 26:

nificant mortality the second year as well, mostly due
to direct damage to the cambium.

The trees examined after the B.S. Gap fire had
gone through only one growing season sinee the fire.
Some additional mortality is to be expected, but the
first-vear effects will give a strong indication of the
action of a natural fire on pine reproduction stands.

A large proportion of the trees less than one inch
in diameter was killed by the fire. There were fewer
of these small trees to begin with than on comparable
plots in the unburned forest at Maverick and Bog
Creek, und fewer still survived the 1956 fire. A pro-
gressively smaller proportion of trees was killed in
each Jarger diameter class, Only 189% of the very
stall trees survived, whereas 84% of the stems in the
4- to G-in. class remained and no trees over 8 in. d.b.b.
died on any of the plots in the first year following the
fire. No trees larger than 14 in. d.b.h. were observed
to have been killed anywhere in the fire area, The
first vear effect of the B.S. Gap fire on the reprodue-
tion stand is expressed by the equation

P = 0.61 — 0.66 log D (7)

where P is the proportion of the total number of trees
of a given size killed by the fire, and D is d.b.h. in
inches. This equation is of course strictly applicable
only to this one five, While the absolute number of
saplings killed may vary from fire to fire, somewhat
the same proportionate relationship between size
elasses can be expected to be maintained,

The B.S. Gap fire removed about one-fourth of
the hasal area of reproduction stands. The relation-
ship between basal area of 15 sampled stands hefore
and after the fire is

B,=0.77 B, (8)
where By is stand basal avea one year after the fire
and B, is basal area before the fire. The standard
deviation of the regression evefficient is 0.065. The
average basal area found from the 15 plots was 96
sg ft per A before the fire and 76 afterwards. Once
again, these figures do not purport to represent the
average basal area of the forest as a whole, but rather
that of homogeneous clumps of reproduction.

The 1943 fire at Malay Gap reduced several repre-
sentative sapling stands to a total basal area of 40 to
80 sq ft per A, ax revenled by analysis of stump
sections. Fourteen years later the basal area of each
of these stands had approximately doubled.

MECHANISM OF THINNING BY FIRE

The differential killing of the smaller stems by fire
constitutes a fairly effective thinning from below,
which removes many of the small trees that lose out
in the race for dominance. In the absence of fire,
suppressed saplings tend to hang on and on, each
taking at least a small portion of soil moisture at the
expense of the dominants.

Natural fires thin sapling stands in three ways.
Oceasionally the surface fire becomes so hot at the
base of a tree that the cambium is killed and the tree
girdled. As far as could be told from a superficial

Cuarues F, Coorer

Kealogien! Monosraphs

Vol, 30. No. 2
field examination, none of the trees on the B.S. Gap
tire plots were killed in this way. A certain amount
of mortality from this cause may be expected in the
second year, however (Lynch 1959).

A second and much more common effect is the
thinning of stands by the raising of their crown level.
On most of the burned plots at Malay Gap there was
a definite zone of scorched needles killed by the heat
of the surface fire. Above the scorch line there was
little if any needle damage. Obviously, if a sup-
pressed sapling is 10 ft tall and a surface fire kills
all needles below the 12-ft level, the small sapling’s
chanees of survival are slim indeed. Most natural
fires oceur at a season when xetive growth is taking
place, or at least when bud dormancy is not fully
established. Under these conditions, heat generally
kills buds ax well as foliage.

Ou 10 of the 145 burned plots there was a notice-
able raising of the crown level. In one stand with an
average height of 27 ft, a crown level formerly at a
height of 16 ft was raised to 24 ft. On the other
plots, a smaller proportion of the live crown was
scorched.

The periodie raising of the erawn level and the
killing of Jower branches by fire aids in the natural
pruning of ponderosa pine. This species prunes
itself rather poorly, and lower branches tend to re-
main alive even in dense stands. Fire may be an im-
portant agent in the production of clean-boled trees,
not so much by actual combustion of lower branches
as by killing them so they fall naturally.

A third form of thinning is the killing of trees
by the beat of a fiercely burning log or stump. The
trees for several feet in every direction are frequently
killed and small openings formed in this way. Such
openings are seldom large enough to be detrimental
to the growth of the stand. Roots of the surrounding
trees quickly appropriate the vacant soil space and
growth of the remaining trees may be stimulated.

Only rarely will local crowning of a general sur-
face fire destroy a whole patch of young trees. Ou
the B.S. Gap fire uo stands were found that had been
completely killed, although some were thinned too
severely. There is evidence elsewhere at Malay Gap,
however, of a number of appurently thrifty repro-
duction stands that have been totally wiped out, evi-
dently by the fire of 1943,

It seems clear that a fire ean and does pass through
an established reproduction stand without destroying
it. How, though, is it possible for a stand to become
established in the face of repeated fires? Seedlings
a foot or two high are extremely sensitive to fire, and
even up to a height of six feet or more, it is doubtful
if a young tree can withscand a surface fire of normal
intensity,

Apparently they do hot have to. In the normal
forest there are many openings in which seedlings
become established. There is little accumulation of
pine needles or other dry material to carry a fire
through these openings. The seedling stand itself
does not produce enough dry material to carry a sur-

face fire until it is about 8 yrs old, Even then, there
is usually only enough fuel to support a light and
spotty fire.

Evidence for this hypothesis is hard to find be-
enuse of the scarcity of very young pine stands.
There are almost no extensive stands of waist-high
trees suitable either for experimental burning or for
observations of the results of past burns, except for
a few small patches on Horse Mesa, east of White-
river,

Horse Mesa was treated with controlled fire in the
fall of 1954, 3 yrs before the examination. Six oo
A plots were examined (Table 7), Trees on 5 plots
were 1] yrs old at the time of the fire, and on one
they were 5 yrs of age. The 5-yr-old stand and one
of the Ll-yr-old stands were not touched at all, even
though the fire reached to within 50 to 100 ft in every
direction, The obvious reason was lack of sufficient
fuel. There was not inuch grass in the shade of the
little trees, and they had dropped few dry needles.
The slight fuel accumulation under the other 11-yr-
old stands was sufficient to support only a relatively
cool fire, This tire eliminated a greater proportion of
the stems on the more densely stocked plots than on
those that were more open, but the trees killed were
mostly in the smaller size classes. The denser stands
evidently produced a greater volume of needles which
generated a locally hotter fire than that in the more
open stands. The least dense of the 11-yr-old sample
plots had so little fnel on the ground that fire did not
spread to it at all, Any thinning would have left this
plot seriously understocked,

Intensity of fire in very young stands sens to
be sort of self-regulating feedback mechanism that
provides the needed degree of thinning. Where there
are many trees per aere, the volume of dry fuel builds
up faster and to greater quantities than where trees
are sparse. The greater fuel accwnulation in turn
supports a hotter fire that thins the stand in propor-
tion to the fire’s heat. As in older reproduction stands,
it is chiefly the smaller trees that are removed by fire
—alinost no trees in the largest size classes were killed
on the Horse Mesa plots.

Ear_y GROWTH OF THE Present Mature Stanp

One of the more significant problems to be con-
sidered in evaluating changes in forest conditions
over the past century is the early growth of those
trees that comprise the present mature stand. The
growth pattern of these trees was presumably gov-
erned in their sapling stage by the same factors that
control the growth of young stands today.

Growth of 104 trees more than 100 yrs old on the
Maverick plots was analyzed from inerement cores.
From each core, 2 tree diameters were derived, one
at about 25 yrs of age and the other just 20 yrs
later. These diameters were used to compute the
stem aren growth during a 20-yr period in the early
life of each tree. A 20-yr period was chosen to mini-
mize the effects of brief chance variations in weather.
It has already been demonstrated that in the age
range from 20 to 55 yrs, stem area growth in a single
tree remains relatively constant from one decade to
the next. It is therefore legitimate to divide the
calculated 20-yr growth by 2 to estimate the mean 10-
yr growth during the early life of the present mature
stand.

This estimated 10-yr early growth of the 104 ma-
ture trees wag compared with the graph of growth of
the largest trees in the present day sapling stands
(Fig. 16). Two assumptions were involved here:
that the trees now comprising the mature overstory
were the largest, dominant trees in the stand when
they were saplings; and that the same factors that
now govern the growth of dominant trees in sapting:
stands were operative a century and more ago. From
the relation between tree growth and stand deusity
given by Figure 16, an estinate was made of the
probable stand density under which each of the ma-
ture trees must have grown when it was about 35 yrs
of age. The estimated past stand densities of the
present mature stand were compiled in a histogram
(Fig. 23}. More than 23% of the trees examined
exhibited an carly growth pattern comparable to that
now shown by trees growing in stands with less than
1000 stems per A. More than half of the present
mature stand apparently grew up in stands with fewer
than 3000 trees per A at 35 yrs of age.

The early growth of 104 trees from the

mature stand at Maverick was used to estimate the

stocking deusity unter which these trees may have

grown in their early years.

Fig. 23.

One of several questionable assumptions in this
analysis is the conclusion that all of the present ma-
ture stand developed from trees that were large dom-
inants in the sapling stands of their youth. Some
of the present overstory trees have, on the contrary,
rather obviously been more or less suppressed all their
lives. It is not uncommon to find 6- or 8-in. trees
that are 150 yrs or more old. Several such were in-
eluded in the Maverick growth analysis. Besides the
trees used in the construction of Fig. 23, there were 18
additional trees whose early growth was so small as
to indicate that they grew up under a stocking rate
far in excess of 15,000 stems per A. This is surely
improbable. It is more likely that these 18 trees were
small intermediate or codominant trees in their sap-
ling days.

All that Figure 23 suggests with any degree of
certainty is that the early growth of a large propor-
tion of the trees that make up the present mature
stand was greater than the comparable growth of
most saplings today. The implication is very strong
that most of the Maverick overstory began its life
under conditions of stocking considerably less dense
than those found in the area today.

Sapuing Stanps aT MAVERICK AND Matay GaP

Because of the marked difference in site quality
and stand character between Maverick and Malay
Gap, it is not legitimate to compare directly the
growth of trees on the two areas. Fewer stands were
sampled for complete growth data at Malay Gap than
at Maverick.

The average growth of the largest trees in the
Malay Gap sapling stands is much less than that of
trees in stands of comparable density at Maverick.

Cuarves F, Cooper

Erologicn! Monographs
Vol, 10, No, 2
Measured stem area growth of dominants at Malay
Gap is only about two-thirds that predicted from
equation (4) and Figure 16. The lower site quality
at Malay Gap accounts in part for this difference.
More important, though, is the faet that the Maverick
growth equation defines growth in sapling stands of
wholly different character than those at Malay Gap.
The Maverick equation related growth to stand
density in stands whose structure has been determined
almost wholly by biological factors of intraspecitic
competition. These stands have a high proportion oi
small trees, whereas the fire-thinned stands at Malay
Gap tend to have fewer but larger trees. It has heen
shown (Cooper, in press) that instantaneous growth
rates in ponderosa pine stands are more closely related
to summned tree diameters per acre than to basal area
or to number of trees per acre, This is logieal when
it is considered that tree diameter is almost dircetly
proportional to the surface area of the cambium.

Beeause the Malay Gap stands contain fewer very
small trees than those of comparable age at Maverick,
the summed tree diameters in stands of a given density
are greater at Malay Gap than at Maverick. This
means that the influence on stand growth of a given
number of trees per aere is greater at Malay Gap
than in the Maverick stands. Therefore, even aside
from site quality, it is to be expected that individual
tree growth would be less in stands of a specified
density at Malay Gap than at Maverick.

It is likewise not legitimate to compare the total
periodic basal area growth per acre of the two sets
of stands. The basal area of the Malay Gap stands
was sharply but temporarily reduced during the
1948-1957 deeade by the fire of 1943. This fact.
combined with the known site differences, makes a
direct comparison of basal area growth meaningless.

Definite conelusions can, however, be drawn about
the diameter distributions and the comparative stand
densities in the two areas. The differences in diameter
distributions in sapling stands at Maverick and Malay
Gap have already heen discussed in some detail.
Differential removal of smaller stems by fire is plainly
the mechanism whieh produced the Malay Gap diam-
eter distributions. The 1909 stands at Maverick
were all exposed to at least one fire early in their life-
time. This fire removed some of the surplus smaller
stems, and initiated a change toward a diameter dis-
tribution of the type found at Malay Gap. These
stands were fully protected after the age of 15,
though, while the comparable stands at Malay Gap
were being burned twiee more. The sapling stands
whose distributions are most strongly skewed toward
the small trees are those young ones never exposed
to fire. Those most strongly skewed toward the large
end of the distribution are the Malay Gap and the
much older Cooley Mountain stands, all often sub-
jected to surface fires. Intermediate in diameter
distribution are the once-burned 1909 stands at Mav-
erick.

Diameter distributions at earlier ten-year intervals
were derived for several stands from measurements

of stump sections and inerement cores, The shape of
the logarithmic basal area histogram changes very
little in the interval from about 20 to 40 yrs total age.
Variations in shape of the histograms in Figures 8
and 9 seem to be attributable chiefly to environ-
inental factors rather than to normal ehanges in diam-
eter distribution accompanying stand maturity.

Another striking difference between Maverick and
Malay Gap is in the average density of reproduction
stands. The comparative figures of Table 6 are
prebably representative of the difference in the two
areas. Nowhere at Malay Gap are there impenetrable
pine thickets of the type so common elsewhere (Fig.
24). A reasonable effort was made to include in the
sumpling program the densest stands observed at
Malay Gap. The most densely stocked M400 A that
met the other sampling requirements of homogeneity
coud stand uniformity had the equivalent of 4960 trees
per A.

The lower stand density and the greater relative
number of trees in the larger size classes means that
the mean growth per tree is greater in the fire-
thinned stands at Malay Gap than in stands of com-
parable age in other areas. The stands at Malay
Gap appear more healthy, more open, and are com-
posed of fewer but larger trees than at Maverick
(Fig. 25).

It is clearly apparent that reproduction stands are
sinalley in extent at Malay Gap thin elsewhere in the
Arizona pine region, Yet, a survey showed that one-
fourth of the ground area there was occupied by
stands less than 40 vrs of age (Fig. 6), This is surely
a normal proportion in a forest of long-lived trees.

Tue ORIN oF PATTERN aNb STRUCTURE

AGE AND DIAMETER STRUCTURE

An important characteristic of the old-growth
forests of the White Mountains is their unbalanced
age and size class distributions, There is an over-
abundance of young trees less than 6 in, d.bJi. and
many darge nutture and overmature pines. The inter-

mediate age and size classes are obviously deficient.
The missing classes coincide in general with the
period of first settlement of the Southwest, and it
has been suggested that the early pioneers were re-
sponsible for the present lack of intermediate aged
stands. It has been reported that the early settlers
were particularly careless with fire, or perhaps set
fire to the woods deliberately to improve forage con-
ditions. An abnormal increase in the incidence of
man-eaused fires in the last half of the 19th century
is sometimes assigned as the cause of the relative lack
of small sawlog trees in the ponderosa pine forest.
The fact that the same unbalanced age distribu-
tion oceurs in the largely undisturbed forest at Malay
Gap argues against this hypothesis, Furthermore,
there is little evidence that the early pioneers were
particularly free in their use of fire in the woods.
Joe Pearce, a long-time resident of Eagar, Arizona,
who was employed ax the first ranger on the Black
Mesa Forest Reserve at the time of its establish-
ment in 1898, reported (personal interview, 1957)
that his principle duty in those days was firefighting.
He had little trouble enlisting the aid of cattlemen
in fighting fire on their own range, for they were
constantly apprehensive about the loss of forage.
In contrast to the situation in California, there ap-
parently was little organized burning of the woods
by white settlers at any time in the last century.
The primary cause for the lack of intermediate
aged trees appears to be the infrequent occurrence
of the peculiar sequence of weather conditions neces-
sary for establishment of reproduetion. There is a
large class throughout the White Mountains that ap-
parently dates from about 1839, Most of these 120-
yr-old trees are now from 16 to 24 in. db. There
are definite age that originated about 1875,
about 1890, and possibly in other years; but on the
whole there was Ittle regeneration between 1839 and

1909, Many of the present small pole stands started
in 1909, and were followed by the extensive 1919
class.

Several older classes ean be clearly distiuguished.
Many trees became established in 1820 and others
about 1795, A surprising number of the very large

1685.

The importance of the 1919 age class has heen
stressed repeatedly, and perhaps overemphasized, by
many foresters. It is almost wholly lacking in the
Maverick area, however. Fire sears on trees in the
1909 pole stands show that the area was burned
early in the growing season of 1924, when the 1919
pines were 5 yrs old. If any substantial number of
seedlings beeame established in 1919, they inust have
heen killed by the 1924 fire. It is possible that there
was a complete local failure of reproduction at Maver-
ick in 1919. This hypothesis is made plausible by
the apparent searcity of 1919 trees over many square
miles, and their relative rarity at Malay Gap. A
number of stands that appeared to date from 1919
were sampled, but all turned out to be somewhat
younger. Dense pine thickets originating in 1923 and
1928 are as conspicuous in the Maverick region as
are the 1919 thiekets elsewhere. For the last 25 yrs
or so there has been virtually complete failure of pine
regeneration throughout the White Mountains.

The age and diameter structure of the forest as a
whole is governed by the periodicity of reproduction.
A particularly favorable combination of weather
conditions has permitted stand regeneration only in
occasional years, These waves of reproduction have
come at irregular and unpredictable intervals, and
have resulted in an irregular and unbalanced forest
structure.

PATTERN

The patchwork pattern of the ponderosa pine
forest is the expression of a eyelical process of com-
munity development, governed by fire and by the in-
tolerant nature of the species. The basic outlines of
this process have been presented by Weaver (1943).
Watt (1947) has analyzed the theoretical implica-
tions of cyclical development in the plant community.
It remains to bring these concepts together into a
unified hypothesis on the origin and development of
pattern in the southwestern pine forest.

The intolerance of ponderosa pine to shade is re-
sponsible for the formation of the even-aged groups
of which the forest is composed. Even-aged forests
are typical of intolerant species in general, for the
young trees grow hest when not subjected to shade
from the mature canopy. The relatively small size of
the even-aged groups in the southwestern forest is due
to the small size of the openings in which the groups
can become established.

As the stand matures, the identity of the groups
is maintained by fire. In an opening, a stand of
young trees is partially protected by the lack of fuel
on the forest floor. In contrast, the ground beneath
a group of mature trees is generally covered by a
layer of inflammable material. Seedlings that ger-
minate beneath the overstory are rapidly eliminated
by the first fire that passes through the stand.

Fire is thus the force that here counteracts the
inevitable tendeney of plants to take on a random dis-

tribution, Since the seeds ef ponderosa pine are
widely and more or less uniformly distributed
throughout the entire forest, the stand should in time
take on a purely random pattern, the pattern of a
theoretical all-aged forest with trees of every age
oceurring in every portion of the stand. Some ex-
ternal influence must be present to overcome the
natural tendency for pattern formations to byeak
down and for the vegetation to be distributed ran-
domly. Natural fires impress upon the forest the
gvouped pattern so characteristic of ponderosa pine,
and act to maintain that pattern through time.

Watt (1947) has suggested that most plant com-
tunities exhibit a cycle of change divisible into two
parts: an upgrade, when the net quantity of plant
material is increasing; and a downgrade, characterized
by dispersion of material and the breakup of the
community, The upgrade portion of the eycle starts
slowly, accelerates, and then slows down as the com-
munity reaches maturity; the downgrade portion of
the curve is precipitous.

A reconstruction of the history of one small area
of about %4 A at Maverick illustrates the evelical
pattern of development and breakdown through
whieh the pine forest has passed. This particular
quarter-acre is oceupied by a dense stand of young
pines that originated in 1928, Towering above them
are two old veterans, one 34 in. and the other 35 in.
d.b.h. Two standing snags, 4 fallen logs, and a
burned stump testify that the two big trees are the
last survivors of a disintegrating group. Close by in
all directions are thrifty pole stands dating from
1909.

The group of large pines, which began ta grow
about 1715, was apparently still intact in 1909, and
then consisted of about 10 mature trees. When the
1909 stands established themselves, seedlings germi-
nated beneath the mature canopy, but grew poorly be-
eause of root competition. The first fire that came
through the area—in 1924 if not before—killed them
all because of their small size and because of the
quantity of surface fuel laid down by the overstory
pines, Adjacent young stands in openings survived,
to produce the thrifty pole stands visible today.

Meantime, the mature stand was starting to break
up. One of the old trees must have been dead by
1924, as shown by the burned stump. After main-
taining its integrity for more than 200 yrs, the group
apparently disintegrated in 20 yrs or less. IJnter-
connection of the root systems by root grafts may
have had something to do with the rapid deteriora-
tion of the stand once disease or old age got a foot-
hold. With all but 2 or 3 of the former dominant
group gone, conditions by 1928 were suitable for re-
establishment and survival of a new young stand.
The 1924 fire removed most of the surface litter and
exposed a good seedbed. There was no longer a
heavy needle fall from the mature overstory, nor did
the feeble survivors offer intense root competition to
the developing young stand. Thus a new eycie was
initiated, to repeat itself as before. Under natural


Page 31:
Ayeil, 1960

renditions, the new young stand will throughout its
lite maintain its integrity as a homogeneous even-
aged group, Root competition combined with -elee-
tive removal of small stems hy fire will ensure that
trees of younger ages cannot successfully become
tablished within the even-aged group.

Grounp Cover VEGETATION

The composition and quantity of the herbaceous
sround cover in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests
in the result of the interaction of at least three fac-
tors: grazing, fire, and the density of the forest
eainopy. The relationship of fire to ground cover
vegetation has been intensively studied in the pine
regions of southeastern United States, where pre-
seribed) burning is widely employed to control un-
able hardwoods. The situation in the South-
st is somewhat different, for here there is no evi-
dent successional trend leading to replacement of pine
by other species.

No detailed studies have been made of the
effects of fire on subordinate vegetation in the South-
west, Weaver (1951b) concluded that properly eon-
ducted preserihed burning does not seriously damage
perennial bunehgrass cover under ponderosa pine.
In fact, it appears beneficial through partial opening
of the reproduetion stand and removal of dense
needle mats. He considered the same to be true
where periodic surtace fires have continued.

The herbaceous cover at Malay Gap was the only
ground cover vegetation that was analyzed in  de-
tail in the present study. The Malay Gap aren is
especially interesting in that livestock have been
virtually exeluded, and the ground cover approximates
to some degree that of pre-white man days. The
district is an important wintering ground for the elk
that mave down from the high country to the east,
so it can by no means be considered entirely un-

grazed,

The ground cover at Malay Gap is composed al-
most wholly of a dense stand of serewleat mubly
(Maklenbergia virescens), A tew other gi and
forbs are present, but in most places more than D0C
ot the volume of herbaceous cover consists of the
one species of Maddenbergia. Other species present
are Blepharonenron tricole pis, Sitanion hystric, Pani-
com bulbosum, Stipa pringlei, Poa fendleri, and Koe-
feria cristata, Ou dry exposed slopes, Muhlenbergia
rigens, M. lougiligele, and Ceanothus fendleri  be-
come more abundant. It is clearly noticeable that
forbs of all kinds are much searcer at Malay Gap
than on most comparable sites on the Fort Apache
Reservation and adjacent national forests. This
difference is almost surely due to differences in graz-
ing histery.

The grass cover at Malay Gap is as dense as is te
be found anywhere in the southwestern pine zone.
Grass production was mated by harvesting all of
the current year's crop \Wwithin a rectangular wire
trame 9.6 sq ft in area. The weight in grams of the
grass from one such plot, multiplied by 10, estimates

LSSeS,

grass production in lbs per A. The estimated weight
of the current year’s forage production in openings
at Malay Cap was 1620 Ibs per A. The standard
error of the mean of this estimate is 108.5 lbs. While
plant species other than screwleaf mubly were en-
countered on most of the plots, they occurred in such
siuall quantities that it was impractical to segregate
them.

The volume of the herbaceous ground cover is
much greater in -the open than under the forest can-
opy (Fig. .26). Ground vegetation. was harvested
from plots undér several degrees of tree cover. Per-
centage of crown cover was estimated at each sam-
pling point by means of the spherical densiometer
described by Lemmon (1956). Seven such points
were sampled, Based on 20 separate 9.6 sq ft plots
from these 7 points,

V=1600—21 C (9)

where V is herbaceous cover in pounds per acre and
C is percentage of crown cover, expressed as a whole
number. The standard deviation of the regression
coefficient is 2.5. This equation states that forage
production declines about 21 Ibs per A for each 1%
increase in crown cover. If projected far enough.
the equation indicates no herbaceous vegetation at
erown densities above about 75%. This is essentially

correct, for there is little such vegetation beneath very
dense pine stands.

groups at Malay Gap. Note the virtual absence of grass

No detailed analysis of fire effeets on grass cover
was made. Observations on the B.S. Gap fire indi-
eate that about 10°% to 15% of the grass plants were
dead a year following the tire. This fire burned at
the very end of the growing season, when grasses
were nearly dormant, although serewleaf muhly re-
mains partially green all winter. Dead grass plants
were clearly evident in the adjacent unburned area as
well, so that many of the dead clumps observed on
the B.S. Gap tire might have been due to natural
mortality. Few grass seedlings were present. While
grass growth was vigorous on the burn, it was notice-
ably less so than on the adjacent unburned area.

Errects or Fire ox Sots

The effects of fire on soils and on watershed con-
dition have long been a matter of concern. The
Annual Report of the Superintendent of the Fort
Apache Agency diseussed a series of severe fires that
took place in the summer of 1904. “These fires were
high in the mountains and far from the Ageney or
Indian homes, and in places almost inaccessible.
There was not much damage to the large timber, but
the younger growth was almost destroyed. The
greatest damage, however, was the burning of the
great beds of leaves that conserve or hold the water
on the mountain sides. The effect was seen in the
great floods that came last winter from the continued
rains and the deep snow.” (Crouse 1905). Yet, as
has already been noted, tires were frequent in the
White Mountains for many years before 1904, and
accelerated erosion was not severe over must of the
area at the turn of the century.

Detailed studies of soil conditions following fire
in the White Mountains have been reported else-
where (Cooper, in press). Under most conditions, a
protective layer of duff remained on the forest floor
following burning. ‘Soil movement was measurably
increased on steep slopes after fire, but the slopes
rapidly stabilized und little of the eroded material
actually reached stream channels. Soil erosion fol-
lowing light to moderate fires cannot be considered
serious on the basalt soils of the White Mountains.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Cuances Since Wuire SerrLement

The coming of the white man to the Southwest
brought many new factors to disturb the ecological
balanee of the region. Most important were the
attempted exclusion of fire from forests and ranges,
and introduction of domestic livestock. Both have
eontributed to changes in the Southwestern pine
forests during the last three-quarters of a century,
but of the two, protection of the forests from fire has
had the greatest effect.

Natural surface fires were the agent which normal-
ly thinned young stands of pine reproduction—some-
times too much, sometimes not enough, but on the
whole in such a manner as to insure continuous growth
of the forest. The pattern of the forest, a pattern of
an all-aged stand made up of even-aged groups, was
largely maintained by fire.

Fires were started by lightning and by Indians.
It is impossible to determine the proportion caused
by each. Northern Arizona is an area of extremely
high lightning incidence; anthropological studies attest
to the role of historic Indians in setting fires. It is
likely that prehistoric Indians, who have occupied
the region for at least 10,000 yrs, were equally free
in their use of fire. It is probable that genetic and
evolutionary processes, operating over that length of
time, would have brought the ponderosa pine forest
into balance with the existing fire regime. The ar-
rival of the Indians may have intensified the extent

Cuarzes F, Coorer

Eroloxicnl Monographs
Vol. § 0 2

of fire in the forest, but lightning fires were prevalent
long before.

When the white man brought his cattle and his
fire-fighting crews to the Southwest, the forest began
to change. Grazing altered both the composition
and the quantity of ground cover vegetation. Re-
moval of herbaccous competition and exposure of
mineral soil by livestock helped prepare the ground
for dense thickets of pine reproduction. Abundant
reproduction would have become established in any
case, however, for its principal cause was an un-
usually favorable series of weather conditions.

With few fires to thin dense stands of voung
pine, they svon grew into almost impenetrable sap-
ling thickets. Man's attempted exclusion of fire
without the substitution of some other agent to thin
sapling stands and to remove excess fuel has created
a condition of near stagnation and of fire hazard that
presages no good for the forests of the Southwest.

IMPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT

This study was planned as an investigation of the
ecological effects of natural fires in the ponderosa
pine forests of Arizona. It was not intended as an
evaluation of the controlled burning program being
carried out on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation,
nor as a study in applied forest management. Never-
theless, no one interested in forest management can
avoid drawing some conclusions after intensive effort
on a problem of this kind.

Early students suggested that repeated fires were
permitting the ponderosa pine forests to produee no
more than 40% of their potential growth. It is clear
that growth of the primeval pine forests did not reach
the maximum potential productivity of the site.
Natural fires thinned some sapling stands too severely,
and killed an occasional large tree in its prime.
Growth surely exceeded 40% of the potential, though;
it was perhaps nearer 80%. Under present policies
of complete exclusion of fire from most of the forests
of the Southwest, growth of young stands hag actually
declined.

Whether the trend toward excessively dense pine
thickets, with their accompanying problems of stag-
nation, can be reversed and the forest returned to
anything like its original condition by the use of
prescribed fire is questionable. Forty years of fire
protection have perhaps allowed the situation to get
beyond control, The pine thickets have grown up to
a point that a planned burn is apt either to destroy
the whole stand or to do little in the way of needed
thinning. It may be that only in newly established
stands originating after timber harvest can the silvi-
cultural possibilities of planned fire be fully realized.

Three conclusions seem plain from this study. The
first is that some practical and eeonomie means must
be found for thinning young pine stands and for
reducing the amount of hazardous fuels. At the
dense stocking rates characteristic of most of the pine
thickets in northern Arizona, virtual stagnation is
setting in. The fire hazard is likewise building up


Page 33:
April, 1960

to dangerous levels. The projected pulp industry in
Arizona, often held out as a panacea for all the ills
of forest management, will do little to remedy the
situation, The stands in most urgent need of thin-
ning are those well below pulpwood size. If fire is
not to be the tool to do this needed job, some other
efficient and inexpensive means must be found to thin
the stands and remove surplus fuel.

Secondly, if fire is to he used as a management tool
in the ponderosa pine forest, some modifications will
have to he made in the present system of marking
trees for harvest. The improvement selection method
used in the Southwest removes high-risk trees and
larger dominants where ever found, favoring the
growth of smaller clean-boled trees. If applied over
several cutting cyeles, this system will eventually
convert the forest to a true all-aged condition, with
trees of every age on every small unit of the stand. If
the natural even-aged group pattern of the forest is
thus broken up, it will be impossible to employ tire as
a management tool. Seedlings under the cover of a
mature tree canopy cannot withstand a fire, natural
or planned. Only if the normal group pattern is
maintained, permitting seedlings to grow in open-
ings, ean reproduction be secured. Some version of
the group selection system, now being tested in Idaho
ponderosa pine stands (Curtis & Wilson 1958), will
be necessary to assure regeneration if fire is to be
used as a management tool.

Finally, it must be recognized that small trees in
and beneath an even-aged stand are not only not desir-
able, but are often a positive hindrance to growth. In
most cases it is impractical in the Southwest to at-
tempt to establish advance reproduction many years
before harvest of the mature stand. The statement
of Gaines et al. (1958) that in the experimental burns
on the Fort Apache Reservation, “Few seedlings less
than 3 or 4 feet tall survived on cither burned area.
is technically aecurate but highly misleading. Alinast
without exeeption these 3 and 4 ft “seedlings” were
no less than 25 yrs old at the time of the fire, Re-
moval of these stunted trees represents a gain to
forest management, and not a loss as they imply.

The ponderosa pine forest found by the first
white men originated under the influence of tire, and
was fully attuned to fire as a part of its natural en-
vironment. Forty vears of fire exclusion has induced
profound and detrimental changes in the growth and
structure of the managed forests of the Southwest.

SUMMARY

The late settlement of the region makes northern
Arizona particularly suitable for a study of vegeta-
tian change resulting from man’s use of the land.
Changes in the ponderosa pine forests of southwestern
United States have been studied through analysis of
the historical evidence and of the structure of the pres-
ent forest: stand,

Reports of early visitors indicate that the forest
was originally mere open than it is today. Dense
thiekets of- young ponderosa pine have covered much

of the region in the last half century. Accompanying
the increase in young pines has been a decrease in
grass cover and a shift in the botanical composition
of the herbaceous vegetation. Accelerated erosion has
removed the surface soil tayers and induced forma-
tion of gullies in some places.

Long term climatic changes do not appear to be a
major factor contributing to these changes, nor do
the effeets of wild animals. Some of the change in
herbaceous vegetation is the result of excessive use
by domestic livestock, but much is directly due to the
increasing density of the pine overstory. Livestock
have initiated some of the increase in pine reproduction
by reducing grass competition and by exposing a min-
eral seedbed that makes seedling establishnient easier.

The most important change brought about by the
white man has been the virtual exelusion of fire from
the forests of the Southwest. Under natural condi-
tions, light surface fires, set by lightning or by In-
dians, burned through all parts of the pine forest at
regular intervals of 3 to 10 yrs. These fires acted as
natural thinning agents and reduced surplus fuel.
The reduetion of inflammable grass by grazing ani-
mals, and an intensive fire prevention program have
largely eliminated fire from the woods, The major
cause of the present excess of pine reproduction is
exclusion of fire.

Stand structure was studied in two areas typical
of the ponderosa pine forests in most of the South-
west, and at the primitive aren at Malay Gap, where
livestock have been excluded and natural fires have
continued. In all the old-growth stands examined,
there are fewer trees in the intermediate size classes,
from 8 to 20 in. d.b.l., than would be expected from
theoretical relations between size classes. There are
fewer trees in the age classes from 80 to 120 vrs than
expected. In young even-aged stands, diameter dis-
tributions are skewed toward the smaller trees in
stands never exposed to fire. In stands frequently
burned during their development, diameter distribu-
tions approach a log-normal form, and conform to
theoretical distributions that have been fitted to even-
aged stands elsewhere.

Mean growth per tree in even-aged reproduction
stands is a linear function of available space per tree.
From age 20 to 55 yrs, mean growth per tree in any
one stand remains relatively constant from one deeade
to the next. Apparent stagnation begins as stand
density exceeds about 6000 stems per A, 150 to 450
trees per A vield maximum growth per tree. Total
basal area growth per acre increases with stand den-
sity, then decreases as stocking exceeds 4000 trees per

Since competition is mostly for water, not light,
the normal suppression pattern characteristic of
humid forests does not occur in southwestern pon-
derosa pine. Small trees continue to grow at a con-
stant slow rate, and suppressed and intermediate trees
in the aggregate play a greater role than is usually
attributed to them, Natnral mortality is low in stands
unaffected by fire,



Page 34:
162

Growth of potential crop trees is a linear fune-
tion of the logarithm of stand density. Stem area
growth of an individual tree is directly proportional
to the weight of the current year's needles. Height
of dominant saplings is related to stocking and age
of stands ax well as to site index.

The pattern of matare stands and of reproduction
stands was analyzed with a grid of contiguous quad-

rats, Trees are aggregated into even-aged clumps
averaging 16 to 32 A in size. The pattern of re-

production in unburned stands is Jess distinet: than
that of the mature stand, or of the reproduetion in
frequently burned stands at Malay Gap.

The stand at Malay Gap is much more open than
that in the unburned aren at Maverick, with more
grass in the intervals hetween the trees. The site is
not as good at Malay Gap as at Maverick, but the
difference in stand canditions is primarily due to the
frequent fires which have continued at Malay Gap, and
to differences in grazing history, Simall saplings are
rare beneath the mature canopy at Malay Gap. They
have been removed by surface fires supported hy fuel
dropped by the mature stand. Reproduction at Malay
Gap is successful only in openings where there is little
fuel. There are any more trees per acre in repro-
duction stands at Maverick than at Malay Gap.
Stocking at Malay Gap, however, is fully adequate to
assure a future timber crop.

The effects of a recent natural fire were studied
at Malay Gap. Only 189 of the trees less than J
in. db.h. survived the fire. Survival in the 4- to
G-in. class was 549%, and no trees over § in. d.b.h.
were killed. Natural fires thin sapling stands in
three ways: by direct heat damage to the cambium of
individual trees, by general raising of the crown level,
and by creation of openings around burning logs and
stumps. In very young stands, there is rarely enough
fuel to carry a fire until the trees are 6 or 8 yrs old.
The density of the sapling stand in part regulates
the quantity of dry needles and the intensity of the
resulting surface fire, Fire thinning of sapling stands
is a sort of self-regulating feedback mechanism in
which the degree of thinning is governed by stand
density.

Analysis of early growth of trees comprising the
present mature stand at Maverick showed that their
growth in the sapling stage was greater than that of
most trees of comparable age in present young stands.
The implication is that the older trees began their
life in relatively open sapling stands.

The unbalanced size and age class distribution in
old-growth stands is due chiefly to the rarity of the
peculiar set of weather conditions needed for stand
establishment. Trees of only a few distinct age
classes are present, and failure of reproduction over
a long period in the last century accounts for the
relative lack of 8- to 20-in, frees. ;

The clumped pattern of ponderosa pine is the re-
sult of a cyclical pattern of community development,
governed by fire and by the intolerant nature of the

species. Fire is the force that counteracts the tend-
ency of trees to take on a random distribution.

The composition and quantity of the herbaceous
ground cover is governed by grazing, tire, and. the
density of the forest eanopy. Little serious erosion
can be noted following light surface fires.

It ix doubtful if, after 40 vrs of protection, use of
preseribed fire ean now reverse the trend toward ex-
cessively dense pine thickets. Silvieultural  possi-
bilities of planned fire can probably only be realized
in young: stands originating after timber harvest.
Some practieal and economic ineans must he found for
thinning young pine stands and for reducing the
amount of hazardous fuel. If fire ix to be this means,
modifications will have to be made in the present
method ef marking trees for harvest, which is rapidly
converting the even-aged groups into a true all-aged

s In general, smal] trees in and beneath an
zed group are not only not desirable, but are
often a hindrance in managed forests.

The ponderosa pine forests of the Southwest
evolved under the influence of: natural fires. Man's
attempted exclusion of fire and introduction of live-
stock has induced marked changes in the vegetation
of the region.
