Research and Development - 2018 Fail & Summer Fleid Season
Overview
By ERI R&D Stat

ERI's 2018 held season included several new and continuing forest restoration
and tuel management studies across Anzona and southwestern Colorado. With
support and partnership trom the Forest Service. Bureau of Land Management,
and Fort Lewis College. ERI crews collected held data lor projects spanning a
range of forest types. Continuing work from 2017, crews spent the summer
remeasunng long-term monitoring plots on a landscape- scale study on Grand
Canyon-Parashant National Monument. Plots installed in the mid-1990s were
remeasured 10 evaluate responses ol overstory Irees, regeneration, fuels. and
understory plant communities to restoration trealments. In another project
simular Jorest structure and vegetation data were collected trom a restoration
study inated in 2003 in warm-dry mixed-conifer Jorests of the San Juan
National Forest. CO. In central Anzona. crews conducted tield measurements
to investigate ecological responses, mastication (vegetation chipping and
grinding), and other tuel reduction treatments in transitional ponderosa pine—
intenor chaparral ecosystems on the Prescott and Tonto national forests. Lastly,
near Flagstaft, hield crews revisited long-term studies on the Ft. Valley
Experimental Fores! and assisted Knsty Baker in data collection for her

ER! Science Delivery and Outreach News:
By Dr. Amy Waltz. Director of Science Delivery

We are committed to assessing the lates! science needs and communicating
primary restoration science to our land management partners to better meet
forest management goals. The fallowing are highlights across this broad
program af work

West-Wide.ERI stat! are working with the US Forest Service Washington Office
and other research partners to update and revise the national set of indicators
for the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration (CFLR) Project's 10-year
report. The CFLR projects are currently funded by a 10-year act that closes in
2019. Although the 23 CFLR projects are different in scale and partners. a set
of standardized indicators was developed in 2011 1o measure progress across
the act's five objectives. Key outcomes include better understanding of
successes and lessons learned in the largest landscape expenment of
collaborative forest restoration. More information can be found here.

Ragional and Forest Projects. The Frye Fire burned a large proportion of Mt
Graham on the Coronado National Forest in 2017. The landscape experienced
a vanely of fire mtensies. The ERI had a small restoration demo in a dry
mixed-coniter forest on the mountain. including a set of 10 plots and a 3-acre
stem map. In 2018, we remeasured these plots and stem map, and are
currently analyzing the data to descnbe in more detail the ire effects on a small
Portion of the dry mixed-conifer forest. Results will be available in the spring of
2019.
