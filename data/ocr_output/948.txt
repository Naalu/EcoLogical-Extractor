Restoration Benefits of Re-Entry with Resource Objective
Wildfire

A study published in Forest Ecology and Management by ERI researchers,
lested whether restoration objectives in ponderosa pine forests were being mel
incrementally by allowing repeated. low-severity wildhires to re-bum siles
Findings showed that areas with wo fire entries were not noticeably different in
lerms of forest structure and fuels from areas experiencing only one tire
Findings trom this study suggest that managing for more moderale-severity
burning can help achieve some restoration objectives more quickly than using
repealed entnes of low-sevenly tire
