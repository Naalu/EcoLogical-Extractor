Twenty Years of Research Data Informs Landscape-
Scale Restoration

In 1995, the Ecological Restoration Institute al Northern Anzona University and
the Bureau of Land Management. Anzona Stnp District. formed a partnership to
address concerns about the potential for large. catastrophic wildhre and loss of
cniical ecosystem services in ponderosa pine forests of Grand Canyon National
Monument The ERI established a large array of long-term monitoring plots to
sludy ecosystem responses and effectiveness of restoration on about 4.000
acres Researchers measured key indicalor vanables related lo forest

slructure, vegelation. and hazardous tuels prior to implementing restoralion
lreatments that included tree thinning and prescribed fire Following trealments,

researchers periodically re-measured monitoring plots and documented results

To date. more than 75 scientiic publications have been produced trom this,
project, providing invaluable information tor landscape-scale restoration
planning and adaptive management

This year, the ERI received tunding from the BLM to re-measure the key
indicator variables across the plot array on the GCNM landscape a lull 20 years
atter the restoration trealments were implemented. This work will support long-
term monitoring of restoration treatment effectiveness and ecosystem
conditions at the landscape scale The ERI will use plot data trom the 2017-
2019 measurements to examine 20-year Ireatment etlectiveness as well as
long-term clmate-treatment interachons, Cala and maps produced will assist
the BLM in planning activities and adaptive management over the nex! decade.
(ntormation gathered from this project will be particularly important to managers
1n the Southwest, who must understand long-term effects ol treatments
implemented at large scales and how they relate to stand-level treatments

Research and Development — 2017 Summer Field Season
Overview
By ERI R&D Stat

The 2017 teld season included new research studies as well as re-
Measurement of long-term projects. In partnership with the U.S. Forest Service,
Bureau of Land Management and National Park Service, ERI crews collected
data on three projects. The first began in mid-May with the re-measurement of
a study implemented in 2004 near Tusayan, south of Grand Canyon National
Park. The study fallows up on published research examuning the effects of
‘overstory thinning and prescribed fire Ireatments on tree size, disinbution,
species composition, and growth, understory plant species abundance and
diversity, and fuel loadings in pinyon-juniper woodlands,

Crews then spent the field season re-measuring plots on a landscape-scale
ecological restoration study near Mt. Trumbull, north of the Grand Canyon
Plots were installed in the mid-1990s over approximately 4,000 acres that have
since been thinned and prescribed burned. Data were gathered lo measure
‘overstory growth and survival, fuel loadings. efficacy of seeding, and
herbaceous understory composition

Lasily, crews collected historic and contemporary forest structure dala as well
as tire scar samples across tive, ~300-acre sites on the Prescott and Tonto
national forests, Thus study will provide baseline information an forest structure
and disturbance process to help inform management decisions regarding tuels

West-Wide. ERI staff are contributing to a book on the lessons learned and
success of the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration program. They met
together in Flonda with other authors to refine the chapters and develop key
policy recommendations based on the 10-year program, funded in 2009. Key
‘outcomes include better understanding the role of collaboration in federal land
planning, implementation, monitoring, and adaptive management processes

Partner Forest Projects. ERI Science Delivery staff worked closely with
Coconino County Parks and Arizona Department ot Forestry and Fire
Management to include a 15-acre forest restoration demonstration at F1. Tuthill
County Park in Flagstaff, AZ. Ft, Tuttull 1s home to the county fair and countless
other recreation events including local races, expositions, music shows, and
competitive horse events. The park averages mare than 200,000 visitors a
year. The restoration unit 1s adjacent to an additonal 240 acres of thinning and
restoration and will be complemented with visitar interpretation signage.

closely as a technical and collaborative partner with USFS: however, data
sharing among academic and land management agencies 1s challenging due to
both institutional and technical lmilations. The Kaibab NF approached ERI to
add capacity to forest plan monitonng, and also to better explore how to
increase efficiency 1n partner data collection that can be incorporated into
government data sets. The ERI collected data from 80 additional plots, adding
key variables of historic forest structure not usually collected by USFS plots
The data was collected using USFS data entry software, and entered into
USFS databases: the additonal data will be analyzed by the ERI 1o be included
