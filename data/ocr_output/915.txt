auector of forest operations and bomass utlizalion bringing 20 years of
expenence evaluating the economes and operational efficiencies of various
Umber and biomass narvesting systems Dr Han will ead a new program to

Dr. Han wil work coliaboradively with NALJ forest scientists, priveie incstry and

‘operations end the alization of wood for 8 wkle range of forest products. His
‘work also will focus on lessening ihe environmental impacts on vos and water

danger end improve forest health.

“Jem excited about my opportunity here at ERI end NAU,* Han said. “in my
experience working with fores! ecologists, sitvicuturiets and pobcymakers, the
challenge to improving forest health and achieving restoration is finding the.
‘ight operational tools, setting up optimal operational logistics, and making he
(best use of wood and biomass to get the work done in an environmentally
acceptable and financially eeasonable manner.”
