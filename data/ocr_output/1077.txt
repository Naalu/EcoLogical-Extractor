Using Drones. Airplanes and State-of-the-Art Technology
to Assess Forest Health

Researchers at Nothern Arizona Urwversity and the Ecological Restocabon
Insttute are using drones. apianes and stale-ol-the-art laser scanning
technology lo conduct forest assessments around GC Cragin Reservox in
nocthern Anzona

‘The researchers are partnenng wth analysis and proyec! managers al Salt

‘The study uses airplanes, drones and on-the-ground handheld inser scanners,
‘tao known 9s LIDAR scanners, to map ine forests by accursiely messuring the
forests’ complex structure using midions of 3D images produced by tiny lagers,

“This coleboration is in exciting opportunity to furthes our understanding of

Wide drones and handheld devices can provide highly detailed information at
line scales (.0., from on axividual tree lo a8 trees on hundreds of acres),

‘scanners mounted on piloted aircralt cen cover huge landecepes and all three.
