Broader-Scale Monitoring Workshops

The US Forest Service's (USFS) 2012 Planning Rule directs its Regional
Offices to develop a broader-scale momtonng strategy thal can intarm forest
management The goal ol broader-scale momtonng 1s to look across multiple
forests. incorporate common USFS forest plan questions. and provide
opportunities for coordination with partners. To assist in supporting the
development of a broader-scale monitoring framework, ERI 15 conducting a
senes of four workshops this spring across the USFS Rocky Mountain Region
(Region 2) and the Southwestern Region (Region 3)

Planners, momlonng specialists and data managers irom federal and state
natural resource management agencies. tibes. local governments. non-
government organizations. and academic nshtutions are participating in the

workshops to share existing efforts, identity gaps and data needs. and develop
strategies tor landscape-scale momitonng for forest planning purposes. The
workshop outcomes will be shared widely to aid other USFS regions n
developing similar processes to more effectively and collaboratively collect and
assess resource information and make management decisions

Research and Development
2016 Summer Field Season Outlook
By ERI R&D Stalt

Resource Objective Wildfire Project
There 1s increasing interest in managing natural hire ignitions to achieve
restoration objectives across forest landscapes. In 2015, we studied 10 large
“resource objective” wildfires on the Coconino and Kaibab national forests and
examined specific attributes related to forest structure, function, and fuels. In
2016, we will expand this research and field crews will collect data on several
additional fires. Research questions will focus on ecological conditions within
areas that have experienced more than one resource abjective wildtire.

Leroux Fire

The Leroux Fire on the San Francisco Peaks burned 1.240 acres of warm/dry
mixed conifer farest in 2001. In 2016, ERI crews will re-measure 24 sample
plots within the fire to better understand how fire severity and climate interact to
altect changes in species composition and vegetation structure. Information
trom this work will be useful to land managers tor planning post-fire restoration
actwities.

Wallow Fire



Page 8:
This summer marks the fifth anniversary of the Wallow Fire. the largest wildfire
ever recorded in Anzona, ERI crews will be revisiting mixed-contler momtoring
plots to record changes to the forest understory communities that have
‘eccurred since the fire. In addition, EAI will team up with entomologists from
Region 3 Forest Health Protection (U.S. Forest Service) researchers to study
post-fire bark beetle outbreaks in the treated and untreated areas, Results of
these projects will be reported im 2017,

G.A. Pearson Natural Area, Ft. Valley Experimental Forest

The G.A. Pearson site on Fort Valley Experimental Forest just west of Flagstatt
1s home to one of the oldest forest restoration studies in the Southwest. In
collaboration with Drs. Margaret Moore and Pete Fule (NAU School of
Forestry), Dr. Keith Moser (USFS Rocky Mountain Research Station), and Or
Fob Strahan (New Mexico Highlands Unwersity), ERI stat! and held crews will
collect data to investigate 20-year, post-restoration treatment responses at the
site during the summer of 2016. This research 1s being support by a grant irom
the Joint Fire Science Program

The mild 2015/2016 winter season has enabled the Agency Outreach group
(AO) to continue field visits with U.S. Forest Service (USFS) personnel on
several national forests im the Southwest. The AO group has tocused on data
collection and analysts on several key USFS projects in the agency's
Southwestern Region (Region 3). They also participate in on-going

rapid assessment data collection by working with the forest personnel to

White Mountain Stewardship 10-Year Final Report

The final report for the White Mountain Stewardstup Project (WMSP), which
concluded in August 2014, 1s being compiled and 1s scheduled for release in
late summer 2016. Dr. Yeon Su Kim, NAU School of Farestry, compiled the
economic assessment of the contract, which included detailed economic data
and surveys wilh woods product companies associated with the WMSP.

USFS Southwestern Region Outreach

The AO group has conducted rapid assessments and the installation of a
restoration demonstration unit an the Tres Piedras Ranger Distnct, Carson NF:
installed a mixed-conifer restoration demonstration unit on the Safford Ranger
Distnct, Coronado NF: conducted a rapid assessment analyzing MSO habitat
