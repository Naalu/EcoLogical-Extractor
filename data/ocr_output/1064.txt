Aeguiremnan far comsistracy. This report provides baneline spatial trecture metrics that ca be
‘axed in monisring and alaptive managemcat efforts. Howeeves tis important to waderstand that
metrics for spatial patiorms are sensitive tothe amalyais ucale, grain, Chematic defisitions,
‘taaaification scheme amd mthowis, e18ead of Mae analysis ares, aed minima patch ne fice
(Mamidion al 2013, Wataceman ¢t al. 2019). Comparing pre-and pou-treatment spatial
(paticrns with remote uemaing techaiques requires comisieacy im ete characteristics (Hamibo
4 al 2013), tel making direct comparisons to oles uimfirs is aot mevessarily appeapeate
