SOIL PROPERTIES ASSOCIATED WITH VEGETATION PATCHES
IN A PINUS PONDEROSA-BUNCHGRASS MOSAIC

Becky K. Kerns!2, Margaret M. Moore}, Michael E. Timpson’, and Stephen C. Hart!

ABSTRACT.—Since Euro-American settlement, fire exclusion and other factors have dramatically altered interior
western coniferous forests. Once open and parklike, present-day structure in many southwestern Pinus ponderosa
forests consists of dense stands of young, small-diameter trees, with small patches of larger, old trees, and relict open
bunchgrass areas. Our objectives were to assess differences in soil properties associated with these different vegetation
patches. We examined soil morphological characteristics, pH, organic C concentration, total N concentration, C:N ratio,
and phytolith concentration from profiles within 6 transects (18 soil pedons) crossing patches of dense stands of small-
diameter trees, patchs of old-growth trees. and open grassy areas. Results indicate that old-growth plots had signifi-
cantly lower A horizon pH and thicker O horizons than grass plots. In general, we found vegetation patches had statisti-
cally similar C and N concentrations and C:N ratios for A and B horizons; however, C in the A horizon was positively
correlated with O horizon accumulation (r? = 0.79). Greater accumulation of organic C in the A horizon of forested
areas contrasts with commonly reported results from mesic, mid-continental prairie-forest ecosystems but is typical for
many arid, semiarid, and humid savanna ecosystems. Phytolith concentration was similar among old-growth pine, dense
younger pine, and open grassy plots; the lack of a spatial pattern in phytolith distribution could indicate that grass cover
was more spatially continuous in the past. Additionally, this interpretation is consistent with current theories regarding

historical vegetation change in these forests.

Key words: forest soils, grassland soils, phytoliths, biosequence, nonmetric multidimensional scaling.

Woody plant abundance has increased sub-
stantially during the past several hundred
years in many of the world’s grasslands and
savannas (van Vegten 1983, Arno and Gruell
1986, Archer et al. 1988, McPherson et al.
1993). These increases have been attributed to
changes in climate, disturbance, and atmos-
pheric CO, concentrations. Prior to Euro-
American settlement in the interior western
USA, frequent fires maintained open, parklike
conditions in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa
P & C. Lawson) forests (Cooper 1960, Die-
terich 1980, Covington and Moore 1994a,
1994b, Swetnam and Baisan 1996, Covington
et al. 1997, Fulé et al. 1997). Fire suppression,
overgrazing, and a warm, wet climatic period
led to an irruption of pine regeneration in the
early part of the 20th century (Cooper 1960,
White 1985, Savage et al. 1996, Mast et al. 1999).
Present-day community structure in many
southwestern ponderosa pine forests is charac-
terized by a mosaic of dense stands of these
small-diameter trees, with small patches of

larger, old trees, and relict open bunchgrass
areas.

Some 60 years ago, Hans Jenny (1941) out-
lined the importance of 5 factors that control
soil genesis: climate, organisms, topography, par-
ent material, and time. Numerous researchers
have examined adjacent forested, recently
forested, and grassland areas to determine the
biotic factors. In mid-continental prairie and
forest ecosystems, coniferous and deciduous
forest soils when compared with grassland soils
can have, among other factors, thinner A hori-
zons, lower pH values, higher carbon:nitrogen
(C:N) ratios, and lower mineral soil organic
matter (C and N) accumulation, which decreases
more rapidly with depth (White and Riecken
1955, Bailey et al. 1964, Geis et al. 1970, Sever-
son and Ameman 1973, Ugolini and Schlichte
1973, Birkeland 1984, Anderson 1987, Zhang
et al. 1988, Almendinger 1990, Fuller and
Anderson 1993). This commonly reported pat-
tern in soil properties has also been used to infer
past vegetation change and ecotone boundary

stability (Birkeland 1984, Zhang et al. 1988,
Almendinger 1990, Fuller and Anderson 1993).
Differences in soil properties are attributed to
grasses being relatively higher quality sub-
strates for soil microflora (low C:N and lignin:
N ratio, higher pH) and depositing more organic
matter at depth via their root systems com-
pared with deciduous and especially conifer-
ous trees (Meentemeyer 1978, Anderson 1987,
Hart et al. 1992, Schimel et al. 1994). Almen-
dinger (1990) concluded that the magnitude of
these differences, particularly for soil organic
matter and total N, increases the longer the
vegetation persists.

Forest soils also have lower phytolith con-
centration by mass than grassland soils. Phy-
toliths are particles of hydrated silica formed
in the cells of living plants and are liberated
upon decomposition. Because of the high silica
concentration of grasses compared with conif-
erous and deciduous trees, soils beneath per-
sistent grassland vegetation typically contain
significantly more phytoliths by mass than soils
beneath forest vegetation (Jones and Beavers
1964, Witty and Knox 1964, Wilding and Drees
1971, Norgen 1973). Differences in soil phyto-
lith concentration have been used to decipher
changes in grassland and forest ecotones
through time (Miles and Singleton 1975, Fisher
et al. 1987).

Our objectives were to assess differences in
soil properties associated with contrasting
vegetation patches (sensu White and Pickett
1985) in a ponderosa pine-grassland mosaic.
We examined soil morphological characteris-
tics, pH, organic C concentration, total N con-
centration, C:N ratio, and phytolith concentra-
tion along 6 transects (18 soil pedons) from
clumps of old-growth trees, dense stands of
younger pine trees, and open grassy areas. We
hypothesized that (1) open grassy areas would
have soil properties typically associated with
grasslands, (2) patches of old-growth trees would
have soil properties associated with forests,
and (3) dense younger pine areas would have
soil properties transitional between these 2
areas.

STUDY SITE

The approximately: 2-kin? study site is located
in northern Arizona, USA, within the Fort Val-
ley Experimental Forest, about 10 km north-
west of Flagstaff. This area has never been

logged and is presently excluded from live-
stock grazing, although cattle and sheep graz-
ing did occur between 1876 and 1910 (Cov-
ington et al. 1997). Mean annual precipitation
is 56.7 cm, with approximately half falling as
snow in the winter and the other half as mon-
soonal rains from July through September
(Schubert 1974). This area has a mean annual
air temperature of 7.5°C and an average of 94
frost-free growing days. The topography is
fairly level (0%-5% slopes), and mean eleva-
tion is 2250 m. Soils are mapped as a complex
of fine, smectitic Typic Argiborolls and Mollic
Eutroboralfs that developed on Tertiary basalt
flows and cinders (Miller et al. 1995).

Ponderosa pine is the only overstory tree
within the study area. Understory vegetation
consists of bunchgrasses such as Elymus ely-
moides (Raf.) Swezey, Muhlenbergia montana
(Nutt.) A.S. Hitche., and Poa fendleriana (Steud.)
Vasey, and a variety of forbs (Kerns et al. 2001).
The only common shrub is Ceanothus fendleri
Gray.

METHODS

Six transects were chosen randomly from a
set of 20 intentionally selected to cross differ-
ent patches of vegetation. Along each transect
we established three 41-m? (0.01-acre) circular
plots for a total of 18 plots. Transects ranged
from 17 m to 26 m in length. Four transects
had the following 3 plot types: old-growth
pine, transition, and dense younger pine (here-
after, old-growth/young transects). The other 2
transects had the following 3 plot types: old-
growth, transition, and grass (hereafter, old-
growth/grass transects). We located plots on
relatively level terrain within the same soil
complex (Miller et al. 1995), on deep soils
away from rocky outcrops. Our goal was to
establish a biosequence with aboveground vege-
tation being the only variable that changed
(Jenny 1980a). We chose our plot size to be
slightly smaller than the smallest patches of
vegetation (Kenkel et al. 1989), which were
grassy areas. All old-growth plots were estab-
lished in the center of the tree patch, and all
transition plots were located just beyond the
canopy dripline of old-growth trees. Crass
plots were established within the nearby open
grassy area, and dense younger pine plots
were entirely within the stand of trees. Only 2
old-growth/grass transects were included in

the study due to the present-day paucity of
open grassy areas that were also accessible in
the study area by heavy equipment used for
soil excavation.

Field Sampling and
Laboratory Methods

For each plot we recorded tree density and
measured diameter at breast height (1.4 m) of
each tree. Trees less than breast height were
not counted. To determine age, we cored trees
at stump height (40 cm). All trees within the
old-growth plots were cored, and a random
10% sample of trees was cored in the dense
younger pine plots. Using cover classes (Dau-
benmire 1959), we estimated understory plant
canopy cover (shrub, forb, grass). Remaining
cover on the plot was assigned to other ground
cover classes (e.g., forest floor). Soil pits were
then mechanically excavated within the center
of each plot using a truck-mounted backhoe,
described (texture by feel, color, structure,
ete.), and then sampled by genetic horizon
(Soil Survey Staff 1993).

We collected phytolith samples prior to soil
excavation because backhoe use was restricted
during most of the summer due to severe fire
danger. This initial sampling allowed us to pro-
ceed with laborious phytolith extraction pro-
cedures. At the plot center we systematically
removed 10 mineral soil cores, separated them
into 2 depth intervals (0-2 cm and 2-7 cm),
and composited them by interval. The 0-2 cm
interval was chosen to represent the modern
soil surface, which should reflect contemporary
grass-tree vegetation patterns (Pearsall 1986,
Piperno 1988). The 2-7 cm subsurface interval
was selected because we wanted to sample
systematically only within the A horizon, which
can be as shallow as 7 cm in some places in
the study area. Phytoliths are rarely found in
other genetic horizons.

Tree cores were mounted and sanded, and
rings were counted using standard techniques
(Stokes and Smiley 1996). Soils were air-dried
before being ground with a wooden rolling pin
to pass through a 2-mm sieve, and a subsam-
ple was oven-dried at 105°C. Soil texture was
determined using the hydrometer method to
measure clay content (Gee and Bauder 1986)
and wet sieving to determine sand fraction.
We determined silt contents by difference and
soil pH values using a 2:1 (v:m) suspension of
0.01 M CaCly:soil (Henderson et al. 1993).

Samples analyzed for C and N concentra-
tions were finely ground using a ceramic mor-
tar and pestle. We titrimetrically measured
carbon concentration using a wet oxidation-
diffusion method (Snyder and Trofymow 1984),
which uses heat (120°C) to oxidize organic
matter more completely than traditional wet
oxidation methods do. Soils did not react to
dilute hydrochloric acid, and all pH values
were <7, accounting for our reporting C as
organic C. Total N was determined by Kjel-
dahl digestion and subsequent analysis of the
digestate on a Lachat AE Flow Injection Auto-
analyzer using the salicylate method (Lachat
Instruments 1992).

Using a modified heavy liquid flotation tech-
nique (Kerns et al. 2001), we determined soil
phytolith concentration gravimetrically. All ele-
mental and phytolith concentrations are ex-
pressed relative to the oven-dry mass of soil.

Data Analyses

Data were analyzed within each transect
type using a single-factor ANOVA, with plot
type (i.e., old-growth, grass, dense young pine)
as the independent factor. If statistically signif-
icant (a = 0.10), differences were compared
using Tukey’s correction procedure for multi-
ple comparisons (a = 0.10). We chose this
alpha level a priori due to our low sampling
intensity necessitated by the laborious nature
of soi] profile descriptions. Relationships be-
tween variables (C and N concentrations, C
concentration and O horizon thickness) were
explored using least-squares regression. Because
soil horizons were generally broken into several
units for sampling purposes in the field, we
calculated mean values for whole horizons using
a weighted mean based on subsample depth.
Mean values are reported along with 1 standard
error of the mean (+ sz). All statistical analyses
(except ANOSIM and the ordination described
below) were completed using SYSTAT 8.0
(SPSS Inc. 1998).

To examine the degree of similarity between
vegetation and soil properties considering all
variables together, we used 2 multivariate tech-
niques: ANOSIM, a multivariate analysis of
variance to test for statistically significant dif-
ferences (using a distribution-free random-
permutation procedure), and NMDS (nonmetric
multidimensional scaling), a robust ordination
technique (Kruskall 1964, Minchin 1987). Ordi-
nations are useful in showing spatial structure

of multivariate data and similarity and dissimi-
larity of samples, based on all variables of in-
terest considered together. The most important
property of an NMDS ordination is the pattern
of relative distances among pairs of points;
ordination axes are arbitrary and have no sig-
nificant meaning. Examination of plots of stress,
a normalized measure of badness of fit, versus
the number of dimensions (1-4) provides a
guide to the minimum number of dimensions
required to adequately describe the data (Kru-
skall 1964). For ordinations presented in this
paper, 2 axes appeared to adequately represent
the data sets. Both ANOSIM and NMDS were
performed using the program DECODA Ver-
sion 3.0 (software available from ANUTECH

Pty. Ltd., at | wwwaanutech.com.au/TD/
DECODA_WWWaAvelcome.html).

RESULTS

Vegetation

Statistical analyses of vegetation confirmed
our plot selection criteria (Table 1). For the
old-growth/grass transects, old-growth plots
had a significantly smaller percentage of grass
cover and more forest floor cover than grass

plots but no difference in forb or shrub cover
was found. For the old-growth/dense younger
pine transects, no difference in grass, forb,
shrub or forest floor cover was found. Dense
younger pine plots had significantly denser
stands of younger, smaller trees than old-growth
plots. Mean number of rings for younger pine
trees (60.7 + 1.6) plus 3-10 years to reach cor-
ing height (40 cm) indicates a germination
date between 1925 and 1932. Cores were not
cross-dated to check for missing rings, and it
is likely that some of these trees are from the
extensive 1919 cohort documented in the study
area (Savage et al. 1996, Mast et al. 1999).

Soil Properties

For the old-growth/grass transects, we de-
tected a significant difference for O horizon
thickness, an evident conclusion since only
the old-growth plots had a measurable O hori-
zon (Table 2). No difference was detected for
A horizon thickness. Soil texture of the A hori-
zon for all 18 plots was silt loam. A horizon pH
values were significantly lower for old-growth
plots than for both transition and grass plots. For
the old-growth/voung pine transects, old-growth
plots had significantly thicker O horizons

For phytolith concentration. lowercase letters also represent statistical results within the same cohimn ‘depth: P< 0.10%,

compared with transition and dense younger
pine plots, but no differences in A horizon
thickness or pH were detected.

For both sets of transects, we found few sig-
nificant differences among plots for A and B
horizons, C concentration, N concentration,
and C:N ratio (Fig, 1), Examination of individ-
ual transects indicates that C and N concen-
trations were generally lower throughout the
profile for grass plots than old-growth plots
(Appendix). The extent of this difference was
much greater for C. The grass plot from tran-
sect 18 showed an increase in C concentration
with depth in the A horizon, suggesting that
deposition of new material on an older surface
(lithological discontinuity) could have occurred
at this location. Examination of individual
transects also shows that old-growth plots had
generally higher C and N concentrations in
the A horizon compared to dense younger pine
plots, but C and N were very similar within B
horizons (Appendix).

Not surprisingly, analysis of C and N con-
centrations from all plots demonstrated a high
correlation between N and C (n = 79, r?2 =
0.94, P < 0.01). Carbon concentration in the A
horizon was positively correlated with O hori-
zon thickness (Fig. 2;n = 16, r2 = 0.79, P <
0.001}. Tvo samples were statistically tested as
outliers (Studentized Deleted Residual Proce-
dure, Neter et al. 1990) and discarded.

No differences in mass recovery of phyto-
lith material based on plot type were detected
for either depth (Table 2). Likewise, phytolith
mass was similar in the surface (0-2 cm) and
subsurface (2-7 cm) depths.

Ordination results show plot types distinctly
clustered based on soil properties (A horizon
thickness, O horizon thickness, pH in the A
horizon, and C:N in the A and B horizons; Fig.
3a), and these distinct differences among plot
types were significant (ANOSIM, P = 0.001, n
= 18). Note that dense younger pine plots
were grouped between grass and old-growth
plots. Because differences in O horizon accu-
mulation were so dramatic, we reanalyzed the
data without this variable. Removal of this
variable resulted in no significant difference
being detected, and the new ordination showed
that plot types were not as distinctly grouped
(Fig. 3b). However, some degree of separation
was apparent, particularly for old-growth and
grass plots.

Discussion

Frequently, detailed analyses and other fac-
tors limit extensive sampling and inference in
pedogenic studies; however, several interest-
ing results emerged in our study. The major
difference in soil properties that we detected
among our plots was that old-growth plots had

predicted, but in contrast to our hypothesis,
we found that soils from different vegetation
patches generally had similar C and N con-
centrations and C:N ratios. However. C in the
A horizon was positively correlated with O
horizon thickness. Greater accumulation of

mid-continent (White and Riecken 1955, Bai-
ley et al. 1964, Geis et al. 1970, Severson and
Ameman 1973, Almendinger 1990, Fuller and
Anderson 1993). However, this pattern has
been found in ponderosa pine forests (Potter
and Green 1964, Jenny 1980a) and is commonly
reported in arid, semiarid, and humid savanna
ecosystems (Jackson et al. 1990, Weltzin and
Coughenour 1990, Isichei and Muoghalu 1992,
Vetaas 1992, Mordelet et al. 1993, Hibbard
1995, McPherson 1997) and pinyon and juniper
ecosystems (Klopatek 1986, Tiedemann 1986).

Factors such as litter quality, microsite con-
ditions, and relatively low grass productivity
could explain higher C and N accumulation in
forested areas in arid and semiarid forest
ecosystems. In our study area grassland pro-
ductivity (11.2 g + m-2 + \~! for grassy areas;
Covington et al. 1997) is much lower than the
mesic mid-continental prairie, where tallgrass
and mixed-grass prairie ecosystems typically
produce 100-300 g + m-® + \~! (Barbour et al.
1999). In addition, O horizons were composed
predominantly of ponderosa pine needles, bark,
and woody material that had accumulated
beneath trees on forested plots. Ponderosa pine
litter is characterized by high C:N and lignin:N
ratios, which, in part, are responsible for low
decomposition rates of this litter type (Welch
and Klemmedson 1975, Klemmedson et al.
1985, Hart et al. 1992). Lack of a significant O

horizon and low soil C and N beneath grass
plots could be a result of more rapid decom-
position rates in these areas. Low levels of
nutrient accumulation can be characteristic of
rapid cycling rates, especially for more arid
ecosystems (Schlesinger et al. 1990). In an area
adjacent to our study area, Kaye and Hart
(1998a, 1998b) showed that mineral soil net N
mineralization, nitrification, and respiration
were significantly higher in patches of grass
compared to dense younger pine stands and

old-growth tree stands. Open areas also have
higher solar radiation, soil temperature, and
soil moisture during the growing season than
dense pine-dominated areas (Covington et al.
1997). Therefore, low soil C and N accumula-
tion beneath our grass plots could be the
result of more rapid cycling rates of material
in these areas.

Interestingly, phytolith concentration was
similar between plots for both the 0-2 cm and
2-7 cm intervals. The 0-2 cm interval probably
reflects the past 100-200 years (Fredlund and
Tieszen 1994), and the 2-7 cm depth an older
association. Our results do not demonstrate
the dramatic differences in phytolith concen-
tration previously reported from forest and
grasslands soils (Jones and Beavers 1964, Witty
and Knox 1964, Wilding and Drees 1971, Nor-
gen 1973, Miles and Singleton 1975, Fisher et
al. 1987) and could indicate that grass cover
was more spatially continuous in the past. This
interpretation is consistent with studies based
on fire history, historical photos, dendrochron-
ology, and inference from population structure
(Cooper 1960, Covington and Moore 1994a,
1994b, Covington et al. 1997, Fulé et al. 1997),
all of which suggest that historical expansion
of ponderosa pine has occurred at the expense
of open grassy areas.

In conclusion, the major differences in soil
properties that we detected were significantly
lower A horizon pH values and thicker O hori-
zons for old-growth plots than for grass and
dense younger pine plots. Lack of other statis-
tically significant results could be due to our low
sample size, inherent variability in soils, and
difficulty of truly isolating the tightly coupled
factors of soil genesis. For example, it is possi-
ble that potential effects of parent material and
soil texture have obscured organic matter pat-
terns derived from vegetation. Fine-textured,
smectitic soils derived from basalt parent mater-
ials have a high capacity to accumulate and
retain organic matter (Welch and Klemmed-
son 1973, Jenny 1980b, Nichols 1984). In an
ecosystem with coarser-textured soils, differ-
ences in soil properties due to vegetation may
be more pronounced. This could also explain
why marked differences in soil properties were
found in many classic forest-prairie transition
studies conducted in areas with recent glacial
parent materials. Yet, Welch and Klemmedson
(1975) reported greater C and N concentra-
tions in soils from grass openings compared to

young pole-sized ponderosa stands on similar
fine-textured (silt loam) basalt soils in north-
em Arizona. It is also possible that the tempo-
ral stability of vegetation patches in our study
area is insufficient to create a significant biotic
signature.
