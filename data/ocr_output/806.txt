Throughout the United States, snldfires have been aggresaively up:
pressed since the early 1900s, although this effort has likely been roost
succesful only afer about 1940 when modern vehicles and equipment
became available and rxtenaive road networks made remote locations
acceanble, In the Western United States, the area anmuslly burned de
ccrvased from the early [9008 into the 960s. then the trend reversed, wrth

since the mad-1980e ‘Agee 1993: This was exemplified by the fires that
‘burned in and around the Bitterroot National Forest in 2000fig 4), What
appears tobe different about the recent fires us the numberof nitions that
contnbuted ta berung large arrac More than 1,700 fire starts were
responsible for burning the 31 million acres of the Northern Rocky
Mountain in 1910, and 7H starts burned more than 350.000 serrs in the
Bitterroot Valley in western, Montane in July 2000 USDA Forest Service
197M, 2000: Contract these fire events to the 2002 Rodeo-Chedesk Fire
that was the reault of only two fire starte and burned more than 450.000
‘acres in Arizona. Similarly, on June 8, 2072, one start along, the Calorado
Front Range of the Rocky Mountains led to the Hayman Fire that burned
