‘thet his postion would be documented.

Ma. Sue Britting inquired about the application of the proposal for fisher management i the

Fahers vo fire.

Mi. Spencer responded to Mr. Rojan by explaining the fire modeling wes net inchuted in the
Proposal, and that they will wort on defining vseble metrics. Me. Spencer understood Mr.
Rojas’ concerns abour defining boundaries, and the importance of cresting a process for fisher

7. Landscape Planning Part 3 - Initial Sorting of Management
Actions

‘The group acticty was to decide which managemerst sctions were found to have general
conven. The group frst focured on eresion control, and ®t. Hanford mentioned the
ngortencs of cresting water bers, roling dips, dinching, and cleaning culverts as methods to
_echineing erosion management. Mr. Jones-Telin noted there srw moc strategies 00¢ listed.
Me. Goode wagested meadow and stream restoration, #5 well as planting native plants. The
(group agreed that no one was opposed to eration control.

‘The neat strategy the group discussed wees channe! stabllzation. Me. Van Velsor noted the Bast
Managemen Practices {6M} standards associated with channel stabilization. Mr. Kanga.
enantionad thet streams naturally ceandaer, and be stated thet channel stablkzation could lead
{To the “pond snd plug” method (digging out an eroded channel ling in cectalt vections, and
flowing over other vections of the eroded chanel]. Ms. Flick noted the case for naturally
‘occurring erosion in eveadows. Ma. Ballard commented tha the stracigies for channel
‘stabdization mighn hives to be decided case by cae.

Mis. Galtard explained 3 unumtion where soil protection is oveded. She used the example of 108
compaction due 10 eacess moisture. Mr. Hostord added that rocking the road and BAME"s wid in
{ll protection. Me. fojss acted another mathod of oping soll to loonen compaction. A. Very
\Vetior wugpested closing soll vanaiive areas to motorized vehicles. Me. Goode discunsed
‘considering tral coasre or tral reroute. Me. Rary Loclergue stated that high intensity fires leave
{il wulnerabie to eration near channels. Mr. Hanson noted thet high incensiy tires sn 3
‘aatural pact of the cycie, and ts not in wapport of censing the we of high intensity fires.

Mi. Hosford reloerated the importance of water bers, calling dips, grading and roadside Och
maintenance for reed mainnenence. Mr. Henion expressed that he bs act concerned wih road
enaintenance. ts. Briting noted tht hazardous tree comoval was inchuded with road
enaintensnice, which creamed controversy and 8 lack of convernuns. Therefore, the group noted
‘Pht road mairnanance was less prone to consenciet.

Me. Smith noted that grouping iswues would be helpful. Mr. Joner-Yelin expressed that the
exercive was geared ta focusing atforts on fasues that lacked converse. Ms. Ballard uapgested
cmarnbers create their own canegories of aus, and organize them accondngly. Ms. Beitting

Me. Fougtres suggested revising the landucape planning process. He aho noted the challenger
‘with the sheer scale of the Dinky ste, and ikdernifying the propered project tte. Mr. Jones:
‘Yellin fot that the work presented on March 15 wil ead to ares. of groeral agrwerent. he

bis expectations for the exercise, and anticipated identifying critical sues for further
