Evidence-based conservation:
a useful analogy?
» Medicine and conservation are not the
same, but there are some similarities
»> Definition of terms and methods is key
» Elements of this approach are already in use
» Follow-through on all steps in conservation
appear not to exist
» Focused effort is needed to explore costs
and benefits of E-B use in conservation

Page 4:
An outline of an
evidence-based approach

» Clearly identify the question—what knowledge is
needed?

» Systematic search for relevant knowledge, analyze
it, and make recommendations regarding likely
outcomes of treatments

» Communicate results in accessible forms

» Practitioner meets with patient (and family) to
select treatment
» Practitioner monitors and evaluates outcome


Page 5:
Might Evidence-based Approaches
be Useful in Conservation?

» So little time, so much to know—the journal
glut

» Need for timely and useful response to
knowledge needs—2 minute syndrome

» It’s not what we don’t know, so much as it
is what we know that isn’t so

» Objective, concise, and systematic analysis
of experimental and experiential knowledge
is hard to come by

16. Toward evidence-based conservation practice: a Policy framework for co-
ordinating sclence and practice -: ~

Organised by:
Andrew Pullin, University of Birmingham, UK
‘Willlam Sutherland, University of East Anglia, UK
email: a.s.pullin@bham.ac.uk; w.sutherland@uea.ac.uk

Goals:
To debate the value and timeliness of evidence-based policy:
To identify mechanisms for improving information flow between scientist and
practitioner; and,
To reach consensus on the next steps toward providing a greater evidence base to
conservation practice.

Exploring the Medical Analogy

» Diagnosis, prognosis, etiology, and therapy
» Who is the patient?

» Who are the practitioners?

» How are treatment protocols chosen?

» Who evaluates treatment effectiveness?

» Who does the systematic reviews?

» Who does the primary research?

» Who does the clinical research?

» Who pays for each of these?

Gaps in Applying Evidence-based
Approaches in Conservation

» Lack of clear identification of knowledge needs—
emphasis often “this is what we know” than “here
is what you asked for”

» Leap to primary research instead of first
determining what is known (secondary research)

» Narrative reviews instead of systematic reviews

» Failure to include systematic analysis of
experience-based knowledge (delphi, boards,
focus groups, etc.)

» Failure to follow through with practitioner and
“patients”

» Lack of seamless programs and adequate funding

» Identification of knowledge needs
» Knowledge discovery

* Secondary research—research reviews with
recommendations
* Primary research
» Knowledge analysis and synthesis
« Practitioner oriented status-of-knowledge
reports
* Systematic reviews

Systematic Reviews—A Rigorous Process for
Collecting, Analyzing, and Summarizing
Information

» systematically identify questions

» specify inclusion and exclusion criteria

» apply these criteria to potentially eligible studies

» evaluate the methodological quality of the primary
studies

» select an approach to data analysis

> analyze, interpret, and summarize the information
according to explicit rules that include examining
how effects may vary in different patient sub-
groups

» parallels exist for synthesis of expert knowledge
