Methods

3a 2016, with assistance fron the Forest Service, we sdeatifiod a landcape of just ones 29,700 acres
that had been managed pramanly wih resource objective wildfires dating back 10 2003 (Fig. L. page
22. Vung data from field plots ¢xtablubed wahia areas of varying bura teverity, we analyzed forest
stand viracture and canopy facia, and we modeied fire behavior Lo compare areas thal had bees
