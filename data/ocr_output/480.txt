Monitoring Workshop
October 15-17 the Southwestern Ecological Restorauon Institutes (SWERI) held » brophyzical monitonng workshop in Flagstalt, AZ for land manager and scientests
centutied: "Mowing Toward Tomorrow: Developing a Framework for Monitoring the Forested Ecosystems of the Southwest.”

‘The workshop was stimulated by a lick of effectiveness martanng being conducted on federal lands due te common mispercentians that mantanng has to be
expensive and exhaustive to be credible.

‘Trecugh series of presentations and collaborstive ducussions participants analyzed and agreed on a set of rebust and cost effective montonig variables, at both
the prnject and landscape level, that can be used by land mansyers and roentate In tracking the eflectiveneas of restoratbon and for informing adaptive
management. Participants also dacussed large scale obstacies and possible solutions te monitoring auch a8 collaboration, funding, sampling design, and data

Ian Hyp's Internship with WILDCOAST

{ apent the majority of tha summer (lune through early August) working for WiLDCOAST:-a non-profit organ zEb0"
in tenpersal Beach, Caiforns, WiLDCOAST is a brnabonal organization established by Sarge Devina in 2001 to
protect comstal land areas in tha Baja Periruada. Ax industry and tounem exptode on the Pacific Coast of the Bas
Perinaula, comstal habitats, including sea ture nesting sites and grey whale breeding waters, are threatened with
commeruial development and pollution. Bly warking with prvate landowners and the Mexican gavernments,
WILDCOAST strves ta ether establish land easements or purchase coattal lands for the use in conservation znd
ecotounsm. During my time with WiLDCOAST, [ participated in a wide array of grassroots support, including
community meebngs and watershed desnup. ! provided support for WILDCOAST's booth at a surfing competion,
| sand cagtie competition, and atthe Nabari Council af La RAZA Annual Conference where both Senator McCain
land then-Senator Obama made an appearance. Much of my be, however, was spent trying te find new sources of
funding that would allow expansion of WILDCOAST's land scquintian efforts, My focus was on carbon credits, This
Wa new rea for WILDCOAST, and 1 led the research to discover if st would be possible to gain carbon credits
through their conservation effarts, I gained valuabte expenance in research and praject development, grant
propos! construction, and the snnet workings of a non-profit organizaban,

‘After three montha af research I was disappointed that 1 would not be able to bring in money for WiLDCOAST, The
land that had been conserved wai not rich enough in species and, therefore, did not sequester enough carton ta
be accepted on the Chicago Chmate Exchange registry (one of the Undad States’ few international carbon markets). f did apen up the possibility for WiLDCOAST to
expand into hagher elevatians where there «x mare spenes nchness and ample carbon sequestraben. Before 1 eft, I developed a tender of specific procedures and
methodology for gaining project reqnitry theaugh the Chicaga Climate Exchange in areas where sufficient carbon sequestration may be present. Hapefully my
research eventually wll allow WILDCOAST fo gain praject registry and, ultimately, money for the use sn ather corwervation initiatives.
