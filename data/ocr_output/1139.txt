High ceverity wildfire activity in ponderoua pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (Preudotsuga
-menziesi foretts of the Southern Rocky Mountains has increased since the 1980s, and future
Projections suggest additional increases in area burned over upcoming decades (Coop et a1. 2022;
Kitzbergee et al 2017; Parks and Abatzoglou 2020; Singieton et al. 2019). In the intertor of Large.
treeless, high-teverity wildfire patches, where seed sources are distant, natural tree regeneration is
ofen insufficient to rresiablish forests on management-relevant timescabes (Chambers et al 2016;
Rodman et al. 2020e,b; Rother and Veblen 2016), Wildfire-driven fore loss can threaten important
ecorystem services nich ax carbon storage, wildlife hablint, recreational and employment
opportunities, and water supply, making i an important management issue (Coop et al 2020).

‘Tree planting is 4 cammon postfire management activity that may help to offset forest loa due to
high severity wildfire (Stevens et al. 2021), However the backlog of areas in the Southern Rocky
Mountains that require planting is formidable, and only gets larger cach year (Cook-Patton et al. 2020;
Fargione etal, 2021; Koll al. 2019), Figure 1 provides a Tough itusration ofthis polnt. According

to the USDA Forest Service Activity Tracking System (FACTS) database, annual postfire reforestation
ates in burned forests have been relatively constant aver the last 37 year, with approximately
24,000 hectare (60,000 acres) planted in total on National Forest System lands inthe Southern Racky
Mountains. n comparison. about 390,000 hectares (960,000 scres) hurned at high severity on national
forest lands durtng tis tame time period. While xome of this high-severity area may naturally

such of, forest reesablahment wil key require tee planting, Because tee planting requires a
considerable investment af time and money—seeds must he collected and grown into 1- ar 2-yearald
seedlings, planting sitrs must be dentiBed and prepared, and finally, seedlings must be planted —
cfficienty tackling the hacklog will require a detailed understanding of baw to beat allocate resources
Fargione etal 2021; Kall etal 2015).

(Chmate and topography are wo key constraints on natural postfire regeneration of ponderosa pine
‘and Douglas-fir in the Southern Rocky Mountains, a thete factors are also ilkely 10 influence the
‘survival of planted seedlings and the success of postfire planting projects. A lmple tool that uses
‘best available uedence to identify topockimaucally tuutable sites could help manager optimize the
‘mucreas of planting efforts. To that end, we have developed the Southern Rockies Reforestation Tool
«SRRT), which can be accessed a https :treesarethebeesknees.users earthengine 2ppview ste
reforestation tool. This document describes haw SRET works and how to use i We hope that this
‘ool will belp managers plan for large-scale, cimate-sultable reforestation of ponderosa pine and
Douglas-fir.

How SRRT Work:

‘The Southern Rockies Reforestation Tool uses fire severny, (ree extablishment, and gridded climatic
‘and topographic data to claaify locations from most to beast favorable for post-fire reforestation.
By using climate and terrain as proxies for voll moisture, this broad-<cale planning tool may
Increase seedling survival post planting by identifying locations with lower drought utress. SEAT
‘was developed using Google Earth Engine, « coud-based computing platform thats designed (0
efficiently perform calculations using spatial datasets scroas large areas. The tool requires only a
‘umall number of simple user-specified input, such as the area of interest, the species to be planted,
‘and the year the area was burned. In the background, the fool obtains and processes prefire and
poultire aatelite Images for the area of interest, and uses theve images (o Mdentfy severely burned
‘areas more than 200 feet (60 meters) from seed trees. Based on statistical models developed

an Rodman et al (2020e), 4 syntheuts of natural postfire regeneration in more than 1.300 plots
throughout the Southern Rocky Mountains climate and topography data are used to predict the
Jocationa that are most suftable for planted ponderota pine or Douglas-Sr seedlings following fire.
‘As the user, you have the option fo restrict the fire severity and seeding suutabilty Lzyers to places
“adjacent to roads and flatter slopes, where postfire planting may be mou! cost-effective and feauible
After fre teverty and seedling suitability Lzyers have been developed, you can explore them using
the Map Window by zooming and panning. There are also options to download the layers for use
1n geographic information eyitema (GIS) software such ax AFCGIS and QGIS. Currently, all suitability
_maps are restricted to historical species ranges, but maps that include upslope areas (ta help in
Planning assisted migration activities) will be developed in the future.
